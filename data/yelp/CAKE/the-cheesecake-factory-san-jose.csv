Richard P.,"San Jose, CA",124,7,4,5.0,1/1/2018,"I took advantage of the two free slices w/$25 egift card last week which tends to take place at the end of every year. It's new years so I assumed the wait would be long (was told 45 minutes when we arrived).  Decided to swing by the bar and luckily there were two empty seats. We were greeted by Julius and another bartender, both were very friendly and tended to us for all of our needs throughout our stay.  Ordered some finger foods from the light menu and a few drinks. Received some warm bread while we waited. Everything arrived in a timely manner and was very delicious. Had no issues using the egift card and free slice codes. Both pieces arrived very quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Jasmine P.,"San Jose, CA",174,103,382,3.0,12/21/2017,"The wait is about half an hour for an evening dinner on a weekday. It's not so bad since the restaurant is in a mall. They have a lot of seats for you to wait at or you can do a little shopping while waiting. After we got seated, it took a long time for the server to come by and take our orders. It also took quite a while for the food to come out. You get some bread and butter to eat while waiting for the food. The warm crab and artichoke dip was a good appetizer. It was very warm and gooey. Absolutely wonderful with the warm toasted bread that was served with it. The avocado eggrolls are a bit different, but the flavors worked out very well. The dipping sauce that came with it was also ice and tangy. The fish tacos were decent. I thought it was a bit dry. The tacos came with some beans and rice on the side. I've never really liked the ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory. Something about their lighting. It's just terrible lighting that just makes everything so dark and dingy looking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Shannen R.,"San Jose, CA",266,394,225,4.0,12/20/2017,"Oh the New Found Glory! No, not the rock band, the new cheesecake glory! Waited only 10 minutes on a busy Saturday afternoon to be seated - woo! Their Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake was delicious. It was flavorful, soft, and cheesy. I could pass on the whip but my S/O likes it. Their bacon cheese breadsticks are amazing. There was a tasty crunch to each bite. There was lots of bacon and lots of cheese, enough said. I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory but hated the long wait times.

Lauren Ashley G.,"San Jose, CA",496,294,1800,4.0,1/13/2018,"Love Cheesecake Factory but I hate the long waits. Usually in the earlier evenings they aren't too too bad and in this case they weren't! It literally was a 10 minute wait and we got lucky and found front parking. We sit in a dimly lighted table. I'm talking so dark I needed to use my cell phone light to read the menu. Food was decent as always so that's great. Cheesecake was phenomenal of course. The thing that also stinks is that it's at the mall which most Cheesecake factories are, and I usually try and avoid the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Christine H.,"San Jose, CA",68,304,1338,5.0,12/12/2017,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factories before, but this was actually my first time visiting the Oakridge location.  I stopped by here with my fam for a birthday celebration, and I really enjoyed the dine-in experience. We came in and were seated about 20 minutes later. We were paired up with Ashley (who was an excellent waitress by the way), and the rest of the night went well. 1) The bread and butter here are delicious and addicting (don't eat too much though because you might not have room for the actual entree). 2) We got all the correct orders, and our food arrived in a timely manner (20~25 min) for five dishes? 3) The Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta was...super good! It WAS expensive (like the rest of the dinner items here), but the portion was HUGE (probably enough for two or three meals, depending on your appetite).  4) Free birthday sundae for the birthday person? Great! It was actually good (but too much whip cream in proportion to the ice cream/fudge). A few down-sides: too dark (I know they're going for the whole dim thing, but it was hard to see even the face of a person across from us...then again, as long as you can see the people next to you, it's ALL GOOD-more intimate and private)+a little noisy (but what can you do? It's a huge restaurant?!)+crowded waiting area (There's already enough seating for around 12 people in the front, but the amount of people waiting seemed to be close to double that amount). All in all, the experience we had was great! Props to Ashley for her service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose

Amy T.,"San Francisco, CA",77,87,153,2.0,11/16/2017,"Came here on a Saturday night, it was packed.  Initially, I accidentally parked in one of the ""Cheesecake factory"" spots in the parking lot right in front of the valet area. It was too dark to see the first time, but good thing I double checked because in small black lettering underneath ""Cheesecake factory"" it says the limit is 10 minutes and this is a spot designated for picking up orders only. Don't make the same mistake as me! The wait was about 30-40 minutes, after I reparked my car, my party has already been seated so I started walking towards the back to the booths to find them. I guess I almost walked into the kitchen area because I was stopped abruptly by one of the staff working there. He was very assertive and pushy and asked me to go back to the front desk to be escorted to find my party.  I noticed the food at Cheesecake factory tends to be pretty much the same everywhere but the service can make a big difference. I know this is a very busy restaurant chain but the wait time between each time the wait staff came back to check on us was way too long. And we can tell because we were there for 1.5 hours and half of that time was just waiting for him to come back. Each time he approached our table, he was already getting ready to leave.  3.5 for the food, 1.5 stars for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose

UPDATE: the bartender I mentioned before was cool like I said but however I visited today and the new staff was unprofessional and weren't able to do there job. I asked for a table in the bar when I got there and they said no there's someone before you waiting for it, I said ok. 20 minutes went by and they still never filled the table. I told the hostess and she smiled and didn't say anything to me. She then went and found another set of people to finnaly and filled the table.

Nik R.,"San Jose, CA",103,8,4,1.0,11/18/2017,"It should be a ZERO rating. Worst service possible. We put in our food order right when we sat down and it's taken over an hour to get our dinners. They said that there was a long list of pastas in queue but the tables around us got their pastas and they have only been waiting 10-15 minutes. The manager came by and was no help. He made excuses and didn't say much. I understand restaurants get busy and orders take long but tickets shouldn't take 60+ minutes. I've worked at busier restaurants and never taken more than 30 minutes.  There are better places to eat that have better service than this establishment. Don't waste your time and money on the Cheesecake Factory. Our bill was $88 for average pasta that didn't have any fresh basil and a cold bang bang chicken and shrimp. Really disappointed in the quality of food and service. Also, my cheesecake is missing some of the top layer.

Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",970,1932,3488,4.0,12/14/2017,"I remember being in high school when this place first opened. There were always long waits and it was the fancier of meals my family would have. It was always a special occasion if you were dining at Cheesecake Factory (after all, there were table clothes and the waiters wore button up shirts with ties and slacks). My favorite meals here were the chicken madeira and chicken marsala. Dad would get some kind of steak dish and mom might get a pasta or fish. Can you believe the very 1st Cheesecake Factory was open in 1978? I had no idea this chain was around for that long. I came here for National Cheesecake day once because they had a buy one get one half off cheesecake deal. The menu here is huge and portions are large. Their plates are usually good enough for 2 people. I often want to finish my own plate but the calorie content in these dishes are high. The interior reminds me of an Egyptian-esque Vegas hotel casino lobby. It is dim with vaulted ceilings and an unidentifiable style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Melissa N.,"San Jose, CA",16,123,275,5.0,6/27/2017,"Regardless if the service is a hit or miss (this time was a miss, although I'm writing this review after the fact, so I forgot his name) the food is still really good. Every time I crave food from there, it always comes out cooked well and full of flavor.  For appetizers we ordered: calamari and chicken pot stickers. For entrees, we ordered: steak Diane and herb crusted salmon (factory combo) along with chicken Bellagio. The appetizers are always a hit, especially the calamari. The pot stickers were soaked in this really strong ginger sauce, and we didn't really like it. It was too over powering and just not to our liking. Next time we order that (and we will), we will mention, light on the sauce. Our entrees were made to order, especially my steak Diane. Medium cooked. Perfect We also had some adult beverages, blood orange mojito and typhoon punch, or something like that. Both were tasteful. I feel like the only draw back is that the lighting in the restaurant is so dark. I'm not really sure what kind of ambiance they're going for, but it's dark, for me. I don't really like that.

Danielle A.,"San Jose, CA",17,7,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"I wish I could give this restaurant ZERO stars, because I wasn't even able to be seated at a table properly. The hosts, who were not paying the slightest bit of attention to anyone, gave my table away to people that had not even been called yet. Just took them back, didn't ask for their name or anything, although I had just given the other host my pager. Then they proceeded to take two other parties to their seats, and then took others' names, until we said something. We had to explain to them what it was they did wrong, when they could not figure it out after giving them our name. The only response we then received was that it would be a moment while they got us another table. No apologies or anything, from any of the FIVE employees standing there. The no apology was a deal breaker for me, so I told them the table was no longer needed and left.

Astrid T.,"San Jose, CA",7,6,1,2.0,11/18/2017,"Such a well known chain where they seem to not care about good service but just about the money. We came in and while looking at the menu asked the front staff if they had nachos, we were told to go to the bakery and check because the guy ""didn't know the whole menu"". Unfortunately we decide to stay, the nachos were salty and greasy, not good quality but our bad for asking for such a dish in such restaurant... at the end we decided to take a cheesecake to go and Jesus (our bartender) asked us if we were ""going to order or not"" just because we were trying to decide which kind of cheesecake.

My husband had a procedure done early before coming here to eat lunch and was very hungry. He ordered off the GF menu and received a child's size pasta dish and was charged $16. When we asked about the portion the waiter Christopher O. Laughed and said to him,"" we only serve lunch portion now. I feel ya Bro I'm on a 4000 calorie diet"" and flexed his little muscle. Didn't offer to help the situation. He bring my dish and it's something I have never ordered ever. He makes a comment as he goes to order the correct dish, ""man it's too early""! Cones back 10 minutes later and brings yet a skinny pasta dish that's is on a menu on the table I never looked at. At this point I was done! I marched straight to the manager who didn't care and didn't believe me and didn't try and help.

The customer service was GREAT because my server Lisa was super sweet and attentive BUT the food was meh. I had the Goat Cheese and Beets salad and lunch sized Meat Loaf. The Goat Cheese and Beets was flavorful and delicious but the size was teeny for the price. The Meat Loaf with Mash Potatoes and Corn was not good at all. The meat was wayyyyy to salty and the potatoes were extremely cold. I was hoping my Reese's cheesecake would make up for it but it did not. The amount of sugar was deadly.

Had to wait 5 minutes to be seated even though there was plenty of space, which was fine. Service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. Food was okay (nothing special) although the sundae was enormous and the chocolate sauce on the side was a nice touch. Happy also to see lunch portions service quite late into the afternoon. Wish I'd hit the restroom before ordering, though. I tend to judge restaurants by their restrooms. This one was absolutely disgusting. The restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned (or restocked) in days. Virtually every stall was filthy and the handicapped stall lacked toilet paper. I always wonder if a bathroom looks this filthy, what does their kitchen look like? It didn't help that all but one soap dispenser was empty. Hope the workers were able to wash their hands. This is clearly a poorly managed facility. I don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory often but I've historically associated it with a basic level of quality and service.

Scott B.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/22/2017,"This is the third time I have eaten at this restaurant and the last time I will eat at this restaurant. Tonight I decided to try their Old Fashioned Hamburger for a second time to see if they could do any better than the last time I ate at this location.  They didn't.   On the previous visit, the hamburger was ordered with no pickles, no onions and no mayo and medium well done.  The hamburger arrived with everything on it and the inside was basically raw! They sent it back two times and still couldn't get it right.  At least that time they didn't charge me for the meal.  Fast forward to this attempt: I ordered it the same way except at the waitresses recommendation I ordered it well done.  Again it came with everything on it: I sent it back and all they did was remove the mayo, the pickles and onions and sent it back out.  The burger had a overwhelming taste of pickles and was cooked as though it had been at ground zero in a nuclear bomb test!  I thought of sending it back a second time, but having waited for the burger to arrive for over 45 minutes I decided to just take it home and feed it to my dog!  He seemed to enjoy it!   My son ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and found his meal to be lacking any real flavor or Parmesan cheese, he also said this is the last time he will eat there too!  Perhaps this restaurant should employ some cooks who actually read english( I was told most don't speak english or read english) so it's no wonder they can't get the order right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=120
Pat H.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",11,1,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I have been ordering Cobb Salads at the CF for over 20 years, starting at the one in Beverly Hills. They are amazing, and always consistent.....the same every time. The wait for food at the CF on Blossom Hill in San Jose was an eternity, even though the restaurant was the emptiest I have ever seen it (maybe THAT was the red flag I missed). The concoction that was presented as a Cobb Salad, while technically a Cobb Salad, did not remotely resemble what they usually present. The Cobb from CF is always pre tossed, with all the ingredients mixed in, a ring of riced egg around the edge, lots of succulent chicken, and thick crispy bacon throughout. The one yesterday had the ingredients sectioned on the top, bacon bits, very little dressing drizzled on the top (it was very dry, and I had to ask for more). The salad wasn't bad enough to send back, but it was not their usual, and was the same as ordering a hamburger and getting a hot dog. I would never have ordered this if i had only known what I was getting.  The bottom line is that after all of these years, I don't know if I can ever go back. Consistency is key in a restaurant, and I never want this to happen again............and the only way I can think to avoid it is to avoid the Cheescake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=120

It was our guests first time, and this is our favorite spot so we were excited to treat them. We were seated in the bar area and at first our service was great. Our server took our drink order and we placed an order for buffalo blasts and avocado egg rolls to start. That's when everything fell apart... Our avocado egg rolls came out on time, but our waiter came back and said ""the Buffalo blasts needed some more tlc so they're gonna be a few more minutes"". 15 minutes later we are done with our avocado egg rolls, we placed our entree order, and managed to get several refills and still no blasts. Our waiter has been avoiding our table ever since. After several attempts to try and get his attention I finally caught him by the kitchen and asked again about the blasts. He says ""I'll check on them, it'll be just a few more minutes"".  At this point I asked for a manager. It took 20 minutes for Hana to come over, only to offer us some sorry explanation, and ultimately I managed to get her to admit that the Buffalo blasts were never prepped.  We finally received our blasts and entrees. Our server was still running around the bar area, socializing with all his tables, it'd be nice to have him check on us. Towards the end we decided we wanted dessert, there was no desert presentation. He assumed he wanted our cheesecake to go until we told him it was for here.

Elena N.,"San Francisco, CA",1407,2427,10573,3.0,12/14/2014,"I used to live in the suburbs, so I've gone to my fair share of chain restaurants. But living the last 8 years in SF has spoiled me. The last place I normally want to go is a chain restaurant. That being said,  Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains. They have a huge menu, so you can basically order whatever your heart desires. Plus, there's the cheesecake! *Mumm napa, brut prestige, napa valley, sparkling wine ($13 split) *Mini crabcakes ($13.50): served with mustard and tartar sauce *Avocado eggrolls ($10.95): avocado, tomato, red onion & cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper, with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce *Cajun jambalaya ($17.95): shrimp & chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a spicy cajun sauce, over rice *Spicy chipotle chicken sandwich ($11.95): crispy coated chicken breast w/melted cheese & spicy buffalo on a brioche bun w/fries *Shrimp scampi & steak diane ($19.95): shrimp w/garlic, wine, basil, tomato; steak w/peppercorns, mushroom wine sauce; Salad *Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake: layers of rich brownie, kahlua cheesecake, creamy chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache *Peppermint bark cheesecake: white chocolate cheesecake w/chocolate peppermint bark, white chocolate mousse & chopped peppermint I went with the roommate's siblings, so there were 5 of us. Since he's been here so many times, he tends to order the same thing every time: avocado egg rolls, jambalaya and kahlua coffee cheesecake. All were good choices and he seemed to enjoy them. I however, can get overwhelmed by the huge menu and have no idea what to order. I ended up getting the mini crabcakes and the combination plate of shrimp scampi and steak diane. The crab cakes were good. The cakes could have been a little crisper from the sear since they were a little mushy. But it had a good amount of crab. The steak and shrimp were okay. The steak is served in three individual pieces, so if you like your meat rare, it will be over cooked. The shrimp were a good size and came in three as well. The sauce was a little too lemony for my tastes though. I did like the mixed green salad with their balsamic though. For me, the main reason to come here is the cheesecake. I ended up getting the peppermint cheesecake since it was seasonal and I do love peppermint! It was wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be which was good. And I loved the addition of the candy cane pieces on the whipped cream. I didn't care too much for the crust since it was too dense, but overall I enjoyed the slice. One of the drawbacks to Cheesecake Factory is they don't take reservations, so there's normally always a wait. I think we waited about 20-30 mins last Sunday around lunchtime. Not too bad compared to other locations I've been to. For a dining option at Oakridge, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the better ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=120

To start, this particular location doesn't get extremely packed except on the weekends but still the wait is a bit shorter then at Valley Fair Mall. It's located inside Oakridge Mall so there's always shopping during the wait. The house bread is sourdough or brown and always comes out warm. The menu offers a skinnylicious option which seems healthier the. Most of the options they have. The chicken pasta from the skinnylicious menu was made of the noodle pasta that seemed kind of card board like and dry but it was ok. The skinnylicious salads are very good I like the Mexican one as it has a crispy taste with the tortilla chips and a good mixture of greens and corn too. The miso salmon is always a good choice especially for lunch.

But I turn over the bun to the bottom side and find they just scraped the cheese off. It would be a big deal if they actually got all of it off but they left a bunch on there and I'm lactose intolerant.

Even though we could see our table was ready with table ware n everything for the past 30 minutes (as we were waiting on the outside and asked for our table outside they didn't want to let us sit. It was more of a power struggle. Cause it was few minutes before '2 hrs' (mind you we had 3 kids with us) why not just let us sit and settle down. The person in the front kept saying 2hr wait and we won't know until another few minutes. We asked him to come outside and see from his eyes that the table is ready. But he said No to that. He just wanted us to wait and how dare we question him before our time. The table is set for 9 ppl outside for the past 30 minutes. It was our table. He was just very rude. We called the manager, Vincent, he made us sit there right away but no apology or anything. Finally sitting down. Ready to order. We wanted to order pasta for kids with a small change. Change white sauce to pesto sauce. Apparently that was too much for the kitchen to understand. We ordered the big plate in the end for them to share. Then we ordered Nachos without sour cream and add beans. But of course, it had sour cream and no beans. In addition to partly stale nacho chips. Asked for extra plates, they were dirty.

This burrito should be called a Rice Burrito, with a little bit of chicken and cheese. I asked for no onions, but then got no peppers (which I wanted). How can Cheesecake Factory feel good about themselves when the rip off their customers for $17.99 for a rice burrito? I complained about it, and they made me another one.

She dug and dug and dug and barely found any chicken in her salad. I didn't realize there was a National Chicken shortage happening... maybe it's due to the hurricanes. What a rip-off!

As you can imagine I was furious so I called back and asked to speak to the manager who ""happened"" to answer the phone & said his name was Vincent, I explained to him what had happened and asked him what the average wait time was, and if that was how they usually handle phone orders and his words to me were, ""Sorry that happened, we have 2 bakers taking orders & we can't exactly hang up on the orders coming in to take your order, I guess we could have gotten on the phone to tell you we are trying to get to you and to hold on, we are working on getting better.""  Well I'm sorry if you have 2 bakers taking orders and so many orders coming in that a person has to wait on the phone for 25 minutes only to be hung up on, that sounds to me like there is nothing really being done here to help cheesecake truly working on things getting better. Maybe the bakers should be in the back baking, I'm pretty sure cheesecake makes enough money to hire additional people to answer phones so that people aren't having to wait on the phone only to be hung up on. On average my family has had dinner through cheesecake twice a month and this is just the final straw for me. As you can imaging it was already frustrating holding for so long but they were busy and I understood that, and secondly mistakes happen I also understand that but when you are a manger it is your job to diffuse bad situations even when you aren't the cause and I just feel that on top of everything that already went bad Vincent also could have handled the situation better and diffused it much better than he did. So though this review is explaining 1 particular incident it's the final straw that caused me to write this particular review and as far as their customer service goes cheesecakes gets 0 stars, and because of the way they treat people and their poor customer service skills I won't ever be ordering through door dash anymore either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=80
Sara H.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/4/2017,LOVEEEEEEE comign to this location. I always get way better service! Got my food lickity split! My go to spot. The waiter( didn't get his name) was outstanding,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=80
Julia H.,"San Jose, CA",85,148,327,3.0,4/8/2017,"The wait was typical for a Friday night, 30-45 minutes. The service was excellent, the waitress did everything she could within her means. The wait time for the food was about 35 minutes which I felt was pretty normal. My food, sadly needed to be returned. I ordered the vegeburger with French fries. The picture I took was before I attempted to eat my burger. As soon as I picked up my burger I felt the soggy bread, which I felt was because after the burger was made it just sat there. I was okay with this. The part that got me was when the patty broke into small pieces and fell out of my burger. It literally looked like I ordered a rice dish.  I had to wait about 5 minutes before my waitress walked by, and I asked her if this was the norm. She said definitely not and offered to make me a new one. At this point by husband was half way done eating, so I felt that I couldn't wait another 30 minutes for my food. I ended up opting for something that requires no cooking. I ordered Cesar salad and clam chowder. The chowder was completely disappointing as it tasted like potato soup. The salad was yummy, but you can't really go wrong with Cesar salad.  All in all, it was a very average experience. My husband did enjoy his ribeye, and I loved the complimentary bread, and I did enjoy the egg roll appetizer! Yummy sauces! Also, the waitress did take the burger off our bill. Yet, we ended up paying for the salad and soup which I didn't feel like eating and was my only option because my husband had already started eating his meal. By the time my salad and soup came out my husband was done eating. I ended up taking the salad and soup home and is still sitting in the fridge as I am writing this review. Watching my husband eat isn't my ideal date night, and having to order on a whim anything that can be made quickly and having to pay for something I didn't want or eat, well it could have been a little better.  Still, I do like this place and I'll be back. Maybe at that time, I can update this review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=80

John L.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Was in San Jose today (coming from Monterey County). I was in the mood for Chicken Costoletta and thought I would place a to-go order. Some guy picks up the phone, I told him what I wanted to do, and he said ""I'll transfer you over to the bakery and someone there will take your order. So I was put on hold and I waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Finally I hung up and decided to talk to the manager. When I called back, someone named Kelsey or Chelsea answered and identified herself as the manager. I told her that apparently, no one there is interested in picking up the phone to take orders. I suggested that she tell her staff to make sure that they make sure that someone is available when transferring calls. Don't eat at this restaurant.

Alazaya K.,"San Jose, CA",30,42,7,4.0,10/9/2016,"It's been so long since I've been to cheesecake so I decided to revisit it. To be honest, I last came here two years ago and the food was just ok for the pricing of the place. Yesterday I came around 7pm and waited for 25 min which wasn't too bad because it was super duper busy. My boyfriend and I were seated outside and our server was named Roger! He was great at helping me choose between items I wasn't sure on and was also content on checking up on us, making sure we enjoyed everything okay. I ordered the chicken Madira, 3/5 it was good, the dish came with asparagus, sautéd mushroom, mashed red potatoes and also chicken with mozzarella cheese on top. Now for the chicken, they were moist... THOUGH they are very very thin pieces of chicken lol. It's like a chicken breast but they slice it horizontally into 4 long pieces and cut it up into half and only serve 2 pieces of chicken on the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Cajun pasta, he says it's a 4/5 it was a big portion and had a good spice to it. I even noticed the chicken in his dish was bigger than mine ;( Anyways, we also got the strawberry slushee, 5/5 served in a really big cup! Enough to satisfy two people. It wasn't too sweet, tasted real fruit bits which was gooood. It also came with a big strawberry and orange slice as well :) Aaaand last is the stuffed mushrooms. Came with 6 big mushrooms in a cream sauce and cheese. Really good! 5/5. Our bill ended up being nearly $60 which wasn't bad at all!  Overall, this place is has good food. No complains ( aside the thin pieces of chicken ) it's very nice and elegant on the inside, they have a nice big bar which seems to be just as busy as the restaurant itself. They have a variety of different cheesecakes on display and they all look super delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=140

Debbie T.,"San Jose, CA",22,70,,1.0,11/12/2017,Usually I don't bother to write bad reviews because everyone has an off day once in a while but last night (sat 11/11 around 8pm) I went in to order 4 cheesecakes Togo. I expected a wait because they were busy. 15 min later I see the cheesecakes I ordered placed on the counter on plates. I figured they mistakenly made it for dine in instead of takeout. Everyone was busy so my boyfriend took the receipt to a bigger guy wearing glasses at the end of the counter. Without even checking he said no and waved us away. So back to waiting we went even though I was pretty sure another person did not order 3 white chocolate raspberry and one fresh strawberry.. a few minutes later we asked one of the cashiers and she went to check all the receipt and went to check the ones at the counter and turns out those were ours and plated by mistake. The guy that said no to us saw her taking the plates back and turned and walked away.. not even acknowledging he was wrong. He needs additional customer service training. It takes a certain level of lazy to not even take 2 steps to his left to check for us. 5 stars for everyone else who was working hard while that guy just stood there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=140

To wrap this up the manager really didn't care how bad my experience was, he never gave me eye contact or actually cared that you dinning experience was so bad. The icing on the cake, or should I say cheese cake, he made me pay for the red velvet cake instead of comping it, wow way to go cheese cake, 0 in my book today.

One Cheesecake Factory is pretty much just like any other Cheesecake Factory, but this one has a better parking situation from what I can tell. And a nice patio area. And they have a Forever 21 right next door, so I can go shopping (or looking, at least) with buzzer in hand. Service is good and food is consistent with other locations (tasty!).

My date and I came in at around 7:00 or so and asked what the wait would be- there was none. We wanted to wait a bit to get some shopping done and they were very polite about it. When we decided to eat later they just put our name on the list to make our seating  quicker. The hostess was very sweet and cheerful, though I didnt catch her name. She was small and blonde, wearing a white scarf. When we came back later (around 9) she helped us again, recognizing us and leading us directly to a booth. I didn't like the seating too much as we were right by the ""server station"", if you will, but as my date and I are fairly young and underdressed, I can understand if they were simply trying to avoid a dine&ditch.  The bread that was served was very good! We were super hungry so it was gone in minutes- bad idea! I ordered the fish tacos and was full one taco in :( My date helped me, while enjoying his bacon burger. He says its ""REALLY good, one of the top burgers I've had"" and while eating, ""the patty is cooked perfectly, exactly what I wanted."" My tacos were very good, I was only expecting two and recieved four, and I was impressed with the flavor. The drinks are pretty pricey, a soda was 3.25. My waitress' name was Sierra, she was super sweet and just the right amount of attentive. Offering me consistent refills and not overwhelming us with wellness checks while we were eating. It seems she's been doing this for a while, I really liked her!

It took them over 45 minutes to seat us. STRIKE 1! Our food came out all wrong. The cooks back there could not hit temps AT ALL. Two steak entrees came out Medium Rare instead of Medium Well. Aside from it being hard, the breading on the chicken sandwich was so burnt, it was almost black. On top of all this, they brought out everyone's entrees at different times. Why run food for a table of 6 before completing at least half of the ticket?! I am putting this all on the kitchen. STRIKE 2!  Sh*t happens, I get it. I spoke to John, the manager on duty. Instead of being apologetic, he was dismissive and defensive. He had the audacity to tell me that the chicken sandwich was perfectly fine because he checked the temperature himself. He would have had a valid argument if we complained about undercooked chicken, but the problem was with the texture, color, and presentation. His attitude was unacceptable, and I refuse to believe he was properly trained as a manager-- especially from a corporate restaurant chain. He definitely does not belong in the service industry.  We cancelled the chicken sandwich altogether. We sent back one of the steaks to be brought up to temp, and just packed them both to-go. 3 hours and $200 later, we left the restaurant irritated and still hungry. What did the manager John do? NOTHING. He offered no solution, but a slice of cheesecake on the house. Why would I want dessert when I did not even get to eat dinner??!!! No thanks. Keep your cheesecake, John. STRIKE 3!

Huge straw and delicious whipped cream ***chicken tenders and fries: it was okay, nothing special, fries just a tad salty",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=180

We were behind two women that were also a party of two, when they were called (9:30 PM), we knew we were going to be the next party of 2. We wait and they call out two more party of two that had checked in after us. We informed the front desk that we were waiting and that the people that were called came in after us, the front desk told us that we would be seated next. Two more party of 2 were called, we tell the front desk and they apologize and say that we would be next. It was already past 9:50 PM, we gave the pager and left. I am very disappointed in their service, even after informing them that people that had checked in after us had been getting seated, they didn't make an effort in aknowledging our presence and patience for their mix up and instead kept seating others.

How the fuck was I supposed to know that? 2nd of all come to find out they keep putting me back in line without telling me that I've been skipped and maybe its because Ive been outside? I was so hangry by this point I ask for a supervisor. I talk to this bearded gentleman probably 30's and he was like ""yeah okay?"" with a confused look on his face, I told him which girl I kept asking and she never told me anything about staying inside. He was like okay Im sorry about that. I was so livid. I used to come here allot actually. But honestly lately the quality has gone down.

Harini V.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I usually don't review  a place unless it's exceptional or really disappointing. Latter is the case now.This cheesecake factory location near valley Fair Mall , San Jose is unbelievable. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm and the wait was 30-50 mins which is acceptable, but even after my buzzer went on we were not seated saying 'it doesn't work that way ' ,why the hell did you give me that thing then.. well, after we were seated, for 20 mins! ,none of the servers cared to come, let alone take our orders. I really want to mention my order number which is 27 on the 19 th of March ,server was a tall well built man who couldn't understand what we were ordering and had to look at the menu which my guess should be a new recruit and who didn't care enough to bring us our water after waiting for 30 mins. Later we had to ask an Asian guy who was serving the next table for what's happened to the starter bread and water, he was like am not 'responsible for ur food n ur service okay!' and he was talking to me like am a freaking 3 year old  and man don't I know servers take up alloted tables in a hotel , can't he be at least courteous enough to say 'ok, I will look for ur server  and bring some water in the mean time'. After a gruesome wait we had to stop a man who was not our server AGAIN and ask to at least bring our drinks, he passed us 3 times after that without glancing . How can I blame him if 'my table's server' didn't even bother to show up after all our talk with the manager which was after 45 mins wait . The manager who was a lady was like u don't have to pay any bill , I didn't taste any damn thing in ur restaurant to take out my wallet.  The worst worst part of everything is we had a 2 year old with us and inspire of telling them we had to feed the baby, their response was 'there was some miscommunication and your table didn't show up in the list to be served'...

Laarnie B.,"Edenvale, San Jose, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/8/2017,"I've been a loyal customer at this particular location and I've been coming here since it first opened. Today was the WORSE day I have ever experienced customer service, mainly with the front of the house host and manager. We came tonight to celebrate my nieces 8th grade graduation and from the look of it many other were celebrating their own. I made reservations at 5:18pm and the host ""Sasha"", if that is her real name and why doesn't anyone where name tags?. She told me an 1 and 1/2 wait for 7 people. I agreed and I gave her my number, she told me she will call me when our seats were ready. I came back in to check if maybe we got bumped in early, this was at 6:38pm. She then told me another 30 minutes. I said ""ok, we will wait"". As I stood there,  I can hear her tell other customers 3-4 hours, then tell another group of people 15- 25 minutes. I should have known at that point that my family and I were going to get screwed. But I put it in good faith that in 30mintues our table will be ready.  We waited outside, it was getting crowded. At 6:56pm we came back in. I held my phone in my hands to see if they would call me on my phone and waited to see if they would call me out loud. Ay 7:06 pm my sister waited in line to asked the same host if we will be seated soon, since its been 1 1/2 hrs already. While my sister was waiting I can hear Sasah, tell certain customers 45mins wait and tell others 15minutes wait. I want to know HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? WHY WOULD A HOSTED JUST GIVE RANDOM TIMES OF WAIT?  By the time my sister got to her, she said we have no seats. I came in and told ""how is that possible, we have been waiting over the time she told us?"" She exclaimed "" we've tried calling you"" I told her ""My phone never went off"" with a ton of back and forth she continued to argue with me and then the manager stepped in. With no apology for the inconvenience, he proceeded to still blame me for their mishap. He read out loud my phone number, he begain with 89 and I stopped him, letting him know my first 3 digits were 507. All three, who were behind the counter, Sasha, the Manager and a man named Bernard, (How I got their name?.. I asked their co workers later that evening), still persisted to blame me for giving them the WRONG phone number. WHICH IN FACT WASN'T, because Sasha repeat my number to me as she punched it in. DON'T Lie! The manager still said till be a 30 minute and another man said we'll get you in in 15. Customer service tonight was RIDICULOUS!!! I feel bad for every customer tonight who got duped. We did stay. My niece set her heart out on having her Graduation Dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. I want to shout out to our server, Ileianna J and the other serves who helped her bust out our food and beverages. Shout out to the cooks and bussers, I know its a very busy night. As a person who has worked in the Hospitality Business for over 14 years, that was unprofessional and down right dirty. Some training and better time management for the host an over view on how to make the reservation system less flawed with help bring in more business. Telling people 3-4 hours for the next available table and others 15 - 20 minutes is money out the door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=200

Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439,3.0,1/19/2014,"My first attempt at this place was quite frustrating. I know happy hours are usually Mon-Fri but that is exactly why I called Saturday morning to make sure. A girl answered the phone and told me yes, they did have happy hour. My friend and I made the drive there and was told that in fact they do NOT have happy hour. I know it wasn't the hostess' fault because I don't know who I spoke with, but I let her know exactly how upset I was at being misinformed. The staff needs to get their information straight before answering customers' questions. My second attempt at coming for happy hour was much better. I called ahead again to make sure and was told it was Mon-Fri 4-6. It was a Friday evening and we came right at happy hour. You have the choice of either sitting at the bar, the tall tables, or a booth. My friend and I preferred the booth because it was a little bit cozier.  The menu was already on the table for us when we were seated. $5 drinks and appetizers during their happy hour which is a great deal. They had a few drink selections such as margarita, j.w.'s pink lemonade, mojito, and long island ice tea. I asked the waiter which drink was sweetest and he suggested the pink lemonade which I absolutely loved! My friend got the margarita, blended, and it was good but a bit salty for my taste. Their choices for appetizers are great. I ordered the road side sliders and the avocado eggrolls. I've had them before so I knew they were going to be great. The bun on the sliders were so soft and warm when they were brought out. The dipping sauce for the avocado eggrolls were definitely the highlight of the dish. For dessert I got my usual, the ultimate red velvet cheesecake! Who doesn't love cheesecake and red velvet?! It's heaven on a plate! Be warned that it is a rich piece of cake that you might want to share or it can be overwhelmingly sweet. Unfortunately I didn't catch the name of our waiter but he was fantastic! Took our order promptly, checked on us multiple times, brought us complimentary bread and butter, even made sure I liked my drink and was ready to bring me a second. If you were to come during regular hours I definitely suggest getting the chopped salisbury steak or the four cheese pasta with chicken!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=200

The bread here is delicious and the rest of the food was great, too. I love how our waitress kept coming over and refilling our waters. A+ right there! Fried calamari was pretty gummy, but in a good way. Good portions and it came with the standard red sauce and tartar sauce. I actually can still remember how yummy the nachos were, too. We got sour cream and guacamole on the side of course, since Tyler hates that stuff, but all around, the pico de gallo, cheese, jalapenos and chicken all were great on the chips. I think the reason why it was so delicious was because the chips tasted fresh. I tried looking for the name of what I ordered, but I couldn't find it. Huge portions though, I was the only one who couldn't finish my food. My boyfriend ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and he devoured it in about 5 minutes, not going to lie.  My sister ordered a sandwich that had chipotle mayo in it. I'm guessing it's the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and her boyfriend ordered some pasta with chicken and red sauce. He finished his pretty fast too, so that's a sign that he enjoyed his dish, too. Sorry for not being too specific. Two appetizers and four plates, the bill came out to a little over $100.

Alec M.,"Tracy, CA",17,153,32,1.0,12/14/2015,"The most disappointing Cheesecake Factory experience we've had, and we've been going to them for more than fifteen years. My sister and I decided to eat at The Cheesecake Factory after a work meeting. From the moment we walked in, something was wrong. The woman who greeted us at the counter... well, she didn't greet us at all. She simply said ""how many"" without even looking at us, and didn't say a word nor smile at us as she led us to our table. No wait, but it was a weekday in the mid-afternoon, so that was expected. We got to our table, and we started playing the waiting game. Despite there being very few tables filled, it took ten minutes for our server to even come up to us. Waiting became the theme of our meal. Waiting to get acknowledged, waiting to get water... we never got refills, by the way. While our server was nice enough, it became obvious she was more interested in talking with her server friends instead of dealing with us. We'd look up during the meal and see her chatting with other servers at the register, even though we were waiting for water, waiting for our food to get boxed up, waiting for our check... it was infuriating. Not to mention I had wasted a $10 shopkick gift card on the meal. For those familiar with the program, you know how tough it is to get to the $10 mark.

On the other hand, order to go and prepare to be disappointed.  50% of the time I order to go, my order is incorrect, cold, and normally missing at least one item.  Not sure why but it's always the case.

Sharon S.,"Cupertino, CA",15,20,,1.0,6/21/2016,"First of all the wait is always longer than expected. Here is the most gross thing ever so we were finally seated and given a menu. As we were moving our utensils out of the way my daughter spotted three forks and one knife with old dried food on it.. Now if that doesn't make you want to get up and leave I dont know what would. Old brown sticky stuff on the knife and the three forlks looks like it had old dried rice or some fish on something on them.  I informed our waiter and all he said was sorry I said can you send your manager over here. The manager a lady came over did not introduce herself and said she was sent over here by the waiter and didn't know why. I explained to her the utensils were filthy and unacceptable to eat with. All she said was I will tell the dishwashers  and bring you new ones said sorry and left.     ( cheeezzz thanks)""Unbelievable, with six of us we spent over one hundred and fifty dollars for what filthy forks and a knife. On top of that they brought out three of the six of us meals first the rest of us waited over fifteen minutes to get our food, theirs was already starting to get cold we told them to go ahead and just eat.  Service was terrible we had to ask for bread twice.  None of the wait staff smiled or looked as tho they would rather be some place else. Both the response was like robots oh sorry and left.. Waiter never came back to check on us just to deliver the food. My water was down to ice  I just drank the ice since no one came back to give me more.. Than they expect a huge tip na don't think so didn't do anything to deserve it, Food is not that great and we will not be visiting that location again. If your going to go there let me give you two pieces of advice first just go to Palo Alto location staff is friendly quick and very efficient a more classy place where people are happy and smiling and joking with their customers believe me you will have a much better experience and the utensils will I am sure be very clean.  And second their management staff is so much better there they come by and say hi and ask if everything is ok. Their not like robots at this  other location who say sorry like its a everyday word as hello is. Hope this gives you some insight we work hard for our money and no matter how much we spend going out to eat our Utensils should be clean.

Catherine U.,"Los Altos, CA",77,51,4,1.0,1/22/2016,"My bf and I went to this Cheesecake Factory a little while ago, I have been meaning to leave this review. It was a Friday night and they get super busy, so when we were told 35-35 minutes, we decided to grab ourselves drinks and wait. Their mojitos are very yummy. So a while passes, and our drinks are all gone, but we wait patiently, less so as time goes by. Watching people get seated who came after us, I ask my bf to check on the waiting list. He is kind of shy so what the hell, I do. The hosts look at each other and I just knew they messed up. But they lie and say, oh you're next. Whatever. I'm starving. We get seated outside, which sucks, but again, I'm really hungry at this point. And guess what? More waiting. Eventually, a waitress comes by and asks if anyone has helped us, to which we both answer ""no"". She says no one told her they were seating more people in her section and she was on her way out. Ok. That sucks. But she takes our order anyway. And guess what? More waiting. People whose orders were taken after us received their orders before us. Figures. This is just that kind of night. Worse yet, an employee sat at the table next to us with the same dish my bf ordered. Coincidence? NOPE. The waitress comes by, not a minute later, to tell us someone had taken my bf's dish ""by accident"" and they were making him a fresh one. And for the inconvenience? Here's a free slice of cheesecake. We asked to speak to a manager, who very much seemed like she could care less. She basically nodded, faked sympathy, and asked if we got our free cheesecake. I get it, their business wouldn't suffer at all without our patronage. So be it. I'd rather spend my money at a restaurant that actually cares about guest experience. We've never been back to this Cheesecake Factory location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=220

(My mushrooms were strangely flipped over when baking, the cheese all stuck to the bottom) Sweet Corn Tamale - don't let the 'sweet' fool you, it was tart on top, and sweet where the corn was. the guacamole and sour cream was a nice mix. I forgot which dish I had - it had asparagus and shrimps in it. it was good. The pasta wasn't hard or overcooked. Sauce was light. Do not order the passion fruit tea... it was just straight tea with a hint of fruit. I asked for a second drink, pineapple/orange juice mix... it came back tasting like coconut? Something is wrong here.... Their Ultimate Cheesecake (Red Velvet) was no mas. I don't know if it's popular, but it was all out and none was to be had.  Our waiter did some disappearing act, came when needed but when we wanted time to order to-go he suggested to order 10 minutes before leaving...

J K.,"Edenvale, San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/11/2017,"Meal was fine. Service horrible. We come here a lot and are so disappointed this happened. They took our credit card and when bill came back and we opened to sign, the credit card was missing. When we asked about this they immediately went into defense mode. ""You sure? Did you check your wallet? I'm a 100% sure I put it back in"". This escalated to the manager. She immediately said they train their staff on cc's and asked if I'm accusing her staff of stealing the card. I tried to explain to her that I feel that when we give them our credit card, it is their responsibility until it comes back into our possession. I think she disagrees. My family was there we saw the bill being delivered back to my dad. We saw him open it and we saw there was no card in there. Now after my dad explained the card was missing he had to use the restroom. So after we and the staff walked around the place looking for the card we decided to cancel it. My dad is from out of town and a cancelled card is not good. After all this, a staff member said he found the card in the restroom under some trash. Maybe it dropped out inadvertently and some guest took it got the number and tossed it in the trash. Still a staff member looking in the restroom finding the card under some trash? Nice detective skills. When she found out and I was trying to explain that even if the card fell out by accident and some guest took it it was still their fault. All I got from her and the other male manager looking person was ""we saw your dad use the restroom."" ""It happens to other guests"" apparently they have an epidemic of people dropping cc's in their restroom. I mentioned that my dad used the restroom after the card was discovered and we all saw him open it with card missing. No way he picked up the card, fail to put the card back into his wallet, go to the restroom and throw his card in the trash. From a pure customer service point of view take responsibility and stop blaming the customer for the error. Basically they said that we lost the card and they found it what do we want from them. How bout treating us like human beings? So now my dad is without his card while traveling far from home. Thanks Cheesecake. No way did Manager or that other guy try to de-escalate the situation. All we could do was not tip and pay. I have to admit Cheesecake corporate was very nice and offered a $25 gift card but we won't be eating at Cheesecake anytime soon.

Their food (especially pasta) is always just right and the dessert is mouth watering. I recommend the bistro shrimp or the carbonara! For dessert, I usually ask for chocolate tower cake. It's so big it can be easily split between three people! One huge concern that I have is about my dogs. The servers agreed to let our huge party and two dogs in the outside seating area on a few occasions. They never misbehave and are trained to strictly sit or lay down for the whole meal. However, recently I called and asked (like i do every time) and they refused to let dogs in the patio area. I don't know if they changed the policy, but it was a real let down. I'll probably be coming here a lot less. Also, the workers were usually very nice and attentive, but lately all the service we have gotten includes them walking past, putting the food on the table and continue walking. Not one word spoken.

Our server today was Shannon, who happened to give us the very best A+ service ever!  He anticipated our needs without our ever asking for a refill, when our appetizer was coming, etc. ~ now that's platinum level service.  Scotty is another one whom we had excellent service from as well so make sure you ask to be seated in either one of  these men's stations when you dine here. I decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.  I ordered the Americana Burger, well done and with the clam chowder (it's Friday) instead of the fries or green salad options.  This particular cheeseburger was very juicy, not greasy, for a well done burger.  I could only eat half as it was so large!  I did eat most of the soup. My mother had the Chicken Madeira which came with mashed potatoes.  She said her chicken was full of flavor as was the creamy mashed potatoes.  Noelle J., my daughter, ordered her fave The Factory Burger.  It was ordered well done also.  She noticed that my burger was much larger than hers and a dollar less in price. For dessert, we ordered two cheesecakes: Pumpkin Pecan and the S'mores one.  The Pumpkin Pecan has a pecan pie bottom layer with pumpkin cheesecake on top.  It was very good with both my mother and I enjoying it.  Noelle, being allergic to nuts, could only imagine how good that was.  I introduced Noelle to the S'mores cheesecake earlier in the fall season and she liked it so much, it's her go-to while it's still available.  Currently, the Peppermint Bark cheesecake is the new cheesecake starting this month, as the seasonal offering. As I said earlier, Shannon anticipated our dining needs well.  We had a great time during our lunch as we usually do with the added ""cherry on the top"" of great service by Shannon.  Before we left, we complimented Shannon on his service to us and asked to speak to his manager.  She came by and we related how much we enjoyed the excellent service and if he's not on the training team, he should be!  As it turns out, Shannon is part of the training team for this location. Yes, parking is still horrible here if you don't come early but we avoid that by coming when they first open!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=280

It took 7 minutes to get the server and then 5 more minutes for new fries. The server was nice, but it would have been nice to have my entire meal at once. The vanilla bean cheesecake was good.

Food: - I am a macaroni and cheese lover, and I was not pleased with their mac and cheese. I don't know how to explain it- but the taste and texture was off. You're better off getting the packaged mac and cheese at Safeway. -Sweet Potato Fries- After trying sweet potato fries from The Counter and the Palo Alto Creamery, CF's fries pale in comparison. They are definitely not crispy, and crispiness is crucial in determining if the fries are good or not. -Chicken Alfredo- Honestly, I prefer the Chicken Alfredo from Costco ( the one that's premade for you). With that being said, CF's Chicken alfredo is okay- nothing to rave about.  -Cheesecake- Now, I will say that their cheesecake is really good, but too bad it's pretty expensive. Service: This place is always packed, and I get that it will take some time to get seated. But, I find it ridiculous that people who came in after me were seated before me! If I didn't say anything, then I would have never gotten seated. Now, this happened only once, and remember that I came here many many times.

I remember being traumatized by the Cheesecake Factory because the last time I came here as a kid I ordered orange chicken and it was freaking terrible. But who orders orange chicken at the Cheesecake Factory, amirite? Came here with a bunch of my girlfriends recently and everyone was raving about the Pasta DaVinci so I had to try it out. Most of us shared because the dishes run about $18 and the portions are huge.  The pasta was okay. It probably isn't fair to compare this to Olive Garden, but this dish does not hold a candle to the worst pasta entree at Olive Garden. Maybe I just had high hopes because 90% of my table ordered it. +1 for the cheesecakes, but they didn't exactly blow my mind.

Since my husband knows that I am fan of cheesecake, we decided to dine here. Waiting time on a late afternoon Saturday is around 15-20 minutes.  The ambiance is good. They serve us freshly baked sourdough while waiting for our food. I think it would be great if they can serve this with olive oil and balsamic vinegar not just butter.  We ordered avocado egg rolls for starters. This is so good. 6 freshly made avocado rolls with a very interesting dipping sauce. I love it! For me this is a must have :) The my daughter had cheese pizza. We ordered the big one instead of the child's meal. Well, it was just ok, nothing extravagant. For my hubby, he had Americana burger. This can be shared (for Asians like us, one can't finish the burger alone) I can say, after being here in Bay Area for just half a year only and had tried burgers all over, this is one of the best burgers I had. The burger, the bun, the cheese, the veggies and the secret sauce, love it! We managed to eat half only. I love to bake and red velvet cake is one of my forte. I ordered ultimate red velvet cheesecake and this is sooo good! Highly recommended!  We were served by John and he was really friendly. As usual we were not able to finish our food, we had to go boxes and John packed for us. We had a great meal. We are definitely coming back.

So because of this, I feel obligated to finally write a heart felt honest review.  Alright the menu here is most definitely intimidating. It is literally top to bottom, page after page lists of different appetizers, small plates, salads, and entrees. No joke, I probably have tried everything on the menu and that itself says a lot haha. I recommend the asian chicken salad. It's enough to feed a small village and it's definitely tasty. Or, if you like pasta I really enjoy the garlic noodles here because it's made like a pasta. COMPLETELY different from garlic noodles from yard house and straits which I personally despise. However the crown jewel of this huge restaurant chain is the pick and pair double entree. You can choose  two out of the shrimp scampi, steak Diane, miso salmon and the Parmesan chicken. My favs are the steak Diane paired with the chicken. It's definitely the biggest bang for your buck. I always save 2/3 of the plate for lunch and dinner the day after. Service at this location isn't always the best because they're swamped most of the time. But they are much nicer than their sister restaurant over at valleyfair.

Brandy W.,"San Diego, CA",645,555,118,3.0,5/21/2015,"Wow after yelping for 3 years, it seems my tastes have changed.  I used to love the food from cheesecake factory.  Now, it just tastes subpar. Not being super hungry for their super portions, we opted for tapas on their light menu.  Granted their ""light menu"" has tapas below 500 cal.  When we opt for 4 appetizers to share, that is not exactly light.  We ordered the ahi carpaccio, lettuce wraps, spring rolls, and crab puffs. There were two ahi dishes on the menu, one was double the price of the other.  When I asked the waiter the difference between the two, he had said the amount of ahi varies.  Boy was he being honest.  The cheaper of the two had about 2 spoonfulls of ahi!  They should call it avocado carpaccio with ahi garnish.  I felt bamboozled. The lettuce wraps weren't much better.  More than half of the plate was filled with what I call ""cheap filler food.""  For these wraps that means crispy rice noodles.  Once again, most would consider that garnish or decoration, but it was necessary to add any substance to the lettuce wraps. The spring rolls contained almost all filler food.  Instead of focusing on the shrimp, it had noodles in it... noodles in a wrapper. Not even quality veggies.... just carbs carbs carbs. I think the crab puffs, although my least favorite of all the dishes, had the most substance to it.  Bread crumbs, cream cheese and Krab rolled and deep fried.  Who knows, maybe cheesecake factory was always like that, but no wonder their calorie count is super high. Service was good at this location, except we had to notify the team of a terrible... spill in the restroom.  They didn't seem super concerned about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=260

Alyssa R.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,7,5,1.0,5/3/2016,"BEWARE this restaurant if you have any kind of special dietary needs (food allergies, gluten intolerance, vegetarian, vegan, etc). I went here today with my little one, who has some serious food allergies and gets very sick after eating soy, eggs, or dairy. Since he's breastfed, I have to avoid the same foods he does. I have gotten pretty good at what meals are most likely safe, and chose a meal for both him and me and asked the server to please just double check they'd be safe. He said the only potential issue was mashed potatoes. When the food came out, I was confused that his meal came with the mashed potatoes. I asked the server who brought the food and she said they were indeed made with dairy. We scraped those off and our server apologized and said he'd get us some carrots instead. As I'm eating my meal, I suddenly notice... THEY MADE IT WITH CHEESE. So they messed up BOTH meals that were supposed to be safe. Mind you, I explained this was an allergy issue, and the server said he talked it over with the chef and noted the specific issues. Our server offered to have my meal remade without cheese, but I didn't feel like I could trust their food at that point, so we removed it from the bill. Aside from that, they charged us in full for everything and just said they were sorry for the ""inconvenience."" Yes... I suppose that's one word for my child crying in pain. Hopefully we stopped eating fast enough that he won't be sick. I will never be back and given how badly they messed up, just don't risk it if you have any special dietary circumstances!

Came here last night to meet some friends, as our tradition has been meeting at a Cheesecake Factory in So Cal or Nor Cal. We were seated in the bar area, ironically because my friend had her baby and a stroller. Which was fine with me since it was before 6, and we could still order from the HH menu! Except only problem was our booth reeked of rotten milk/cheese, and it wasn't the baby! The booth was also a bit of a mess too, lots of crumbs near my seat. We were given sourdough bread, my favorite, no wheat, yay! Which was a bit odd though in case if anyone else wanted wheat. I started with a cosmopolitan, which was only $5 during the happy hour. We also ordered 2 appetizers that were $5, the corn tamales and avocado egg rolls. The cosmo was good and strong, and the appetizers came out right away. There were exactly 3 corn tamale cakes for the 3 of us, and they were huge! They were a bit dense, but really good, filled with corn, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, and cilantro that I picked off. It was also dipped in a creamy chipotle sauce, so good, but makes you so full! The avocado egg rolls were packed with avocado, too much for me! It's also accompanied with a cilantro sauce, yucky for me! I pretty much always order the farafelle pasta with chicken, even though it's on the list of worst chicken dishes in a restaurant. I was so full from all the bread, tamale, and egg roll, that I had about 3 bites. It was a bit heavier this time, but I now have 3 meals out of it! My friend got the miso salmon, which is always good, and my other friend didn't really enjoy his ahi tuna. From the looks of it, it didn't look very good.

We requested for water from different waiters several times, even the manager, and did not get any water until we told another waiter about our situation. When we spoke to a manager all he said was ""im so sorry about that, ill be right back"" and he never came back. The lady who was our waitress did not check on us nor look at us after we spoke to the manager. She did not even bother apologizing. Ontop of that she looked at us and actually said ""have u guys been here before?"" I understand waiters ask that question but the way she asked us was not right. After waiting for almost a hour for our food we ended up getting up and leaving. While we were leaving the waitress came up to us and asked us what was wrong and when i told her whats going on and how we wanted to just leave she did not bother saying sorry. She just said okay. We went to the front and asked for the bill for the stuff we had ate which was just 1 appetizer which mind you was served 1) cold 2) with no plates. I suppose they thought we were supposed to eat off the table. The manager did not bother coming back to us, or even apologizing, instead he sent over another waiter, with our bill of $40, including a thai wrap we did not touch, 2 lemonades we did not drink and 1 appetizer that was cold. When we asked the employee why the manager did not personally come and give us the check he said the kitchen is backed up and he is busy there. So, im guessing we were not important enough. We told the employee we will pay for what we ate. He went back and said the manager said its okay you dont have to pay. I felt like i was in a low class restaurant.

Samantha D.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,3,,1.0,4/5/2016,I've had the most horrible experience here tonight. If you are having a large party I do not suggest giving your business to the cheeses casket factory at oakridge mall.   I've been planing for about a week to have a dinner for my 2 year olds birthday. I called 3 days before to see if I could make a reservation since a had a large party and I new accommodation would be tough for a party of our size. I was told no reservations were allowed unless it was during the weekdays the first hour they were open. (In my opinion a horrible rule) but whatever I dealt with it. So I arranged for my mom to get there early which was 530 pm on a Monday (I planned for everyone to arrive at dinner at 730). She put our name on the list. I called and added 3 people at 630 we were told we have to wait an additional hour. ( which we were cool with since I planned dinner at 730) by 8pm my guest who have all arrived were getting hungry and my daughter 2years old had still not been fed. So I finally asked what was taking so long the hostess ( a blond girl sorry didn't get a name) told me it was the guest fault and were taking long with the check. Come to find out it was the servers mistake and messes up the tables bill. The hostess then was totally rude  about me complaining about waiting now 2 hours cause it's 830pm. I was told they only have one table to fit a large party our size 20 . But yet the party we were waiting for was a table of 8. Which I'm sure they gave away our table to. A server then tried to get tough with my uncle who simply asked for a manager and didn't want to speak to anyone who couldn't make decisons. At this time about 845pm I decided to go down to bj's brewery and asked if they could accommodate us not only did they do so they did it with in 5 mins and we had wonderful service and my Daughter finally got to eat her birthday dinner and bj's brew house did a fantastic time job so if your in the oakridge area I'd definitely  recommend bj's over the Cheesecake Factory.

We really should've just gotten up & left, but we waited & waited & waited some more. Thank goodness Angela noticed, apologized for our supposed server & took our order right away. Our supposed server never even came to see us. Our drinks & the basket of bread was dropped off at our table by Angela, but we had no utensils. Then our entrees came out & the server was all ""you guys don't have utensils!"" It's funny that our entrees came out before our appetizer as well & that we had no utensils whatsoever for a long period of time. The food was okay to be honest, I wasn't thrilled with anything at this point.  The only reason it got 2 stars was due to Angela's customer service skills, otherwise this place would get a 1 star.

To conclude our trip, I'd have to say that it was a waste of $130.  I am never coming back to a place that served me raw chicken and then argued that they didn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=320

It came with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and water crest (I think that's what it's called). A unique substitution from your average greens. I must say the sauce was very delicious. It paired really well with the steak and mashed potatoes. I had asked for medium on my steak and it was cooked perfectly at medium. Thank you to the chef! One thing that surprised me was the portion. It was humongous! If you look at the picture, it doesn't do it justice. The place was so big!  My dad ordered the Thai glazed salmon with brown rice. Now we couldn't really tell if it was actually brown rice or what kind of sauce was on the plate because this place has no freaking lights! It was so dark people around me were using the flashlights on their phone to read the menu. Y'all need more lighting in this place! But anyways the Thai glazed salmon was bomb digs. It tasted really healthy and the salmon was flakey and so moist. I would highly recommend!  Oh yes other goods, the bread. I don't know what it's called by the brown bread was my favorite.

Go here on a busy day and time and you can expect it to be busy even if you have a reservation.

Parking here can be pretty hectic and it's set up really weird, there are 2 lanes but it's only one way. I'm sure they did this after testing it out but still pretty weird. Plan for about 10-20ish mins to find parking/walking if you are going on a busy day. As for the food you can't go wrong with the buffalo blasts or the spaghetti.

Charlotte G.,"Freedom, CA",36,33,252,2.0,10/17/2017,"I've only been to The Cheesecake Factory two times.  The first time was over fifteen years ago and it was with my older sister.  Unfortunately my memories of visiting a Cheesecake Factory are not pleasant.  All I remember was the wait to be seated was long but the food was NOT worth the wait.  I recall having ordered a salmon dish that did not taste very good.  I ordered their Miso Salmon.  Unfortunately it was like eating a frozen fish dinner.  It was overly salty and not fresh.  It tasted very processed.  I believe their over seasoning their food is to mask the fact that the food they serve is frozen and not very fresh. Last Christmas my Boyfriend received a $25 gift card for here.  During the Summer we decided to stop by and use the gift card towards a dessert.  Mostly because of my bad experience eating one of their entrees and with the high prices of the items on their menu, $25 just doesn't go very far.  The parking lot was pretty packed which is to be expected because the restaurant is located within a shopping mall.  We were lucky enough to find parking but I can see that parking can be an issue.  Once we arrived at the restaurant we headed straight for the dessert display case.  They had pretty much every kind of cheesecake imaginable.  From your fruit cheesecakes to the more rich chocolate flavors.  I love Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups and decided to order a slice of their Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  It had chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in their original cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and caramel.  It was cloyingly sweet.  Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because it was too sweet!  My Boyfriend ordered a slice of their Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake.  It's their original cheesecake topped with glazed, fresh strawberries.  He seemed to like it.  To give you a perspective of their pricing, a $25 gift card just barely covered the cost of two slices of cheesecake!  We still have like $5 (give or take) left on the gift card.  Unfortunately the desserts were nothing special and we are likely going to never use the remaining balance on that gift card.  There entrees and cheesecakes are pretty and professionally decorated but the flavors do not match their outward appearance.  Buying a cheesecake here is like buying any old frozen cheesecake you can purchase from the frozen food section of a grocery store.  Which is sad considering the word ""cheesecake"" is in their restaurant name, you would expect them to make the best cheesecake in the world!  Unfortunately that is not the case.  The food is dressed up to look pretty and enticing but when you take your first bite, the actual taste is just okay.  I hate to be so blunt but I need to tell the truth for my fellow consumers.  This place is definitely overrated and overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=20

Then my cold steak, broccoli and fries came. Still no appetizer. A server came on and took over shift and said he was going to fix it. Took the steak and brought it back out. The same bone I had cut off was there. He had REHEATed my steak and broccoli. When we suggested that he not do that to other customers he assured us he was trying to get us out as he knew we had waited long. We had already missed our movie... then he came back and gave a terrible snotty attitude when I recommended him giving that option to the guest(of Reheating or fresh) the next time.

Davina P.,"San Jose, CA",638,16,3,4.0,6/20/2017,"Came here for happy hour since a lot of their appetizers are only $5.95 a plate. The whole place was very dimly lit compared to The Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair where they dim the lights towards dinner time.  We sat in the bar area and asked for a happy hour menu even though I've already decided on what I wanted to try before getting here LOL.  While the food looked pretty worth for the happy hour prices I decided paying full price for drinks would be better than the HH drinks they offered.  Drinks -  The Ultimate Margarita ($13.50): I love my margaritas and I for sure loved this one and only needed one throughout HH. Whisky Sour ($11.50): My boyfriend felt like it wasn't strong when he first tasted it so I took a sip. It was well made in my opinion and you can definitely taste the whisky and the orange flavors. It didn't have the bad aftertaste since I normally don't like drinks made with whisky or bourbon. He said he liked the drink overall.  Food -  Avocado Eggrolls ($5.95): While I love avocado and eat guacamole almost religiously, I felt like it was too much avocado in the egg roll itself. The cilantro dipping sauce helped to add an element of sweetness.  Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.95): I've been dying to tried this for the longest time now and I think I might have hyped myself too much. While it was good in itself, it didn't come out piping hot and was too creamy after I got to the second piece of bread that came with it.  Korean Fried Cauliflower ($5.95): My friend who works at Cheesecake Factory told me that it tasted like orange chicken and I've tried fried cauliflower in Utah before so I wanted to try it. While the sweet orange sauce may resemble the orange chicken, the interior not so much. It definitely could have done without the sauce.  Mushroom Burger ($13.95): It was a mountain of mushrooms and even though a bunch fell out, there was even more mushrooms inside the burger. My boyfriend loves his mushroom burger and couldn't even finish it all since it was so ginormous. My eyes were wayyyyy bigger than my stomach because I've had a bit of everything and then got full almost immediately. Maybe it was because I was grazing on the sourdough and whole wheat bread they offered, which was freshly out of the oven and still warm.  Finished my drinks and took the rest of the food to go since I know I'll end up getting hungry later. Happy hour here is definitely best for trying all their appetizers since they're half off. Just wish it wasn't so dark in there all the time. It even got cold in there and I came to escape the heat!  Would come back when I'm craving rich heavy food and another nice Margarita hehe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=60

It is her job to be approachable after all. But everyone else after that was fantastic.  Our server was attentive, cheerful, and quick. So why the three stars? Because the food really isn't worth the cost. Two adults, one child, and our bill was well over a hundred dollars before tip. Yikes!  Now, if the meals were amazing, there would be no grimace here. But let's just say my kid wouldn't touch her Mac and Cheese after two bites because she said it didn't taste like MnC. I had a bite. It definitely didn't taste like it. How can you screw up mac and cheese? Stick to keeping a kid's favorite dish original rather than dressing it up with fancy cheeses. It changes the whole dish.  I had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. I was only able to finish less than a third of it. While it initially tasted good, I started to feel a little sick from how heavy the food was. Tasted like it was cooked in two bars of butter and a pint of heavy cream.  I wish I could take the service of this place and couple it with the food at their Walnut Creek location.

We also had to ask for our bread and for a server to take our order. I'm not sure if there was miscommunication somewhere and maybe our server did not know we were there, but come on. I ordered a steak and it ended up being really salty. My colleague ordered salmon and it was really dry. My other colleague ordered a chicken dish which turned out to be mediocre at best. Usually we love ordering cheesecake at the end of our meal, how are you going to go to Cheesecake Factory and not order a cheesecake!?

I never had a problem with getting a seat. A lot of their appetizers that usually cost $12 and over, you can get for only about $5-6. Their Long Islands and Mojitos are really yummy.(For about $5 dollars each also) I am in love with their Buffalo Blasts, Avocado Rolls, Spring Rolls and Stuffed Mushrooms. I don't really get the hype about the Fried Macaronis.  Now if I wanted a plate, I would get the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which is seafood drenched in cream sauce with a hint of lemon (that I really enjoy). Oh did I mention the bread basket? It's soft, addicting and is somewhat on the sweet side. We always have to control ourselves from asking the waiter for more and not get stuffed before our food arrives. The Pineapple Mojito on their regular menu is also a must try.  My only complaint is that one of the waiters in this particular CF is a little preoccupied and out of himself. He would forget orders occasionally, wouldn't check on us unless he was serving food or our bill came and there was this one time where we stated that we preferred the brown bread over the white bread, and he instantly just grabbed the white bread from the basket with his hands.

Al B.,"San Jose, CA",8,156,287,5.0,6/21/2015,"SECOND VISIT So I decided to come back here after a long hiatus for a late night cheesecake run.  The wait time was around 15-20 minutes due to the holiday weekend but that wasn't too much of an issue. Our order consisted of Riesling White Wine, quesadilla appetizer, and a red velvet cheesecake. Let me do a brief a review of each: Riesling White Wine: It was good but a tad bit bitter on the after taste. I liked the sweet aroma initially so that was enjoyable. Quesadilla Appetizer: The quesadilla was really good! Compared to your typical quesadilla, there is guac, salsa, sour cream, and peppers included, which all made it great! I only wish there were more to devour. Red Velvet Cheesecake: This cheesecake was the star of the night. We LOVED it! The portions of cheesecake to red velvet cake was just right and it was absolutely sweet! I liked it but she thought it was slightly too sweet. Decor and presentation was great as usual, which all made our appreciation of this decadent dessert even better. Overall, I had another good experience here. I would definitely come back for more if the occasion arises!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=160
Carmen R.,"San Jose, CA",2,39,8,1.0,12/3/2016,"3 stars, huh!!!!!??? Hopefully this review will bring it down to 2.  My sister had this bright idea to have her birthday dinner at the cheesecake factory, and why not their cheesecake is divine. If this review was for the cheesecake I would have given it 5 stars, buuuut unfortunately it's not. It's for customer service. And as everyone knows I'm a big fan of customer service.  We came in with a party of 12 adults and 4 kids. And having 4 kids in the party we knew to have them fed and napped which we did. However, the hostess here had a different plan. After arriving 30 minutes prior to our planned time we were told we'd have to wait about an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes. Ok fine. Most of our tables are ready at about the 40 minute mark. However, these two ladies (who were holding up our whole dinner party) just simply couldn't s-t-h-u. After about an hour and a half the hostess decided chatty kathy and chatty nancy weren't going to be leaving any time soon so they sat us down...right next to them. And the two mentioned above were STILL talking. Which is fine and all, but people please be considerate of your surroundings, I know kindness, and manners are a thing of the past, but common courtesy, I thought, was still in circulation.  So we're finally seated, and jabber jaws are still at it.  We meet Nate, our server and he really tries to remedy the situation but, he got me past my hunger point. Hangry is never a good place for me to be. So in all fairness I'll give him a shot. He did his best but it still didn't help the situation.  Chapter 3: so after we're seated they offer us one complimentary appetizer for the 16 of us. Which takes forever to come out. And when it does it's lukewarm. We order our drinks. Which also take a while to come out. I think that was because our sodas and waters were made fresh.  On to the food the only thing worse than the service, believe it or not. My niece and nephew ordered the alfredo pasta who are only 3 and 5 and they didn't even eat it. It was completely flavorless. Mind you I have yet to see these kids turn down a meal. They ate from everyone else's plate so they were fine. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced.   This was my second time here in about 5 years and it's definitely my last. Unless of course I wanted the chocolate Godiva cheesecake. Then maybe I'll return...MAYBE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=100
Conner H.,"San Jose, CA",10,20,12,1.0,11/6/2017,Horrible experience. So we arrive at 5pm and put our name on the list. They quoted us an hour and a half wait time for a party of 13. Sure that's fine it's early by the time we would've gotten our table so we decile we will walk around the mall and shop. An hour goes by and we all gather back and decide to wait out the rest of the half hour. It hits the last half hour mark of the wait time. Still table isn't ready they say they're cleaning it. 15 minutes pass. Still the table isn't ready they're still cleaning it. Another 15 pass and they say they're preparing it. Another 10 minutes pass and they say that they're waiting for the other half of the table to leave. So this whole time you lied about the table being cleaned/ready/prepared?? By now it's been over 2 hours wait time and counting. Everyone is very upset because it's already getting late and everyone is hungry. Not to mention it would take another 15 minutes to order and another 45 or more to prepare all the orders. And of course coming with so many orders they leave out some plates and they get cold or under cooked etc (has happened plenty of times before) and of course the manager was no help at all. Will not be returning to this location. You're better off at BJs or Olive Garden. CF quote you a time. But they don't live up to it unless it's small parties. I am sure they gave our tables away and thought they could squeeze as many customers in between the wait time as possible. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE and a huge waste of time. I wouldn't recommend coming here at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=100
Mike A.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,1,2.0,4/16/2017,"Worst experience ever! I have been coming to this location for years and today may be my last.  I ordered French toast. After waiting 30 minutes my family got their food and at that time I was told that they ran out of french toast. The manager, Lindsey, told me to order whatever I wanted and she would get it to me quickly. I asked for a waffle.  I waited another 30 minutes. My family finished eating. I asked what was taking so long. Lindsey said the waffle iron was no working right. She never came back to inform me of that. I had to look for her to ask why it was taking so long. She did.not have the common courtesy to tell me. I was frustrated and ended up not ordering any food for myself.  I understand that restaurants get busy.

Sweeny Y.,"San Jose, CA",81,82,53,3.0,5/28/2016,"Usually when I dine at the cheesecake factory in Oakridge I have a good experience. Last night, my mother and I went there to celebrate a work promotion (yay me! But anyways...). We decided to share Avocado egg rolls and an Alfredo pasta. I also ordered a tequila sunrise, in which the waiter asked ME what was in it (wtf write it down and ask your bartender).  First of all, it took days for our food to come out. We waited 30 minutes and our appetizer still wasn't out. He finally brought it out, but we kinda expected our pasta to be out at the same time since it took so damn long (this was when the tequila was wearing off, so I was getting very annoyed lol).  Finally, our pasta came out and it was so MEH. It just tasted like a wet noodle. No salt, no seasoning, nada. I told our waitor after 2 bites that this is not an Alfredo and he quickly apologized and gave us a choice of another pasta. It tasted wayyyy better than what we originally ordered. I'm giving them a 3 star because they handled the situation pretty well. The manager came out (I think his name was Dave or David?) And he said since it would take another 15 minutes for the pasta to be ready, he offered us a complimentary soup or salad which totally helped us keep our hungar down. Our waiter apologized several times and I think genuinely felt bad.  I've had better experiences at the cheesecake in Oakridge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=100

Couldn't hunt down our waiter for the check and when we finally did, there was no one to take it. After a grueling time waiting, we decided to rummage up whatever cash we had in the bottom of our bags so we could just leave it on the table and get out of there. Other than the poor service, I always love myself some avocado egg rolls and $5.50 during HH is definitely worth the crispy avocado goodness. The bread we were given was extremely cold and that was disappointing because one of the best things about restaurants is looking forward to that basket of warm bread. We also ordered the crab and artichoke dip and it seemed good at first then we realized they faced all the burnt sides of the bread down.

We went here on a Friday night (I know, what a dumb idea) but it's b/c we didn't want to drive far. The wait here is always crazyyyy. We decided to sit outside because the wait was much shorter. Also, it's much more chill (literally) outside versus sitting in a noisy & dim lighted inside setting. Sitting outside is not so bad b/c they have those warm fire lights thing so it keep us warm. The menu is extensive & is on the pricier side. The food was ok, nothing to rave about. I ordered the mac & cheese burger. It was meh, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It didn't ""wow"" me. My 3 friends ordered: 4 cheese pasta, spicy chicken chipotle pasta, & lemon-herb roasted chicken. Halfway through eating, the waiter brought out another dish & said they gave her the wrong chicken dish.... UHH, luckily she didn't have any allergies or that'd be all bad.

How many times have I been to cheesecake factory? More than a dozen. So imagine my disappointment when I spent 17.37 cents on two slices of cheesecake and realize (when I get home) that one slice is totally normal sized and delicious looking, and the other slice (the banana) was thin and small. I didn't bother checking the bag when the woman, who was very nice by the way, handed it to me. I just put it in my car and went home. I was so excited to eat it but it ended up being like less than half the size of the red velvet. What the heck man?? They usually cut all the slices so evenly and they are a pretty OK portion for around 8 dollars each. I am so sad that I wasted my money on such a tiny slice of cheesecake. My BF finished it in less than three bites, I kid you not. Next time I will look in the bag first!!

The manager said it was almost done but another manager later said they were barely starting to cook her chicken. The waitress was indifferent and I never got a refill & forgot to split my check. They compt the  chicken and it arrived with her 200.00 check.

I ended up ordering a Cobb salad.  I mean how can you screw that up right? I've had better cobb salads at hole in the wall diners! Zero flavor! Mostly all lettuce, with tiny pieces of all the other goodies. The lettuce also looked slightly wilted, as if it was preassembled earlier in the day.  Lucky for me we had a really sweet waiter who quickly brought me herb crusted salmon that was really good. He saved the night!

Suzy G.,"Nipomo, CA",51,334,466,3.0,4/20/2014,"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory.  You ever see that Spongebob episode where the Krusty Krab is sold to a corporate chain and re-branded ""Krabby O'Monday's?""  Well, I'm sure you can imagine it.  I avoid chains like that and don't normally even think of them as ""food.""  But this was a family thing and I was swept along with the herd. I was absolutely amazed at the number of different options on their multi-page menu.  Of course, they don't have 50 different sous chefs hand-prepping each sauce.  More like 20 different food preppers pulling required sauces from the freezer.  But that being said... To my surprise, the food was very tasty!  I always love combo options so I had the Steak Diane w/ Herb-Crusted Salmon.  Everyone was very happy with their plates. The operative word here is, ""factory"" and they operate with factory precision.  An amazing number of people are squeezed in and successfully fed a surprisingly large variety of food options.  So I'd say that, for what they are, they're good at it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=300
A. S. J.,"San Jose, CA",72,23,7,1.0,10/17/2016,"This review is for their pick-up/curbside service. 1) I called to place my order. Someone picked up and asked if it was ok to place me on hold. As if I had a choice. Waited 15 mins before anyone picked up the line and finally took my order. They said it would take 15-20 mins. 2) parked in the 10 minute parking for curbside to go and called the number posted on the sign. Whoever picked up must have been on a satellite phone in another country because the static was ridiculous, not to mention she was talking a mile a minute. I said ""Hi, I'm calling from curbside parking to pick up my order?"" to which she gave a response so sloppy and fast that I couldn't even make out what she said. I thought maybe she asked for my name so they could get my order ready to bring out but before I could say anything I was yet again placed on hold. 3) Now another 13 mins on hold and no one has picked up the line, I decide to make another call from my phone to the same number. The same person picked up and I told her what the deal was and did she give any type of apology??? NO. She just said ""uh yea, what's your name again?"" AGAIN??? As if she had got it the first time. I told her and she asked what type of car I was in. I told her and she said she would tell them right now. 4) it has now been another 15 mins and I see door dash people coming and going left and right into this place. Why is it that they are getting better service than their direct customers who make the trip to come to their restaurant for their order? I would have gotten out of the car but I had my 3 young kids with me, including a baby. My 6 year old is now complaining as we have been in the car for a total of 40 mins to pick up one order which is comprised of one entree and one salad. Completely insane.

The decor is over the top and beautiful, Vegas like. The service is usually wonderful.. Except for the front lobby people. I can't stand the lack of professionalism and unorganized madness on a busy night.

When I come here I always feel like it's where the ghetto comes to feel fancy or where high school kids bring their dates. The menu is extensive but nothing ever sticks out as a must-have. I always end up ordering from their appetizer menu because those dishes sound and taste better than their entrees. Personal favorites are the Asian Lettuce Chicken Tacos and the samosas. Also the fried chicken sliders. Cheesecake is their specialty so their cheesecake menu is extensive and all of the kinds I've had are very good.

Reena P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",117,231,79,1.0,5/4/2014,"Why is there terrible customer service at 10 pm and 50% capacity? Came here late on a Friday night. We waited about 10 minutes and were seated in the bar area. Our server plopped us down with no pleasantries and gave us our menus. When she came back to get our drink orders we didn't even have water or bread. We had to ask for water and then proceeded to order when she finally came back the next time.  Our order consisted of one diet coke, edamame and fire roasted chile rellenos. The chile rellenos came first and it was pretty good. The edamame proceeded and was plopped down by our server.  As the plopping occurred she said, 'soy sauce.' We said, 'huh?' Again, she said, 'soy sauce' and we said, 'huh.' After the second 'soy sauce' we realized she was asking if we wanted some with our edamame. She wasn't very pleasant and seemed to be having a bad day. Would it have killed her to say, 'Would you like some soy sauce?' At least we would've been able to understand her.... nonetheless we said yes.  Fast forward 10 minutes and the edamame was almost gone and we still didn't have any soy sauce. We kept seeing her walk by but couldn't get her attention even if our life depended on it. Eventually we wrangled her to our table and got our soy sauce.  Once we were done eating I wanted to order cheesecake, but was dreading having to track her down for a menu. We got another server to bring us the menu and then we got yet another server to take our order. In all that time, our server NEVER came to our table to see how our meal was or to ask if we wanted dessert! Overall, terrible customer service. It seems as though they have too many people working at the restaurant because instead of providing excellent, or even mediocre, service they have time to socialize/flirt with each other. Managers need to step up and make sure their employees are meeting expectations.   CUSTOMERS COME BACK FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WILL PASS ON A PLACE IF THE FOOD IS GOOD BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=360

Boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits before and told me it was HUGE and a whopping 2000 calorie dish! better share that. and boy he was right. it came fresh and hot. Chicken was very tender and the biscuits were soft and warn, vegetables were tasty, and the gravy was creamy and delicious. We shared it, and we STILL had leftovers!

Yadira H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Went to dinner last night and was told it was a 30 min wait for a party of 2, got a pager and just stood right by the host table to wait. After 45 mins had gone by I asked the host how much longer only for him to say that ""they had already buzzed the pager for me by they would put me at the top of the list"" OUR PAGER NEVER BUZZED so we had to wait another 10 minutes, when we finally got seated the hostess gave us an attitude. At first we had a male server who seemed nice and we didn't want to take our frustration out on him so we gave him a chance, he got us drinks took our meal order, we waiting 40 minutes for the food to come out ONLY FOR IT TO BE THE WRONG FOOD!!!! we told them that's not what we had ordered and he came to the table to apologize and ask what we wanted to eat, it took another 20 minutes for the right food to come out. Then a server named Brooke came over to tell us she was our server but she had been on break, we finished eating and she came over to ask if we needed boxes, we said no, she left and took 15+ mins to come over to ask if we wanted the check we said yes and she took 10 mins to bring it, we put our credit card in before she left yet she still walked away and took over 10 mins more to come back and grab the card.

Andrea G.,"San Francisco, CA",265,236,498,4.0,8/2/2013,"I love that Cheesecake Factory has half off cheesecakes on July 30th every year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day. Which was exactly why I was there the other night.  The wait was relatively long. When we arrived, the estimated time for seating was about 40 minutes so we stood around the lobby area trying to decide beforehand what cheesecake we'd want to try. Once we sat down at the table, our server came to take our order and to let us know that it was very hectic in the bakery so our cheesecakes would take longer than usual to get to us. We decided to order two appetizers to start: the parmesan polenta fries and warm crab and artichoke dip. Both were delicious.  The parmesan polenta fries appear at first to look like mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce. The outside is a golden brown crispy breading. The inside is soft, a contrast to the crunchy breading. I really thought this was a very good appetizer. Not too filling, which is perfect as a starter. The warm crab and artichoke dip was very delicious. It came with a side of toasted bread. The dip was warm and creamy and you can taste the chunks of crab and artichoke. I would definitely order this again. We wanted to save room for our cheesecake so we didn't order any entrees this time. I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which has chocolate cake, brownie, and toasted coconut pecan frosting. I love chocolate so the chocolate cake and the chewy brownie was perfect for me. And I do like coconut too, but tonight, I felt that the coconut was too overpowering in taste that it overwhelmed everything else in the cake. I felt that the coconut stood out a lot more than any other part of the cake. So if you really like a strong coconut flavor, this is the cake to order. I also had a bite of the Snicker's cheesecake and if you're a fan of Snicker's bar, this is the perfect dessert to get. I had a taste of Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake and I loved it. Half carrot cake, half cheesecake mixed together, what isn't there to love? And I also had a bite of the vanilla bean. It tasted exactly like how vanilla bean ice cream tastes like. It's plain compared to most of their other cheesecake but still delicious. Service was a little slow the night we went. But considering that many people probably went for the half off cheesecake, I can understand why. The restaurant was packed and while I was waiting in the lobby to be seated, I could see the people working in the bakery section running around trying to fulfill all the orders. Loved the food we ordered. I'll be returning again soon. And I'll for sure return next year for National Cheesecake day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=340
Andy H.,"Anaheim, CA",62,296,356,1.0,12/19/2015,"I love so many dishes and cheesecakes that Cheesecake Factory has to offer, so I come here pretty often. However, the last few times that I've came to this location I've had unpleasant experiences. A little over a month ago our late night server decided to close our check out and not give us the opportunity to order refills on our cocktails prior to the bar closing. Same thing with dessert, which really devastated us since that's one of the main reasons why we come here. We were not given a heads up that the registers where the cheesecakes are at, were being closed down. The server didn't apologize or seem to care when we brought up our concern. Our party left very unhappy, but we decided to overlook it and we ended up coming back 2 weeks later. During this visit, we checked in with the hostess for a party of 4. We were told it would only be 10 to 15 mins. Eventually 30 mins went by and we noticed that groups both larger and smaller, that came after us were being seated. As soon as we asked the hostess why we hadn't been seated and why others that came after we're seated, we were then walked over to our table. I am not sure how we were skipped since we had a ""pager"", but we were just glad to finally be seated. Now during our most recent experience last night, we left unsatisfied. The food for each person of our party of 4 came out at different times, with at least 5 to 10 mins gaps in between each meal being brought out. Which we found strange since it was later in the evening when the restaurant was slow. Everyone's food was either cold or luke warm. The mashed potatoes were so salty we could not eat them. The server was very apologetic and sweet and offered to rectify the issue. The manager came out to apologize and gave us some cheesecakes on the house due to our unpleasant experiences. We got our cheesecakes to go and asked for my cheesecake to be bagged individually, since I don't live with the 3 other people in my party. I took the bag home that I was told contained my cheesecake and put it in the fridge. Today when I got home from work, I was ready to eat my cheesecake just today find out that the server bagged the left over pasta from someone else in my party, instead of my cheesecake. I am beyond frustrated. Bottom line is, none of these issues should have occurred and there is no explanation to them. These last few visits have left a bad taste in our mouth and we definitely will not be returning to this location even though it is much more convenient for us. We will start going back to Valley Fair. After reading all the other bad reviews, I am confident this is the best choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=340

Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",55,62,20,4.0,11/15/2013,"This would be my 4th Cheesecake Factory that I've been to. Its not nearly as packed and rowdy as the one in Honolulu or in San Diego, but still fills up later in the evening.   Service: I went for my birthday, knowing that they didn't take reservations, and had to wait to find out how long the wait would be for a party of 9. With this in mind, the manager was very speedy to get me a table, took about a 30 min wait overall which wasn't bad. The waiter was very amiable and pretty patient knowing that my party was trickling in (very slowly due to parking at the mall) and kept a pretty watchful eye on my drinks.  Food: What can I say, Cheesecake Factory always delivers on this. It took a while for the food to come out, and it was a little disappointing considering it wasn't fully packed. other than that though, I got my bday wish + a corny song when my pumpkin pecan cheesecake came out. It was great. Price: Be prepared to spend some bills if you are going to have a dinner with a few people.

Courtney S.,"San Jose, CA",12,8,,1.0,3/6/2016,"To sum up my overall experience, only one word comes to mind; HORRIBLE. My fiancé and I only have one night off a week, and we decided to take our night to our local Cheesecake Factory. Being that it was a Saturday night, we knew there was going to be a wait. We were quoted an hour. When we returned, we were told another 20 minutes. 20 minutes later, another 10 minutes. The gentleman at the host stand was less than understanding of our frustration. When we asked him if we had a booth or a table, He rudely responded with ""You have a table"" I asked if it was in the middle of a groups and once again rudely responded ""Your up against a wall"" I made a comment about waiting for a booth and he said it would be a long wait but when I mentioned that I didn't want to wait after the 30 minutes of runarounds a booth happened to open up. Once seated, our server (the only pleasant part of our visit) came by, took our drink and meal orders. I noticed that my spoon looked a little dirty so I handed it off to her, ""This is a little dirty, but I don't need it so its ok."" After noticing my spoon, I took a closer look at the other utensils and noticed ALL BUT ONE were dirty. I asked for the manager and explained to her how unsettling it was that nearly all of the silverware on our table happened to be dirty. I didn't feel comfortable putting those utensils on my food or in my mouth even. Once I got my drink and felt the etching on the glass, I was startled thinking that the glass was dirty too. The manager tried to tell me that one of the knives was only water stains and I kindly asked if she would run her finger along the knife to feel the grime that I felt. Her facial expression changed. She did assure me that she would be speaking to the dishwashers to make sure that this issue was corrected. To finish off my night, I'd like to move on to our meal. My fiancé ordered a burger, and I ordered off the small plates menu, Ahi Tartar and a side of edamame as my meal. My fiancé's meal came out first, our server said she would be right back while she checked on my food. While she was gone, another server came to drop off my edamame and to inform me that they had ran out of the Ahi Tartar. At this point I was LIVID. Was this not an issue that could have been addressed before our food was dropped? So I would have had a chance to order something and not have to WAIT? The server who dropped our food off told the manager who was on her way to address the mess up that I was clearly upset. So she asked me ""Would you like another appetizer?"" Perhaps she didn't know that was my meal? I did decline because my fiancé already had his food, I didn't want his food to get cold while he waited for me to get served, and at that point I was too upset to eat. Once we asked for our check, no manager stopped by to make right by the situation, the server just said that they comped the $5 edamame. I did not mention that the host in the beginning was rude to us, because I wanted to move past that and enjoy my dinner........ but that didn't happen.

Satnam B.,"San Jose, CA",122,502,251,3.0,4/4/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake factory for the first time with the wife the other day. This is located in Oakridge Mall past the food court towards Target. I was really impressed with the decor, atmosphere and friendly staff. You need to walk towards the cakes and cheesecake counter if you come in on the mall side and register how many guests. I decided to ask at the counter if there cheesecakes all had eggs, and the attendant did not have an ingredient or allergen chart but said I think so, not good, they should know their ingredients. I wish they made a cheesecake without eggs. Had a short 5 min wait to be seated at a booth. Decided to order fried zucchini and portobello mushroom fries and asked for ketchup vs the dips. Tasted really good! There whole wheat bread and butter also was delectable, I did not like the white bread at all.  I went through the menu and decided on a large veggie burger and fries, boy was the burger big and it tasted really good. My wife went with a pasta dish and she liked it. The staff checked on us often and topped up our waters, asked if everything was ok and was willing to bring more bread.  It was a really nice experience, then came the bill, $33 for lunch for two! Woah, little pricey if you are looking to fill up, 3 stars, if prices were lower for specials would have given it 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=400
Charlene P.,"San Jose, CA",42,149,197,4.0,3/7/2014,"The biggest downside I have with this place is that no matter what day and time we come here, there's always a 30 minute + wait. I recently just went on 2/8/2014 and had to wait an hour. -__________- Granted it was a Saturday evening, but still are they understaffed or something? They always seem to be moving so slow! As for the food, my favorite dish by far is the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with chipotle mayo. The meat is so moist and tender and overall yummy! Never get their side salad though. It's so gross and bitter...then again I'm the type of person who likes the plain old Caesar Salad. To each their own. You might enjoy it. Aside from this entrée, their burger is eh--nothing spectacular. I'd rather go to Red Robin or BJs next door if I wanted a good burger. I enjoy the low lighting and atmosphere of this place, but it does tend to get really loud. It's conveniently placed in a mall where we can roam around before or after our meal.  More often then not, I come here for the cheesecake. Granted it's not the best and smoothest cheesecake I've ever had--it's still pretty good. I especially adore their Red Velvet. But I know people who enjoy their Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake and their Mud Pie.  Another complaint I have though is that their Orange Chicken seems to be hit or miss every time we order it. The very last time we received it, it was nice and moist and covered with sauce. But a couple times before that, they came out pretty dry. AND it's a $17 dish which I think is kind of ridiculous considering all they give you is about ten pieces of chicken and a portion of white rice.  PLUS SIDE. Their Oreo Milkshake is sooooo good. They always blend it nice and thick compared to Red Robin's which can be runny at times.

It had an Asian sauce that went very well with the chicken. There was a caramel sauce that was drizzled on top of the chicken that made it have an amazing flavor. The caramel on the outside made it sweet and crunchy. There was rice served with the chicken that also went well with the chicken. If you go here you should give this dish a try. Dessert: The cheesecake that they serve there is the best. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake and it is to die for. The cake was very moist. The cream cheese in the middle was sweet and creamy.

I ordered curbside delivery 9/26/14 but even after asking for the gentleman who took my order to give my order back to me which was easy (two grilled cheese sandwiches and one order of spicy cashew chicken and 4 slices of cheesecake.) Obviously this was more of a order for the little ones in my home sitting hungry. The guy who took my order said it would take 30-40mins to be ready. My reply ""no rush I'm not close take your time"" his reply ""thank you ma'am."" After 45 mins go by my husband leaves to go get food, comes home then notices the one none kid order was wrong (no spicy cashew chicken) yay, NOT! So now we have to go back out to tell them they screwed up.  My husband arrived went to the checkout line waiting 10mins then walked to the maître d'and asked what to do since we have a meal we didn't order and it's now 2 hours in since ordered (even though I called ahead.) They pointed to the line my husband just exited to ask for help.....but now must re-enter and wait yet another 15 mins to get our original meal order.  Did they say sorry? Did they offer a discount? Anything? NOPE! Instead an evening of my family running back and forth at this restaurant. Complete waste of the night. Yes we got our chicken dish, but at the cost of time and gas it took it was a total waste.  Completely disappointed in the lack of any customer service.

I like that it's super close to home and convenient if we're going to see a movie at the cinema next door or happen to be shopping... and their dessert menu (as is the case with the entire chain) is pretty delicious. The entrees at ALL locations are pretty nasty and overpriced, so unless you are on a mission to waste money or see how many calories you can consume in one sitting, I'd avoid them entirely and stick to appetizers/drinks/dessert. This location specifically has a few negatives that are worth pointing out: 1. Less clean than your average mall restaurant. The tables and menus are almost always sticky. Gross. 2. Service generally blows. There are lots of frazzled employees who always seem to either be new trainees or folks who just don't give a sh#t unless they deem you a big tipper. For instance, if you let your waitress know in advance that you're not there for an entree (appetizer/drink/dessert only), they will treat you like an annoyance from that point forward. This tends to mean not bringing any bread out, forgetting drink orders entirely and rushing you out with a check before you've received all your food. 3. It's LOUD. OH SO LOUD. That is expected with most chain restaurants, and especially those located in a mall, but it's still annoying.

Parties of 6 and 7 people got their table before us.  15 minutes later, we approach them and ask for our table. THEN we get our table. Sooo it took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to get our table when we were told it was going to be a 30  minute wait, and in between the 30 minutes and the 1.15 hours, they told us that it would 'just be a couple more minutes'. Thanks.. Our waiter was a very very quiet young guy. We're a party of 8 for crying out loud. SPEAK UP!!! We didn't even hear him ask us if we wanted bread. He is taking our order when my friend asks for a Sprite. So he goes to put it in the computer. Then..he leaves. For 5 minutes. UH... WHAT? You were in the middle of taking our order!! WHY THE HELL DID YOU LEAVE??? So he comes back like it was NO BIG DEAL and continues to finish our order. Oh yeah, and my friend didn't even get his Sprite till 20 minutes through the dinner. It was hard to find him throughout the night. And when we ordered cheesecake, we asked for 1 additional minute. ONE. MINUTE. And he leaves, and comes back 15 minutes later. Uh.............. Thanks for giving us 14 additional minutes.... Sorry for the 12 dollar tip. But, I couldn't bring myself to give more. Maybe next time, when there's better service. Food was great, though. Loved the fettuccine alfredo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=480
Dee P.,"San Jose, CA",61,51,,2.0,2/24/2013,"I went to this location on Fed. 15th with my half sister.  We received EXCELLENT service from one waitress. I don't remember her name, but she was tall, thin, and possibly Caucasian. She wore a Loony Tunes tie. She was awesome! She suggested healthy food options, gave a very motivational talk with my sister who was trying to diet and lose weight, she was very patient with me in helping me choose the perfect cheese cake... she was great!  HOWEVER, here's when the bad comes. The awesome waitress was off work when we got there so, then that's when she was replaced by waitress number 2. She was a overweight chick with a bad attitude. She didn't check on us ONCE, didn't fill our drinks, didn't do nothing!  Our first waitress was so wonderful we wanted to give her a $20 tip. However, we decided to leave no tip in fear that the heavier waitress would take it. She really didn't deserve it and wasn't good at all. She got an attitude with us when we canceled our cheese cake orders. She was just... bad.  The food was pretty good. I enjoyed it enough to go back.  Oh and awkward moment: I told my half sister I thought one of the waiters was extremely cute. My half sister (who had one too many glasses of wine) randomly told the waiter I thought he was cute.

Star S.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,,1.0,5/19/2014,"Wow. Never have I ever looked at Cheesecake Factory in a negative light until I recently ordered something for pick up today.  It was irritating to be put on hold and forgotten for 7 minutes when I called to place the order and had to recall. But I let it go because it happens. But when I showed up to pick up my order I walked up to the Bakery and pick up counter and there was a man working there that was busy, turned around, looked at me and turned and continued what he was doing. Not a hello. Nothing. Okay. So then another man came over, light purple button up looking like he's a ""supervisor"" looked at me, and continued on WHILE talking to his coworker. THEN a female came along, did the same thing. All three completely ignored me. I was stunned. So at this point, I stood there stunned while a larger man with a ponytail and beard came over and asked me if anyone had asked me if I needed help.Thank you Jesus! I'm not dead after all! I was starting to feel like Patrick Swayze in friggn Ghost dude. I looked at the two men while I replied ""No, I""m waiting to pick up an order"" so then this bearded dude says ""I'm sorry, they are boxing your order right now"" and I say thank you. Then I overheard him telling the guy to say hello to customers or something like that, it was hushed, and I heard the dude say ""I did""....so Mr. bearded ponytail man, you're employing a liar. You should know. Through his damn teeth.  Now...unless the person boxing my food was creating a box out of organic recycled material himself back there, there's no way it was ""being boxed"" because I sat and waited for a half hour. Keep in mind I have a half hour lunch break. I called at 12:15 pm and was told it would be ready in 15-20 min. So I show up at 12:35. Long story short, I sit, wait, Mr. Purple shirt ""manager"" looks at me a few times, no one says a damn thing. People come and go. Life moved along. FINALLY about 2 seconds before I'm about to leave without my food or paying because I am..SO pissed,, a boy comes out with two to-go bags, rings up like the third person before me and doesn't say I darn thing. Really? Okay I will walk over and ask. Sure as hell my order is chillin there. I literally had to say ""is that mine?"" to get my stuff. My lukewarm, 45 minute, insanely not worth it, stuff. DO NOT tell a client that something is being ""boxed up"" if its barely being thrown in a pan. I would rather hear ""Hey we're sorry, it's gonna be a little longer""or whatever.

Prices range from 6 dollars to around 8 dollars. I KNOW its expensive but trust me, the fatty cheesecake and creamy goodness is sooo worth it.  As for the restaurant itself, it is very dark. Also, it will take you forever to get seated. This restaurant, particularly at night is border line OMG I can't see!  After you do manage to get a table (expect a 1 hr wait on weekday nights and over 2 hours for weekends), you will get seated.

The portions here are huge! I frequently get the pasta to share with a friend. Trust me, spitting the calories will make you feel less guilty afterwards.  The food in my opinion is just ok, there isn't anything special. The only thing that makes Cheesecake Factory worth going for is the Cheesecake. This place lives up to its name so if you haven't tried the cheesecake, order a slice togo! My favorites are 30th anniversary, tirumisu, pineapple upside down, and godiva chocolate.

It was a normal Friday night crowd and we sat down after 15 minutes of waiting. The waiter took about 5 minutes to come take our drink order (that's normal. We were totally fine with that). But then.....nothing. He dropped off my beer and their 2 sodas AS HE WAS PASSING! He literally dropped them off and kept walking. After that, we didn't see him again. Not once.

Noelle W. (Thoughts on Cheesecake Factory). I come to this particular Cheesecake Factory 3-4 times a month with family and friends because of the endless allergy friendly selections. They have a new GM and the staff seems to be more efficient. I absolutely LOVE and I mean LOVE the Sunday Brunch selections. My favorite Sunday Brunch selection is the french toast with whipped cream and chocolate; they also make to die for bacon. My favorite dishes are: 1. Old Fashioned Burger which is on a Toasted Brioche Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickles and Mayonnaise. Served with Fries. (Its Charbroiled) and I usually get it protein style. 2. The Factory Burger (Its Charbroiled) with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions. I normally get this on a baguette w/ bleu cheese sans the cheddar and tomato.  3. Chicken Salad Sandwich- Housemade with Roasted Almonds, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo. Served on Grilled Brioche Bread. Sans the almonds of course. 4. Shepherd's  Pie- Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious Sauce Covered with Mashed Potatoes and Parmesan Cheese. This is a great savory and hearty dish. A group of our friends were going to meet up for dinner and a movie. It turned out that only two people could make it that one night! Though the restaurant was full (meaning people seated and dining) there was no wait at all. Service from start to finish was seamless and friendly. Our waiter was going on a break, and in standard Cheesecake Factory procedure they introduce the person who will be helping out. My friend had the chicken tacos and I had the original hamburger. Food was fresh, tasty and allergy friendly. For dessert my friend had the lemon raspberry cheesecake and I opted for the original with cherry topping.  My friend treated for dinner and it was agreed that next time I'll pick up the tab. I've been to Cheesecake Factories in California (Northern and Southern) and Washington- its a good chain restaurant which can satisfy even the pickiest eater! On another note- they did bring back the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake but its different; instead of topping it with whole pineapple rings they top it with a pineapple puree (probably more cost effective). Favorite Sweets: Lemoncello Cream Torte Layers of Vanilla Cake and Lemon Mascarpone Cream Topped with Streusel and Served with Strawberries and Whipped Cream. Tiramisu  Italian Custard Made with Mascarpone, Whipped Cream, Lady Fingers, Marsala and Coffee Liqueur.

Well just say Cheesecake Factory and watch your friend's heads nod in agreement because there's nothing not to like about these 'straunts (if nobody calls them that then I'm starting it). Unfortunately, part of their brand strategy is to position themselves in busy locations and this one is on the outskirts of a shopping mall in San Jose. I can't think of a busier place in San Jose than a mall unless you say you're at a Cheesecake Factory at a mall. Well you can see where they lost a star here. Aside from waiting an absurdly long amount of time to be seated, the food here is great and accompanied by a tremendous atmosphere with dim lights and eye-catching architecture that is truly sophisticated and eloquent for a chain restaurant. My favorite dishes include the Chicken Bellagio, Kobe Burger, Avocado Egg Rolls, Baja Chicken/Fish Tacos and (sadly not on the menu anymore) Thai Chicken Pasta. If you haven't been here in a while, try it again. They've removed some items and added new concoctions to their arsenal of culinary excellence that you may enjoy. Oh, and Pumpkin Cheesecake.

Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",486,786,1873,4.0,5/24/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory serves a huge variety of food from Asian to Western styled food in a classical modern setting. This particular Cheesecake Factory has heated outside seating which is great if you want to be outside.  Pros Food: The food here is really flavorful here and the wide variety makes it interesting to come and try out the new meals that they have. Like the name suggest this place is known for there cheesecake and they don't disappoint. They have a huge variety of different cheesecakes to choose from. There are no real differences in flavors of food between the Valley Fair and Oakridge area in my opinion. They all taste pretty good.  Outside seating: The outside is heated through large heat lamps spread around the area which is really nice if you want to sit outside on a hot day. Also great if you don't like the inside of the restaurant.  Location: The place is located inside Oakridge Mall so its a fantastic place to shop or see a movie afterwards. Definitely a great place to maybe meet with friends or go out on a date.  Cons Parking: Because this place is located near a mall, parking can be really difficult during peak hours so expect to park far from the restaurant if your going for dinner or peak hours.  Crowded: This place doesn't get as packed at the one in Valley Fair but expect long lines during peak hours. Overall this Cheesecake factory gives you a choice of seating outside or inside which is really nice. The food is good depending on what you order and its in a fantastic location for a girls night out or a date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=420

Evangelina B.,"San Jose, CA",355,533,219,2.0,5/19/2013,"Came here yesterday with my family. Six of us ladies celebrating a late mothers day, and three birthdays for my godmother, counsin and aunt. With six of us we were there to spend money. We arrived around 430 so we knew the wait wouldn't be long. We were seated right away( After we barely found parking in their crazy parking lot). Our waitress seemed like she was having a stressed day. I've been here many times and the service here is a hit or miss.   My grandmother tends to ask a lot of menu questions but that is what we pay for, the service. The entire time our waitress helped us she seemed impatient and never really asked anything else? Before she left the table. If I asked for  a water she just walked away. With five other ladies sitting at the table you'd think she would want less trips? I had ordered a burger with fries and wanted some honey mustard. She came back and said they were out. What a strange thing to be out of. I could see if ketchup was since its used more but honey mustard? Oh well. When my godmother got her meatloaf half of it was burnt. It was brought to her attention but instead of offering a new one she said i'll let the kitchen manager know. When it came time for dessert we all ordered one. There's $45-50 bucks right there, just in desserts!  She came back to say they were out of strawberry cheesecake. My grandmother was no impressed. We all had our desserts and the most popular one they are out of? She quickly made a new choice and got it within a good amount of time.  When we got our bill it was not split the way we asked from the beginning.  I was beginning to write it out when she came by to say sorry I'll fix that for you. We wanted to enjoy our desserts and open presents but our table was full of dirty dishes. We called the manager over to voice our bad experience overall. He seemed to listen but didn't seem like he really cared. We asked if he could send someone to clean our dinner plates so we can enjoy our dessert with a clean table and he said no problem. 15 min later and no one still came. We opened the gifts with dirty plates. As we left my godmother spoke to him that no one came to help clear the table. He said he sent someone and apologized. As we were walking out he came out to say he wanted to know if someone did come but we asked the person to leave the table. We told him that was not true, It seemed a lot of people were lying this day. Perhaps laziness from the staff and it was all being put on the manger. I don't know if ill go to this location again.  And to top it off my godmother got gum on her pants from the booth! No bueno",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=420

For the food I'd give justttttt about a 4. closer to a 3.5 but combined with the service, that's enough to have me coming back for seconds. I can honestly say I don't remember the last time that my service was as memorable as this time. Our server seemed to fit right in with my friends and I as we randomly chose cheesecake factory as our restaurant to have dinner. We originally were about to go to boston market to have a healthy meal, but I am most certainly glad we did not. We were seated promptly by our hostess and immediately met Amy who we found out would be our server for the night. She gave us excellent recommendations as my friends and I were struggling to figure out what we wanted to eat. One of my friends was torn between 2 dishes. One of which she told us was not in the menu and claimed to be even better than his favorite miso salmon. Somehow we ended up convincing him to just get both. I had a hard time deciding on which salad I wanted and she went through the salads and seemed particularly enthusiastic about one of them and I was sold. Ended up ordering a pretty big meal for 3 people but she made everything sound so good we figured we'd just pack up the leftovers for later. Food came out and just to show how personable she is, she stuck with us till my friend ate the new thai salmon dish and let her know if what she claimed was true. Unfortunately we still feel like the miso salmon is better but the thai was still very good. we all laughed and had a good time. We had the fried mac n cheese which always a yummy appetizer. eating my salad made me realize why  she was so enthusiastic about it. it was hella bomb. the marinated steak salad. the steak was done just right. I wanted medium rare but she said that the steak in the salads always came the same way and they're just right so i trusted her and voila. amazing salad. my other friend ordered the grilled pork chop and he said it was mouth watering as every bite kind of just melted in his mouth. and yea, the pork was that soft. all in all a very satisfying meal. OH! almost forgot about our midway meal appetizer. We all kind of wanted to order another ""semi-healthy"" appetizer so we asked amy to accommodate us by randomly picking one for us she thought we'd like. she came back a minute later with a small list. and again. as she listed them, she got particularly excited about the stuffed mushrooms, so we all went ooooooo...and she then informed us that they were hella good and she loved them. sold once again. well that is pretty much it. an eating experience that never had a dull moment all thanks to a server that either loves her job or is really good at pretending she does. she was able to make us all feel comfortable and welcomed. so much so that we felt like we were dining at home.

However, this time around, our waitress went above and beyond. Unfortunately, we didn't tip as much as I had hoped due to some bad math. I had ordered the steak and eggs for lunch and my dish ended up being the last one to come out. To make up for it, our waitress brought me my hashed potatoes first so I could eat while my friends were eating. Eventually, the rest of my meal came, but my steak was not what I was expecting at all! It was some strange, sweet marinade grilled flank. And on top of that, it was cold, but my sunny side up eggs were hot. Not sure what happened to my dish, and I wasn't going to complain about it, but our waitress happened to walk by when I said the meat was cold, and she said she would immediately get it fixed. She let me keep my dish, and about 15 minutes later, brought a small plate of properly cooked and well seasoned steak to me. Now that's what I'm talking about! It was delicious! When we got the bill later, she had taken my plate off! Amazing! I wasn't expecting that since it wasn't her fault, but the chef's, but I really appreciated that. It's really too bad we didn't tip her more, but she singlehandedly restored my faith in the Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=520

Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",448,567,3762,5.0,3/8/2014,"Upon reaching the front from the mall entrance, I was promptly greeted by three smiling hostesses and seated with no wait whatsoever at 6pm on a Thursday night. Our waiter Dustin D was detail oriented and refilled our water at least four times! This was my first visit at the Oakridge location and I was not disappointed. Prior to my dinner, I had yelped regarding customer service and learned about fantastic waiters being on the restaurant's training team. I am completely convinced Dustin is on it. He waited patiently while we decided on appetizers (one of my friends is a vegetarian), so patiently that I had to ask him for a bit more time. We were ready to order when he arrived with our drinks (four waters, one no ice) and he clearly stated the Caesar dressing has anchovies in it, in case we had issues with that. After my friend ordered her veggie burger, he questioned if I was ok with how the Chicken Bellagio was prepared (pan fried chicken, prosciutto, etc.). The calamari was brought out immediately after, crisp and tasty, but who can go wrong with fried calamari? I did expect a garlic aioli but it seems they exchanged that with a mere cream dip. After the Caesar salad arrived, Dustin checked back to see how the appetizers were. We hadn't touched the salad yet, so I said we were still working on it. He said he wanted to make sure everything was ok. I also asked for fresh Parmesan when my meal arrived, which was brought over immediately. Our waters were never empty for longer than five minutes. When dessert time came around, I ordered the ultimate red velvet and white chocolate blueberry cheesecakes to go while a friend ordered carrot cake to go. Our apps and meals were boxed for us and we were asked if there was anything else they could help us with. Our waiter truly cared if our dining experience was up to our standards, and I'm grateful it was since one of our party was a first timer for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=520

There is ALWAYS going to be a wait at this place so don't come here if you can't wait for about 45-60 minutes. If you can wait at Boiling Crab for an hour, you can wait for an hour here. Besides, you're at Macy's so go shop.  I've came here at least 3 times the past few months. And we (bf and I) always share the same two dishes:  Shepard's pie and Mac n Cheese Burger.  I swear, best burger I've had. We always get the burger medium rare (so juicy!) with fried mac n cheese balls between the buns. Plus, the fried mac n cheese balls were featured in Food Network before!  Shepard's pie. I loved it - the flavor, the beef, mash potatoes. Yum!

Amy T.,"San Jose, CA",360,63,31,3.0,1/22/2014,"My sister, my cousin, and I decided to come eat here Tuesday night for our monthly catch-up dinner. We were seated immediately. Our server, Junno, was super sweet and patient with us -especially since we had very complicated orders.  My cousin and I were probably most excited for our side orders of mashed potatoes with wasabi butter but 5 minutes after we ordered it, our server came back to tell us they had run out of wasabi butter. That was the first disappointment of the night. My sister ordered a steak and asked for it to be cooked medium rare. As she began eating it, she then realized it was cooked super well done. So we flagged down our server and he was very apologetic, and immediately brought her plate back to the kitchen to be re-cooked. The manager then approached our table shortly after and was extremely apologetic and sweet. He even told us to save room because he wanted to give us a dessert on the house. The service alone from this point deserved 5 stars on its own because not only were they genuinely apologetic for the minor mistakes, but they even remade my sisters steak, and the manager offered a dessert on the house. We then ordered a red velvet cheesecake in the end and just like déjà vu, the server came back 5 minutes later to tell us that the red velvet flavor was all gone. So we decided on a different flavor. However, the bill then came out and we were charged for the dessert! I'm sure it was  a genuine, honest mistake, but still... It was the fact that the manager had already told us we would receive a dessert on the house. By this point though, it was already 15 minutes until closing, and we're not cheap people so we weren't going to interrupt the busy manager just to comp our dessert.. Overall, the server was great; he did his job very well and it obviously wasn't his fault that certain foods were all gone. On the other hand, no wasabi butter, no red velvet cheesecake, and forgetting to comp our dessert when they promised us it would be, are good enough reasons to take away 2 stars. But I feel like we just came here on a bad night. We've eaten here plenty of times and 8 out of 10 times, I've had a great experience nonetheless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=520

OK, let me start from the beginning.  I called in my to-go order and spoke with a very friendly guy by the name of Joe.  He was courteous, attentive, pleasant - everything you want in a waiter.  I had ordered a burger with a side of honey mustard, jambalaya for my husband, calamari for appetizer and a tiramisu cheesecake for desert.  He reviewed my order at the end, asking if I had needed utensils and also confirmed that I needed the extra honey mustard sauce.  Once confirmed, I felt good going there to pick it up. They have curb side pick up, which is great because this mall can be crazy packed at around 7:00 p.m. for dinner.  I waited on the curb for a good 5-7 minutes before I started to get worried.  I called them up to let them know I was waiting, and a few minutes later, someone came out with my food.  He, too, was friendly and courteous so I tipped him $5 cash for my to-go.   Got home and saw no utensils or my sauce (I like sauce with my burgers, damn it!).  Believe me when I tell you I was a bit disappointed just because they made it seem like they had everything under control.  Eh, the service was whatever, and my burger was a bit bleh.  Guess I'll try dining in next time, just to see if the service and food will be the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=520

From 4-6pm, M-F, Cheesecake Factory has their happy hour in the bar area and I am definitely a new fan! I think happy hour's are the best creation ever and the selection at Cheesecake does not disappoint. They have house wines for $5 a glass, beer for $4, and a few selected cocktails like the Cosmopolitan for $5 as well. They offer two pages of food- the first page is a selection of their full size appetizers for $5! And yes, you get the full size! Fried calamari, sliders, nachos, egg rolls, fried macaroni and cheese balls...I think there were like 10 options. On the back side they offer other food selections ranging from $3.95-6.95 (or something close to that). I had the ahi tuna tartar.....it was good but too small. I recommend ordering from the 1st page of full size appetizers to get your money's worth. All in all, it's the best of Cheesecake quality food for the price of Denny's.

The decor is nice and the lights are dim, setting that romantic tone in such a busy restaurant.  I've been back on a number of occasions. My brother and I absolutely love the 'miso salmon'. It's cooked and served to perfection. The miso sauce is so light, yet flavorful, and it makes the whole dish what it is.  There was one time where I decided to try a different dish. I went with the 'shrimp with angel hair'. Although, the shrimp was huge...the dish itself was lacking in flavor. The pasta was bland and it's not something I would order again.  As weird as it is, I've never tried any cheesecakes during any of my visits, until last night. I went on a whim and ordered the 'chocolate raspberry truffle'.

Eating out is more than the food, though.  Service is key.  Today the Cheesecake Factory blew it big time with their service.  Everything started out ok.  We had to wait 35 min for a table, but with a group of 7 on a Sunday night that wasn't unheard of.  Once we were seated our waiter came right over and took our drink order (and we ordered the crab wantons at that time too).  We got our drinks and our waiter told us that our bread was cooking as well as our wantons.  And then he was gone.   Eventually he came back with our wantons and took our dinner orders (still no bread).  Drinks were never refilled.  We did not see our waiter again until after some of our dinner arrived.  Our meals did not come out together.  Both kids meals and 2 of the adult meals came at first.  Then 2 more arrived, but one entree was delivered with chicken, when it was ordered without chicken (chicken had to be added to this entree for an extra charge).  It was taken away to be fixed.  My brother's entree did not arrive, but our waiter told us it was on its way. Well, the kids and one of the adults finished their meals before my husband found the manager and told him that most of us were finished with our meals and 2 of our meals were still missing and that we had never received our bread.  Then the manager disappeared.  The waiter returned with the fixed entree, but still no entree for my brother.  My brother then told the waiter that he is diabetic and had already taken his insulin in anticipation of dinner so he needed to have food pretty much now or he was going to pass out and cause a medical emergency.  Again the waiter disappeared. This time he reappeared with our bread.  Which my brother used as a band-aid to counteract the insulin.  The waiter told us the manager was waiting on the line and that as soon as the entree was ready it would be delivered.  By this time everyone else was finished eating. Eventually my brother did get his food, and the manager removed it from our bill.  My husband pointed out that one other entree was made incorrectly and it took an inordinate amount of time to be fixed and that entree was also removed from our bill.  My daughter and I each received a complementary dessert for our birthdays. Service goes a long way.  Good service will get repeat customers.  Service like this will have us second guessing ever coming back, regardless of how good the crab wantons are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=540

My boyfriend and I happened to get a waiter that really didn't pay attention to us most likely because we are young and he probably assumed we don't tip (which was bad on his part) but anyways the main reason for my review was because they got my order wrong which I totally understand happens from time to time no big deal. I had the right food but wrong noodles. I was going to suck it up and just eat the meal but I tasted the noodles and they tasted way weird and were awkwardly green. I wasn't going to pay for something that I wasn't going to enjoy. Long story short they took my food and brought me out my other dish and the meal basically had no food.. just nothing but the noodles that I had originally asked for. I don't know if they were trying to teach me a lesson by being up upset I sent it back. It was not great to pay for something and than eat a whole plate of just noodles when I drove 1hr and 30mins just to eat there.

Our server and her helpers were always there, never with an empty drink and always returning promptly with any condiment request and was always within earshot if we needed something. At many restaurants, they split a server's section to a couple tables here and a couple tables there. Here, she had two tables adjacent to our table and 3 tables across the way so she was never very far away. So why not 5 stars?  Some things could be changed, some things obviously not. 1. We were celebrating a birthday. There were 5 or so servers singing happy birthday. It was super lame. They all could care less so much that I couldn't even sing along. 2. This didn't seem like an awkwardly placed table, but it seemed like all the staff walked by and through our section, but it wasn't the main hall, it was just bizzare.  3. The white shoes.

I loved their cole slaw; it's sweet, creamy, and a bit tangy.  I wonder if it's Mayo that makes the difference.  I don't think I have to tell you anything about their cheesecake.  I'll repeat ordering Steh's cheesecake for sure.  Lemon rasberry was too lemony to my liking it reminds me of toilet fragrence (it's not that I ever ate it in my life hehe).

(white bread? who eats plain, thin white bread these days?) Never thought to ask since about the bread, I like most OTHER breads. The red velvet cheesecake (shared) was to die for though! yum city.... The main reason for the BAD REVIEW: used the lady's room, soaped up afterwards, THEN.....NO WATER!! NONE! (Had to just wipe my hands off with dry paper towels) Noticed that others didn't even bother to soap up, so I imagine all three sinks had been down for awhile. Unsanitary? Yeah....a bit!! Means any female servers did not wash their hands! GROSS! People wonder why horrible illnesses are passed along.  Also, something I didn't care for was how DARK it was inside....especially when you were not having a romantic lunch. How about having a light and dark side of the restaurant?

They have trimmed their menu and come up with some really different stuff. The quality of food and service is great and even though generally it is written in stone that chain restaurants should have 3.5 or less this is far better than some of the mom and pops out there. They have great cheese cake. It is the foundation of this business and we really enjoyed lemon raspberry cream cheese cake. Somewhat it was better in the old times but it seems like everything was better in the old times. It's about that whole nostalgia that takes over our minds and drives us to covet what we don't have anymore so that we can pick on what we do. At the end the IPA beer really works with the mushroom burger and it is now and today that counts best.

Next we ordered spinach and cheese dip which basically tasted like frozen spinach and olive oil with a little parmesan on top. Gross. Next was the sweet corn tamales. They were the best part of the whole meal, only reason they get 2 stars. We split a factory burger, which i can say i would have preferred a whopper. The meat was bland, the portion was TINY for $13, the fries were cold and they borough onions on the side not cooked. We had to remind them what was on their menu. When they brought out the grilled onions they were COLD AND SLIMY. Overall I've had better customer service at a McDonald's and better food as well. Speaking of which, the only time we didn't need to flag down a service staff was when he was collecting payment. Nobody ever asked how we were doing, if we were enjoying out meal, anything of that sort. I've been to this place a few times, so I'd be willing to call it a fluke, but they need a more authoritative manager who acts more customer-centric.

I have never been charged for a side of any condiment at any other location before. They however wanted to charge me without even notifying me. After noticing what I thought was an error, I brought it to the waiter's attention he said he must charge for it or should he ask a manager. Then Vincent, the manager, came by and told me that they have to charge me for it, even after I explained. I wasn't happy about it, he then said he will take it off only if I make sure that I would be charged for gravy if I were to ask for extra in the future.

The wait was 45 min like the hostess said. Perfect. We were seated immediately, but it took a while for the server to come by our table. Now, I'm not saying that our server is a bad server, but his service wasnt very good in my experience. Literally visited our table twice- take order and give food. I may look younger, but that doesn't mean your service should be any lower for any customer! We sat down around 8pm ish so it wasnt even that busy anymore. So I expected better service...  I think the menu is too much. Too many options and too much to look at. But, for the most part their food was pretty good.  Miso salmon- $20 , salmon and sauce was so good. Rice- way too dry and grainy. Like, c'mon I'm asian I know good rice....  Mushroom burger-$12,  good sized patty but too much cheese... Kind of overpowered the taste.

Kay T.,"Zzyzx, CA",8,50,28,5.0,11/10/2010,"I went here after going to the Burke Williams day spa nearby. It was noon and I was ready..........to stuff my face with delicious food! I ordered the lunch pasta (pasta da vinci) with a small salad. My mom went with the 9.99 special which included soup, salad, and half a sandwich. When I got my lunch, it was amazing to look at. The Pasta Da Vinci is basically the ultimate pasta. Tender chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions tossed with parmesean cheese in a creamy, rich madeira wine sauce. From the way it looked, it was like the sort of dish you would see in an upscale restaurant or in a magazine. You could tell that a chef made it to order and it wasn't pre-made or reheated.  The salad looked like a work of art. Mixed greens. It was crisp and refreshing. For a ""small side salad"", I didn't think they would put so much. Verdict: awesome. Whereas, the pasta was al dente, the sauce was creamy, rich, flavorful. From the way it tasted, it seemed like they didn't take a lot of steps to make it. Whatever they did, I am in love with this pasta. If you ever go to the cheesecake factory, you have to order this (unless you can't stand onions or mushrooms like my brother, in which case: you should try it anyway lol).  My mom got the crab bisque soup with a turkey sandwich and one of those ""small"" side salads. For 9.99, the platter was massive. It was totally worth it. The soup was delicious and rich. Chunks of crab (might've been lobster) in a creamy white broth. She ate all of it and was already feeling full, but she still had her sandwich and salad to eat Of course, we couldn't leave without trying some of their famous cheesecakes. I'm not normally a cheesecake fan, but I'll always make an exception for this place. I picked the key lime cheesecake and my mom got a godiva cheesecake with the chocolate tower cake. The key lime cheesecake was creamy, with a citrusy tang that cleans your palate. If you like lighter, fruitier desserts at the end of a heavy meal, like me, get this. Even though the key lime cheesecake was good, I'm secretly hoping that the mango-lime cheesecake makes a comeback (it's my favorite!). The godiva cheesecake would've been insanely good.......had it not been put up against the insanely gargantuan chocolate tower.  The chocolate tower consists of solid layers of chocolate mousse, thick chocolate frosting, thick chocolate shavings, thick fudge chunks and moist chocolate cake, all thrown together to form the ultimate chocolate masterpiece. It is about 8 inches long and massive. I would love to see what the entire cake looks like before they cut it. lol Yet, in terms of flavor, it is not too overwhelming. It has a balance to it, so that all of the awesomeness doesn't overwhelm you at one time. Basically, if you are a chocolate lover, order this dessert and you will not regret it (only if you try to eat all of it in one sitting). lol I only took a few bites at a time because it really is that rich. All of the desserts came with the signature real whipped cream and my tummy was happy for the rest of the day. lol Totally worth it. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=600

However, the kids enjoy it so we still go. Had an unfortunate event this last time, however.  Long story short, the lettuce on my son's kid's slider burgers was brown and crusty. I'm assuming that it was because it was placed on the side of the burger and kept under the heat lamp until the rest of the food was ready. But worse than that, there was a string in my meatloaf! At first I thought it was a very course hair (which would have been worse).  The saving grace was the manager who was on it like white on rice. He's the reason my review went from 1-2 stars to 4. He took care of the bill and got me a new order all wrapped up to go. I know this type of stuff sometimes happens and it just comes down to how the establishment reacts.

Alena B.,"Silicon Valley, CA",157,821,21,2.0,6/5/2011,I really don't get the appeal.  The wait is long and the food is mediocre.  They don't even have a children's menu which is a bummer.  The menu is HUGE which means that they do a little bit of everything and nothing very well.  I always opt for the chicken pasta because it's a safe bet.  The Teriyaki chicken wasn't great...i guess the potstickers are okay too.  The two stars I am giving it is for the cheesecake...which is OF COURSE delicious!   Please please please go somewhere else for date night....go to some cute little local hole in the wall in support of local businesses and find something amazing rather than waiting with a pager for 45 minutes outside this place with everyone else.  It's really nothing special...unless you are getting cheesecake!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=640
Neon D.,"San Jose, CA",155,92,9,5.0,5/7/2010,"I am a weekly regular to CCF and let me give you the rundown.. bullet points, no less: (let's start off with the good stuff, shall we?) * Amazing food selection. You feel like going Tuna crazy? You can! I love the Tataki Rare Tuna salad which comes with the most divine dressing ever! The fried tuna rolls are to die for and every other rare tuna dish they serve is top-notch. * If you feel like pigging out, then this is your spot. The servings are SO huge that I took home HALF of my meal and told my fiance it was the meal I bought for him. He believed it!!! I'm evil, too! The waitress even helped me add extra garnish and was in on my plan! Muahhhh! * The staff (except for the hostesses, sorry) are freaking amazing. We've had waiters that looked like Dolce & Gabbana models. They are all fun and we always end up talking about some crazy customer or annoying kid in the restaurant. I love it! The sad part is, I never get the same person and I do have my favorites! It is fun to mix it up though. I like to sit outside in the summer. The hostess staff hasn't always been so friendly, sometimes all-out snobby and snappy. Ew, honey, you ain't that cute to have that kind of attitude.  * Ok, so I think I crossed into 'the bad things' territory. It takes forever to get the hell out of there. I think I spend at least 2 hours in there just at a casual dinner on a Thursday or Saturday night. Sometimes I don't want cheesecake, but am a sucker for that damned Red Velvet Cheesecake. I get it every single time and once ate the entire thing by myself. Ughh. the shame! The only thing they are missing is a wheelchair service because I can't walk when I'm through with dessert! I've given thousands of my dollars to CCF over the span of 3 years and from them, have acquired the biggest waistline I've ever had. Wow.. and I don't feel dirty saying it was worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=640
Kelly B.,"San Jose, CA",100,225,167,3.0,7/30/2008,"Six of us celebrating Mom and Dad's FIFTY-NINTH wedding anniversary.  It was also The Cheesecake Factory's anniversary, which meant that all cheesecakes were 1.50.  Wow, cool! The food was good, I had a mini-pizza and a salad.  Portions were huge, we all took home boxes of food,  enough for dinner tonight!  The menu was fresh, everyone found something that they liked, even my dad, who is a picky eater (he was severely challenged when we took him to Bennihana!) said that his fish and chips were the best he's ever had.  My sister said that was because they started with Ahi tuna! This is one BIG restaurant!  It is HUGE!  There must be fifty tables in the restaurant, and perhaps why it feels like you are in a big barn, with food being shoveled out at you.  It would be the relationship with your food server that could make or break your dining experience, because this is the one thing that distinguishes you from those other tables. A word about the service.  Well, it wasn't rude, it was just...  well, it's hard to put a finger on it.  Let's just say... it wasn't warm and it wasn't attentive.  We had to flag our waiter down for more bread (he brought one basket of three breads for our table of six, one of whom was having just a salad).  When we told him it was Mom and Dad's anniversary, he said, ""oh, kewl (the all lower case is on purpose, because that's how he said it: all lower case).""  One of the weirdest things was that other waiters came looking to see if we were ok, and one, when checking on us said in a really snippy way, ""Well, _you're_ ok!"" and rushed off.  It was really strange, but it's about what you can expect when you are being waited on my 18- to 20-year-old waiters and waitresses.  So, there it is, it all comes down to attitude.   Would I go there again?  Sure, it would be perfect to meet girlfriends for lunch or for an appetizer when shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=640

Toni C.,"Benicia, CA",96,56,4,4.0,12/17/2012,"I don't know why I like the Cheesecake Factory so much.  Maybe it's because even though it's a chain restaurant it's on the upscale side?  I don't know.  I just know I like coming here and I like the looks of the place. My Hub and I were served by the lovely and gracious Vera H.  I wasn't in a very pleasant mood when we arrived (it was on the warm side and the air conditioner in the car wasn't working right.  :(  but sweet Vera was very patient and I'd say even kind to me.  ;)  The Hub ordered an iced tea and I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.  Things started looking better after the LIIT.  ;)  We both ordered a bowl of clam chowder (as we are continually on a quest for the definitive clam chowder) and the Crab and Artichoke Dip appetizer.  Although the clam chowder was very good and full of clams, celery, potatoes and all the other goodies, I wouldn't say it was the definitive clam chowder.  Still, it was good and I would order it again.  But oh!  Was the dip ever yummy!  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was served on crunchy baked and seasoned french bread strips; the dip had a very delicate flavor of it's own, and it had to ""fight"" with the flavor and crunchiness of the french bread.  I used the softer bread that was served in the basket  and found that it tasted so much better.  You could actually taste the flavor of the crab!  Huzzah!  We should've stopped there, but no.  We ordered (and shared) a Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira Combination plate.  I think I have finally found my favorite dish at the Cheesecake Factory.  The beef was covered in mushrooms and cooked to medium rare and was so tender and delicious.  The chicken was covered in mushrooms and cheese and served with a delicious sauce.  The dish is served with mashed potatoes. If that wasn't enough, we got a slice of ""Original"" (New York Style) cheesecake to go.  No way did we have the room to eat it there. This was above and by far the best eating experience we've had at the Cheesecake Factory.  We've always enjoyed our food when we've eaten there, but last night's meal topped them all. 9/22/2012 / First posted 12-17-2012",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=660

We were waiting on tables who camped out for like 30-60mins after they paid their bill... Well at least our waitress was funny. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was surprisingly good, despite the fact that I don't like bell peppers or spicy food. The portions are a little small for ~$15, but there is unlimited free bread to fill you up!  What they don't tell you is that the birthday chocolate cheesecake is another $8! I never knew that.

I came here for a secret santa event with my friends and it was shortly before christmas so naturally parking was a pain (not that I was driving hehe).  We didn't have reservations because we made a change of plans from our original restaurant so we did have to wait; surprisingly the wait wasn't as long as we thought considering we had a huuuuge group. As we were seated in this lengthy booth, they quickly got us our drinks and as we ordered and waited for our food they constantly came to check up if we need refills...personally this annoys me but I know they're just trying to maintain good customer service so I just kind of shrugged it off. I did love the fact that they had bread out while we waited, restaurants are doing that less and less now. I got the four cheese pasta like I do at every other restaurant because I loooooooooove pasta.  The entrees were meh; not bad and at the same time not exactly something I would rave about.  For some reason my dish tasted better after I took it home and microwaved it the next day. Their bathrooms were clean and spacious like any other decent restaurant bathroom.

We were the first to arrive from our group and walked in through the mall, they had a lot of empty tables but told us we had a twenty minute wait for our group of 4. Twenty five minutes later we were seated and our server explained the specials of the day. She took our drinks order and returned 15 minutes later with warm bread and our drinks. There menu is HUGE - not kidding - like a booklet with ads and everything! After persuing for awhile we decided to order: Appetizer -Thai Lettuce Cups - 4 stars (we shared this between the four of us since it's large portion) Dad wanted the soup of the day which our server had recommened not 10 minutes ago but she returned to tell us that were out! Should have checked prior to making the recommendation.. oh well! Dad settled on a green salad... he said it was okay good. Mom also had a salad - the goat cheese with the spring mix and cherry vinagrette which she enjoyed. Dave had their coconut chicken and shrimp curry which came with rice, he said it was good and liked it. He liked the toasted coconit garnished all over the curry. I ordered the Jamaican Pepper Chicken and Shrimp which ame with rice and plaintains. The plaintains were a little over cooked and mushy but the rest of the dish was okay -it missed the pepper kick I was looking for. The ambience was nice, they have a full bar and the service was a little slow.

Maronita I.,"San Jose, CA",314,77,8,3.0,4/1/2010,"3.5 stars rounded up... I am a bit biased since this was my first job when I moved to SJ. I worked here for 9 months and learned how to truly take care of guests because their training is very intense.  They have to follow 12 steps of service such as: Greeting time, ticket times, refolding your napkin if you get up, showing you to the restroom if you should ask, always bringing share plates when an app is ordered, proper silverware for certain items, wet naps for messy items, etc etc.  (If you come here and don't get good service it's because their best server is gone.. ME who else did you think I was talkin about. LOL. jk) This restaurant is ridiculous...they have a book for a menu.  There are about 200 menu items making it extremely hard to decide. While you are browsing the pages, the server will bring you sourdough and pumpernikel bread (yaaa i said it.. PUMPERNIKEL w/ Oats on it) and REAL butter pats. To top it off it's fresh baked on site.  Some of my favorties are as follows: ****Jamaican Black Peper Shrimp--served with white rice, black beans, fried plantains and a mango salsa--outta this world good. HUGE PLATE!!! *****Firecracker Salmon Rolls Appetizer---kinda spicy so watch out if you're a woosie! *****Sante Fe Chicken Salad----all time fave. It's drizzled with their very own spicy peanut sauce. *****Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake---3 layers of chocolate goodness. Those are just a few to name...You must try it if you never have. If you have and had a bad experience...give it another shot. When asking for a table be sure to ask for their best server...(most likely you will get a ""D.T""..which means a designated trainer. These guys are super passtionate about their job and they will take great care of you. Last night, Paul served my GF and I... he was awesome. I got their Arugula Salad and it came out lookin old and tired...he didn't charge me for it, which was nice. She and I shared the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, it comes with ff but we got a salad. I alwaysss add buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing to mine; it's outta this world. If you feel too stuffed after dinner --- and i promise you will --- take some cheesecake to go. You won't regret it.  P.S. Cheesecake makes alllllllll of their dressings and sauces from scratch on site.  The cheesecakes are made at the bakery off site.

Mix the sauce with the pasta and add a bit of the chicken and bam! Explosion of the reduced white whine, a slight tang of the lemon, the creaminess from the (you guessed it) CREAM, and the saltiness of the capors. OoOO wee--! I love it!  Now, you all know that there is several choices there. I can't guarantee they will all be good. I've heard the sweet and sour was a bit eh. I do like the chicken salad sandwich (that crunchy bread is to die for!). The new small plates menu is pretty awesome. YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THE VIETNAMESE TACOS. I can't even describe them.

If I wanna celebrate something, it's definitely one of the first places that I want to go to. I always get pasta so I never tried much of their other food but the pastas that I have tried (louisiana chicken, carbonara, alfredo fettucine) are reallyyy good and the portions are huuuge so I always have left overs for the next day. I think that their mac and cheese balls are to die for! Definitely the appetizer I get but I usually don't get an appetizer so I have more room for my pasta. I've also had their alcholic beverages. I've had the long island tea and the pineapple mojito. They were both good and let me tell you, they do not skimp you on the alcohol. They were strongg and I got buzzed off one of em. Also love the complimentary bread!

My pasta Da Vinci had  pieces of sausage in it besides the chicken then after 15 minutes they made another one full of water guess they call it sauce. The server kinda brushed it off when I mention the water based sauce. Called and talk to the manager and she keep asking questions and making me repeat the same answers over and over, maybe she thought I wanted a free meal. They need to work on there people skills specially when someone calls to bring something bad to there attention .paid for the food that I didn't even eat. That's all I have to say.

I'll focus on the foods then. The spicy meat pizza is the best. It combines three things I love: spicy, meat, and pizza. I'll admit that cheesecake factory entrees are calorie ridden and not very good for you but with pizza it's easier to stop myself and save a slice or two for later and have it still taste good! After all, the free bread is pretty filling. On the other hand, I did not enjoy my eggs Benedict at all. The eggs were overcooked and half the plate was just hash browns. For the price, that much potato was kinda a cop out. Mostly I'm just annoyed by the overcooked eggs though.  Overall, service is a gamble since they have so many people working here. You can expect the atmosphere to be clean and neat since it's a chain. Stick to the safer pastas and pizzas that they seem to be better at and for your own health, try not to finish the whole entree in one sitting...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=620

It was good with or without the dipping sauces they provide and there was plenty for both of us to share.  We also got one entree that we split between us - Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It claims to come with pine nuts, but when it arrived we couldn't seem to find them. After asking the waitress about it she offered to get us some more pine nuts, no problem! We made sure to save room for dessert and we each got a slice of cheesecake. I got Oreo and my mom got the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, which was phenomenal.

Badri N.,"San Jose, CA",601,324,137,3.0,7/17/2009,"Went here on Thursday night with fellow Yelper Noelle W. after watching a movie at the mall. Location is easily accessible from the 85 and 87 freeways but parking, oh my, is parking a nightmare or what!!!!  My advice - don't even try to find surface parking in front of all the restaurant chains if it's after 6 PM - you will waste fuel and endanger the planet!  Head on into the parking garage, up to level 2 or above and you will usually find parking quite readily.  And you don't have to walk in the sun/rain/wind - or other natural element!  FTW! ~ 2 stars for location (- 2 stars for parking situation!!!) Decor is your typical cheesecake factory - faux Italian marble everywhere, very elegant looking, with high ceilings, very wide open spaces and airy, comfortable atmosphere.  Tables are packed but not too closely together so it is possible to have a conversation.  It's not too dark and it's conducive for a lot of different occasions - from business meetings to family outings to quiet dinners. ~ 4 stars for ambiance and decor We were seated promptly and the waiter (Christian) was almost immediately there to explain specials and take our drink orders.  He was also training a rookie waitress who was very polite and professional throughout the meal though she did forget a couple of things and had to go back and fetch them.  But that's how you learn, so no points subtracted for that - everyone's gotta learn and she certainly had the right attitude about it!  Our food arrived promptly (except for the cheesecake which took a really long time!!!), drinks were kept filled and takeout containers brought out promptly on request! ~ 4 stars for service Now, the food.  I never have high expectations when eating at these mega chain restaurants.  Especially ones that have menus that are reminiscent of phone books.  It was amusing to read the little supplement that listed the caloric values of all the menu items.  I didn't see one single item there that was less than 1000 calories and quite a few that were over 2500 calories!!!  Aiyiyi - Good Lord have mercy!!!!   I ordered the Baja chicken tacos which were quite good but nothing like the neighborhood taqueria.  Chicken was quite flavorless but the seasoning was good, especially the generous amount of cilantro!!  The black beans were OK but the rice was kind of a cool mixture between normal brown rice and a Chinese inspired fried rice with peas and scallions - I enjoyed the rice and I'm normally not a big rice eater! Noelle got a burger protein style and it came wrapped nicely in aluminum foil (I was surprised but it was a cool way to keep it warm!!).  Also, they had followed her special instructions quite well and she seemed to enjoy it.   ""I normally don't eat dessert.""  This is what I said when the waiter brought around the dessert menu.  But I proceeded to completely demolish the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake which was good but a tad too rich - I've always enjoyed the plain New York style cheesecake and should stick to that - no creative flavors for me - I'm a simple guy with simple tastes!!!  It was smothered in way too much whipped cream - I had to push the cream out of the way and ended up eating much much more dessert than I would normally eat in a month!  Bleh...  major food coma looked certain in my future - thank goodness I had a short drive home where I could be at least be comfortable if I ended up getting sick - thankfully, I didn't! Total check for 1 beer, 1 iced tea, two entrees and two cheesecakes = $47 ($57 with tip) - not too shabby! ~ 3 stars for food - it met expectations (which were not too high, being a chain restaurant) ~ 3 stars overall for Cheesecake Factory.  Fun place, decent food, really good prices and value, great service and a nice ambiance.   # 112",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=720

Iona C.,"Orinda, CA",491,374,1909,3.0,4/21/2007,"Menus at The Cheesecake Factory have one side covered with a company's advertisement and the other with an actual list of dishes, something I've definitely never seen before. The process of choosing a dish can take a while since there are many sections to look through: Appetizers, Pizza, Specialties, Lunch Specials, Pastas, Fish & Seafood, Steaks and Chops, Salads, Sandwiches, Eggs & Omelettes, Sunday Brunch, Desserts, Cheesecakes, From Our Bar, and Beverages. Luckily for me, I happened to get there before 5 P.M., and could still order from their Lunch Specials. I opted for their Four Cheese Pasta (mozzarella, romano, parmesan, and ricotta with marinara sauce and fresh basil). It didn't take too long for my food to arrive, but when it did, I was a shocked by the portion size. In the Lunch Specials menu there was a small line saying that that section provided menu favorites in smaller portions. Now if what I saw in front of me was supposed to be 'smaller'... then I certainly did not want to see what the full sized portion looked like. If one healthy portion is said to be the size of your palm, the Four Cheese Pasta was easily four or five portions.  At first glance, the Four Cheese Pasta didn't look that spectacular. But once I dipped my fork in, I realized that the four cheeses were hidden under a layer of the penne rigate style noodles they used. The blend of cheeses with potent fresh basil and chunky tomatoes in the marinara sauce made for a definite A+ rating. Now here is where I get to talk about the crowning part of our experience at The Cheesecake Factory, the desserts!  I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake (layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse ),  The desserts arrived a few minutes later.  I'm a complete 'chocoholic' and thus fell completely in love with that dessert. The smooth, creamy texture of the cheesecake combined with the richness of Godiva chocolate made for a winning combination!  With one of the Lunch Specials, a dessert, and tip, you should expect to pay around $20. Overall, I found that The Cheesecake Factory has pretty good food, but their specialty is definitely in their delicious cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=720

Mike N.,"San Jose, CA",28,22,5,3.0,3/10/2010,"Ladies and Gentlemen,  Somehow my friends and I (6 of us) ended up here and spent over $100 (no drinks) off their happy hour menu. We had a voucher for a free slice of cheesecake for every $30 spent. We became legends... We ordered everything off their happy hour menu (x2 or sometimes x3 off things we liked). We had to combine two tables and still couldn't fit all the food. The waiter was amazed and never seen anything like this.  We enjoyed their sliders, cuban sandwiches, macaroni balls, thai lettuce wraps, cobb salad and of course gobbs of free bread. Sliders - small, kinda shiny (greasy) but easy, fun to eat. Be sure to get the side order of fries for a buck. Cuban Sandwiches - toasty, pork and ham go well together, with the swiss cheese melting off the side. YUM! Fried Mac and Cheese - very interesting since it doesn't taste like the box mac and cheese. It doesn't have the overly cheese taste which makes it good. Marinara sauce compliments the FM&C. Thai Lettuce Wraps - chicken with lettuce and a few veggies with sauce. Very tasty when using peanut sauce. Def. not as good as the Asian places but it does its job. Cobb Salad - typical salad but good to order to accompany all the heavier foods Everything else (off their happy hour menu) we could pass on.  Now for the 3 Cheesecake, we got plain, red velvet, and Oreo. Plain is the lightest and taste like ehhhh. Oreo was my favorite since who doesn't like oreos with cheesecake. Red Velvet was humongous. People in my party liked it but man I think its over 1500 calories. Overall food is decent.

They are always packed on Friday nights so make sure you're okay waiting up to an hour. I've placed ordered for curb side pick up, but really there's no such thing. They say it's curb side but they never actually go to your car, they make you come inside because they never answer the phone in that booth. Food is overall okay. I love getting the fried mac and cheese balls. My go to fish is the Louisiana pasta chicken. Calamari is so so but I'm picky.

Jesseca T.,"Los Alamos, NM",129,478,72,1.0,1/5/2008,"I'm veg, try to eat healthy, and have no interest in sweets...so maybe, like McDonalds, it's just NOT the place for me.  I know this is not a popular opinion to have and I've gone back a few times to try to change my opinion, but I can't. Every time my coworkers get excited about a special lunch out and actually propose this overpriced CHAIN, I feel like gagging. Am I the only person that thinks a phone book/menu is excessive and unnecessary?  It is very difficult to have a vegetarian, non-fried appetizer and lunch course here that doesn't consist of some nutritionally poor substitute like iceberg lettuce with ranch dressing, or my favorite : ""grilled veggies"" (read: squash and zucchini).  Also, the inflated prices and service were an insult- last time our waitress treated us like we were an inconvenience. I can easily think of ten other places to spend $25 on lunch.

OK, I keep doing this reality check, or am I the ONLY one suffering from the economy. Why is this place busy?  So we are seated in 10 minutes as promised. The staff was nice, attentive, did the ""I'll be right back to let you know our specials & get you drinks."" I like that -- acknowledgment goes a long way with me. So we order water, an Arnold Palmer, a Well Behaved Dirty martini (yummy) and for food we get the Santa Fe Salad and the Navajo Sandwich. The food was edible, nothing to jump up and down about, but edible. The bread on my Navajo sandwich was nice and warm, it made me think how nice it would be if I could just eat the bread. The drinks and food came promptly and was nice. I keep wanting to like the Cheesecake Factory, but it seems like I spend most of my time reading advertisements in the MENU, and when I see something I like and want to talk about what I ordered -- I feel like I'm playing Battleship! to explain where this food item is on the menu ... ""Oh, so go to page 18 ... row 36 ... section 4 on the menu so you can see what I'm getting."" And what is with the ADVERTISEMENTS? I feel like I'm at some odd restaurant version of an amusement park. The Coca-Cola in the beverage section isn't enough? You mean you have to try to pimp it for me on what Coca-Cola couples with? People ... it's not a rare 40 yr old vintage bottle of wine that I know nothing about -- it's the stuff we've been drinking all of our lives! OK, OK, I'm crawling off of my soap-box. Maybe I just don't get it, maybe if I need a LOT of food, this is where to visit. Maybe if I was 21 and trying to grow out of Chili's, this might be the spot.

Ricky E.,"Los Gatos, CA",208,33,,1.0,12/16/2011,"HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE!!!!!!           Either my previous bad yelp review came to bite me in the ass, or service here just  SUCKS whatsoever! Our server is lucky I forgot her name, otherwise I would have reported her to the manager on how forgetful and inattentive she was. When we sat down, I immediately noticed our table was bare. No salt/pepper shakers, no napkins or silverware. uhhh, bussers? hello? To start off, we ordered our drinks. I had ordered a regular Mojito, and my girlfriend ordered a strawberry margarita (not-blended) and two glasses of water. #1. She came back to our table because for some reason the bartender couldn't make my gf's margarita non-blended. Umm okay? So instead the gf ordered a red sangria. THEN she returned to our table and said that they only had white sangria. Okay. About 5 minutes had passed, and still no drinks, no water, NO SILVERWARE OR NAPKINS! Our server finally dropped off our drinks, and still hadn't brought us our waters. #2. So we proceeded to order our food. My gf had asked for a modification on her BLT Salad (no bleu cheese, sub cheddar). I watched our server mumble ""no bleu cheese, sub cheddar"" as she was writing it down. After taking our order, I asked if I could keep a menu with me just in case I wanted to order something more since we were only ordering off the small bites menu. She said okay, and quickly collected ALL the menus and walked away before I could even comprehend what was going on and stop her from taking my menu away. Oh well, whatever.   As we were waiting for our food, our server came and told us that the bread was baking and would be out with a fresh batch in a few minutes. A different server then came out with a few baskets of bread and was dropping them off to other tables around us that had already gotten bread so they declined, but how would our table get missed? Food finally came out, and guess what? BLEU CHEESE ON THE SALAD!! AND NO NAPKINS OR SILVERWARE YET! There was a moment where there were two servers at our table, (one dropping off food, and another finally bringing us our silverware). I sent the salad back instantly. And I also noticed that the server who was dropping off our silverware was placing them directly on the table, without any napkins or anything. Umm excuse me, but I don't know if the table is clean/sanitized or not. After being asked ""can I get you anything else?"" I replied, ""Yeah, we still have no napkins, we didn't get our bread, or our waters.""  I was about to ask our server if she needed a new pair of glasses because of her lack of attention to our table. So our waters finally came, after the food! and bread on our table halfway through our meal. We ate quickly because I was really upset with the lack of attentiveness and the incompetence of the floor staff. IT WASN'T EVEN BUSY!  #3 When I had asked for the check, she gave us the tab for the table to left left of us, I corrected her, and she then gave us the tab to the table to the right of us. WAKE UP B*TCH!!! We finally got our correct bill, paid, and left. And for that horrible experience, I left a 72 cent tip, and walked out quickly.

Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",303,1561,73,3.0,7/31/2008,"OK so 7/30/08, Wednesday, was $1.50 cheesecake slices at all locations.  So on most occasions, in a nutshell, the menu is huge, the food is huge, the service is usually very attentive based on the crowdedness, and the wait for a table is usually bad on weekends, and the price is about $20 per person on average for a meal.  This review is for 7/30/08 and the chaos that occurred at this location. Heading there, I knew I was heading into an atmosphere where the wait time will be long for a table.  So my friend Viv and I grabbed a pager, reserved our table for 2, went next door to CPK, ate a meal there, and then came back to Cheesecake and surprisingly, our pager never went off...we went from 30th on the list to 5th in about 40 minutes...we were seated quickly and we sat down to our $1.50 slices after waiting about 35 minutes after placing our order with our waiter.  When the cheesecake did come to our table, I could tell it came out of their freezer recently because the cheesecake was hard, really rock hard...still edible but not soft.  The people that handle the cheesecake servings were in the shit...orders piling up and no end in sight.  I felt bad for those guys...they certainly earned their dollars on that night. The policy and rule for the $1.50 slices were dine-in only...yet I saw some people were able to not only order one slice per person to take-out, but also in some cases, order multiple slices to take-out!  Their policy wasn't enforced very strictly and amidst all the pandemonium from that day, I can certainly understand.  Will this experience affect if I'll go back?  Probably not...but I definitely won't be going on a cheap cheesecake promotion night again...if I want frozen dessert, I'd rather get froyo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=700

The food is soooo good and the prices are decent for the quality and amount of food you get. My favorite is the hibachi steak with mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. My go to favorite every time that never disappoints! The fried Mac and cheese appetizer is delicious and can be a meal in itself. This is my boyfriend'a favorite date night place in San Jose. Although the wait for a table can be quite long, especially on the weekends because they also don't do reservations (thus the minus one star) the service we got was good. The restroom smelled like fruit loops but the floor was a bit slippery. With a huge slice of amazing evil cheesecake (caramel Dutch apple streusel and peanut butter cup fudge) to go, left overs, and a very satisfied belly, this was a successful date night restaurant and conveniently located next to the movie theaters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=700

Husband's Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was defined as 99% chicken and 1% shrimp. One piece of shrimp. One piece. Ugh. Pathetic. I got the huge portion of chicken caesar salad and I think I had about 2 oz (if I was lucky) of chicken on my plate. Hubby gave me some chicken off his dish. Our friend got some pasta dish...but I can't remember the name. Dessert was the only thing that made me happy - the lemoncello cream torte was wonderful.

I ordered the petite filet (mignon), and imagine my pleasant surprise to discover that it was every bit as good as any steak I've ever had, anywhere.  It was an outstanding steak, perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned, needing no salt, butter, sauce, or the like.  The horseradish I had requested sat mostly untouched, the steak was so good by itself. The service was as friendly and attentive as one would expect, but the steak was well above and beyond.  Strange as it feels to say this, I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=700

It's a large hall type of feeling.  Tall ceiling, wooden booths, long, large bar and nice.  It felt very clean, I like that! At the bar waiting I got a vodka pineapple  - the bartender wasn't very friendly and bordered on rude.  I know it was busy, but in general I'm nice . . . . . shouldn't he be? Escorted to our booth, it was spacious, receeded and felt private even in a totally crowded room.  I ordered the steak with mushrooms.  In general for the price it was pretty disappointing.  Not a lot of flavor, the sauce was too thick, the cut of meat not juicy . . . just not that great. I guess if you know that you want something here it could be worth it, maybe some of the more casual dining items or cheesecake!  But I'd pass again on this much too crowded spot. *The waiter was nice, a young man who was attentive without being overly so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=760

Extremely friendly waitress.  Decent service. Chipotle Pasta- what a great taste!  Was a bit wary about the description but had a really nice, mild spice to it.  However, it listed asparagus and unfortunately, there was none on my pasta and was not told that in advance.  I would suggest always telling your customers if you are out of something and have a suggestion ready for something else. My mom had the Navao sandwich and without bread so she mixed it up like a salad.  Was quite delicious.  Also, there are plantains with a jamaican dish and they allowed her to sub those instead of fries so if you are ever in the mood for plantains, that is doable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=760

The food came in a reasonable time as well. Friendly, smiled a lot, and she got a big tip. Bad experience: Again, I went with my boyfriend and our waiter was a complete asshole.

Sooooo nice, he had to take care of some other stuff and he even introduced us to a new waiter which was hella nice too! We had to go to the Twilight Release party and we told him and he was doing the best he could to get us all situated and ready to go asap!  The food is prepared better here too. For some reason my macaroni and cheese was a little more not watery, but it had less cheese but it had more flavor than the one at Valley fair. The Avacado eggrolls were hella good too. My coworker ordered a georgia peach & I ordered a mango smoothie. My mango smoothie had more fruit for decoration for some reason than the Vfair location. I usually get just a strawberry, but min had a lime, strawberry and i think an orange slice? It was hella yumm. I'd mos def come back to this one just cause the service!

Judy C.,"San Jose, CA",245,65,,3.0,8/22/2013,"For a chain, I think Cheesecake Factory is a good place to have a nice catch up with friends or a relaxed date. The mood is casual, not too loud where you have to scream across the table to speak to somebody, and the food is good and shareable. I also like how they have small bites because I like variety and I can never finish my own entree. Pricing is very reasonable and cheesecake can get overwhelming, so, like many people, I encourage you to share a slice. What I've tried so far: -Avacado Egg Rolls:  If you love avocados, you'll love their avocado egg rolls. You'll get a heaping amount of avocado in your mouth with the first bite!  -Caesar Salad: Can't really go wrong with a salad. Good part about it was that they didn't drench it in dressing. -Mushroom Soup: Tasty but started to taste a little salty at the end. A cup is actually in a bowl so it's good to share if you have an entree coming out. I can only imagine how big the bowl portion is... -Miso Salmon: Sweet honey glaze, flavorful, and delicious! I opted for brown rice. -Salisbury Steak: Too Salty, SKIP! I was craving sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions that day and didn't want to get a burger (laying low on the carbs). It sounded good but it wasn't. Bleh! Took it home and made a loco moco out of it. -Lemon Chicken: YUM!

The service was friendly and rather quick, although it wasn't too crowded. Our waitress was helpful, even though I apparently unintentionally hit on her, and didn't mind giving four different bills. I can imagine it taking much longer at normal eating hours, but we were there around 9:45PM. As for the hitting on thing, I was asking her how filling the fried mac and cheese was and she said it was pretty heavy, and I said something like ""I hope so... I'm a hard man to please."" She immediately decided to ask everyone else for their meals instead after being weirded out by that, hah. The food was fine. I got fried mac and cheese which filled me up very well, and at only 9 bucks it was a steal compared to other meals. My friends got different pasta dishes and they all said they were okay, but also felt as if they'd overpaid for them. I got a 'sweetened green tea' as a drink which tasted really good, and thankfully they gave free refills so that was a plus. The key lime cheesecake was also good. Overall we had a fine time but be ready to either stretch your dollars by getting appetizers or just come without the expectation that you're getting an amazing $15 meal.

The three of us shared the fried chicken sliders with fries (remember the Chicken Littles at KFC? Admit it, you liked them too. Well, these are like that, but crispier and more filling) and the chicken quesadillas, which were full lunch sized portions for us. It was so much food, that we ended up taking some home. A slice of cheesecake is always in order here, and we shared the white chocolate macademia nut (very nutty).

Totran M.,"San Jose, CA",62,122,54,3.0,3/10/2009,". . . don't be fooled this is not a fine-dining establishment as The Cheesecake Factory would like to believe -- it is a chain and they cut corners to turn as many tables as possible. The cheesecakes and most of the desserts come to the place frozen (""deeply chilled"" as they like to call it), the 'shortcake' for the Strawberry Shortcake dessert is the same biscuit they use for the chicken and biscuits.  For a chain with a menu with 200+ items you're going to have hits and misses. I do like their chicken madeira and they have the best strawberry lemonade I've ever had at any establishment.  Atmosphere: It can be loud on busy nights, if you aren't in a booth you can end up at a banquet sitting too closely to your neighbors, decor is nothing amazing but nicer than other chains, if you sit outside you have a view of the parking lot which can smell like sewer Service: All the staff is trained to give you the best dining experience BUT some servers/hostess don't give a poop. Unfortunately, like many places, the servers will judge you on whether or not you look like a good tipper. If you don't order drinks or appetizer you can pretty much forget being waited on properly. Food: Don't come here for authenticity. Most items on the menu are good and you get HUGE portions -- enough for 2 or 3 meals. Cleanliness: The kitchen is clean and nothing gross. Bathrooms are taken care of by the front desk hostess's -- if its not stocked and clean tell someone at the front desk. Value: If you are willing to wait to be seated I'll say that the food quality and amount served are worth the prices",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=780

I've been ordering to-go recently and experience major problems. Of what you may ask? Someone picks up and puts you on hold for 15 minutes for a to-go order? I could've been in there receiving my food already. It's really unfair and I've spoken with the workers as well. They claim that there's only one person working at the bakery/togo section. If you're a damn manager you should clearly know that's unacceptable for a restaurant like cheesecake. Not saying it's a 5 star restaurant or anything but most dishes ranges at around 15-20 dollars. So I should be provided decent service whether I am dining inside or outside. Hire more people , I'm sure you can afford it.

Yan G.,"San Francisco, CA",367,485,4,2.0,1/26/2009,"The first time I visited The Cheesecake Factory, I thought it was THE BEST THING EVER!  Yep, I was walking around Baltimore and stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant.  The year was 1999.  Internet stocks were going through the roof, Bill Clinton had his hands full with Ms. Lewinsky, and the Denver Broncos won their second straight Super Bowl.  Ahh, the good old days. ""We'll fast forward to a few years later And no one knows except the both of us And I have honored your request for silence And you've washed your hands clean of this"" I still don't know what Alanis meant by all this, but it seemed appropriate here.  Anyway, ten years later I realize that The Cheesecake Factory is not the best thing ever.  I hadn't been to one of their restaurants in a couple of years . . .  until yesterday.  It is still a great place to go with a group of people, because everyone can agree on something.  Their menus are spiral bound and have ads in them, for G-d's sake!  It's not a menu, it's a catalog!  Clearly, they have pretty much everything, since they don't subscribe to the ""do one thing and do it well"" mantra. The food here is fine.  It's not a compliment, I know, but that's exactly what it is.  OK.  Average.  Run-of-the-mill.  Decent.  In a word, fine.  My dining companion had a burger, and I had the Thai Chicken Pasta, one of my staples when I do visit The Cheesecake Factory.  As always, the portion was far too large for any normal human being, and it was actually pretty big for me as well.  The chef certainly did not skimp on the chicken breast slices, peanuts or the Thai sauce.  The bread and butter basket before the meal also filled me up. We were trying to have a nice conversation, but we were being constantly interrupted by our overly eager waiters.  Why would you interrupt someone who is clearly in the middle of the conversation?  More importantly, why would you try to rush your customers?  I saw plenty of open tables, and not too many hungry customers in waiting. The interruptions, however, did not stop with the waiter.  An elderly couple, enjoying their lunch at the adjacent table, were getting progressively more annoyed with the lack of available space on their two-top table.  After a while, they must have thought to themselves: ""we're old and we don't care.""  So, they grabbed their bread basket and set it on the corner of our four-top table.  Before I could say anything, two used bread plates made their way onto our table as well.  I really didn't know what to say or do, because I have this rule about not picking fights with men and women over 70.  I don't know, I guess that's just the way I was raised. The fact that we managed to have a wonderful time despite mediocre food, sub-par service and inconsiderate patrons is clearly a testament to my dining companion's sense of humor and patience. A word about parking: this is the WORST laid out parking lot I have ever seen.  It's basically a bunch of one-way streets, left turns and plastic barriers with far too few parking spaces sprinkled in between.  There's a tendency to over-regulate everything, but I think we can trust people to navigate a parking lot.  Can't we?   Or, is it all just an elaborate scam to get people to valet their cars for $6 a vehicle?  I am on to you, Oakridge Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=740

One day, I will take public transportation all the way from Union City just to savour the delicious morsels of food The Cheesecake Factory has to offer again. Ambiance: It has the decor of a classy restaurant and is the perfect place to take a date! I say that when it comes to the dress code, although you wouldn't get turned away for wearing sweatpants you might want to chuck on your Sunday best. Customer Service: Brilliant! The waiter was polite and courteous plus the food came out at reasonable times. Professional, quality service. Food: Even though The Cheesecake Factory looks like it will burn a hole in your wallet, the prices are actually pretty reasonable and standard - nothing different to say your neighbourhood Applebee's. Plus, the food is so AMAZING that it is worth it! I remember ordering a heavenly Smoked Salmon Bagel and I have never enjoyed a bagel more in my life. My dad dug into his Lamb Chops like it was sweet nectar from the gods themselves.

The cheesecake here came out a bit too warm(almost room temperature). It also didn't have the firmness that the good stuff has, and doesn't melt in your mouth like it should. The graham cracker crust is so thin, it's almost non existent, not thick like it should be to hold all the yummy goodness that is sweetened cream cheese.  So you get one star for making my homesickness relieve it's self a bit. The chicken stuffed tortilla...Eh, can't taste the chicken, but you can taste everything else...Had enough flavor, but doesn't hit the spot..Then again I ordered Mexican food at a suburban white persons establishment , you can find better from a taco stand.

Service here is average, the tables seem a bit cramped, and the wait for your food can be lengthy. A few pluses would be the lunch menu (with a plethora of options for under 10 dollars), the selection of iced teas, and of course, the cheesecake. The Oreo cheesecake is rich and overly sugary, but a great dessert. The chocolate raspberry truffle is pure decadence. A piece of advice -- split the cheesecake, it's a bit much for one.

Whether you come as a single, a couple, or a group, doesn't matter - there's plenty of room for everyone.  Waitstaff are dressed impeccably in white shirts, black pants and white aprons.  The decor is stylish and sophisticated. Order a delicious cocktail or wine with your meal, and begin with a thorough reading of the menu.... The menu boasts jaw dropping 10 full pages of mouth-tingling, taste-bud stimulating and mind-boggling sampling of every cuisine from around the world!!!  Talk about variety and spice!  Every cuisine imaginable is listed here.... start with some appetizers: Cuban pork mini-bites, Vietnamese Spring Rolls, or Advocado Egg rolls. Entrees are a sampling from The South, New England, Tex-mex, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, South American.  Whatever region you feel like tasting, there it is.  So, take time to read the menu and pick something you like from Louisiana Parmesan Crusted Chicken to Meatloaf.  Plenty of vegetarian selections available too. The cheesecakes.....  oh my goodness!  If you don't have the time to have a slice - take the hint -  get one and take it home with you!  CCK Factory will box your food up for take-home.  The best I've had is the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake topped with a load of whipped cream!  or splurge a little on chocolate and have the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake.  There's like 50 to choose from.   Very creamy, delectable and flavorful.  Worth the money to spend on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=800
Jennifer L.,"Cupertino, CA",69,158,8,3.0,2/18/2009,"We lucked out last night with a parking place close to the restaurant.  This was probably due to the fact that it was a) still raining a little bit; b) a Tuesday night; and c) smack dab in the middle of ski week. Usually, parking is a nightmare at this location with nearby businesses including the theaters and California Pizza Kitchen.  There is $6 valet parking, so if you are willing to fork over a little dough, you can save yourself some aggravation. Once in the restaurant, it wasn't busy at all.  (See first paragraph of this review for explanation of this.)  Usually, the wait at this restaurant is a nightmare.  You can spare yourself some aggravation by a) not going to The Cheesecake Factory; b) ordering takeout (which also takes care of the parking issue); c) arriving for dinner at around 3:30 in the afternoon. On to the food.  The portions at this restaurant are huge.  Past experience has shown that if you eat your meal first, you will never have room for dessert.  My husband's solution?  Order dessert first!  Great. /sarcasm.  Kudos to our waiter Christian for not making fun of us when we did this. My husband ordered three slices:  Oreo Cookie Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, and Mud Pie cake.  The good news is that my three stepsons joined us with their appetites.  The boys devoured the cake like army ants over a cow carcass.  I blinked and the dessert was gone.  Probably better for my waistline.   I can't tell you how the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake was.  I didn't even get a bite of that.  Curses to you, Ryan!  The Mud Pie Cake and the Chocolate Mousse cake were delicious, with the latter being my favorite: smooth, creamy and chocolaty. We didn't have huge appetites after dessert first and the little ones quickly felt the effects of our first course like a junkie who has just mainlined crank.  They were bouncing in their seats from the sugar rush. I ordered the Endive, Pear and Blue Cheese salad.  It was crisp, flavorful and delicious with lots of blue cheese and not too much dressing.  The kids split an order of sliders.  They were really greasy.  As far as sliders go, you'll do better at Chili's.   One of my stepsons ordered Rigatoni Arrabbiata.  He probably should have read the description better.  It has red pepper flakes in it and it was really spicy.  Not just spicy by his or my husband's standards (they are wimps in this regard) but spicy by my standards.  The waiter offered to correct this by putting Parmesan cheese on top.  This didn't fix it (der), so they replaced it with a less spicy version.   The other end of the table ordered chicken nachos, which were tasty.   It is a pretty rare occasion when our family decides to eat out at The Cheesecake Factory.  I think the bottom line is that the food isn't so great to make it worth the hassle and wait.  However, if you can find a time when it isn't busy, it is a perfectly decent place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=800

Melanie C.,"San Jose, CA",81,279,50,2.0,5/23/2008,"We came for mother's day.  The crowd was not too bad for brunch. As always, everything at Cheesecake Factory is overpriced.  Freaking $4 for a drink, are you kidding me? Very little here is vegetarian.  I ordered the morning quesadilla without the bacon, as that was the only ingredient that screamed meat. The server had the wherewithall to come back and ask - although it's not listed on the description for some reason, it also has chorizo.  Okay, no chorizo.  Then he comes back again.  The black beans?  They're made with chicken stock.  Come on now, is that really necessary? Alright, so he offers to replace the beans with a vegetable.  I choose the broccoli. When my entree comes, there is no broccoli to be found.  Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, but why ask about a substitute if you're not actually going to use it? I also noticed it had no ""tomato cream sauce"" as listed in the description.  I'm assuming this is because that too had chicken stock in it, but nobody said anything about it, it was just not there. The sides (guacamole, salsa, sour cream) all tasted fresh and were a nice complement to the meal.  However, they were not included in my take-home box with my leftovers!  Bummer.  This is why I prefer to box my own, thanks.  I pay that much for a meal, I want ALL of the meal. Cheesecake Factory may taste good, but it is regularly overpriced, and unnecessarily antivegetarian, so I carry a grudge.  I used to love the corn tamale appetizer until I found out those had chicken stock too, and while I don't know for sure, even the bread tasted like it had been basked with some sort of bacon juice.  At this point I'm afraid to even drink the tea.  Other restaurants kindly list which items on the menu are vegetarian or can be made vegetarian, why can't Cheesecake Factory?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=800

HOWEVER, not being hungry does not hold responsibility towards my taste buds... and all i know is: EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR DINNER SUCKED! i forced the pot stickers down just because im paying for it, and my bff couldnt even finish.. it was that bad. although it was my first time there and i shouldn't be so bias from one bad experience, it'll be pretty hard to get me to come back and dine here. dry potstickers with super salty sauce, and a waiter who dropped utensils only to pick it up and walk away pretending to get new ones when she really just reused them. ew.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=820

My boyfriend and I started off with their fried calamari it comes with this awesome cream sauce idk what it is but it was so good. Only flaw the calamari could be a bit more crispy. My boyfriend also had the potato soup, it is kind like a loaded bake potato soup, which was good but it was missing sour cream. My boyfriend got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which was good but the sauce was a bit thin for my liking. I had their ceasar salad. I love their ceasar salad and i just get the smaller portion with no chicken and I have that as my meal because it is huge and trust me I am not exaggerating. The way they make their ceasar dressing is different from any other place I have it. It is super garlicy and that is what I love most about it. And then we finished off with the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was also good but was a bit too much too handle in one sitting so we took half home, just like with our entrees. Our server was so great, I did not get her name, but she is one of the few servers that treated me and boyfriend with actual customer service which we really do not get much because we are young and servers usually assume we won't tip.

Tran M.,"San Jose, CA",111,31,8,1.0,2/22/2010,"I've been going to The Cheesecake Factory  in Valley Fair for a long time and usually leave very satisfied with the food and service. Sunday night was my little cousin's birthday and he wanted to go there for their infamous cheesecakes.  Since this one is a bit closer to my house compared to the one in Valley Fair, I decided to check it out. It took about 40 minutes for us to be seated and we were told it would take half the time. They didn't even give me the device thingy so I kept coming back and forth asking if our table were ready. Once we were seated, drinks and bread were quickly served (That's what the 1/2 star is for, though the white bread were stale ). I told them it was my cousin's birthday so we're gonna get some cheesecake afterward. The first waiter seemed nice and clear (another 1/2 star) . Then the food came out and everything went bad from there. My cousin's pasta with alfredo sauce from the kid's menu was way overpriced ! $6.95 for a plate of bow-tie pasta with sauce and NOTHING else! Come on, I know they're kids but kids can eat meat too! Poor little cousin. She looked really disappointed so I had to give her some chicken from my plate.  My Chicken Marsala wasn't much better. The bow-tie pasta was undercooked, chicken was not well seasoned and the whole plate just taste sooo bland that I had to request extra sauce. So being an Asian woman who was unsatisfied with her food, I attacked other people's plates and nothing were good. All the foods tasted way way WAYYYY too sweet. My boyfriend's steak from Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combination were the smallest pieces of steak I've seen. hahaha They were cute but did not taste good!  the Pasta Da Vinci were again undercooked (chicken were okay). I remember them taste way better at the one in Valley Fair.. =( Then while we were eating, our server came over and said that some other guy (forgot his name) was gonna take over. Anyways, everyone seemed to stop eating after 15 minutes (cuz the food wasn't good) and just sat there for like 15 minutes. No one cared to come and check on us or clean up our plates.  I had to flag down a different waitress who happened to walked by! It took her 5 minutes to get our waiter and it took him another 5 minutes to bring out the dessert menu. He suggested what's good for dessert, told me to think and disappeared into thin air after cleaning up our plates for another 15 minutes. Are you for real? I got angry and again flag down another waitress to bring me my bill!! She brought out the bill and left. It came out to be $152.50, 18% tip already included! (We had 2 appetizers: fried calamari and crispy crab wonton, 4 adult-sized orders and 2 orders from the kids menu for the 3 kids to share!!). Tips were $21.25. Gosh, I wished I could take it off. Anyways, back to the problem! After I signed my bill, I waited, and waited and waited.... for SOMEBODY to come over and swipe my card  so I can just LEAVE the damn place! But noooooo!!! My wish was not granted!  So finally, I had to drag my lazy butt to the counter, threw the damn bill in their face (not literally) and told them I wanted to pay for the meal! Then I angrily walked back to my table, sat down, expecting at least an apology from someone. HELL NO! I expected too much!  Another 2-3 minutes passed by and our ""nice and attentive NOT"" waiter FINALLY came over and asked me what we want for dessert! Are you KIDDING ME? Dessert? NOW? OMFG!! I wanted to slap him in the face but the bf was there so I had to be lady-like and said ""I paid already"". The waiter was shocked to hear that!! -__- He was like ""uh okay! Let me get your card!""  No apologies were ever said! From the waiter, the guy at the counter or the manager! At least they still remember my cousin's birthday so when we were about to leave, they brought out a sundae (the smallest sundae I ever seen) and sang a happy birthday song.  But that did not make feel better. I will never ever come back to this place again! I'd rather waste more gas and go to the one in Valley Fair instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=820

It was early and there were plenty of tables, but for some reason they sat us in the bar area right behind the bussing station. We got to hear servers bs with each other loudly.  Our food took a very very long time to arrive and our sever flat out disappeared after it was delivered. No one bussed our table, despite bussing staff noticing our empty plates, and no servers would look me in the eye when I tried to get their attention to help find our server.

It's a decent restaurant, no doubt, but my experience last night was sub-par. My fiancee and I showed up at 9:15 and were escorted to our table within about 5 mins. Our server showed up, greeted us politely and was quite pleasant. He got us our drinks while we decided what to have for dinner. After a few minutes he came back and we had some questions about the menu, after answer those questions and during a quick sidebar with the Missus, the server walked off and without explanation and didn't return for another five minutes, which was a bit weird. The night resumed with pretty good service, but after we finished our meal, we waited for about 20 minutes for a bill. Our server had disappeared unexpectedly, and then a hostess (I assume since she was wearing all black clothing instead of all-white) picked up the slack, she was friendly and prompt with delivering/retrieving our bill/payment, she offered us dessert and was genuinely sweet. We had noticed at this point that she had taken over for the other tables in our vicinity as well and we can only assume our server had gone on break or left for the evening.

Maybe my family is lucky but we never have to wait to long, even on this crowed day we waited only about 10 minutes. Knock on wood! The food range from delicious to mediocre. But the majority of the meals I tried have been  delicious! Food I recommend: Thai Lettuce Wraps: like a chicken taco with butter-lettuce as the wraps,it comes with 3 different sauce and moist flavorful chicken. Factory Chopped Salad -is my go to salad here, everything about it is delicious! Miso Salmon: Yummy! My only complaint is I want more of it, this dish tends to disappear the quickest! Cause its that good! Mahi Mahi Mediterranean: We were hesitant to order it, and surprisingly it was good. This dish comes with a huge potion of mash-potatoes.  Hibachi Steak: nicely marinated, and cut in the strips and cooked the way you like it. This dish also comes with a large portion of mash-potatoes, my family usually substitute one of the mash-potatoes portion, cause two portions of it is way too much. Pass on the Garlic Noodles, average compare to everything else I tried. Cheese cakes love them all!  Overall the service range from average to great! *** Manager extremely kind, there was a coupon for every $30 you spend, you get a free slice of cheese cake.

It's just a recipe to fail.  -I've had the BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP thai dish. Sometimes too spicy for me, but when not...it's got good flavors with the expected vegetables, curry, peanuts, etc over rice. -Several times I've ordered HERB CRUSTED FILET OF SALMON served over mashed potatoes with asparagus and a lemony sauce. -The BEST thing on the menu is the AVOCADO EGGROLLS--light and flaky (not greasy or tightly wrapped like other ""eggrolls"") and filled with avocado and other goodies, served with a sweet tamarind dipping sauce.  My complaints? -No kiddie menu! They have 500 pages (yes, exaggerating) of menu items, yet no kid portions/prices and no coloring crayons to entertain the younger set -I hate the ""wait by the palm tree"" queue for seating people. You get a pager, sit and wait, then get called to a wall by a palm tree and wait more, then you get seated. -The menu items are expensive (for this type of restaurant) so even though my favorite thing is the avocado eggroll appetizer, it's really not affordable to then order an entree as well.

Keith B.,"San Jose, CA",113,2,,4.0,3/10/2011,"I don't normally write reviews for places I go all the time, but I decided to write one for this cheesecake factory! I've been here quite a few times and the last time I went here recently the bread was my most favorite part of the meal. The atmosphere here is great. It is usually dimly lit like many higher end restaurants and it probably is a little more expensive than your average sit-down, but that's why you get better service and food. The prices are usually around 12-16$ per dish, but they do have cheaper dishes during lunch time around 10$. I always love getting the brown  sweet-ish tasting bread of which is still don't know the name! The waiters are always freindly enough to give me more than the usual amount when I ask for it too. I would say my favorite dishes from here are the Chicken Tacos and the Meatloaf. The meatloaf is always very juicy and the potatoes complement it perfectly along with the corn. As for the chicken tacos, they are always arranged nicely and again, the servers will give you a little bit of extra sides if you ask politely. The only thing I might criticize is the oiliness of a lot of their dishes. Sometimes you might leave with a slightly upset stomach, but that just might be because you ate too much too!

The chicken farfalle is pretty good, has this garlicky flavor to it, and u know me, love that garlic! They have alot of good appetizers here, so i come for that too...if the fire roasted artichokes are in season, that is a must for me, and my hubby always orders the fire cracker salmon rolls which are pretty bomb....they only give you like 4 pieces which i think is a lil shady, but they lay it on a pile of cabbage so i just eat that too...their beef carpaccio is good as well, i just hate how they dont ever let me order it togo...health food reasons....whatever i already hate eating in there...

Each time I have gone there (several times since I live close by), I've had horrible service.

It's conveniently attached to the mall, so you can go shopping and then have dinner. Our waiter was oblivious. He was trying to multitask by speaking the table next to us and pouring water into my glass. Epic Fail. He missed the glass completely and poured water all over my pants, and didn't realize it for a few seconds.  Another time, we came here for my friends birthday. I had to leave early (I have a child, so getting out is difficult), and I told our waitress the circumstance. I ordered the lettuce wraps (it consists of lettuce, cold vegetables, and tiny strips of chicken that take 6 minutes to grill, if that). I asked her to bring mine out right away since I was leaving soon. ONE HOUR LATER, my order comes out. I shove the food down my throat and leave, not without telling the manager my problem (she has no clue what she is doing either).  There have been several other times when my food has taken an hour to come out. This isn't Morton's steakhouse for crying out loud. It's Cheesecake factory.

Experience 2 - I ordered the louisiana chicken pasta dish and she ordered the chicken littles.  Waiter told her that she could sub her side with ""CREAMED spinach"".  Food came out and no creamed spinach, just sauted.  Told the server, and she said, ""oh, we don't have that"".  ""then why did you say you did?"", ""the kitchen doesn't even know how to make that, if you want to tell us how, i'll see if they can do it"".....""that's not gonna work, can she have fries instead?"".... a few minutes later, as we were waiting for her fries, we started to eat and as she tasted my food, I saw her pull something out of her mouth.  it was A GODDAM PIECE OF PLASTIC!!! WTF?!!!  If that was someone's kid, they could've choked on that!  Fries came out, I told the server (who was nice although she smelled like so much smoke I felt like I caught lung cancer from her) that I think it's time for me to speak with the manager.  When she went to get him, I tried the fries that she JUST brought out and they were cold!  Manager came, obviously embarrassed.  ""I'm so sorry, I heard what happened""....""yea, I think we're ready to leave"" I explained the spinach, plastic bag, and fries problems and he said, ""can I at least explain where the plastic bag came from"".....""I don't really care where it came from, I think we're ready to leave""......""can I at least make you something to take with you""....""With all that's happened so far, I don't think it'll get any better, and we don't really feel comfortable (or safe) eating here"".....""ok, I won't charge you for your meals"".....""of course you won't, cuz that wouldn't make sense"".  He actually did handle it really well and after refusing his offer of a gift card, we left. Experience 3 - It had been a few months and I was craving a damn burger, so we decided to give them another chance.  Waited 45 minutes to be seated.  We ordered clam chowder and TexMex Eggrolls.  Clam chowder was fine, but the eggrolls were cold.  probably because theywere sitting there for 1/2 hour while after we ordered (total time so far 1 1/2 hours).  about 20 minutes later, my Well done Kobe Burger came, but her Ahi Carpachio didn't.  So We waited....and waited.....and waited.   The waiter (who was very good at his job) noticed I was getting really annoyed, so he brought the manager without me asking.  Manager apologized and I asked him why a RAW dish is taking longer than a WELL DONE dish?  he said that if we wait a little longer it'll be there.  ""WE'VE BEEN HERE 2 HOURS ALREADY!!""......""i apologize, and I promise i'll make it up to you"".  Fish came out a few minutes later (total time 1 hour 55 minutes).  They comp'd desert, but that wasn't enough to make up for them dropping the ball.   Staff is good here, management is good, kitchen needs a suprise visit from the health inspector to get them back on track and paying attention, and their procedures need an internal audit with some better organization.  Won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=920

Most evenings, this place is really packed and it can take anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes to get a seat. Since I usually go as part of a pair, we get seated in those really awkward two-tops that has a bench seat and a normal chair. I hate how close you end up sitting to the table next to you. Regardless, the service here has been pretty good. There was only one time where the service was excruciatingly slow (it took about an hour to get our food). We talked to the waiter and manager, and managed to at least get some free cheesecake out of the deal. Additionally, the food here has been pretty good. However, I recommend AGAINST getting the Pasta Di Vinci. It was extremely disappointing with nearly no chicken in the dish.

In the end, I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was surprisingly really tasty. The chicken cutlets were thin and crispy, the farfalle was cooked perfectly, and the spicy sauce was yummy.

It took her a long time to get our order. When we ordered drinks, she forgot my friend's wine not once, but twice. We had to ask her about it, then when she came back to our table she said she had forgotten about it. Instead of getting the wine after that, she attends to the table next to us. We were there first and why is it that she got all of their stuff in a very timely manner? I could understand that it's the holidays, but it wasn't even busy when we were there. The food we got was really good though, so I am happy about that. I couldn't finish everything-as everyone knows, they serve big portions. When I got my food boxed, I had asked if I could have more buffalo wing sauce since I only had a tiny bit left and a lot of food leftover. She said sure but when I ate my leftovers later at home, she didn't even give me more sauce. Instead, she poured the few drops (less than what I had) into a small plastic container. Pathetic!

With the exception of ONE instance, I have always had very poor service at Cheesecake factory.  The hosts/hostesses are always rude.  The restaurant is not designed for good line of sight to your waiter/ress, and the waiter/ress has the same problem with not being able to meet thier tables needs due to ill line of sight.  The design is cute and fancy and all, but makes for a tough time serving well - and they always seem to be serving tables ALL over the restaurant, making it even more difficult to focus on all of thier customers.   The food is usually very good, and in large portions.  They may be pricey, but the portions pretty much make up for that.  A $12 meal at Cheesecake can easily be made into two meals.

It's cool it's new years eve. Standing room only waiting for the beeper to go off, but good company made up for it. Seated and was promptly take care of by an amazing server, ""Rod"". Then ""Rod"" went on break leaving ""Steve"" in charge of our table. Our food arrived and one of the people in our party wanted soy sauce and didn't get it. Our drinks ran dry. Where was Steve? Steve was no where to be seen? Steve? Steve was in ""his"" section on the other side of the restaurant. Finally, 15 minutes past and everyone had pretty much finished our did ""Steve"" show up. Water came. Soy sauce came, but Management shouldn't have left our table in the care of someone that already had another area and was too busy to take care of us. Food was amazing.

E G.,"San Jose, CA",38,94,1,4.0,2/13/2008,"Oh, Cheesecake Factory... how you do me wrong with fattening yumminess, but it always feels so right. I like coming here to meet up with friends for dinner. It's got a nice atmosphere, although it always seems to be pretty noisy no matter what time of day it is. I always find the waiters to be friendly and attentive. I've never had to wait long for a refill or any other request. For drinks I get the Red Raspberry Martini. Delicious! As for the food, I usually start off with the Avocado Eggrolls. The dipping sauce really brings it together. I've found through trial and error that my favorite dish is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. I just love the stuff the chicken is crusted in! I also like their mashed potatoes. And for cheesecake, my favorite is the Tiramisu. Yum! All in all, 4 stars because even though I love the food, it's always so noisy that I feel like I need to shout across the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=940
Kristen K.,"San Jose, CA",126,63,49,4.0,8/15/2006,"I go here for the food, not the cheesecake.  The cheesecake is too sweet for my taste.  I'd rather have strawberry shortcake or tiramisu, or just a goblet of strawberries with whipped cream (the real thing, not the stuff out of a can, and not overly sweet).  Everything I've had has been really good.  I usually get one of the many chicken dishes (chicken piccata, Louisiana chicken pasta, chicken and biscuits, chicken Costoletta), I've also had shrimp, fish, shepherd's pie, Chinese chicken salad. They also have the best strawberry lemonade.  I try to avoid it elsewhere because it will be a disappointment.  I have a friend who I know would give it 5 stars.  He says it's the most favorite restaurant anywhere.  I really like it too, but it's not my most favorite restaurant.  It's always crowded, though I find the Oakridge location a bit less crowded than at Valley Fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=940
Angie L.,"San Jose, CA",90,77,,3.0,3/18/2012,"I'm not really a fan of big chain restaurants that serve up thousand calorie gluttonous platters of food; however, I was quite excited to give this place a try after hearing all of the rave reviews from regulars. I've ordered several cheesecakes from here throughout the years for birthdays, but finally came by for dinner with my husband and daughter. The service was excellent, surprisingly so, on a Saturday night that was super busy. The waitress, who was very friendly and attentive, immediately came to our table with water, bread, coloring stuff, and a little fruit & bread plate for our daughter. We ordered a couple cocktails, the ahi carpaccio, crab cakes, chicken madeira, and hibachi steak. The ahi carpaccio was outstanding...I could eat several plates of that in one sitting. Although the portions were huge (we had a lot of food to take home), everything else tasted pretty mediocre.

I wouldn't call it a special place but it is quite convenient with a LOT of options. I dont typically get their dessert as I know they are all very fattening but they have lunch size portions which will already fill you up. They expanded their menu with small bites which allow you try try different things without over ordering which is good.

Minus one star for bland quesdilla, minus one for bland salsa, minus one for brown avcados and minus two for awfully greasy pizza that didn't taste like anything. The grease was literally pooled on the pizza and I had to take my napkin and soak it off. Unless you like your pizza that greasy, I'm sorry but thats just nasty.

They remade it for her, but they acted like they were going out their way for her.

Coco V.,"Monterey, CA",1,16,,2.0,9/9/2010,"Met my dad and his friend here for lunch. The most impressive thing about this place was the attitude of the staff. The bartender, the host and our server were all outstandingly friendly and accommodating. The food was not so impressive. My chicken tostada salad was a huge double mound of shredded lettuce over two stale shells. I had to play needle in a haystack to find the three small bites of chicken. Basically boring & flavorless. All that dry romaine would make a rabbit very happy, but it left me feeling hungry for another entree. My dad reported his chicken picatta was so-so, and the third in our party enjoyed every bite of his orange chicken with white rice. For dessert I opted for the plain & simple cheesecake - quite good, although still a bit frozen in the center. The strawberry shortcake, well, simply fell short.

They don't take call in nor reservation. So, if you want dinner without the wait, try take-out. Call and order on the phone.

Now, my son comes home from Marine boot camp and announces he wants to eat out EVERY NIGHT until he goes back and has this list of restaurants to go to, Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge being one of them. Ok. I get the award for the most easy-going, well-rounded mom in the world (no pun intended).So, we go.  Now, I know I wrote a not-too-sterling review of the Valley Fair location because, well, basically it sucked. I have to say, if you are going to eat here, do not consume any other food for a whole 24 hours before hand. The menu has ""ads"" (I kid you not) and is the size of Glen Ellen's phone book. I get a little confused with so many choices...must be my age and the diet food. But, I finally settled on an appetizer of corn cakes with a salsa on it and it was delicious! My son had fish and chips and I still can't believe he ate the whole thing as well as an oreo cheesecake chocolate dessert. I had one bite of that dessert and gained 5 pounds on the spot. The service was pretty good too. They loose some points for the garish decor (like some midwest stencil queen you see on access tv  gone wild) and the ads in the menu.

The cheese on the sandwich was cold and the meat wasn't even hot..  I hope whoever is the manager for this Cheesecake Factory should train the waiter/waitress/hostess to provide good customer service and also, he/she wants to rethink about hiring a new chef...  The food sucks so bad that I couldn't even finish 1/4 of the platee.  I hope that whoever receive this message learn how to manage this restaurant because words travel about the reputation of this restaurant..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=960
