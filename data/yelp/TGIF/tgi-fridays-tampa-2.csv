Robbie B.,"Westchase, FL",6,39,12,1.0,4/16/2015,"sad, because the server could of given two sh$ts about our concerns and questions. Wont be returning their ever again. Anyone can get food, takeout and great dining, but when it comes to service you want to be appreciated and welcomed. This is worst Fridays I have been to, Majorly needs a staff overhaul! Herb crusted chicken was dry, the server said it was supposed to be that way. I come from Detroit and there is a awesome Fridays on Vandyke and 14mile, that gets the herb crusted chicken perfectly, it's moist and has more Parmesan creaminess to it, unlike this crap in a bucket! If you are going to order here, order takeout and avoid the crappy service. Other wise Chili's would be your best bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20
Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",848,2344,2391,3.0,4/3/2014,"Visited here the other day,  Stopped to get food after the Doctor's visit, after finding out that the husband was indeed sick. So we opted to get him some hot soup and me a burger.   Their food is consistently mediocre, not AAHHHMAZING and certainly not terrible, but they do offer something I've not seen anywhere else, Bacon Mac & cheese balls! Now those were tasty! The soup was good, the burger, well, I take them apart and just eat the protein and veg. So it really would behoove me to order it that way ratehr than waste the bread, perhaps one day i'll do that.  The waitress we had was excellent though.

Mark H.,"Elfers, FL",61,1531,5409,3.0,12/15/2012,"Good mojitos and the Cobb salad is on point for the price.  Turkey burger could use a little work though.  It's a little ""gamey"" upon first bite.  However, the regular burger is flame-grilled, juicy and for $9, a pretty decent sandwich for a chain. Also, give the fried cheese sticks a whirl.  I found them quit comforting. Not sure what else to write about; it's a chain with edible food.  =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20
Laural Elayne D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",12,6,,1.0,5/14/2016,This place smells terrible. I'm pretty sure it's just full of mold or something equally gross. Our server was not very friendly at all.

Michael V.,"Oldsmar, FL",0,3,,1.0,7/17/2015,"Went to the Hillsborough Ave location on a Thursday night about 7:30 pm to have a few beers and the ""endless apps"" with my son. We walked in and the place felt warm- not sure is AC was not working properly or what. We sat in the bar area and several high top tables were dirty-had to have hostess wipe off. The endless apps promo is back but with restrictions. You can only order 1 type of app per person and cannot mix and match- really? Who wants to eat the same thing over and over? Might be ok in large group so you can share but this was obviously a corporate move to save money. Rather not even have the offer in the first place. We put in the order for first 2 and was told the second round was also ""put in"" but took forever to get food. Evidently ours was delivered to another table- new food runners they said. When it finally came we had to hunt down someone for silverware and plates. Beers were expensive- over 5$ for a Sam Adams draft and not even a true pint glass- really? ""Happy hour all day at Friday's""""......not so much. Very disappointed with entire visit-typical chain restaurant, will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20

Scott H.,"Clearwater, FL",129,187,230,3.0,6/7/2014,"I stopped in for lunch and it was a positive experience.  Because I was during a lunch break I was in a time crunch; so when I did not see a hostess promptly I went to the bar which had plenty of seating.  The bar areas was very large and had sports bar feel but not overdone. The servers were prompt and very friendly. Moods come and go so I wanted something healthy.   I found the menu offered various options in this regard.  I believe compromised with a turkey burger and fries.  The burger was very rich in flavor and came topped with lettuce, tomato, and onion.  It was very good size burger and took two hands.  The fries were hot and lightly salted. Lunch was satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20

Maurice B.,"Silver Spring, MD",210,4,,2.0,4/10/2016,"I have been to this Fridays several times and have a great experience, but this time the one thing that made my experience bad was the fact that I originally wanted a strawberry / lemonade crush, but the waitress advised me it wasn't any refills because it had real fruit in it.  I was a little confused being that I get that all the time.  So I decided to ask for a Coke, when she came back I said what happen to the strawberry/ lemonade drink that had the crush Ice in it.  She advised we have that and that's the one with the free refills. I finished my coke, she asked would you like the strawberry / lemonade I said yes.  When I received my check I was shocked to see I was charged for a Coke and Strawberry / Lemonade.  If she would have informed me it was going to be an extra 3.39 added to my bill I would have declined and just got another coke.  I just think it was very deceiving to just add another drink on the bill and not let the patron know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20

Jeff E.,"Tampa, FL",15,73,11,4.0,11/12/2012,"This restaurant is very near to where I live. Its usually a last resort option when I want to go out, but please don't let that be an indication of the food quality. Fridays has your typical American style cuisine, but  they go out of their way to put interesting little twists on it. I had korean tacos recently, and was amazed that not only were they serving something along the lines of Korean tacos, but the flavor that they managed to capture with the spices. Fridays has done a wonderful job of reinvograting their restaurants. This specific location also has fairly good service. While it can become a little hectic, the servers generally do a great job. The servers are also very good at  suggesting different food items.  The restaurant is clean and is up kept very well. I am actually borderline on rating this store a 5 star, but don't just because several times there have been one or two mistakes on orders or food not coming out completely correct. Over all though, this is a great restaurant and I recommend it to everyone",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=20

Overheard and waiter saying food shouldn't be that much longer. Most of the employees were cleaning tables and ignoring customers. I have been here on busy nights and the service was night and day. We glanced over the menu and still were not greeted by any wine so decided to get up and leave. We don't anticipate waiting that long to get service when we go out to eat.

Jennifer G.,"Clearwater, FL",0,249,93,3.0,11/2/2013,"This Friday's location is very disappointing to me. We used to have one closer in Countryside but they closed up quite awhile ago and now we have to drive to Tampa. The last 3 times we have been here the service is terrible. The last time my chicken in my cajun pasta was still pink and the manager had to take it back. I of course did not want it anymore after that. We used to go to Friday's on holidays too. Christmas was always crowded but great. This is no longer the case. We also went there last Christmas to this same location and it was terrible. I cannot judge a restaurant that I have patronized so many years over a holiday disaster. We chose to go back again. Again we were disgusted. So, we have now decided to give them another try, it had been awhile and hey, they deserved another try, right? NOT! What a joke, they must have poor management or something because you can't get service to save your life. The spinach dip appetizer was overcooked and dry. The chips were stale. We attempted to tell the server who just rolled her eyes and walked away. She never returned again until we were finished with our dinner. Literally, we had to flag down someone else when the chicken in my pasta was under cooked. I have a substantial amount of rewards even built up on my card and could easily get a free entree if I went back. That will not be happening. I think we are finished giving TGI Friday's anymore breaks. It is a bit of a drive for us since Clearwater closed and to drive to have a horrible experience time and again is not worth it to me. I guess its just another dying chain, so sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tampa-2?start=40
