Lissa E.,"Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom",182,102,639,3.0,3/20/2016,"It's a TGI Fridays, I'm pretty sure you know what to expect! Service is hit or miss - on this occasion it was pretty damn good! Our waitress was attentive and friendly, and kept bringing refills of the bottomless fountain drinks before glasses were anywhere near empty. The food today was good - I think the key with TGI is what you order. Avoid the dry, overcooked burgers (such a shame that a chain specialising in 'American' food can't cook a decent burger!). They've recently revamped their menu. The new pork belly appetizer with red cabbage slaw is lovely, and the new main course version of the Jack Daniels crispy chicken strips is huge. We also tried the cajun chicken tostados - decent but a little dry, it could have done with more sauce and/or some soured cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kent
Jodie O.,"London, United Kingdom",48,163,43,3.0,6/17/2012,"Stuck in Bluewater due to some sorta traffic thing, me and a friend decided to park the car back up and go have a few drinks (I wasn't driving!) and some food. There were huge queues everywhere, but TGIs had a bar, so we decided to eat there. Good points: staff are very helpful, our server was lovely. Food is huge and was hot. We were not rushed to leave even though it was very busy. Bad points: it's a little bit expensive (nachos being £9, burger £11). Cocktails didn't taste too great.  Overall it was enjoyable, but that might be more so because of the company I was with. I will visit again in a few months. Because I do love a good burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kent
Leon C.,"Norwich, United Kingdom",692,1003,700,3.0,12/12/2008,"When this bar/restaurant first opened, the staff in true American service style were completely insane. The waiters/ess would sing and dance and occasionally run off with your table. Or they'd balance your food on their heads and bring it to the table.  The bartenders were even worse and it was amazing to watch the guys spinning and throwing bottles to each other at break neck speeds.  Although it has calmed down quite a bit over the last eight years a couple of the old school bartenders are still there.  If you are looking for a great night, Friday's and Saturday's are busy and fun with plenty of girls and boy to flirt with. Tell Darrel or Frodo you want to have a good time and they will instruct you on exactly what drinks to have. The food is hearty and tasty but a little pricey. If you want to embarrass someone on their birthday take them here. Not only will the staff stand the birthday girl/boy on a chair, they will sing to them and encourage the entire restaurant to join in.  TGI Fridays Bluewater is rip-roaring fun for kids and adults alike. Well worth checking out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kent
