Barbara M.,"Jersey City, NJ",105,387,332,4.0,12/23/2016,I had an excellent experience dealing with the to go people of the Applebee's restaurant in Audubon New Jersey. The young man at the register was so pleasant and kind. He took care of her order even telling us what time it would be precisely when it would be completed. He also helped with getting some additional dressing for our salads. He was just professional and pleasant.   In terms of the food you know it's Applebee's. My mother enjoyed her Southwestern chicken salad. And the club sandwich I ordered while sort of saturated with mayo it was still OK. All the staff there that I interacted with for that time was great. Customer service means a lot to me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4

Aliyah M.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"My brother and cousin took me out to eat at this Applebee's. We were there to have a fun time, since I hardly ever see them. Our interaction with our waiter was immediately negative. The waiter asked to see ID's in the most rude way and my cousin laughed it off by saying all of our ages and said that I was his mom, jokingly. Our waiter then said ""Oh I feel bad for you"". I kept my cool and didn't not reciprocate a negative comment. Then throughout the dinner he would not come when we pushed the button and joked about it when he got to our table. And when he took my ID to check it and he asked me every question possible and I guess he was doing the math that I am 26yrs old, my cousin the  said that my Id is fake. He then said that he had the right to not serve me alcohol because of that comment, which I have never heard of and I too was a waitress for years. And he warned my cousin right in front of me about that comment. The most horrible service I've ever had and I don't even look for much at franchise restaurants and he was below those standards. Great atmosphere and okay food, again it's a franchise. Will never go back again and that waiter is lucky that my brother and cousin even paid and tipped him. I would have not tipped him and talked to the manager because his actions were completely unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4
Nadaya O.,"Woodbury, NJ",1,1,,1.0,10/26/2015,Visited yesterday and while I love applebee's this place and service just wasn't right! My server was pleasant and that was about it! She bought my son's kids meal out timely and my salad and for the the rest of my order I waited damn near a half hour! When it finally came my son had no cheese on his cheese burgers and I ordered the blackened tilapia and did not get one of two sides. Once I finally got my side I noticed a piece of hair in my veggies (eww) sent it back waited some more so now it took just about an hour for my meal to come full circle! I would recommend that any waitress be detail oriented and have knowledge of the menu! The kitchen staff needs training in sanitation. They get an A for being pleasant but that is it!!!! Still love applebee's though!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4
Jay D.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",188,78,18,1.0,11/10/2013,"We ordered online for take-out at this Applebees, as we wanted to watch the NFL games at home.  I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwhich, while my girlfriend ordered a salad.  We also ordered the appetizer sampler, to split while we watched the NFL games all afternoon. We went to the Applebees at the pickup time, and were basically ignored for about 5 minutes or so.  We were then told that someone would be ""right with us"" to handle our order.  ""Erin K"" was this individual, and took her time getting back to us. We went home, and opened up our dishes to notice the following: The appetizer was missing the quesadilla, which is a third. The salad did not include the dressing. The silverware was not included, despite saying it would be on our receipt. Obviously, this shows in lack in verifying details.  In my opinion, Erin K should have checked our order before handing it over to make sure everything was accounted for.  Or maybe my expectations for what constitutes good customer service is too high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4
Caitlin C.,"Collingswood, NJ",86,151,85,4.0,3/8/2014,"I find myself coming to this Applebee's every so often. It's really not so bad and I don't think it deserves to have such a low rating.  They have a ton of seating and you never have to wait too long, even when it's busy.  The food is consistently good.  The only thing holding me back from five stars is the hit or miss service.  Give this Applebee's a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4
Frank B.,"Atlantic City, NJ",6,58,2,1.0,8/19/2014,"If eating high calorie heavily salted saturated fat food that will give you nightlong gastric distress and a horrible case of diarrhea, then the Audubon Applebee's is for you. If not, avoid at all cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4
G. Y.,"Audubon, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2/15/2015,Went there about a Month ago. It was the worst food I ever ate. The burger was burnt to a crisp. The wings were so greasy that they slipped out of my hands. The mozzarella sticks were burnt to the point where there was no cheese in them. I will never return there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4
Lorna F.,"Allentown, PA",20,34,,1.0,1/18/2010,"I debated between 1 star or 2 stars.  I figure a one star rating would mean I would have conviction to NEVER return again (over my dead body.)  I'm not sure I care to have that kind of conviction about Applebees, but the one star description is ""Eek!.""  Eeek about sums it up. I cannot understand why people choose to go to Applebees.  There are so many other option in the area. The only appetizer option that is not fried is the spinach and artichoke dip.  And really it was not very good.   We went to Applebees because we figured they would have nice big salads.  Well, they have salads, but they had none that I would choose to eat.  The only non-meat salad option was shrimp, but they had bacon on that salad.   So, instead, I chose a bbq shrimp dinner.  It was spicy, but not in a good way.  It was spicy in a ""I now cannot taste anything because this spice is smothering, not enhancing, my food."" We were rushed out of our table, understandable, because there were at least 15 people waiting for a table.  When we left, the wait was 25 minutes.  I cannot fathom why anyone would wait 25 minutes to eat here.  It must be the half priced fried food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-audubon-4
