24,Amanda H.,"Lansdale, PA",7,52,2.0,2.0,2012-01-05,"Go to the one on Knapp Road and 309, the service is way way better. Went in there for dinner, and it was busy for 9PM on a Tuesday, but not busy enough for the poor service we received. Sat at the bar, and was given menus and drink orders were taken by a girl, but then 5 minutes later, she told a guy, who was the actual bartender what our order was, and he made my drink, while the manager asked my boyfriend what he was drinking (he had to repeat this 3x to three different people). We had to wait about 10 minutes to order food, because the bartender was apparently expected to tend bar as well as serve tables around the bar. We ordered the Sizzlin' 'Nawlins Skillet, with Potato Twisters as an app. The bartender said the twisters would be out in 5 minutes. In this time, my friend came to meet us, and she had to wait 10 minutes just to order a drink! Then she ordered a side caesar with spinach and extra dressing on the side, and the chicken quesadillas, just chicken and cheese.  I took about 25 minutes for us to get our food, and the appetizer came out literally right before the entrees. Then the manager brought out the onions and peppers that were supposed to be on the skillet separate, cause they forgot to put them on. The appetizer was warm, like it had been sitting waiting to be brought out for a while, We had to eat the entrees first, because they were hot. The rice underneath was undercooked, some were still hard, but the shrimp, chicken and andioulle sausage was good. My friend on the other hand, wasn;t so lucky. Her quesadillas had some weird sauce on them, and she didn't like them at all. She told the bartender, and he walked away before she could ask him for silverware. She had to eat her salad with her fingers until the manger came out, about 10 minutes later. He was nice about it, and got her silverware, which she unwrapped to find FOOD STUCK TO THE TINES OF THE FORK! She then had to wait another 10 minutes for another fork, because the bartender was off playing waiter. They also didn't put any dressing on the salad, only gave her the normal amount of dressing on the side.  I like to sit at the bar in restaurants like Applebees because the service is usually better and there is no wait. I got there at 9:30 ish, and didn't get out of there until almost 11:40!  I do have to say that I don't feel like this was the bartender's fault, he was obviously overloaded, he had a full bar plus 3-4 tables around the bar, which was way to much for one person, especially when there was 2 hostesses standing at the hostess stand and the manager was just milling around. Just go to Knapp Road if you want Applebees and don't have 2+ hours to sit around and wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3?start=20,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248
25,Robert B.,"Souderton, PA",9,28,15.0,2.0,2012-06-02,The server had a playboy bunny necklace. The host station was more like a gossip station. No one was paying attention to the customers. It took over 10 minutes to get a child's milkshake. My meal was served 5 minutes after the rest of my family's was. And a Pepsi is $2.69! I can buy 2 two liters for that price. Totally not worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3?start=20,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003
22,Edward P.,"West Chester, PA",5,92,18.0,1.0,2012-12-30,"While they call this a neighborhood bar and resturant. I definitely do not feel this Applebees is neighborly.  Of all the chain bar/ resturants including other Applebees locations, this Applebees is by far the worst.  The bartender constantly tried to upsell me and I feel like I am at a used car dealership than a bar. I shouldn't have to be forced to buy special promos that were being hosted by Applebees or food when I am not hungry.

27,Kelly W.,"Lansdale, PA",1,28,,3.0,2013-03-09,"My boyfriend and I went here and it was way to pack, not even a space in the entire lot 9:30pm on a Friday. So we went back home and ordered Carside To Go. We got the boneless hot wings, 7oz. house sirloin with veggies & mashed potatoes, and the Bourbon Street chicken & shrimp with fried red potatoes off the 2 for $20 menu they said 20 to 25 minutes. They didn't ask us what kind of vehicle we had or anything so when we pulled up and parked in the allotted Carside To Go spaces and no one came out I had to go in to pick up the food. I have to say that was the only bad part about the visit. We got our food it was hot and ready to go as we ordered it. Then entrees we got were really tasty and filing! We will go back for Carside To Go next time we choose Applebees!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3?start=20,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
14,Kunal P.,"North Wales, PA",52,174,26.0,3.0,2013-05-08,"By far one of the better experiences at a chain restaurant of recent. The place was absolutely packed when we went there.  But, luckily, we didn't have to wait more than 2 minutes.  Our server was very courteous - which I've seen very rarely at chain restaurants. As far as the food goes, my wife was really satisfied.  And that's all that matters. We'd definitely go back, if not for the food, for the friendly service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3,,,,,
21,Nancy A.,"Hatfield, PA",3,14,,3.0,2013-06-19,"The last time I went to Applebees, I got cold rice and the service wasn't great. This time completely made up for it.  When we arrived it looked like a slow lunch Saturday which was pretty cool. The hostess looked a little tired, but was polite. The waitress we had was incredible, she wasn't checking in every five seconds or lingering too long. We talked to the manager about how good the service was and the food was pretty good too.  I had their new American BLT Sandwich (or something sort of by that name) and it was really really good. Not too much butter, the bread wasn't soggy, and it wasn't burnt. The fries were lukewarm, but they were still really good. I didn't realize that the Cherry Pepsi they had, actually had real cherries on top. That was a very pleasant surprise.  I'd definitely go back. The atmosphere was good, the people were friendly, the food was delicious, and it was all at a good price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3?start=20,,,,,
28,Don W.,"Lansdale, PA",0,29,,4.0,2013-08-31,I only give this place 4 stars because they have some decent meals that are not too fattening.  But I have to suffer through the corporate programmed waiters always trying to up-sell me. The food is generally OK.  Somewhere I read they use a lot of frozen stuff. Bottom line is that I don't go here very often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3?start=20,,,,,
18,Lori R.,"Harleysville, PA",0,1,,1.0,2014-03-15,"Luckily for this Applebees, there are few other restaurants in this area to eat at.  I usually enjoy eating at most Applebees but the service here tends to fall off unless you get a more seasoned waiter/waitress to serve you. The hostess stand is probably the worst part of the whole experience and is run by a clan of unprofessional young kids who care more about socializing and eating candy out of the stand than how long it takes to seat you.   The food is usually subpar as well and unless you have time to wait another 20 minutes for them to make you another meal, you're stuck with rock hard chicken fingers for your meal.  And when the manager comes around to ask if everything tasted ok at the end of the meal and you give them an honest answer they look confused. You can skip this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3,,,,,

16,Rich K.,"Lansdale, PA",0,29,8.0,3.0,2014-11-15,"Just what you would expect from an Applebee's.  Good food at a good price. My only issue was the waitress.  She was horrible. She forgot I ordered a refill for about 20 min till I reminded her, was totally unattentive and I had to use the little tablet on the table to order dessert otherwise I would have never got it.

19,Ken M.,"Harleysville, PA",0,1,,1.0,2015-01-09,"The food is mediocre. No matter how many times I've been here they always fail to get my order correctly. I always ask for BBQ boneless wings in the side and they always take the bone out and don't leave the bones on the side. they always do this and always manage to screw the easiest request up.

13,Sgt. T.,"Harleysville, PA",0,12,,1.0,2015-01-10,"I don't know how effective this review will be because i left the restaurant before actually suffering through the food. We sat down and ordered drinks, an iced tea for my wife and a chocolate milkshake for me.  Looking over the menu we noticed that many of the dinners were in cream sauces and if you have read any of my other reviews then you know my wife has a dairy allergy.  So we ask The waitress, who clearly wanted to be anywhere but serving tables, if sauces could be substituted and she says she will ask the manager. 10 mins later she returns and tells us the manager said there could be no substitutions and we would just have to order from what was shown. Frustrated but hungry my wife orders a garden salad and i get the sampler.  I cant tell you if they were good because at that point i looked down at the milkshake i was drinking to see a booger on the side of the glass. Sure you can argue like the manager did and say it was whip cream but i have a 2 year old son and i could see plain as day the green and yellow nightmare on my glass.  On top of that i complained about her refusing food allergy substitutions and she said that the waitress had never come to her... Liars. Wy wife and i left and got Popeye's takeout instead. I suggest you do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3,,,,,

10,Amy A.,"North Wales, PA",5,11,,1.0,2016-06-16,"Applebee's..I have REALLY tried to like your establishment, but I just can't do it! I have been to your restauarant several times because my kids really like it. I've yet to figure out why..Every single time we go there is an issue.Tonight we went there to grab a quick bite and relieve me from having to cook dinner after a long hard day. Our waiter was smiling and friendly. He came to take our drink order and when he brought me my wine both the carafe and wine glass were dirty. And I mean DIRTY!!!. We sat by a window with the light shining in, so every speck of dirty stuck food? grime? could be seen, stuck to the glass. I pointed it out to the waiter and he graciously gave me a new one in a clean glass and carafe and apologized. Kids could not decide what they wanted tonight so we opted for the build your own sample with a max of 5. Two house salads, one chicken quesadilla, pretzel with cheese dip and the wonton tacos. Our order came in record time but we were provided no utensils nor plates. When the runner came with the last dish, I asked for sour cream, utensils and plates. She came back in short order dumped some utensils and left. To my unpleasant surprise, the silverware we were left was just as if not more dirty than my wine glass. Riddled with spots and crusty old food. EW!!!! Our waiter, once smiley and welcoming was no where to be found. I flagged down the host who had just seated a table and asked for more silverware. He brought it. Then our waiter appeared and again apologized stating he ""didn't know why someone brought us dirty silverware"". As he turned to leave us, I asked AGAIN for some plates. He returned, dumped the plates and walked away. As I started to pass out the plates to my kids, i noticed that the plates ALSO were filthy. Spotted and old crusty (food?) stuck to it. At this point I had it. I gathered my children and ushered them out of this disgusting establishment to the car. I approached the hostess stand and requested a manager who did not seem very expedient to meet with me as I stood there waiting to explain why we were leaving in such haste. As she approached (no smile, no welcome, no intro) I asked, are you the manager to which she stated YES. I explained to here that in the 20 min or so that we were there we were served dirty, disgusting table ware THREE TIMES and that i would NEVER return to this unsanitary establishment. She stood there looking at me blankly. I turned and left. What an utter disappointment. What a disgusting experience. I am in shock at how non nonchalantly your dirty establishment treated me and my family",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3,,,,,

Standing in front of the host podium, waiting to be seated. Hosts are chatting back and forth for a while, neither acknowledging us. Two men walk in after a couple of minutes and are immediately welcomed and seated. I ask the host if he saw us waiting and he ignores my question. After he seats the two men, I ask again if he saw me waiting there in front of him, he continues to ask how many in my party - Refusing to answer my question and rolling his eyes. I ask to speak to the Manager. He gets her and she seats us with no explanation as to why we were bypassed and my question rudely ignored. She offers us a free appetizer, to make me stop talking, which does not make up for the disrespect which we were given.  As a result we will not eat here anymore. The one in N.

9,Lauren W.,"Harleysville, PA",34,15,,2.0,2016-11-22,"While our waiter was attentive and apologetic for our poor experience, this Applebee's needs to step up their game. Our order consisted of $85 of alcohol, apps and steaks all ordered rare. It took over an hour and 15 minutes for our steaks to be delivered. All were overdone; brown in color and tough to chew. The manager of the restaurant delivered new steaks and asked us if ""these was better?"" The 2nd steaks were an identical copy to the 1st steaks. We stated to the manager ""no, these are still overdone."" The manager then stated ""So, that color of red is not to your liking?"" At this point, we were frustrated with the rude comment but agreed to keep the 2nd steaks as we were hungry and it was getting late. We then requested the check. An $8 discount was applied to the bill. However, given the experience, we stated that we felt the discount was unfair. The manager came over and stated ""Oh, so my discount not high enough for you?"" We were appalled by the comment; it was distasteful to say the least! I strongly feel the manager should have handled every part of our experience differently. She should be able to recognize issues within the kitchen. Also, speak to your customers with respect! The comment: ""Oh, so my discount not high enough for you?"" really sent me over the edge and left such a sour taste in my mouth. Finally, if any part of the experience is poor, the manager should provide an apology. Were in no rush to come back, plenty of restaurants worth visiting for better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3,,,,,

This is one of the ""Bowl"" meals, as it comes in a large bowl, all one on top of the other (potatoes under, thick breaded chicken filet on top of that, brown gravy next, and topped with thin sliced battered onion rings).  Oh, if you don't say no, you get it with cheese on top of the chicken filet-which is how I had it the first time, and I thought it didn't need it, so next time I asked for no cheese.  My wife likes the cheese, so you may too. One of the best tasting and satisfying meals out that I have had in a long, long time.  The portion is large, so if you don't take leftovers home, you might be pretty full if you try to eat it all.  We like leftovers though! One suggestion-a side of vegetables would be nice, or a small side salad to break the richness and monotony of a limited course meal like this.  But hard to find a better warming comfort food if you like fried chicken though!  Enjoy! We really liked our waitress too, think it was The Amazing Amey, as the manager touted her, and she was amazing!  Service with a smile and nothing left to chance with her.  Thank you Amey!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lansdale-3,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

I arrived here a few months ago with my family, and the place was packed. I called ahead and when I arrived was still given a wait time.  The food was good, but I could tell through the years that their appetizer portions have been shrinking. I remember the spinach and artichoke dip use to be in a huge saucer with a handle and now is only in a small ramekin like dish. Chips were really salty.  The create your own deal with meat and veggies has a great selection. My brother and dad got chicken topped with shrimp and broccoli and mashed potatoes. My dad is picky about going out to eat but when he discovered this meal option he's become a monthly regular. My boyfriend got the fish and chips, the fish was kinda bland and unseasoned.
