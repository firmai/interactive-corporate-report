Maria Y.,"Seattle, WA",64,262,72,2.0,6/24/2012,"This place is just.... not good. I am not opposed to chain restaurants, because while they are usually not particularly inspiring, the food is generally consistent and there is enough variety in the menu that everyone in a group will have something they like. This review is overdue - it was actually over a year ago that I ate here - but I remember it quite well. I came with some friends for my birthday, not all 21, so we sat at a table in the general dining area and not the bar. (In general, I prefer to sit in the bar at chain restaurants, because there are no noisy kids and overall a more relaxed feel.) I had not been to an Applebee's before, that I could remember, but this place was centrally located for all my friends, some of whom are picky, so I thought it would be a good option. Well.. it really wasn't. The drink I had was weak and the food was just not good. I had a grilled shrimp entree with veggies and the veggies were completely overcooked, mushy, and pathetic. I couldn't even finish them. The appetizers were good though, so I'm not going to give this place only one star (I reserve those for the truly disgusting places where the food is literally inedible.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=40
Erin B.,"Bellevue, WA",17,23,30,1.0,2/16/2015,"Alright buckle up because I'm about to lay down some hot fire of truth here, and don't take this lightly, we used to come here all the time, but it's been slowly getting worse and worse. The staff is great, but the food is horrendous!! I went there on Valentine's Day, after many bad run ins, (one of which included my 15 year old sister being flirted with by a waiter. But that's for another time!) anyway! The food was awful. We ordered the green been crispers (my favorite thing) we had maybe 6 beans that were actually tasty. The rest were damaged, and just sad. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip, and it was cold. Not even Luke warm. We sent it back, but we were pretty sure they just popped it in the microwave. Everyone's food was mediocre at best, I ordered steak, not grease soup. My steak was covered in this oil/grease and so was the plate. It had a kind of burned taste to it, at first I thought it was a seasoning or something it was fried in but then I realized it wasn't fried... The only thing that was good about my dinner was the mashed potatoes... A hard thing to mess up really. After many attempts at trying to come back here and giving it ""one more chance."" And I got sick after eating here! So if you go here and things are bad, no it isn't just a bad night, it's been bad. It is bad bad bad bad. Wow. Okay, I'm so glad I got that off my chest!

Edith L.,"Forest Hills, NY",84,161,100,3.0,8/20/2015,"Came here late one night for some snacks. Their food was average. 1/2 off happy hour appetizers was a good deal. We had pot stickers, boneless buffalo wings, spinach and artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks. The artichoke dip was too chunky for my liking. The other food was okay but service was slow.

Allie S.,"Bellevue, WA",388,447,36,5.0,12/29/2013,"""Five stars? Really, Applebee's warrants FIVE stars, Allie? What's wrong with you?"" you probably are asking yourself if you're bothering to read this review. There are some caveats. Yes, this is still a chain, yes you'll probably have a similar experience at the Applebee's down the road. This five stars is definitely not on par with some of the fancier restaurants I've bestowed the honor of five-stars upon... But really hear me out: Applebee's is one of the best chains for making crazy requests. I do my best to eat a ketogenic diet so I keep my non-fibrous carbs to a minimum and try to keep my fat content up -- Applebee's is always more than happy to accommodate me and my cray-cray sounding restrictions. Case in point: Tonight the boyfriend and I went and ordered off the 2-for-$20 meal. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and two sirloin steaks. They had no issues with swapping out the tortilla chips that the dip came with raw veggies, swapping out the default mashed potatoes with extra steamed broccoli and didn't judge me when I got my broccoli ""fully loaded,"" with bacon, cheese and sour cream. And this is how they always are -- always willing to go above and beyond to make sure you're getting the meal you want. Applebee's may not be the classiest joint, but for consistency and overall satisfaction, this location is fantastic.  Also, their happy hour is freaking amazing and you don't feel like a terrible person if you trudge in wearing your pajamas... because it's still *Applebee's* -- and sometimes it's just what you need.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=40
Vy M.,"Redmond, WA",198,92,144,3.0,4/23/2016,"Came here for a late night birthday dinner for a coworker. It was also my first time. I've always been skeptical about Applebee's because of some of the negative reviews, but I was excited to try it out for myself. The service towards the end of the night was good but in the beginning, not so much. When our server asked for our drink orders, my coworkers, who were over 21, ordered some margaritas and he asked how many we wanted and I said 4. I don't know if he thought I wanted one as well but when he asked to see our IDs, I was confused about why I needed to show mine since I haven't ordered anything, but I just went ahead and asked if they had Virginia drinks and he said ""how about just a lemonade?"" I thought that was kind of rude but I brushed it off. Next when we got our food, I ordered a steak and shrimp parmesan, steak cooked medium rare but when I got it, my steak was definitely well done. If it was any other time I wouldn't have cared so much, but I just wanted to see how our server would react to me sending back my steak. The way our server handled the situation wasn't as pleasant, but the manager was great. He apologized multiple times and kept checking in. Over all, it wasn't as bad as I thought, but I don't think it would be the first place I'd choose to go to for a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=40
Laura D.,"Kirkland, WA",6,51,14,3.0,12/28/2013,"Honestly I would probably never come back here if it wasn't for the management.  Our waitress was not very good, she forgot my drink on multiple occasions. And when our food came out the bacon in my boyfriends dish was nearly raw. So undercooked it was pink and white! I called her over and told her there was raw bacon in our food and she told me no it was cooked! And proceeded to tell me it was tomatoes and spices in the sauce.  Her manager Scott came over, apologized and replaced our food! When it happened again, he went and checked his kitchen to find sauce that wasn't prepared properly. He removed the charge from our bill and gave us in store credit. He apologized profusely, a very nice young man. If he had not have intervened, we would never be back.

They open the door for you, find you a table really quickly, and if you are a regular they remember what your preferences and are cheerful to converse with. You feel like you are among friends.  The food is average American, but still it is good here. Nothing I haven't had before, but it all tasted great! I like the wings, and friend vegetables.  They also have a lot of screens so you can follow whatever sports event is going on at the time.  But seriously, the service is worth it.

My boyfriend and I like Applebee's because they have decent wings for cheap (Happy hour) and I personally could eat the oriental chicken wrap everyday of my life. The food is solid here, and the staff are overly nice.  I think they are trying to step it up because they have added new menu items. We tried the pretzels with cheese dip- wow, really good and surprisingly fresh, warm pretzels! We also had to order the fried green beans, while they were good they were a little too stringy for fried beans (if you've had these at different places you'll know what I mean). We may order this again, but doubt it. Pretzels, we would totally order again! They have TVs in every corner so my Dad watched the game while I talked his ear off.

Honestly, the food here is just okay. I got the baby back ribs, which were pretty good. BF got the Cajun shrimp and steak, which was okay. We also tried the French onion soup and tomato basil soup, two of our favorite soups, but we weren't wowed by any of it. Dessert, however, was pretty amazing. We ordered the triple chocolate meltdown, which is a fluffy and moist chocolate cake with chocolate drizzled over it. It was very good, and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Kristin C.,"Issaquah, WA",312,689,30,3.0,7/30/2012,"I went into Applebee's expecting it to be the worst thing ever. Honestly. I haven't been to an Applebee's in years. I used to go a lot in college because they had Happy Hour that started at 9, and that's when I got off work across the street. But the food was always so disgusting, I refused to go back.  When Allie S and I decided to get shitfaced on a Saturday night because we were bored, we decided on Applebee's. My plan was to be a complete asshole and get kicked out, but I ended up actually planning on going back.  Sure, the food is still crap, always has been and always will be. I will only order their 1/2 price appetizers during HH, and will never order an entree here. We had some nachos, potato skins, and chicken wings. Most of them were ok, the chicken wings were pretty gross, I ended up just using them as a way to shovel bleu cheese dressing into my mouth. BUT, the food is cheap. It was like $13 total for all that food. Plus, when you're drunk, it doesn't matter as much.  Drinking is the reason to come here, surprisingly, they don't mess up alcohol. I had 3 long island iced teas which are $4 during HH, and for an extra $1 I got top shelf booze and more of it. I also had some sort of huge 32 oz beer which I drank with a straw, gangsta' style(really, white girl college style). They have 2 HH 3-6 and 9-close, everyday.  The real reason to come back though is the service, our server Andrew was fantastic. Nice, great at is job, funny, and cute! He ordered and held more drinks for us before HH ended, he was very friendly and spent a lot of time joking around with us, and even started being inappropriate with us(which had nothing to do with alcohol).  If you have zero expectations coming in here, and just plan on boozing it up, this really isn't *that* horrible of a place. Apparently you can get 30 chicken wings for $11 during HH.... so we plan on having the boys have a chicken wing eating contest, while Allie and I drink a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=40

Taylor M.,"Seattle, WA",0,34,,4.0,5/21/2011,"I have never been a huge fan of Applebee's, but my wife has always likes it; so we go there from time to time.  This was our first time at this Applebee's, and I can say we were both pleasantly surprised.  Doors opened for us, seated within 10 minutes, and our server was at our table in a timely fashion.  We ordered the boneless Buffalo Wings (classic buffalo sauce), Bourbon Street Chicken and shrimp and an order of Three Cheese Chicken Penne for the wife.   The wings were bought out fast, had a good buffalo taste, not too hot but had some kick.  Chicken was moist and all white meat.  The breading was crunchy, but not too thick or over cooked.  We both were surprised at the quality and how well it was cooked.  A Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp was great.  It has Sautéed mushroom and onions over a large piece of chicken breast that was perfectly cooked, with shrimp sprinkled over the dish.  The side was a southwest style baked potato pieces that was fantastic.  Everything was cooked spot on and tasted great.  Applebee's really surprised me with this.  A+ The wife's Three Cheese Chicken Penne was pretty good.  She liked it, but not quite as in love as I was with my dinner.  Penne was cooked just right, chicken was moist had a good seasoning.  The sauce was creamy with the right amount of cheese taste and the side Pico that came with it was matched perfectly.  A We only had two hiccups.  First was that we had to ask for water.  Not a huge deal since we had grabbed drinks from the bar while waiting, but something that was noticed.  Second one was our second round of drinks were a little slow.  Apparently there was some confusion between the bartender and the waiter.  We got our drinks and an apology after a 5 minute wait.  Again, neither are big issues to us, but enough to drop it down to a 4 star rating.   Overall, we really enjoyed it and plan to be regular customers if the food and price continue to be excellent.  The 2 for $20 was an excellent deal and we will try it again on our next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=60

I got some standard small steak with veggies on the side and my friends were on some special diet, so they had some very specific requests for their salads.

The one funny but sad thing is that after my friends told her they were on a special diet and requested very minimal/specific salads, she still offered us brownie bites.

Michael T.,"East Glacier Park, MT",2,14,,1.0,6/1/2010,"Although I'm not a fan of Applebee's generally, I've always had a decent, if overpriced meal.  That is until I had the misfortune to step into the Bel-Red Applebee's.  Three times. The first time, I was alone, late on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant wasn't that busy but clearly they were short on staff, and so I forgave the quite abysmal service. The meal, on the other hand, was unforgivable.  The burger, ordered medium, arrived after 25 minutes.  It had clearly been in the grill for 23 of those minutes.  I've had charred burgers before, but never one that was charred through to the centre.  The bun was completely untoasted, all the better to reveal the stale to the point of mold age.  The fries were your typical fast food frozen fry, and, sadly, the only food worth consuming.  The manager was completely unresponsive to my polite observations when, during checkout, he asked how my meal had been.  Several months later, when hungry and in need of a quick meal out late on a Saturday, and against my better judgment, I again gave this Applebee's another try.  This time, the service was better (actually quite good service, very attentive), and the food hadn't been as thoroughly abused as my first visit, but it still ranked as bad food, carelessly prepared.  Again, the manager (different from my first visit) asked how my meal had been.  I complemented the server before I provided a kind but accurate assessment of the food.  He thanked me for my comments about my waiter as he swiped my card and ignored my comments about the food.  Please don't blame me for giving this Applebee's the third try:  I had carpooled with friends to a play, and they wanted to have a post-performance meal here.  I attempted to dine defensively (soup and salad) but once again, I fell victim to what has to be one of the most incompetent kitchens (or perhaps I should say uncaring managements) in all of Washington.

Ian L.,"Renton, WA",6,14,1,5.0,7/4/2007,"My name is Ian L., and I am addicted to Applebee's Happy Hour wings.  I'll admit it, sometimes I go two, three times a week on a carnivorous rampage, leaving nothing but a 5"" tall lincoln-log cabin of discarded bone and gristle in my wake. Not even the celery survives.  The people I work with: also addicts. A week without wings, we show signs of withdrawal. Now we can't even order wings anywhere else without a feeling of infidelity gripping our hearts. And at like $10 for 30 wings? Delicious, tangy-hot classic-sauce drenched wings? Or perhaps the salivation-inducing honey barbecue, with the power to negate otherwise fiery aftermath, even at a 2-to-1 ratio? The value is as inescapable as the flavor.  I got hooked with Wing Dome... that's where I got my first fix. And Wingdome IS excellent, arguably the best, especially with the variety of flavors. But when you've got this hunger for like, 15-45 wings a week, at a dollar a wing you're practically on the crack-smoker's road to poverty. And really, nobody should be giving blow-jobs for wings. Cut that down to about $0.33/ wing, and you've got a habit you can live with. I don't come to Applebee's for burgers, or kid food, or drinks, or Mexican. I come for the super-cheap, delicious wings, and at this point, it's hardly a choice.

We were seated within 10 minutes.  2)Ordering  After we were seated the server (her name starts with A) was right away there and started offering the specials etc. We told her we will try 2 for $20, she said sure are you ready to order then? we said sure and ordered right away.  3) Food Arrival  Food arrived in an acceptable time and appetizers and entrees had almost exact time gap in between,  4) Food quality,quantity and test  Food seemed fresh and was served hot. I was so full with the appetizer itself that when the entree came we told our server ""A"" to pack mine fro to-go and she readily did that with a smile. we shared the other entree. The entree and appetizer were real dinner size and not as we thought previously that will be smallas we ordered a special 2 for $20. 5) Billing  Billing was on time and there was a special hand written thanks from the server. Our bill with dessert came around $30 including tip which is reasonable. 6)Departure  Last but no least every staff we met on our way out thanked us.  I gave 4 start and not 5 just because the server never asked for dessert we have to order ti on our own, the reason could be she was thinking that we were already stuffed;) as we took a whole entree to go.  Overall a great dine-out experience , much better than what you expect from traditional chain diners.  Thanks for reading , hope your experience is as great as ours. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=80
Chris D.,"Tacoma, WA",8,19,,1.0,1/1/2010,"I didn't have very high expectations for Applebee's from the start.  I realize that it's a chain restaurant that specializes in comfort food, and it may be good when viewed from that perspective but my review is based on their lower calorie menu options. I prefer to eat pretty healthy and it's hard to find good places to go out to eat that have healthy choices, but I thought it would be worth giving Applebee's a shot after hearing that they have some lower calorie choices and weight watchers points shown for some menu items.  I ended up choosing one of the dishes with the weight watchers points shown called Garlic Herb Chicken.  It was horrible.  The chicken was totally drenched in sauce that was way too strong and incredibly salty. The potatoes and veggies that came with it also appeared to be drenched in oil or butter so I was kind of doubting that the meal was really as low in fat and calories as shown on the menu.  I couldn't even finish it, it was just too gross. If this meal was representative of the healthy choices they offer, Applebee's should forget it and stick to the usual comfort food that they probably do a lot better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=80
Miranda L.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",3,97,1,2.0,12/22/2008,"I had to knock a star after trying out the breakfast this past Sunday. Not that it was the worst experience ever, but it just wasn't that good. We saw the advertising card during happy hour one day and decided to give it a try. First off, the place was completely empty. There were maybe two or three parties spread out through the restaurant. We thought we had really scored as the lady sat us. There was some rather obnoxious kid that belonged to a waitress that would randomly shout out things toward the kitchen whenever he got bored. I understand because of the weather, mom probably didn't have a choice but to bring him to work, but it was still mildly irritating. So we could deal with that, no problem. Then about five minutes into the thing, these old people come walking up, apparently the regulars in the booth RIGHT NEXT TO US. I don't mind having to sit right next to people when a restaurant is full and there is a lot of noise, but once again, there were maybe 3 parties in the entire place. If they have regulars and an empty restaurant, then why did we have to sit right next to the stupid regulars booth? They were loud because they were four old people, and we all know they have to speak loudly about annoying old people gossip, practically shouting to hear each other talk about boring old people gossip. Yuck. So we were instantly annoyed. Not a problem if the place had been busy, but it was empty. So we moved ourselves a couple of tables away. I think the staff was annoyed that we moved, but we didn't care. They didn't say anything, but you can see their customer service veneer fade slightly, and the lady hardly checked on us, even though we were only two tables away now instead of one from her regulars, and she was checking up on them about twice as much. Okay, the other thing that really irritated us... the mimosas took FOREVER to get to us. We could even see the guy making them after about five minutes of standing around. Then after he made them, it took him a while to even start meandering over to us. Tasty, though, I have to admit. The food was meh... okay... I don't recommend getting anything with too much egg to it. I felt the eggs were kind of gross, and the hashbrowns had the taste of being cooked with bad oil or on a dirty grill or something. It appears that they put the rookie staff on during Sundays, because there were people constantly being trained, or people that seemed like they didn't quite know what they were supposed to be doing. Basically, Applebee's should just stick with the Happy Hour and mediocre dinner thing. The boy might want to go back for breakfast, but I would rather run through the drive-thru and make my own mimosas next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=80
Brittany F.,"Kirkland, WA",1,7,,3.0,1/31/2012,"Cheap, friendly and fast at lunch.  Average prices for dinner.  Very comparable for the area.  The food is just what you would expect.  Some of it tastes fresh out of the bag it came from but sometimes something is surprisingly good.  I will go here when I am going out to eat with a lot of people or people with kids.  Lots of selection, something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7?start=80

I come to this location very often because of the staff there. Shout out to Erving for being a great waiter and giving good service!  I really enjoy coming here for the appetizers for happy hour. You can really just order bunch of appetizers to share with friends for a good price. Very chill place to come hang out and chill with your friends.

Jimmy B.,"Bellevue, WA",19,312,125,4.0,4/11/2017,"Stopped in for a quick lunch between accounts.  What started off not so good, turned out pleasant.  Sat down at the bar, perused the menu looking for something that's not too filling but will satisfy my hunger, and settled in on the build your own app.    After waiting about 8 minutes, I was finally greeted by the bartender, and even before I could say hello, was interrupted by another employee asking the bartender a question.   Not impressed by the lack of manners.  Unbeknownst to me, where I sat at the bar, is also used for staging ""to go"" orders and stacking dishes headed to the back room, not a pleasant seat.   Now for the main topic....the food.  My order came out fairly quickly, hot, and was VERY tasty.   For a large chain operation, Applebees is usually very consistent at reasonable prices.     Everyone at the bar but me was greeted by the their first name, so obviously there's a ton of repeat business from locals.  That in itself is a great compliment to the staff (not the guy who interrupted me), the management, and the quality of good, especially when you have so many other options near by.   I'll definitely be back when I'm around this part of town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7

Maybe that's just me. Anyway, my wife and I had the two for twenty five selection. Starting with the wonderful salad, when Oscar brought it out I turned him away saying we didn't order a salad entree. It turns out that this huge beautiful thing was the salad appetizer. It was beautifully put together with all kinds of greens not just iceberg and bits of tomato, cucumber, bacon and some other stuff. Our entree selection, 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs with fries and garlic green beans, was wonderfully messy and delicious. Oscar our waiter was courteous and attentive with handi wipes, napkins,drink refills and everything else one would want in a professional wait staff.

As far as this location goes, it's very convenient for lunch, meetings, or happy hour at the end of a tough work day. They are also very understandable with your health choices so substituting something is no problem.   Best healthy choice - Savory Cedar Salmon with roasted veggies but substitute potatoes for more veggies.

We were seated quickly, our server was really nice and checked in on us an ample amount of times... But I just wasn't wowed with my food. I got the nacho appetizer and it's probably the most ""eh"" nacho appetizer around. It supposedly comes with white queso, but I didn't taste or see it, and there was a wimpy amount of cheddar. I asked if they had guac, unfortunately they don't, but the server said he could get me a side of avocado... Turns out they ran out. The pulled brisket was the best part of that dish.

Michelle L.,"Bellevue, WA",126,173,10,3.0,8/20/2015,"I have been told that I am a ""grandma"" for going to Applebee's for drinks. About 85% of the customers are senior citizens, ingredients are probably never fresh but always frozen, and the ambience is a bit tacky with all of the decorations on the walls.  But here's how I see it. Happy hour is consistent and you can count on it having your standard ""bar"" food. you've got your chicken wings, your spinach and artichoke dip, sliders, etc. etc. Drinks are to the point and simple. They do their job! If I want a vodka soda with extra lime then I will get exactly that, and I don't have to worry about seeing a ridiculous price for it on my bill. Lastly, I can be totally relaxed in this place. I don't gotta worry about acting all fancy schmancy!  So, if the boyfriend and I are just looking to have a chill but fun time? We go to Applebee's! I mean, why not? We hang out in the bar and have our drinks, have some food, and walk out with numb faces. it's allllll good.

Pawares P.,"Bellevue, WA",172,85,151,4.0,12/10/2015,"This review is for my last 2 visits at Applebee's at this location (1st was about 1 month ago at 11 pm, 2nd one was around 10 pm on 12/9/15) Due to my weird working schedule, I usually get off work late 4-6 days a week.  So, I have limited choices of restaurants where I can sit to eat, drink beer and chill after a long day of work.  This Applebee's right here happens to locate close to my house (about 10 blocks away), so whenever I want to have dine-in late night steak with reasonable price, I would come here.  For the last 2 times, I got the same thing.  It was the Bourbon Street Steak (I think the price was 16 dollars?).  The reason I got it again?  Because it satisfied me!  I know the quality of the steak wasn't as amazing as real steak house.  But I'm talking about 10-11 pm Dine-in restaurant... Who else does that you know??  So, I have been happy about this Bourbon Steak I got, which came with grilled mushrooms and onions, and I asked for side of mashed potato instead of baked potatoes. Although I went there late, the service there usually was great... not amazing though.  There were a few times where I had to wait too long for my drink or for someone to walk by, but whatever, it was late so the staffs were shorter than day time.  The server always checked if my steak was cooked right by letting me cut it opened in the middle right after he served me.  He also asked me if I wanted extra steak sauces, which I always got A1 and Ketchup to eat with my steak at Applebee's.   You can tell that I was happy with my meal because I ate everything on my sizzling plate... or maybe I was just hungry?? who knows haha.  All I know is I got full, a bit buzzed and felt relaxing meanwhile watching Sports Center on one of their 4-5 tvs...  The bill came out to be 22 dollars for a steak and beer, reasonable price.   Overall, I have been happy with my experience here.  I'm glad I live close by to it, and I'm sure I will keep going back once or twice a month for late-night steak and beer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7

Good that is till i got home and became so sick i had to throw up what i just ate and had stomach pains till the next day.

I don't know but once a place gives me under cooked food or food that is not acceptable to serve and it gets me so sick to where i waste that $ i just spend on the food to just throw it up, i won't ever be giving them a second chance and i won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellevue-7
