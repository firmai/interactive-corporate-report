With plenty of tables available we had to wait 20 min to be seated. The waitress was very nice but the food was tasteless and undercooked. My steak was so undercooked blood pooled on my plate.

I won't even try to list all the issues, only to say unless you want your stomach pumped I would not even drive by that place.  We now know why there were only 6 cars in the parking lot on a Friday night.   I asked for the manager, showed him the report on the NC site, he hung his head in disbelief, asked if we wanted to eat at the other location, even called ahead so that we would not have to wait.  So we drove down the road about 7 miles to the location on Raeford Road at Harris Teeter.  They had a high B score, we got our food in 20 minutes, even though they were packed.    I've walked in this location 3 times since then, low scores each time.  Surprised the company hasn't overhauled this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fayetteville-13?start=20,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001

Quick with refills, order was correct, cleared dirty plates quickly (a pet peeve of mine is sitting at a table full of dirty dishes and empty glasses). The food was typical Applebee's fare, but the 2 for $20 is a great deal. Had chips and queso, fiesta lime chicken (too much cheese on it) and the sirloin with fries (instead of the garlic potatoes and broccoli that normally comes with it). Had two beers from the bar and didn't have to wait long for those either. All in all, it was a good trip to Applebee's and review worthy since Laura did a great job.

22,Willie J.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,3,1.0,1.0,2015-03-01,This by far is the worst Applebee's I've ever been to. They made people wait 15-30 minutes to be seated when the place was less than half full. The hostess said it was because the cooks needed time to catch up. When I complained to the manager she said it's because the tables weren't clean. Looked clean to me so basically it was all BS!

We had three small kids with us walked in the hostess told us they had a 10 minute wait. No problem. 30 minutes later she sat a party of five and a party of eight that came in after us before us. We had two adults, one child, and two high chairs. The restaurant was half full. The hostess blew us off and said the party of eight called in which the server later told us they can't make reservations so it was an excuse. Ten minutes later the manager said they were trying to figure out a table I said pick one put two high chairs at it. I was going to leave at that point but my three children were hungry and would've had a melt down. We finally are seated service is slow not due to the server he was doing his best. We finally get our food 40 minutes later and my food was full of raw onions I couldn't even eat it. I asked the server did it say in the description there would be raw onions he didn't know and came back and said they were supposed to be cooked but it wasnt in the description so the manager comped our bill right dollars. At this point my kids were beyond done, I didn't even get to eat, and two hours later we finally left with only my food comped. I have never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. Management is horrible, the assistant manager did a better job. He did not even bother to come and speak to us, apologize, or anything. The server, Shane was very nice and doing the best he could in the terrible circumstances. How are you not staffed on a Saturday night?
