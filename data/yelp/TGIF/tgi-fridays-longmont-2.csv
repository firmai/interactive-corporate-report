Allen S.,"Boulder, CO",16,147,141,4.0,10/17/2017,"This is a ""middle of the road"" restaurant that is competent but (for the most part) nothing special. My wife and I eat here every couple of weeks. Their standout dishes are the tomato basil soup, that is very rich and creamy with a strong sharp tomato flavor (be sure to order the breadsticks too), and the Really Good Cheeseburger, that lives up to its name: reasonably sized and good seasonings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2
A S.,"Longmont, CO",0,7,,5.0,1/5/2018,Have gone several times to enjoy their ribs special.  Each time the food was very good but the staff is incredible.  The servers understand service and how to connect with customers.  Each of the servers demonstrated the same great attitude and service.  Made it feel like home and much more enjoyable.  Very different than other chain restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2
Skip V.,"Frederick, CO",5,8,,1.0,4/26/2017,"A great night out with the family was ruined by an ""amateur"" bar manager (who calls herself ""Boo"") that made sure she followed corporate guidelines to have underage kids out of the bar by 9pm. She kicked us out!  As a former TGIF waiter I took great pride in treating people with respect and earning the right to be a ""call"" waiter who in-turn showed their appreciation with their tips. That experience helped me launch a great career in sales and I've always appreciated TGI Friday's until now, we will never place foot in this TGIF restaurant again!  A night of endless appetizers with the family (which includes three teenagers) at Friday's in Longmont, CO sounded like a great idea when suggested by my oldest. We plowed through our fair share of food, watched our favorite sports teams playing on the screens, had a check totaling more than $100. and were satisfied with the great service by our ""dub/dub"" Jamie, who was awesome. This was immediately ruined by a chunky little bar manager who calls herself ""Boo""! Without any preliminary warning she walks up to our table and demands that we must leave the bar right now! Lacking any social grace this woman displayed a rudeness and attitude that disrespected both the TGI Friday's brand and corporate parent Sentinel Capital Partners. We weren't allowed to wear our red & white striped shirts when we drove to work back when I used to wait tables for TGIF, the fact that they would allow such an inept troll to manage a restaurant and treat employees like a prison labor camp (they are all afraid of her) lets me know that it's not the same restaurant brand it used to be and I can have a great time with my family elsewhere!  I've been treated better by a McDonald's manager in a nearby Wal-Mart for buying less than $30. worth of greasy food than what my family received at the Longmont TGI Friday's! Advice to the Sentinel Capital Partners: You need to get rid of the lousy management you have there or risk closing your doors. You lost my family forever as a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2

Christine G.,"Greeley, CO",37,19,6,2.0,7/30/2017,"Decided to give this place a try. Was less than impressed. Arrived on Sunday afternoon, about 2 in the afternoon. There were about 8 to 10 tables with guest seated. One waiter, and a hostess for the whole restaurant. My husband and I decided to give their endless apps a try. For not being that busy, it took 35 minutes from time of placing our order for our first round to be served. Frozen food, that has been heated. I got the ""New"" chicken casadillia.  It was mushy, and luke warm, although, my husband's was served hot, and fresh looking. Mine appeared like it hed been under a heat lamp for quite some time. Over the course of an hour we tried several different appetizers. Potatoe skins were hot but you can tell they were previously frozen. We have had much better. The only one worth ordering more than once was their pot stickers. They were good. Loaded bacon nachos were VERY salty, weird queso cheese, tasted off, and processed bacon bits...the waiter was friendly, but seemed over worked. Forgot that he was going to bring me ice for my warm iced tea and kept mixing up our app recorders. Overall, I would choose someplace else before returning to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2
William H.,"Longmont, CO",0,16,,1.0,2/19/2017,"We were a group of 12, so I understand that causes certain complications, but we did make our reservation 2 days in advance so they knew we were coming.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 6pm reservation and happily waited for our table.  We got our food at 7:10 and it came out meal by meal, which is somewhat understandable for a group our size.  They were out of about 1/3 of the stuff we asked for between smoothies and other menu items.  I didn't find out they were out of my food (Ghost Pepper Wings) until they arrived (with Classic Buffalo instead).  The hamburgers were unlabeled, so they had to try to guess which burger was which by what was on it, leading to at least one burger being partially eaten before they took it back, switched it out for the right one and having to re-make one burger.  We had a number of items (especially stuff after the original ordering) that we had to remind our server about.I finally signed my check and left at 7:50, two hours after we arrived. The server was earnest and seemed to be doing the best she could, but I don't know where the organization broke down.  I would not expect to go back if I can avoid it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2
Katherine N.,"Erie, CO",26,42,12,4.0,8/24/2016,"We love TGIFridays. This particular location is great because you rarely have to wait on a seat and when you do, the time frame they give you is always accurate. Food is always tasty and cooked well. Service has always been good, only once did we have iffy service but they were full of big parties & understaffed that day but even I have to give them credit for keeping Up as well as they did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2
Addison J.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,5.0,8/13/2016,"This is the best TGI Fridays I have been too, and that is not exaggeration. From the moment we walked in the host was on fire! This guy was friendly, focused, and upbeat - great host traits, and saw too it that we had a plethora of tables clean and able to be served. We opted for the bar, but not after the host with the most had made a table up - fantastic work ethic. The server we had was the most cheerful Fridays server I have ever witnessed. This dude was able to make an art out of serving up chain restaurant food - great job. The food was cooked well and not dry or sloppy. Brownie Obsession is the greatest kept dessert secret, it blows any desert out of the water any time any place.

Anna K.,"Waterloo, IN",5,25,14,3.0,4/14/2015,"We were a table of 4. Two people ordered salad. The salad was fine. Not spectacular. The french fries were luke warm and overly seasoned. The broccoli had long stems. The baked mac n cheese was really yummy, as was the makes potatoes, steamed spinach, steak and ""lobster & salmon in cajun alfredo sauce"". The coffee was too bitter,  the whisky cake with vanilla ice cream was ok. They didn't eat it all between 3 people so... Lastly, they seemed short staffed. Our waitress didn't come to our table often enough and the coffee and water were not replenished quick enough. The greeter dude with dreads and a beard was wonderful, but for the price, the food and service at the table should have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2

Nicole M.,"Appleton, WI",68,77,3,2.0,3/19/2013,"Trivia on Tuesday nights is great.  We love the DJ and the entertainment.  However, the waitstaff in the bar area is consistently lacking.  They take too long to get to our table, disappear to who knows where, and seem completely annoyed when others arrive even though we gave them a heads up.  They have delivered food without silverware, forgot drink orders and failed to grab any empty glasses or plates.  The girls act like we give bad tips or something, even though every week we tip more than our fair share.  It just... boggles our minds. Besides the staff, the food is always good.  Never bad, or fantastic, but consistently good.  So that's something at least. If you come here, sit in the restaurant section if you want better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2
Andrew S.,"Longmont, CO",21,58,49,1.0,8/13/2014,"When we walked in, there were about 10-15 open tables in the dining room.  The host came up and asked how many (host was a thin young guy with flat blond hair).  I said 2.  He said it would be about 10 minute wait.  What!?!?  I asked if we could just sit at any of the open tables, and he said no.  I asked why as that didn't make any sense.  He said they didn't have enough waiters.  This was 6:30pm on a weekday.  Less than 1/2 the dining room was full.  Still didn't make sense to me.  We stood in the entryway for 5 min and one of the waiters walked up and asked if we needed help.  I said we needed a table, and he said he could take us in his section no problem.  Guess the waiters who work on tips care more about serving customers than the management. Either the management didn't hire enough waiters (poor management) or this was intentional to make the restaurant seem busy (I would also call this poor management....making people wait around for no reason). I wanted to leave, but my wife insisted we stay. Later in the evening, there weren't any additional waiters, but they filled up all of the dining room, and no one complained about slow service or anything.  I think making us wait was an intentional attempt to make the restaurant seem popular. Once we had a table, service was good, and food was acceptable (not good). I wouldn't come back just because I don't like standing around for 10min while there are open tables and the waiters don't have a problem serving us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2

The ahi tuna crisp with guacamole appetizer was amazing!  I never in a million years would have expected such quality from a chain?  We also had the warm pretzel/cheese appetizer on the waiter's recommendation.  YUM - I could eat those all day long!

They were all delicious and I love that you can sample whichever one you want now. However the service was not the greatest, the waitress Amanda lacked to refill our drinks several times to wheer we had to stand up and get her attention because she was just talking at the server station, which is a pet peeve for me since I know she was not busy.

We just came in for drinks, no food. We asked the waiter (a bald guy with a beard) the happy hour specials. He told us that ALL draft beers are 2.50 during happy hour. cool right, so we all got a pumpkick (new belgium beer). keep in mind there were 4 of us at 2.50 cents...that would be around 10.00 total. well, when our bill came, somehow our total jumped to 17.00. We alerted our waiter and said he mis charged us. He then went on to tell us that only bud light and coors light were the 2.50 draft beers.

Jonathan W.,"Frederick, CO",11,35,3,3.0,12/8/2010,"We were invited out to TGIFriday's to taste some of their new menu items. Six locations in Colorado are trying out these new dishes and with what we got to taste, I would say they are going to do very well.  We tried three of the new appetizers: Heavenly Hummus, Ahi Tuna with Avocado Crisps and Warm Pretzels with Colorado Native Beer Cheese Dipping Sauce. We started with the Pretzels. Here's how it reads on the menu: Dunk these thick oven warmed pretzels in our creamy cheese sauce with Colorado Native beer.  Fresh pretzels, beer cheese. Do I really need to say more? It was GOOOD so good you wanted to lick the sauce out of the bottom of the bowl once the pretzels were gone. If you go for nothing else stop by for a order of these! Next, we tried the Ahi Tuna. Here's the description: Blackened Ahi tuna slices on warm tortilla chips, with chunky guacamole, jalapenos, and cool veggie slivers, splashed with Lemon Basil Vinaigrette and Wasabi Ranch dressing.  I haven't tried avocado much and didn't really think I liked it, but I liked it in this concoction. The flavors blended beautifully. The one thing I would suggest to those who try this, is make sure you don't forget there's a jalapeno on this dish. I got that as my last bite and it was a little kick that I wasn't expecting. Next up was the Heavenly Hummus. The menu says: A blend of garbanzo beans and sesame tahini, garnished with classic Mediterranean goodies and served with pita bread pieces. He says: Hmmpf Hummus! That was my original thought along with ewwww, gross, and please noooooo, but decided to be a good sport and give it a try even though I knew from previous experience I would not like it. Well, I was wrong. When you got a bit of everything on that pita it was just darn yummy. I would actually order this on my own and that is saying something indeed. So, I say TRY this even you hummus haters out there (like me) you will be surprised. Out of the appetizers, I would pick the pretzels and the Ahi Tuna again. On to the main dishes! We tried four different dishes: Victory Garden Pasta, Sizzling Chimmichuri Steak and Fries, Grilled Vegetable Dagwood and the Turkey Cranberry Reuben. The Victory Garden Pasta: Spaghetti tossed with sauteed fresh broccoli, cherry tomatoes, radicchio, spinach and sugar snap peas in a lemon vegetable sauce with basil butter and parmasean. .  This was my least favorite of the dishes we tried. That's not to say that it was bad, it just wasn't up to par with the other dishes.  Sizzling Chimmichuri Steak and Fries: Tender grilled flat iron steak, with peppers and onions, grape tomatoes and a spicy Chimmichui sauce for authentic flavor served with crispy fries.  This came out sizzling and smelled delicious. The meat was tender and tasty, and mixed with the peppers and onions made it a great combo.  Grilled Vegetable Dagwood: Crisp toasted pita piled high with spinach, broccoli slaw with mango chutney mayo, cucumber and tomato slices, and grilled tandoori-marinated veggies, garnished with goat cheese crumbles.  Vegatarian again, another hmmpf for me (are you getting I like meat), but you know it was good, really good. I wont go so far as to say I would order it on my own, but if someone at the table did I would want a nibble. For a veggie sandwich it's hard to beat. Turkey Cranberry Reuben: Rye bread with Cranberry jalapeno thousand island dressing and a generous layer of whole berry cranberry sauce to cushion smoked roast turkey, bubbly melted swiss cheese and a layer of crunch cranberry coleslaw.  He says:MMMMMMM YUMMMMMM  NUM NUM NUM!!   Step away from my reuben, violaters risk being bitten.  Think my point may have gotten across. I REALLLLLLY liked this.  .  We tried one new dessert and one current dessert.  Berry Shortcake Sliders: Warm flaky almond biscuits topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries glazed in a light strawberry syrup, with whipped cream and a dusting of powered sugar.  .  This was ok. Not great, and not bad - just ok. The talk about the table was that this would be a great brunch dessert and I think that's a good idea.  Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie: Chocolate ganache layered with peanut butter mousse in a peanut butter graham cracker crust. Topped with whipped cream and a peanut butter cup.  He says: Yumm! I love peanut butter and chocolate any way so no way this could go wrong. It is however very rich and probably best shared. If you haven't been to TGIFriday's for a while, we would recommend you get there and try some of these new dishes for yourself. It's a fun night out with friends and ordering a few things and sharing them, by doing so you can try more of the new stuff or share some of your old favorites with friends if you like feel free to visit our blog for pictures and more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2?start=20
Carl S.,"Longmont, CO",8,60,,3.0,11/22/2009,"The easiest way to describe this place is if you've seen Office Space. I kept looking for flares on our waiter :D  We stopped by for lunch and were greeted at the front door. She led us to our table and told us our waiter's name is Johnny. The place wasn't too busy for a Saturday lunch crowd however the Chick-Fil-A's grand opening was going on across the parking lot which was probably drawing folks away. Johnny came by a minute later to take our drink order. Tall slender guy with an oversized knit hat. Very friendly. I ordered the BBQ chicken wrap. It did take several minutes to arrive, apparently due to fries not being ready. It was pretty good, a little spicy. The fries were a little sparse though. Afterwards I ordered the brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Man that was sweet. I did finish it but I wasn't hungry for dinner until 7pm.

Benjamin F.,"Longmont, CO",0,17,,2.0,3/31/2012,"TGI Friday's changed their menu nationwide in 2010, and since then it's not worth going. Most of the best menu items have disappeared entirely. The ""grown up mac and cheese"" was particularly good nice (and a healthier preparation too), but it's long gone from the options. The fries are now shoestring style, making them less suitable for dipping, and inevitably making your hands greasier (use of a fork is now impractical). The fried green beans are still there, and are still delicious, but TGI Friday's has a line of frozen snacks you can buy at the grocery store, and those green beans are just as good as what's in the restaurant (and for a lot less money). Last time I was here the only item I even considered was the burger, and there are better places to get burgers in Longmont. Pumphouse Brewery on Main Street downtown is an excellent alternative. Before 2010 this was a great casual family restaurant. With the new menu, it's a little too specialized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2?start=20

Amanda H.,"Erie, CO",3,7,,1.0,4/17/2011,"I've never really been super impressed with TGI Friday's, but the last time I went to this restaurant was the one in Longmont. We had a truly awful experience for lunch. The restaurant was absolutely freezing to the point where everyone in my group ate with their coats on. When we relayed our complaint to the staff, we were told that there was nothing they could do about turning up the heat, even though literally every patron was dining with their coats on. The food was lackluster at best, save for the cheese devilled eggs, which were actually quite delicious. My mom ordered breakfast nachos and when the food came out, they brought out an order of their normal nachos. I was finished with my meal before her correct meal was brought out. In the mean time, our party ate the nachos that were originally brought out because the server didn't take them away and also because they would've just been thrown away. At the end of the meal, the server actually asked us if we wanted to pay for both orders of nachos. I felt that was entirely inappropriate and extremely poor taste, as well as just terrible customer service. I will definitely not be returning to this restaurant and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-longmont-2?start=20
