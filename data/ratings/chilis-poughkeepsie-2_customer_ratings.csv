17,Carlos G.,"Tarrytown, NY",45,57,408.0,4.0,2012-04-01,Very good service. Manager named Carol was very gregarious. Best of all the chain restaurants in my opinion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
20,J N.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,38,65.0,4.0,2013-06-13,"I always enjoy the food here, and the drinks are awesome too. Out of the dozens of times I've been there, I only had a bad waitress one time & that was today. I will overlook her short comings because I know most of the other staff members are very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2?start=20,,,,,
19,Kapri C.,"Millwood, NY",2,3,,5.0,2013-10-14,Went around 3pm and had the lunch special with a friend. The portions are great for the price. I love the strawberry lemonade. Chili's is my go to for lunch/dinner. Staff was very friendly as well. I will definitely be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
21,Patricia C.,"Port Washington, NY",1,29,,4.0,2014-01-25,"We went to this Chili's with family for a quick meal.  There were 7 of us. We ordered 3 of the Two for $20 meals.  Each comes with one appetizer and two full meals from a list on the menu.  The waiter was good to tell us that some other meals could be counted for this 2for20 - he failed to tell us that there was a small up charge - but that was no big deal.  The up charge ended up being $2, just would have liked to know before we had to question the bill that was confusing.   The food was very tasty, and fresh.  The chips and guacamole was very good and the flatbread also was good.  All the appetizers were completely finished.  We  had chicken and steak meals and all tasted very good. We would order again.  The only small thing was my Mom asked if the Pico was spicy and was told not at all.  The waiter was a bit off on that and it did have a bit of a kick but to be expected.  Thankfully it was easy to just push off the chicken and not eat, Mom was happy. I would recommend this Chili's if you are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2?start=20,,,,,
14,Jared T.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",69,101,14.0,5.0,2015-06-27,"Chili's is excellent. Clean place and the food is killer. One of my preferred places to go for food, hands down. Staff here are very quick and the bill is very affordable. Burgers here are also very good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
15,Lisa M.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",4,45,,1.0,2015-10-10,"We were there for lunch yesterday and had a truly bad experience.  When we arrived, the restaurant was 3/4 empty.  We waited to be seated.  Our waitress took our order right away.  It seemed great.  We waited 20 minutes for our appetizers (and the manager brought those out).  The nachos were kind of burned and cold and the Texas Cheese Fries were cold and soggy.  It took an additional 30 minutes to get our meals.  I got the pick 2 or 3.  I had the chicken enchilada and the beef enchilada.  The chicken was dry and the little bit of sauce on top had soaked into the tortilla and it was cold.  The beef in the other enchilada was burned to a crisp (no exaggerating).  It was blackened ground beef.  It was cold.  The Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich was passable.  Through this all, we saw our waitress 2x.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
11,Margeaux H.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",3,5,,1.0,2016-06-04,"Had the absolute worst experience here last night. Took us 50 minutes to get our entrees after being seated. Went to the host to request that the manager come over, and the manager never came. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
7,Dave P.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",17,63,18.0,1.0,2016-07-10,"I was here three months ago and thought that Chili's was getting back to its original greatness.  I convinced my wife to give it a second chance.  It was a huge mistake.  I ordered the hamburger with the grass fed beef.  I asked for it to be medium rare.  The waitress said it comes in pink or non pink.  I ordered pink.  It came out brown and the fries were cold. I asked them to remake it.  Fifteen minutes later it came out the same way with cold fries. By now we are too hungry to send it except for the fries. The waitress explained that it is really hard to make the grass fed beef medium. I explained that it is 4 minutes on each side.  She said the manager would come out and talk to us. He walked by twice but never stopped.   Now my wife is in ""I told you so mode"" and I am eating  crow. When we explained to the manager he hands the impression that he was used to being complained to.  I guess three months ago was an anomaly.  Avoid this Chilis",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
16,Mellanie P.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",170,9,,1.0,2016-07-17,"I used to love this restaurant. Every time I go it's a new bad experience these days. Service was eh, but completely understandable because it was busy. I ordered the rare 6oz sirloin steak salad. First problem, it was literally an uncut piece of steak with a side of mixed greens with cheese one it. And cooked tomatoes that were cold and super soggy. So I asked for more mixed greens so I could attempt to make a salad. Server was helpful. I cut into my steak so I can put it on the greens and it's very well done. I ordered rare. I made a joke to the server and said I wanted it to moo at me, she laughed and apologized and went to get a new steak. The manager comes out, serves me the steak, says is this better, dude the steak was about to hop of my plate. Like it was raw, cold, blue and looked disgusting. Spiteful people eh? So I took it home, and seared it more, what a shitty cut of meat. I ate half of it and ran to the bathroom puking. Very very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
9,Bonnie G.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,13,5.0,2.0,2016-08-07,I had dinner here last night. The service was very good the food was very good as well. The only reason I am giving it only two stars is because is was filthy. The rest rooms were disgusting. They looked like they haven't been cleaned in a very long time.  The floors were extremely dirty as well.  The bar was equally as dirty.  If the kitchen bears any resemblance to the rest of the place I would be afraid to look. Because if the  filth I will not be returning. Sad to say.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
13,Michele B.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",0,10,,1.0,2016-08-12,Takes too long for lunch.  A simple lunch combo and glass of water shouldn't take over an hour especially when the restaurant isn't packed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
12,Susan G.,"Fishkill, NY",0,3,,2.0,2016-09-05,food was mediocre at best. Waited over 30 minutes for order to come out. Waited another 10 minutes for butter and honey mustard after order was served. Will be my last time there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
8,Eugene G.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",79,1,,1.0,2016-11-29,Absolutely horrible service. Walked in at 1:15pm on 11/29 a rainy Tuesday. We stood at the entrance 5 minutes before being instructed to sit and another 5 for drinks. Ricky was the bartender who seated us and clearly running around solo. It seemed it was him and 1 other waitress working the entire store. We walked out after being there 20 minutes in total. Horrible service. Horrible attention to customers. Please clean your menus they stick together.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
6,Rob R.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,62,72.0,4.0,2017-01-22,On the whole not bad for chain food.  The quesadillas where as good as many that I have had at authentic Mexican restaurants the staff filled our drinks quickly overall a good experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
10,Steve G.,"Red Hook, NY",0,11,1.0,1.0,2017-02-06,Was very disappointed with. Queso loaded wings.  Very little Queso.   Very dry yuck....had really good ones in Albany wolf road  Resturant  these sucked.. Long Island ice teas. Really good...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
5,Enxhi D.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",2,58,31.0,4.0,2017-02-11,"I've been here a few times, the last time was a few weeks ago for a dinner date. The service has always been great, and the food was actually pretty nice especially for a chain. They have nice drink deals too, last time we ordered 2 beers for the price of 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
2,William G.,"San Diego, CA",50,89,79.0,1.0,2017-07-26,"Well where do I start.... We came as a group of four, 3 of the 4 of us ordered the 2 for 1 drink special and I had a Long Island. Drinks weren't bad, no complaints there. We then went on to order. I got the chicken and waffles meal. The waffles were really sweet and so was the sauce and chicken. But besides the food, let's get to the part that gave them one star. As we were eating I started to notice little baby ants crawling all over the window ledge we were sitting under and on the table. My lady quickly jumped out the booth only to see that they were on the bench and a few were crawling on her leg. She even found a few in her bag later that night. At this point we are totally grossed out. The manager comes over and offers to give us the drinks for free. We are like whatever at this point. The check comes back and the drinks were discounted but still on there. We didn't want to make a scene so we just paid and left. In my opinion that whole meal should have been free. I literally paid to be grossed out and have ants crawl my lady and in our food. That night everybody had the creepy crawler feeling like the ants were still crawling on us when we got back to the house. I'm totally done with Chilis and I'm mad because out of Applebees, Friday's and Chilis, chilis was my favorite. Smh.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
4,Maryann P.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",26,2,,5.0,2017-10-14,"Our favorite! Everything we have ordered has been delicious. at this location! We had one bad experience with one sever a couple of years ago but that has changed. Over the past year or more we have had nothing but good things to say. We have eaten many different things and all have been cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. Steaks, burgers, chicken dishes and ribs as well as the appetizers all good. I highly recommend Chili's  Poughkeepsie. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,

1,Dave C.,"New York, NY",10,178,50.0,3.0,2018-01-01,"Loud and super busy.  Order took a long time to arrive at the table, maybe they're working out the kinks in the ordering via tablet system?  Service was polite.  I would suggest you avoid dessert.  Food is still good though, like in all of these chains.  Ok for a bite when you don't feel like cooking, but don't want to go anywhere fancy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-poughkeepsie-2,,,,,
