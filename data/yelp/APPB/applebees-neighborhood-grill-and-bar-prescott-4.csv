Debbie K.,"Glendale, AZ",44,47,14,5.0,11/25/2017,"My husband and I enjoyed a late lunch. I had the original burger. I went with the side salad instead of fries. The side salad is good size with cherry tomatoes, romaine, bacon, large croutons, spinach.  All ingredients were fresh. The oriental vinaigrette dressing was delicious. The original burger comes with pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce.  The patty was juicy with an outer char. My husband said the 6oz steak was average. The cut of meat could have been better.  Broccoli and delicious loaded mashed potatoes were the sides. We are at the bar and enjoyed good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4
Nicole P.,"Tualatin, OR",38,4,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Terrible experience. I took my 3 kids there. A petite 12 year old girl and 9 and 11 year old boys. Not overweight kids by any means. They all order of the kids menu for ""super hungry"" kids aka the big kids.... When it comes I thought it was a joke. Their ""angus"" steaks looked like a piece of charcoal on a plate with 12 fries included. The stakes were literally half the size of a card deck.... it was what I would give to about a 3 year old child. And for $5.99---- if you take the kids to Red Robin or Texas Roadhouse they would get ATLEAST 3x to 4x more... hell, a kids meal for little kids from McD's would be drastically more.  I was mortified and so were my kids. I will NEVER go back. EVER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4

Jaimie L.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",45,5,,2.0,10/31/2017,"Our expectations weren't any too high starting out, it is Applebee's after all. They managed to not even meet our minimal standards. Our waitress was annoyed by our presence. Long story short, food was subpar at best and it took about ten years to get it along with the check at the end. Bathroom was filthy and didn't look like it had been cleaned at any point in the past several months.

amanda r.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,30,,5.0,8/20/2017,"We came into town from the grand canyon to go to costco, and decided to stop for dinner. Mind you, this was the 3rd restaurant we walked into. It was originally my first choice since we dont have one out where we are, but i decided to try a local place. The first restaurant made us feel too young,  and then we were going to try augies. It was awful before we ever even got drinks... so applebees it was. I was a bit leery with all the bad service reviews, but the service and the food were great. The hostess and the waitress couldn't do enough to help us.

Sally E.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",18,18,,2.0,9/11/2017,"My kids and I went to Applebee's on Saturday the eighth of September. Was so disappointed, I had the fish and chips and a regular salad and my daughter had a chicken pasta dish with a salad, and my son chose three appetizers and salad. The waiter we had was great!!! I think his name was Al, he has the long gray hair. He was so attentive and friendly if the food wasn't so bad we would go back a lot just for his service!!! The salads came on a good size plate but the salad was the size of my palm, it has tiny cut up tomatoes and looked like bacon on the top. If I knew it had tomatoes and bacon  like that I would have asked them to not put them on. I just cleaned them off and ate my tiny salad. The next thing was the fish and chips, three pieces, good size but the breading on them made the fish taste and feel slimy. I took the breading off but the fish on the top was slimy. My daughters pasta dish had no flavor but she got a good amount and my son said his was alright but it was not the best. We have been to a lot of these restaurants and have not had a problem but we sure did this day, I was very disappointed I will not be going back. I hate to write this but it was true for us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4

The best part was when the server asked if we wanted dessert and in the middle of my husband's order she just walked away. When he finally did get it ordered, she brought it (ice cream) without a spoon and we did not see her again. My husband had to eat his ice cream with his water straw! Very funny - for me anyway!

The service is pretty bad, even as I sit here on my phone writing this. We were seated directly under an air conditioning vent freezing us out. We requested to move just after ordering and were met with rolling eyes and no interest to accommodate. We moved our own drinks to a warmer table. We received our food promptly but had also within a minute after our check as well with a statement of ""of you need me let me know"" then had no other contact not even drink refreshers. We also paid the two dollars for the games at the table and they had reset the machine cancelling our games and leaving us with no way to pay. Needless to say we won't be back.

We got the bourbon chicken and shrimp that was covered in garlic butter 4 tiny shrimp. No bourbon taste at all. Two waitresses walked past my empty glass 6 times and it's not even busy. I hate eating out to experience lackluster food and poor service. I have to say watching them waitstaff smoke out front was the nail in their coffin though. I've had better food on an airplane.

Second time, no less than 6 different employees attended to us, but it seemed like none of them could figure out if they were responsible for the table. Only really pleasant one was the greeter. Food took way too long to arrive, as did drink refills.

K H.,"Prescott, AZ",0,12,,1.0,2/11/2016,Food is very mediocre but the reason for this review is my wife ordered Piña colada. She then stated it's the worst she ever had in her life. I then advised the manager who advised me that he is aware and advised they are pre-packaged Piña colada's 8 dollars for pre-packaged Piña colada's.

Last Sunday we went in for lunch and sat at the bar in the hope that the service would be better. The restaurant was less than half full with only  four other people at the bar. Sat there for six minutes and never saw the bartender. Two different servers came behind the bar to pick up glasses, looked at us sitting there empty handed, and went on their way. We walked out. I asked to speak to the manager and after waiting four minutes on her to show up, I finally left.

Dharma B.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,48,5,2.0,11/26/2014,"I so badly want to have a good experience here, I really do.  The atmosphere is comfortable, and the waitstaff is really friendly and nice.  But the management is so lacking, every time.  Even when it's not crowded there are many unbussed tables, so the hostess needs to run back and clear one off, but the others stay unclean throughout our visit.  This should not be something the hostess has to do.  Please hire more people!  Last night another waitstaff mistakenly grabbed my entrée from the kitchen for their table, so our waiter was very apologetic and resubmitted the order, and it took another 10 minutes to be served while my friends felt awkward eating without me.  Their women's restroom often badly need attention too.  Honestly, their food is quite good, their drink selection is great, and there is a wide variety overall.  I think their issues could be solved simply by hiring a few more people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4?start=40

You order more, and it takes a good 20 to 30 minutes to get it. The service is SO SLOW that you really only get one serving of the soup and salad. Not worth it. We've been there 3 times, just to be fair before writing a review, and it's the same every time. There's really no excuse for not bringing the all you can eat items out in a timely fashion.

James C.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,7,2,1.0,8/24/2014,"When we first sat down, Lindsay took our drink order - there's nothing special about ice water without lemon ... However, apparently the request of NO lemon was lost on her ... when I asked for another water w o lemon, she simply brought me back the same water out of which she had simply plucked the lemon wedge - with floating lemon particles still in the water! Do people seriously think the taste of lemon is no longer in the water?!? The all-you-can-eat ribs was certainly not worth the wait. They took almost as long each time to come out as the first time, not to mention I was never asked which flavor I wanted. I stopped asking for more simply because I was tired of waiting so long.  Another portion of our food came out stone cold. Lindsay refused to touch the food to test the temperature, claiming it would violate her status as a vegetarian. Good grief ... Overall the food was edible (for the most part), but the service was horrible and severely lacking. When we complained about the temperature of the food, no manager ever showed up to our table. Definitely NOT worth the time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4?start=40

Simple 2 burgers and wings and onion rings. By the time the food finally came we were nothing but disappointed. All my 91 yr old grandma wanted that day was a burger, she got a hard bun over done burger and wouldn't eat it.

He said I will get the menu and SHOW YOU! (me). I pointed out where he was wrong and to make a long story shorter -  this place is ugly. Long waits, rude waiters, lousy service, and the food wasn't that good. I'll not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4?start=20
D J.,"Prescott, AZ",0,34,6,1.0,9/12/2015,"This was the worst meal ever! After waiting over an hour we got nachos! I guess if you want nachos go to a Mexican restaurant! Ours had burned chips and no cheese on it for 10.29. We talked to the waitress, who was wonderful, and she got us a different order of nachos. There was a tablespoon of meat and 1 chip had cheese on it! It was piled high with lettuce so they had the appearance of being a large order. I don't ever want to go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4?start=20
Tara B.,"Fallbrook, CA",26,72,12,1.0,11/26/2015,"Linda....what a ray of sunshine...NOT! A needed a few more minutes and told her to go ahead and put my husband's order in first. We had ordered our child's meal as soon as we sat down since we hadn't eaten since breakfast. When I said I needed a few more minutes, she rolled her eyes! What adult does that? She's lucky she got a tip at all! 10% was being generous and that was only because it was Thanksgiving, not her birthday. We had to ask for refills, a box, and our check. I'm not sure that she even checked on us once. Now, let's talk about the food. Mediocre at best. Everyone's fries were cold. My husband's brisket enchiladas were pretty good. I ordered appetizers. The sirachi shrimp were good, but the chicken wonton tacos were not. I ate them, but only because we hadn't eating since breakfast, we'd been hiking, and it was Thanksgiving so I knew I wasn't going to be eating again anytime tonight. When we gave her the money for the bill, which included her gracious 10% tip she looked over at our table and glared at us. Some nerve. We should have asked for our change and only left her a penny! Management must really suck at this place. We saw workers with their hats all sideways, looking like gangsters, and the hostess half laying down while standing at the hostess stand. As a former food service worker, this would have been completely unacceptable at any of the establishments that I had bartended or waited tables at. Applebee's sucks and I won't be going back to another one, ever! I'm also sending this message to Applebee's on their website. The owners need to know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4?start=20
Mary C.,"Mayer, AZ",0,4,,1.0,1/10/2016,"The service was absolutely horrible, the food took an hour and a half to come. My drink was empty for about a half hour before the waitress bothered to come check on us. I then notice that she had been out back smoking I usually leave pretty good tips but I only gave this lady a dollar which she didn't even deserve",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-prescott-4?start=20
