Elia B.,"Atascadero, CA",15,118,233,2.0,6/5/2017,"I understand it's going to be busy because it was a Sunday and apparently it's the only place in town to celebrate birthdays.  Two many tables were dirty as we walked all the way to the back and sat by the bathrooms.  Yuck  The waiter took forever to come to our table.  We ordered everything at once ... drinks, appetizer, side salad, and entrée.  The waiter comes back saying they took away the appetizer that we wanted but hadn't changed the menu.  I told him ok, just bring my salad before the meal.  He finally returned with the whole meal. Salad and chicken strip basket.  I asked for a side plate.  He DID NOT get my salad before the meal. He brought everything together  He DID NOT get my side plate first.  He stopped and took the order from the table behind me which took 3 minutes because they couldn't make up their mind about what they wanted and he stopped next to take his coworkers order.... another 3 minutes because she ordered 4 items all in a special way.  The fries were warm not hot.  Never asked if we wanted a refill on the fries.  I asked for a large water and large coke to go. I didn't expect them free even though I ordered 2 cokes with our meal.  He brought 1 water and 1 empty cup so I could pour my left over Coke in it.  The next time I'm driving through Roseburg I'll be sure to not stop and eat anywhere around there. Wait for the next town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg

Which my family of 4 didn't mind, my 3 year old was complaining about being hungry( which we just ordered some apples for him, my 7 year old got an appetizer which didn't even come out till they finally served us our meals. Our waitress sucked, I had to ask for a fork just to start eating my salad, my husbands salmon sandwich and my burger where soggy!

Roger W.,"Grants Pass, OR",79,303,325,5.0,8/7/2015,"I have to leave a review after reading previous reviews regarding customer service and quality of food.  My wife and I came in for lunch today after honoring a Korean War Veteran at his funeral with our Patriot Guard Riders.  We were immediately greeted by a young lady and requested a table in the bar area so I could, ""yes"" watch sports center. Our waitress, Kaila immediately came to our table and took our drink orders. I ordered a bacon burger with a lettuce wrap and side salad. My wife had the BLT Croissant. The lettuce was fresh, meat cooked well and all around good.  What happened next shocked us. She asked about our PGR patches. We explained to her that we stand with our American flag for any military veteran, law enforcement or fire fighter in honor at their funerals. Kaila came back and told us that she felt humbled that we would ride into town to do this and that she bought our beverages for us. The restaurant then wanted to provide a discount to us. My wife and I were speechless. While we appreciated their generosity, we left a large tip to cover our meal and beverages but what this waitress and restaurant did was well beyond the scope of what customers should expect.  We will definitely be coming in to have our meals. The food is fresh, cooked well and the employees care about their community.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg

R.A. P.,"Coos Bay, OR",23,178,,5.0,5/11/2014,"Bring your appetite if you are ordering a burger, fries and shake because at Red Robin, the early bird does not get the worm, instead it's the customer who gets stuffed! My friend and I each ordered our variety of burgers with fries and split a shake since Red Robin's shakes are BIG.  He also added French onion soup and if you like the smell and taste of onions, you will likely enjoy their rendition of this taste treat.  Matter of fact there's a whole pile of goodies to discover on the menu and I look forward to trying others. Service has taken a hit in some reviews of the Roseburg Red Robin.  That wasn't the case when we ate there as there was the perfect level of attentiveness as well as friendliness on what was a fairly busy day in the section we sat in.  Speaking of sections, you will find this is a pretty big place that can handle a crowd but you won't feel crowded! If you want dollar menu quality you go elsewhere.  When you want real quality for both the food and service you come here.  Cheap or good.  Pick one! Now to see if Red Robin will come to Coos Bay so a meal there can be enjoyed more often.  I like this place!  Odds are you will too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=20

Pixie S.,"Salem, OR",1,18,3,5.0,7/18/2015,"Best Red Robin I've been to. Great food as always from an R.R. but the service by far surpassed any other. There were 20 in our party (including 10 kids!) and we were seated right away. Our server Julie quickly took drink orders and answered all our questions. Once we ordered she kept all the separate families (ie. checks) in order. She promptly brought everyone's food (by herself!) And included extra napkins, ranch, and condiments while refilling our drinks without being asked. She constantly checked up on all of us and continued to smile the whole 2 1/2 hours we were there, constantly bringing more drinks and fries! At the end Julie had all our checks separated perfectly and didn't even add the extra gratuity! Don't worry -- we all tipped her generously, and even got the manager to tell him how amazing Julie was!

Jinx M.,"Roseburg, OR",0,2,1,2.0,2/14/2016,"We decided to give Red Robins another chance tonight and once again left disappointed.  This location used to be our favorite restaurant in town but that is no longer the case. We ordered 2 waters, the BLTA croissant and a bacon cheeseburger with no tomatoes. Our waters were brought to us quickly but I was given a very dirty glass. I asked for a new one and it was replaced but not happily, then I realized that I had also been given dirty silverware. My husband received his bacon cheeseburger but it was just barely warm, had tomatoes on it and no mayo, when speaking to the waitress, she acted like she didn't care. At this point I was pretty pissed because I was given dirty dishes and my husbands cheeseburger was cold, and incorrect. We then spoke to the manager who also acted like he didn't care.  Treating your customers like the only thing that matters is their money is not the best way to keep repeat customers. I am a firm believer (and yes I've worked in the food industry) that if someone pays for food it should be as ordered, if a mistake is made then it should be fixed and they should at the very least apologize.  We will not be going back because the best thing about this place is their honey mustard and steak fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=20

His fish on the other hand was just okay. I had the chicken salad and the chicken was overly processed and the greens were mostly iceberg. This is a burger joint so I should have known better.

Jay M.,"Sherwood, OR",19,157,50,5.0,4/14/2013,"Stopped there for lunch on the way home on Saturday. It was just the right time after 11am and just ahead of the rush. I have eaten plenty of times at RR in Hillsboro and only twice in my own hometown of Sherwood (due to bad service). The food is always good and pretty consistent. But, this review for the RR in Roseburg, OR is mainly for service. We were seated promptly and immediately met our server. She took our drink order and reviewed specials quickly. My wife asked about the new mini-wedge salad and got great advice from the server. I asked for some fries to hit the table early and we quickly had another young man drop them off at the table. She took our orders and was super-engaged with us. Our iced tea was never empty and we had frequent check-ins to see if everything was ok. The reason I left a review is because my wife commented again on how good the service at this store was. If management reads this review, please give the opening manager and team from Saturday April 13th, 2013 a pat on the back. I would normally give my local RR barely 2-3 stars and my Hillsboro one 4 stars for their food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=40
Monica H.,"Springfield, OR",0,53,26,4.0,8/23/2011,"Yes, it's a chain, but when you want an upbeat atmosphere, good food and fast-friendly service this is a really safe bet. I'm not sure what the bad service reviews are about - I've eaten here a couple dozen times in the last couple years and have only experienced really good and friendly service. That's the one thing you can always count on... Fish and chips are great, excellent burgers and I love the BLTA. Food is always good and fresh tasting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=40
Bryan H.,"Roseburg, OR",13,4,1,1.0,12/29/2009,"I came here with my wife and 10 of her friends she went to high school with.  I ordered the swiss mushroom burger without a bun.  When our food came out I took a bite out of my burger and it was cold.  The waitress took it back and they supposedly remade my burger.  The manager brought it out to me; I took a bite and it too was lukewarm at best.  Sick of waiting, I just ate it, whatever. Once everyone was finished with their food, we stayed an chatted for an hour or so at our tables.  It was good to catch up with friends.  Some people left, some stayed as we decided what to do the rest of the night. After a bit we started to head out. One guy was in the restroom so we waited for him just inside the entrance to the Red Robin.  This is where the night began to get interesting.  The hostess stormed past us as she glared at our small group and proceeded to open the doors and hold them open implying that we were no longer welcome to stay inside the restaurant anymore.  How rude is that? Very in my opinion. So we take the hint, rude as it may be and step outside.  We continue the conversation outside.  Then a girl came outside asking one of the guys if he paid the bartender for his drink.  He did, so he said yes. It was a 3.99 MGD draft.  Then she went back inside for a minute; then out stormed the bar tender girl, basically yelling at him saying he didn't pay.  We all stayed calm but she was frantic. I intervened and said that I didn't like the way she was talking to my friend.  That's when she go rude with me.  I was dumbstruck.  Even more so when my friend agreed to pay again.  Then the bartender said it was time for us to leave and she was calling the cops. WHOA! ARE YOU SERIOUS? Let me talk to your manager I replied.  I met Rico. He seemed polite and concerned.  I told him everything that I wrote here plus more that I probably forgot by now.  Glad he was understanding.  The way the staff acted was no way to treat 2 Navy servicemen.  Hope they read this because maybe they will find out that they treated 2 men of honor and respect like bums, high school kids, and thieves.  They made a big mistake, thus they are forgiven.  Customer service was nonexistent. Stay clear of this establishment. Sorry Rico; hope you fix this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=40

James H.,"Eugene, OR",0,19,,1.0,5/4/2013,"Not only does this pathetically managed restaurant take corporate greed to a new level, when confronted with it they smile. Example: order what I am told is a pint of beer, I get it and it is short two inches from the top. The manager, dickh@*d something, tells me when I insist that I ordered and paid for a pint that I get a pint. He smirks and shows me some silly glass corporate barons of Red Robin give as example of how to pour draft beer. It is two inches below the rim, both on the 16 oz and the 22 oz. So they are basically ripping you off. Also, got the wrong burger, service was, well white trash kinda stuff but then what can you expect from Roseburg, Oregon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=40

Keleen W.,"Glendale, OR",3,17,4,4.0,5/17/2009,"I had the pleasure of ordering one of the Whiskey BBQ Chicken Salads for lunch the other day.  What a great choice!  I am not a fan of onions, but the onion straws on this salad are just right...the salad also had avacado, black beans, chicken, corn, cheese and more...it was great, filling and also had a couple of pieces of their tasty garlic bread.  ...that and a strawberry lemonade filled the bill.  Did I say Bill? Make sure and get those free refills on your strawberry lemonade...it will set you back about $4.60...ouch...but soooo good.  The service was good, the atmosphere was good.  Exactly what you would expect in a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=40
