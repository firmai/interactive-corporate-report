Basia M.,"Dillsburg, PA",2,27,1,4.0,6/21/2015,"This Red Robin was a good place to go for a late lunch this week.  Food was tasty, server was pleasant.  The modern music was not too loud.  There are TVs throughout, but it didn't seem that the sound was on, which is FINE by me! We ate in the bar section where there are no kids.  The price was fair.  I would not hesitate to return.  Plenty of parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Steve S.,"Asheville, NC",14,166,,3.0,11/28/2012,"If you have been to one Red Robin, you've been to 'em all. I had lunch here today.  I'm on a diet, and I was able to get a burger and side (black beans) that were diet-friendly. They overcooked my burger, but I'm not surprised.  Most places can't cook a burger with a pink center.  The few that can get the best reviews from me. Overall, the food was really good.  Service was good, too.   So, good.  It beats fast food anyday. They have Xmas music playing in the restaurant, including the restrooms.  In the mens' room, there is a small TV with a sports show playing.  When I went in the restroom, I listened to ""We Wish you a Merry Xmas"", competing with some lunatic ranting about sports teams on the TV.  It sounded crazy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Chris R.,"Brick, NJ",9,89,,4.0,3/25/2013,"Stopped here for lunch with the family on the way to Cleveland Ohio. Snowy day so they weren't busy at all.  Ordered delicious burgers and nice they have alternate sides besides French fries. Only negative was their lemonade with strawberries was very small, but service was top notch. Will stop in again if in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Jim T.,"Bridgeport, WV",6,87,20,5.0,6/21/2014,Best place for the kids in Carlisle. The food is great and service is top notch. Love the Cobb salad and a beer. The fries are endless so I usually get some sweet potato fries as a side. The lines can be long when it's busy but they move fast.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Michael A.,"Palo Alto, CA",41,9,,4.0,7/29/2014,"I had the Cobb salad...it was good, but nothing special. After all this is a burger joint. Great, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Craig H.,"Washington, DC",89,400,1064,1.0,7/29/2013,"Good grief. All I need is the appetizer served before the meal, a decent burger, and don't let my ice tea glass get empty. 1 star. The burger was good.  Enough said.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
J H.,"Carlisle, PA",62,5,,5.0,6/10/2014,The food is good. One of the best burger and fries in Carlisle. Service has always been good. Their new computer table top things do drive me crazy.  But the kids night rocks. And throw in a birthday celebration on a kids night double bonus !!  They let you bring in a cake and line the table with balloons!!  And the kids are instantly entertained by the great red bird!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
B C.,"Hawthorne, NJ",102,178,5,3.0,7/6/2014,I have to give kudos to Red Robin for letting me take control of my order and pay my check.  The staff was too busy doing other things anyways so it made the mediocre chain food bearable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Steve P.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",225,400,1029,4.0,6/2/2010,"Middle of the day, and you'd think they were closed. Fiancee and I were out and about, got a hankerin for a Banzai Burger and we pulled into the empty parking lot.  Everything looked rather empty during our approach until a server opened the door for us, you could tell it was a slow day.  She walked behind the hosts station grabbed some menus and showed us to our table, and then informed us she would also be our server. Nothing like doing everything yourself eh?  Onion rings, Banzai Burger, Chicken Wrap and clam chowder was the order. Actually the onion rings were what starting the whole craving in the first place. They are awesome here, crunchy breading, big slices of sweet onions, (think they are Vidalias') We always ask them to give us a side of ranch dressing to go along with their standard dipping sauce which is a bbq/mayo mix. Due to the slowness of the day the food came out really quickly . Cooked properly we ate everything. Our server kept the drinks filled and made sure we were taken care of. Which really given the time of  day wasn't a great feat. We were the only other customers in the building. Summing it up, it was a good lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Sam B.,"Philadelphia, PA",74,431,108,4.0,4/18/2013,"I like this location, service is fast, and the food is not bad for a chain",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Beth G.,"Mount Holly Springs, PA",3,120,32,4.0,12/5/2011,"We went for a family dinner out and wow, was our server forgetful.  She kept messing up our order and forgetting items.  So I recommend the place because the burgers are awesome, but I hope you get a good server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle?start=20
Eric C.,"Erie, PA",5,5,9,5.0,8/5/2017,"We arrived and were seated immediately. Our server greeted us and explained the drink options. We order a Starter Appetizer, selecting deep fried cheese curds and jalapeno slices. They were delightful with assorted cheeses and the jalapeno slices had just the right amount of heat. My plan is to try all of the Red Robin burgers, so this time I picked the Madlove burger. I was perfectly cooked to medium, and loaded with topping including citrus infused Tomato and onions, a pamesan cheddar cheese crisp, truly decedent. The fries were hot and crisp. My Samuel Adams Summer Ale was ice cold and a perfect pairing. Great service great food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
D H.,"Mt Holly Springs, PA",3,126,11,1.0,12/5/2017,"So I have been here several times in the past.  They are GF aware and their burgers are OK.  But the prices continue to go up and every time I go they seem to take more and more time to get your food to you.  We went here over weekend as a last minute decision because we were in that area for other things. We were seated in the aisle half booth things, which I hate.  I asked if we could get an actual booth and we were told they didn't have any available.  The next two groups of people that came in were seated in booths.  This was within 2 mins of us being seated.  Upset me but I didn't say anything. We ordered drinks, and then food when the wait staff brought our drinks, which was pretty quick.  Of course we waited a long time for our food.  I'm not sure exactly how long, but we asked the wait staff about it twice before it finally came out. They brought our food and we all started to eat and my wife said something about her plate being dirty.  We all looked at our plates and 3 out of 4 were actually used plates.  I had crusted ketchup on mine... We said something to the wait staff and they apologized and said they would get the manager.  The manager came over and apologized and offered to remake our food.  We said we didn't have time for that.  And the manager asked if we had any appetizers, we said no and then they asked if we were getting any deserts, we said no.  And then asked if we wanted any deserts to go.  We said no.  They apologized again and then left.  We ate some of the food that wasn't touching the plates and left.  I paid the bill in full.  They didn't discount it, take one or two of our meals off, or give any sort of coupon for next time or anything like that.  I guess it's OK to give your customers dirty (USED) dishes, do nothing about it and expect people to come back.  BTW my burger (GF lettuce wrap) was way too spicy and it shouldn't have been (I scraped the sauce off of it) and they basically burned the burger, I asked for med.... They can keep their $15 burgers.  That was the last time I will be seen in a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
Bob C.,"Holden, MA",0,10,,2.0,1/14/2018,"We've stopped here on our north and south , twice a year, for the last 3 years. We pick Red Robin because they have a GF menu, my wife has celiac disease. We frequently stop at Red Robin's, up and down the East Coast for that reason. As usual the food is consistent and good, but the service is beyond bizarre. We came at 3 on a Sunday with, maybe, 3 tables in use. Waited almost 6-7 minutes for someone to show up at the check in. My wife ordered a Sangria; a Margarita was served and we needed to argue with the waitress that a Margarita and a Red Sangria weren't the same thing. We will continue to eat at Red Robin just not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
Heidi K.,"Boiling Springs, PA",25,37,25,2.0,5/7/2017,"Although the food is good, the wait to receive your food, even without being a special order, or busy, is ridiculous!!!  A $13 burger that you wait an hour for delivered to the table lukewarm is not a reason to return, regardless of the updated decor ---the kitchen service is lacking. The burger was burnt and cold. Yummy? I think not. Those interactive kiosks are great-if the bloody thing is not running out of charge...blinking an obnoxious red light every other second, the entire time, and then dying while I'm processing payment. Lovely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
Allison H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",135,329,670,3.0,12/6/2016,"Much better food preparation than the Mechanicsburg location, but painfully slow service.  Red Robin is great for the family and the burger choices are insane! I could never get tired of burgers at RR.  I like that they have a full bar, and a menu that caters to all. Their apps are good too. I highly recommend trying their featured burgers. Very clever fixings make for a fun eating experience.  Overall, don't come here expecting amazing service. Expect to wait and hey, it's a good burger joint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
Bob K.,"Independence, MO",0,11,1,3.0,8/3/2017,The service was outstanding and the Tavern double burger was delicious. The portion size was perfect. The disappointing part of the whole meal was the sweet potato fries. They came out ice cold the first time then under cooked (but hot) the second time. I was not told there was an up charge for sweet potato fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
Adam O.,"Carlisle, PA",54,133,95,4.0,12/2/2015,"We love Red Robin and this location offers everything we've come to expect from this chain.  Gourmet burgers, endless fries, and a cool atmosphere make this place a fun place to spend an hour or two with family or friends. I enjoy the Red's Tavern Double (essentially a gourmet McDouble with 1000 Island dressing for sauce).  With my bottomless fries, I enjoy the variety of dipping sauces, though at $0.75 a cup for the specialty sauces, it can quickly add up if you sample too many in one sitting. At this location, I've noticed that our servers often take their time refilling bottomless fries after the initial delivery with my burger.  It may be in my head, but also feel that subsequent fry deliveries are a lower quality than the first round.  Overall, after the initial order is delivered (usually quick, but occasionally not), service tends to be hit or miss. Either way, my wife and I will always enjoy this location, as it offers the area a nice restaurant variety that is sorely lacking on this side of Carlisle!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
Kay B.,"SOUTHEASTERN, PA",69,208,76,4.0,10/10/2015,"I was thoroughly impressed! This isn't a fancy shmancy place, they're not trying to be. It's a family-friendly casual sit down joint.  The atmosphere is lovely, but there's a bit too many hanging TVs in your face EVERYWHERE. There's odd decorations all over like a carousel and vintage photos. The service was friendly and we didn't need to wait long to be seated, in fact not at all. On the tables there's computers to signal for your server's attention, order drinks and review some of their specials. There's probably more it can do, I just didn't care to explore. The smoke burger and clucks (breaded chicken fingers) & chips (steakhouse fries) were delicious. The fries - steakhouse-style or sweet potato - are bottomless.  The smoke burger was 1/2 lb., juicy and tasty. It's cooked to temp, but in our case did not come out medium, though it wasn't worse for the ware. It comes on ciabatta bread, but don't be fooled the breads not typical crispy ciabatta. It's much softer. The clucks were sooo good. Not greasy. Very crispy. Perfectly breaded! Yum! Oh and the honey mustard and BBQ sauces I ordered for my clucks were also perfect. Honey mustard has poppy seed in it and BBQ sauce was smokey. They're not model citizens for healthy, but there's some healthier options available like salads and wraps. I wouldn't bother. I'd just go for what they're known for....burgers and clucks!...though I'm sure the other options are equally tasty. They serve adult beverages, but their beer selection is weak; limited to the most popular stuff and missing any craft brew options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle

Melissa P.,"Sunbury, PA",3,22,16,2.0,3/17/2016,"Never had an issue before.  But we went in tonight and it was really bad.   The soup we order cakes 20 minutes after we arrived, and that was rushed out after complaining.  It was French onion soup and did not even look like it!  It had no bread in it, the cheese was thrown in it and the side bread was burnt!

Ryan D.,"Carlisle, PA",6,101,,1.0,3/13/2017,Not happy. Food was cold. waste of money. management was not gotten a hold of when I  said how disappointed  that I  was.

Brittany C.,"Carlisle, PA",0,3,,2.0,8/9/2016,"My family and I enjoy Red Robin, however, the service at the Carlisle location is disappointing.

Michael D.,"Oshawa, Canada",15,91,142,4.0,11/29/2014,"When you're looking for a fast, consistent meal, with a lot of selection and great service, it's hard to find better than Red Robin.  As with all the other locations, the menu is huge, and has something for everyone - making it a great choice for work lunches.  The menu has lots of healthy choices, as well as some awesome gourmet burgers that taste great.  Drinks are huge (pint glasses), which is a nice touch from other chains that give you a small plastic cup of beverage for the same price. Service has been consistently good at this location - drinks and fries are always refilled promptly and I've never had an issue with my order.  Wait times even at noon are usually under 5 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle

John G.,"Camp Hill, PA",80,246,109,4.0,12/6/2011,"Went in for a late lunch. Place was not crowded so we got to sit right down. Wife had the fish sandwich and I had the BBQ Chicken. We both enjoyed it and we ordered more fries. Their endless fries seems to be a necessity as they only give you 13&1/2 to begin with. To our surprise our waitress brought over a big basket of fries when we ordered more. This was unexpected because other Red Robins usually only give you about the same amount as with your regular order. I actually felt bad that we couldn't finish all the fries. But we did leave full. Our waitress was very pleasant the whole time we were there and very attentive even though she had other tables to handle.  She could do well in a better restaurant. It was a good experience at a chain restaurant hot food, plenty of it, and a pleasant attentive waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carlisle
