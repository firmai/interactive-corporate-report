28,Desiree D.,"New Haven, CT",172,421,581.0,1.0,2012-03-19,"Sorry if this is long, I am going to say sorry to start off..... OK. The break down is simple: If you like a nice cocktail / happy hour with your friends, and are on a budget, you should go here.  If you like to wait hours for useless service and no attentive staff, go here. OK this is the story: On a very NOT busy Sunday around 1 pm, myself and 4 other adults and one child went here to get some lunch. The place looked very understaffed, and they went to go seat us but told us to wait so they could put some tables together. Turns out they put the tables together, then never told us and we waited around for 10 minutes. Then some kid walks up to us and goes ""OH , your table is already set up""... Thanks. We sit down and have the worst service ever. It took the waitress 15 minutes to even come see us. As we sat down, a table with a small child and two adults said ""you should leave now, we have been here for 2 1/2 hours"" We should have listened. We ordered some cocktails from the menu and noticed quickly that the bar was empty. There were 2 bartenders, and it took almost 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive. At one point I became so irritated, I asked our waitress what the hold up was. She said that people called out and they were short staffed. NO...really? hmm.. So we ordered our food after patiently waiting for our food. We waited..and waited...it took over an hour to get our food. Remind you, the food for the baby was ordered, simple chicken fingers and fries, and ended up coming first , we were all so hungry we ate almost all of her food while we waited and waited for ours. What a horrible place this is, I can't even put it into words. LOL. Anyways, we finally get our food and my boyfriend has a HUGE hair in his burger...IN his burger. My food was cold and gross, and the others did not enjoy theirs either. This experience was so bad, I e-mailed them via their website, and the manager called me to ask me about what happened. He ended up saying TGI's was sending me a $50.00 voucher in the mail, and he was sending one personally too. ( I explained a million times to him this was not my intention, I just wanted to tell him that it was horrible and nobody with a baby should have to wait this long to eat).  He sent me one,but the ""corporate"" didn't. I never got it. The manager went on to explain that that day they were short staffed, and many people called out. He went on to say that he used my e-mail as a example of what ""not to do"" and had an immediate staff meeting regarding all of my issues. I will never eat here again.

53,Steve W.,"New Haven, CT",0,3,,4.0,2012-03-29,"I am a regular of this establishment and I just wanted to defend this restaurant.  I have been coming here for years.  The food is usually piping hot and comes out correct.  If it doesn't, I send it back and it gets fixed.  No big deal.  Remember, nobody is perfect.   I get fantastic service on a consistent basis.   Oh, regarding the woman that came on the day they were understaffed... Obviously things take a long time if a restaurant is understaffed.  A restaurant isn't just allowed to close the doors.  The Show must go on.  Trust me, I used to own one.  No one forced you to stay when you waited 15 minutes to even see the waitress.  That's when you should leave, not after waiting 30 minutes for drinks or an hour for food.  Come on people! Use common sense.  One more thing.  If people leaving an establishment are telling you not to come in because they waited a long time that's a fairly good indicator that you shouldn't risk waiting if you have kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=40,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128,2.128
54,Ariana M.,"Hamden, CT",2,15,,1.0,2012-04-07,"My fiancee has always liked this kind of food. Not a fan myself. Yesterday was his birthday, so I called to reserve a table for 12. No reservations. Ok, I will just come a little earlier to make sure the table is ready. I brought a lovely cake from Ashley's(5 stars btw) and some candles and handed them over to the hostess. It goes downhill from there. The waiter was awful. He was hardly ever around and when he was he only talked about the Yankees game that was playing. My fiancee's steak had been burned to death, the rice and veggies looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for the past hour. We would have sent it back, but again our waiter was no where to be found, even though they did not appear to be busy that night. After waiting for 30 minutes with no cake, no nothing. I asked for the check which he was happy to bring over. And he did bring, just the check. 20 minutes after that, when he came to pick up the check I told him to just bring out the cake with to go boxes. We ate my fiancee's cake out of styrofoam with the dirty remains of the entrees still all over the table. Happy Birthday baby!

We usually sit in the booths that are in the bar and have had some really great servers.  They do good happy hours - normal time, late night and ALL DAY Sundays. Yay! Additionally, I should mention that I signed up for the ""Stripes"" Reward program about a year ago.  Each time I go in I just show my ""Stripes"" card and I immediately get chips & salsa for free.  In addition to that they are constantly sending me coupons for 25% off my entire bill.

I'm from long island and moved to hamden a little over a year ago. I've been to TGIF plenty of times where I'm from and never experienced on like this before. Maybe hamden natives are slobs or the managers here just don't give a crap and don't clean the place. But besides that, I literally just walked out of there half an hour ago. We were sat down at a disgusting table. The place was not crowded by ANY means and we were at our table for 15 minutes and no one had come by to even just take our drink orders. We just left and came across the street to Chili's which is spotless, and got served immediately. I'll never go back to that TGIF.

Furthermore, they were not even busy.  The waitress then proceeded to say she will take it off the bill.  Duh... if we did not get it did they expect us to pay for it?  I think what really ticked me off is the table right across from our ordered the same appetizer and it came out quickly and their main dishes came out in under 30 minutes.

I ordered a philly stacked burger expecting not too much could go wrong with a burger. Boy, was I wrong.  First, it took forever and a day to be waited on and for the food to come out of the kitchen, late night, on a Tuesday, with all of maybe 2 other tables there.  When my food finally came,  I took a couple bites of my burger before i bit into something questionable. I disassembled the burger to find something that resembled either pork or chicken. What worried me is that I am allergic to chicken. When the waitress finally came back, I asked her nicely to check to see if there was any other meat in the burger other than beef as well as vocalizing that it may be chicken and informing her of my allergy. Again she disappeared for a while, and when she finally came back she informed me that it must be just  a  mushroom,  she did not offer to replace my meal, she did not offer to comp it, she just walked off. Now, I saw the mushrooms in my now disassembled burger, and that did not look like mushrooms. I asked other's at my table, they concurred, this was not a mushroom. She didn't say a word and just left. When she came back to collect everyone's dishes she took the burger, which I had taken all of 2 bites out of and didn't say a word.  I was disgusted at how nonchalantly this issue was taken. It was late, I was tired and now concerned of how much of this ""mystery""product I had ingested and what it was, and I didn't feel like arguing it with a manager, and even though I should have.

14,Ann Marie L.,"Wallingford, CT",36,13,,2.0,2016-01-29,"Alright, let me start with how badly I've wanted to come back here. I used to love Fridays years ago. Around 2 years ago I came with friends for trivia and happy hour and it was great. This time, however, was very different. I had a gift certificate so I wanted to go for dinner. I tried something new - the salmon and Langostino lobster. We waited over 40 minutes and when my food arrived, it was just salmon with a very small amount of some kind of cream sauce. It was supposed to come in an Alfredo sauce with mushrooms as well as the lobster. I was confused and asked my server, and he said it was his error when I ordered and that it was a lobster SAUCE. I shrugged and ate my food anyway thinking I had misread the description. It wasn't bad, but not what I had expected. Halfway through my meal I decided to look it up online - I was right. It said it came with sautéed lobster in an Alfredo sauce with mushrooms. So now I was annoyed.  On top of the entirely wrong order, I had a side of ""mac and cheese"" ... I use quotes because penne with cheese sprinkled on top is NOT Mac and cheese. It was also over cooked. Ew.  My boyfriend said his meal was good, but in my opinion it didn't look that great. It at least was not presented well, it looked like it was just slapped on the plate.  In my error, I really should've harassed the server about my meal more thoroughly. At least to get some of the price taken off - I paid for a meal with lobster and got only the salmon half. In the end I was too annoyed to bother him a second time when I was already almost finished with my meal.  So I will not go back. Food was less than ""eh"", way too long of a wait time, and errors with my meal. It is really disappointing as I had so many memories in that restaurant from years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

6,Terry B.,"New Haven, CT",0,6,,2.0,2017-08-04,"Today i decided i wanted to have some TGIF, it been over 6 years to 8 since i had it , and i use to go with my friends  to the one in hamden, at the time which was great. until today, today i order Bruschetta Chicken Pasta, Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta, Loaded potato skins and the Caesar Salad with Breadstick with Caesar Dressing, Well, i will start off that i was only doing a take out order. (which took 40 mins instead of 15 mins to get) but i will admit the person who took my order was very nice and sweet.  very professional .   i will start with the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta, and pasta,  when i first opening  it for my family it look good but when i tasted the chicken, it was a bit odd,  flavored was a bit weird, and the chicken tasted  over cooked but not the best..  but at least the food was hot when i got home. Bruschetta chicken and pasta, "" normally, i wouldn't mind how the food looks at first, but i felt like someone just threw pasta with a super small piece of chicken, that was thinly slice  into 4 strips,(as if they are trying to save chicken ) then one small chunk of chicken,  i was really highly disappointed not just that i order the full not the half serving  and still felt like, the person  who order the cajun shrimp still had the equal amount as i did with the full serving. the sauce was good at least, but  over all it wasn't something i would tell my other friends about. Now the bread sticks, i have to say the bread sticks was the best out of all of it.  so i didn't have to much to say   which is why i gave it two stars. potato skins, I would say i kinda enjoy the  potato skins but i felt like i got  more potato then bacon  and cheese,   even tho i did say i wanted broccoli on my potato skins but instead i got it on the side,  but i will add the broccoli came out very good tho. at the end i didn't mind eating it  the way it was a bit burnt but it didn't bother me that much.  Now i saved the best for last, the Ceasar salad, there so much i could say, but i will keep it short, the salad had nothing in it but 4 or 5 bread crumbs. nothing in it beside lettuce, and  a few flakes of cheese  you can tell that the person didn't put his heart into the food, or he seem to lost his passion..  I really hope fridays, change there ways, bring back the good food they use to. from years ago. i don't know what happen over the years. but i seriously hope you  guys talk it out or something. see whats going on in the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

My father ordered a Medium Rib Eye Steak with Sauteed Shrimp.  10 minutes later, a different waitress came over and asked if someone ordered a side Caesar Salad. I took it but before I could ask anything, she hurried back into the kitchen. Our waitress never came by to ask how the salad was, if we got utensils, or update on our food.  The table near us ordered endless apps and they even put in an additional order that they received before we got anything. 40 minutes later, our waitress came by saying that there was an error with the computer and that our original order was never processed, but they put the order in now. I told her that I waited 30 minutes for her to come back to ask about utensils, but her lack of attention to us caused us to leave.  I think her dependency on the machine caused her unable to solve a problem. She didn't even apologize. She said her manager was going to come by to talk to us.

Yeah, thanks, the host is clearly more competent at your job.  We waited quite a while for our food, especially given the lack of business. When it came, my boyfriend remarked at the lack of fries given. He loved the burger though. Hello, one star. I got a salad and, although tasty, the lettuce was wilted. Speaking of lettuce, the menu says romaine and kale? Hah. No kale. Not one piece of kale.  Now, our over-achieving server doesn't come by to see how things are, so she wouldn't know that my boyfriend was in desperate need of napkins, as he was covered in burger juices.

The manager came over and assured me that  Everything is prepped fresh in the morning. They took it away and another manager came over to me and asked what happened and I told him. He gave me the same paper coupon I got the last time. I am now going to contact the TGI Fridays corporate headquarters. Somebody needs look into that location in Hamden Connecticut.
