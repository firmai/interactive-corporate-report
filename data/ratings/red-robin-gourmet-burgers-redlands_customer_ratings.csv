179,Jing P.,"Berkeley, CA",37,31,,4.0,2012-05-26,"Delicious. Good. Yum. Endless calories but I don't mind... Best Bites: (1) Whiskey River BBQ burger (2) Royal Red Robin burger (3) Banzai Burger (4) Sauteed Shroom For a place that touts itself as gourmet, Red Robin really does have some neat and inspired surprises tucked into each burger. For example, the Royal Red Robin burger is topped with a fried egg, which sounds preposterous but adds an extra layer of delicious, unexpected richness to the burger. The Banzai is another one of my all-time favorites, with teriyaki sauce playing off of a grilled piece of tangy pineapple. The endless fries are also insanely good -- thick, fluffy slices of potato packed with different seasonings and fried till they are crispy golden. Definitely worth the money, just beware -- these burgers are on the heavy/rich side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands?start=160,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.6000000000000005

I ordered the fish and chips which were great, the batter was crispy and light. Upon close inspection, the top half of my water glass was dirty. Kind of really off-putting.

I love going to different Red Robins to see all the different settings, though they're all pretty similar.  This one is a little smaller than most I've been to. There is way less space to walk even though there's plenty of seating perfect for big groups and a small date. Top Burger Recommendations: Whiskey BBQ Burger && Quac Bacon Burger Surprisingly their FISH & CHIPS are a pretty safe bet here at RR. They give you a lot, compared to most restaurants, 4 giant fried pieces of cod and ENDLESS FRIES!!! It's filling for me and I often have to share. If you wan an appetizer, I'd recommend getting a single/double combo of stuff found on the front of their menu. This stuff will always be cheaper and they won't completely fill you up before your meal. Safer bet, even if there are a lot of people in your group. Only BAD thing was that our waitress hovered too much. She checked on us every 2 minutes and barely let us eat.  I think its great to provide customers with great and friendly service, but it was TOO much.

My boyfriend and I had a server that did this...poorly. Before he even left our table after taking our order, he basically asked us to repeat various parts of our order about 3 times.

We ordered the peppercorn burger and bowl of clam chowder. The place was new and clean and the service was good but it took some time for the order to come out. (20-25 min) The burger was huge and came with their signature fries. The burger was decent but it didn't have much flavor. The sauce was mild even though there was peppercorn sauce. I did like that it was lean and not very greasy at all. The soup wasn't bad especially on a cold winter day but it was too watery. I liked the focaccia bread it came with.

The BLTA croissant is also very good and the french dip is better than most. The service is always good and the prices are reasonable.

There is nothing inherently good or bad about chains and/or family-owned businesses. I don't get this. It's illogical. So if food in mediocre at a family-owned single location restaurant, I'm supposed to eat there instead of the chain with better food? Sorry, but that's just dumb.

I figured she was just distracted by the other 3 patrons but after 10 mins of listening to their delightful conversations, I decided I was being ignored.

191,Kathi C.,"Crestline, CA",7,6,,2.0,2013-03-12,"We go here often & are usually pleased but last weekend changed my opinion. We had a large group of 18 planning on getting together. I called 4 days in advance to notify them & set up reservations. The manager refused to take down my name saying, ""We already have 2 large groups at that time. 5 o clock is very busy for us. You will have to just put your name in and wait your turn"". He then hung up on me!  When we got there Saturday at 5 it was busy like usual. We had to wait about 15min. They gave us only 1 waitress. She took our drink order in a timely manor. We all got our drinks pretty quickly except my friend that ordered coffee. She waited until our food came. Usually they will bring you fries after you order your food but not this day. When our food came most of it was correct but one of my friends order was completely wrong. When she told the waitress she apologized saying she would bring the correct food. It never came. My husband split a burger with a friend and they gave him 5, yes only 5 fries! We asked for more 3 times before they came.  Our food was good and far as I know everyone's food was hot. We never got more fries even though we asked several times.  I usually drink water when we go out but because the water is so horrible at this Red Robin I am forced to drink something else. I ordered a Speckled Lemon aid. It was good but went very fast. I asked for a refill 3 times. She finally brought it in a to go cup as we were leaving. My coffee drinking friend never got a coffee refill. One really good thing was she didn't stick us with the usual large group gratuity. We would have spoken to the manager at that point. I will probably go here again as we really do enjoy their food but I will think twice before taking a large group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands?start=180,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.3360000000000003,3.92

It seems like every other commercial  was Red Robin's  referring to their bottomless fries.  I never cared for Red Robin prior to this. I had nothing against them, it was just that if I wanted a burger I would go else where. I didn't even know that it was Red Robin Gourmet Burgers. I just knew them as Red Robin. But when you can only drink soup for 3 1/2 weeks and the same commercial keeps telling you to eat their fries, your willpower is shot. Once my doctor said you can ""probably"" eat a burger now.... probably was good enough for me! I was off to Red Robin!! Granted I was still sore and my mouth hadn't fully healed but I was dying to eat something other than soup and protein shakes. They were advertizing the Berserker Burger because of the new Wolverine movie and I decided to get that. My server was nice and cute. I wish I knew her name. It sounded middle eastern. or Indian. She took care of me and I think she was even the bartender that day.  The burger was good. I couldn't enjoy it like I wanted because my mouth decide that ""probably"" wasn't enough and I got sore fast. Also, chewing on the opposite side that you normally chew on is like using your left hand if you are right handed. (Or right hand if you are left handed for you south paws). it isn't something you think about until you have too... I couldn't even enjoy the bottomless fries. :( I have to go back to redeem my mouth, and of course give them another chance. it isn't their fault my mouth was hurt.

60,Matt H.,"Yucaipa, CA",533,251,1722.0,4.0,2013-10-16,"What could I possibly say about this Red Robin? Let's see... I've been coming here for years; heck, ever since this location opened up in what is known today as Citrus Plaza. In those few years I've had some great times and some displeasurable times here. I have always loved Red Robin and their burgers. I've tried many, many different ones. Sometimes, when the mood has struck me, I have even crossed over into their chicken sandwich territory and both have been good as a whole. To say that I have never had a few problems or hiccups here regarding food or service is an understatement. This place is NOT perfect, which in reality is fine because no place is. What this Red Robin does very well is the way they carry themselves and their level of customer service. Out of all the times I have had issues here, every single one of them has been made right and as a patron I certainly appreciate that. So, as such, I will keep coming back to partake of their tasty food. Some tips- Most peeps get the bottomless fries or garlic fries as a side w/ their burger or sandwich, but you can also sub that out for either bottomless cole slaw, broccoli, or salad. Also, don't think that the burger creations they have listed on their menus are set in stone; you have the power to customize your burgers as you see fit. My personal go to is a Banzai Burger on an onion bun w/ pickles, onion straws, and an egg added. Bar booths and seating are generally first come first serve. My real only gripe (not w/ this particular location, but w/ the Red Robin chain as a whole) is that lately it feels to me that Red Robin is starting to become a bit to pretentious. I mean, I miss the days of the simple, fold out menus w/ the burgers served in a basket. Now the menus look like some you'd find at The Cheesecake Factory and their burgers are served on these ""fancy"" red plates w/ the fries served in a metal cylindrical container adjacent to the burger.

The server was so pleasant and interacted with the 2 yr old. As for the food, no one at my table was feeling it. We had spaghetti, kid pizza, fries, and the uhhhhh chicken burger that's one of the big items... some kind of bbq or jack daniels or something. They have it in chicken, hamburger, and a wrap. Nothing we ordered was impressive. I'm not sure how much we paid because I didn't see the bill but I think a hamburger/fry meal is about $10-$14. The endless fries are a pretty good deal too.

We ordered and out food was served nice and hot and fresh, the only thing she missed to bring us was an appetizer that we order the onion rings, but she immediately apologize and told us that it would come as soon as possible. Then within no time she brought the onion rings and told us she would removed them from our check. It was really nice of her to do that. One of the things I really like about this restaurant was the service she came at least 6 times to ask us if we were doing fine, my son want it more mandarines and she said she could bring him more.

Went in for an early dinner & it wasn't busy, so I figured we'd get good service.  It started out that way, then as we finished our ""bottomless"" fries, our waitress didn't show up for awhile.. so we were patient & waited quite awhile.  Finally saw her at the bar, socializing with the bartender so I walked over there & asked for more fries.  Nobody should have to do that, especially if you're going to advertise bottomless fries! Here's where the fun begins: Got the bill, paid cash for it, waitress returns with my change.   I count my change which turned out to be $5 short.  I flag her down & tell her she short changed me.  She looks at all the bills laid out & IMMEDIATELY says ""Oh, I forgot to include $5!""  So she opens her change purse & hands me a $5 bill.  NO hesitation whatsoever, of how much she short changed me.  What does that mean?!   She obviously knew exactly how much she short changed/STOLE !!   I gave it back to her well that's your tip. But as we were leaving, I REALLY wish I had not given her that much.  I was just feeling generous I guess, & a food coma coming on. Moral of the story: BE SURE to count your change & beware of waitresses such as ours..(Diane). Not only is she a dishonest waitress, but an awful actress at that.  She made it way too obvious that she ""forgot/stole"" money from me.  I understand it was only $5, but it's the principle. Bad.

They told us it would be 20 to 30 minutes for our table to be ready because of the size of our group. Fifty minutes later we were seated at the table. It took a while to be attended to by our waitress, but once she showed up, she did quite well by our large group. I'm not going to bother describing the meals that were ordered, but suffice it to say that it was basic burgers and fries and a salad or two. Overall, I would likely never choose to come here short of my burger being free. This location is as good as any of the Red Robins that I've been to, I'm just not impressed by the chain. I think Five Guys and In N Out offer better burgers than this chain does and would personally rather eat at either of those restaurants instead.

Husband ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger and it was gone in seconds! We also ordered two tall Stellas which were great. The main lacking aspect was the kids meal. The cheeseburger was really really dry. Definitely needed some condiments and needed to not be well done right from the gate. Oddly enough the fries, which I hear so much about, came out room temp instead of freshly hot, but the seasoning salt helped it out a lot. And lastly we ordered dessert, which I definitely would not order again (though that's just based on taste preferences not the item itself). We ordered the Chocolate Fruffles which was basically a cold brownie dipped in dark chocolate, not what my sweet tooth was looking for at all.

44,Monica M.,"Upland, CA",135,548,608.0,1.0,2016-02-06,"We came here on a Saturday afternoon to the bar area to get some lunch. At first everything seemed to be going pretty well. Service was okay, we ordered promptly, and the food came out rather quickly, but here's where it went South: The burgers were not cooked as we ordered, since we asked for medium and received rather well done burgers... Sooooooo someone tell the chef to go back culinary school.  The bottomless fries that came with our overcooked burgers seemed more like a garnish, since they literally gave us a small handful for two people. The main reason we came here was for their bottomless fries, so there goes that.  The blond, blue eyed waitress we had must have been a magician because that girl disappeared for our entire stay.  Not once were we offered refills... We had to use bus boys and other waitresses to try to get her to come to our table. Once the bus boy got her to come to us, after waiting for her for 30 mins, she came and asked what we needed... Really? So we asked for water and some fries, and she turned away, mid-sentence, to walk away from us, so I had to say, hey hold on, we aren't done ordering! Wtf???  Anyway, so she left, came back, yep, you guessed it, with no fries or sauce, just water. Mind you, that was my second glass of water throughout our entire stay. Meanwhile, we decided to pay via the little prompt/pay machine they have at the bar, which by the way, you can use to call your server over... Which we did, and no, she never came. Lovely. So anyway, we pay, and no receipt comes out. Alright. So when she came back with the water, she was carrying a bunch of receipts, and asked us which amount was ours and what we paid with. Ummm isn't that your job?? After we gave her that info, we never even got a receipt. Well, since we had told her we wanted more fries and sauce, we hoped she would come back with those after the receipt fiasco. But something even better happened: 15 mins later, at 4:20ish, we saw her, with a bag of food inside her purse, just... Walk out.  We looked at each other, and said screw this, let's leave and never return. Considering we've had bad experiences at other Red Robin locations, we are boycotting this establishment indefinitely. Bad service, small, well done burgers, lack of fries and water simply do not make a good visit. I'd get better service from myself at home. She didn't deserve the tip we gave her and she spoiled the rest of our Saturday.

The server was nice and polite but that's all that was good about the trip. My girlfriend and I both ordered water. The cups were dirty and still had sticky, sugary residue on the inside of the cup that would fall into our water if we wiped it. We had ordered a royal robin burger cut in half to share and bottomless garlic fries. The cook brought our burger out but it was not cut in half and he just gave us an extra plate. That wasn't a big deal to us so we just cut the burger in half ourselves. When I tried to place the half of the burger on the other plate, it had cheese on the plate and was dirty. Then the cook brought us regular fries instead of the garlic ones we ordered. I told him and he went ahead and brought us our fries. The whole time our server was missing for ten minutes. We had to push the ""call server"" button on the ziosk to get her attention. I told her about the water and how dirty they were and she was polite and brought us new ones which were still dirty! Then we asked for more fries and she brought us regular fries again. We just accepted it and said we were never coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands?start=200,3.12,3.21,3.21,2.6280000000000006,3.174
42,Anthony A.,"Colton, CA",143,217,88.0,3.0,2016-02-22,"I hadn't been to Red Robin in years, but for some reason I had a craving for the ""bottomless"" steak fries and a burger. Wifey wasn't going to argue, she is always down for a burger. The kids will eat anywhere that there are games to play at the table, so we braved that parking lot lot full of morons (Citrus Plaza and Lugonia right in front of it), and made our way inside. After a few minutes waiting in the lobby area, we were helped by a Hostess and seated almost immediately. Just on time too, because a grip of people walked in at that point. When she seated us, we asked if we could get an extra tablet/kiosk deal for the kids (2) so that they could both play games at the same time without fighting over it. She told us no, that each table was limited to just one. I could understand if we brought an entire Legion of children in, but we were only asking for one more. Every other restaurant we have ever requested this from has happily given us an extra one. That was mildly annoying.  We sat down and our server immediately came to our table and introduced himself. Real friendly Dude, sort of looked like a clean-cut ""Shaggy"" from ""Scooby-Doo"". But in a good way. Very welcoming and attentive, he never once allowed a drink on our table to go empty. A real credit to the staff. We ordered for the kids first, because they tend to take for....ev....er to eat their food. We got them an order of Cluck-A-Doodles and fries to share, as they didn't seem as hungry as me and the Mrs were. Couple of Lemonades for both of them.The chicken strips were standard fare, nothing you couldn't buy frozen and make at home. This is usually the case at most chain restaurants, so we don't hold it against Red Robin. The kids ate most of them, and all the fries so mission accomplished on that front.  We discovered that the Root Beer Floats and Strawberry Lemonades are bottomless now, so my Wife got the Lemonade, and I couldn't resist the Root Beer Floats. Her Lemonade came out looking very appealing in a fancy glass. It was good stuff, very refreshing. My first Root Beer float came out looking extra nice, but every time I got a refill, it started to look like they put less and less effort into it, to the point where the last one looked like a murky broth sort of like a pint of Guiness dumped into a glass, with WAY too much foam in it. Whatever, it was still good. I ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double, medium rare. It was alright, not bad. It wasn't very spicy, and the bun was rendered into paste before I was finished. Kind of like when your Mom made Hamburgers with bread sliced instead buns when you were a kid. But I did enjoy it overall, I just wasn't amazed or anything. My Wife got a Tavern Double, cooked medium. She liked it enough to eat it all, but then again, she is pregnant with twins. She did mention that it hit the spot, so we will chalk this burger up as a victory. The steak fries have always been a factor in my coming to Red Robin. They used to be SO bomb; crispy and golden on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside. But then they went ""bottomless"" years ago, and it seems like the quality has suffered. They are just standard now, not really good enough to make you need them to be bottomless.  We have been coming to Red Robin for years, but they used to be better. Just like most chain restaurants, the quality starts to wane. But this location usually provides us with a good dining experience. We will come back someday.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands?start=60,3.04,3.22,3.22,2.9560000000000004,3.1480000000000006

After all this she finally returned and I asked for the fries she asked if I wanted more and I said yes I did! My sister finally was able to order something else even though we all were almost done eating but she was hungry so decided to order knowing how long everything else took !! Why are they called bottomless fries when getting a refill is almost impossible! Finally when the fries and my sisters burger came yes the fries took that long they were raw every time she would drop something off there was no how is everything or is that tasting better or do you want more refills!

We asked a male server if we course sit at a booth and he knotted it was ok. We sat for about 5 minutes which was ok in its self but a waitress was serving another table that came in after us and my husband asked if we were invisible over here. Sort of making a joke. The waitress said that we were not aloud to sit there and that we needed to be seated by a hostess. After explaining that we were not told that. Pretty much in a nut shell I was so embarrassed by the whole seen I left in tears. Good job on customer service.

They have offered us a $100 gift card, funny, I drop $200.00 per week at Sushi, leave a $60.00 tip, $100 is not worth the pain my wife will go though to walk in that place again while that waitress still works there! So this is not about free food, This is about how a person in the Hospitality Field treated a customer with such disrespect and contempt that they made one of the parties so upset that they went home and got ill!!  She laughed at us, she called us a name and said Buh Bye (like Felicia) to us with her back turned to us as she walked away and mocked us.  All because we accidentally sat ourselves at the Bar without a Hostess.  We did not realize that on this day, at this bar, anything was different from every restaurant bar (even this one) we have ever gone to. If you read the other reviews here you will see that several say "" We go straight to the bar area to eat to avoid the wait"", but when we did it this a waitress treated us like homeless filth. And she was going to ignore us for seating ourselves until a got her attention then she punished us and embarrassed us so bad that we wanted to crawl in a hole...  Anyway, Free stuff will not make me come back...  Only the termination of this woman will be acceptable by me.  If you patronized my business and you were treated like this by one of my employees I would fire them the same day!!  No second chance, no pass!!  She should not get one either!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands?start=160,3.08,3.04,3.04,2.8840000000000003,3.0560000000000005

The young woman who was ready to seat the other patron coldly asked me ""How many?"" and I replied three. She looked irritated and didn't say another word, but instead joined the two other young ladies (who hadn't acknowledged or even smiled at us) behind the front desk. All who had their backs turned and talking softly amongst themselves. After a little time of waiting, I decided that that level of disrespect and poor customer service was not worthy of my patronage. So instead I took the little ones to a busy Denny's (not a favorite restaurant) where I was greeted by not only the lady behind the front desk, but by a server nearby.

The service has been great and the food has always been as expected as far as Red Robin's standards go. It's a pretty busy restaurant so try to avoid dinner on the weekends! Just as a general rule of thumb, I always ask for fries right after we order--that way we have something to munch on while waiting for the food. To be frank, and I still don't understand why, a lot of waiters seem to get annoyed by me asking for fries before our food. This has been my experience at a number of Red Robin chains, but this is the only one where they seem completely fine by it. That said, don't forget to order a bunch of their different sauces to go with the fries--especially the campfire sauce!

The hostess stated our wait would be 20 to 30 minutes. At 6:15 I went up to ask how much longer it would be. The hostess stated that there was one other family in front of us and they were already going to be seated, so we should be next. As we sat and waited another 15 minutes we witnessed 2 other parties get seated in front of us. I went back up to ask why we have not been seated. She then looked to the manager and said let me have him take care of it right away. She then turned back to me and said she thought we were already seated. The manager came back and unapologetically said that we would need to wait another 15 to 20 minutes before we could be seated. Upset I turned to my family and said lets just go. As we walked out I turned to go back in and witnessed the hostess laughing saying ""oh well"", I asked to speak to the manager and he was standing next to her. I told him that I was very disappointed, and that I would ensure I notified someone of their lack of professionalism and empathy. The manager did not seem to care nor did the hostess. My family and I eat at Red Robin 2 or 3 times a month, typically in Rancho Cucamonga, this was our first poor experience. I always believed Red Robin set a high standard for quality food and service, but I guess when you have the wrong people representing your company that can easily change your perspective. I truly hope these two individuals are retrained in how to properly provide they quality service your establishment is known for. I also hope your revisit your choice for manager because it seemed as though he completely lacked the fundamental understanding for customer service.

FRIES - they offer sweet potato fries, regular fries, and garlic fries at an extra cost. the fries are a hit or miss.. but it's ok. they're bottomless.  * their sweet potato fries are good with spicy ketchup.  service and food is better here compared to the red robin in tyler mall, riverside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands,3.2,3.41,3.41,,3.326

'  he knew what he did was unprofessional and unacceptable and i will not be returning after this derogatory behavior.

10,LeeCee B.,"Yucaipa, CA",29,20,4.0,5.0,2017-11-18,"Joseph took great care of us last night. The wait wasn't too bad, the food was amazing. I live the variety on the kids menu. I ordered my toddlers mini corndogs w/ broccoli & meatballs w/ corn & our server suggested cheese sauce for dipping. It was all fresh & hot & so much better than the usual chicken, mac & cheese or cheap burger at most places. My babies devoured their plates. I got the Fiery Ghost (I think) tavern burger. It was so good! It was super spicy, everything was fresh. Considering how busy they were, everything arrived quickly & we were checked on frequently. This was only my 4th trip to a Red Robin (2nd at this location) and I'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands,3.28,3.39,3.39,,3.346

0,Paul J.,"Yuma, AZ",75,528,1401.0,4.0,2017-12-06,It's busy all the time. In my two trips I've had ok food. Both times the sweet potato and regular fries came out kinda warm till the refill. My fancy aoli burger was not that hot and the previous chicken sandwich was juicy but sat under a heat lamp.  My two servers have been opposites; one was a rock star the other I had to ask for everything. I'm still going with 4 stars.  Bathrooms are clean and the over place is clean.

The beef was made well done like I asked and the tower of onion rings were nice and crispy, just the way it should be. Our waiter, Hugo, was very attentive, service was fast, and the food came out quickly. I wish I could put out a longer review and critique on something at least, but I don't think that's necessary since everything was on point.

1,Barbi D.,"Yucaipa, CA",52,10,,2.0,2017-12-23,"December 22, 2017, long day, had my husband picked up a couple of BUNLESS Shroom burgers, preordered, online, paid, pickup time 5:15p. [WE ARE CARB SENSITIVE PEOPLE SO NO WHEAT OR SUGAR IN OUR DIETS] from the Redlands location, we appreciate this menu substitution offer. He arrives, food isn't ready...Hostess is pretty much vacant in the head.  It was busy.  Couldn't find the order.  When the order does arrive, the hostess hands him a cup of fries along with the order...um what?  Food finally comes out at 5:35p.  Item was supposed to be Lettuce Wrap.  The container did state Mushroom Lettuce Wrap. Management in this location needs a serious revamp. At home: We open the containers.  The food is a mess...it basically was a burger patty with cheese and mushrooms with lettuce/salad strewn all over the place.  I wish I had taken a photo, however, hunger prevailed at this point. The burger was awful, we had to salt the food several times...I'm not sure what is going on with Red Robin, however this isn't an isolated incident, we had a similar experience when visiting in WA a couple of years back. I guess you can say they are consistent with poor customer service.   We will seriously reconsider ever returning, the Habit and Five Guys are my burgers joints from this point on.  Wow, just Wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands,3.4,3.41,3.41,,3.406

5,Brian M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,42,,5.0,2018-01-02,"Food was great. I enjoyed a black and bleu burger while my wife ate the smoke n pepper burger. Garlic fries were also the way to go. This review, however, is more about the service we received rather than their food. Simply put, our server gave my wife and I the best service we've received in the 5 years we've been together. My wife and I frequent many restaurants and Kaitlynn (our server) was exceptional and second to none in terms of comparing her to any other sever we've had at any other restaurant we've been to. She was friendly, checked in on us enough, was very prompt, and was always around.  I'm not sure what else to say. Thank you Kaitlynn for making our dining experience great! Being an awesome server takes effort and you did everything right today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands,3.28,3.38,3.38,,3.3400000000000003
4,Erica G.,"Colton, CA",53,24,2.0,1.0,2018-01-13,I don't know why I continue to come to this stupid Red Robin. It never failed something always happens here. Me and my husband don't have date night very often being that we have town little one.  And I ordered a crispy sandwich and it was raw in the inside. So I told Sky the server and she rock it back. Tell me why it took 20 mins to get my sandwich which I told them to cancel because we had movie tickets. So all Skye said was we took you sandwich off the bill and gave you a discount. No I'm sorry nothing. Skye was not a nice server at all. This Red Robin Gourmet Burgers is not good at all. Thank you for ruining my date night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redlands,3.12,3.37,3.37,,3.27
