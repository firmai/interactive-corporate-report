381,Frank R.,"Imperial Beach, CA",67,104,8.0,2.0,2012-01-03,This is a chain restaurant and it is just OK. The food is good and the beer selection is okay. There is nothing about this place that is special.

288,Liz K.,"San Diego, CA",78,347,93.0,4.0,2012-02-11,First time to BJ's and I can't wait to come back.  It reminded me of Seau's in Mission Valley.  They brew their own beer too which was awesome. I had the Nutty Brewnette and fell in love.  Can't wait to go back and try their other offerings. We tried their flatbread pizzas which were nice and thin crust and heavy on the toppings!  So delicious.  Also tried theCreole Tilapia was so good too.   Was too full to try their famous Pizookie but I will be back for more beer and bites!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=280,3.6,3.17,3.17,2.7359999999999998,3.342
451,Ed M.,"San Diego, CA",334,979,841.0,2.0,2012-02-13,"Where to begin.  My trip here started off nice enough.  Went to the bar, got a drink, and waited a bit for some friends to show.  Wait was about 30 minutes.  The hostess was nice and let me know in a timely manner when the table would clear out.  Everything after that...well...let's see.  Appetizers took about another half hour to show up...the food took another half hour to forty five minutes to come out.  By that time I was pretty annoyed as I was ready to eat.  There was a decent crowd but seriously...not enough to warrant that kind of waiting for food.  I ordered a chicken fettucine dish.  When it finally came out it was the blandest pasta I've ever eaten...EVER.  The only taste to it was the burnt chicken pieces that came with the pasta.  I never came close to finishing that dish.  The only highlights were that the beer was fresh (I got a hef) and the dessert a friend ordered was good...the pizzookie which is a giant pizza sized cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  We had two servers through out the night as our original server left for her break. The second server copped an attitude when we informed her we wanted separate checks and said ""You should've told me before I got the final check for your table.""  We informed her we told the first server that and she said she never got that message.  Wow.  Slow ass service with an attitude to boot.  Too bad I'm most likely never coming back here.  That rude server at the end pretty much killed any points this restaurant had left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=460,3.6,3.16,3.16,2.472,3.3360000000000007
510,Mark O.,"Valley View, TX",7,11,,2.0,2012-02-23,"Service was bad.  Took too long for our food to come out.  The Sweet Pig pizza was good, but the Avocado Eggrolls were different here than the BJ's in Dallas.  They were spicy and I tasted no pinenuts.

Anyways, service was great!  He always came back asking if we needed anything.  He brought all the condiments out in a timely matter and was overall a nice funny person. I gave it a 3 because our food was just okay. We had the pizza with artichoke and spinach. It was really dry and hard to eat.  The fish and chips were just okay too.

My friend decided to co-host his birthday dinner here for a group of twenty people. He had made reservations for 7:30 PM. My bf and I arrived 15 mins late, assuming we would simply join our friends at the table. Instead, we found the group split- each half clustered around each end of the bar. There wasn't very much room and we were in the waiters' way. We were constantly dodging waiters who were trying to ring up their tables at the register in the corner just behind us. So we wait for the table to clear up ""in ten minutes"". Ten minutes later, we waited for it to clear in ""fifteen minutes"". It was getting really warm in the restaurant- it definitely needed some ventilation. Just over an hour after the reservation, the group was finally seated. The only pro to the night was three drinks and one beer later, our bill was only $20 at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=320,3.44,3.17,3.17,2.3440000000000003,3.278

243,Mary Ann C.,"San Diego, CA",453,260,1776.0,4.0,2012-06-14,"Hm..  Come to think of it, I have never actually chosen to come eat here.  It's always been at the request of whomever I'm hanging out with.   Definitely a step above any 2 for $20 establishments.  BJ's offers a casual ambiance and a great affordable variety of appetizers, entrees and desserts. I have had a few dishes here and haven't been disappointed yet.  Great place to hang out and have a few drinks and watch some sports (not sure about fights or UFC), or an intimate celebration.   Customer service isn't the best that's for sure.  But with that being said, isn't the worst either. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=240,3.12,3.17,3.17,2.7039999999999997,3.15
346,Robert B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,2.0,2012-06-16,"Went to BJ's the other evening with my wife and youngest daughter.  It wasn't my first choice.  I had been there some time ago and wasn't particularly impressed with the place but my daughter wanted to go, so I gave in.  The menu is pretty extensive, so I figured I'd find something good. The best thing about BJ's (in my opinion) is their extensive selection of beers.  If you are a beer drinker, then you will surely find something tasty here.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the food. The waiter showed up quickly and took our order.  I don't know what's going on, whether there is a new trend in the food service industry or what but servers used to write down the orders.  Its really impressive when someone can actually remember all of the stuff that we order without writing it down, but not so cool when they don't.  Our waiter wasn't as cool as he thought he was. I ordered a medium gourmet five meat deep dish pizza.  The picture looked delicious, and I'm a sucker for deep dish pizza.  I really wanted to love this pizza, but what I actually got did not even come close to meeting my expectations.  It was deep dish all right, about 2 inches thick.  There was also plenty of meat, and the meat tasted pretty good.  My problem was that there was very little else between the meat and bread.  There was a little bit of cheese, but not even close the bubbling pile of deliciousness that BJ's depicts in their photo.  And sauce?  Apparently BJ's don't need no stinkin' sauce.  What I got (for 20 bucks mind you) was basically a piece of bread with meat sprinkled around on top.  Very dry and not at all satisfying. My wedge salad was good, but let's face it - it's hard to mess up a quarter head of lettuce with dressing on top of it.  My wife enjoyed her tomato and whatever salad too.  The hot wings were pretty decent too, once the order was sorted out and we actually got them.  We also ordered some sort of fried artichoke thing that never did arrive... Some of the food arriving at other tables looked pretty good.  My pizza sucked.  Its a good thing I didn't order the large.  Should have skipped the pizza and just drank beer...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=340,3.0,3.16,3.16,2.44,3.0960000000000005

330,Sarah W.,"San Diego, CA",29,87,19.0,5.0,2012-07-10,"On July 3rd I made a last minute reservation for my husband's birthday, in all there were 30 of us. I had been to a BJ's before and the service and food and service wasn't the greatest so I wasn't too excited to return, however it was my husband who chose BJ""s. The menu was extensive and diverse, I liked the option of ordering from the small plates menu as well as the gluten free pizzas. I tried the mozzerella salad and the the watermelon feta, both were very fresh and refreshing, I also ordered the mushroom pizza with carmelized onions on flat bread, again, delicious. Kudos to the manager who was gracious enough to extend happy hour to us at out table, instead of having us go back and forth to the bar to enjoy the HH menu. SERVICE  FIVE stars for ""D"" (Deshon?). D was our only server for 30 of us, I assume because of the last minute reservation. I must say he had such a great attitude, we were a rowdy group, pretty needy, and he was gracious, clam and accommodating throughout the evening and you could tell he was genuine,he was even nice enough to give us separate checks. Everyone commented that he did an amazing job, other severs also came around and made sure everything was ok, they also were very friendly and even chatted with us a bit.

375,Luther V.,"San Diego, CA",38,25,6.0,2.0,2012-08-07,"Came here with my family for my uncle's bday and did not have the best experience. I walked in to a not so friendly host that did not greet us when we walked in.  This is a much larger Bj's restaurant than the one in La Jolla, which is the one I'd prefer to go to if I ever go back to another Bj's.  I ended up ordering the Texas style country fried steak.  It was TERRIBLE!  The meat was dry and the gravy was way too salty.  I ended up just eating the mashed potatoes, without the gravy, and the veggies.  I didn't get to taste anyone elses, but from sauce on my nephew's face it seemed that the ribs weren't too shabby.  I think the best dishes were the Apps. The service was pretty bad.  Our waitress seemed to be pretty flustered when taking our orders and probably smiled 2 times.  When it came time to bring our food, they brought out 2-3 dishes that we didn't order, which one of the dishes was charged on our bill! Overall, if you want to eat at Bj's go to the one in La Jolla.  If you come to the one in Chula Vista, you're going to have a bad time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=360,2.92,3.16,3.16,2.568,3.0640000000000005

When we finally sat down, it took a bit to get drink orders taken.  We had also asked about the 2 for $20 deal and the waitress told us it wasn't happening then.  We asked if she could check on it which she did and yes, it was going.  We finally ordered and the salad was just eh but the tortilla soup my husband got was AMAZING!!!  The pizza was alright.  I think when the person brought it to us they must have held it at an angle cause most the cheese had slid to one side.  The Oreo Pizookie was AWESOME!!   If we go back, I am definitely getting the Tortilla Soup.  Thats IF we go back though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=480,2.88,3.18,3.18,2.636,3.0600000000000005
501,Desi N.,"San Diego, CA",64,351,10.0,4.0,2012-08-13,"My first trip to B.Js was long over due! I was almost convinced that it was another simple franchise like AppleBees or T.J.I Friday serving bland food for low prices. When I came in, I was quite impressed at how nice and clean the restaurant was. It reminded me of being in a replica of a more updated Cheesecake Factory minus the wide selection of Cheesecake and the optional outdoor seating area. The employees were all busy and kept up well with hosting and serving everyone which really made my lunch more enjoyable! I had an awesome server whose name I did not get but everytime I drank my water down to the ice, he was right next to me filling my glass up. I never once needed to call for him or go through numerous failed attempts to get his attention. He was right where I could see him and frequently asked was everything fine. It sure was - from the seating, the atmosphere, the service, to the great company and delicious food! Restaurants' wide ranged menus always make ordering difficult for me but not at B.Js. I did not waste much time trying to figure out what I wanted because nothing stood out more to me than the Salads and the under 450 calories menu. Eating healthy has become a trend and it's definitely one I can't complain about! Right away I knew I wanted the Ahi Seared Salad. I had no idea what to expect but my judgment was on point for once! My taste buds and I were extremely satisfied after lunch here! The salad looked like something from a well known and appreciated recipe book. There's nothing I enjoy more than detail and almost perfect decor on my plate. The chef must have been in a great mood. I was content that I was served very fresh leafy greens as opposed to the usual non nutritional valued iceberg lettce. The avocado balanced well with the freshness of the greens, sauce and the lightly seared ahi. I enjoyed it to the last bite and remember thinking how I couldn't wait for my next lunch at B.Js. What took me so long to try it out? I have no idea. It's now my new favorite lunch spot until I'm proven otherwise. The drinks mounted on the walls made me want to stay for a Happy Hour but I'm not much of a drinker and wouldn't want to be tipsy in the mall. By the way, I recall saying outloud to my friend who ordered delicious avocado rolls how the music choice was great! Two of my favorite songs played back to back. Billy Idol - ""Rebel Yell, and Red Hot Chili Pepper's ""Give It Away Now"" ... Who doesn't like those two songs??? Experience was excellent! Reason for 4 stars is because it's not exactly a 5 star restaurant but very close in my opinion!

I love their French toast.  -Huge dining area and the layout works really well and is very inviting. Cons: -Though they seem to have a lot of employees walking around, when it gets busy the wait at the table for someone to come over can be lengthy at times.  -During football or happy hour it is difficult to find someone to clear a dirty table in the bar section.  -When the restaurant gets busier, the quality of the food seems to suffer.

I never got a refill and we sat there for about 2 whole hours. By the time our food got there we had been waiting about 40 minutes. At one point my brother ordered a second drink and the server took 20 minutes again to bring that one, and we happened to see him across the room with the drink and he stopped to chat up with another server and give her change for her tip money, that was the longest 5 minutes ever being that he was thirsty and had already waited 20 minutes for his drink. His priorities were way off!! We asked for a pazooki being it was my dads birthday....never got it! we asked for our check about 3 different times before we got fed up of waiting and just went to the front counter and demanded the check. When our server had a hard time getting the check the manager was hardly any help and kept leaving, instead of staying to make sure everything was done correctly. He made a couple mistakes untill finally a different waitress came and rang us up. Knowing that we were upset, the manager did nothing to try and make our experience less terrible.

The 3 star night it was a little crowded and my sampler platter tasted like maybe it was gasp...all frozen foods. I'm not sure if it is frozen food but it was just mediocre.

447,Jeannette C.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,13,1.0,1.0,2013-05-29,"I generally ALWAYS tip. Even if the service is horrible, I'll at least round out to the nearest whole dollar. However if the service is great I usually tip over 20% This Sunday, May 26th, 2013, I took my little cousin and nephew to BJ's for some ice cream after the movies at the Chula Vista Mall. Personally I dislike this BJ's because they always have TERRIBLE service. Of the 4 times I've been there I think I only had good service once. Still I went in with an open mind cuz we weren't ""hungry"" and it was the closest place to go for some ice cream and I figured 3 desserts wouldn't take long... After sitting there for 7 minutes without a greeting (yes I kept track of the time from the minute we were seated! This ain't my first time at the rodeo. I know their service sucks, I wanted to compare THIS trip to others I've had there) a server who was walking past and noticed the ANNOYED look on my face greeted us and said he'd find our server. I let him know we were just there for dessert and HE graciously took our order (I wish I'd gotten his name so I could at least put ONE positive thing on here!) Another 5 minutes passed before our server appeared and brought us out the water I'd asked for. She then said she'd put in our dessert order and it would be out shortly. So here is the point where I need to clarify a few things.... Number one, the section we were seated in was clearly marked because I saw the server who took our order bouncing between his tables and not crossing the imaginary line until he greeted us. The table behind us was leaving and the only other seated table in our section was already eating. So unless our server was also cooking in the kitchen, our section didn't appear busy, so I have no idea where the heck OUR server was or what on earth she was doing! Number two, I was a server many moons ago. I ordered a warm dessert so it might have needed to be heated up for a few minutes. But the kids literally had 2 scoops of ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. So from having done it myself in the past I persoanlly know that desserts do not take long to prepare. Which brings me to 25 minutes after we were sat and our server said she'd put in the order for our desserts, they were brought out. The kids loved theirs and mine was disgusting. $6.50 for a bunch of warm berries in a tin with ice cream melting on top of it. I literally had to get up to go look at a menu because I SWORE the description of my dessert included some sort of ""crumble"" in with the berries. Plus I'd had that dessert before. There is usually more to it than just warm berries! At that point I just wanted to leave and not touch anything and not pay but the kids were excited about their sundaes. So I made the decision that I just wouldn't tip. A decision I never make lightly because as I said, I was a server before and remember what that feels like. Since I've been screwed over before where a disgruntled, horrible server over charged my card, I distinctly WROTE out the word ZERO where it says tip on the receipt to avoid any confusion or over charge to my card. This morning, I checked my bank statement and SURE ENOUGH where I had only authorized BJ's to charge $9.45 to my card, they decided it would be ok to round up to $10. I know that's only a 55 cent difference, but I don't care. I didn't authorize that charge and am APPALLED that they had the audacity to feel they can charge me whatever they want even though I SPECIFICALLY signed a statement saying I would authorize a lesser charge. So not only will I be calling my bank and filing complaint of a FRAUDULENT charge to my card. I am going to personally walk in to BJ's this afternoon and speak to the manager in the hopes that at the very least our server ""Jessica"" will be reprimanded for her theft, if not Fired!  I can't believe someone would jeopardize their job over 55 cents!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=460,3.0,3.15,3.15,1.8600000000000003,3.09

Our server was, Corina. She struggled with a thick accent, but that was the least of her pitfalls. When our order started to arrive on the table she was MIA,  for 20 minutes thereafter, MIA. When the food arrived by unpleasant food runners, our meals were shlepped in front of us. Side dishes almost sliding off our plates- Such a turn off.    Finally, a manager came over and settled our outstanding requests for missing meals, steak sauce, and drink refills. He was very helpful. But when our dinner had been sitting 20 minutes already, it was too little, too late. I was really embarrassed.  Thankfully, my family just laughed it off and didn't make a public scene.

One thing I was craving for going to eat at BJs, a deep dish cheeseburger pizza.  Mind you, this was at 7pm on a Sunday evening.  The first blow was that they tell us that they ran out of deep dish pizza!!!  Umm... really, you ran out of something that you are quite known for.  So they try to make us feel better by telling us that they will give us 2 large regular pizzas since we ordered a large deep dish that was half and half.  Fine, it felt like a good enough compensation but that was STRIKE TWO! Then came the shift change.  I am never a fan of shift change.  Service would always drop 50% during a shift change.  No strike here, just dislike that one fact. So when it came time for dessert, another thing that we were craving for.  We ordered a pizookie that was split half and half chocolate chip cookie and their new flavor oreo.  Well, guess what, the ""temporary"" server came back after about 5 minutes to tell us that they ran out of chocolate chip cookie.  Are you serious... was the look on our faces when our ""temporary"" server told us.  What can we do, we went with another flavor.  Red Velvet cookie.  STRIKE THREE!  They should be out by now, but wait..... So here is the icing on top of the already Three Strike cake.  I don't know, but in every restaurant that I've pretty much been to, when you order dessert, its a given assumption that everyone in the Table would share.  Well our table had 5 people but we got 4 spoons.  So we waved our server to ask for another spoon.  Would you believe that his response to us was ""we ran out of small spoons and they had to put a load in the wash"".  So we looked at the spoons that he gave us, 2 small dessert spoons and 2 soup spoons.  Did they go to San Diego zoo to borrow the monkeys that's running / managing this location???

He apologized profusely so I didn't give it a second thought at the time.  We moved over two tables because a couple had just departed from the table next to us and it hadn't been cleaned off yet.  After the staff cleaned up the mess that the drink made, they left the wet towels along with the dishes of the departed guest on that table the entire time we were there eating. My wife had the Cajun chicken pasta and I had the chili stuffed potato.  The food was good, but again here we are looking at the wet towels and dirty dishes while we are eating. When the check came, I was amazed that they didn't give us a discount for the problems we had to deal with.  The result of all of it was a $0.00 tip.  We won't be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=260,2.44,2.78,2.78,1.988,2.644

After that, it was just all downhill.  I'll never come to this place again and I'll make sure to tell all my friends and family not to.

The pizza was luke warm, the crust was still doughy, and the chicken tasted as if it were over cooked in a microwave. I've had frozen meals better than that.  My mother had the new lobster tacos. Somehow they managed to miss the mark with that as well. The lobster tasted rubbery, among the lack of fresh ingredients on the taco, the store bought flour tortillas, and the runny ""guacamole."" She said it was bland and salty. She would have rather had tacos at Rubio's for a third of the price and made correctly. I used to like going to BJ's, but it seems they have really gone downhill.

Our second trip to BJ's praying that it would be a better experience then the first, was if not way worst then the first visit this time we sit in the booths by the bar for happy hour we order chips and salsa and wings as an appetizer and for entrees I order a caesar salad and a tortilla soup, and my girl friend orders Sliders. 35 minutes go by still no appetizer, I mean come on how hard is it to bring chips and salsa out?? Now 40 mins go by I finally tell the waiter and he says oh yeah I forgot  finally after 45 mins have gone by we get the appetizer and the entrees all at once.

I have only tried their deep dish pizzas, but my husband had their top sirloin as well. The deep dish pizzas are DIVINE; that's the truth! On the other hand, their prices and the attitudes of the waitresses are the exact opposite. THE GOOD: Yes, the deep dish pizzas are to die for. They are baked to perfection with large amounts of toppings and the crust gets to the perfect crispy goodness. THE BAD: Expect to pay $14 for a personal pizza and upwards of $20+ for a small, mediocre piece of steak. THE OTHER BAD: The service and attitudes of the waitresses were crummy both times that I've been here. I understand that you're busy and don't really care about me, but if I ask you what's your favorite dish between my two picks or I ask you how your day has been going, please don't roll your eyes or huff and puff because I'm asking your opinion or just making small talk. I also understand that people have off days and some days just plain suck, but until the person who waits us is not in a standoff mood, I'm leaving my review as three stars. Chances are, I'll continue to come back to BJ's regardless of the wait staff and the price... Those deep dish pizzas are worth it. **TIP: Last time we came in, they offered us a rewards card. Kind of like Red Robin's reward program, each dollar you spend at BJ's you earn 1 point. They culminate until you have a certain amount and you can get a % off your ticket, free dessert, etc, etc, etc. Worth it if you go here more than two times probably. **",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=220,2.88,2.64,2.64,2.444,2.736

We love to come to this BJS location because of the great staff, service and food, but were severely disappointed during this visit. We waited about 10 minutes to have our drink order taken, and about 30 more to receive our food. We ordered a couple of appetizers along with an entree and expected to have the items brought out in waves like they usually are, but that wasn't the case. After waiting for minutes without the waters we had ordered we were ambushed with every single thing we had ordered, with some of the items being cold. When the food was brought out, we did not have napkins, utensils or plates and were left stranded with no way to eat our food for an additional 10 minutes. Several waiters walked by and say they would bring utensils and plates but never did.

I could easily forgive them if it was during the lunch or dinner rush but it was 2pm and there were servers and empty tables everywhere. Still, the service was ridiculously slow and my actual server was not very friendly. He never smiled...not once! Also puzzling to me is why he would serve my 2-year old daughter orange juice in a lowball glass??? Seriously? How odd and thoughtless is that? I had to taste the damn thing just to make sure it wasn't a screwdriver or something. Not to mention the fact that she's not exactly nimble enough to hold a heavy glass like that all by herself. So every time she tried to drink her juice, I had to drop everything and hold it steady for her. Geez! Also, we didn't even get any utensils. I had to ask for them AFTER our food came out. As for our food, my salad came out with no dressing. Really? At least put it on the side if you're not going to add it to the salad before serving it. I can only assume that perhaps something was going on in the kitchen that led to the slow service or maybe our server was just new. Either way, I know we weren't the only ones being affected. I spent so much of my meal time sitting and waiting that I observed other tables around me getting apologies about the wait from their own servers, as well as a man who I can only assume was the manager on duty. For that, I didn't withhold leaving my server my normal 25% tip for our meal because I'm sure he was doing his best (or at least I hoped he was).

I ordered a chicken alfredo pasta plate and also felt that the pasta was very bland hand had no taste. I've had sandwiches and burgers from here before, and have always felt satisfied. For some reason their main dishes seem to fall flat. The reason this recent visit was so disappointing was because the drinks and appetizers we had ordered were amazing!

Service was outstanding, our waiter was great about offering the lunch specials and really catered to keeping our ice tea's full. I went with my usual lunch special of the chicken tacos with a side of black beans. You really can't beat the price of $5.95 for a good sized lunch. My coworker ordered the ham sandwich lunch special, but also wanted to try the Twisted BLT salad on the side which peaked my interest to try one also. The twisted BLT salad was a really good salad which came with spinach, boiled egg, bacon, cheese and bits of corn. Definitely better than getting a plain ole house salad.

This is ridiculous!! A soon as I arrived the person signing us in acted as if she did not want to be there. There was no organization as to who went next. I had a couple tell the hostess that they arrived first and skipped us. Once we were seated about 15 minutes had passed and nobody came to ask for drinks or anything. Then there was a table of people next to us that were asked by a waiter what they wanted and still we did not get acknowledged. The level of service this location was horrid. Had this been a fast food chain, I would not mind but when you have an average ticket of $40-$65 for a couple you would expect a higher sense of urgency from the people serving you.

231,Mollie N.,"Chula Vista, CA",213,77,357.0,1.0,2015-05-28,"I come to this BJ's location fairly frequently, and yesterday's service is the WORST I have received here. Arrived at 2:40 PM.  Light customer load, enough waitstaff and hostesses present. Placed order for a party of 2 in the dining area. Order = stuffed baked potato (potatoes are already baked, only need warmed and toppings put on) and soup with salad.  Very easy order to prepare and serve, wouldn't you agree? Waited 25 minutes for our pre baked potato, pre made soup and lettuce.   Our waitress was more concerned with walking around as slow as a snail, talking with other staff, cashing out previous checks, taking new orders at other tables but only delivering drinks No napkin/silverware delivered, at all.  My friend had to go to the hostess to get it. I saw our waitress watching this happen, but she made no attempt to approach our table.  A DIFFERENT waiter brought out the soup and salad, but no baked potato.   I asked him to please bring it as it was missing from the order, and to place the potato in a carryout container. He agreed and brought it to the table immediately.  Not sure why he could bring that out so quickly in a to-go container versus a plate with the rest of the order so I could eat it, but whatever. Waitress never checked on us, but walked past our table several times. Stopped the waitress and asked for our check.  That was the only thing she brought promptly. My friend asked for another bowl of salad (since it is of course, all-you-can-eat soup and salad).  Waitress agreed but was perturbed. No salad came out.  Ever.  I watched her the entire time from my friend's request for more.  Instead, she did other things. My friend asked for a to-go container.  Though we were within 20 feet of a server's station with to-go containers in the cabinet, our waitress went to other areas of the restaurant (but not other customers, just other areas).  Never to return again...until my friend went to the hostess to ask for a to-go container and the hostess went straight to the server's station near us and gave one to my friend.  ONLY then, did our waitress come out from wherever, but NOT to our table...oh no...but to the hostess stand to loudly complain to the hostess how we were bad customers, wanting too many things. (Ahem..not too much to ask for when we ask for silverware, the missing part of our order, our check, another helping of all-you-can-eat salad and a to-go container.  I didn't know that was beyond what a customer should request?  And we never even asked for our food while waiting 25 minutes...thought we were pretty patient about that.) Still no second helping of salad anywhere to be found.   Our waitress never walked to the kitchen once.  I kept my eyes on her the entire time since my friend's order. So we got up to leave (yes, we paid our promptly-brought bill) and our waitress saw us, and still made no attempt to move toward us from the server station at the back of the restaurant.  But, she DID manage to give us the stink-eye as we were leaving. So gracious of her.

Fortunately, I brought it up to my bartender who was more than happy to bring an extra side of marinara sauce which I was thankful to her for.  Afterward, I ordered the brussels sprouts. It was my first time ordering that dish. It tasted burned. However, I assumed that that was the smoky flavoring mentioned in the description. After a while though I could no longer tolerate the strong taste and I pointed it out to my bartender and I asked her if it was me or was the Brussels sprouts burned? She looked at it and thought it looked burned as well. She tested the aroma and said that it did smell burned. She brought it up to the other bartender who confirmed that it was in fact burned.  Although I was not charged for the dish, I was quite disappointed as I really like brussels sprouts. I really enjoy coming to the bar at this restaurant but this is the first time that the quality of the food was really bad. Perhaps it was because it was late, but overcooked and mushy spaghetti and burned Brussels sprouts on the same day is a bit overboard.

Servers kept walking by, but nobody offered to help us, so I went back to the hostess to ask her instead. She was very nice about it and told me she would send someone over, but nobody came. After standing in the bar for another five minutes or so without being helped, we decided to bus our own table and grab menus from other empty tables. Nobody ever apologized or offered to wipe the table that we ended up bussing ourselves. Once we sat down, everything seemed to happen in slow motion --the service definitely wasn't fast. My strawberry margarita tasted like it didn't have any alcohol in it, but the carnitas fries were SO good. They came in a mini pizza pan with fries on the bottom and all the toppings on top. The only negative experience with the food is that we didn't get silverware. I had to track down my server, and when she finally came with silverware, she only brought one set which didn't make sense because there were clearly three of us.

The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice. It was like a combination of elegant restaurant and sports bar. There were several TVs throughout the restaurant with sports playing. The tables were nice and big and very comfortable. There was plenty of space in between tables and it didn't feel crowded although it was a little busy. It was however a bit dark and I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu.  Oh boy, the menu was intense. There were probably about 20 pages and there was so much to choose from. There wasn't a lot of pictures and the font was very small. I felt a bit overwhelmed on the selections and being an indecisive person it took me a while to finally figure out what I wanted.  We started off with the potato skins appetizer. It was alright. It was lacking several toppings on a few of the skins. Overall it was O.K.  I ordered a sweet tea with lemon and the tea was actually very good. I ordered the Fish N Chips with wedge fries. The fish was nice and crispy and the fries were excellent. They had the perfect flavor and perfect amount of crispiness and softness. My mom enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich.  My mom said the BBQ sauce on her sandwich was nice but was pretty spicy, but she did enjoy it and finished the whole thing. My brother ordered the double decker and he thought it was going to be hot but it was cold but he said he liked it. My family told them it was my birthday and after we got our to-go boxes our server brought me out a small Pizookie with a candle and said Happy Birthday. They didnt do a birthday cheer or song. Thats ok. The pizookie was very doughy. It was tasty but i could only eat one bite!

I got the Tuscan Tomato soup with the Caesar salad, he got the Chicken Tortilla soup with the Tomato Basil salad.  Here's the thing. The place was mostly empty. Our orders weren't particularly complicated. And yet, it took almost twenty minutes for our food to get to us. I was almost beyond my hunger by the time we got our meals.  My soup was okay, though a bit oily. It could have done with a dollop of cream or a smattering of cheese, though. The salad was terrible.

195,Marina O.,"San Diego, CA",33,24,13.0,1.0,2016-02-19,"I just had the the worst service I've experienced here. This had always been our go to place after work for happy hour because they had great prices on appetizers, drafts, and cocktails. That's changed, unfortunately, along with the quality of drinks and service. All I got I was sugary syrup and ice, and charged for items that were never ordered! Also, our waiter didn't really check up on us and at least 20 mins or more would go by between our drink order and delivery. We were here for about five hours! That's ridiculous when we are only a few feet from the bar. I'm very disappointed mostly because my friends and I kind of had an emotional attachment to this place. We've bonded here and have enjoyed really delicious food, but all that's gone down the drain after tonight. I've also been to the BJs at Grossmont Center with my family and the service isn't that much better. What's going on?! Food is delicious, service is ""eh"", and service recovery (when something goes wrong, it needs to be corrected) definitely needs improvement.  Story time: My mom and I came to have lunch here a while ago: There were crayons on the floor in the middle of the walkway and my mom slipped, fell, and hit her head on the floor as we were being walked to our table. She was hurt, so embarrassed and so upset that hostess didn't offer any sort of compensation. I was the one who picked up the crayons off the floor and no other staff or manager came to check up on her. We didn't even place our drink order before my mom walked out of there and she's never been back since.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=180,2.6,2.87,2.668,2.244,2.7620000000000005

Anyway, it was a while ago (and maybe a fluke) so I thought maybe I'd give it another try. Besides, I was meeting a friend in the area and there are few places here with decent happy hour.  We came in ~5pm and it was near empty. The hostess motioned that we could seat ourselves at the designated bar area for happy hour. This was fine as from the door, we could see some booths available. Or so we thought. There were 4-5 of them, but they were all yet to be busted. So awkwardly, we walked about before we seated ourselves at the ""cleanest"" table. They busted it right in front of us.  The waitress then came to get our order. She was ok and on point. She brought out our drinks and food before going on her break and giving us the courtesy of introducing her relief while she was gone.  We ordered 3 appetizers along with our drinks.  The California Club flatbread was good. The calamari was just fair. (But I am a fried squid fiend so naturally, I've had better.) My friend was looking forward to the boneless wings. It was a disappointment, more so because not sure if it was what we ordered. She wanted the spicier sauce. We questioned the waiter on it and not being certain himself decided to bring the sauce plate up to his nose to sniff it. My friend was disgusted by this, and left that sauce to the side under quarantine.   I really wanted dessert, but decided Starbucks, a couple doors down would suffice as a better option. Our bill was not cheap. Our regular waitress returned and my friend opted to let her know about the ""sauce incident"" as we were signing the check, not to complain but to give them the constructive criticism to better their service (so she reasoned). Does it matter anyway? Needless to say, we won't be returning, and will have to continue our search for better happy hour elsewhere.

It was crowded and those waiting at reception were backed up so I seated my self in front of the draft bank at the bar.  I was promptly greeted by Mathew, whom inquired as to my drink preference and offered a menu.  I was directly in front of a Brewhouse Brand tap called Jeremiah Red.  It looked appealing so I asked for it.  Mathew asked if I had ever had it before and my negative response prompted him to pour a good sized taste.  It was like something familiar I had before but couldn't place at that instance.  My comment to the bartender was, ""this is very drinkable."" Almost as quick as I mentioned this my salad appeared, and in a few more brief moments my triple decker sandwich was in front of me.  Both were excellent, and I sipped some, but didn't pay too much attention to my ale.  After the heavy duty chow down was finished, I had time to pay attention to the beer.  It dawned on me that it is nearly identical to one of my favorite pub beers in England.  It was either McCaffery's or Caffery's Irish Cream Ale.  Then I noticed the tap had in small letters Irish style ale.   Food was really good service was quick and friendly price was fair.   As I paid and tipped, I told my new bartender friend that the beer alone will bring me in again whenever I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=100,2.88,2.73,2.672,2.836,2.79

Why did i wait to long!!!??? As we walk in the door we wait for a few minutes and we are greeted by a manager. He was very friendly and his customer service skills were great. He sat us in a big booth which was nice bcuz we all had our personal arm space cuz my son and husband take up all the arm space when it comes to eating.  As we sit we have our server ernest help us out. Omg he was perfect!!! Nice patient and very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu is huge! There are two menus, the regular food menu & drinks. We started with raspberry iced tea for baby girl ( which was a bit strong for her ). Angelito... Apple juice and baes got 2 of theyre in house crafted beers i don't know the names lol i had a white peach margarita& later a strawberry splash margarita. Both were great.!! We had the fried asparagus to start as an appetizers while we drank and the kids shared an off menu spaghetti plate. Which was perfect for them due to my son eats alot & my daughter eats very little lol. Them asparagus tho...wow!! Had a great flavor to them and came with a dipping sauce that i found licking off my fingers when the asparagus were all finished lol. Baes ordered a chili bowl... Was delicious and warm. And a plate with half rack ribs and steak... The ribs were  ! Flavoring was amazing and they came right off the bone! That's what i call perfect cooked ribs fo sho! I had ordered the cheddar broccoli soup inside of a sourdough bread bowl...fffuucckk!! This soup was awesome very thick cheddar taste and the bread wasn't too soft or too hard. It was on the crispy side which was perfect to dip with my soup. I also had the baked zitti i believe. It was great had tons of cheese, sasuage and pepperoni throughout the whole pasta.

Came in with a party of 7 on a Sunday (9/25) around 6:30. Was told it would be about 20-25 minutes to be seated. 45 minutes later and we were still waiting. I asked the hostess at the door how much longer it would take and she tells us another 15-20 minutes. At this point my family was hungry and not willing to wait so I asked to sit at one of the tables that were clearly open. And the hostess gives me THE WORST attitude staying ""well you guys won't fit there but you can try"". I'm a nice person and I've worked service jobs so I've dealt with rude people - so I didn't give attitude back but I made it clear that this was not okay. Dude, at this point we're just trying to eat and go - we could have left and let you guys lose $200 (which is what we spend on average when dining at BJs). They finally get us seated at a table but not without attitude from the hostess and whomever the manager on duty was (he was wearing a blue colored shirt). Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. But our food took close to another hour to come out which I don't understand because at this point, half of the restaurant was empty (it was 8:40 at this point). And to top it off, most of our food was cold. Def not cool. It tasted as if our food sat there for 20 minutes.

We come here a few times a month. We always sit at the bar, have a couple glasses of wine, and order food. Every time we come here the bar tender/servers are awesome! Hence, why we keep coming back. I'm in customer service myself and I am a flight attendant for a reputable airline who is ranked #1 by JD Powers every year in customer service. I'm very big on customer service and making our customers feel welcomed, always have a smile on my face, and I do all I can to make sure they are enjoying themselves.  Today, once we sat at the bar. The bar tender Solimar never said hello to us. When he gave us the menus he was not pleasant, and still no greeting. It was awkward. It took a while for us to get our drinks and there were only 4 others sitting at the bar. He kept walking passed us and never once checked in with us. We finally had to ask him if we could order food... who does that?! We should never have to ask, he should be on top of it. Again, we felt so awkward. The food that was brought out to us was the wrong order and this happened TWICE. We gave up because we never got the right appetizers we ordered. Plus, those wrong items were on our bill. Horrible customer service. He never refilled our cocktails and never asked us how our food was. The other customers at the bar were complaining too. One gentleman only ordered a beer and poor guy waited so long for a refill and he was so frustrated. We did nothing nothing wrong to deserve service like this. Solimar didn't care to make the situation right. We shouldn't have to go out and pay for horrible customer service. We had to ask him for everything and we don't understand why he kept avoiding his customers at the bar. We were in a hurry to leave because this ruined our evening. All we wanted to do was get out of this place. I wanted to write this review in hopes that BJ's management will address this issue. Maybe Solimar was having a bad day but when you come to work, you come prepared and ready to work. I'm pretty easy going and I understand things can get pretty hectic but all the customers at the bar seemed upset. I hope that this issue is addressed.

Me and fellow veterans went on Veteran's day to enjoy a complimentary meal on BJ's thanking us for our service! We went to BJ's over other restaurants hoping to satiate our hunger. Well, BJ's made sure too keep us starving after we waited and waited in our booth for an hour for our sandwiches. We finally tapped out and called it quits after seeing other veterans leave with disappointed faces. Other patrons appeared to be happy with their service. I began to think that maybe just maybe we were not their top priority. I am also gonna mention Kerry, our server, she abandoned us! She did her shift change and failed to do a proper turn-over with incoming server. This experience made us feel unappreciated and really hungry! It was just plain sad how they treated us on our day we were supposed to feel honored for serving and defending our country!

I didn't really like what I ordered though - a deep dish pepperoni pizza. It was just not something that excited my taste buds. However, the clam chowder I ordered was great! A litttle salty but not too shabby. The main pizza dish took a while to come out to be honest. But what stood out to me about this visit was the amazing customer service. My waitress was extremely knowledgeable about what was in the menu, any sides that I had questions about, etc. she was great. With these places it's a hit or miss with the service and my friend and I tipped her well because she did great.

This usually is never my first choice or an option. The food isn't horrible it's just not great either though. Or maybe just isn't something I crave. This time around, we came because we needed somewhere close by the AMC at the Chula Vista mall which is what landed us here. We got seated right away because they offer to reserve a table or check in through their mobile app so we did that prior to arriving here.  Our server started us with our drinks and by the time he brought the drinks back we were ready to place our order.   1) clam chowder in a bread bowl 2) guacamole burger  3) jalapeño burger  4 gluten free flatbread Pizza w pepperoni & jalapeños  A food runner came back with the first 3 items and I thought mine would just be coming out shortly? A few seconds after the runner dropped the food off the server approached our table and said ""were missing something aren't we?"" Hum yeah JUST my food....   (How did he forget my order? It was literally the last thing and we had a conversation about the pizza as well.) Anyway- by the time I got my food everyone was pretty much done eating but that's fine. Cool thing is he gave me a free salad to eat while I wait so at least I still ""was eating with my boyf and his family"" The manager came to the table and offered to remove it off the bill and emphasized and said those pizzas cook fast. Well, I'm sure everyone has their days or maybe the server was having something on his mind but every time he asked if we needed something at that time if we needed, ranch, a refill on our drinks he ALWAYS forgot we literally had to be like ""hey man still waiting on the ____"" at least 3-4 different times.

No waiting time and the service is great as well. However, today I came in with my mom and sister in celebration of my mom's birthday. The restaurant was packed and looked busy. It was a 30-45 minute wait which was fine. However, we noticed that multiple people that came in after us started getting seated before us, so I went to ask when was our turn. Turns out the hostess forgot about us and did not  write my name down for a table... I didn't make a big deal about it because I understand people forget. Also, I felt bad for the hostess because one of the servers was being really rude to her. Demanding her to do her bill? Or do something for her. She was talking down on her. And I think that's not right for a co-worker to try to intimate another co-worker. So, other than that the food was great! There was a wait for the appetizer and food but once again not a big deal for me. It wasn't until there was a 30 minute wait for the dessert? Kind of made me not want it anymore. But I brought up the issue to my server and he offered to speak to the manager. It's not what I wanted of course but he did it anyways. All I wanted was an explanation. But the manager ended up taking off the dessert! Which was really nice of them to do.  To sum it up, I recommend coming during the week between 1-4pm.

We've eaten here several times with great food and great service, but for some reason, on this day, the food was subpar and the service was to blame for that. We were seated and ordered our appetizers shortly after drinks arrived. The appetizers would have been excellent if served on time, but it was evident that they sat under the heat lamp for too long. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were starting the shrivel and the avocados in the egg rolls had browned. While the flavors were mostly there, much of the texture was lost and made the food barely palatable.  Once the entrees arrived after a long wait it was also evident that the same problem occurred with the main course as well; the food had been prepared in a timely manner, but service left it under the lamps too long. The top layer of our food was dry. The vegetables had no vibrancy, the top side of the chicken and the sausage and shrimp were dry.  From a culinary standpoint the marinara in the shrimp and asparagus pene was bland as if no seasoning was used at all and the Cajun Jumbolia was over seasoned.  This isn't usually a problem. Again - we've eaten here many times before. Today was just a bad experience.

We were seated right away and everything was great at first. However, we ordered our drinks and it took quite a while to get those, but we figured that everyone was busy serving others. We ordered our food and were excited. Myself and one of the others in our party ordered a steak -this is where it all went downhill. The steak was still very pink even though both of us ordered medium. Not only that but our mashed potatoes were cold. We still ate, not wanting to cause a scene. However no one checked up on us, even though we told them that we wanted the check plenty of times.  The second time, I went with a group of 6. This time, the food was better, HOWEVER, it took about an hour for them to ask our order, about another hour to get the food, and about another hour to get the check AFTER we asked for the check.

The last two times we've eaten here which was probably within two weeks of eachother. The service was really bad.  First time I was understanding because the waitress told us she was new. (Why they would give a new waitress a party of 11 people is beyond me.) The food seriously took over an hour to come out. I'm not even exaggerating!  The second time which was last night was just as bad. My sister called ahead to put 11 people on the list for a table, the lady said it wasn't that busy so it shouldnt take too long. When my aunt got there they said my sister told them 5. So they changed it to 11 so we had to wait a bit. Then when we sat down. We put our drinks in and it took forever for our waiter to comeback with our drinks and to take our orders. Twice random staff came to our table with food looking like they were lost. Not sure if the food belong to us. Which it didnt. I can't even count how many times someone in our table had to say...""Where's our waiter?"" That was the theme for the night. My sister asked a lady who brought food to the table if she can get a refill and the lady said ""Oh yea, you're waiter will get that for you."" Like damn! That would be fine if we can find that fool. Is touching the drink machine not in your job title? You can't even say I'll get your waiter. COME ON! Then I heard my uncle from the end of the table ask another lady if a packet of sugar was regular sugar and she said I kid you not she said ""I don't know"" and when my uncle said but you work here she says ""I'm just a hostess"". I saw all he was trying to figure out was which one was regular sugar from the white, pink, and yellow packets. So I had to explain it to him myself. I don't know why someone in food service doesn't know that answer. Fyi hostess lady, the white packet is regular.

Our server (sorry...so bad with names) was a very friendly young man. He did seem like he may have been a bit nervous or shy maybe, either way though he was still friendly & pretty quick. There was a couple moments where we wondered where he was as we needed some refills, but we spotted him ""busting his butt"" around the restaurant, so it was not big deal. Not like some places where the servers just stand around talking..etc. Anyway, that's besides the point. We didn't wait unusually long, so it didn't bother us too much. Appetizers came out pretty quick, we got the spinach & artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks. Both so delicious. Wednesday night special was loaded burgers & unlimited fries for $10 so my husband and I opted for one of the loaded burger options. I wanted to get the guacamole one like he got...but sadly the onions in the guacamole mix prevent that. Oh well, my bacon cheeseburger one was still so juicy & tasty. My daughter decided to go with the spaghetti dish, which she seemed to really enjoy. I got my strawberry margarita and my husband got one of the craft brew beers. I was a little bummed to find that this place salts the glass of the strawberry margarita, so it was a little hard to enjoy the taste whenever some of the salt crept up in the straw. Other than than not really liking the margarita as much, no complaints about the food or the service. I'm sure we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=80,2.56,2.76,2.716,2.544,2.68

So thank you BJ's for keeping my wife fun, she goes to BJ's drinks gets home & I get a..... there's a dirty joke there but I'll leave it alone & keep this review PG-13. :)~ First to start with I love the inside & customer service. Very spacious & a lot of TV's so if your a sport guy like me you'll love it! Right when you come in you get greeted & seated as soon as possible, every time we have came we have gotten good customer service & good quality of food at a good amount of time. Never had a issue with customer service. Bartenders are fast & accurate. Like I said my wife is a big fan & it took me awhile but now I'm a fan as well. It took awhile for me to find enough items to want to come & eat. At first I got fish tacos they were ok, wings were also ok, I wouldn't recommend the chips & salsa & I had a couple pasta items that were also ok. At first I couldn't find items I really loved, but now I have. Avocado Egg Rolls, they are ORGASMIC! I blush when I eat them! You have to start with that as a appetizer & a tortilla soup you'll love them both! My kids, wife & me enjoy their big baked potato with grill chicken in it, it's amazing! Ribs are on point! And if you come here you have to get a pizza, my fav Chicken Bacon Ranch! Make sure to get fries their pretty good here. And don't leave until you eat desert I don't care how full you are, get the pizookie you'll thank me later!  Over all I have really grown to like this place & look forward to coming here with the family. I hear the steak is very good & they got great happy hour prices & good specials on their burgers on certain days, gonna have to try it. So thank you BJ's for the good food & customer service & sending my wife home buzzing & happy this husband appreciates it & salute you! Keep up the good work & I'll see you soon! I am a fan of BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista,2.96,2.79,2.804,3.184,2.8579999999999997

Had the appetizer sampler which included mozzarella sticks, buffalo boneless wings (or another choice of sauce), avocado egg rolls, and spinach artichoke dip--good value for the quantity. Ordered a half/half medium pizza (don't remember the names but one was the Hawaiian and the other was the CA Supreme). Plenty of toppings, but lacked sauce. The crust was nice and fluffy. Also ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Came out super fresh, crispy, flavorful; delicious dish overall. And lastly had the churro pizookie--tasted freshly made and good amount of crunch, chewy, and sweetness.  Wanted to give a shoutout to our server, George, who was super friendly, attentive, and obviously a hard worker.

32,Chloe Ysabelle S.,"San Diego, CA",23,14,18.0,1.0,2017-07-15,"The worst BJ's I have EVER been to. This place is a mess. Whoever hired the staff there needs to be fired, asap.  After watching a movie, my friends and I decided to come here to eat dinner. Ladies at the front are completely unprofessional. Always chatting it up, ignoring customers. We got seated after 10 minutes. all was well.  It took 20 minutes for our waiter named Mario to even come by and greet us. He walked past our table SEVERAL times. He asked us what we wanted to drink, and we waited another 15 minutes for our drinks to come. Waited another 15 minutes for him to come back to our table and ask us what we wanted to order. Mind you, he kept passing by our table.  He finally asked us what we were going to eat, and after we said the main entrees, I SAID SPECIFICALLY, ""FOR DESSERT, WE WOULD LIKE THREE PIZOOKIS."" He said ""okay, your order should be coming soon.""  30 minutes later, a pizooki came. BEFORE OUR MEAL. I said politely, "" Sorry but I said this was supposed to come out after we're done eating?"" The lady that brought it to us said, ""Alright let me find out what's going on with your server. You can just keep that."" Our waiter then comes and says, ""You guys ordered the pizooki right? Now you guys are saying you don't want it anymore?"" I said, ""No. I told you specifically that the pizookis were for dessert. It doesn't make any sense for us to eat the dessert before our meal."" The nerve of this guy to then all of a sudden reply with ""well you should've ordered it afterwards, whatever."" My blood was beginning to BOIL at this point.  After another 30 minutes, our food finally came. All except my friend's chicken alfredo. We thought it would arrive 5-6 minutes after we had all gotten our food, but NOPE. It never did!!!!!! I called someone else over and I said, ""You guys have the worst costumer service ever. We've been waiting for about an hour now and we still don't have my friend's food. We're all pretty much done eating. Our waitor was extremely rude and threw a fit about us complaining about the pizooki coming BEFORE our meal. I would like to speak to your manager. ASAP!!!""  Not to mention I also has to ask 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOR HONEY MUSTARD AND RANCH!! THE LAST PERSON FINALLY BROUGHT IT TO ME AFTER I WAS DONE WITH MY SANDWICH!!  The next thing you know, our waiter stands by our table talking to another waiter. He then proceeds to state, and I quote, ""I GOT SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THESE DAMN KIDS OVER HERE."" That's when I completely LOST it. I told the girl that I talked to and asked to bring the manager over to come to our table once more. I told her what he just said and she said that she apologized and that the manager would be coming to our table soon.  The manager came, I told him our dilemma. Gave the whole speech about how sorry he was, etc. And we got a new waiter, as if that was really going to help at all at this point because she was just as shitty as the other one.  Alfredo came, and the pizookis came afterwards. We ended up getting the drinks for free, pizookis for free, and alfredo for free. 40 bucks for 7 people. Lol that was the only good thing that came out from that night. We didn't bother leaving a tip. I don't really care. They treated us like shit, pretty much expecting us to somehow compensate for their actions. Mario, if you're reading this, a big FUCK you. If you hate your job so much, quit! Stop ruining your customer's day just because you've got a stick up your ass. He was also frustrating the other people behind us. Kept messing up their order and everything.  Anyway, never coming back here. Would rate -1000 stars if I could.  Oh, and i'm not exaggerating these time frames.  It literally took us nearly 3 hours to get out of that hell hole because they were so slow.

Aside from our waitress Stephanie and the bartender, the service was horrendous and ridiculously unprofessional. My family came in for lunch around 12:30 and was met by 4-5 employees doing absolutely nothing but having very loud personal conversations at the hostess stand. The ""hostess"" took just enough time to turn to us and point at a table and said "" You can sit up there in that round booth the waiter will get you menus"" im no expert but im pretty sure thats the hostess job to TAKE YOU to your seat and SEAT YOU with menus. NOT TODAY! After we sat ourselves the really important conversations and revolving group of disrespectful annoyingly loud employees using the hostess stand as a hang out continued.

So clearly she wasnt doing her job in that area, As soon as we turned to walk to the table we were directed to the group of employees continued their loud and personal conversation. This went on the entire time we were inside the restaurant,as a hostess you're the face of that restaurant, these faces showed laziness and disconcern  about general the duties as a host. This is a pretty crappy experience just to walk in to. Walking out was the same, while we were sitting we noticed they did the same with other customers, it's really just disappointing,  as we walked out I saw one of the host just sitting at the couch and again they were busy talking to say goodbye.

42,James B.,"San Diego, CA",10,43,9.0,3.0,2017-09-06,"I usually order food to go so this review is based on this. If I call in and the person on the to-go line takes my order it is usually 99.9% correct. Happy days! If you go to the bar and then decide to order food to go, you should call the TO GO person over to take your order. A few times I have sat at the bar and ordered through the bartenders. Sorry guys/girls - not good for you.   1st time the bartender was busy and wrote my order down. Then she never put it in the computer because she got distracted by someone in the service well (yes, I was in the industry  so I give leniency where it is due but come on! ). :( 2nd time the bartender wasn't busy. I gave the bartender my order and I asked, ""Aren't you going to write this down?"". He tapped his finger to the side of his head and smiled, as if he was going to remember my order. Well, I sat there, had a few beers while I waited for my food and made some new friends. The order came, I didn't check it (stupid me as it is all the way across town to get here). I got home and they put chicken in the derby salad, I told him my wife was allergic to chicken and he forgot to order my button mushrooms.  Lesson learned. If you are going to order food to go, do yourself a favor and order from the person at the TO GO station.  On a side note, I have eaten in the restaurant and AT the bar and my order has always been perfect so take this for what it is. A little tip for the tipsy.  I encounter this at a lot of places that I get food to go so it is ultimately up to me to get it right but it would be nice not to have to bother.

Superior service, from offering dessert first, to bringing the appetizers out hot and fast, ahead of our entrees. Appetizers were hot and tasty (we ordered meatballs, and the spinach and artichoke dip with chips). Chips were freshly made with just the right amount of salt for flavor. Meatballs came hot, on a bed of mashed potatoes, and lightly drizzled with gravy. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad and, wow, it was on point! The light use of dressing, the crisp assorted lettuce and greens, nicely diced avocados, definitely enhanced and brought out the flavor of the seared Ahi. The Seared Ahi salad was proportioned nicely, not too big or too small. There was a generous amount of seared Ahi to balance the salad. Since we were celebrating her birthday, she took advantage of the dessert prior to her meal (and appetizers). Jafer comped her the dessert. I had also just signed up under their BJ app and received a free pizookie. And, although full, I did enjoy the very hot chocolate chip cookie with a nice serving of Vanilla ice cream after my meal. Lately most restaurants are slow to refill my water glass, fortunately for me,  they must have been observing me and kept my water glass full. Kudos to them. That's a huge plus. I commend both Jafer and Ruben for their outstanding service and to the restaurant staff for the hot, fresh, and timely food preparation.

0,Nicole F.,"San Diego, CA",337,851,1980.0,4.0,2017-11-11,"This is my 1st time dining at a BJ's. Spouse dined several times at the one in Culver City. He didn't like the salads but said the burgers are pretty good. Since they were offering Veterans a free meal up to $13 from their entire menu I just decided to go with the jalapeno bacon guacamole burger. This beef patty is prepared your way and even though we both ordered ours medium rare, only mine came that way while his was more medium well. Still, at a burger-bar-kind-of-place like this I never expect to get it how I ask. I was pleased that mine was medium rare. This was a healthy sized burger on a great tasting bun and they did not skimp on guacamole. It also had a ton of jalapenos and two strips of bacon. Definitely a decent burger for the price and their fries were piping hot and seasoned perfectly.  I'm not sure why the reviews on service are bad. We only had a five minute wait on a day where they were giving out free food. Our server was friendly and our food came out expeditiously and hot. I think it's a solid chain and I bumped them to that 4th star for opening up the entire menu on Veteran's day and giving great service and quality food. I would go back if in the area and craving a burger or maybe to try something else from the extensive menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista,3.52,2.96,2.884,,3.184
40,miguel l.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,15,4.0,1.0,2017-11-21,"The food is actually decent. But I've been here 3 times in the last few weeks and the servers and workers are horrible. They take forever, forget your food, don't clean up the table, Don't take dirty plates away from the table and overall it's not a welcoming environment. Today we had the waiter Mario and he apparently got insulted cause I had to remind him that he forgot to give me a refill twice early on the dinner, so a new waitress came over and told us she'd be taking over and he continued to wait the tables around us except us.......

17,Don B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,133,44.0,2.0,2017-11-22,"The kitchen takes so long to prepare your meal that you begin to wonder if the food is coming soon or do you need to return another time for it. The food comes to the table hot, but not always flavorful. Servers seem well intentioned, but end up being fairly ineffective. Stuffed baked potatoes come actually lacking in toppings. The chicken fried steak burger was so lacking in taste that the bright spot on the plate was the mashed potatoes we subbed for French fries. What is really interesting is that THIS particular BJ's does not meet the standards for food or service you normally experience at other local BJ's. Go to a different BJ's for a better meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista,3.44,2.96,2.872,,3.152

We had to send everything back except for one burger. We told them not to bring back the two burgers and to remove them from the check and waited a really long time for a luke warm french dip replacement.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=40,3.44,2.96,2.86,,3.152

I could tell he was busy but the service was still fantastic. We said we were in a rush so he thought about what he could do to make that easier for us. He brought a box and check without us even asking. Now a days this is rare at any restaurant. Someone who actually thinks about how to make your experience better, how they would like to be served. Nothing went unnoticed, from ranch on our pizza to apologizes about a mistake, everything was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=40,3.6,2.96,2.86,,3.216
19,Krystal L.,"San Diego, CA",4,21,5.0,1.0,2017-12-03,We called ahead and reserved a table from 6pm. We got seated and after 20 minutes of not receiving any service I said something to a server walking by. Turns out they sat us at a table with no server. Let me add they were not even that busy. A server who was already super busy with her tables took on our as well so I was not expecting great service. The kitchen did not bring out the appetizer we ordered so I asked that it be removed from the tab. I ordered a steak medium well and it was burned. I ate it anyway because I was starving. Only to go home and get diarrhea from the food. Will never be back here again.

16,Rock J.,"Chula Vista, CA",74,4,24.0,5.0,2017-12-10,"I don't usually write reviews, I just enjoy the food. But when the food is delicious and your server is on point, one can't help but to give praise. Our server, Ernesto, was both polite and humble. When you have someone coming to check up on you and making sure everything is to your satisfaction, you think that's just their job, but Ernesto anticipated our needs. We placed our dessert order at the same time we ordered dinner. When you do that, dessert tends to come out at the same time as your food. With that in mind, Ernesto advised us that he won't place the dessert order just yet. Cool beans!! Mid way through our meal, Ernesto comes back to tell us that he'll place our dessert order and that by the time we've finished eating, dessert should be on its way out. No sooner than I swallowed my last bite of steak, Ernesto is bringing out dessert. I know this might not seem like much to praise about, but for me, this type of service is golden. Thank you so much Ernesto!!! You are the reason I will be coming back to BJ's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista,3.6,3.0,2.848,,3.2400000000000007

43,Elizabeth T.,"Chula Vista, CA",370,5,4.0,2.0,2017-12-27,"Wasn't too impressed. It's was a busy night, but didn't look too crazy. When we got there we were told it would be a 20 minute wait, ended up being 40 minutes. We were finally sat and our server Mario was rather nice. We ordered our drinks and food. Our drinks came in plastic to go cups with lids and when our food finally came out, it didn't come out together. One persons soup and salad came out first and it was about another 10-15 minutes before the rest of the parties food came out. It was about another 5 minutes before the pizza came out. A different server brought out of pizza, and when it came we asked for cheese, plates to share the pizza, and refills on our drinks, he mumbled something and never came back. Mario returned and we placed our refill order with him. This time half the refills came out in plastic cups while the other half came out in regular glasses. When we finally finished our meal we waited a good while before our check appeared. While our server was very friendly and the food was decent. The wait times were outrageous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-chula-vista?start=20,3.16,2.92,2.836,,3.0160000000000005
