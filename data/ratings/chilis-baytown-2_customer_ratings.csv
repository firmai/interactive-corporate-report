23,allan h.,"Baytown, TX",2,48,,2.0,2014-02-21,The food always on point and service is ok for casual dining. I would give more stars if you all would just CLEAN YOUR TABLES AND YOUR MENUS!  I would hate to see this restaurant turn into a Sh-thole not hard to do if you work at it which seems apparent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

29,Louis N.,"Baytown, TX",0,3,,4.0,2014-08-04,The Tex Mex bowl was awesome!!!  Not oily at all like chipotle down the street. I customized it and it came out perfect.

15,Pam L.,"Baytown, TX",856,89,4766.0,4.0,2014-08-15,I am at my Chili's Grill & Bar location!.. The employees & manager's are professional in everything they do. The atmosphere is pleasant!

27,Satir A.,"Baytown, TX",0,4,,1.0,2015-02-14,"Came here for dessert, got a skillet cookie and 2 glasses of water....THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE WATER!!! When did they start charging for water?? Mind it, I am a generous tipper but this is ridiculous if they charged me for a bigger tip. After handing him the money for the bill, no questions asked, came back with my change slamming it on the table and while looking away said ""have a nice night"". I hope this guy adjusts his attitude even after receiving a nice tip for the bullshit service and non sense charges.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2?start=20,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

Pepper to go and he said ""wait let see if I have time"".... And he was just extremely rude. And today we order to go and in my sister's food there was a roach!

19,Penelope G.,"Houston, TX",11,34,1.0,1.0,2015-07-11,"My husband and I met some friends here for supper tonight. I ordered the mango chile chicken. When it came, it looked uncooked, and a tentative taste did not change my mind. In spite of several passes at our table, I could not get the waitress' attention to inform her, and it was not until the rest of my party was finished eating that I was able to lodge my complaint. She blamed both the taste and texture on their infrared cooking and asked if I wanted something else. No. No, Chili's, I prefer my meals cooked, by a human with at least moderate culinary prowess, not nuked on a conveyor belt, thankyouverymuch. The rest of my table was unimpressed as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
16,James A.,"Houston, TX",1,10,3.0,1.0,2015-08-30,"We went to the chili's location by San Jacinto mall in Baytown, Texas Texas. We entered and 2 employees were standing at the podium and no one greeted us. Finally we asked if we should seat ourselves? Then we were finally seated. The manager and shift crew were talking by our booth and they said nothing.We waited 10 minutes and no one came to the table. Truly I believe this location is biased about interracial couples and this is why they refused to give service but that is fine I don't have to lower my standards to be served by people like them.  Therefore we spent our money at Mc Donald s. We will no longer be frequenting chili's restaurants. If there were negative stars I would give negative 6.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
17,Darren S.,"Fresno, TX",9,111,143.0,3.0,2015-10-16,"Service was good. Each table has a kiosk(ipad), where you can place your own orders and pay when you're ready to leave. No more waiting for a server. The server was very pleased to show how it worked. I don't think she realized that she's outsourcing her job as a waitress,  now her job is more of being a server. Other than the irony in that it was a typical experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
12,Danielle U.,"Dallas, TX",90,147,38.0,4.0,2015-10-20,Ok. I like chili's...I really do. Went last night and sat at a table in the bar. Our server was Brandy. Their half order of cheese fries is just enough for two people who want to have room for food. They should do better with the cheese and bacon...layer it: but honestly no one does this. They should. If you like ribs...they're good here. Often over sauced but I'm okay with that. Only get them at dinner...lunchtime ribs may not be as tender. He got a Mexican combination plate. He enjoyed it. He asked for salsa on the side and it was like water. Huge downside.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
14,Michelle A.,"Braeswood Place, Houston, TX",85,20,34.0,4.0,2016-01-14,"I've been to this Chili's about 3 or 4 times during lunch and have not had any major problems at all. I typically stick to salads or tacos. The Mexican dishes are definitely more Americanized but still were not bad. The salads are a great choice. If you are picky about dressing, ask them to put on the side so you can make sure you like them. Service has been great and quick. I always tell them I'm on lunch break so they put my order in quick. I will definitely come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
18,Damaris F.,"Lake Placid, FL",0,25,3.0,4.0,2016-01-20,"We had second thoughts about going to this Chili's because of some bad reviews about the service. But recently we gave it a try. On our first visit we went for lunch, had a great service and food was delicious. We went for a second time,  for dinner. Our experience was good. Food was excellent. The place was busy, we were in the tables around the bar. Bartender was our server, he was busy, but got help from other coworkers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
4,Lorena T.,"Houston, TX",196,212,577.0,2.0,2016-03-08,"So tonight it's rainy and this chilis is close to home. Plus! I had some rewards to use so after not knowing what to eat we ended up here for dinner.  Service was a bit slow but our waitress was also training a new waiter so ""patience"".  She constantly checked on us through out our time there.  Customer service is not top notch here.  We have seen interactions with the managers and employees that are not the best.  There is only one bar tender so we had to wait quite a bit to get our margaritas.  But the wait was worth it.  The margaritas tasted great And our food was good and filling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
6,Matt S.,"Papillion, NE",9,38,57.0,4.0,2016-03-20,"Came in here with a crew of 20 guys from work after a long days work and our server was awesome! Our drinks were always full, our appetizers came out in a very timely manner, our food came out and was made correctly. Not a very common Occurrence with a group this large.  The server recommended the quesadilla salad and I was not disappointed. So good would come back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
13,Lanelle L.,"Baytown, TX",20,9,1.0,3.0,2016-04-16,"The food & service here is typically pretty good...in fact, it's one of my favorite restaurants!

9,Camilla M.,"Houston, TX",88,59,525.0,4.0,2016-04-29,"This is a very nice Chili's location. It's right off the freeway when you exit Garth Rd, in Baytown. The staff is always friendly and the service is usually pretty quick. They are very attentive to your needs. They don't disappear while your trying to look for them. The manager, (female)  in the evening, is very friendly as well. It's a little cold in the restaurant, so make sure you take a light jacket in case you are cold natured.  I frequently place orders Togo online.  They have a really good online order placement in tact. However, my orderr has been incorrect a few times so you may want to check it before leaving the restaurant. I have contacted the store about the incorrect order and they quickly sent a coupon in the mail for a free item. Thanks for redeeming yourself Chili's. That's good customer service in my book. I would go here again, but turn up the heat a little",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
22,Tara P.,"Katy, TX",0,12,,1.0,2016-05-09,"Lunch time...been here a few times during the week and the hostess is on par to be late as people pile up to be seated.   The iced tea kept lacking the ice, even after we asked for it in our to go cups.  Just seems that the staff here doesn't care at all.  Not a good place for lunch if you are a working person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2?start=20,,,,,
20,Natalie G.,"Baytown, TX",0,1,,1.0,2016-07-02,"I worked here and let me tell you, once I quitted I feel like so much got off my shoulders. The manager is so rude, I quit and went off on me and said to not put her on any job recommendations bc she wasn't going to leave a good one; so rude and horrible attitude, i understand I quit 10 minutes before my shift, but enough is enough w putting up with a a RUDE JOB & service. I'm NOT stopping anyone from coming here but I hope you are prepared to deal with some none caring rude people, save ur money and go to road house or Buffalo Wild Wings at least the workers and managers are nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2?start=20,,,,,
7,Alecia M.,"Beaumont, TX",0,19,55.0,1.0,2016-07-04,Employees follow the leader and the manager here is terrible. He watched me use a menu to scrape salt and crumbs away when I went to sit at bar...he just watched and never offered to wipe down the area. He talked business with an employee about how they need to make 1895.00 to 'catch up' then bad mouthed a customer after he got off the phone...he laughed bc they want to bring back an under cooked steak instead of microwaving it. Employees show no signs of wanting to provide excellent service either. Dirty place! Skip this stop and go anywhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,
5,Merdz E.,"Baytown, TX",290,69,349.0,3.0,2016-08-29,Went here with a friend for a quick bite. The food here is okay. Nothing spectacular. Service was not either. I liked the face that I could just pay for my bill through that little tablet type thing on the table. I got a fudge cake for desert and it was decent. I could tell it was microwaved though. It came out super fast and the bottom was pretty hard.  Nonetheless that didn't not really bother me because I could barely eat half of it anyway. I will more than likely be back. They have good chicken strips lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,,,,,

She came back with our drink we ordered our food and I ordered a margarita. Our appetizer came out shortly but took forever for our food to come out. The food was ok nothing to brag about and I was disappointed in my food, the southwest egg rolls use to be great now they are disgusting..... Check finally came.... Did I get my margarita?? NO!!!

11,Armando M.,"Baytown, TX",0,14,,3.0,2016-12-08,"I never dine in here, but very often i call in To-go. They have never messed up my order but every time i call they put me on hold for at least 2-3 minutes. I get there and they have no one at the to-go counter, you need to go to the bar and pick up your order from the bartender. Bartenders are always busy and they don't have time to help a to-go customer. So i have to wait a while to get my order and cash out. This is every time i call in a to-go. I really like their Honey chipotle Chicken crispers but i have to go through this annoying process to get them. Staff is nice but they need to improve in every area, to-go is one of them. I wont say anything about their service in other areas because like i said i only call in to-gos and their system isn't very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
3,Seven S.,"McKinney, TX",0,35,33.0,1.0,2016-12-20,"Not sure why, when eating alone the hostess always wants to dump you at the bar. I still enjoy sitting in the ambiance of a restaurant.  So I gave my typical response to this question and said no.  Apparently the Manager's training day for this team member didn't address how to handle this response. The hostess looked dumbfounded and just stared into the bar I then look into an empty restaurant and ask, is there no place to sit in this empty restaurant?  She says there is but,  I'm not sure what to do because I was supposed to sit you at bar area  I left immediately because I have no patience for incompetence.  Too bad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
8,Jessica S.,"College Station, TX",237,3,,2.0,2017-08-04,"I rarely eat at chili's because the service is always mediocre. I decided to order togo food online tonight & it took a ridiculous amount of time for my order to be ready. I arrived right at the time the website told me to giving them about 25 minutes in advance to prepare my order. The way their togo area is set up, you can see directly into their kitchen. I watched the poor togo girl ask about my order for about 30 minutes with little response from the kitchen staff. She apologized to me a number of times even though it clearly wasn't her fault. I manage a restaurant myself (have worked in the kitchen and in the front) and not a single manager approached me about my order taking so long, which in my opinion is what should happen when a guest's experience isn't what it should be. Also, in my opinion, if your guests can see inside of your kitchen, you should make an effort to practice cleanliness. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of how sweet the togo girl was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
0,Dougie B.,"Highlands, TX",6,62,2.0,3.0,2017-09-02,Wife and I have eaten here for lunch many times and the service has been good. The food is typical Chilies fare and we seem to always get the Southwest egg rolls. The wife likes the chicken crispers and I go for the half rack of ribs and margarita chicken. The ribs always seem way over done to me almost dry. But it's still tasty! I hate that Chilies discontinued the cooked apples - they were one item that I really liked! Now they are gone! Sad!  We will be back for lunch again in the future!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
2,David L.,"Highlands, TX",2,71,124.0,3.0,2017-09-26,Eating here is always a mixed experience. First off this is a huge chain restaurant so to expect food that's not pre prepared and dropped in a deep fryer is naive. Everything here is just ok.

1,Hailea M.,"Houston, TX",6,15,6.0,1.0,2017-11-28,"I am currently sitting in this Chili's. My family and I all got varying dishes and honestly none of us were satisfied. My salad came out at the same time as my entree and my salad tasted dirty and was wilting. The side of chili we ordered was not the Chili all other Chili's serves and was obviously out of a can and burned. Two of our orders were mixed up (wrong sides etc;). None of us got dressings as we ordered with our meals and to top it off... My brother  found an 18 in long hair baked into the skin on his chicken. He pulled at the hair and the chicken itself got lifted off he plate.  We told our waitress about the situation and she was visibly shocked and apologetic. After a few minutes a woman who we assumed was the manager (not sure as she didn't introduce herself) came and quietly sat the food down in front of him.  At this point no one at the table could eat and we sat there quietly until our sweet but unprofessional waitress came to give us the bill. Upon receipt of this we saw that there are no deductions from our bill and we were never apologized to by management.  Honestly, I understand this is Baytown but can we not do any better? **Edit - after realizing our bill was over $150 for 5 people we asked that the meal with hair in it be removed. The woman we guess was the manager (we were correct) finally came back over and when we explained we just wanted it removed and that we were upset she didn't come to apologize before she remarked ""OHKAY. Well ACTUALLY I did apologize when I gave him his food and I did remove it from your ticket - your sever must have added it back on. So there was a miscommunication THERE."" And she promptly walked away with out waiting for a response from us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-baytown-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
