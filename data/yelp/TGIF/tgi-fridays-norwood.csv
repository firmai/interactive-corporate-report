Lewej W.,"Dallas, TX",401,30,4,3.0,8/21/2013,"Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo slow!!! Our waitress seemed like she was relatively new, but she was decent. She lolly-gagged a bit with checking on us when our food took forever and the restaurant was relatively slow. The food arrived after an eon but it was good. Everything was well-cooked and as we ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood
Vivian C.,"Boston, MA",126,1441,14611,3.0,8/19/2010,"It was late (past 11pm) and we hadn't had dinner yet, and were driving down Route 1 North.  TGIFriday's was lit, with cars in the front lot.  So, there you go!  Or actually, there we went.  Yeah, we had to U-Turn. It took a while to get someone's attention at the lobby so we could get seated at a booth - the bar was hopping, but too noisy for our current mood. The place was chill - not chill/cool, but chill/cold.  Oh well, some hot tea and food would warm us up! We ordered the dumpling appetizer, and one of their $12.99 three course meals - mozzarella sticks, prime rib stroganoff, vanilla bean cheesecake - to share. The dumplings arrived six to an order, nicely browned on the bottom, but a little moist on the dumpling skin like they sweated a bit.  The mozzarella were flat crispy sticks that arrived 5-6 to an order.  The stroganoff was mighty creamy with these cool long curly edged close to al dente noodles, tender well-done pieces of prime rib and a whole bunch of onions (still crisp yet cooked all the way through) and some sliced mushrooms.  The cheesecake was really sweet and a really soft creamy sort of dessert. Nothing stood out as something I HAVE to get again, but everything was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood
Lanette D.,"Dracut, MA",1,18,,1.0,3/13/2013,"Used to go to TGI Friday's all the time. We went on a Saturday for lunch and the food was cold, seemed to be precooked. Cannot believe how down hill the quality has gone on the food here. So disappointed. G our waiter was the only good thing at this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood

Natalie R.,"Hightstown, NJ",3,15,,2.0,2/20/2013,"Ordered 5 meals To Go today for my work office. They forgot the grilled chicken cobb salad (and when we did get it, they forgot the bacon and it was 99% lettuce). We also ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken w/ tortellinis. They gave us THREE. So i went back, told them and they only gave us THREE more. I did call the customer relations line and left a comment about this. They said they will tell the general manager but we are never going back. I also heard two ladies behind me at the bar talking about how they had just witnessed two other customers from the bar area leaving ""pissed off"". I'd stay away from this location at least if possible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood
S G.,"Walpole, MA",2,19,,1.0,7/28/2009,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!! Got take-out about a month ago and there were tons of BUGS - slimy disgusting BUGS IN OUR FOOD!!!!! Called and complained (on the edge of a full-blown hysteria, I cannot even tell how absolutely disgusting this was). Spoke to a night manager who took my information and told me my dinner would be free if I came back - I replied I would not come back, I was fifteen minutes away in pajamas and too revolted to walk back through the door. He assured me that I would receive a gift certificate in the mail covering the cost of my two dinners, which I verified could be used at any location. To this day I have received nothing. BUGS IN THE FOOD!!!!!! Enough said?? **runs away to puke again**",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood

James A.,"Norwood, MA",2,35,,2.0,4/26/2012,"Fridays chain is not the best. It is ALWAYS inconsistent! This location is probably one of the worst probably because it is so slow. I recently got the 3 course meal, and the dumplings for an appetizer were fair, but we're over cooked and dry. Some kind of chicken pasta for the entree. The chicken was burnt to a crisp, and dry and not much flavor in the overall dish. And finally the Oreo cookie ice cream cookie for dessert which was gross. The actual cookie had no flavor, and was probably one of the worst desserts I have ever had. If I were you I'd skip this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-norwood
