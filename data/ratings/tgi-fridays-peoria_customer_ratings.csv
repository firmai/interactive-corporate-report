17,Jack R.,"Peoria, IL",4,165,100.0,3.0,2012-05-19,Standard TGI Fridays. Nice ceiling to floor windows in the bar seating area. You cannot get to the parking lot from war Memorial Drive. You have to come from way behind on Landens Way near the Country Inn.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
15,Sara B.,"Peoria, IL",0,27,1.0,1.0,2013-10-05,"The food is great for a chain restaurant. Service is always really stellar. However, the last three times I've been to this location, I have had to send back my steaks. The first two times, I ordered medium rare and got medium well. No big deal, though, because the problem was fixed and the steaks were pretty good. This latest time, we both ordered ribeye. The server informed us there would be a 30 minute wait as they were out of ribeye at the moment. No big deal for us. We like to take our time with the appetizers anyway. When our steaks came to the table, they were completely different cuts of meat. My fiance's was just fine. Mine was about a half inch thick and so wide it took up half the plate. Ribeye's supposed to be marbled with fat, but over a third of my steak was comprised of hard gristle. It was done exactly how I ordered it: rare. However, the texture was mealy and it just was not at all worth the money. I have never in my life seen a ribeye steak that looked like what I received. This still isn't a big deal to me, but I send it back anyway because it was really disappointing. Up until this point, our experience was fine and our service was good. However, one of the managers came out to speak with us and informed me that she ""knows steak really well"" and ""ribeye is supposed to be fatty and that's what makes it so good"". That's fine and dandy, but if by some slim chance I was mistaken and what I received was ribeye, it was an extremely subpar cut of meat. This manager continued to quibble with us and made me extremely uncomfortable. I didn't really know what else I could possibly say and she still stood there expecting something of us. I did get another steak, but this manager's attitude completely put me off. I have had really good service at other TGI Fridays and at other locations, my food has come to the table how it was ordered. I will not be returning to this location under any circumstance because of how humiliated I felt by the manager's treatment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
14,Ray B.,"Royal Oak, MI",12,273,4.0,3.0,2013-10-13,"While I refrain from chain restaurants, we had a nice experience here.  The service was good, there was variety in the menu and the desserts were tasty.  However, the tables are very close together so our neighbors joined in our conversation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
11,Todd R.,"Raleigh, NC",4,18,3.0,1.0,2014-01-31,"Our first time here ever. Food took 45 minutes to arrive. And it was nothing to write home about. Drinks were served 70% ice. When my wife requested to remove some of the ice, they brought back the glass less than half full. Out of spite maybe?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
16,Zack L.,"Peoria, IL",16,11,,3.0,2014-05-12,"Unfortunately this location has gone downhill. I wonder if they have a new manager or have just had a lot of staff turnover. I visited this location with a party of three last week, and we were seated outside in the garage/patio hybrid area despite not asking to sit outside. They had told us we would have a ten minute wait, and that was fine with us. As we walked through the restaurant, it looked about a third empty. I have no idea why they wanted us to wait ten minutes. We asked to be seated in the dining area and were relocated. One of my friends ordered a bruschetta appetizer that had frozen tomatoes on it. It was not appetizing. Being a Stripes Reward member, we were treated to free chips and salsa. Unfortunately the chips were either stale or undercooked, and were chewy as a result. My sandwich was pretty good and my girlfriend's steak was cooked well, but our friend's chicken and shrimp dish left a lot to be desired. The shrimp was downright sad. This is really too bad as I previously loved this location a lot. I'll now be going across the street to Old Chicago the next time I want to go to a restaurant/bar at night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
12,S H.,"Peoria, IL",0,3,,1.0,2014-06-11,Good service but very low quality food. Everything is over salted and poor ingredients.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
13,Critic X.,"Mount Zion, IL",11,66,13.0,2.0,2014-07-14,I agree with the two star rating. I'd give three if the service was better. Totally oblivious to our table and our needs during the meal. Didn't keep drinks topped up (except with ice) and didn't notice the order was wrong before it left the kitchen. French dip was good but tiny. Macaroni and cheese is fantastic. Side salads are in teeny tiny little ramekins.  Iced tea is weak. Service was inattentive. Shrimp with the sizzling chicken dish was not good. Overpriced and lower than expected overall quality.  Room for improvement.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
8,Lianne N.,"Davenport, IA",39,198,63.0,4.0,2014-10-16,"Our service was great.  The food was typical.  I was afraid to come because the reviews seemed to indicate we'd be there for hours on end waiting for our food.  Happily, it was a nice night, and nothing was worth noting beyond the norm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
10,Becky A.,"Peoria, IL",1,34,,3.0,2014-11-01,"We have been eating here a lot we have been sat in the resturant and bar there are always the same 4 to 6 loud and obnoxious people at the bar drinking. On our last trip to the restaurant they were in the same spot and to my suprise 3 of them where employees of the resturant, I know this cause they had their swipe cards for the resturant. As much as we love the burgers and the chef right now knows how to cook a burger right we won't go back for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
9,Sabrina W.,"Moline, IL",1,1,11.0,1.0,2015-04-04,Very poor service food took forever then they forgot half the order. Was not fast at all very overpriced for what we got....my grandson pucked his supper up and they stood around arguing who was gonna clean it up if we would've had any napkins we would've cleaned it up....took them forever for the bill so we could leave after everything.....will NEVER go back...not worth any stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,

2,Jen B.,"Peoria, IL",40,405,99.0,1.0,2016-11-08,"A complete disaster from start to finish! Visited at lunch when the place is 3/4 empty with a large group and we have a single waitress. We waited 45 minutes for our food with most of us getting salads or the meals with the clock next to them that should indicate ""faster option"". My slider buns were burned completely black so I had to remove the meat from them and I saw the same thing at another table when I walked to the bathroom. My Caesar salad was made from the grossest, slimiest brownest lettuce I've ever been served at a restaurant. Then it took another 20 minutes after they cleared our uneaten food away for them to bring the checks. There is nothing in the world that could ever make me return to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
6,Chris A.,"Champaign, IL",0,18,1.0,2.0,2016-11-19,"My 14 year old son liked the burger (although it was well done) but everything else fell short. The sizzling chicken and shrimp was at least 10 mins pat sizzling and dried out from the heat lamps. This is a management issue, not a food quality problem. They earned both of those stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
5,Amy W.,"Dunlap, IL",0,7,,2.0,2017-04-02,Waited 30 minutes for food to arrive even though there wasn't many people there.  Ordered a ceaser side salad and had to ask for it to be brought out before my meal. The food was good but it was not worth the wait.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
1,Pat C.,"Calgary, Canada",6,83,167.0,2.0,2017-06-19,"This model is tired. The food lacks flair and style. I don't blame this brand but come America quit settling for this crap. Change your menu and ""lighten"" up",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
4,Robert B.,"Edwards, IL",11,71,112.0,2.0,2017-07-04,They sell the fridays potato skins in the frozen food section.  Stick with that.  Typical fridays you can cook frozen food at home that is as good if not better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
3,Mcklaire H.,"Peru, IL",96,3,18.0,1.0,2017-08-16,"Went in around 9 pm, there was maybe 5 other tables with people. Took forever to get our food and when we did it was awful. The chicken quesadillas were soggy and you could tell they were just thrown in a microwave. Wouldn't recommend TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
0,Kristen C.,"Chicago, IL",64,409,712.0,4.0,2017-09-04,"Darrin was our server/bartender. He was seriously awesome and ON TOP of everything. Honestly the staff in general was very friendly and they seemed to really help each other out-was impressive to see this. We did the endless apps...he had our orders in super quick and him or someone else ran the food out quick. Always had full drinks. Store appeared clean. The reviews made me hesitant but this crew that was working noon on Labor Day is 5 star...for that I would return. After a full weekend of having drinks we ate a wide variety of the options...all good... recommend the cheese sticks, meatballs and flat bread. Boyfriend said chicken quesadilla was his pick. NOTE: Endless apps ONLY mon-Thurs. Price is $12. Just a heads up if going by website as it's different info.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-peoria,,,,,
