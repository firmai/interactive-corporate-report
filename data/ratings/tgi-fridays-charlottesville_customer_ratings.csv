7,Jack X.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,2,,1.0,2012-11-03,"I went there for dinner with my girlfriend on Saturday. We ordered some appetizer and entrees. But the portion of the green bean fries was so small! I can even count the number of them! Only 10-15 of them! (The price is seven bucks, so technically each fries costs 50c!) I asked the manager, but he told me the size is common. Come on! DON'T LIE TO THE CUSTOMER! I have been to Friday's many times in many places! Obviously he was trying to fool me. He then brought out 10 extra ones. However, even worse the sizzling chicken my girlfriend ordered was two tiny little pieces (the smallest chicken piece I have ever seen!) and the shrimps are also extremely tiny! I was very mad, but we did not ask him because we know he will lie to us again. After being treated like this we decided that we will never go there again! Friday's sucks in Charlottesville! I will avoid it at any costs!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
6,Mary C.,"Charlottesville, VA",2,16,,1.0,2012-11-15,"Service was slow. Food was bland to inedible. Waitstaff slow, disinterested and slovenly. Lampshade missing in booth. Menu has changed for the worst. Never will go again. Do not recommend. Disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
3,Chris E.,"Columbus, OH",50,96,115.0,2.0,2013-06-21,Service is very slow. Lacking qualified servers. Food was not hot and management was non-existent.  Staff has dressed down to blue jeans now!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
5,Tom T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,11,1.0,2.0,2013-12-13,"My parents were in town and I had a $25 gift certificate, so we thought we'd check it out. The place was overly loud and perhaps a bit rowdy; we had the bar on one side, and families with kids on the other. My poor dad couldn't hear much of our conversation. ""My salad was fine, I couldn't taste it 'cause of the noise!"" He said. Oh well. My ribeye and ribs was really sub par - kind of a slight notch above cardboard. Disappointing for the price, especially after experiencing a $26 New York strip at Maya last weekend, which was so outstanding, I swirled each bite around my mouth before chewing it thoroughly.  We learned our lesson. I won't go back, unless I'm going there to get drunk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
4,Justin Q.,"Charlottesville, VA",27,19,,4.0,2014-11-30,This well known chain restaurant carries on a great tradition of simple American dining and a well stocked bar. The ribs are always too notch and the friendly sevice is very helpful and does a great job. Also a great location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
1,Ken M.,"Charlottesville, VA",4,13,23.0,5.0,2015-06-04,"Our foursome chose this location for our tri-weekly dinner out. The food was absolutely perfect, menu-pic quality! I had the Au Ju with mashed potatoes: . My wife had the turkey burger with fries, and our guests had steaks....again, the mashed potatoes . All had a great time. Our insanely professional sever was Tim, A+ (with his permission, I'm posting a pic of him from our visit). He addressed our every request in a timely manner. He was polite and well spoken, he showed good improv skills when hit with odd questions (my specialty). **We were disappointed that the establishment does NOT offer a senior discount for my elder guests but felt compelled to inform us that they only offer a military discount (who would not?) but no students? No seniors? Meh. DO TRY THE PRETZEL BREADSTICKS. YUM, omg.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
2,Raj D.,"Chantilly, VA",0,9,,1.0,2015-06-22,This is the 5th time that I've come here and something is always wrong. I believe it will be my last time. This time the place had no nachos available for lunch.   The bartender never acknowledges me every time I come in either by myself or with business clients.  The service is way below TGI Friday's standards. From the past few experiences it seems as though it's never really Friday here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
0,Deniese L.,"Denver, CO",151,124,72.0,4.0,2015-08-01,"Their drinks are the only thing that keeps bringing me back. Most of their Jack Daniels foods (chicken shrimp etc) are always good, and their new ahi tuna mini tacos appetizer was amazing. Other than that there's not much to Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-charlottesville,,,,,
