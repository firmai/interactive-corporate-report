28,Drew L.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",469,155,,2.0,2012-05-31,"I have been to this location twice within the past month. The menu is pretty much the same as the locations in NC and California. Red Robin is consistent in that you can pretty much have your favorite menu items no matter where you are. There is nothing surprising in that aspect. The food is good but certainly not anything to rave about. It's a burger and fries place.  The problem here is the service. It's not good. Our server was Michael and I got the impression from the time we were seated that he was not happy to have another table. We experienced unreasonable long waits for drinks, appetizers and our burgers. In the time between the long waits, we didn't see our server at the table. That was disappointing because we needed more drinks, etc.  A retaurant like this is not going to wow you with their menu. It doesn't change. These places have to wow you with good service and friendly servers who make you want to come back. That didn't happen for us either time. I went along with Red Robin the second time because my friends like Big Bleu Burger. I won't be talked into it as easily next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=40,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.016000000000001

We asked to see the manager for a bottled beer at same price. After 10 minutes we finally were granted a free sauce on one burger.  We ordered the smaller burger, no flavor, mine was burned.

He asked for it to be lightly toasted not too hard. He has braces. It seemed like a simple request but I guess it was too difficult for the cook.  I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter.  Can you say Yuck because I can!  I won't be ordering that again.chicken tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave and partially cooked or freezer burned.

Not because they were that busy because once we got in there were a lit of empty tables.  So I am thinking understaffed. When we showed up were told 20-30 min wait. Ok not great but the family voted that we would wait it out. So we began our wait outside, we were the only ones sittting outside. When enough space opened up to come sit and wait inside we moved on in. Now as our time got close a party of 5 walked up, said they had been waiting outside and had missed their names being called. The hostess stood strong at first, and told them they would have to go back on the list. Good job, but then one of the mother's started complaining about how its not fair they missed their call and they have kids and what ever else she said. Well the hostess caved and bumpes everyone back a few spots to support moving this party of five in.  Now I'm sorry but that is not right and when we spoke with the manager he did nothing to correct the issuse.  So even with the good service we got from our waiter and the food was pretty good. I am unsure if I will be eating at Red Robin again. $54.00 is a lot for 4 bugeres and 4 waters and a small stack of rings to not be treated fairly.

21,Larry S.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",6,8,1.0,2.0,2015-12-20,"We went to dinner last night at this Red Robin.  It was the worst experience ever at this location.  First they sat us right under an air conditioning vent and it was blowing cold air.  I was told that they were not able to do anything with it since it is controlled by corporate out in Colorado.  Usually airconditioning is not so bad but when it is 30 degrees outside it does make the restaurant feel like it is also 30 degrees.  We moved to another table and this was about 10 minutes before anyone even came over to us even just to take drink order.  That was before we moved.  After the  move we had a waiter named Dillon.  He is the reason we gave this review a 2 star instead of 1 or even zero,  He took our order and he was fantastic.  I did order my burger medium and it came out black on the outside.  I did not even have to cut into it to see that it was way too done for me.  Also, before we even received our food, the table next to us was getting up to leave.   Normally that is good unless they came in well after us which they did,. We were there literally two hours for no reason other than a real slow kitchen.  Management knew nothing of the problems that we had but Dillon did get a manager for me at my request and they took care of me by taking care of my meal.  Last night was just a bad night but when everything got straightened out the food was actually good.  I do appreciate Dillons patience with me because after a bit I was getting prretty upset.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-myrtle-beach?start=40,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.1760000000000006,3.1600000000000006

3,Neil P.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",175,82,158.0,3.0,2016-12-18,"I can so see the bottom of those bottomless fries... My server was great and the food was decent but the prices left me paying awful close attention to every bite. I've found if I start out making the stink face at the prices, chances are I won't be won over by the end of the evening. Such was the case here.  I'm big on the word 'appropriate' in ""price appropriate."" 28.00 for a burger and 2 shakes (before tip) just set a bad tone with me. For those prices I expect to find the antidote in my burger!  I was also with a guy who got the bottomless fries. They actually make this process so difficult that it practically deters one from ordering more, which I suspect is rather the point. Seriously, they bring you like 8 fries and then you have to flag down the server, order again and wait for another 8 fries. They really need to boost the serving size; it boarders on the absurd. Now, I don't know about you but after I've eaten, I just want to give the guy my cash and go. Not so fast here...my server had to give us a class on how to use the tabletop checkout  machine because they don't give paper tickets. Press here if you want to split the ticket, press here if you want to add or subtract an item and put it in the other persons column, press here for the tip, press here for....""dude, that's what I pay you guys for - just take my cash and bring me my change so I can leave!"" So, yeah, not a fan of the self checkout. It was truly like the ""common core"" equivalent of paying for a meal. Twice as difficult than it needed to be. I just want to give you my card or cash...you give me some change and/or a receipt and I get to leave. I felt like I needed divorce papers to get out of here. Anyway, 3 stars for a clean restaurant and attentive server. The prices and the laborious check-out would give me pause in the future. How about this. You want to trouble your patrons to check themselves out, take 20% of the meal for saving the server the effort. After all, our time is valuable too! Most of us are tired of seeing a tip jar on every counter as it is; now even the most rudimentary of table service is becoming self service. Maddening!

See that little icon under my name to the left that says, ""Follow this person on yelp?""...click that! We'll be buds! Seriously, do it.
