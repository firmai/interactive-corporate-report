Couple the old menu with slow service and you come up with...

17,Jenny K.,"Detroit, MI",311,195,2139.0,3.0,2014-02-20,"My husband and I tried this place before our movie started at AMC 20 down the street, during happy hour. Upon walking in, I was greeted by a gentleman who later turned out to be our waiter. His name was Harold; he was very nice and attentive and seated us right away at the bar. I ordered a frozen Strawberry Margarita to start, per Harold's recommendation. It was so good! My hubby ordered his Blue Moon and we sipped away waiting for our food. It took a little longer than normal to get our food out. For the sake of picking out something quick and of minimal options to choose from, we did the 2 for $20 deal which included one appetizer and 2 entrees. It seemed a bit rushed once Harold realized we both finished our beverages and nothing had come out yet.  When our appetizer finally did come out, our food came out 2 minutes later. I have to say...I hate that. There is no point in ordering an appetizer when this happens because all you'll want to eat is your actual meal. We ordered the fried cheese as our appetizer, which is 7 mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce. I love these in general, but these were ok and a ""safe"" option. They came out semi-warm, which indicated they had been ready for a bit before being brought out. I ordered the chicken fajitas for my entree and my hubby ordered the honey chicken crispers. The fajitas came out sizzling, as they should, and tasted good. The tortillas were soft and warm; everything tasted fresh. My husband enjoyed his crispers as well. They came with homestyle fries and a corn on the cob. They reminded me of the honey BBQ boneless wings from BDubs. Everything tasted very good and came out fresh. Overall, I liked our meal and enjoyed our quick stop in there. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would hope to go at a time when it wasn't so busy. Our waiter was really trying his best to accommodate us but was given too many tables all over the place. Worth a try if you're in the area; you can't beat getting 2 decent meals and an appetizer for $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

This location is pretty decent, on the particular day we went it was just cold inside the restaurant and it didn't help that we sat close to the togo door even though no one came that early to get anything to go. We had the skillet queso which was good, thick the way I like it. I prefer Chili's queso to the ""cheese sauce"" they serve at the ""mexican"" restaurants in the area. We came for lunch and I wanted something lighter and I finally tried their ""Lighter Choices"" menu. Their mango-chili chicken was really awesome!

Ordered a appetizer which was queso spinach dip before ordering entrees, waited 15 minutes for a appetizer that should have taken   5 -8 minutes tops, your putting chips on a plate and heating the cheese sauce.The server should have been checking to ensure it was being made or ready but not until my pop was sitting empty along with the chips and runny salsa did she bother to check on our appetizer. So we get the appetizer it's ok and within 5- 8 minutes are food arrived, so we didn't finish the appetizer, and you could tell they held our food in the kitchen because my skillet meal was not sizzling like other skillet meals around me and the chicken meal was barley luke warm! My sirloin was chewy and tough, but I guess I should have known better then to order a steak at a Chili's...It was obvious they had our  meals ready right after finally getting our appetizer and had to hold the food so it didn't come out within minutes of the app. The server should be more attentive to her guests food order, and when I ordered I mentioned 2x what size steak I wanted and after she walked away she came back and asked me again ( which makes 3x now) what size steak to ""just make sure"" I guess the 2x I told her was not enough. All in all it was not an enjoyable meal and service is mediocre at best, considering the server doesn't even take the payments, they have their guests pay their bills which wouldn't bother me if the server was doing a better job and was more engaged in making sure her timing and the foods timing was done appropriately.  Disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

There are more unbussed empty tables than there are occupied ones and still a 5 minute wait to be seated. When taken to our section we see that this side of the resturant is completely empty and tables are ready for customers, so we are unclear on the reason for the wait. Then there was the headache when using the rewards points. The issue was eventually resolved but the server made it clear that the manager was making an exception. We had ordered the white queso dip and chili con queso dip was what was delivered to our table. At best it was comparable to dog food. I had to show the server the photo that was displayed on the rewards offer for understand what I was talking about. Everything about this visit was awful. Our salad came out before the appetizer. Then when the correct appetizer came it was literally 45 seconds until our main course was delivered. Our table was so full of plates that it was hard to eat in a comfortable manner.

34,Dave H.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",179,175,82.0,2.0,2017-04-17,The worst Chili's I've ever been to. Food tastes/ looks like it was dumped on a plate from a microwaved ziplock meanwhile the ambiance is the everlasting feeling of a crappy work trip and this is next door to your hotel.  Our waitress was nice but very absent. Had to run her down to cash out.  Crispy asparagus?  Don't. It's gross. Just don't. Overlooked to hell and a waste of money.  Had grilled chicken. It came out tender which is great but man it just seemed like it was premade. The rice it came with was partially over and partially undercooked.  Make the trip to the Auburn Hills location.  That is the only location I will ever go to a chili's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
37,Elizabeth Y.,"Northville, MI",0,30,,4.0,2017-06-13,"Brenda is the best waitress we've had so far. Judging by the other reviews, I wonder if we've just gotten lucky, usually being waited on by her.  I've only tried a few menu items unfortunately. I got hooked on the chili queso and the smothered burrito. But both are very tasty!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
47,Gee S.,"Romulus, MI",0,27,,2.0,2017-08-03,"This Chili's is down the street from my job. I used to go there to get their triple pick meal which was hot wings, potato skins and spinach dip..the best. They stopped selling this.Then I discovered their ribs which were basted with sprite/7-up, root beer, I can't quite remember, but they were Awesome! That's no longer on the menu as well.  I don't really go to Chili's much unless someone else suggest going and I tag along. I will order a fajita. I needed a quick lunch today and Chili's is near by. So, decided to go and try the original ribs...Awful! The barbeque sauce was slapped on top of the ribs, not cooked into them. All I could taste was barbeque sauce and not the best either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

39,Willie T.,"Valatie, NY",0,5,,2.0,2017-11-04,Saturday night you're busy l get it. We were seated in a little area with 7 booths. 3 other of the tables had their orders taken before ours was taken.

31,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",63,299,984.0,3.0,2017-12-07,"I'll admit it. I'm highly suggestible so when I heard Jay and Allyson of WNIC raving about Chili's nachos and fajitas on-air earlier on in the day, I knew that I had to make it there. Timing was perfect since I was doing a 'Target Run' nearby.  The tableside guac was substantial, two whole avocados mashed but chunky, the way I like it, with cilantro, diced red tomatoes, and onions. I asked the server to leave out the jalapeno disks so the end result was a bit flat until I added the salsa. The tostada chips were outstanding, extra thin, light, salty, and warm. They were fragile, to be sure, so scooping out the guacamole was a no go and instead, it was more about spooning it onto the chip. I also had the shrimp and steak fajitas combo that was more onions and peppers than anything else. As always, the portion was huge so there was more than enough for dinner the following evening. Service was friendly and relatively quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
