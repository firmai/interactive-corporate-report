Angela L.,Spanaway  WA,3,17,,10/14/2017,5.0,We had the best service from this young man named Nick. He looked like Kai from Vampire Diaries. So sweet and very attentive. Lots of ice in my tea. The boneless wings with sriracha dry rub are amazing. Oh and my fish and chips were awesome. Usually I eat the spaghetti because it is really good and I am a picky picky pasta eater  but I wanted to try something different and I was not disappointed. The fried fish rocked. The clam chowder is pretty good too. I love their fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea. I wish we had had Nick the next time we came in. My husband felt we should sit in the bar. Never again. Soup without crackers  fish and chips no ketchup. Iced tea no ice. We rarely saw the server I was so disappointed in her. Service for me is one of my highest expectations. So when it is not up to par I am very sad. The food was wonderful as usual though. We will continue to dine here and I highly recommend this restaurant. I have two suggestions make sure that Ice tea has lots of ice and the booths need to be made wider. I am a fat girl and could not sit in a booth  not enough room.
Kelly S.,Wenatchee  WA,107,12,13,9/12/2017,5.0,"Ordered: Root beer glazed wings  prime rib dip  and Oreo pazookiPositives: service was awesome! Our waitress was very attentive even with it being extremely busy. The manager was even out helping!! The wings are to die for; I\'m usually drawn to buffalo wings but these are some of the best wings I\'ve ever had. I was torn between my ""go-to"" menu item (parmesan crusted chicken) and trying the turkey dip. The waitress suggested the prime rib dip instead. WOW! So glad she did!!! As always  the pazooki was delicious  definitely my favorite.Negatives: the parking is shared with four other major restaurants so can be a little tough. The hostess that took our names walking in and then later sat us looked/acted as though she would rather be cleaning gum from under park benches. I don\'t like to put people down but compared to the rest of experience  her attitude really stuck out. Maybe she was having a bad day but it was really off putting. I really can\'t think of anything negative besides those two things  our whole meal from walking in to leaving was fabulous!"
Carrie T.,Boise  ID,34,43,,8/28/2017,2.0,We had a party of 8 stop in for drinks and apps around 3:45 on a Saturday afternoon. As it was in between lunch and dinner  it was pretty empty except for the bar. It took several minutes to be seated  and then another 20 minutes for any kind of service  which was rather disappointing. Our server stopped by after we sat looking at the menu for 15 minutes to notify us she had a couple of other tables and would be back later. Huh? She then took her time closing out the other customers before stopping by to grab our drink order. Once the drinks came  they were all very good. They have several flavors of sparkling water and a great beer/alcohol selection. The appetizers were typical - several orders of mozza sticks  spinach & artichoke dip  and garlic Parmesan knots. Overall  a pretty meh experience. I would recommend bar seating in the future.
Ana G.,Puyallup  WA,0,5,1,11/27/2017,3.0,Bj's makes my favorite salad anywhere: roasted Brussels sprout and kale salad with blackened salmon. Absolutely delicious. The salmon is always excellent and not overdone. Unfortunately  we don't eat here that often because the service is so inconsistent. Tonight  they forgot our salad dressing and service was slow. We might have had a second round of drinks but we were never asked. Too bad for a restaurant with decent food in Puyallup.
Joe R.,Bellevue  WA,76,154,30,6/19/2017,4.0,Expect: This was my first time at this location and it wasn't too bad! We called to make a big reservation which had to be confirmed through the manager (which took a little while...). But our server was awesome and the food was pretty good! I can definitely say that we will be coming back sooner or later. Service: 5Cleanliness: 5Quality of food: 4Quality of drinks: 4Tip: BJ's are typically busy; I would advise a reservation.
Trista H.,Everett  WA,35,368,2634,10/2/2016,3.0,A group of four stopped in here for a brew and lite bite before checking into our hotel room.Free parking can be found in the parking lot. Discover is an accepted form of payment. Tabs were easily split.BJ's reminded me of so many other sports bars/burger joints: Bob's  Boston's  Buffalo Wild Wings  etc... The decor is spacious and modern. The beer and wine menu is extensive and takes some time to peruse. With that being said  it would be helpful if the servers gave the patrons a couple of minutes to browse the vast selections rather than hover around waiting for an order to be placed.My wife and I chose a couple of pounders of Oasis Amber for $6.25 each. A bit high-priced to me.We shared the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer for $11.25. Our server stated these egg rolls were on the spicy side  which was incorrect. Sweet chili dipping sauce does not constitute spicy. The egg rolls were packed with fresh avocado and were a bit flavorless and extremely rich. Poor choice on our end.Our server was pushy in the beginning then became very scarce once our orders were served. We actually had to request our second beers from another server.Thank you BJ's for whetting our whistle while we were waiting for our hotel room.
Sabrina J.,Puyallup  WA,102,25,7,10/28/2017,4.0,I absolutely love this place. I really enjoy the happy hour menu. I've come here for meetings  family celebrations and just dinner with my husband. They have great beer on tap md delicious salads! I would give it a 5 but the employees sometimes seem like they hate their lives...
Jennifer L.,Arlington  WA,0,41,49,8/16/2017,3.0,Not only do I base my reviews on food  I do it for customer service as well...food was decent and customer service wasn't that great. My friend and I were here for lunch and it wasn't busy. From the moment we sat down we waited 10 min before we got our water (we know exact time  cause we posted a story to IG  so this is how we kept track of time). Our wings came out 31 minutes after being seated. We got lemon pepper and spicy buffalo  which were both pretty good. I liked the lemon pepper better. After that the salads we got came out 10 min later. We were wondering what took so long  by I guess there was no cook and I overheard the server saying there was a manager helping out. I got the Cobb salad which was sooo good and hearty! My friend got the seared ahi salad which was delicious. Huge portions and I recommend sharing the salad.
Faith F.,Tacoma  WA,0,1,1,8/25/2017,3.0,My husband and I usually come here at least twice a month. It's usually pretty good and we've started ordering takeout here. However when we got home our pizookie was a squished mess that didn't even fill half the bowl it was in. Kind of a disappointment.
Larry K.,Federal Way  WA,27,1,2,7/9/2017,4.0,This was a cool place with great service I enjoyed the steak and potatoes I had while my girlfriend enjoyed her cheese and ham grilled sandwich the only problem we ran into is that there was flies on the patio outside I would recommend this restaurant to some of my Amigos
Tamara H.,Tacoma  WA,30,2,2,2/20/2017,2.0,Don't wear high heels in the Puyallup location I have SLIPPED ON THEIR FLOOR EVERY TIME I HAVE COME HERE. I wonder how many women have and didnt catch themselves in time. Lawsuits waiting to happen
Kristina G.,Enumclaw  WA,17,43,180,2/18/2017,4.0,Really enjoyed coming here- had really good food and a great waitress through a couple of hiccups. Strongly represent the mashed potatoes and Parmesan crusted chicken and the wedge salad. Also the Red ale was very drinkable and smooth! We went on Saturday evening for dinner where the wait for a table neared a half hour. It seemed like multiple occasions occurred where parties didn't hear their names being called out despite the waitstaff yelling out a couple of times. Once we were seated  we got our drinks and looked through the massive menu. Had a small issues with a steak that was over cooked but our waitress and the manager were incredibly supportive.
Colleen I.,Tacoma  WA,100,3,,3/26/2017,5.0,To MY favorite bartender Thank you !If you like whiskey  then you will have to know that he makes the BEST manhattans. Tell him Colleen sent you.
Mark V.,Graham  WA,0,26,3,8/3/2017,3.0,I would give it a flavorless one star  but my wife would say it is a five.  I find it too corporate  too formula and the beer too hoppy.  My wife likes the salads and healthy options.
Ryan C.,Puyallup  WA,121,137,4,4/21/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,We've been back once since our bad experience. Things were a little better this time  but service was still slow and some what inattentive. Food was correct  and good this time though so thats good. Still not sure how often we'll be back because there are so many other options in Puyallup  but I suppose we might try again.
Rachel D.,Tacoma  WA,34,22,1,4/15/2017,1.0,Service slow. Ordered a kale and Brussel sprout salad. Received mixed greens but not kale. It was a healthy salad but so much dressing. Ick! And as I got to end of salad   a hair! Gross
Brent T.,WA  WA,1,6,8,2/14/2017,5.0,I have been to BJ's multiple times. Every time I have gone  the food and beer have been great. Last night  I went with a group of 4 adults and two kids. We were quickly seated and the kids (4 year old and almost 2 year old) were given a cup of mixed fruit and a folded breadstick.The avocado egg rolls were a great appetizer. My entree was the Ahi Salad  which was fantastic. The fish was seared (as Ahi should be) and came with wasabi. I also tried the Grilled California Club  which was good. They didn't skimp on the avocado and the bacon was perfectly cooked.As for beer: I recommend the BJ's Blonde or the Jeremiah Red.Service was great. Food came quickly and my water cup never went dry.
Michael C.,Windsor Locks  CT,153,1,,4/1/2017,1.0,Food came out twice cold and under cooked. Getting a waitress to refill your drink is like winning the jackpot.
Bruce W.,Puyallup  WA,0,48,,9/10/2017,1.0,I vowed never to return to this place  but my grand daughter wanted to go so she could try the new dessert  Churro Pizzookie. My previous reviews chided their poor service  and that has not been fixed. When we first arrived about 90% of the tables were empty. I asked for a table for four and the host said it would be about 5-minutes. Really  the place was empty. Our server was very nice  but I don't think this organization has the tools in place for good service. The food is generally OK  but something is always wrong. This time the asparagus was way overcooked and the table behind us also sent it back to the kitchen. The asparagus was obviously not right and should have never been brought to the table. The manager did address our concerns but continued to ask what was wrong with the asparagus. The wait between every step of the meal process was too long for this type of establishment. The new dessert  well the ice cream was good  but the Churros were not prepared properly  were chewy  and honestly tasted like they had just been thawed and dumped under the ice cream. At some level this restaurant (or maybe this chain) needs to find management that gives the employees the tools to run a better place. I think I'm done with BJ's Brewhouse.
Shania S.,Seattle  WA,34,4,2,6/11/2017,5.0,Tonight we decided to go out to Bj's and it was the best decision ever. Corinne was our sever and probably the best one we have ever had. She was very thorough and kind throughout our entire visit. She made sure we had everything we needed at all times. Both of our meals were cooked perfectly and we were both very satisfied. Corinne made us feel very welcome and appreciated. We will definitely drive down to this location to visit her when we can!
Garet K.,Sumner  WA,29,3,,5/13/2017,2.0,I have been here 3 times now and every time the service has been poor. The only reason we came a 3rd time is we received a gift card. Otherwise I would come anymore. The waiter pretty much leave you for long stretches of time.
Cassandra C.,SeaTac  WA,165,114,256,3/4/2016,3.0,I love the ambiance of all BJs restaurants. The one in Southcenter has a place in my heart because that's where I watched the NFC championship game against the 49ers. That is the year Seattle won the super bowl. Also Tacoma is where we found out the gender of our baby by the server putting a pink Splenda packet under our pazooki. Anyways! Enough about me. This visit was great except for the fact that they put dressing on my salad when I asked them not to. However I was so hungry I just ate it and the extra dressing on the side they gave me went unused. *shrug You lost a star guys but to be fair I only give 5* out to an establishment that went above and beyond. Everything else was great. We came on a Friday evening at about 6p. We were seated pretty much right away. A quick 10 minute wait was all. There are TVs perfectly placed so the entire restaurant has a view at their own seats.
Emily S.,Casper  WY,1,28,6,5/11/2017,5.0,This place is great! It is popular so it can get busy and sometimes there is a wait but it's worth it. The homemade cokes are amazing! And the pizza is the best thick crust pizza in town even though it is a chain. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone. Even health conscious or people who are into gluten free. I've never had bad service or a rude waiter. They also have some great lunch deals that they usually let you take advantage of any time of day. The pazookies are incredible! Probably my favorite dessert of all time is the cookies and cream pazookie. I've even gone here before just for dessert. If it is a weekend evening and you are in a hurry or really hungry I suggest calling ahead for a table. It'll save you probably 30+ min.
Alexa C.,Puyallup  WA,128,8,4,6/25/2016,2.0,I usually have a great experience there and I absolutely love the pizooki but the burger I got was no better than something off the dollar menu. The service was crappy and extremely slow and after showing the waiter my burger he just chuckled it off without even asking if I would like more tomato (see picture) overall it's extremely over priced for the off brand Cheesecake Factory it's pretending to be.
Smaly K.,Tacoma  WA,106,404,1490,11/29/2015,3.0,I guess they changed up the menu  because we didn't see a lot of the usual items  including the Cajun Pasta that my cousin and I always order. My cousin ordered the Jambalaya  which was a little too salty. I decided to try the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne  which was a new menu item. It was good  but didn't taste like it was worth $16. It tasted like your simple  basic pasta  the kind you can make at home with a jar of marinara sauce. For dessert  we shared a Chocolate Chunk Pizookie  which never seems to be disappointing. So good wasn't bad  but service wasn't the greatest. Our server was nice  but very quiet and not attentive.
Brian S.,Puyallup  WA,0,7,,4/19/2017,3.0,Good food and beer plan on waiting a while for a table during peak times. Parking sucks here you are lucky if you get a spot in the lot
Avniel Y.,Renton  WA,7,3,,3/7/2017,4.0,So many options! I love using the app to hold a seat  pre-order  and pay. Great place.
Frankie S.,Seattle  WA,1,13,9,9/11/2015,1.0,9/11/2015 Nasty Menu was all sticky. Absolutely no attention to details here. All brain dead employees are mostly concerned about trying to speak politely... They missed it all because it's a restaurant not a place for you to try and learn the English language  just worry about cleanliness and my food...08/16/2015 walked in at 7:04 pm ordered within 5 min... 7:57 pm still no dinner at my table for 2... This is by far one of the slowest BJ'S Restaurants I have been to on the west coast... it must be the hillbilly deluxe style in puyallup...? Yes all the other negative reviews are true... Usually dirty silverware  slow service  and my last time here. Red Robin and a dozen other places are all around within 2 minutes.Slowest Dine in place on earth and disorganized What a Joke For A Restaurant... They provide fast service to cops first for some reason when we were seated first and ordered first... Maybe these state patrol cops that dine here are over paid...
Ryan M.,South Hill  WA,22,1,,5/21/2017,1.0,"This might have been the worst dining experience I\'ve ever had. My son and I came in because we had a free appetizer coupon we wanted to use  on Sunday night around 6:15. The hosts were very friendly and brought us to a table immediately as the restraint was not very busy. The service  however  was atrocious. Our server  April  greeted us in a rude manner  she was definitely not happy to be there and it showed. We had to repeat our drink order because she said she  ""spaced out"". Then she offered the excuse that she had been there since 11:00 AM and was tired. I am a server myself and one thing you should never do is tell your guest you were spaced out when they were ordering  and that essentially you are too tired to do your job! I\'m sorry you were there so long  April  but were you getting paid that whole time? Yes! So do your job or find a different line of work! We ordered our appetizer and she asked us for our dinner order at the same time. Our dinner came out before our appetizer  and we didn\'t have silverware on the table so I asked for some utensils  as I had spaghetti and then April went to take another tables order before giving me silverware. The food was mostly forgettable. The spaghetti was mushy and the meatballs looked underdone. My sons grilled cheese sandwich looked as if it sat in the window for 10 minutes  it was hard and wholly unappealing. 10 or 15 minutes after our food was delivered our appetizer came out  and I declined as we were both finished eating. We asked for the bill and when she brought back my card  she had charged me for another tables bill  double what I should have been charged. She then never came back and we had to get a manager to fix the overcharge. The manager was apologetic and assured me the charge had been reversed and charged my card the correct amount. He told me to keep the free app card we had  which since our app came after the meal  I was going to do anyways. Overall this experience was terrible."
Jason A.,Puyallup  WA,6,50,1,6/9/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Usually pretty good food.Took away my chicken tacos which was my go to.Ordered bison burger. Burnt it and Hun was soggy at start. Amazing service though.Avo eggrolls a++++BHave a question or wish to follow up on my review ? Managers or owners : feel free to email me gymfitness253@outlook.com
J C.,Puyallup  WA,0,26,5,2/19/2017,4.0,Beer and food is great. Can be a bit pricey though. Not the best place for date night. It's hard to hear in there sometimes. Try the Tatonka Stout and Jeremiah Red.
Brian D.,Puyallup  WA,8,23,7,11/23/2016,3.0,Wife loves the place  me not so much. I just am not a fan of their menu or beers.
Katie G.,Puyallup  WA,11,29,8,5/26/2016,4.0,We went on a Wednesday night. Were sat pretty quick and our Server Jorge Z came over to get drinks going. He was super  duper attentive and friendly. Having worked in the restaurant world for 8+ yrs I don't praise servers often but he's the Best server in Puyallup that we've encountered so far. We'll be requesting his section from now on. He's THAT awesome. The burgers we delicious. The Pizookie is orgasmic. The beer is good but pricier than Red Robin across the way. Other wise the two are comparable in (burger) prices but you get a swankier feel and better burgers! This BJs was much better than the first one I went to in CA. Looking forward to returning.
Ian S.,Puyallup  WA,2,11,,4/23/2016,2.0,My roommate and myself both started out with the clam chowder. It was very bland and luke warm. We both agreed that it tasted like it came out of a can.For dinner I had the Brisket and Bacon burger. It was acceptable but very dry. My roommate had the same thing. He ordered his medium well and I ordered mine well done (I know well done burgers are not ideal but I get sick from anything less). The burger just did not have any (or very little) sauce and was very dry for both of us. It was also VERY salty and I love salty foods.I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the waitress was good and kept our drinks full. We should have just went to Red Robin in the same parking lot. We will not be back.
Bridget A.,Modesto  CA,162,25,15,5/8/2016,5.0,Bjs was my goto for an late afternoon beer when I lived in Cali. But Washington is so much better getting to leave with a groweler of their jerry burst was enough to make me never want to leave! Not to mention the coolest bar tenders! This will be my new spot in my new home!
Andrea S. M.,Ashford  WA,7,2,,1/18/2017,5.0,I just had dinner at this restaurant with my husband for the very first time. To put it simply  we are quite impressed. Sujenti was our server  and we really enjoyed conversing with her as well as her service. So the service was awesome  the food was delicious  the restaurant wasn't too loud  we didn't have to wait very long to be seated  and we will definitely go back!
Amanda O.,Spanaway  WA,14,1,,1/11/2017,5.0,This is definitely my favorite restaurant to visit. The service is fantastic and the people are all so kind. Not to mention the food is delicious. They've got the best mashed potatoes. It's a restaurant worth visiting. I've never had a bad experience and I always feel the desire to come back.
Carol H.,Puyallup  WA,6,116,363,4/9/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I'm updating my review since our last visit last summer wasn't up to par yet I failed to review it . That visit the service was the worst we'd had at any restaurant in years and the entree salad barely had anything but the greens plus got order mixed up when we finally did get served  ugh. So I'm happy to say yesterdays visit was a pleasant experience given it was celebrating my birthday. We ate in the enclosed outside area which was very nice on a beautiful day. We had two servers  obviously one in training and both were professional. We started off with an app. we'd never had before  the hot spinach dip w/ tortilla chips....really good! Chips hot and fresh and the dip was cheesy goodness with enough art/ spinach. Appetizers are a bit pricey  at 11.50 you'd think it might have shrimp or crab. It was a Friday at 2:00 so we were able to also choose from the weekday lunch specials. I had no clue they offer an UNLIMITED soup/salad for 8.99!! The cool thing is it's not just one type of salad and one or two soups....it's all 3 salads (caprese  ceasar  and blue ch. wedge) and for soups it's 5 offerings (clam chowder  cheesy broccoli  tomato bisque. Ale chili  and chicken tortilla). On the weekends you can do a soup/salad combo at the same price but it's one bowl/one salad not unlimited. It's fun to be able to be able to do a couple different combos before your stuffed to the gills! My first round was caprese' salad (fresh mozz/tomato with diced red on.  basil w/balsamic glaze) with broc/cheese soup. Both were really good  although my personal preference is the sliced larger mozz. over the tiny mozz. balls. The broc/cheese soup was super cheesy  like velveta soup with broccoli but I'm not complaining  lol good but really rich! I was getting full on my first round and it certainly wasn't due to the small light salad. My daughter had the chicken strips/fries and they let her order a side ceasar for only 1.50 more and it was a nice size! She was very happy with everything. My hubby had the california chicken club and it was impressive  nice amount of all the fixing's...bacon  avocado  tomato and of course chicken with a garlic aoli he enjoyed. His only mild complaint was the tarter sauce being on the sweet side. I went on to order a second round of soup/salad. This time I did the clam chowder and ceasar. I noticed this time the soup came in a cup instead of a bowl but that was fine as I knew I wouldn't likely finish even the cup. I must say it wasn't the superb chowder we've had in the past  the problem being the diced potatoes were still firm  eekkkk  disappointing only ate half. My ceasar for some reason was saturated in dressing. Now I like dressing to be on the generous side but this was so heavy the romaine was getting soggy  just way too much so much got left behind. I must mention the drinks. I started with a Ultimate Long Island Ice tea hoping for a little boozy kick  wrong..good but not potent like a good one should be. My daughter changed off between the flavored ice teas and lemonades which was a great deal for 3.25 being able to get refills. My hubby had a craft beer  the new peach one which was refreshing and only 3.95 on the lunch weekday special which ends at 3:00. I had a hefeweizen for my second drink which was really good too. We were all feeling pretty darn full an hour or so later. The servers were very attentive the entire meal and brought me a small complimentary pazookie with a scoop of ice cream to top things off. I had to take it home and enjoyed it later. Those darn cookies are sooooo rich and yummy  wow. Our bill for all this came to 67 bucks  not bad at all. Overall nice experience...the couple mishaps weren't enough to put a damper on the entire lunch. Luckily my first round of soup/salad was a hit.
Jessica T.,Occoquan  VA,47,20,2,3/15/2016,3.0,The food and service are just fine for a lunch. Dinner is another story. It is always a long wait to get anything. They have decent food and I LOVE their always crispy thin fries.
Rachelle S.,Kent  WA,0,3,,7/3/2017,5.0,Took my dad here for Father's day  we were able to find a booth in the bar right away! Our drinks took awhile but our waiter was super nice and a manager came over and gave my dad a coupon and a cool glass to take home! Some special they were doing for all the dads. Love their beer selection  would definitely come back!
Joshua S.,Tacoma  WA,0,13,,7/6/2016,4.0,We generally sit in the bar or in their indoor/outdoor seating. We've always gotten prompt service and cold beer.I wish their menu was laid out more simply and that they paired down their menu so it's not so unruly  but on the bright side there's definitely something in there you haven't tried yet.Good beer and great service. They're even great with kids and work hard to make things right when they make a small mistake.
Debbie L.,Olympia  WA,28,26,12,9/14/2016,2.0,It was noise end they should lower their prices even though the company was good it just wasn't enoungh
Jennifer P.,Puyallup  WA,77,6,,12/14/2016,1.0,When this restaurant first opened  it was great  large portions  great service. As time has gone on  the service is not so hot  and the food is smaller portions  and last time  it had dirty silverware  so bad  the restaurant starting using plastic! Unfortunate the manager blamed it on a new person who washes the dishes  we that couldn't be the case because there was food literally stuck to the forks  meaning faulty dishwasher  not a person!
Tres B.,Seattle  WA,736,1354,1242,3/15/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,In puyallup  this is a top flight restaurant. It looks beautiful and the service is generally quick.But the food is truly hit or miss. Soe  dishes are spectcular (stuffed mushrooms) while others are intolerably lame (most appetizers) . Also  the beers  which is their calling card  are sub par. That's a bit astonishing.
Blyth D.,Federal Way  WA,0,5,8,4/9/2017,2.0,I have never been to BJ's before. I probably won't be back. The staffs uniforms were dirty (front of the house staff should not be THAT dirty) and the host that sat us looked unkempt and not professional. We sat next to a window that had a really dirty window sill  almost like they never cleaned it. Regardless  I had high hopes because they're Ahi poke and calamari apps were delicious. I had the kale and roasted brussel sprouts salad with salmon. The salad lacked an identity and there was so much going on with the stuff inside the salad  but I will say that the salmon was cooked to perfection. My brother's dish was mediocre but tasty. My sister got the Peruvian quinoa dish which was underwhelming and under seasoned; but like mine  her salmon was cooked well. (if I could I would give the fish station 5 stars.) All of the plates came out dirty and my sister was given a glass with old lipstick marks on it... (she was drinking out of a straw). Now  I don't know that ALL BJ's locations are like this  but I wouldn't recommend the one on South Hill.
Darian B.,Puyallup  WA,0,27,12,3/25/2016,1.0,God awful service  or lack there of. Have been here a few times (not my vote)  and each time the food has just been terrible and the beers I want are always out. The location near Tacoma mall was entirely different. Fast and friendly service  and shockingly delicious food.
Bill G.,Bonney Lake  WA,0,9,,4/21/2017,2.0,My wife and I eat at BJ's twice a month and this particular experience was disappointing. Vegetable under cooked  steak Luke warm and fries cold. I expect more for a $81 tab
Veronica M.,Graham  WA,7,34,17,7/31/2016,3.0,Pizza is great and the service is always nice. But it's time to talk Pizookies- why do they taste like they were made in an easy bake oven??
AngryDiver M.,Bonney Lake  WA,2,8,13,10/24/2015,1.0,Service was slow  food ordered was screwed up  after being comped for a free appey we were double charged. Noticed lots of other patrons waiting long periods for food. Won't be returning.
Stephanie V.,Bonney Lake  WA,0,10,,10/8/2015,1.0,Whenever we go to this location we have a pretty frustrating experience. The wait is ridiculous  like others have said WITH a call ahead we are told 15 min and end up waiting 25-30. Not sure what the point of a call ahead is. It took quite a while to get our drinks but once that happened everything came out pretty quick because we ordered everything (drinks an appetizer and dinner) all at once. It took a while for us to get our dessert and the check wasn't correct and it took 15 minutes just to get the check correct. They didn't know how to get $25 off from their own point rewards program. Face palm. Anyways we gave this place a second shot and it's just not worth the 2.5 hour trip. We even had three kids with us. Thank goodness they were good. Last time we came we sat in the bar and barely saw our waitress and everything took forever  my food was gross  and the place wasn't even busy. I don't know what the issue is but I can guess it's they don't have enough people staffed because I barely see any worked buzzing around. Other locations do a much better job.
C M.,Auburn  WA,32,52,106,12/22/2015,5.0,Amazing! Our server Tony was attentive and authentic  he suggested delicious appetizers and was quick to refill our beverages. The meal was more than satisfying  it was a welcome relief from the bustle of holiday shopping. This B.J.s is much better than others I have visited. I would recommend this place to any who want a slightly pricier meal with superior service and impeccable taste. Thank you B.J.s!
Destiny P.,Shoreline  WA,65,19,8,8/31/2016,2.0,I've been to BJ's a couple of times now because there are only so many options being out in Puyallup for late night snackage. Each time has been mediocre at best...the food is ok  but in my opinion for the quality of it its over priced and nothing special. The customer service is REALLY hit and miss. There have been multiple times when I've gone in and the staff seemed like they just didn't want to be there [which I understand  I have days like that too  but being in the service industry you learn to fake it for your guests].
Kris F.,Puyallup  WA,88,3,,11/1/2015,1.0,My friends and I decided to go have brunch today and we decided to try BJs. That was the worst choice we ever could have made. There was no one in the restaurant which should have been our first clue but we took a seat in the bar anyway. It took almost 45 minutes for our 3 meals to come out even though there was NO ONE in there. We had to physically go to the bar ourselves to refill our water and to get our checks. The waitress was completely rude and they wonder why people hate going there! It's completely ridiculous how even after being open for awhile  this place still can't get their shit together. Honestly if I could have given this place no stars  I would have. If you want BJs Brewhouse  make the trip out to Tacoma or SouthCenter. You will be much happier at either location.
Carlos O.,Las Vegas  NV,0,33,,10/2/2016,5.0,BJs has always been great. They have a great menu with lots of selections. Kind of feels upscale without having to dress up. The only downside was the last time we were in there they had on the Husky game.
Greg C.,Puyallup  WA,12,52,22,7/13/2016,2.0,We live right around the corner so it's very convenient for us - and the food is pretty good  but we have literally never had good service from the staff here. Fool me once  shame on me.. Fool me 10 times  I'm really an idiot for continuing.
Tina M.,Puyallup  WA,17,18,12,7/21/2016,5.0,One of the best places to go for a date night or family. They're great and give me military families their discounts & managers are always friendly and willing to help to explain anything that comes up with your order staff is always friendly and helps with any needs that you might have. One of the best items on their menu is the twisted BLT salad  their burgers are always juicy & barbecue ribs are always flavorful.
Charles S.,Graham  WA,8,4,2,2/21/2016,2.0,Egg rolls were a joke for $11. Southwest salad got a double hit from the spice weasel today. Cooks and wait staff get a D today.
Nesh B.,Puyallup  WA,86,8,,9/4/2016,2.0,Great atmosphere. Great service. Great drinks. Um...... I ordered the deep dish ziti and my boyfriend ordered the jumbo spaghetti and meatballs. The cook is completely against seasoning pastas  it hurts my heart. Pastas need a little extra season for it to stick and I don't think the cook is aware of that because the pasta came out extra plain.
Heather L.,Puyallup  WA,141,23,29,9/2/2016,1.0,Always a crappy long ass wait to get your food....been here for 40 mins with a baby in tow....stillllll waiiitttinnngggggggggggg for a bowl of chili......
Paris C.,Puyallup  WA,20,54,77,10/27/2014,4.0,EDIT:( manager just came out to appologize for the pizza being so small  said it wasnt normally like that. He gave me a giftcard and told me to come back and try it again! Not sure if he saw my review or he realized how tiny it was but im greatful for the customer service and im changing the stars to 4/5 instead of 3)Very average food for an expencive price.Good thing is you can make their hand tossed pizzas vegan if you ask for no cheese and no butter on the crust.I got the vegetarian pizza and it was tiny tiny for 13 bucks. Flavors were OK but didnt fill me up at all. It reminded me of an appetizer. All of my omnivore friends rated their food as very average as well.Pasta dishes come with a ton of pasta. But pizza..... so small :c atleast adjust prices.Dont come an hour before close if you expect good service. Ours kinda sucked  she expressed annoyance of us. Like we were a bother.
Jazmine L.,Columbus  GA,0,17,17,11/11/2015,5.0,Well its veterans today so free is always good. The food was awesome after i finished my food i even helped my husband finish his regardless of the fact that i was full. I had the rootbeer babyback ribs with coleslaw. Those ribs was so tender they fell of the bone and everybit of the that flavor was on point. My husband had siracha  chicken  and bacon macaroni and cheese pasta. That was super delicious i would def. Recommend BJ's and I would gladly return anyday!
Michael H.,Puyallup  WA,2,158,255,10/19/2015,1.0,Nothing towards BJ'S  it's just that our night was ruined due to a lady blowing her nose at the table across from ours. Why do people think that blowing there nose at the table is acceptable? It's nasty  and no one wants to hear buggers being blown while eating. People  stop doing this!!!!
Joseph B.,Spanaway  WA,42,1,,2/6/2016,5.0,Our group of five was waited on by a wonderful young woman named Rose. She has been personable and fun  while also being very on point with our orders and drinks. A mistake happened with our pizza and Daniel  the manager  was very prompt. As people who've worked in food for years  we have been exceptionally impressed. Of course  the Pizza  burgers  beer  and mozzarella sticks were wonderful.
George N.,Graham  WA,17,3,,8/27/2015,1.0,*Won't make that mistake again.* So we decided to try out BJ's for my Birthday dinner. *Upon arrival they told us it was about a 15 minute wait not to bad for 6 pm. *We were seated at about 6:20*Took drink orders pretty quick drinks came about 10 minutes later not too bad. * Took our order about 15 minutes later in part because we weren't ready. *After about 20 minutes noticed it was quite cold with a arctic draft coming down the wall and onto our table. Mentioned it to the waitress who was quite nice. She said she would talk to a manager to see if anything could be done and never heard anything nor did the arctic draft from the AC stop or even slow down. *About 45 minutes into waiting for our food my children boy age 7 in shorts and T-shirt and girl 9 wearing a lite summer dress were both complaining they were freezing. My wife and I were also both cold by now. It is important to note I DO NOT as a rule ever get cold. *Finally about an hour after ordering  our food showed up kids first followed by my wife and I about 1 minute later. *My wife ordered the Mediteranian Chicken Taco which she said was very good. This may be the best bang for your buck here.* I at the waitress' recommendation ordered the Ribs which I chose to pair with the White Cheddar Mashed potatoes and the Clam Chowder. The clam chowder never came until my meal was delivered. We asked about it and it was promptly brought out and was told that This is unacceptable I will take care of it by someone whom I thought may have been a manager. I mistakenly understood that to be there would be some adjustment to out tab. NOT THE CASE. As for my meal the chowder was only okay definitely nothing special at all. The potatoes were clearly instant and where underwhelming. The ribs were only a minute or two from being completely overcooked. They were on the edge of being dry definitely not the moistness one would expect from good ribs. These ribs were okay tasting nothing special. Overall my meal was just short of completely disappointing. It took way too long to get a box for what was left of our food and the check. I definitely think they were understaffed. One of the servers dropped a plate on the floor near us  sauce was splattered everywhere when we left about 20 minutes later it still had not been cleaned up. It is unlikely we will return to the Puyallup BJ's.
V C.,Puyallup  WA,0,1,,1/31/2017,1.0,My son and I decided to have dinner at BJ's on Southhill we were seated nobody showed up everybody else around us was served the people in front of us behind us but not us is this OK that a black woman and a white child are not served is BJ's now only serving white people I thought those days were long behind us I guess not!!!
Kim h.,Puyallup  WA,22,17,15,5/20/2016,2.0,My husband and I have eaten here many times and had consistently good food and service. Today we ate with our son and daughter.  Our food was mostly cold and not that tasty. The service was less than desireable. Our dirty dishes sat in front of us for 30 minutes. Really a disappointing visit.
Joel R.,Spanaway  WA,121,127,28,5/22/2015,5.0,Ok here we go. I had to really think about this. To start the hostess team was really great and had wonderful customer service. It didnt make sense that there was like 8 empty tables and there was still a 15 min wait but it was friday. The food was great though. I got the california burger and my wife got the cajun pasta and it was actually pretty good. My only comment would be that it was pretty chotatic with the staff and it wasnt very organized. But you won me over with the food and your girls in front.
Nataly B.,Seattle  WA,1,29,2,3/5/2016,1.0,After the movies me and the family came in for a late dinner about 9:00. I've ate here many times  and today I have never seen the women's restrooms so filthy! Toilet paper roll stretch out in the stalls  no napkins in each slots. No soap are you kidding me? I've seen Mc Donald's bathroom cleaner than this. Is it because it's late in the day? Im not sure but a clean bathroom is important to have especially a establishment like BJ's.
Christi H.,Seattle  WA,20,53,27,6/12/2015,4.0,How long has Puyallup needed this?! An upscale casual dining experience. Great ales  good happy hour specials ($5 lemon drops) food is good. This is not slammed out in a rush so expect a little wait. Ahi tuna is amazing along with Fish and chips. My husband thought they were the best he had anywhere!
Sara T.,Muskegon  MI,25,144,1072,6/26/2014,5.0,"DO NOT expect the pizza you see in the picture. I can not stress this enough: DO NOT expect your pizza to look like the one in the picture. It is NOT a deep dish pizza  and definitely not as ""deep"" as in the picture. It\'s still a good pizza  just not what I was expecting. So we continue our search for deep dish - We\'re from Michigan and were big fans of Chicago Pizza. There\'s just not anything close here.Anyway...Moving on.Even though it\'s not a true deep dish pizza  I\'m still VERY surprised that this place is rated so low! This has actually become one of our favorite places to go out to eat and have a couple of drinks. The pizza may not be a Chicago pizza  but it\'s still a darn good pizza.We\'ve been here probably 5-6 times and have never had bad service. (HUGE shoutout to our awesome waitresses: Samantha W  Elsy P  Rebecca P!). We don\'t go in expecting service to be quick - It\'s a big place  is busy  and it\'s not someplace where you\'re going to get your food in ten minutes.The last time we went  the boyfriend got a burger instead of pizza and it was okay - I\'m going to stick with pizza though. They tried to put ""grill marks"" on the burger and it ended up being medium on the inside (how he likes it) but with a burnt outside (NOT how he likes it). It wasn\'t bad  but I don\'t think we\'ll be getting it again.The drinks...Ohhhhhhhhhhhh the drinks. :) I\'m a big fan of the watermelon mojito but I also recently tried the Pomegrante Paradise (so good!) and our new favorite drink is the Irish Root Beer: Bailys  Jameson  and root beer. This tastes like root beer and cream soda had a baby and it\'s beautiful. Don\'t be fooled - There\'s a LOT of alcohol in it but it doesn\'t taste like it. We will go back again JUST for this drink...Or eight. :)Again  pretty surprised at the low reviews  but we like it."
Joe A.,Puyallup  WA,70,62,123,5/23/2014,4.0,I guess my BJs story begins in Summer 2012  in Carlsbad  California. After spending an amazing day at Del Mar Beach  we discovered an awesome  California home  restaurant called BJs. We were astonished by the awesome food and how we wished they had one back home in Western Washington. A year or so after that  we finally moseyed our way out to Tacoma for my birthday celebration at the much anticipated BJs Tacoma. And let me say  I was thoroughly embarrassed and mortified at the terrible experience we had there to the point of me losing their business forever.So  I guess I was pretty skeptical about eating there tonight  especially since the mixed reviews seem limitless.Earlier tonight  we walked in to a great service and atmosphere and literally no wait to be seated which was a fantastic upgrade from their crappy Tacoma location. All of waitresses were very kind and courteous.I started with the appetizer of chicken wings which were really good :) And believe me  I KNOW chicken wings! Then for my entree  I got a deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage! It was delishhhhh. And then to end things off  I got the new salted caramel pizzookie and that  my friends  will hit every single sweet tooth in your body :)Again  the atmosphere and service was superb which is huge upgrade from Tacoma.My one and only con  is that it was a tad slow  but that's all.Overall  I found a new respect and love for this franchise. Love it!! Totally recommend!!Oh and I dunno why but the pics below are from my accidentally deleted review of their Tacoma location and I don't know why they showed up here :/
Andrei M.,Seaside  OR,0,7,,12/26/2016,1.0,"I came here with a small party of four and we were told the day staff was ""switching out"" for the night staff and that the wait time would be longer. I was given an estimated wait time of approximately 20 minutes. Somewhere around 40 minutes later we were still waiting and watching as the hostess called out for the same three parties. None of these people were even in or around the restaurant and never came to the hostess podium. (One of them was a party of 9! They could have seated a third of the people crammed into the lobby if they\'d have moved on.) As more and more guests arrived the hostess continued to offer the same poorly crafted excuse that there was a staffing switch (that apparently lasts for nearly an hour) and the wait time was about 20 minutes. She still called out for the same 3 parties. This was exacerbated by the fact that the ""waiting area"" consists of two tiny benches filled with other people already waiting  so my family was forced to stand directly in front of the hostess station  near the drafty rotary door  in everybody\'s way.The hostess never smiled  clearly didn\'t want to be at work  and was short and unconcerned with our and others\' wait time and inquiries. She didn\'t even respond to my wife\'s questions other than to raise her eyebrows. That said  with such little faith in the way this place treats its prospective guests  we decided we would be far better served else ware  where the business actually appreciated our patronage. The staff at this facility during our visit seemed to be not only unprofessional  but blatantly disrespectful to their customers and showed absolutely no signs of caring or having any interest in good service. Everyone has long and/or bad days at work  but thats never been an acceptable excuse where I\'ve worked. What pushed me over the line and ultimately caused me to leave this blunt and painfully honest review (I\'m not this hard on folks if I see they\'re trying) and vow never to come back to this place or recommend it again was the fact that even our children recognized how rude the portly and ill-tempered hostess was and asked why she purposefully ignored their mother  who had been very polite to the hostess and stood patiently at her podium for almost a full minute awaiting a response before I told her we were leaving. There are no excuses for that kind of behavior. My advice is to avoid this terribly managed place at all costs. Don\'t subject your family to such an apathetic group of disgruntled employees. Clearly the people that work here don\'t want to  and at least during our visit they weren\'t even trying to hide that fact."
Moda L.,Tacoma  WA,0,3,,3/12/2016,2.0,This was our second and will be the last dining experience here. Tonight we had a party of 18. Being a Saturday it was busy. From the time we began to place food orders to the arrival of all 18 meals was around 45 min. Focusing only on our family  the food was average.One order was the $12.95 portabello mushroom burger that was cooked nicely done. Fries were average at best. The Garlic Chicken Pesto pizza $15.75 was a bit smaller than expected. For some unknown reason  the shape resembled an eye or a fish rather than round or square. Some of the edges were burnt to a crisp. Flavor was good yet seemed to be lacking the main and therefore the reason it was ordered...Garlic. The garlic flavor was weak  undetectable.Another order was to be gluten and dairy free including sauces  meats  toppings  etc. Desiring to eat something other than salad this was ordered piecemeal. This special request was repeated to the server at least twice  and she acknowledged each time. Beforehand research was done reading the tiny online food sensitivity menu. It would have been useful to be offered a separate menu for food sensitivities during ordering  yet that was not an option we were told about. So with limited options from the main menu  a separate plate was prepared with a half cup broccoli  and two or three deli thin slices of ham. Too bad the ham was very salty and not eaten. Then on this order the kitchen goofed and added someone else's asparagus with butter (dairy) onto the no gluten no dairy plate. The server returned the order to the kitchen returning the plate with removed spears leaving a noticeable gap between the broccoli and deli ham. We did not expect the lemonade to be so sugary  so requested extra water. The waters did take some time to get refilled  and my original lemon had been squeezed dry three glasses ago. Didn't want to make a stink about it as our busy server Hailey M. had her hands full. Overall our party had a nice time chatting. Yet the overall visit left a bit to be desired. Next year's yearly gathering will be held elsewhere.
David W.,Tacoma  WA,0,2,,6/21/2016,3.0,My boys took me out for Father's Day. We ended up at bj's. No wait. Service was decent and the food came to us relatively fast. I had fish and chips and my boys had hamburgers. I enjoyed my fish and chips. Was it the best  no but was edible and the boys enjoyed their hamburgers. The bill came and wasn't bad. Would I go back? Yes. But not my favorite place I ever went. But for the price you can't beat a good sit down meal and plenty of tv's to watch sports.
Tony H.,Olympia  WA,0,9,,11/3/2016,2.0,Tried to seat us in the patio area  which was not very inviting. No one else was out there and it felt like a school cafeteria setting. We decided to sit inside. The atmosphere seemed kind of impersonal  like they really didn't care whether we were there or not. The food was okay  but it didn't make us want to go back for more. Next time we're in Puyallup  we'll probably choose another restaurant for lunch.
Turtle Mountain C.,Seattle  WA,0,41,3,8/10/2015,3.0,Went there for lunch Saturday at 12:15. They were not busy but lunch took forever. Especially considering I ordered a salad and my daughter ordered Clam Chowder. This has happened at this location before to us. They need to take lessons frokm Tukwila. They are much quicker.Jerimiah did a great job on our service. Very polite!
Nayoung K.,Auburn  WA,308,35,37,6/11/2015,3.0,Very busy restaurant for sure. Great looking restaurant inside and out. However with the food  it's either a really good hit  or a really good miss. Most appetizers are very small in portion  but no where near inexpensive. The appetizers cost just as much as a regular entre!
Meagan K.,Graham  WA,0,10,16,3/27/2014,5.0,My fianc and I have been here twice now  first time we ordered pizza - might I say the most delicious pizza I've had in years! The second time we both ordered burgers which were also amazing. I'm not sure if they have new bar staff  but they aren't consistent with the flavors. Don't get me wrong they still taste good  but I ordered a hurricane and it came out blue! Their drinks are a bit pricey compared to other restaurants of the same nature  but they actually put a fair amount of alcohol in them. So overall this is my favorite place in the area right now!
Chelsea W.,Puyallup  WA,0,15,,1/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I'm so mad at this place! We sat and waited for over an hour  to find out we had been paged 20 minutes ago  but the pagers are broken!!!! And the service wasn't even much better! Horrible experience
N L.,Tacoma  WA,0,13,3,11/18/2016,2.0,I've never had a problem with dining in the restaurant  but half my order was missing from curbside pick up. And they didn't even start my order until the scheduled pick up time.
Meghan M.,Buckley  WA,18,5,4,11/5/2015,1.0,This was my first time at this restaurant and I don't think I will be returning. I had their queso siracha dip and their chicken  bacon  siracha Mac n cheese. I guess I had a theme going. The dip was ok but if you are a siracha enthusiast you will probably find this lacking. Then the Mac came. Penne pasta to give it that pretentious air  no siracha at all  some sort of yellow oily liquid that barely kept the dish from being completely dry and bland chicken  broccoli and bacon. So what does this intrepid siracha loving preggo do? Ask our very nice server for a bottle of siracha  dump my left over queso on my plate and finally get what I was looking for. Kinda. I'll go back but only if I get to supervise in the kitchen.
Justin Z.,Bonney Lake  WA,0,4,,10/27/2015,4.0,I tried this place the other night and it was pretty good  I had the calamari app and it was cooked perfectly. I can't tell you how many time I have gotten calamari at a bar at it was rubber so that was a good start. I then ordered the bison burger  it was a little pink so if you have a weak stomach you might want to stay away from this one. It was really good tho  I give this place a solid 4 stars.
Dave H.,Puyallup  WA,3,20,3,4/7/2016,3.0,We've been to this location several times and we will probably be back but I hope they can improve on their product because there always has been 1 or 2 things not up to par on each visit. Today we had excellent service from the host and our server Leslie but the burgers bun was rock hard and there's no reason that should of been sent out by the kitchen. The other food was very good  my wife had spaghetti and meat balls which was excellent. They always make things right and hopefully things will improve. We will be back and update Yelp.
Richard H.,Graham  WA,323,1196,2682,12/24/2013,1.0,Sorry  but wasn't impressed with this place last time I went here (December 18th)  But will probably go back and give them another try. with the Deep Dish Pizza- The works minus mushrroms and Olives plus Pineapple and Red Onions  my wife went with the Bison Burger and since my Birthday was near  got the Pizookie which was REAL good. For drinks  I went with a Blonde first  then their Harvest Hefeweizen- both were real good. The server was real nice and real good as well.This is our second time here  last time I remember getting a Calzone and I wasnt to impressed with it as I had better Calzones elsewhere. (I felt it should of had more toppings in it)
Terry K.,Puyallup  WA,0,6,,5/1/2016,1.0,Three strikes you're out. All three visits were the same. Slow   inattentive service  horrible greasy fast food quality food that's seriously over priced  and their home brewed beer sucks! No need to ever return  shame on me for giving BJ'S this many chances ...
Taylor T.,Southwest Portland  Portland  OR,2,5,1,3/4/2016,2.0,Just about as I expected along with the bartender that would not shut up. He kept talking and complaining about the bus boys. More annoying than unprofessional  but nevertheless annoying. Food was mediocre.
Worldly F.,Seattle  WA,2,22,5,4/16/2015,2.0,Great service  bland food. Despite the huge menu  BJ's proved to be lacking what it needed for a repeat visit. We shared the watermelon salad which was delicious! I wish I would have ordered 3 of those. 20 min wait for food. The bf ordered a the california burger  I did the maui porkchop. Mediocre at best. Lacking flavor in both dishes. The white chedder mashed potatoes were tasty but super dry. They make their own soda  root beer and beer. Our bill was about 50$for 2 ppl. Our waitress was friendly and we never needed to ask for anything.
Leslie P.,Puyallup  WA,34,78,20,12/20/2015,3.0,Had our company Christmas party here last nightOrdered the seared ahi salad  beware menu picture is NOT what they serve you. So you will have to ask for them to serve you a proper serving of Ahi as well as the dressing on the side as ordered  Also the baked ziti  servings vary some are half of the full picture again on the menu  and served varied portions to the same table. This is a kitchen training problem.Some Servers are indifferent. Pardon me that if you serve me a plate that is not what I ordered your answer should not be  I am not your waitress. This only served to solidify you are not a server in a service industry and you have just alienated a customer by putting the burden of finding our waitress for a 20+ person party on the customer. I did not hear 1 rave on any meal served. BJs insert any excuse here________.The bread served with the baked ziti I am told was blah hard terrible  and yes my salad was finally fixed well into the meal. Have to say very disappointed  will not return. 3 stars is for its a large place with sports on TV's. But the other choices that surround around here are better. Olive Garden  Red Robin  and Famous Daves  numerous Great Thai food places  I think that if you are a big place like they are you should be properly staffed for your reservations  but who am I kidding I am not a restaurant manager.Well I did not choose this place but I went in open minded. But I think that you've succeeded in 10-15 people not returning and not providing good reviews of the service and food. Do the math  a large amount of money was spent on this party to be this disappointed.I wish we had read the reviews before coming because it is obvious everything I've noted here has been listed previously. Bad service  dirty silverware  not good food. Bam. Spend your money and time elsewhere.
Jhoana R.,Honolulu  HI,31,46,97,4/5/2015,3.0,My husband and I love bjs we've been to the ones in San Diego and the ones in San Antonio and this location is exactly like the rest of them nice service clean bathrooms great food! I always get the mushroom pizza and my hubby loves their shrimp scampi
Jessica M.,Renton  WA,122,3,1,4/13/2016,5.0,I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here this evening. The waiter  Nicholas  was incredibly patient with my colleagues and I when we were deciding on what to eat. He checked in on us a few times during our meal to make sure everything was tasting great from start to finish. Thank you for your patience and kindness  Nicholas!
Koji B.,Seattle  WA,3,40,61,3/18/2015,3.0,The deep dish pizza that I had was the supreme. All the ingredients were fresh which was great but the pizza lacked sauce it was very dry making it hard to eat. I asked the waitress to bring some marinara on the side because it was dry. She ended bringing a thimble full. Their IPA was good and the service was friendly.
Heather L.,Saint Robert  MO,8,4,6,3/29/2015,4.0,Great service  great food  great beer options. Perfect American spot. Had light menu options.
Keith K.,Puyallup  WA,3,298,5,7/15/2016,3.0,"Just OK....The prices are on the high side for what you get. Be careful to not mention if you really like a menu item because they tend to remove those quickly for some reason. We learned this after having our third ""favorite"" item removed from the menu. The service is average--nothing really to complain or brag about. But they do have fresh-brewed ice tea. However  now that I complimented it they may remove it form their menu..."
Zelda Z.,Olympia  WA,101,195,425,1/10/2014,4.0,I love going to BJ's. I typically visit the Tacoma location  but I was anxious to see how the newest location measured up. The layout is very similar to Tacoma  although there are a few distinct differences in the dcor. It seems like the Puyallup location is a little more dim than the Tacoma location  and I really like that about the restaurant. It creates a certain ambience. As with all BJ's location  there is a separate bar area with plenty of seating or plenty of tables and booths in the spacious dining room. If you want to watch the game on television  I recommend sitting at the bar for the best view. They even have free Wi-Fi.No matter when I go  there is always a good crowd at BJ's. They have a huge menu with pizza  appetizers  salads  burgers  steak  chicken  desserts  and not to mention all of their specialty beer/ale. The pricing is very reasonable  and they offer a discount for military service members. There is also a rewards program called Premier Rewards which will allow you to accumulate points that can be redeemed for food and beverages. They also recently launched a mobile app that can be downloaded and customers can place dine-in orders in advance of arriving at the restaurant  access a preferred waitlist and view wait times  and even pay the bill directly from the phone.I've always had good service at BJ's  and today was no exception. Great food  fun atmosphere  reasonable prices  good service  and a rewards program...what more could you ask for?
R M.,Brea  CA,2,42,22,4/21/2015,1.0,Poorly managed Resturant.Bar drink service was fastUnderstaffedOne busser for entire main dining room.Food from kitchen very slow.Soup Luke warm  delivered slowNeed runner for kitchenNoticed greeter/receptionist delivering desserts and filling watersPeople waiting to be seated and tables not bussed How's that pizza? Asked by mgr?Observed manager having to comp two dessertsObserved wait staff having to apologize twice to different tables.Get your act together BJ s. Get the right management and train your staff. I will not be back to this location.
Alekkz H.,Seattle  WA,494,554,1025,5/20/2013,4.0,"I think I like the Tacoma BJ\'s better but this one\'s alright  only because it\'s closer to home.I didn\'t even go to BJ\'s ever in my life until this year actually. I am sad I didn\'t discover it sooner! Now  what I really like about this place is their cocktail drinks! Yumm much? I had some kind of berry mojito awhile back  ordered a strawberry splash [I think it was called] recently with another side of Raspberry Lemon Drop.The Strawberry Splash was amazingly sweet  definitely was in the mood for a blended alcoholic beverage but the lemondrop was ehh... too hard on the taste.I also ordered a ""half"" order of boneless wings (Which is great because I don\'t want the whole 10 pcs by myself!Sitting at the bar is fun [just turned 21 this year]. By myself  not so much maybe but... I think the bar is an okay place for me to sit around when I feel like being alone rather than occupying a huge booth all to myself... catching peoples\' attentions thinking  ""She\'s by herself...""Definitely will be stopping by once in awhile after work for a drink or two.Oh I forgot  I was so caught up in my memories of sipping delicious cocktails  the service... was a 2-3 stars worth. The guy who eventually attended to me was super nice and friendly... but it took at least 10 minutes of me sitting there looking like an idiot until someone came to take my order!!Other than that  things were alright."
Sarawr O.,Post Falls  ID,17,59,19,1/21/2015,3.0,I enjoyed our date night here!THIS was the deep dish pizza we'd been looking for.Their beer is good- I loved the Jeremiah Red. They offer cute little half pints  which is so great- that way you can sample different beers but have more than a little shot sample.Buffalo wings were nice and spicy.We got a little 5-meat deep dish pizza and we were SO SAD that we hadn't gone here for Alex's birthday dinner instead of freaking lame Farelli's.Alex said the deep dish crust might have been the same as pizza huts frozen crust.. which is fine  since he loves it. I hope it's not but with the right amount of gourmet toppings  I don't care too much.We will be back to try it again!
Randy P.,Puyallup  WA,16,3,,10/10/2015,2.0,The service is really slow. We came with a group (10) for a birthday party and they said we would have a table at 6pm. At 630 we are still waiting and they are like oh we forgot about you and it will be another 15 to 20 minutes. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Russ A.,Seattle  WA,0,7,1,2/23/2016,2.0,I like BJ's menu and atmosphere in general. My experience at this location on not a busy Friday night(40% of capacity) was super slow service and lack of concern about it. I had friends in a party of 8  and another in a party of 6 that had the same experience. An hour wait for food without service. No Bueno.
Kenneth D.,Seattle  WA,11,5,7,1/17/2015,4.0,Great place for good food. Perfect for any occasion. A bit pricey but we'll worth it's taste
Kris H.,Puyallup  WA,92,41,18,12/3/2015,4.0,I came here for the beer! They have their own brands of cider that I could drink all night  and it's on tap. I haven't been able to find better in Washington to be honest! I will always come back for this!
Ky J.,Puyallup  WA,0,18,3,7/12/2014,5.0,Sat in the bar tonight with a group of friends after we finished our shifts at work. Our server was attentive but not too overbearing at all. Everything came out great despite a small mis communication with our dessert  which our server fixed right away (we didn't care at all  weren't in any rush). My friends and I are all in the industry and definitely appreciate when we can go to another establishment and receive great service. Wish I could remember her name (tall  slender blonde) Will definitely continue to come back!
Discerning Z.,Tacoma  WA,34,41,6,7/9/2014,2.0,"Having had their endless salad and soup lunch special before  my daughter and I decided to stop here for lunch earlier this week. Service was OK  though a bit slow for a quiet Monday at noon. She went for the stuffed mushroom appetizer (OK  though over $8 for 8 small-ish stuffed mushrooms is a bit pricey) and Tuscan chicken (too salty) and I again went for the soup and salad. The chili was good - made with their beer and topped with sour cream and green onions - but my salad contained not only plastic wrap from the salad dressing but also the dirty stub of the lettuce plant - ick! I complained to the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen. When she returned  she asked if I wanted something else instead - I said no  since the literal garbage in my salad had rather affected my appetite  but that I didn\'t feel I should pay for it. ""Oh no "" she replied  ""the manager took care of that."" When my bill arrived  I was surprised to find that the manager had given me a 50% discount on my lunch - $3.50 off for the salad. I had expected to either not get a bill or to have my lunch not charged but... I paid it and will not be returning anytime soon. With so many restaurant choices out there  who needs garbage in their salad? And if they\'re this careless with a simple salad  think what the kitchen staff might put into a burger? Or on a pizza? Ick again!"
Michelle G.,Puyallup  WA,0,6,,1/27/2016,5.0,I see that they have my favorite dish  the balboa chicken  as their picture! It is spicy enough to enjoy from a super spicy lover  yet the feta and black beans curb that heat and give a great texture and flavor to accompany the heat from the cumin. I ordered the mahi originally  and it was incredibly overwhelmed with fresh tarragon and I just couldn't eat it. They took it back after just seeing the look on my face. I didn't have to say a word! The waitress was overwhelmed by the smell  then the manager was overwhelmed when just passing by. I didn't have to worry. My new Balboa chicken came out and I ate every single morsel on the plate! I hiiiiighly recommend!
dustin g.,Puyallup  WA,22,228,133,9/19/2015,2.0,Not impressed. Brand new employee and long wait for food that was average. My second visit here in as many years and I guess I forgot what this place is like. That's right  not memorable. Should have stayed over at red robin with their one hour wait and probably got food quicker. Rough night at BJs
Melissa J.,Puyallup  WA,46,94,159,6/21/2014,3.0,If you sit at the bar you will get great service. The food is generally consistent but if you bring family in  plan on waiting a long time. The service is never good and always slow. The servers may be friendly but they are spread too thin and only return once in a while  to bring food out it back usually. They have a young staff that needs a little more training.
Brad M.,Tacoma  WA,6,7,,12/5/2015,2.0,What is BJ's supposed to be? It's not fine family dining  it's got sports games going on which nobody can see or hear. Their prices are too high for the quality. Greasy food  slow service. I wouldn't recommend going on a busy night.
Doug C.,Murfreesboro  TN,10,23,5,9/16/2015,4.0,Just had dinner at this cool place. I'm from middle TN and have never been to a BJs Brewhouse. The service here was spot on and the food is crazy good. I had the jambalaya and its was spectacular. I did some research and discovered that it had about two days worth of sodium in just one dish. That's super bad news  but not the fault of this particular store.
John S.,Lakewood  WA,0,2,,1/30/2015,1.0,"Would give 0 stars if i could. I downloaded this app solely to leave this review. We made a ""reservation"" for bjs 8 hours prior to our arrival time. They informed us that they do not make reservations but would do their best to accommodate us. We showed up 10 mins early. After over an hour of waiting  watching walk ins get seated before us we decided to leave  with hungry children in tow. We never got an explanation  or even a word from the hostess as to why  or when we would be seated. We were left to stand there  to be ignored  even when we tried to ask about our table. I\'ve worked in restaurants for a long time  and have never been more disappointed in service (or lack there of) If you want food in a somewhat timely manner  do NOT go here  you will be severely disappointed."
R T.,Pullman  WA,0,41,,2/21/2016,1.0,02/20/2016Long wait  poor service  manager that doesn't have a clue.Went to BJ's for dinner with three others. Arrived just after 7:00  waited 35 minutes to get a table. Server took order for waters and two drinks and disappeared. Other tables around us getting their beverages. Server eventually showed up with drinks and took our food order - simple calamari and flatbread appetizer  salad and pizza entre. After 30 minutes server came by and apologized they were having issues in kitchen then disappeared again. Food finally arrived. Calamari was tasteless gooey breaded item and the dipping sauces bland. I did not eat the mess and told the server how bad the dish was. Server did not offer to replace with alternate. Other food ok but nothing worth the price. Server was inattentive during the 2.5 hours we spent but at one weird point sat down at the table as if she were a friend of ours??? Asked the server to remove the calamari from the bill as it was inedible. One dessert dish ordered that took 20 minutes to arrive - after I got up and asked a couple of servers and the host desk why it was taking so long. When leaving I asked for the manager. I spoke with him for a few minutes but he just argued they were busy and had kitchen issues so basically they don't have a clue how to handle these situations and if it happens again customers will just have to suffer through poor service  long waits and uncaring staff.
Ayee M.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,12/26/2015,2.0,My ExperienceParty of 9. Seating was fair. Wait time to be asked what we would like to drink was 20-30mins. (absolutely ridiculous) We had to ask 3-4 waiters if they could take our order before finally being helped (Made my family feel as if they did it on purpose because of our ethnicity)Stay Away and Beware of...-Calamari (tasted burnt)-Ahi Poke (too much onion) -Jambalaya (not seasoned properly)-Atlantic Salmon (dry and over cooked)Food Recommendation:-Ceasar Salad-Clam Chowder-Siracha Chicken Bacon Mac and Cheese-Double Deluxe Burger-Hickory Brisket &Bacon Burger
M. J.,Bonney Lake  WA,1,41,39,11/11/2014,1.0,Second time here (our kids wanted the Pizookies) should have just ordered that. Mozzarella sticks were good- and so was the Pizookies- but the service & meal sucked. Waitress sent home after taking our order - never saw our new assigned waitress till we asked after our food was delivered. No drink refills  food arrived less than hot. Roast beef dip was awful! Sourdough bread burnt not toasted on California burger. Fries barely warm. Manager came to table and admitted that our service was less than acceptable  but didn't even offer to comp one of the Pizookies. Won't be back - really should be able to give a zero star review. Oh yeah - the lights were so dimmed we had to use phone flash lights to read the menus!!
Chloe S.,Puyallup  WA,0,23,,8/31/2015,4.0,Paisley is an AMAZING waitress  always so helpful! This is one of our favorite places for date nights  pizzokis are too good!!! So many different choices too....I usually stick with lemon parm crusted chicken and it is always amazingggggg!!! A few times I veered from my usual and wasn't as happy  husband loves the burgers and both types of fries!
Joelle C.,Sumner  WA,35,4,,10/10/2015,1.0,First and LAST visit. This place is a joke. If they tell you it will be a half hour wait be ready to wait 2 hours! Normally we would have left but  with a group of 11 trying to leave and go somewhere else was not feasible. The manager was a joke as well. Trust me when I say spend your money else where. The food was ok. However  after the inadequate hostesses and manager free would have been too much money!!
Denny C.,Puyallup  WA,14,50,34,7/30/2015,4.0,Despite mixed reviews its worth checking out BJ's to form your own opinion. I've been to BJ's multiple times  this location as well as others and I have not had a bad experience. They have a lot of options to fit different eating habits and the food is really good for a big national chain restaurant. Not to mention great beer.During this visit it was my friend  my 6 year old and I. Upon entry the staff was very friendly and professional. They instructed us it would be a 15 minute wait  fortunately it was less than 10. After we were seated our waiter was quick to our table taking drink orders and offering his help. From that point forward we were absolutely impressed by the level of service. Our waiter  wish I could remember his name to give him accolades  didn't miss a beat. He knows how big a difference the small things make in someone's experience. When I asked if they had a certain sauce  but they did not so I ordered another  he brought out what I ordered plus what he thought I might like based on my request. On top of that my friends dinner came out and before we had a chance to look at it he said he noticed the pita bread to have a slight burn on a small portion so he has already requested another order be made at no charge. First I've never had a waiter point out an issue prior to me  maybe if something was requested to be left off but was not  but definitely not in relation to the quality of preparation. Then to have another order already in the process of being made to accommodated this minor issue  that is going the extra step to make your customer happy. Oh and he didn't take my friends plate that was brought out just to make her wait for the new order. TheMy only reason for not giving 5 stars is the kids Mac'n'Cheese is no different than what I'd buy in a box at the grocery store. Outside of that I've been happy with the food  service  atmosphere and cleanliness at BJ's. I'll absolutely be back and recommend you visit yourself.
Lynne G.,Puyallup  WA,0,11,,2/22/2016,2.0,I went once and will not be back. My sister ordered a French Dip which had maybe four slices of roast beef which tasted like they were purchased from lower quality deli. The french fries could not have been fresh  they tasted like they were frozen and then deep-fried. I ordered a burger and it was mediocre. I would much rather go to Out & in or a red Robin. It was a party of three and we all agreed we would not go back to this place... the service was OK considering there were not many patrons inside. The pictures that are posted on yelp are definitely not what was delivered to our table.
Bev R.,Auburn  WA,1,14,9,9/11/2014,3.0,Beautiful inside  good music  awesome selection for a menu; not sufficient wait staff though. Need at least one more waiter so the wait ordering and receiving food doesn't take so long.
Brian P.,Puyallup  WA,0,3,,11/9/2015,1.0,S-L-O-W service! Over an hour and 20 minutes to get our meals. Meals came out wrong and had to send back Buffalo Burger because the bun was stale. Ordered pazookis and 1 came out wrong...it took 15 min to get correct desert. Slow service and bad food... Cannot think of two worse things for a restaurant.
Keith B.,Puyallup  WA,17,35,1,10/31/2015,3.0,Food is usually prepared and tastes delicious. My only negative is service is generally very so from the kitchen. The bar service is great  however.
Kristi N.,Puyallup  WA,134,25,2,10/28/2015,5.0,I've been here 3 times now and have never had slow service or issues with the wait. I'm from Atlanta and this place reminds me very much of Cheesecake Factory. I like that there is something to please everyone on the menu so I typically bring family here. I've had the mushroom Swiss burger and LOVED it as well as some really good salads and lots of beer. I would like to see this business move away from the corporate feel  since this is what is trending in the food industry  but overall I give it a great review! I also like that they have good email offers which keep me coming back!
Kourtney R.,Issaquah  WA,1,13,,3/8/2015,5.0,I've been here multiple times  always pleased. However it's usually during the day where it's slow. Last night (3/7 at 6pm) my family of 6+ a baby came in for dinner  it was very busy! Line out the door! We got in very fast and had a great experience! I'm a server so when I see a busy restaurant I relize I'm going to be there for awhile  and I'm okay with that. The kitchen and servers get backed up  so I don't expect my food out fast. But even as busy as it was  our food was out within 30 min!!! We were shocked. We were more then happy to wait longer since we were catching up with family but happily surprised that it all came out so fast. Our server was awesome also! I didn't catch her name tho  she was blonde and tan  very sweet  funny and efficient. There was a manager also helping and checking on us. That's a great team!
Crystal N.,Puyallup  WA,55,11,,10/19/2015,5.0,I was very impressed with this place! The service is great and the food is excellent! I look forward to dining there again
Jonathon D.,Kent  WA,2,2,,7/17/2015,5.0,I just dinned in at the south hill location BJ's Brewhouse and I was very satisfied! I sat out on the patio and Jessilyn my server was amazing. Honestly the best service I have had out in a very long time. Jessilyn was very sweet  friendly and always refilling my drink right on time. She had a lot of tables at the time but took very good care of my table. I ordered the new bbq burger with modifications and it came out perfect and very quickly! I would definitely come back and ask for Jessilyn again.
Jeremy S.,Puyallup  WA,26,27,5,1/22/2015,5.0,Always love coming here. Usually order my favorite the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which is always amazing  salad and of course a Pizookie for desert.
Lorraine G.,Puyallup  WA,10,6,4,9/3/2014,4.0,Had a fantastic lunch at Bjs today  but then every time I go there it's an enjoyable experience. There is rarely a time I have had to wait for a table because it has so much seating! The food is great and well priced. My family's favorite item is the pizookie. It's 3 heated cookies with a variety of icecream choices on top. Yum!
Gregory H.,Puyallup  WA,14,1,,10/10/2015,1.0,Terrible service. Took 90 min to get a small pizza along with 2 salads and a burger. Asked where our food was at got a totally lame excuse from our server (we are busy) The manager didn't come to see us. Got offered a free desert and then 40 minutes went by and we had to get to our movie while begging for our check. This place sucks and customer service is terrible. Should have walked out without paying. I will never go back if I have a choice. Don't go if you have a choice. Red Robin is better.
Lisa S.,Puyallup  WA,20,113,15,3/8/2014,3.0,Not bad for a chain. Their hand crafted root-beer is great if you like sweet root beer. Service can be slow especially on weekend nights.Food seems to be really good or bland. I enjoy their salads and pizza most. I grew up in Chicago and their pizza is similar to Chicago pizza in the depth and butteriness category.
Amanda S.,Bonney Lake  WA,79,40,37,11/24/2013,2.0,Had a great Gluten Free pizza  I will say that you should not come eat here if you have a time line or you don't like to just hang out.Second time we ate there the Tortilla soup was GREAT  but everything else thumps down. I think they have a menu that is just too big.
Dianna J.,Puyallup  WA,2,9,3,8/25/2013,2.0,I have to say first and foremost: I love BJs! I've been to Southcenter and regularly go to the one in Tacoma and the service and food is always incredible and delicious! I think the Puyallup location has a lot to love up to. The service is alright  though slow. The food on the other hand is not where it should be. We ordered nachos and our favorite pizza and both were VERY light in ingredients. There was barely any cheese or toppings on the nachos and the chips were burnt. The pizza was dry and mostly crust.It's not cheapest place to eat so when the food isn't worth it  than the experience is a bust.
Kari H.,Tacoma  WA,386,22,2,8/24/2013,1.0,The Tacoma one is excellent but I don't know what happened here.We tried it 3 times. I give up on this place. Tacoma is the only one worth going to.Jambalaya burnt. Streak Fried chicken burnt and dry. Pizza dry like a pizza time pizza. Impossible to get a refill or another beer order.
Rachel H.,Ladera Ranch  CA,732,940,13129,7/10/2013,3.0,This BJ's is as good as the ones in Cali!
Julia M.,Tacoma  WA,6,28,30,11/12/2014,1.0,"Arrived at 6:20pm & It was very busy. Was told 30 min wait - no problem. Waited 55 mins to be seated (3 of us). It seems the crowd died down after 7:30pm. 5 mins later the waitress comes to say ""what can i get for you"" with no smile. We knew exactly what we wanted since we looked at the menu while waiting for a table. It only took a couple minutes for our drinks to come out. 40 mins later our order is brought out by someone else. I wanted a medium-pink burger and fries and it came out crispy and black and the fries were cold. Friend ordered a soup and salad and her soup came out by itself. 10 mins later after her soup was gone the waitress checks on us and we had to tell her she only received half her meal. We never received drink refills. Hungry and thirsty and over 2 hours later we are just ready to go. We ask for the check and 20 mins later did not receive it. we start walking to the front of the restaurant searching for any waitress or manager. A manager approached us and we told him what was going on. He explained they were short staffed and he was the only manager on site and he is having a horrible night. He comped our meal. I appreciated that. Overall it was just a horrible experience with no acceptable excuses for the following summary of errors;55 min wait time when we were told 3095 mins to receive food from arrival timecold foodwrong ordersno drink refillsdirty windowsno check out"
Scott M.,Puyallup  WA,4,8,6,10/25/2013,4.0,My girlfriend and I had a great experience here. It was a Friday night  so a long wait for seating was expected. Five stars for Shea our waitress. As busy as it was  she was attentive and nice. I had and recommend the Balsamic glazed chicken. The chicken was grilled perfectly! It was still juicy and tender. My girlfriend had the Blonde fish and chips and liked it. The one and only complaint that we had is we were called up to be seated but stood around for another ten minutes while others were seated ahead of us.  Overall  I recommend you give it a try.
Chris C.,Graham  WA,0,15,,3/14/2014,4.0,My wife and I stumbled upon this place a few weeks back and have been back a couple times. They have a pretty diverse menu and lots of great appetizers and small plates  so instead of getting entrees  we just sampled.We tried southwest eggrolls (great)  boneless wings (ok)  garlic chicken wings (awesome!)  stuffed mushrooms (great)  and flatbread pizzas (great). Haven't found anything I'd call bad.Their pizza menu looks interesting......will have to try the deep dish pie on the next visit.
Brittany B.,Puyallup  WA,2,62,10,1/3/2015,4.0,My boss gave us a gift card to this place for Christmas. We utilized it tonight. The double brew house burger was excellent   and I had the CA Club Sandwich and it was really good . We each ordered an app. The garlic wings and calamari were both crunchy  fresh  and yummy. I was impressed with the take out process. Pull up  call the number  and get your food Puyallup BJs was on time  with great food  and outstanding customer service. Thanks and we'll definitely see you again soon.
Robyn W.,Airville  PA,10,5,1,4/11/2015,4.0,I loved this place! The food was awesome and the customer service was outstanding! To start our meal we tried the avocado eggrolls and were not disappointed. We also had the Mahi - Mahi tacos and a wedge salad  and both were excellent. Our kids were treated awesomely and again service was top notch. We will definitely be coming back!
Todd M.,Fairfield  CA,33,26,3,1/4/2014,2.0,I was heading to Tacoma with my daughters to catch a monster truck show and we decided to get some dinner first. We intended to go to Olive Garden  but the wait there was too long  and so was the wait at Red Robin. We'd never been to BJ's  but I figured it would be a good time to check it out -- the wait was a lot shorter. I guess I should have seen that as a message.The good: The restaurant was clean. Our server was pretty nice  and she was pretty good at making sure we had full drinks. My 9 year old really liked the chicken alfredo. She said it was some of the best she's ever had. They had lots of TVs and it looked like they had a decent bar area.The food: I ordered the California burger cooked medium with the thin cut fries and a side salad with Italian dressing. One of my daughters had the Chicken Alfredo and the other had a personal sized pizza with black olives. The burger was cooked as I ordered  but tasted very bland. It was as if there was no seasoning added to the meat at all. The fries were chewy and also flavorless. The salad itself was pretty fresh  but the dressing was bland and they definitely skimped on the quantity.I didn't eat either of my daughters' meals  but the pizza was overcooked. As I mentioned earlier  my other daughter really liked the chicken alfredo.Although our server was good at keeping our drinks filled  she also hovered while I was reviewing the bill. At a total of $50 for three meals  definitely not worth it. I probably will not return to BJ's unless I'm meeting up with some friends to watch football. Even then  it wouldn't be my first choice.
Amanda M.,Sequim  WA,0,11,1,5/18/2015,5.0,I have not been to BJs for about four years so bear with me. IF you see avocado egg rolls on the menu  it is a must have for sure. My mom and I used to stop in whenever she visited me. I love the pizzas they make  and every once in a while  this was a place I would frequent when I just wanted dessert. All in all  a good eating experience waiting to happen.
Jennifer A.,Spanaway  WA,14,11,22,10/17/2015,1.0,We went to BJs in puyallup for lunch today. We arrived at 1pm  waited for about 10 minutes for a table  and then we were seated. There were two adults and 3 children aged 2 months  1  and 3. Our order was taken at 1:15pm but we didn't get our food until after 2pm. We ordered a French dip sandwich with no onions  a ahi tuna salad  a kids chicken fingers and a side of mashed potatoes for the 1 year old. First of all  I asked for a cup of warm water to heat up a bottle. This alone took 30 minutes. Then when our food finally arrived over an hour later  there were onions on the French dip  the fries were cold  and we never even received the mashed potatoes. We had ordered two iced teas to drink and when we asked for a refill (yes we had to ask)  it took the waitress 10 minutes and she only refilled one of the iced teas and left the second one empty! Oh and we had waited so long that the iced tea no longer had ice and she filled it with warm tea. We had to ask for the manager not once but twice. When he came over to our table (after a good 20 minutes)  he just made excuses for why our food took so long  was wrong  and cold. He said due to their being short staffed and a larger party that came in we had bad customer service. Yeah we didn't want excuses. Then he comped the French dip and did nothing else for our extremely horrible experience. Being paying customers we don't care about what went wrong. We just care that we had such a horrible lunch. We spent over two hours at a restaurant to get a salad and a sandwich. Ridiculous! Then when we were trying to leave we had to ask for our bill. It was never brought to us so we ended up having to drag 3 screaming kids who were very unhappy up to the front to pay our bill. We won't ever be returning and honestly you shouldn't waste your time at a restaurant that cares so little about the quality of their food and their lack of customer service.
Dannette W.,WA  WA,6,14,,5/11/2015,4.0,Food was all good. Environment was nice. The manager went out of his way to make sure we felt welcome. The french fries came out cold and he replaced them with no issues. We will eat there again.
Kaylie Z.,Puyallup  WA,64,23,4,1/15/2016,1.0,My boyfriend and I went to this location last night. We got seated right away and the hostess was really nice. We sat there patiently waiting for the waitress to come take our drink order. There were 3 other parties that come in after us. All 3 parties that came in after us got served before we did. We patiently waited for about 45 minutes before leaving. Never did the waitress come over to us once. We spoke to the hostess and he apologized to us. I don't understand why they didn't acknowledge us when they weren't that busy and there were 4 waiters. We finally left and went to buffalo wilds wings. Their service is so much better. We usually go to Bj's all the time but last night was the last time we will be going to this location.
Jim S.,Tacoma  WA,8,38,,6/17/2013,2.0,I have to agree with all of the poor reviews here. Admittedly it was only open for a couple weeks when we visited  but the service was probably the worst we have ever had. The meal took FOREVER to come out  and our server never checked on us  never offered any explanation  or any excuses. Food was ok  but nothing so unique that you can't get it somewhere else with better service. Typical mall type restaurant. Crowded  slow service  and bland.Do yourself a favor and go try a small  family owned local business.
K R.,Lincoln City  OR,0,4,,2/21/2014,1.0,Waiting for 20 minutes and didn't received water. The previous time the food was cold and over cookedI'll not be back.
Syndi B.,Yelm  WA,47,201,15,10/13/2013,4.0,I love BJs. I have gone several times and have never had slow or terrible service. Granted I typically go shortly after they open when I know it won't be packed. The food is wonderful though. I absolutely love the garlic Parmesan boneless chicken. Their pulled pork sandwich is moist and tangy. Their fries are very thin  which is unusual  but a nice change from the steak cut fries at every other place. The pot roast is tender and the veggies that come with it are presented beautifully on the plate. I've tried several of their handcrafted non-alcoholic drinks (cream soda  root beer  etc) and they too were good....though not much different in taste than name brands. FYI- they open an hour early on weekends during football season. There are always games on throughout the restaurant so you can watch some football and eat a nice meal!
Joe H.,Bonney Lake  WA,0,26,17,2/18/2015,4.0,Other than the dark atmosphere  this place is an adequate dinner place for family or dates. Extra star for knowing how to make good mozzarella sticks  and having tasty IPAs. Service is nothing special  my guess is they probably aren't good to their employees. Nevertheless tip em good  they're trying.
Dean S.,Puyallup  WA,102,42,,2/11/2014,3.0,I have eaten there about 6 times. Every time I have really enjoyed the food. However  getting served and the speed of the kitchen has sucked. 3 of the 8 times we almost walked out. If you have A LOT of time  go enjoy the good food. Avoid this place if you want regular speed of service.
Sweet P.,Puyallup  WA,0,47,11,6/14/2014,5.0,Shea at BJ's is the best!! She was an amazing server and bartender. Not only did she provide OUTSTANDING service to us  she even asked about our weekend plans  and our upcoming wedding! Shea really made me feel special when she asked to see pics of my wedding dress. :) That's about the quickest way to make a gal feel special! Thank you Shea  for leaving a lasting impression. You are a great employee!
Gerald M.,Honolulu  HI,10,6,2,11/28/2014,5.0,Very good menu selection  very good service  and very good quality food. Great selection if beers on tap. A definite place to return  To.
Allen B.,Tacoma  WA,5,126,1,12/24/2013,4.0,My first visit here was about 2 weeks after they had opened. Not impressed. But they will readily comp unsatisfied patrons. I didn't post a review because I wanted to give them some time to work out the kinks. I can happily say they are on the right track. Very friendly and attentive service. The shrimp tacos had great flavor and a lunchtime bargain at 8 bucks. The burger did the trick and also not a wallet drainer. Beers were frosty cold and tasty. As long as the place isn't slammed  you'll get served in a timely manner.
Carrie B.,Rio Rancho  NM,20,25,57,10/6/2014,5.0,"Went here and wasn\'t to sure about t because my family had a horrible experience about 3weeks ago. However it was awesome tonight!We were seated fairly quickly and in the section with all the other Seahawk fans  I assume because one of our party was wearing one of their shirts. It was a little loud but my group did participate in the hooting with the ""goals"". I ordered the California Chicken Club and it was perfect! I loved the garlic mayo and the wedge fries weren\'t drenched in season salt which is a plus. My group also had a Roast Beef Dip sandwich  and a BBQ Chicken Salad. They both enjoyed their meals as well and the sizes on all of the food was so big we had enough to bring home for leftovers. Our server  Kelly I think  was awesome. She took her time to joke with us and remembered what we had mentioned earlier in the evening. Our food was super fast and she kept our drinks filled. A++ all around."
N C.,Tacoma  WA,0,15,3,8/7/2014,2.0,Puyallup BJ's has the slowest service. Regardless of the time of day we've gone or party size  the service is always very slow. Happy hour apps and drinks are only served in the bar area  too.
Soraya V.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,41,36,38,11/20/2013,2.0,"Terrible service!My sister and I went for an early dinner and we were very disappointed. The waitress was sloppy  left us waiting  brought food to our table and we didn\'t even have utensils  the drinks were not properly made and at one point I asked for a napkin and she took out one that look like she had been using as tissue paper and put it on the table saying; ""oh it looks bad but it\'s clean"". The food was good  no complains there  but this place needs a serious service overhaul!I agree with a lot of the previous reviews."
Anastasia J.,Puyallup  WA,9,35,10,9/19/2013,1.0,Today we decided to spend my sons first birthday at Bjs. I was told at the front to let my waiter know that it was his birthday because they do special things for birthdays just like evety other place. I did. I was seated at table 301 with svrck 4 on 9/19/2013 at 5:14pm Im going to guess my server did not belive me because my son looks like he is 6 months old. But I was very disappointed after being told something and it not happening. He was very pacient with me while I was trying to order my drink and I was very apriciative of that. But he was very short with us. Was not as friendly as I would have hoped and did not tell anyone about the birthday we were celibrating. The food here is wonderful the burgers are one if the best I have had. But I don't think I will be coming back any time soon.
Otto R.,Puyallup  WA,203,455,204,6/5/2013,3.0,Gave this place a 3 or average. I had the balsamic chicken with mashed potatoes and it was pretty good. Price point was on point as well.  Wife had Santa Fe chicken salad and remarked that she liked it.Things we didn't like was how low the booth dividers  pretty low  especially challenging if you have little ones in tow. Also I get they are trying to figure out capacity with demand but it took us about 25 minutes to get our food at noon. A little too long for wait at noon.
Jordan M.,Tacoma  WA,18,9,,5/16/2014,1.0,"Extremely disappointed with our experience tonight. We had a choice between Red Robin and BJ\'s  we tried BJ\'s for the first time. WOW what a waste of money! First of all we called ahead to get on the list which was an hour wait at that point  get to the restaurant an hour later and now have a 20 minute wait. We\'re seated at our table and waited about 15 minutes before being asked about beverages  and apparently water isn\'t a given anymore? Whatever. Anyways we ordered appetizers. Took about 30 minutes to get those  whatever. We got avocado rolls and flatbread pizza. The flatbread pizza is comparable to a Tony\'s Party Pizza for $1 at the grocery store  the avocado rolls we\'re the only good thing I ate all night. Oh! and we were asked if we\'d like to order our meals while we were waiting for our appetizers because apparently we had been waiting awhile already. So we finish the appetizers and we\'re talking  and waiting..... Waiting some more..... WAITING. NO ONE came to say ""Hey sorry it\'s taking so long""  ""Your food will be right out""  or ""Can I get you anything else while you wait"". NOTHING. After about an hour and a half of being there we finally get ours meals  just as we were about to stand up and investigate this wait. Well  the food was not worth the wait. Subpar burgers  tastless pasta  and blah overall. While we were eating our meals we ordered our dessert as well so we wouldn\'t have to wait again. We order the famous cookie pie. Again  disappointed. It\'s hot cookie dough with some ice cream.... OH I also forgot to mention we had two small children with us patiently waiting thru all this without any screaming episodes  they were troopers. Needless to say  we will NEVER be back. We also will not recommend to anyone. *Side note  my fiance ordered a beer while we were waiting to be seated and the bartender served him the wrong beer. When he sipped it he handed it back and said that\'s not my beer. The lady bartender replied ""Damn  I was hoping you didn\'t notice"". Classy  real classy BJ\'s.*"
Cathy F.,Puyallup  WA,0,8,,2/21/2015,2.0,Our favorite place for Mac and cheese...NOT ANY MORE! Used to be gourmet...light and tasty...now  dry and the cheese sauce very salty and gloppy! Probably won't have it again...California flat bread not the same either...pesto used to be on it...now a ranch sauce...Why do places mess with good things??
Keri G.,Eatonville  WA,0,3,,2/11/2015,4.0,It took a little over twenty minutes to get our food. The hand crafted root beer and cream soda are delicious! I thought the black cherry soda tasted flat. I ordered the bbq lunch platter. The bbq chicken was salty and the bbq sauce on it didn't compliment it well. The bbq pork slider was delicious though. The cole slaw side had quarter size hunks of cabbage heart. Yuck! The wedge fries were well cooked but flavorless. My husband had the chicken quesedilla lunch special. The black beans were very well seasoned. The quesedilla had only a little bit of filling though. He loved the avacado cream sauce on top. For two of us  it only cost $22.15 for lunch. Nice atmosphere. Very nice staff. Will return to see if other menu items are better.
Steve S.,Puyallup  WA,0,7,,1/24/2015,2.0,Sat at bar  Service slow. Had to beg for simple silverware or salt or a napkin. Food was lousy. Won't come back.
Jason C.,Tacoma  WA,35,9,10,11/11/2014,1.0,Nope won't be back..... Kelsey was good.... Cook must have been greener than the sad asparagus that show up on my plate..... Absolutely the worst rib eye ever. Guess I should have stuck with the south center location.
L L.,Olympia  WA,21,17,17,11/8/2015,1.0,Stopped by yesterday party of 3 I love Bj's is Tacoma but this was very different experience. Very slow service. Our waitress was nice but disappeared for long periods of time. The staff that checked us in and seated us where very snobby and rude. They also skipped seating us and we waited along time to be seated. We eventually had to change our order and get our food to go. I ordered a virgin drink and all they did was pour syrup over ice it also made me throw up I had to fix it with sprite. They may have the same food but this is nothing like the BJ's i have been to before!
Kalli S.,Puyallup  WA,0,26,16,11/5/2014,1.0,The waitress spilt ranch on half our party. When we asked for more water it came 15 minutes later and she gave it to another table that asked her right then for water. We never got our water after asking again.. the food came out and I didn't get the right plate and my bf didn't get his at all. We walked out because of such bad service. I will never go back.
Jennifer D.,Tacoma  WA,21,26,18,6/11/2014,4.0,! Please read this!    I came in for lunch today and I decided to get the half sandwich and soup or salad. I ordered the California chicken sandwich which had pepper jack cheese  green chilies  grilled chicken  avocado  Chipotle mayo on toasted sourdough. I found out it not only comes with soup or salad  but it also comes with ether thin fries or wedge season fries. I asked for the think crispy fries and asked for a house salad. I loved everything about my meal. The sandwich was not spicy at all but yet very good. The salad was really good I asked for balsamic vinaigrette and that was awsome I left both of my plates clean. I got all of that a salad  half of a sandwich and fries for $8.50 I thought it was a deal. I would love to go back. Ps. It can get pretty busy.
Renee R.,Puyallup  WA,70,12,11,8/2/2015,2.0,"Okay  so I can honestly say that I have been to this restaurant several times and each experience has been mediocre at best. What is giving this restaurant two stars is the simple blatant lack of basic customer service. Every time I\'ve eaten here  the servers are not friendly  nor do they go out of their way to ensure that their customers are satisfied. I went here last week with my kids and my friend  and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 40 minutes after that to get our food! Not to mention that the waitress never once checked on us or apologized for the delay. I mean  seriously?!? How long does it take to make a pizookie trio and an appetizer? Maybe I am wrong and the pizookies do take a long time to make  but even so  there is absolutely no reason why our server completely ignored us for nearly an hour  and only came by our table to drop drinks off. I had to stop her at one point and ask how much longer it was going to be since my six-year-old was getting restless. She came back with our food within minutes  and still failed to apologize. She didn\'t have an out-going personality or have a smile the entire time...I mean  I understand that we all have ""off"" days  but this is your job!! The ONLY thing that keeps me coming back is their amazing pizookie desserts! Yum! Aside from that  I would rather go to any of the other three restaurants surrounding BJ\'s."
Tim I.,University Place  WA,0,6,1,9/20/2013,3.0,"The hunt for real Deep Dish pizza continues. I spent 4 college years in Chicago and have yearned for decent deep dish here in the Northwest. Has anyone found real deep dish? The closest I\'ve seen is San Francisco. First time to BJs and saw deep dish on their menu. Needless to say I\'m still looking. Not only was it not deep dish (I\'d say it\'s more ""dish"" than deep) but the bottom of the pie was a little soggy. That being said  the service was good and the flavors on the 5 meat was good and the dough tasted really good."
Rachel G.,Orting  WA,0,7,,6/19/2016,1.0,We went here last night for my daughters birthday the service and food was horrible  the place wasn't even packed we placed our order and 40 min later the waitress comes back and tells they are remaking one of the meals because it had been sent to another table. She came back 10 minutes later and said the manager would be by she never asked us for refills on our drinks when food came out it was disgusting had been sitting under heat lamp and the sandwich that had to be remade was cold along with the fries. While sitting there we noticed 4 other tables come in and order and receive their food theme was have someone who graduated from Puyallup with you and get service. Manager came over and did nothing we walked out the only thing he said while twiddling his thumbs and not looking at us was give my daughter a gift card for like $20 really. We will not be back. Let me also add I got food poisoning from my side salad which was the only food that came out.
Tricia W.,Puyallup  WA,17,15,,7/20/2015,2.0,This is a late post. My husband and I have been here twice this month to meet a group and both times have been horrible. We usually love Bjs. It seems like this location is going down hill  the service is horrible. It seems like the waiting staff maybe stretched too thin...the service was so slow  we could not get a refill and both times our food was mixed up. We may drive out to Tacoma if we decide to go again  unfortunate!
Lissette S.,Fayetteville  AR,4,32,4,8/6/2015,3.0,Pretty good. Standard American fare with more healthy options than your typical chain restaurants. I had the Kale and Roasted Brussel Sprouts salad with shrimp; hubby the chicken and Quinoa bowl. Both were good  although not great. Our kiddo wasn't fond of the happy face potatoes  so we will stick with standard fries in the future. Our server was friendly enough  but service/kitchen was REALLY SLOW. I mean  REALLY SLOW. Didn't stay for dessert.
April And PJ D.,Seaside  OR,1,103,5,11/1/2015,2.0,Nailbanger Here Again;I recieved a $10 Off a $35 via email and decided to give it a go. We ordered the Potato Skin Appitizer and the BJ Special Deep Dish Pizza.The Potato Skins were O.K. but not worth $10. The Pizza was better but not worth $26.So over all the food was O.K. buy not worth the cost.They have a full Bar  but watch out the drinks are not priced and are crazy expensive.The service was a bit slow over all  but bearable.The attmosphere is Upbeat and nicely done.They have plenty of well lighted parking.
Teri B.,Buckley  WA,6,36,12,2/19/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Once again we tried to go here as my daughter was craving jumbalya. unfortunately the avacado spring rolls tasted old and frozen instead of fresh oh and cold! The pizzas actually came out cool to touch and my grandson would not even eat the mac cheese! what 8 yr old dosn't love mac n cheese. The only thing that came out hot and fresh was the jumbalya. VERY SAD!! Manager did come over after we asked for a different kids meal  they replaced it and took off the spring rolls but still its been over a year you would think this would not be happening it was as if everything waited for the one meal to cook and was just sitting there under the lights. VERY DISAPPOINTED YET AGAIN
Kenny G.,Tacoma  WA,45,5,7,6/23/2015,5.0,Back again :) everything is great as usual! Brought an apitite for destruction tonight. Ready to wreck the double burger. Seemed fitting with this perfectly pour (almost too strong) double tequila sour. Wedge fries for the win with this leaning tower of beef bacon and cheese.
Maddy D.,Puyallup  WA,1,3,1,11/25/2014,5.0,I LOVE this place!! It's so good! My favorite is the bacon cheese burger with shoe string fries #yummy
Scott L.,Seattle  WA,46,28,,5/18/2014,2.0,I'm giving this place two stars for the ambience.  They had a Shrimp pasta dish that I requested be substituted with chicken. I took a couple of bites and pushed it aside. Extremely over seasoned and you could not taste any of the true flavors if the dish. Very simply dish with a little olive oil and chicken. Not sure what was used as a season but it was way too much.
James M.,Spanaway  WA,52,123,44,12/9/2013,4.0,Love the atmosphere  great prices  and good food. We have been here two times  and both visits where good. They have a great selection of beers and ales.   They can get very busy at times.
Shannon V.,Salt Lake City  UT,2,44,8,12/5/2013,1.0,Awful service and food! The first BJ's I went to was in Las Vegas and it was awesome! I went to this one with my family and the service was awful- they barely came around to check on how our food was or to fill our water glasses. And the food was terrible  let alone the fact that it took a whole hour for them to bring us our food after ordering! Extremely unimpressed! What happened  BJs??
Heather A.,Bonney Lake  WA,68,66,3,3/30/2015,1.0,Well so disappointing!! We ordered the French dip and soups and salad. Salad came out 17 min after we ordered by itself. Ten minutes later the rest of our food came. My husband's sandwich was burnt so we sent it back and let them know we were in a hurry. Mine was the unlimited which is a good concept but when you have to wait ten minutes to get your next soup or salad it's not worth it. It has been 50 min right not since the time of ordering and still don't the next soup... I don't get what's going on here. Had to add ran out of water twice  calm chowder was good  chili tasted alot like the ale and tortilla soup tasted alot like lime. Don't ever plan on coming back. Last thing I think the lady that brings the food out hates her life.
MacKenzie M.,Federal Way  WA,1,8,,7/11/2014,2.0,Currently sitting here right now. Watching 8 of their employees stand around and chat  while a couple in the bar just walked out because they weren't greeted for over 10 minutes. Great customer service  guys.
Andy V.,Spanaway  WA,0,3,,7/8/2015,4.0,Great food  great service. The fried chicken is the best! This restaurant is always clean  fast and friendly service. They have a great rewards member card that builds up over time and just payed for my last dinner!
Destiny B.,Puyallup  WA,0,38,2,9/17/2014,1.0,"One star  only because the manager comped our meal! So tonight  we go here (my other half dragging me by the hair  2 previous  horrible visits  and his ""lets give it another try attitude"") let\'s just say it was just as horrible as the other 2 visits if not a bit worse! So let\'s just say this started off not so great from the beginning and gradually got worse as the evening went on! Our server took forever to take our order  my 2 year old was nearly chewing my arm off she was so hungry! Then our food arrived  they bring me the wrong food  and bring my daughter her order which is 1/2 correct. So the server  Nick  takes my order back and even managed to admit he put in the wrong item for me and my daughter. After about 10-12 minutes they bring me out another plate of food  yep  still wrong! At this point I\'m done  as server after server (I believe 5)  kept bringing the wrong side dish to my daughter. So finally a manager comes over  offers to remake my food again  nope  I\'m done! Then wants to give us a card for a percentage off our meal next time we come in  um....nope! We WILL NOT be returning. So she goes off to wherever and comes back and says she comped the whole meal  I told her she didn\'t need to do that  and she said she wanted to. Okay  fine...but does that mean at that point we get NO service at all? Yep  none! My son and my other half  got zero water refills  zero soda refills  ZERO attention from any staff member! As we left  pis*ed off  the manager and said server  Nick were outside chatting it up! Thanks for the superb service  NOT! I\'ll be sure and tell everyone I know to avoid this place!!!"
Michelle L.,Halifax  Canada,21,15,3,2/14/2014,1.0,one of the worst visits to a restaurant ever. The waitress was horrible. She never brought us water  she reached over our plates and wiped her hands over our food. The seats facing the door are almost impossible. You can't see the people sitting across from you. The burger was dripping grease  my fries were not hot and the bacon was barely warm. The table was dirty and she was LITERALLY turning her head and paying attention to other tables when I was trying to tel her what we wanted. She actually walked over to another table while I was talking. Ridiculous! She messed up my order and generously messed up. It is not worth your time. I promise.
Marcie L.,Orting  WA,1,4,,5/27/2013,1.0,Today was our first and last visit to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. We were told we would be seated immediately if we chose to sit in the covered  heated outdoor patio. We still had to wait. After that it was a continual wait for service. My husband's fettuccine alfredo had undercooked noodles. We sent it back. The waitress offered my husband a cup of soup or salad while he waited for his dish. The clam chowder seemed to be canned. The fettuccine Alfredo returned only to be in the same condition. This time my husband said never mind he didn't want it back or anything else. The waitress apologized and said she would have the manager come over to talk to us while she got boxes for my son and my leftover food. She came back with our boxes  grabbed our card for payment  and came back. The manager never came to talk to us. Needless to say the service was poor and the fact that the manager didn't even come to offer an apology speaks volumes. The waitress said she told him 2x to come see us.My burger and my son's pizza were both good; but we will not return.
Tim M.,Tacoma  WA,2,96,20,6/16/2013,4.0,Went here yet again  4th time since the opening. I have yet to go here when it wasn't absolutely slammed to capacity. This place really packs email in! Every time I've gone here the food has been great. I see a lot of reviews complaining about wait times  but if you realize it's a 200 seat restaurant filled to capacity you might understand the kitchen is probably slammed. I'm willing to give them a small pass on an extra 10 minutes if my food quality stays the way it's been. I'm still a fan of this place and will continue to be a return customer.
Patrick B.,Tacoma  WA,54,6,5,6/28/2014,3.0,Enjoyed the tortilla soup and the black & blue burger. Good brew  great food. Staff. . . did I mention they have great food?
Rich C.,Puyallup  WA,9,103,1,8/13/2013,4.0,"Truthfully I\'m really not sure why everyone else is banging on this place (for once). We had a large family table and our server Gwen was an absolute joy. All of the food was family style  just right for sharing and we all enjoyed it right down to the last morsel. The beer was decent. It wasn\'t ""stellar"" as far as beers go  but it was good enough that I\'d try it again. Also it was clear they knew we had 3 kids with us at the table and they hurried to get the food out and it came out quick  and hot. The other thing was really nice was my son wasn\'t 100% sure about their BBQ sauce. They let him try it to make sure he liked it before ordering wings! Give it a shot  folks and I\'m sure if you\'re right time right place you\'ll go home happy. By the way  skip the lunchmeat if you can. It was a take home  but was spoiled walking out the door. For a 10$ sandwich  they should know better."
Shannon M.,San Diego  CA,11,13,2,6/16/2013,1.0,Worst service I have experienced in a long time. Food came out cold or in some cases didn't come out at all. Had to send back the pizza to be warmed up and that took forever. Manager offered a free Pizookie to make up for the service. It took a 1/2 hour to get the Pizookie and we had to ask someone to go check to see where it was. Terrible and no  they weren't that busy.
Paul C.,Puyallup  WA,2,11,,2/1/2014,5.0,Went to BJ's for dinner tonight with the family. My son had an Excellent Achievement award from school. This got him a free kids meal. The manager took the time to come to the table and shake his hand and have him an achievement pin to show what he had done. Very classy and much appreciate the manager taking the time to do this. Not to mention that all the food was good and the service was nearly perfect. We will be back.
Jessica J.,Puyallup  WA,51,78,26,12/3/2014,3.0,I love BJ's and it's a great place to eat anytime: lunch  dinner or late night Happy Hour. Their menu is pages long  so you can sure to find something you like. I highly recommend the Crusted Parmesan Chicken and the Asian Chop Salad (it's on the EnLIGHTened Menu!) Both are super yummy! I do prefer the Tacoma location as opposed to the Puyallup location. The Puyallup location has been open for about 2 years  but they are still so slow. When we go during lunch  we always tell the waitress that we're on lunch but they're still so slow to get us our food and bill. It's frustrating  because the food is good  but most of the time we'll pick another restaurant altogether. Even today our waitress kept forgetting to come check on us and when she did  she'd forget our drinks or our bill or the fact that we had a To Go Order. If you have time to spare  I'd definitely go  but if not  I'd pick another place.
Heather K.,Seattle  WA,0,22,,2/8/2014,3.0,I have liked the other BJ's in Tacoma and Southcenter and have given the Puyallup location several opportunities and it's just ok. There are better options on South Hill.The 3 stars are because it has nice decor  wait staff had been fine and the pazookie dessert is a signature.
Jeannie R.,Bonney Lake  WA,0,10,,8/11/2013,3.0,I have been here four times since they opened. I have to say they are consistent with SLOW service.Here are a couple of other things to say:My husband and I ordered the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps Appetizer. They did not bring plates for us to eat from so we were both eating over the one main plate. We wanted to ask for small plates but our waitress was not around.We were there after the dinner rush - 8:30 and it took over half an hour for us to get our meal.My husband ordered the boneless chicken wings and was very disappointed. The chicken was poor quality pressed meat  like a chicken McNugget. The celery that came with it was hot on his plate. Maybe they should wait to add the celery until they bring it out  not let it sit with the chicken under the warming lights.In the bar  the tables are placed very close to each other  so you are practically elbow to elbow with strangers.Beware of the parking lot - the spaces are all for compact cars and you will probably get a door ding.All that being said  I do like some of the other items I have ordered. The stuffed mushrooms are a very good deal. I liked the Shrimp Lettuce Wraps very much. I also like the veggie flat bread pizza. i was also pleased with their happy hour offerings.On a different visit  two of my friends ordered the Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza and were very disappointed with the lack of toppings. One time my husband ordered the Mahi-Mahi Tacos and there was hardly any Mahi Mahi in them.
Anthony B.,Puyallup  WA,3,26,,4/21/2015,3.0,Still among my favorite foods in town  but twice disappointed by the sports selection. If you don't subscribe to all major sports packages  you are not a sports bar. Similarly if you air documentary over both NHL and NBA playoff games  you're failing. If you showed sports I'd rate five stars.
Tim T.,Puyallup  WA,0,8,,6/28/2013,1.0,"Worst burger I have ever had. Server was inattentive and slow. Took me asking twice to get napkins and silverware after our food had been served to us. I got the beer I ordered after eating half my ""burger "" if you can call it that. IF I go back I will try the seafood. Not sure I will go back though."
Jennifer S.,Puyallup  WA,0,9,1,5/3/2013,1.0,SLOW  COLD food  Horrible service. We went to BJ's for the first time last weekend  everything started out fine until about 45 minutes had past and we were still waiting for our food  and no server in sight. When our food did finally come out (not even all of it because mine was apparently still not ready) it was ALL very cold  like it had all been sitting out for quite a while. When mine finally came  my fries were hot but the rest was ice cold! We let our server know that all the food was cold and asked nicely if he could just take it off the bill because we were not going to eat any of it  nor did we want to sit and wait for another HOUR for them to microwave our meals. I am not a picky eater  but our food wasn't even lukewarm and it wasn't something I was going to let my children eat when God knows how long it sat out. We will NOT be returning to BJ's.
HP T.,Puyallup  WA,0,4,,1/11/2014,1.0,Three strikes! Third visit here and food is sub par and the customer service all visits is the worst in the restaurant business.  Today the bartender was surly  rolled her eyes at customers when they were not looking  and somewhat defensive when questioned about needing more help at the bar on a NFL Divisional local gameday. I ordered the top sirloin rare  steamed veggies  and baked potato. The steak was over cooked  some of the veggies were mush and others were still raw. Dessert of a scoop of ice cream with chocolate sauce heated on the side had to be sent back twice before it was correct. Too bad this BJ's is consistently below average.
Ryan H.,Haines City  FL,0,6,,3/14/2014,1.0,Been here twice now. Literally the worst service I have ever had! People are horrible! Food average! Managers are a joke!
Janelle F.,Puyallup  WA,1,31,,2/24/2015,4.0,We ended up here for my daughter's birthday  as the Red Robin next door was really busy. I have had a few experiences with really ridiculously slow service at the Tacoma location  so I was wary  but we decided to give it a shot. First of all  no one greeted us for several minutes when we came in  even though one employee was at the front for a short time. We were literally about to walk out and try our luck at Olive Garden when the host walked up. We were seated almost immediately (there was a decent crowd but it is a nice big restaurant) and received attentive and friendly service for the remainder of the visit. We tried the deep dish pizza  and were not disappointed. My husband recently took a business trip to Chicago and was not impressed with the greasy cheese slabs there  so he was very happy with this lighter take. Drinks  salads and appetizers were all served quickly  and our waitress was very cheerful and even patient with the seven-year-old  who threw a couple of odd requests her way. As for the food  the pizza was great as mentioned  the roast beef dip and turkey  ham and bacon sandwich were fine  the chicken wings nice and spicy  and the mozzarella sticks were all that deep fried cheese should be. We were happy with the selection of local brews (Iron Horse Brewery Irish Death! Try it.)  and the free birthday pizookie was a nice touch. All in all it was a very good experience  and we will definitely be back. Tacoma could learn a thing or two!
Marissa L.,Tacoma  WA,98,282,100,4/15/2013,3.0,"I\'ve loved BJ\'s food since I lived in California and was finally able to convince the boyfriend to go with me for a late lunch yesterday. When we got there the wait for a 2 top was 15 minutes so we hunted down 2 seats at the bar. The food as usual was yummy. I had the fried artichokes which happen to be a personal favorite and did not disappoint. I also tried their new Black and Blue appetizer flatbread pizza which was good  but could have been a little more crispy. Josh had an asian salad of some kind which he thought was OK  but it took him awhile to locate some of the supposed ingredients (like mango) and it appeared that the kitchen was in a rush as they barely cut the avocado on top leaving Josh to have to cut it on top of the salad (not cool). As to the service it started out fine  and progressively slipped. At the start of the meal I asked the bartender to please split the check as we were going ""dutch"" on this date. I am quite sure she heard me because she said ok and nodded. Every time she added something we ordered she came back with one slip (I thought maybe it was split on the one check so I didn\'t sweat it and never picked it up). After a fairly long wait for our food I looked at the check to find it was NOT split. By this point our bartender serving us had disappeared. The new bartender seemed to take forever t help us and when he did there was apparently nothing he could do because the check was on the other girls name...While he was attempting to find someone to help she whizzed by the back of me claiming she ""had to go"" and touched my back asking if I was ready to pay. The new bartender then explained I wanted the checks split so she then split the checks and disappeared again. We waited about another 5 minutes to have them collect our credit cards so we could pay and leave. It\'s a good thing I enjoy their food cause the service left a lot to be desired."
Anna C.,Frisco  TX,1,12,1,5/17/2014,5.0,First time eating at this location. Found it to be just as good at the Tacoma Mall location  but with more convenient parking. Food was fantastic (as usual) and our server was very accommodating with special menu adjustments we requested. The beer choices are endless & each is better than the last. I would highly recommend this eating establishment to my family & friends!
Kyle B.,Olympia  WA,78,36,4,6/17/2013,3.0,Looks classy. LOOKS. Beer is served warm. Slow service. My chicken parmesean sandy was pretty darn tootin.
J. S.,Puyallup  WA,0,13,,1/25/2014,2.0,Don't go on Friday or Saturday in a group....Six of us showed up at 7:00 pm  and was told there would be an hour wait.A couple dozen people were seated before us  all in parties of 4 or less.To make matters worse  they had an entire section of open tables that we could have been seated at.When they took us to be seated  it was clearly evident that we could have been seated sooner...The food was good. Our server was polite  but seldom seen. It leads me to believe that they may have been understaffed  perhaps which is why they left tables open without seating my group.
Tracey P.,Bonney Lake  WA,75,41,,5/21/2014,3.0,My two sons and I visited last night and had a great dinner - waitstaff was very nice  as was the dcor. We had never been to one of these restaurants before. I am really glad we stayed  because I almost walked out. When we came in there were MANY open tables  yet a line. There were two hostesses behind the counter and I have no idea what they were doing. One girl seated a party of four  and the other began talking with the next party. They were then seated immediately. Now it was my turn - she asked me if I was a rewards member I said what's that we have never been here before - oh ok wait over there......She never answered me about the rewards club  she never said welcome I am so glad you are here for the first time  but looked at me with distain and made us wait for a good 5 minutes while she and the other girl milled around and then finally looked over and said okay we can seat you now. Was I being punished for coming in for the first time or not being a member of a secret club or what - there were tons of tables available and were well staffed. There are a lot of other choices in the same parking lot and because of the look of the restaurant we waited - I was curious. I would  however  find some new hostesses - train them on how to be nice  et cetera. Not a smile out of either of them  as a business owner I would not tolerate that  and obviously it was an issue or I would not be taking the time to write this note. We will come again because of the waitress who was tipped at 20% she saved the day. Oh and these were my 2 adult sons so it was not me and 2 small children. They eat out a lot too and have a lot of 20-something friends and were also put off by these girls. Just saying. Hey and maybe you can contact me back and tell me about the Rewards Club or whatever I am not a member of - still wondering what's wrong with me that it was a secret on my first visit ever.
Tim F.,Puyallup  WA,5,50,5,6/3/2013,1.0,Kitchen is slow.. our starter came out cool  called waitress over an informed her our wings was cold an she just gave a blank look an we waited for an answer so after a few seconds of awkward silence I told her take them off the bill. Wife had the stuffed baked potato I had the jalapeno burger. The potato was dry but it did come out hot almost over cooked. The burger was cool kept cuz I was hungry. The burger was good would of been better if it was hot. Over all I'm no impressed with the place. Can say will not come back an can't recommend this place..
Ed S.,Federal Way  WA,28,8,,12/13/2013,5.0,The pizza here is awesome. Little personal size ones for cheap on Fridays. They have great home brewed beer. The seating is open and fantastic service from the entire staff. Never had a bad meal. Would recommend this place to anyone. Got a hot date go to BJ's!
Trevor S.,Puyallup  WA,1,5,,1/28/2015,3.0,I have read several of the reviews here on Yelp and so far I have not been convinced to try this place. I have been by it several times and it appears to be a very nice establishment. After reading the reviews  it seems that it may need a lot of training on the service side of things. I am going to give it a shot  but you have a lot to live up to. One is that the food service should not be more than 12-14 minutes from time of ordering to delivery for the entrees and 7-8 minutes for the appetizers upon delivery. The beverages should never be more than 5 minutes. And  when the beverages come out so should the flatware and the coasters. This way the flatware is available upon arrival of the appetizers and no one is left wondering.Get ready I am coming this week and I only ask for these few things to happen with a sincere smile. I love to give compliments and catch people doing things right and never really want to write anything the contrary.Good Luck!
Draven W.,Puyallup  WA,2,18,1,5/7/2013,1.0,Really wanted to like this place. I ordered the grilled chicken club and my wife ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. When our food came out it was a turkey club and the fettuccine Alfredo. i didn't order the turkey club  honest mistake I get it. Not once were we asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks after that missed order nor did the waiter acknowledge us as he helped others around us. After watching my wife gnaw on the hard as a rock garlic bread that came with her fettuccine Alfredo my grilled chicken club finally came out  it was mediocre  and there was no ketchup in sight nor was I asked if I needed one. We flagged down someone to get more refills and ketchup. There's a grip of workers there for such horrible service. I'll never go there again or recommend to anyone.
Bill H.,Bonney Lake  WA,1,7,,11/29/2013,4.0,Great food. Lots if variety tasty appetizers. Lots of brew selections. Will be going back. Wait staf top notch.
Kathy N.,Tacoma  WA,0,7,,4/8/2014,5.0,Don't understand the reviews~~eat here at least once a month since they opened and have never had a bad meal or service~~their burgers and pizzas are the best in puyallup~~they do put too much pepper in their southern gravy~~great place
Debbie M.,Spanaway  WA,39,63,3,12/17/2014,3.0,foods good  drink prices are a little high  nice inside
joel s.,Puyallup  WA,30,3,2,4/28/2013,3.0,good service. good beer. great food. tables are way to close together. i dont like someones butt over my food when they try and squeeze in between the tables
Dede H.,Bonney Lake  WA,1,5,,3/13/2014,2.0,It has been several months since I've been to this BJ's but I tried this place twice. The first time the services was super slow but the fish & chips were really good. We decided to try it again a couple months later. We sat there for 20 minutes and finally a server was walking toward us. She passed us and stopped at the table next to us and they were seated 10 min after us. So I'm thinking okay  she will come here next. She walks off in the opposite direction of us and disappeared. At that point we just got up and left. The other weird thing is it was lunch time and there weren't that many people in the place but they sat the other people that came in after us right smack up against our table and they asked to be moved. So later that day I emailed BJ's on their website  nada. No response what so ever. They could have at least said they would look into they slow service or whatever. So since they are a chain and could care less about customer service  I will not be back! They only got 2 stars because the fish and chips were good on our 1st visit.. If you have 4 hours for lunch  check them out. Otherwise go to the one in Tacoma  had a better experience there.
Andrew A.,Tacoma  WA,0,18,1,7/18/2014,5.0,First time here. Ordered a burger and a beer. Both were delicious. Our server Paisley was awesome. Very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. I will be coming back especially if she's gonna be our waitress.
John D.,Puyallup  WA,1,16,,10/29/2014,3.0,Food is fair. Pretty pricy and not too many different options. Would like to see a bigger burger list with spicier burgers. Lunch is the best deal. Chicken tacos are to die for. Dine in or carry out.
Mark S.,Puyallup  WA,0,5,,9/8/2015,1.0,My wife and myself along with my daughter  her husband and two Grandkids  1 1/2 and 6 years old  went to our local BJ's on 9/6/15 at aprox. 7:00 and were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. The kids were rather excited and rambunctious so we patiently waited outside so as not to bother other patrons also waiting inside. After approximately a half hour we inquired how much longer our wait would be and were told by two very pleasant and empathetic hostesses that they were working on it. After another 15 minutes  with the little ones being very hungry  we again inquired how long our wait might be. We were told that some patrons were occupying their table for 2 hours but we were first on the wait list. AFTER AN HOUR WAIT  we were finally called for a table! We were seated in the back half of the restaurant and were surprised to see that about 80% of this area had open tables!!! Our server  Tony  was effusively pleasant and took our drink orders. We asked him if we could speak to the manager. The manager on duty came to our table and we proceeded to tell him how long we had waited and asked why we hadn't been seated much earlier in the back area that had so many tables open. He went on to explain that  being Sunday night  they usually don't expect to be as busy as they were and suggested a shortage of waitstaff to cover the whole restaurant. He also offered to buy us all desert as compensation. The service we received from Tony was abysmal! My son-in-law ordered a burger without tomatoes. It arrived with them! My Grandson asked for applesauce with his meal and instead got fries! My wife ordered a side of fries and never received them! We were NEVER asked if we needed drink refills and had to ask for them after the meal was over! The bills were split and items were mixed up on the bills! Even the gratis deserts were screwed up with two of them denied because they were out of Peanut Butter Pazookies. And my Grandson received his sundae without the cherry on top! Everyone  especially a 6 year old knows that the cherry is what makes the sundae!!! The service was so painfully  frustratingly slow that we didn't end up leaving the restaurant until 9:30!! This was way past the baby's intended bed time and she actually ended up falling asleep in her high chair! While the manager tried to compensate us for the extremely long wait time for a table  this was before insult was added to injury with the incredibly slow service! Worst dining out experience I've ever had!!!
Stephanie H.,Tacoma  WA,29,6,,6/19/2014,5.0,My husband and I love this place. The pizza here beats any other place. We recently had our Anniversary and decided to have lunch here. The Baked Beignet is Amazing. I'll be ordering 2 next time so I don't have to share. I love being a BJ's premier member.
Jerry J.,Puyallup  WA,30,19,8,6/12/2014,3.0,Food is good and a fair value. The beer selection is good  there are several beers on the menu that are not available. The service leaves something to be desired.
Coryn S.,Puyallup  WA,0,12,3,4/7/2013,2.0,I was hesitant to write a review because the place JUST opened about 1 week ago but I feel the wait staff needs major improvements. For one  there were SO many staff members it was crazy! We had a total of 4 or 5 waiters/waitresses come to our table alone and none of them were communicating with each other on if/when we had ordered our drinks or our food. We were asked for our ID's twice. We were never offered water! We had to ask for napkins. Food came out warm  not hot. They asked us if we were aware of their points card. They explained that you receive 1 point per dollar spent so we asked them to sign us up. NEVER got the card. After spending $78 there on food and drinks  it would have been nice to have those points credited. We may go back once the place has settled in more and the wait staff knows their left hand from their right.
Lindzie K.,Santa Cruz  CA,0,15,2,10/6/2013,1.0,Worst food and lemon drop ever. I mean horrible. Go to the Ram or Olive Garden if you want big chain restaurant food. Shoot even any fast food place would be better. Yuck. Zookies are way to sugary and have the texture of raw cookie dough. Lemon drop is watered down vodka with a sugar rim. I mean the drink was damn near transparent.
L M.,Puyallup  WA,14,6,,5/2/2013,1.0,This place is a joke. It was slow so we expected to have at least decent service. We got the worst service. Everything we wanted they didn't have  so they had to come back to our table repeatedly to let us know we had to reorder. Never again.
Sarah K.,Tacoma  WA,56,15,1,5/16/2013,1.0,One star is being kind! My friend and I got to bjs and told we would have a 15 minute wait. 30 minutes later we were sat. Our waitress took our drink and appetizer order.. came back 10 minutes later with our drinks. 10 minutes later she came and took our main order. Over 30 minutes later we finally received our appetizer  cheesy bacon potato skins. Needless to say there was barely any bacon or cheese on them. Our waitress came to our table many times to apologize for the wait at the same time neglecting to bring us new drinks that's had been sitting empty or removing the finished appetizer tray. Once our food finally arrived 45 minutes later my friends calizone was completely doughy. My salad was completely caked in seasoning where I couldn't even see the lettuce. Needless to say worst restaurant experience I have EVER had!!! They need a whole new staff and management! !!! We went to red robin next door and recieved excellent service and food that was prepared correctly I wouldn't waste your time with bjs.
Stephanie K.,Puyallup  WA,0,2,,4/24/2013,1.0,Worst service I have ever experienced. Water not brought to entire table  drinks took forever or were wrong  salads that never showed up. Took forever to pay. Food was ok but after waiting that long  who really cares?
Jessica L.,Puyallup  WA,0,7,,5/4/2013,5.0,So we went in tonight. Friday night. And we had amazing service  food and drinks! I don't know why people are being so hard on reviews?? They are still a brand new restaurant! We will be going back soon :)
Jon T.,Tacoma  WA,9,232,2,6/27/2013,3.0,"In my opinion  you generally know what you are getting into with a Restaurant like BJ\'s. Brewhouse as a name is somewhat of a misnomer. They ""contract"" out their brewing operations to I think two or three companies. As a whole though  you could do a lot worse. Food is fairly consistent  although on occassion we find some variances on some of our favorite dishes between Tacoma  Puyallup  Tukwila  and others that we may visit. Things like the fish and chips and baked potato can vary based on our experience. While I appreciate the selection of beer  it is disappointing that the Happy Hour pricing is only available in the bar area. This unfortunately limits some clientel because of that limitation from having appetizers and drinks at a discount. The parking spaces at this location are terribly narrow. I suggest parking closer to the ""road"" that goes through the mall. You may find a little more room to open your door.Much of the negative comments on this particular location seem to have ironed out over the past several weeks since opening. If you had a bad experience in the weeks immediately after opening  it may be worth a second look.I do find all the Stalinist artwork a little amusing. But so long as they continue to have a good beer selection they could put Kim Jung Il on the wall and I probably wouldn\'t care."
David B.,Spanaway  WA,6,77,3,9/28/2013,1.0,"I stopped in for the first time. I believe this particular restaurant recently opened. As other reviewers have noted  I too was expecting the same quality as the Tacoma location. I was disappointed. The service was good but the portion size was very weak to say the least. Perhaps  there is a kitchen manager in the back obsessed with portion control. I ordered the lunch ""special"" which was a black and blue flatbread and a salad. With very few shreds of lettuce I noted a limp and damaged leaf. This ""salad"" looked more like a garnish and the manager of this place should be ashamed. The flatbread was tasty but again  very skimp on portion and arrived more as a light appetizer than a meal. I paid my tab of nearly $20 and left hungry. I went down the road to Applebee\'s and had half off food and drinks. I ordered a double margarita there to put the bad B.J\'s experience behind me. If anyone is thinking of visiting this location  you are warned. Take the trip to Tacoma if you are thinking about sampling the food."
Nik S.,Puyallup  WA,0,4,,7/19/2013,1.0,"It looked busy  but we waited less than 10 minutes for seating. The waitress came to our table and told us that since they have a large menu  she will come back to take our order. I told her I was ready to order drinks now and her attitude changed to one of like I was inconveniencing her. She brought the drinks 15 minutes later and took our order. I asked for mushrooms appetizer  a baked potato  hamburger  and a veggie pizza to go. After what seemed forever  the pizza in a box was brought to our table. I explained to the different server that brought it out that I was hoping to get the take-out after eating the main meal.  The original server told me that I did not specify that I wanted the take-out after the meal  but she will send it back to the kitchen for them to keep warm. I asked her where she expected me to store the pizza while I was eating because the table was so small. We waited again. Then our appetizer and meal came out together. I told yet another server that I thought traditionally the appetizer would come before the meal and she told me that the appetizer was written on the same paper as the main meal. When I finally saw the original server  I asked for some ketchup to which she gleefully said ""Sure!"" and went to the back register area (right behind our booth) and talked to her coworkers for 10 minutes before coming back to our table and snatching the ketchup from the table across from us and setting it down hard on our table. I don\'t know what I did to this server for her to act in this manner."
