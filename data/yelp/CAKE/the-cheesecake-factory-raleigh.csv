Leslie K.,"Raleigh, NC",1,4,3,5.0,7/20/2016,"Went in with a friend a week ago for lunch. We had a short dark haired waitress named Kelly. She was amazing. Had awesome recommendations, great attitude, was fun, and efficient.  I frequent there for drinks after work and it's always great.  But this experience ranks high on my list of service all over! Good hire Cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=80
Lissy K.,"Lynchburg, VA",9,26,14,2.0,4/8/2015,"My first time at Cheesecake Factory. I had the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake. It was OK. Definitely not worth the prices they are charging. I make better desserts at home.  I ordered the Pineapple Upside Cake Cheesecake originally, but later was told they were out of that one. Maybe that one would've been better....... Mostly it seems you pay for their rental space at the mall. It is enormous and decorated very fancy. Probably won't be back for a very long time. Not really impressed. I will someday give it another chance if I'm with someone who wants to go there. I never give up on a place based on one visit alone, but I am not racing back for mediocre dessert at sky high prices!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=80
Crystal C.,"Cary, NC",0,42,1,2.0,8/21/2016,"Ordered take-out to take back to work with me. I ordered the turkey sandwich with only cheese and lettuce. Get back to work at they had literally only put cheese and lettuce on my sandwich. No meat at all. I called the manager and told her I didn't have time to go back there and pick up another meal. She offered to have a gift card mailed to me. I told her that was fine. It has been two months, still no card.

Brie B.,"Raleigh, NC",27,117,137,1.0,3/11/2015,I am basing my review on my takeout experience and solely on the cheesecake  First off. I called and was told I needed to talk to the bakery. They transferred me to the bakery which then let the phone ring for a few minutes. After no answer I called back and was told I must come in to get my dessert since they do not take orders over the phone. They said I would be in and out. Ok. Cool. Whatever. I go and I'm waiting behind 4 waiters who are ordering cheesecake for their tables. The staff working the bakery seemed unbothered and the waiters were in no particular rush. After waiting 10 minutes and listening to their after work plans someone noticed me and took my order. 5 minutes later I was handed my slice of cheese cake that was sitting in the display window. I paid my $8 and went on my way. I got the red velvet cheesecake. One word ; Yuck  It was so bland with the WORST aftertaste. No creaminess no cheesecake flavor. Just gross chemical flavor. My whipped cream tasted better. Immediately my cheesecake went in the trash and I went to Walmart who's cheese cake was 100 times better. If this is how their signature dish tastes I will pass on the food at TCF.  Thanks for leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Literally.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=80
Anyssa M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",47,12,,2.0,6/26/2016,"After all the hype surrounding this place I was extremely disappointed.  Stick with the cheesecake. We ate lunch, so I'm not sure how that typically stacks up against their usual dinner menu, but the portions were disappointing and very expensive. The cheesecake was good but our entrees were pretty bland. I believe I could have gotten the same food (aside from the cheesecake) anywhere else at a higher quality and lower price.  I would recommend this place only if you're looking for desert after eating somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=80
Xiomara L.,"Pikeville, NC",8,7,13,3.0,9/6/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, after today, I am not sure if the drive is worth the price anymore.  First I will say the food was good. We all enjoyed our dishes. Next the wait time was acceptable, they told us 35-40 min and were seated in about 20-25. There is no call ahead seating.  The service from the sever was not what I would expect.  We left 15% tip and had she been better, would have left her more. She was very bland when taking our order, or coming back to make sure we had what we needed. There were long periods before we saw her again, which was unacceptable. It was as if she was trying to get through the day.   The bathroom was semi clean, there were paper towels all over the floor upon entering the bathroom and be careful walking to the bathroom or out the restaurant because there were a few times I almost slipped from how slippery the floor was.

Luke S.,"Binghamton, NY",20,91,94,5.0,3/19/2016,"This chain always impresses me.  The atmosphere and service are so consistent across each location.   The decor has a higher end feel and the pricing is in the higher side, but it is worth it.   The food...is GREAT.  Everything.  I have not had a meal I thought was just OK.  Lots of choices and items you normally wouldn't find on other menus.   This location is connected to the mall so you can shop then eat or eat then shop.   The cheesecake is Great.  My kids, wife and I love it.  Best you will have and all the flavor safe unique.  It is pricey but portions are plentiful.  You can easily split 1 piece of cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=80

Michelle B.,"Charlotte, NC",198,638,618,5.0,12/28/2014,"I enjoyed my visit to the restaurant.  Two of us arrived just before the standard dinner hour and were able to be seated within approx. 15 minutes. Our server was fabulous and efficient!  I was pleasantly surprised by the new (for me) skinnylicious menu items.  After all, I had not visited this chain because of the overly large servings of food that encourage you to needlessly stuff your face.  I enjoyed the skinnylicious salmon with asparagus and carrots.  The meal arrived fairly quickly and was delicious!  These menu options are an acceptable size for a normal serving.  This is preferred esp. when away from home and you cannot store leftovers. The price was right, dinner was great, and I left very pleased.

Brittany G.,"Raleigh, NC",176,350,230,3.0,2/21/2015,"Everything is huge here. Even the salads are gigantic mountains of lettuce and toppings. That being said, if you like large portions then you'll really enjoy The Cheesecake Factory. If you favor quality over quantity then it's a bit more hit or miss. Some items, even though they're huge, are actually very good. As bad as they are for me (think 2000+ calories for an entree size!), I really do enjoy the pasta dishes here. But that being said the majority of the dishes on the insanely huge menu are just kinda 'meh'. Lots of frozen and overly processed items with only a handful of standout dishes on a menu that has to be 100+ strong....Seriously. The menu is a book here...Like 15 pages or more. It's kinda overkill.  A couple pros: The design of the Crabtree location is pretty cool. It reminds me of being on a cruise ship or a casino. Also the free bread is pretty good. They give you lots (maaan how many calories have I consumed so far??) and it's often warm. Finally for as insanely busy as this place is the service is very good! Drinks stay filled and the wait staff is incredibly knowledgeable about a seemingly impossible to memorize menu. Kudos! Ironically I have never tried the cheesecake from here, but i've heard good things about it..I'd be more inclined to come in here for dessert and skip dinner all together next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=80

Even paying the check took forever. Omg it was painfully slow.  Our server was very nice, but not attentive.  There were tons of wait staff working and I had to send back a dirty bread plate, so I'm not sure how stud is really getting done?  We asked for to go boxes that had to be asked for again because the first person didn't bring them.  Obviously some corners are being cut.  But thank God my food was delicious as hell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=80

Sasha R.,"Raleigh, NC",37,13,4,1.0,8/16/2017,"Came here about a week ago, our server had an attitude of indifference; I assume this is because she assumed my friends and i would live up to the stereotype of giving a bad tip because were teenagers. We watched our server greet her other tables in her section with enthusiasm and saw her check on them constantly, while walking by our table and barely checking on us or asking how our meal was. At the end of our meal, she sat down our checkbooks and walked off without a 'thank you' or 'have a good night'. The service was utterly disappointing.  Food was mediocre, i got the veggie burger.

Michelle M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1391,235,4144,2.0,3/20/2016,"Came on a Saturday after some shopping at the mall. We arrived between 12:30-1 pm. There were groups of people in the entrance and waiting area, so I knew we would have some wait time. When I asked about the wait time for two, the Hostess said it would be about 15 minutes. Not bad with all these people standing around waiting, so I had them put my name down and they gave me a number. I should've known that it would be much longer than 15 minutes! After about 45 minutes of waiting, we went back up to ask and they told us it would be probably another 15 minutes before we were seated. I should've just left at that time, but had been craving some cheesecake. After waiting for 1  1/2 hours, we were finally seated. It didn't take our waitress long to come over and take our drink order. To keep things simple, we just asked for water with lemon.  While we went over the menu our waitress brought our water along with the complimentary bread and butter. I was starving, so I pretty much ate all the bread..lol. I decided on the Spicy chicken sandwich with the side of fries and my guest got the Factory burger and fries. We waited probably 15 minutes before our food came out. Not bad considering this place was packed!! Not sure if it was because of how busy this place was or if it's the norm here, but I didn't find the food that great. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory, but the food just didn't stand up to the quality that I'm used to back in Vegas or SoCal. My guest said their burger was very dry and the sandwich as a whole was dry and didn't have much taste to it.  After we were done eating, we just decided to order cheesecake to go. Paid for our food and left after being there for almost 4 hours. Never again will I ever go to this location on the weekends. The wait time is just so bad with all the people that come here. The best part of our visit was our waitress.

S. Elizabeth C.,"Charlotte, NC",131,75,47,5.0,5/3/2017,The food at the Cheesecake Factory is always good. We are around 3pm for a late lunch/early dinner passing through town and all of our food was good. The bartender was also very nice and we got cheesecake to go and even a day later it was great. Unfortunately the beer we were drinking needed a new tap and was a little foamy but the waiter gave us one on the house when he was fixing the tap. I totally got sprayed with beer but honestly it was just funny because the bartender was so apologetic.

Many dishes from many cultures as well as low calorie options. The meal is kind of pricey but the portion sizes are GIANT. This makes the check a bit more bearable. Nothing I've ever tried (with the exception of the cheesecake) will change your life. I've never had a meal that would make you slap yo' momma but I've never had a bad experience.

Wow, the restaurant was gorgeous, breath takingly beautiful. Recessed ceilings with alfresco plantings, Amber scones glowed gently, giving a warm, romantic feel but the ceilings where chapel high so it made for a grand feeling. They had a lovely patio and a nice night, so we sat outside. We ordered the Godiva Chocolate, White chocolate raspberry and tirimsu cheesecakes...I don't think I ever had better cheesecake in my life! I've always wanted to just go the for a dessert date and I had a blast with my daughter. The food was pricey but perfect for a special occasion, like my birthday a week ago. I would recommended reservations, if they take them. It was packed on a regular Thursday night!! Definitely fun and worth it, if you like sweets!

Aly M.,"Morrisville, NC",0,10,,1.0,4/8/2017,"tl;dr The food was good, as per most Cheesecake Factories but DAMN, management/servers were extremely unprofessional dealing with scheduling. I went with a few friends on a Friday evening. It was super packed and the wait was 30-40 mins which was fine and anticipated since they don't accept reservations. Food was the standard quality that you can expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  Honestly, the service was pretty good throughout the meal, they even brought bananas and stuff out for my 2-year old (odd and unexpected but pleasant, I suppose). The service wasn't super quick but our group didn't mind because we were all chatting.  The bad part came after we had paid for our food and were on the tail end of the desserts that we had ordered. As it turned out, they were getting ready for a large party coming in. That's fine and all and we would have been happy to get up and leave IF THEY HAD TOLD US. But instead, all the servers just stood and stared. And the icing on the cake was when our server stormed past us and huffed, ""WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL *THEY* LEAVE!"" That, plus our server's pretty obvious fake-nice act throughout our meal plus that staged and obvious attempt at guilting us out of our seats, pushed me over the edge. So I went and spoke to the manager, just to let them know that they should have handled the situation a little bit better. Now I knew that it's not going to change anything but dang people, get your acts together.  Oh, LOL, and I guess the hostesses and servers were so unprofessional that they let one of the ladies in the big group come up to us and ask if we could leave.  Cheesecake Factory, word to the wise, you should have just explained to us the situation and we would have understood and wrapped up and left.  I know my review isn't going to change if you go there, hell, I love it so I'm still gonna go.

I've had it before where it was too hot to consume.  I'm usually too full to even have dessert so it's always take out for a slice of cheesecake. The variety is amazing and is always a hit.

A little disappointed with the to-go at this location however. I called my order in and was quoted a 20 minute wait time. It's going on 40 minutes now and I'm still standing here amongst the crowd of people waiting. I see there's two cash registers at the counter, however, only one person is ringing up orders and bagging. In addition to that, there are employees standing at the end of the counter chit chatting and laughing. Not a very efficient use of equipment or labor.  Having been in the management aspect of the food service industry for many years, I can say that utilizing one of those ""stand arounders"", either having them man the register or as a runner bringing out orders, would help significantly increase the wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=120

Coley F.,"Raleigh, NC",0,18,,2.0,4/30/2016,"This review is based solely on our experience of ordering cheesecake to go.   We ate dinner elsewhere in the mall and headed to the Cheesecake factory to buy 2 slices of cheesecake to go.  We arrived at 5:45.  The entire entrance and lobby were full of people.    We headed straight for the cheesecake counter and got in line.  Short story: we didn't leave until 6:15 (a full 30 minutes). Long story:  Their system is inefficient and chaotic.  They are preparing to-go dessert and dine-in dessert orders all in the same small space.  Once you get through the line and finally order (and pay), you don't really realize you're in for such a long wait.  The cashier asks for your name, which they'll call out once your order is ready.  However, the lobby is super crowded, and there were dozens of other people waiting for their to-go cheesecakes.  As such, its hard to get close enough to hear your name.  Regardless, waiting for anything more than 5 minutes is unacceptable.  The cheesecake is good, but its not the best dessert in Raleigh. I'd never wait that long again.  If we hadn't already paid ($17 plus tip for 2 slices), we would have left.  But of course, once you pay, you're stuck waiting.  It's not like you could even make it back to the register to ask for a refund without waiting in line for 10 minutes all over again.   Another note: people in the lobby commented that they'd been waiting for 60-90 minutes.  That means these people had been waiting since 4:30 or 5, which I would have thought was a ""safe"" time to expect little-to-no wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=120

Portions are huge (and should be for the price) but no matter when you go, you will have to wait between 15 minutes and hours for a table. If this restaurant were closer, parking was more available, and it was less crowded, I'd go much more often. There have been many times we went here only to find no parking and/or an extremely long wait time, so usually we just don't go anymore except when I have that extra-special craving for my favorite dish and am willing to wait to be seated. Since it's always so crowded, servers tend to be overworked and you  won't be able to easily flag down your server for soda refills or whatever. Why don't they open another one in Wake Forest ?

The server acted like he was in a huge rush from the moment we were seated. He didn't really care about providing any kind of hospitality, approachability, or genuine service. We may as well have been cattle waiting for our number. The dish I originally wanted was vaguely ""not available"" tonight. I guess they had to wait to finish harvesting their own mushrooms from the garden out back? Or perhaps fermenting their own handcrafted fontina cheese? There's really a plethora of things that could prevent stuffed mushrooms from being a ""thing"" any given night.

He stated the cheesecake cutter  would not cut the cheesecake in half because that would ruin the presentation.  WHAT?!

I think some Cheesecake locations offer $5 cocktails during happy hour, but of course you can't do that in NC. Wine/cocktails were slightly pricey - I ordered a pineapple moscow mule and it was a great drink but I think it cost me $10. House wine started at $8.50. Two apps, two cocktails = $31.25.

Mage L.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,280,590,4.0,5/18/2011,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times around the country.  I've tried many of the entrees, and most of the time, I came away thinking the prices were too high, the portions were too big, and the food was just mediocre.  Based on a coworker's recommendation, I tried the Miso Salmon, and I've stuck with that ever since.  It's simply a reliable, good, reasonably priced entree that's consistent at every Cheesecake Factory I've been to. On this particular visit, I was in a group of 7 coworkers.  I already knew Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, so I made sure we all got there before noon on a Wednesday.  Lucky for us, the lunch crowd hadn't hit yet, so we were able to get a table without waiting. The service was a bit slow for lunch, but I expect with 7 different entrees it's hard to get them all prepared quickly.  The bread was delicious as usual, and was a good snack while waiting for food.  2 of my coworkers also ordered the miso salmon on my recommendation, and liked it as much as I did.  Another coworker ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, which I've had before and they are delicious.  My only problem with the lettuce wraps is they're messy to eat, especially when you're eating in front of other people you work with.  If the lettuce wraps were already prepared by the staff in nice little tightly wrapped leaves, I would probably get them more often.  But my lettuce would always break or drip sauces and fillings all over. For cheesecake I ordered the Kahlua/chocolate one.  It was pretty good, but I can make a better cheesecake at home for less than $7.  I've had some of the other kinds in the past, and none are bad.  None really ""wow"" me either though. We got in and out of Cheesecake Factory with a group of 7 in about an hour and a half, which isn't bad.  The server was always attentive throughout the meal, and got us our individual checks without any mix-ups.  They put the extra 18% on our checks, which is fine by me.  The server would have gotten 2% more from me since I normally tip 20%, but alas, when they pre-add the tip they don't give you another tip line to write on.  His loss. I'll probably go again with coworkers in the future, since it's a place that people can easily agree on.  I think if choosing between restaurants in Crabtree though, I would probably pick PF Chang's or Red Monkey Tavern over Cheesecake Factory.  There's just so many new and exciting entrees to try at other restaurants, whereas at Cheesecake Factory I feel like I'm stuck on the Miso Salmon simply because I've been so disappointed in the past when I've tried the other entrees there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=180

What I normally love about TCF is getting an entire cheesecake to take home and celebrate the birthday we were at the restaurant for to begin with.  For some reason it's much easier to enjoy the dessert at home, and the lemon cream raspberry was a perfect selection.

K S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,1.0,8/18/2015,"I have family that work at Crabtree so we have gone to Cheesecake Factory a number of times. This occasion was my sister's mother-in-law's birthday celebration. A very sweet 76 year old woman who was accompanied by 'Sister' another very sweet elderly lady. We arrived at 2:25pm on a Sunday afternoon, expecting a wait of course. We were told a 25 minute wait for a table. All right thats acceptable. After 50 minutes of waiting in an overheated hallway I went up to ask how much longer it will be. Was told rather rudely that it will be an additional 15 minutes since we had the audacity to have 7 people in our party. Now, I've worked in restaurants before, happen to have owned one in the past. And letting my eyes wander around the restaurant I saw at least two tables that could accommodate a slightly larger than regular party of 7..both tables were empty and reset. No one was being shown to them and they remained empty the 5 minutes or so it took for me to get the attention of the hostess. Finally after 15 more minutes we were called to the hostess stand where were subjected to standing around (with 2 older women over 75) with I would guess part of another large party for at least 5 more minutes while we waited for someone (not a hostess) to show us to a 'table' which ended up being a cramped booth really meant for 4 people (perhaps 6 in a crunch) with a chair thrown at the end of it blocking a narrow passageway.  There were two other same sized booths completely empty by the way..right next to the one we had just been sat at. My husband had the misfortune of getting the chair at the end of the booth and was constantly being bumped into by passing wait staff. Let me round it up and say that the wait for a table exceeded an hour. Our order was taken promptly enough, my unsweet tea was refilled with sweet tea (absolutely hate that)  and we proceeded to wait an additional 50 minutes for 5 salads , a hamburger,and a dried out chicken dish. Our waiter was replaced mid way through our service because obviously we went from being lunch customers to dinner, since it now was after 4:00pm. My husband had to take his salad to go because the wait was so long and he had to return to work. We all ordered cheesecake and they sang a happy birthday..except my cheesecake did not come out with the others. By the time it did everyone else in the party was finished and ready for the checks and to get the heck out of there. I asked for it to go. From start to finish, the whole unpleasant experience lasted almost 3 uncomfortable hours.  Unfortunately, I will not be coming back. Its been a tradition to take the older members of our family there to celebrate their birthdays. But I was in a state of discomfort after waiting over an hour for a table, being crammed in an uncomfortable booth for almost an additional 2 hours..I can only just imagine how very uncomfortable those two ladies were at the end of the meal. They were too polite to complain. I fortunately do not suffer the same malady. Hey Cheesecake...you need to hire a competent and time conscious hostess, you need to be better organized, and have a quicker turn around. You need to train your staff better on a whole. I had your waitress' shirt sleeve in my meal at least a half dozen times. Horrendous. This restaurant cannot handle parties over 4.

Erika B.,"Havelock, NC",31,1,,2.0,9/13/2015,"The food is always wonderful at the Cheesecake factory, and the only reason I go. I work at a restaurant as a waitress and I will say the costumer service I always receive at this restaurant is near to none. The service is always very bland and nothing great for what you'd expect at such an expensive, high quality restaurant.  I get better costumer service at a McDonald's honestly and that's pathetic. Last night I went to the Cheesecake factory for my birthday. As we sat on the patio it started to look like it was going to rain and began to sprinkle a little. A waiter we getting his table an umbrella. He asked us if we would like one, and we said yes.... he looked at us and said.. with an attitude  ""they are over their, you can go get one"".... for one I do not go to a restaurant and spend well over $100 to get my own umbrella. Not to mention he was very rude about it. We eventually got our table moved inside bc of the rain. We spoke to a manager about the issue and the Manger didn't seem to be too nterested nor care attitude all. Not sure if this was an hourly manager or what but by his very unprofessional attitude I would assume so. I think all of the employees seem to be very unprofessional. When the group of guys came to sing happy birthday to me at my table,  they made me feel miserable.  You could see the ""I hate my life"" all over there faces and they were walking off before they barely got the last word out. I just as much as any waitress understand that some days we just don't want to, but the phrase ""fake it till you make it"" applies in this job.  For them to go to work and make the money they do waiting tables, you'd think they'd work a little harder and be alot happier.  I deal with crazy, ridiculous people at my job and I always have a smile on my face and work hard for my money. They barely put a quarter of the effort I put in on a daily to all of my tables.

I've had their cheesecake before and liked it, but I will have to say that when it comes to the food, sticking with the eponymous dish was a good idea!  I ordered the eggplant sandwich, which included a LOT of cheese, roasted red peppers and aioli. Unfortunately, it was also served on a slightly sweet, fairly stale sesame seed burger bun which didn't do it any favours at all. I ended up eating the filling and leaving the bun behind. It wasn't bad, but it was rather oily and pretty salty, so much so that I felt a little queasy afterward. The sandwich came with Syscotastic fries, which were unremarkable. The spouse had the Evelyn's Pasta of penne with pine nuts, roasted vegetables and dried tomatoes; he pronounced it good, but also a lot more oily than expected. Service was average, but the music was absolutely dire and quite loud as well. Patio seating was nice, though, as the building kept things well shaded.

I must have had some birthday pixie dust sprinkled on me, because the two most recent visits (on a Saturday afternoon and a Tuesday afternoon), involved less than a 20 minute wait. Score 1! During both visits, the food was scrumptious, and the lunch portions are always huge - so if you are visiting before 5, and see something on the lunch menu that you like - get it. The lunch portions are huge, and cost less than the full-sized (and much bigger portions). I wasn't even able to finish my meal - especially after filling up on the bread that they offer. Score 2! On Saturday, I had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes - so much that I couldn't finish. I had to save room for the strawberry shortcake that my 6-year needed help with. I took my red velvet cheesecake to go. Mmm, mmm good!! On Tuesday, I had the succulent herb-crusted salmon, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Once again, the lunch portion was so much, that I had the rest for dinner.  Our server, Shannon, saw a birthday gift bag on our table, and at the end of our meal, brought me over an adorable glass cup of ice cream, whipped cream and fudge with sprinkles on top, complete with a glowing candle. Score 3! I thought that was super sweet, and a nice way to end an already awesome experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=180

Michael H.,"Baton Rouge, LA",59,577,89,1.0,10/27/2010,"So I get dragged to the Cheesecake Factory periodically for work functions, and I'm always left wondering what lucky soul gets paid to run the microwave in the kitchen. It's that bad. There's a plethora of great restaurants in Raleigh, and wasting time at this chain is time you'll never get back in your life. The menu is spiral bound, and it's chock full of advertising. I don't know about you, but when I flip through a menu I want to see lines of text with food descriptions and prices, and ONLY food descriptions and prices. It's rare for the food to arrive at a correct and consistent temperature; evidence of heat lamps and microwaves at work. This is especially bothersome when we're talking about simple staples like hamburgers and steaks. The ""banner"" cheesecakes - the namesake of this restaurant and what should be its crown jewel - tastes like something out of a just-add-water box. I agree with the other reviewers who have suggested that the menu be cut in half (after they lose the advertising), and that they focus on doing the basics a lot better than they do. If you're into thick, yummy desserts and want to spend money at a place with real cooking and baking happening in a real kitchen, please head down the road a few miles to the Hayes Barton Cafe. For about the same money you'll get dinner and dessert that is light years ahead of this piffle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=180

Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1528,1580,361,3.0,11/23/2010,"This branch exemplifies the epitome of US Tourist Commercialism that Cheesecake Factory is known for even more than other branches because of the sheer size of the place.   I didn't want to go in at first because I usually hate chains and was really daunted by the Voldemort-like evil radiating from this particular location.  But I was on vacay...the folks told me there was a CF...and I couldn't stop jonesin' for the Reese's PB Choco Cheesecake.   So I did a drive-by run-in.   The place was way too darkly lit to see if it was actually clean.  But the servers seemed friendly, the reps behind the dessert counter were quite nice, and the portions were far larger than I've ever seen at a CF (which makes up for the prices, which are comparable to NYC Times Square). The last time I had CF was about 5 years ago.  When I opened my container I noticed that CF has changed the ratio of cake to cheesecake on the Reese's dessert.  But it worked nicely.   I'll probably be back next time I'm in Raleigh, at least for dessert, because I am weak :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=180

Our previous attempts ended unsuccessfully due to the ridiculous wait times but thankfully we were lucky to walk in on a Saturday night with only 10/15min wait. We ordered the deep fries macncheese which was sinfully delicious. We also ordered the soup of the day, baked potato soup, which was good but missing something to really take it over the top, maybe just a little more salt or a kick of something-hard to say. We ordered ribeye steak with mashed potatoes & onion rings. As well as a chicken & penne pasta dish. Honestly I didn't think the food was worth the price but the cheesecake is enough to make me come back again & again. For dessert we has the vanilla bean cheesecake which sounds very plain compared to their other items but it hit the spot.  The service was great (waitress was named Lindsey) & the atmosphere was warm & welcoming.

Amanda A.,"Knightdale, NC",113,275,186,3.0,1/28/2014,"Been there a few times and here is some highlights of my experience: Good: Like the bread and butter when you sit down.   Service is always good. Pastas always have a nice flavor and perfect amount of sauce. I like how if you just want to order dessert to go there is an area for that so you can get in and out. Portion sizes are large.  That being said the prices reflect it and normally I have to take food home and I would rather get and pay for smaller portions and eat it at one sitting. Bad: Menu is too large.  So many pages and options.  Three pages of appetizers alone.  Also all of the advertisements in the menu seems cheap.  The food is not cheap so do you have to subject your guests to pages of advertisements that surely you sold that space for? The veggie burger is downright gross.  I will admit it is hard to find a place with a good one but this was on the list of the worse ones I have ever had. I can't ding them on always being crowded - good for them!  But the tables, esp. in the bar area are so close that you have no privacy.  It is like you are almost sitting next to  a stranger. Loud.  Very loud.  Nothing intimate about the setting as you almost have to yell at each other to talk.  Nothing warm and inviting about the atmosphere.  Not relaxing. Fries are salty. Desserts are WAY overpriced.  I have had some very dry ones, too.  Lastly the Limonchello cake.  The cheesecakes are normally good but charging about $8 for a slice of anything is too much! I only go here when I am with someone who wants to.  The good is ok, a little on the pricy side and the atmosphere does not lend to making the dining experience enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=160
Carter C.,"Raleigh, NC",29,57,204,4.0,12/18/2011,"The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because it's crowded and loud because EVERYONE wants to go here, and for good reason.  The food is bangin! Aside from the wait, the worst part about this place is trying to make a decision about what to order!  The menu is freaking huge and full of choices that just SOUND great. We've ordered a big range of items, from the ""healthier"" side of things, down to the decadent.  The food has never disappointed us. For a drink I often get the strawberry lemonade.  I warning here, don't order this if you don't have a sweet tooth.  This drink is non-alchoholic, and delicious, but it's like sipping liquid sugar.  If the south was famous for lemonade instead of sweet tea, I'm pretty sure this is would be the signature drink. If I had to suggest something, the Fried Macaroni and Cheese would be a great start.  Great flavor in the cheese and the marinara sauce.  Make sure you have a friend to share with though, or this might as well be your meal.  The mac and cheese balls are sizable.  For dinner, try the gumbo, or the spicy jerk shrimp, or the garlic and basil angel hair pasta with shrimp. All so good.  In regards to their fish and chips, it was perfect.  If it's fried, The Cheesecake Factory is probably going to do it perfectly. For dessert, it's the Cheesecake Factory, dur.   There's tons of choices and they're all awesome. The downsides to this place are the crowd and the seating.  The atmosphere here is really nice, when it's not packed to the gills with people.  The place is big, and Cheesecake Factory leaves no inch unseated.  The booths are fine, but the tables can be small and cramped.  When it's full, the place is loud.  Be warned. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, the waits could be up to an hour.  The good news is, it's open till 12:30 on Saturdays.  Being able to get good food after 10pm is a rare thing in Raleigh, and the wait drops quickly after 10:30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=160

Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",799,1040,4152,4.0,10/15/2011,"Let me make sure I have this right...The Cheesecake Factory has added to their already extensive menu and the added items are called SkinnyLicious!?     True story.  And it's not some teeny tiny skimpy menu of unappealing selections.  No.  This is a menu of great sounding CHOICES.      Oh, and such choices include drinks as well.  Which is why I had to start with a Mojito for 150 calories.  Same old mojito I've had elsewhere only nice to know some calories were shaved off by using a sugar substitute.      Seriously, the new skinnylicious choices ALL looked so good that it was really hard for me to make my choice.  Add these to the main full book, and there's a lot to look at.  Thankfully our cute, young, friendly waitress brought their delicious non-skinny bread and butter to tide us over.  (sigh, am weak).   So, husband orders off the main menu...fish and chips. Torn between many items including the Asian Chicken salad, finally, I order the SkinnyLicious Vegetable Salad: ""Asparagus, Green Beans, Tomato, Cucumber, Roasted Beets, Apple, Edamame, Radicchio, Romaine and White Cheddar All Chopped with SkinnyLicious™ Pomegranate Vinaigrette.""   Out came a giant bowl of chopped veggie greatness!  I do believe that someone either put a little Asian dressing on it by mistake, or used the same spoon...either way, one side of the salad had an Asian dressing flavor, which I'm not complaining about....it actually made me feel kinda like I got BOTH salads I was interested in.  The salad was fresh, crunchy, full of flavor and absolutely HUGE.     Meanwhile, husband is chomping down on a giant serving of fish and chips and slaw.  Waitress was very busy and his tea wasn't always kept full, but I think he was charmed enough by her cute youthful friendliness that he didn't seem concerned.     By the way, all through our meal, we got to watch the thin, young gals next to us devour giant pasta and breaded chicken meals, followed by huge slices of decadent cheesecake. May their young tiny hearts jog in peace afterwards.  Anyway, I digress.   We both ended up needing take-out containers. My guess is most people leave with about half their meal. We both did.   Prices here aren't cheap, especially for drinks.  My mojito was $9.25 (they conveniently don't put alcohol prices on the menu, not a practice I'm fond of, but I could've asked too)...husband's plain iced black tea was $2.95.  Fish and Chips:  a hefty $16.50, and my salad was $9.95.    Total:  $41.65 before tip.  But that's okay, because it's WORTH IT!     Standing ovation Cheesecake Factory for your new SkinnyLicious Menu!  Now, do you mind moving to a less crowded, less-aggravating mall to get in and out of?  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=160

However, I've never reviewed the restaurant itself, and honestly I don't eat there often. Not because the food isn't good (it is) or because the service is bad (it isn't), simply because I really hate waiting in lines and this place is ALWAYS packed!  I went with four friends last Sunday and we had a great time. My girlfriend showed up 40 minutes early to secure us a table (praisetheLord) and we were able to sit right down and order drinks. I opted for the Strawberry Martini, which our server warned us ""packed a punch"", but it wasn't bad at all. Quite delicious and honestly sweet enough that the sugar rim was an unnecessary garnish. I did appreciate the giant strawberry on the rim though!  I had the Crispy Crab Bites as an appetizer (from their ""skinny"" menu) and the Turkey burger as my meal. I had requested sweet potato fries and it came out with normal fries, which our server Christopher quickly remedied. Looking at my check I don't see the upcharge for the sweet potato fries, so that was an unexpected bonus.  A lot of times turkey burgers are too obviously pre-formed patties, or they are overly dry. This one was fantastic, but it was almost too moist! It fell apart all over the place and I had to eat it with my fork as a kind of turkey-burger-scramble, but it was delicious nonetheless.  For an appetizer, entree, and two drinks, my tab was still under $50. Not bad for a night out at Southpoint.

This is not a place we go regularly, but whenever I do end up here, I never leave disappointed with my meal, and I don't even like cheesecake. We ate dinner here tonight after Josh received a gift card for Christmas. I ordered something new for me, the spicy chicken tacos. The plate came with four tacos that were stuffed full with spicy chicken, cilantro, tomatoes, cabbage, cheese, avocado and crema. They were served with rice and black beans which were also good. Josh got a chicken dish which resembled chicken piccata served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. His was even better than mine. My usual choice here is the Cajun Chicken Littles, which are your basic chicken tenders served with corn and mashed potatoes. However, I wanted to try something new tonight so I steered away from my normal choice. We did not get dessert and left with half of our food for lunch tomorrow. However, I have tried one of the chocolate layer cakes in the past, which was huge and so delicious. As I mentioned earlier, I do not like cheesecake so I can't say much about the cheesecake except that everyone I have eaten here with seems to love the variety of choices. The service here is generally very good. It can get very crowded (usually an hour or more wait, especially on the weekends). We got very lucky tonight and were amazingly seated right away (at 7 PM on a Wednesday night). Overall, this is a good spot to stop for lunch or dinner if you're at the mall. The menu is large enough to have an option to please anyone in your group and they now have a ""Skinny"" menu as well for (slightly) healthier options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=220

I really like the cheesecakes, the chili relleno burger, the chicken marsala, and a few other dishes. However, there is not enough space between the tables and I often feel cramped. Also, my order is frequently wrong and because of this I think I have had more free slices of cheesecake than ones I have paid for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=220
Jessica P.,"Asheville, NC",64,65,53,5.0,5/31/2011,"For me, this was as good as it gets.  For heaven's sake, I found my new favorite food.  No, not favorite meal at Cheesecake Factory -- favorite food/meal/scrumptious all-around dish I've ever set on my taste buds.   Take it from me - if you're a sushi and salad lover, you've got to try the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  It comes with two sauces, which I got both on the side to be safe.  They are to die for.  I couldn't get enough of them!  Also included on this lettuce-based salad is tomato, a big heap of ginger slices, and a side of wasabi.  I cut up everything into smaller pieces, including the tuna tataki, mixed it up as a typical tossed salad, and spread the sauces over top.  Delicious.   I've had my share of sushi eating, as I've been a long-time employee in 2 different Japanese Steakhouses.  To be honest, I was not expecting the quality to compare, but my expectations were greatly exceeded.  It wasn't as big as some of the cheaper (by only $2.00-3.00) salads on the menu, but very worth it. My boyfriend had the Cobb Salad and was equally impressed.  I had a bite and it was great, but an entirely different ball game.  If you're into a typical ranch/thousand island dressed salad, but a fantastic one, that is the one for you. The unlimited bread supply for the table was a great compliment to the salads.  We finished off our meal by splitting the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake.  Nothing but yummy goodness, but then again, I can't say I've ever had a bad piece of cheesecake from here. And one more plus to compliment them on -- though Crabtree mall closes at 9pm, the Cheesecake Factory stays open 'til 12:30am!  A perfect end to an evening of shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=220

Everyone here pretty much sum up about their services and their hospitality practices, so all I'm going to comment on are the food that I got. For the lunch I got the seared tuna tataki salad. Can't say that I have a salad quite like this, and that's neither a compliment nor complaint. They did their tataki right, the ""wasabi vinaigrette"" was inventive, and I honestly can't understand the avocado? to imitate sushi ingredient perhaps? It was an experience, let's just say that. For the dinner date I had the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. The fish was not terribly cooked, stayed in shape, but kind of lukewarm.

I went here yesterday after shopping at the mall and there was no wait surprisingly. The place was packed though. They sat my fiancée and I at this horrible table. It was part both and the other side chairs. It was so small, and uncomfortable. We had chicken sliders they were good and I thought it was a large appetizer (we got 4 of them). We also ordered a beer. The menu says what beers they have but no prices. I asked if they had any beer specials and my waiter said no we never have specials (rudely) and asked for my id. I would of never ordered the beers if I knew I would be paying 7.25 per glass! And the waiter asked if we wanted another one and never mentioned the cost. We ordered 4 beers and it end up costing as much as our appetizer and two entrees. For the entrees we got Alfredo which was very plain I did not eat most of it. The other entree was stuffed chicken tortillas. Most of the plate was filled with black beans, the pancakes that came with them were too sweet, too cornmeal tasting, and the tortillas were just okay. The floor was slippery so I mentioned it to a waitress passing by and she said it was from the grease they carry out from the kitchen and they have non slip shows so it doesn't bother them. I almost slipped and than I watched a woman shortly after almost do the same thing. They said they would clean the floor, they never did. I would go back for the cheesecake and that's it.

My most helpful tip for newcomers: GET HERE FAST AND PUT YOUR NAME IN FAST!!!!  When we eventually got a table, I took a look at the menu. The lines aren't the only big things at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge! There are probably 10 pages (not including ads) of food, drinks, and cheesecake! The menu is also a little weird. I wouldn't expect Shepard's Pie, Orange Chicken, and Bang Bang Chicken to be on the same menu, but at the Cheesecake Factory, that is the case. I ordered the chicken di pana. It is lightly breaded chicken breast served over a white wine butter sauce with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Here is what I received: 2 GIANT chicken breasts, 4 broccoli florets, and possibly 5 giant scoops of mashed potatoes. Portion sizes are huge. I'm glad I don't come here too often. Everything at the Cheesecake Factory tastes good. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were scrumptious. Surprisingly, the Shepard's Pie is delicious. I would definitely recommend the pork chop too.  You can't come to the Cheesecake Factory without their cheesecake. Their cheesecakes are amazing, all of them.

Miss V.,"Dallas, TX",5,99,20,4.0,1/28/2012,"This place is a favorite between me and my boyfriend. It's the only place I've ever seen him order a salad, and that being said, it's one of the rare places I will order a salad either because they are typically huge, and have a whole lot of toppings that make it very filling. A few things: 1. Sometimes, the salads are made a little bit differently depending on who's the chef, which means occasionally the salads are smaller than normal, or forgot an ingredient. The servers are awesome though and typically fix what they can although when we've gotten a much smaller salad neither one of us has wanted to be the piggie that exclaimed, ""hey! MORE salad in my trough! Don't be stingy!""  I mean, they already give us two baskets of the dark bread.  2. If you get something to go, I've noticed that the to-go portions are smaller than the in-house portions. (are you noticing a trend?) I mention this because typically the salads we get are two meals worth, so when we're paying $14-16 for a salad, we like to stretch it out. 3. I can't say I've ever had anything bad here. Get creative. I typically get the pear and endive salad, and add goat cheese and beets in lieu of chicken (there's sometimes an extra charge for the cheese.) Boyfriend digs the Southwestern (or is it the Barbeque Chicken?) I'm not a big fan of their veggie burger, but I have played around with another burger and had it on their fry bread, which is messy but delicious.  4. I've ordered several of their slices of cheesecake, and while they're solid, they're not so melt-my-little-grinchy-heart that I'm willing to shell out $7 for them except when I'm feeling especially magnanimous with my stomach.  5. Oh, and their tropical iced tea is really good and enough to make me want to go there tomorrow.  6. This place might not be the best for people with hearing aids. There's most often a din of some sort, which makes it great if you're needing a public place to trade nuclear armament design upgrades, but not so great if you've had a really tough day and don't want to be surrounded by the happy, materialistic cacophony of the Mall. p.s. Dear Waitstaff-- you all rock my socks off. At all of the Cheesecake Factories I've been to in several states, I've only had the rare off night with a server and never at this one. These guys and gals are professional, warm, and for the most part efficient (c'mon, they can't control the kitchen) with presenting the food or keeping stomach grumbles to a minimum with bread and refills.

Mai O.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,6,5,3.0,9/21/2015,"I finally went back to Cheesecake Factory when I was celebrating my sisters birthday this past weekend. I had been dying to go back bc I love me some Cheesecake Factory. My whole family party was about 10 and our wait was about 45 min on a Sunday evening which was fine. We were seated and we told our server that it was my sisters birthday so that they could do something for her. So we ordered and the food came in just in time since the bread was going fast and we had gotten to our second baskets of bread. What is it about their bread and butter?! Haha so good. Since the portions are so big a few of us shared dishes so that was perfect because we finished it. Soon after our plates were picked up we asked the waiter to already do the birthday thing so we could sing my sister happy birthday and give her her cards and present. However she did not do anything yet. We waited and she was nowhere to be found. We ended up just giving my sister her cards and gifts bc it was already a while. And we finally placed our dessert order bc she told us they can't do a birthday special thing for her unless we ordered dessert. I was shocked. It ruined the rest of our what happened to be a perfect dinner celebration. They finally sang happy birthday when the cheesecake came out but the night was basically ruined. On top of that after singing the song (which normally the bday celebrant blows the candle and makes a wish) she interrupted the moment to ask if we need anything else. It was just all kinds of wrong after that. So all in all the food and overall service was great but that last part was not. I can't remember a place that doesn't do something special for birthday occasions without needing a dessert order. I just didn't feel it make sense. Just this past May my family came to this restaurant for my mothers birthday to which they sang at the right time and gave my mom a free bday cake(I was not there).

Now for the kids - the kids menu offers sliders and chicken fingers and mac & cheese and a couple other items.  It is reasonably priced and has enough food for a growing boy.  You can get a ice cream sundae for $1 more and it's enough ice cream to give your kids stomach aches (not that you'd want to, my point is it's a lot of ice cream).   The service is great!  The place ambiance is great!  The food is great!

Joseph V.,"Henderson, NV",24,146,2,3.0,1/16/2011,"I had Cheesecake Factory on my mind today.  So, tonight for dinner, I decided to mosey over to the Crabtree Mall and have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. Wow, it kinda caught me off guard.  I think the whole town went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  It was PACKED on a Sunday evening.  I mean, it was more pack than a can of sardines pack.  In addition, the wait list and the lines were at least 20-30 people deep.  No way in heck I would be able to wait for a table and have dinner here.  In addition, it was way too noisy for my taste -- feels like I was in a subway train station... so much commotion. Decided instead to order and have it in the hotel (peace and quiet).  Frustrating thing about the menu is that it offers so much variety.  If you haven't been here before, you kinda get lost or sort of ""intimidated"" with the menu itself.  Personally, they need to find a way to simplify their menu.   I normally order the Pad Thai shrimp.  Unfortunately, they no longer have it as part of their menu.  Instead, for an appetizer, I ordered the Buffalo Hot Wings.  And, for the entree, I ordered their specialty item, Jambalaya Shrimp Spicy Pasta to go. The order took about 15 minutes to get ready (pretty quick).  So, I took the time to walk around the restaurant and visit the restroom.  Surprisingly, the restroom was a mess.  Because of the volume of people in the restaurant, the management team failed to check on the lavatory conditions.  Bad mark here. Anyways, when I finally got the meal, I headed back to the hotel for dinner.  Here are the meal results: a.  Buffalo Wings - nice and plump.  However, I did not care for the heavy saturated flour and sauce.  Would have preferred that they serve it as a ""naked"" wing with the sauce either marinated with the wing or on the side.  The flour was not that good. b.  Jambalaya Shrimp Pasta - I asked the sauce to be served on the side.  Usually, they lather the pasta in this sauce and it is a bit overwhelming.  So, being that it was on the side, I was able to apply as much as needed.  The pasta and veggie mix was very good.  Even better, the shrimp was tender and had a heck of a spicy kick to it.  I really enjoyed this entree. The total came to about $40 (buffalo wings, jambalaya shrimp, diet coke, and a small ""order-out"" tip). Here are my ratings: The meal was fair - Buffalo wings ~ 2.5 stars, Jambalya shrimp ~ 4.5 stars.   The price was a bit pricey ~ 2.5-3 stars.   The crowded atmosphere and restroom conditions ~ 2 stars Enjoy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=240

Donna B.,"Dallas, TX",117,567,404,3.0,7/27/2010,"Finally sat down for a meal in Cheesecake Factory, after years of having only cheesecake. The cheesecake, of course, gets five stars.  The rest of the establishment, however, well...I think this is one of those occasions when you run across a product that's done a really, really good PR job.  You know, one of those where you finally get the goods and wonder, ""What's all the hype about?"" or to make a really bad pun, ""All sizzle and no steak.""  Yes the cheesecake is worth the hype.  The rest of the restaurant, not so much.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good.  The menu is massive, probably more massive than it needs to be.  Let it be a hint to you that the menu has PAGE NUMBERS.  When was the last time you saw a restaurant menu so lengthy that it required page numbers?!  Once you wade through the many pages of appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees, steaks, seafood, etc. to choose something to eat, the food is good; I recommend asking for a box to take half of it home.  First of all, there's more food than you'll be able to eat, and secondly, you want to leave room for cheesecake.   Cheesecake Factory is one of the better eating spots at the mall, especially for those of us who don't want to go near the Food Court unless it's for something cold to drink.  Our wait to be seated was only five minutes and the service was good, although a bit slow a couple of times (they were busy).

Nancy H.,"Raleigh, NC",25,17,,3.0,6/20/2012,"It's an ok restaurant. The food is average, not memorable, the cheesecake is what I think people really go for. The wait for a table can be long, which is frustrating at times. The menu is way to long, I wish they would shorten their selection and stop trying to be something for everyone. It makes it difficult to order and maybe if they focused on a particular cuisine their quality of food would go up. There serving sizes are enormous, so I would recommend either sharing with someone or preparing to take half or more home with you. That being said, their cheesecake is pretty good. Aside from my own home-baked it is the only kind I have found that I like (although not quite as good as mine). Last time we went, we actually ate somewhere else and just stopped by to get cheesecake to go (I think that is the way I like to do this restaurant the most, avoids the long waits for tables, horribly designed menu etc.). The service is so-so. It is not a quiet place to eat, the decor is over the top (I think they were going for Italian renasaince) and parking can also be a problem since it is located at Crabtree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=240

My favorite--that I order time and time again--is the chocolate coconut cheesecake. So sinfully good. Other ones worth mentioning are the white chocolate macadamia nut, red velvet, and the Tuxedo. My husband and I enjoy sitting at the bar since we're usually forced to--this place is busy every second of every day it seems--and ordering a nice hot chocolate or coffee with a little whiskey to go with our slices. There's one chicken dish that is really good, and the fried artichoke hearts are amazing, but overall it's big, it's crowded, it's loud, it's kinda pricey.

Of course, I walked out with cheesecake in hand because its a sin to to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and NOT eat cheesecake! I ordered the Oreo Dream cheesecake, s'mores cheesecake, and lemon torte. While I didn't eat them all (you didn't think they were all for me did you?), I did try them all. The Oreo was a little overkill but perfect for my teenager. The s'mores was simple and sweet.

The food is always piping hot and very tasty. I've had the egg scramble, the omelette mentioned, the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus is my go-to. They also have some really good grilled spinach that you can sub for if you're not down with asparagus. I appreciate that tangy lemon butter sauce they pour over the plate with the grilled salmon meal. (And no, they don't cook the salmon to death here -- thank goodness! Though still, I always do try to remember to ask for it medium rare to medium as a safeguard.) The numerous flavors of cheesecake are exactly what I'm into, and I've tried almost every kind, including several of the seasonals. My go-to, however, is the TUXEDO cheesecake, with that vanilla mascarpone layer underneath the topmost chocolate layer, and a chocolate cake layer on the bottom. Whew!!! Heaven.

Told my mom and sister in the meantime to eat since their food was getting cold. Her tuna was over cooked and the crust wasn't crusty but soggy.   The only up side is that the cheesecake that I got to go was awesome, of cousrse let's hope that a restaurant named the Cheesecake Factory would get that right!!! My main issue is the excuse that it was all to blame on the kitchen. I saw some waitress' that could be a better job. And a manger that shouldn't have taken that long to come out and apologize  at my table.  I have worked in the restaurant business  and always hate that the kitchen gets blamed  for everything maybe if the menu wasn't soooo large the staff could have an easier time getting food out!  Also management has to be in command of the staff and it looked to me like they were clueless.  We were clued in that I wasn't the only one who wasn't get food.

Mom got the cheese crusted chicken w/pasta- very good the sauce was kinda tame for her but still yummy. Dad had gumbo-very good, a little spicy but that's how gumbo is right?! Waitress was great! Very energetic, even tho it was a busy day.  Had 3 cheesecakes to share that we took home cuz we had no room left. Adams cheesecake-peanut butter type- great!  Kaluah cheesecake-coffee type-OMG!

I don't like to eat my veggies but this ones really tasty. I don't know how ""healthy"" it is but I promise it's yummy and filling. Their cheesecakes are unbelievably delicious and creamy. They are also very heavy so the whole ""sharing is caring"" motto is definitely applicable here. My favorite so far has been the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake- give it a try!

Marie T.,"Raleigh, NC",28,172,48,4.0,1/15/2017,"The one thing you can count on with The Cheesecake Factory is consistency across the board, which helps when you're going to dine with really picky eaters. I feel there are enough amazing restaurants in the Triangle area to avoid chains, but if you're going to go to a chain, The Cheesecake Factory is a good bet. Their menu selection literally has something for everyone (for which I am eternally grateful for when dining with really picky people). Their coffee is solid, too. As far as desserts go (because let's be honest, dessert is the best course), their carrot cake is off the chain. I would seriously drive out of my way for their carrot cake. It is amazing!!!  Best carrot cake I've ever had, and I'm quite the travelled carrot cake eater. Their cheesecakes are all relatively solid (the red velvet is to die for!). Their strawberry shortcake dessert is unfortunately majorly lacking. Avoid this menu item...it's like chewing balloons with sugary sauce mixed in. On to the food! With the varied selection, obviously some things will be better than others because you can't do everything great, but all the entrees I've tried have been pretty solid. The shepherds pie can sometimes fall on the salty side when the kitchen is rushed, the corn fritters are the bomb, the pastas are always pretty good, and the little flatbread pizzas are wonderful. Service is a definite hit or miss. Some servers are excellent at this location and other servers appear to hate their job, the restaurant, and every patron that comes across their table. That's to be expected when a restaurant is this large and the price point is where it is. Unfortunately, due to the proximity to the mall, you can get some larger groups of kids hanging around just ordering drinks and one slice of cheesecake, which I'm sure does nothing to improve the server's mood.

Not a bad experience, and one I'd do again, but not one I'm in a hurry to get back to considering the myriad of other great restaurants Raleigh has to offer. My friend had a craving for Cheesecake Factory, so I figured what the hey, since I'd been years ago in Charlotte and thought it was ok. The wait on a Sunday evening was about 20 minutes around 6 PM. Service was fast and friendly, so no points off there. The seared tuna tataki salad was pretty good. Fresh ginger, ripe avocado, and tuna were delicious, not to mention a high point in a menu not friendly to the calorie-conscious. (I did not save room for dessert, sadly). If I had to name a downside, is that this dish, with an unsweetened tea, cost over $21 bucks (not including tip) and had to wait 20 minutes for. Though what I ordered was perfectly fine, I definitely knew I was paying more for decor/the franchise/etc, which is typical for more upscale chains like Maggiano's, California Pizza Kitchen, and Cheesecake Factory. rather than a novel culinary experience. Again, so many other great restaurants around Raleigh that offer more bang for the buck. Nonetheless, pretty good food if you're willing to pay and wait, and of course, a phenomenal selection of cheesecakes (the quality of which I cannot comment on since I passed).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=100

Jessica R.,"Raleigh, NC",1,5,,1.0,2/21/2016,"Let's just start with saying if I could do NO STARS I would. This has by far been the worst experience at any restaurant that I have ever been to. We walked into the Cheesecake Factory at 8:17 p.m. on Sunday February 21st. We were immediately greeted by a very kind gentleman in a blue shirt (who we thought was the manager) and the hostess. We put our name in for three people and were told that we had a fifteen minute wait. That was completely fine. When we were finally seated (which was not in the fifteen minute wait mark) we were greeted by our waitress. After all our food was ordered and brought to the table (which took 45 minutes!) my fiance had noticed that something he had specifically ordered not to have was on his food. Because of his allergy the food was sent back. In the meantime of waiting for his meal, my friend and I have completely finished ours. By the time we were ready for our checks our waitress mentioned the manager (who we HAVE NOT seen all night long) was offering us free cheesecake. We decided we didn't want to take advantage and asked to just speak to the manager to explain our situation. When the manager came over and introduced himself is when the REAL problem occurred!! The manager's name was PHIL. The second he came to our table there was instantly a rude vibe coming off from him. He asked us what our problem was and as we started to describe it he interrupted us with a sarcastic remark about the ""timing"" and continued with saying our problems were in fact not really problems. Phil then apparently decided he was done hearing us and stood up and said ""WHATEVER THE FOODS ON ME."" We were in COMPLETE shock. I have NEVER in my life been so disrespected EVER.

Viola W.,"Charlotte, NC",0,3,,1.0,4/8/2014,"I wouldn't even give this place one star if I could. My family and I went there on 04/05/2014 and had the worst time ever. We love cheesecake factory in Charlotte, NC, Virginia, and in DC where we have family as well. We went there to celebrate a birthday for my uncle who is one of the pillars of our family. First, the people here told my cousin that they don't take reservations when she called a week ahead of time and the day of in the morning when they opened, which is a lie, because again, we go there all the time and all of the cheesecake factories take reservations. So when the rest of the family got there which was 10 minutes later, we still had to wait 30 minutes. My family party was about 12-15 people, they tried to sit us down in two separate areas. I don't know what they were thinking. 6 people would sit on the far left side of the restaurant and the rest on the right side. We are celebrating a birthday at a restaurant for God's sake. Then the young lady in front that was seating individuals, with red long hair, had a very nasty attitude and was down right rude. Well my mother talked to her like she had some sense somewhere and informed her that we are here to patronize the restaurant. She didn't pay attention to us at all because we were of color, however, the individuals of white American decent were seated and handled in the utmost manner. NOT ACCEPTABLE. We actually know some of the board of trustees and partners as well as investors in the restaurant. Not to throw names around, but again, we go there almost once or twice a week, so this was horrible. Needless to say, the manager, a guy who seemed as though he had no clue of being a manager tried to seat us in two booths. Not only were we annoyed, we were furious. We just sat down to get the dinner over with vowing to never come back. We sat down in two booths that were back to back and the food was simply nasty and uneatable. Example, my sister and I had a steak, salmon, and shrimp dinner and I had salmon and the salmon was small like 2 inches long and 3 inches wide. The steak was hard, nasty, and not seasoned. We look over to the left of us and there was a reservation for a party of 20 full of teenagers and kids; but I thought you don't do reservations. The only positive to this place was the server. She was so friendly and we gave her a great tip! Cheesecake factory in Crabtree, please listen, many of your members who are somewhat invested in your company and patronize it have already sent a letter, phone calls, emails, and etc. to let them know how disgusted we were to have even been treated like that.

The recipes are always solid, they may not be super high quality, but they are always well prepared.

Melanie D.,"Mountain View, CA",41,203,1,3.0,2/3/2006,"The only time I ever go to the Cheesecake Factory is when my friend, Lisa, is in town.  It's our little thing - laugh a little, talk a little, eat a little.  We always try to save room for dessert (OBVIOUSLY!), so typically we eat an appetizer for our main  course.  I like the avacado egg rolls a lot, they are relatively light and come with a delicious sweet nutty sauce.   The few times I have ventured into full-fledged entree land, I was unimpressed although this could be because  1) I ordered fish tacos and they came loaded with red cabbage, which I completely hate. 2) The food is solidly made and delicious but can be overpriced. 3) It left me too full to enjoy dessert, my favorite part of any meal! If I order cheesecake, it's the ever-popular white chocolate raspberry or the Toblerone.  However, their cheesecake is extremely rich (as New York style cheesecake is) and I am not often in the mood for it.  Their other desserts are wonderful, such as their tiramisu and their ice cream sundaes.  Definitely save room if you order a non-cheesecake dessert:  they are filling and the portions are large.  The cheesecake slices can be buried under the two puffballs of whipped cream, which I think is part of the way they make the slice seem more exciting than it actually is. Also, another note, for a restaurant that goes for the upscale dining experience, it's very loud and crowded.  I would have expected something a bit more lowkey.  And since it's so new to the Triangle, the waits are disgustingly long at key hours. PROS:  Good food, great desserts, attentive wait staff. CONS:  Long waits at peak hours, overpriced, lots of heavy cream and calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh?start=280

We waited in the designated parking spots 15 minutes...no employees came out to acknowledge any customers/cars during that time.  (All spots were filled). Called their takeout number to  make certain they knew cars were waiting. It was almost another 15 minutes, and another car's order came out before ours, and they were the last vehicle to arrive. I didn't blame it on the poor girl who finally ran out with our orders, I blame it on poor management and poor staffing during busy times. Do not offer carry out if you cannot accommodate those customers in a timely manner. By the time we got home, we had soggy sandwiches. Watched one couple go in to grab their food themselves.

K M.,"Wake Forest, NC",0,18,,3.0,3/2/2013,"I am not overly impressed with the Cheesecake Factory. Don't get me wrong, if I was ordering just the cheesecake they would get high praise, but as a restaurant with a full menu for what you pay, you just do not get your money's worth. I think the menu is to big. After an hour wait, we were sat and it took the waiter about 20 minutes to deliver our drinks, a glass of wine, my drink a 7 and 7 and a few soft drinks. We ordered the appetizer, the Chicken Samosas, wafers wrapped with spicy chicken, served with a cilantro dipping sauce. It was pretty good. My wife had the meatloaf which she thought was pretty good. I had the Salisbury Chopped Steak with mashed potatoes. The food was good, but it did not wow me. In all honesty I think you can get the same quality food at a chain like Chili's or Applebees for 1/'2 the price. The money we spent at Cheesecake was not a dining experience. For the same amount we could have eaten at the Melting Pot and been wowed. The tuxedo cheese cake, chocolate mouse cheese cake was great.

When my husband looked up he noticed the glass salt shaker was actually broken at the bottom! Not knowing if I had broken glass in my pasta, the waiter apologized and took it back. I suppose a manager came out also and apologized for the mishap and said they were preparing me another meal. Great. I enjoyed a portion of it and the remainder was boxed so I could take it home along with my key lime cheesecake. My disappointment was in the fact that I wasn't offered anything other than an apology for potentially swallowing glass along with my pasta!

They have small plates if you want to try a few different things or you aren't really hungry.  They have a large number of dishes in general to choose from so everyone should be able to find something they like.  I also find that the portion sizes generally allow for me to take half home and have that meal again for lunch the next day. I find its a great value for the money. This is a great place to have dinner and also a great place to come just for dessert. Or take it all to go and enjoy it in the comfort if your own house.

Maryammalle P.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,35,16,3.0,7/31/2017,"Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory but my last experience was so below par of what my usual dining experience. I came in on Sunday around 12:50 and was told by the hostess who barely looked at me that the wait was an hour for 5. I didn't mind since it was national cheesecake day and I expected it. What I didn't like was the fact that she was a hostess but was not friendly at all. I'm sure she was just overwhelmed.  So we ended up walking around the mall for 35 minutes before heading back and as soon as we got back, our buzzer went off, awesome! The Asian girl that sat us was not very pleasant. She was rude in how she spoke to us. I had a stroller, my son is 5 months old. I had asked for a sling so I would be parking my stroller but it was how she spoke to me that got me. It wasn't friendly at all. I told her I would take just the car seat as long as they had the sling I requested. She said to park it near the bar and proceeded to rush me in while my friend parked my stroller. I told her I wanted to wait for my friend so we could walk in together. She seemed a little irritated. When we got to the table, no sling but it was a booth so I opted out since the car seat would fit into the booth with me and my 4 year old. Anyhow, I ended up asking my server for a sling to make it more comfortable. By the way, my server was awesome. Super nice and attentive. As we began to eat, the same Asian girl walked by to seat another family and this time, there was a man in a wheelchair so she needed more space and instead of asking us to move the sling, she TOLD us to move it out of the way for the man. She was rather rude and seemed irritated that we had a sling there. Luckily, I was nursing my son so he wasn't in the sling and we moved it somewhat under the table.  This girl is not meant to work in service. She's not very nice for a job that requires her to interact with people. I understand it was very crowded but you should still be courteous to all your patrons cause it's your job! She was just pushy and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, I love Cheesecake Factory and have always had a great experience but this last one was not good. The hostesses are the first impression of a restaurant. Someone really needs to talk to this girl. She looks young and inexperienced.

Seating at the restaurant is hit or miss. If seated in a round booth, you will have a much nicer experience than sitting in the bar area. The tables are just way too close to enjoy the experience.  The menu has always been pages and pages of options. So it's pretty much dependent on what you order.  This visit, I opted for a California guacamole salad. It was huge and no humanoid could eat this size portion in a single sitting. So, while the prices seem higher than normal, know that you will have leftovers!  The salad was way to heavy on the cilantro, I do like cilantro, but next time would opt out as that overpowered the other flavors of the dish.

I'm set to go to Cheesecake Factory for a birthday party in Charlotte this week, so I'll be getting actual cheesecake then and trying some other menu item.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh

The wait was 20minutes but we were seated within 10minutes. We the egg role sampler for an appetizer and it was amazing. The salmon egg role was amazing. I got me the southern fried chicken sandwich minis with a side of sweet potatoes fries and they came out hot and delicious. The fried chicken was well seasoned.  And you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting Cheesecake. I ordered a chocolate walnut Cheesecake and Oh my my my, was it delicious.

Jim E.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,"I brought my family out to dinner to celebrate my daughter being home from college in Massachusetts for the holidays. We arrive for dinner at around 7 PM, our food is bought out at 7:55, which is fine with drinks, bread and conversation. The only problem was that my meal, the chicken Parmesan ""pizza style"", did not come out. I am told it'll be right out, then I am told it was ""sold to someone else"" and they are re-making it and it would be out in 5 minutes. At 8:06 they offer to bring me some soup, so I say okay, might as well eat something while everyone else is eating. At 8:17, a full 22 minutes after everyone else's meal is delivered, my dinner shows up. 2 in my party have finished eating, and 1 ate so slow waiting for my food to come out that their food is cold (the other meal was a salad, so I guess it was already not hot.) By that time, I have been hitting the water and ate half the bowl of soup so I could only eat a little bit of the chicken.  We get all our leftovers boxed up and when the bill comes, I tell the waitress that I do not want to pay for the chicken parm that held up the family dinner. The manager comes over and asks if we were offered soup, which I was, and I told him I ate about half of it, but I ordered chicken parm and it was over 20 minutes later than the rest of the food at the table. I also told him that I did not want to punish the waitress for whatever error was made in the kitchen or with the orders. He told me I had to do what I had to do. I was like, are you serious, you are not going to take the $14.50 off the bill of over $90? He indicated that if I would leave the chicken parm leftovers at the table, he would not charge me for it.  I was shocked - I'd never heard that from a manager before in all my years of frequenting restaurants all over the country. I said to him, what difference does that make, you are just going to throw it out, and you've already created a NOT enjoyable dining experience for us here tonight. He said that if I was going to take the leftovers with me, that he was not going to give me free food. At that point, dinner ruined, I felt kinda bad leaving a $0 tip on a $93 bill, but I felt like that manager gave me no choice. Sorry Salma! Everyone understands that sometimes orders get screwed up, it's part of the experience you go through when you visit any restaurant. But the way it was handled at the Cheesecake Factory, for the price of the ""Experience"" of eating there, was definitely a bad experience. I drove by literally dozens of restaurants to get there, and I will not ever be going back. There are too many places that show they DO care about customers to give any more of my $ to a place like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh
Janie M.,"Cary, NC",19,257,22,4.0,12/15/2017,"This is a tough review for me to write because I really didn't like my dinner.  Everyone else love theirs though and the cheesecake was awesome so I'm thinking maybe Fettuccine Alfredo just isn't their thing.  They managed to somehow make it watery?  I don't know how you do that since it's butter, cream, cheese, and whatever spices you opt to throw in.  This was watery, like maybe it was made with nonfat milk instead of cream.  But it doesn't seem fair to give them lower than a 4-star review when everything else was raved about, including my salted caramel cheesecake.  So I give them four stars with the caveat, don't order the Fettuccine Alfredo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh
Vinny G.,"Apex, NC",2,6,,2.0,9/17/2017,"First off, we have been to this place countless times with no problems and if we do it is normally quickly resolved and we always end up leaving satisfied.  As of 9/17/17, on our occasional trip to the Cheesecake Factory, we ordered the tex mex egg rolls as our appetizer as well as hibachi steak and bang bang chicken and shrimp as our entrees. After about 35 or so minutes, our entrees emerged and me and my wife both were confused. We asked the waiter, who was incredibly understanding and helpful, what happened to our appetizer and he said they didn't ever make them and he would just remove them from our bill.  As I go to eat my hibachi steak, I notice there are chunks of solid potatoes mixed in with the mashed potatoes. Also, the steak, which I ordered medium, came out rare or fresh off the cow.  My wife went to go eat her meal and realized her rice was cold, not even luke warm, and the rice was all clumped together and just disintegrating upon touch.  We asked for a manager to help resolve the situation and make her aware of what went on. When the manager comes over the lady tells me that the potatoes, despite saying mashed on the menu description, are supposed to be ""LUMPY AND BUMPY"" and that the steak I got cooks more rare so I should have asked for it medium well if I wanted it medium. The lady doesn't even address the fact that my wife's meal was cold and our appetizer never came out.  In my time of dining out, I've never had somebody sit there and tell me that I'm wrong and defend the kitchen when the meal that came out was clearly not done correctly. She could have made the situation be done and over with by just saying okay and offering to re cook the dinner but instead wanted to bicker with my wife and I about our meals instead.  The customer service from management was absolutely terrible. The customer service from our waiter, Tyler, was beyond exceptional. He continued to take care of us despite the situation and maintained a positive and helpful attitude throughout. On the bright side, once the food was re cooked, the appetizer came out steaming hot and fresh in 5 minutes and our entrees were both fresh and better than the first time. Although my ""mashed"" potatoes were still ""lumpy and bumpy"". TLDR; didn't get an appetizer, food came out raw with lumpy and bumpy mashed potatoes and wife's food came out cold and nasty rice. Customer service from the manager was terrible but the waiter, Tyler, was exceptional and the second batch of food came out nice and fresh and cooked perfectly, besides the potatoes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh

The burger itself was a bit bland.. it could've been more flavorful and bigger for the price.. I felt the portions are less for the price.. good place to eat if you are around shopping in Crabtree.. but I've had better burgers elsewhere!

Sara G.,"Durham, NC",87,135,54,5.0,5/23/2017,My friend and I really enjoyed our experience. Our waiter was very attentive and joked with us when we couldn't get over the calorie count they now put in both their entree and dessert menus (ignorance is bliss when it comes to cheesecake...). I enjoyed a GIGANTIC Mexican tortilla salad. I can usually conquer any restaurant salad but Cheesecake Factory salads are a different story. It was flavorful and definitely filling. I do think their entrees are fairly pricey considering they are an American food chain (i.e. $16 for a salad with some chicken in it...) but the serving size helps me to get over it. I would recommend coming here during the week to avoid long wait times because I've been here on a Saturday and it is the place to be.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh

Amazing atmosphere, e.g. very ornate painted ceilings. Cheesecake variety is over-the-top fantastic!

My go to cheesecake flavor is Turtle, but I also love the Salted Caramel, Dove, and Red Velvet flavors.  Honestly, I've never tried a bad cheesecake from here.  Huge slices that you can really treat yourself with or be a little more modest and split with a friend. If you're coming in for dining, you really can't go wrong with any menu items.  The menu is literally a spiral bound book, and has everything from pasta to sandwiches to salads and more.  I like the Cuban sandwich, but (again) have never tried anything that wasn't super tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-raleigh

My friend & I split a lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was absolutely perfect even when we ate it back home 2 hours later!

Leonel F.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,15,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Here we are on the day of my 23rd birthday and we made the mistake of coming to this establishment. Don't come here if you expect great service and food. If you aren't hungry, don't care for human interaction, and love getting dirty looks then by all means come here. We arrived and asked for a booth instead of the area where we were being seated. The woman told us it would be a 10-15 minute wait BUT she seated a group of Caucasian women at a booth just 2 minutes after we were told to wait. We were 4 people and they were 4. So we waited at the bar and ordered appetizers. It took about another 20 before we received them and by that point we were wondering who our server was. We finally asked the gentleman who helped us earlier at the bar if he was our server and he said yeah but never told us until we asked. We ordered pineapple mojitos which were really good but that's about it. I asked for a sprite and didn't receive it until the food came out which was about 3 minutes later. We then ordered our food and when we FINALLY got it. we were shocked to see how small it was. The portions here were RIDICULOUS compared to Virginia. We ordered steak medallions and the entire plate of food was a cup. A CUP OF FOOD AND THE MUSHROOMS HAD A TERRIBLE SMELL AND TASTE AND THEY WERE BURNT!!! Our server Mike only came around about 4 3 times and left so quick that we weren't able to tell him anything we needed. We also had let him know it was my birthday and expected to be treated like the table of women across from us who was given a proper happy birthday from Cheesecake; unfortunately once we paid the bill Mike came back with a poor excuse of a happy birthday song which he SAID himself and it was melted whipped cream. He claimed to be backed up but the place was empty. The service was terrible and ruined my birthday. I don't think I can trust this establishment ever again. Either JT or Sam (the African American manager) came by when we complained and they did absolutely nothing. Not even a sorry. I suggest you choose wisely in case you want to eat somewhere.
