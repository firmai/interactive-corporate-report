266,Priscilla C.,"Los Angeles, CA",163,38,7.0,3.0,2012-02-07,"I came here last Saturday for my friend's 21st birthday dinner. The place was pretty empty, and in our group is was about 7 of us, so I'm confused as to why it took the servers about 10 minutes to come and greet us and give us the menus. Anyways, I guess there were so many servers on the floor that they didn't know who should come to us.  The girl who ended up being our server was really nice and got our orders a-okay. I was kind of skeptical because she didn't even write down what the entire table of seven needed and memorized it all. I was waiting for her to screw up, but nope, she was on key. I ordered a bacon burger and a mai tai, but honestly didn't enjoy the mai tai that much. It didn't taste sweet at all as I've had at other places, so it was just okay. Not that bad. Would I come here again? Sure, if I needed to grab some drinks somewhere close with a friend. Otherwise, I'd probably go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=280,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.9320000000000002,2.24

250,Rhina-rene' P.,"West Covina, CA",1,1,,1.0,2012-03-11,"On 2/18/12 my husband and kids decided to eat at Chili's after we filed our taxes. We live in West Covina and often eat there. I must say I was very wrong thinking that all Chilis's followed the same mission and values........Boy was I WRONG!!!! 1. Waited about 30 minutes to get seated after I was told 10-15 minutes wait then I looked and there were about eight 8 tables. 2. Our waiter was Cesar was AWESOME very courteous and attentive. 3. Order a regular Margarita had to send back thick like slurpe, and very strong not from alcohol but from the syrup. The waiter came back and apologized and said that was a very bad Margarita would you like something else said No thanks, I'll pass. He said he tasted and informed the Manager, and the Bartender.  4. I ordered the Old Timer Burger and asked for mustard asked a waiter that was passing by. When he handled me the bottle and did not realize that it was full of dust (like the dust that builds up on ceiling fans blades) the bottle was dirty like they had not clean it in months, after the dust fell unto my burger I immediately lost my appetite . I asked the waiter to please see the bottle, which he immediately removed and again apologized. I then asked to speak to a manager which took a while to get someone to come to the table. It was a female manager informed about the problem, but did not see and she apologized. As I was talking to the my waiter Dave Mills General Manager came to the table. First time I have ever encounter a GM who the first out of his mouth are "" What seems to be the problem""? No ""i'm sorry to hear there's a problem can you please tell me what happen?' But instead indicated ""So you got a bad bottle""?  I told him that was not acceptable and he responded ""Seems like your trashing the Chili's. I was in shock of how this GM was handling the situation and talking to the waiter after the waiter told him about the Margarita. He seemed to have gotten upset that he had tried it to determine the problem.    It was so bad that the table next to us was so applauded of what they were hearing from this GM, that she gave me her number.  Bottom line bad service from GM which made this dining experience a nightmare! He has no business being a GM or needs to seriously be retrained!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=260,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.8600000000000003,2.16

When we asked to get seated (there was 5 of us), we noticed there were 3 tables clean and available for us and the host told us it would be about 15 to 20 minutes!!! WTF really? Now about Charles and Richard (why we needed 2 waiters I dont know why)....Once we got to our tables it took close to 10 minutes to even see the waiters, plus we needed a highchair for my daughter and that took forever! Then we ordered drinks and that took another 10 minutes!  Please believe that it wasnt crazy packed or anything tonight, but here and it has takes 5 to 10 minutes or more to get anything AND you have ask them at least 2-3 times (or another waiter) before you get what you need.  I'm not about firing someone for doing their job, but if retraining is needed, it best be now or they will lose their jobs!   Now lets get to the food...  We ordered chips and salsa, and my goodness.. some of the chips were either too stale, too oily, too salty, or all of the above.  I ordered the chicken fajita meal and low and behold I get more SALT.  My girl ordered the fajita trio and she got the same salty grilled onions.  YUCK!  The grilled onions/peppers were way too salty, but I would have to say everything else was ok, but man chef...easy of the salt! Then we get my daughter the kids chicken tenders meal.  The batter on it looked like its was burned (dark brown) and looked no where pleasing to the eye for a kid to eat, and she was  reluctant to eat it.   The next time I go to a restaurant chain like this again, I will make sure to read Yelp first!

291,Cee N.,"Gardena, CA",2,5,,1.0,2012-04-21,"The absolute worst service ever!!! I placed an on-line order at 10:30am and their website says pick up time was 11:17am.  I arrived at 11:20am and was asked to pay and wait.  I didn't get my food until 12:10pm! I placed my order at 10:30am trying to beat the lunch rush, these F-IDIOTS made my order part of the rush! As I was waiting along with others who came in after me, the manager tried saying they were backed up because all the orders came in at once; I told her NO, that my order was placed on-line at 10:30am and she tried making another excuse because she knew I caught her in a lie. They never even gave me a chance to walk out because they collected my money as soon as I walked in and never said how long it was going to be; they just kept saying 10 more minutes every time I asked how much longer it would take. When my order of 6 entrees finally came out (regular menu items, nothing special), there were 2 orders missing!  As I checked through each order, I asked where the last 2 were and they acted like I offended them by asking where the rest of my order was.  They brought out the 5th order and acted like that was the last of it.  I asked them where 6 was and they go to the back and bring it out.  All the portions were smaller than usual.  They even forgot my chips and guacamole, which only had a few kernels of corn and 2 small slices of avocado. This is the 3rd time I've order lunch from this place on-line and every time was slow, this being the slowest.  When someone pays $100 for lunch, this is NOT the type of service or lack of quality one should expect. NEVER going back to this Chili's again.  The only reason I came back today was because it's the closest one to my work.

The food was pretty darn good -- healthy and fresh. We ordered salads, sandwiches and tacos. Everyone liked their food. Service was AWESOME. I don't know who our waitress was but every time our drinks got half full, we'd get a brand new glass with a new drink so we'd have 1.5 drinks in front of us constantly. I know it's Chili's and we're not supposed to like big national chains but the food and selection on the menu were really good.

My disappointment in my experience there today is directed at management.  I happened to leave my cell phone on the dining table we ate at.  That is totally my fault, and I take full responsibility for that.  However, my cell phone disappeared after an extremely short time (i.e. walked to my car, realized I didn't have my phone, walked back in).  The table had just been bussed, but no one had seen the phone.  Hmmm.  The manager took my name and number but didn't seem to go to any extra effort to assist in spite of the short time that had elapsed. I also spoke to the women seated near us that were still there, and they said the only people that had been by the table were the servers.   Well, I'll check ebay tonight to see if my phone is there.  In the meantime, I don't recommend this restaurant, or just make sure you don't leave any personal items there for five minutes or more.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=240,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.284,2.56

The contributing factor for this low review is based on the customer service which is really crappy. My server took 15min to just bring freaking drinks! After that I ordered and it took another 20min to get the appetizer which was salsa and chips. Seriously just plain and simple: salsa and chips!  Then guess what...? The main dish took another 25min  to be served. So you get the idea, by the time I received my main dish I was already full from the soda and chips. To make things even worse my ghetto server just left or finished her shift without saying a word so I waited an waited till I was unfortunate to get another even crappier server.

221,Kevin P.,"Long Beach, CA",23,45,97.0,2.0,2012-09-20,"Upon entering the Carson, CA location, I saw many empty tables and thought ""great, we will be seated right away"" yet was told it would be a 5-10 minute wait. I asked why since there were tables available and was told they needed to be bussed. The hostess stated they only had three servers for the entire restaurant. Having restaurant management experience myself, I knew this was a good indicator that the restaurant is mismanaged and the hostess agreed.   Once seated, Charles noticed we hadn't been waited on and was quick to respond. He quickly apologized for the wait and asked to take our order. We ordered everything at once for fear we would have to wait extra long between our drink order, appetizer and entrees but Charles proved us wrong and delivered our drinks and food quickly (perhaps because he saw I was drafting this review?).   Our appetizer (Tostada Chips & Fire-Grilled Corn Guacamole) came with greasy and overcooked chips. Our dinners (Margarita Grilled Chicken) were only warm and we thought about sending them back to be microwaved but again, we feared it would take too long so we ate them anyway.   The food was good and it was clear Charles and the rest of the crew were making a good effort to take care of as many customers as they could while serving the food in a timely manner. Since I witnessed the wait staff and food runners diligently working to provide the best service possible, I can only surmise the problem lies with the poor management running this particular location.   The hostess could have been better trained to open the door for arriving customers as many of Chili's competitors do, take the customer's drink order if the wait staff is busy and maybe even assist with bussing the tables. None of the workers had smiles on their faces and they all seemed to be very stressed. At no point in the evening did I see any signs of a manager.

Food was okay.  Pretty much it's chilli's, so no matter what Chili's your at, food should be the least of your worries. The service by far is what kills this place.  Walked in on a Sunday at around 9pm, still with two hour of business time left.  They quoted us for a 30 minute wait but seemed like it was only ten.   Was seated and the waitress that seated us, left the menu and drink menu.  3 minutes pass and then another waitress came and asked us if we were ready to order. Of course we weren't.  We explained that two more people were coming and was told that their order had to be placed by ten. We seemed to be a bit rushed so picked out a few items.   Took around 20 minutes until out waitress came to take our order.  Took 20 minutes until our food came.   So by now we have 15 minutes until the kitchen closes and we are just getting our food.  So much for desert. 5 minutes pass and boom!!  There is our check!  Understanding that there is an hour until closing time.  We got our money and paid while most of us still had about half of our food left.  We figured we would be left alone to enjoy our food and get the drink refills as need but this was expecting too much. 10 on the dot happens and this place become a mad house for closing time.  Keep in mind it is only 10pm maybe a few minutes after.  I am currently still eating at this time.  We asked a different waitress for bags and boxes for our food.  Comes back with bags and boxes, but negates to pick up our empty plates.

We arrived around 8PM, and were seated pretty immediately.  Our waitress was very pleasant, but super slow and difficult to find throughout our meal.  We ordered off the 2 for $20 menu (which includes one of the pre-selected appetizers and two entrees) and got: Tostada Chips & Corn Roasted Guacamole Chicken Fajitas Cajun Chicken Pasta The chips and guacamole came out relatively quickly.  The chips were incredibly thin, which caused them to break really easily when trying to scoop the guacamole.  The appetizer came with some salsa when mixed with the guacamole actually tasted pretty yummy.  There wasn't anything special about the guacamole, it was okay. The Cajun Chicken Pasta was not as cajun-y as I thought it was going to be.  I expected some spice and kick to the pasta, but instead it simply tasted like an alfredo sauce.  There was a piece of garlic bread on top of the pasta that was greasy and not-so-flavorful as half of the bread was burnt.  My friend seemed to enjoy her fajitas.

270,Henry Y.,"Carson, CA",99,141,60.0,1.0,2013-01-24,"OOOOOKKKKKKKK HERE WE GOOOOOO SOOOO. Let me start with something positive....................... ""I love the name Chili's"" (there now this review is officially fair. lol I walked into chili's one day for take out and they took almost 10 minutes for someone to come out and take my order. It was lunch time on a weekday, the place wasn't packed, and about 3 employee's walked right by me and didn't say anything. IF  IT'S NOT YOUR WORK STATION TELL WHOEVER'S WORK STATION IT IS, AND TELL THE GUEST THEY WILL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.  After my order was taken I sat and watched an older gentlemen struggle to find someone to help him find someone to take his order. It made me so sad to see, but eventually he found someone. Also while I was sitting there waiting on my order, the phones were going off that no one was answering. It was the phone to take orders right next to the register at the to go counter. 01/17/13 The second time I went was about 9pm-10pm on a Thursday night. The infamous ""If you would like to make a togo order please see the bartender"" sign was up. I went to the bartender who looked to be busy and asked for help, she said one minute please I said ok. I was watching the Laker game that was on the screen for about 5 minutes and she came back to me. When she came back to me it was with the worst ""hurry up and order""  attitude I've ever seen in the history of food service in my life. She was soooooo rude and I haven't even said 3 words to her yet. She said ""so what did you want"" with this hurry up and order face continuously nodding to get me to finish, just completely rushing me. (keep in mind, I already new what I wanted, I get the same thing every time. Baby back ribs full rack with original bbq sauce, side of loaded mash, and apples ""easy right?"" so why was she rushing me???? That order doesn't even take 20 sec to say.) She comes back and ask if that's it once again giving me attitude. YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT I HIT  HER CAR ON THE WAY IN AND NOW SHE HAD TO SERVE ME OR SOMETHING. Before she finished putting the order in I realized I wanted a black berry lemonade. I'm a bit irritated at this point by her attitude but I'm thinking to myself she's over worked maybe (making excuses for her in my head). I politely said excuse me and she didn't hear me (maybe) so I asked the gentleman facing her to get her attention for me. As she turns around I said actually ma'am I would like a black berry lemonade. She then rolls her eye's takes a deep breath and exhales pretty loud. I generally don't walk out but TODAY WAS THAT DAY!!!!!! My company brings employee's here all the time for a sit down and eat company business meeting. All and all the customer service in this place has a feel of "" we don't need your money"". From the not answering the phones, to the long wait times to order the to go orders, to the employee's. Most companies have a Good, Better, and Best structure. Carl's Jr for example Best: $6 Burger meal large size. Better: Regular meal large size. Good: individual items (i.e. a single burger, 99 cent chicken sandwich) pretty much something for EVERYONE saying : we don't care if your rich, or a bum on the street,  WE WANT WHATEVER MONEY YOU HAVE, PENNY'S NICKLES DIMES WHATEVER!!!! JUST SPEND IT HERE!!! They lose money daily, DAILY!!! for stupid reasons for the reasons listed above (not answering phones, long wait times to order, and customer service). This chili's has lost my business, I will no longer refer or bring my employee's here. It's sad that a city such as Carson so close to Compton (90746 area) easily adopts a negative connotation, and when a person has to decide whether to go to the chili""s in Torrance or the one in Carson they will make the further drive to go to one that reflects a more upscale community for better customer service. I hope the employee's read this and now understand the low amount of hours they are possibly getting. Henry Ford (the founder of the Ford Motor Company, and sponsor of the development of the assembly line technique of mass production) eliminated a note worthy amount of people in the work force, replacing them with machines. In an economy where it's already rough to find a job, we still see this today. AMC theaters automated ticket buying service which eliminates the people at the window, vending machines in general. I guess to get the desired service I'll just have to go to Chili's online to order, walk in pay and leave don't need a full staff to ring me up after all. After all it would be nice to see that bartender replaced with an App on my cell phone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=280,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.4760000000000002,2.2

368,Joel C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2013-03-31,Last night my family and I had the worst experience at Chili's ever. First of we were given a 30/35 minute wait time. We waited patiently for a bit over an hour before we got seated. As we got seated they already knew we where upset of the wait time and said the manager was aware and was going to try to fix things. Manager never showed up and waitress was taking forever to take our order after she had already given us our drinks which she also got wrong. After that we told the hostess we were leaving and were very disappointed at service and walked out. They showed no concern to try to fix the problem and due to that Chili's has lost a customer. It was my families first time trying Chili's and the only thing they got to try was a zip of their drink (for those that got the right drink) and bad customer service. They will never try to eat at Chili's again. We went to wing stop after that and got better service there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=360,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.4760000000000002,1.96
222,Ricardo M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",7,55,,1.0,2013-04-11,"First time I have been to this Chili's location...not impressed.  Generally, I don't like Chili's but my girlfriend loves their burgers.  So since relationships are all about compromise, off to Chili's we went. Seating - First off, we were quoted a wait time of 15 to 20 minutes.  The place was pretty packed so that was fine.  Luckily, or maybe not so luckily, a table opened in the bar area so we took that instead of waiting. Patrons - Please note that since Carson is Compton adjacent, you will have a much rowdier crowd that is borderline or has crossed the line into ratchet territory.  It appears that the staff meets the same criteria as the people who frequent this Chili's location. So expect a lot of hooting and hollering during your dining experience. Staff - When taking the aforementioned table in the bar area, I asked the waitress working the area if the table was open.  Sensed a bit of an attitude but whatever, I kind of expected it. She then proceeds to clean the table with a towel by wiping all the crumbs and leftover remnants onto the floor and seats.  Nice to know they keep the place in such tip top shape! Food -  Ordered the 2 for $20 deal.  Appetizers were cheese sticks which came out cold.  It was like eating a stick of string cheese coated in batter.  Usually cheese sticks come out a little gooey when they are done being fried.   Ordered the bacon cheese burger as the entrée.  Took a few bites and noticed that the burger was on a wheat bun.  It didn't bother me much but my girlfriend was kinda irked about it.  We asked the waitress what was up and she went to the back. Apparently, they had been out of regular hamburger buns for a few days...seems to me that this place is a little mismanaged.  The least our server could have done was notify us...but she said she hadn't noticed a difference when serving the food for the last few days? Overall, I don't expect much from Chili's or any other chain restaurant but the staff and atmosphere at this location pretty much takes the cake as worst Chili's around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=240,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.5720000000000003,1.96

We ordered two margaritas and three appetizers. The only positive thing I have to say about this Chili's is the drinks. The Bartender was really trying hard: he was the only one at the entire bar with about 20 some people waiting on him. Unfortunately the rest of it was a disaster. The worst thing about this Chili's is the hygiene. I have no idea how they pass food inspection. While we were sitting at the bar, we noticed that the bartender would grab a used glass, dunk it into a soapy sink, then into the next one with less soap, and finally into one with little soap. He then poured water into that glass and served - with bubbles still on it. Both of us were in disbelief because there's no way that the guy didn't even wipe the glass. But it happened over and over again. What drew the line for us, was when we saw the server drop some fries on the counter next to the dishwash zone, and proceded to put it back onto the plate. It was clearly obvious that some dishwashing soap had gotten on there and both of us stopped eating. Please save yourself some stomach (and heart) ache by avoiding this place at all cost.

367,P R.,"Torrance, CA",0,30,,2.0,2013-05-25,"This is the worst Chili's location! I've been here a few times since it is right down the street from my boyfriend's house and sometimes it is easier than to drive to Del Amo. My very first experience there was a year or two ago with a friend. At the end when we paid the waiter asked, ""did you want change back?"" Yeah, I want my change! You don't know if you're getting a tip! And he didn't. I'm a firm believer in tipping well because let's face it, customer service jobs suck, and those people deserve good tips for dealing with people all day, but don't ASSUME you deserve the tip! It was really unprofessional. Anyway, this is the problem with this Chili's: most of their staff sucks! Last week I went with my mom and siblings and we were told the wait was fifteen minutes. It was about twenty five minutes into waiting when the waitress let us know the bar was also open for seating. It would've been nice if she would've told us that twenty-five minutes ago. Of course, I should've assumed so as well since at other Chili's it is always open seating, so no big deal. She had some kind of throat illness, couldn't even say the names loud enough for customers to hear, and so she had to repeatedly say the name of the next party in a scratchy voice. It really made me nervous because she seemed very sick, they should've sent her home or got someone else to host because she's in contact with the menus and so many people. Our waiter took about ten minutes to notice us, but when he did he actually turned out to be one of the best waiters I've had! He memorized our order, repeated it back to us perfectly, had our food out shortly, and gave us extra ranch and dressings without needing to ask. His partner, on the other hand, did not bring me the check when I asked for it. We had to ask our main waiter again! This Chili's is also always packed.

We went in on a Tuesday around 4pm and sat at the bar. There was only another couple at the bar who had ordered take out and another couple sitting in a booth, when my girlfriend and I walked in along with a separate couple. They chose a booth and we went to the bar top. First of all, wash your hands before you eat after you touch a menu there! Disgusting!! Second, check all of your silverware! Of my two forks that were lying atop each other, one was pasted with something brown and came out of a napkin that was rolled by an employee! After ten minutes of waiting, Stephanie finally came out from somewhere and threw a coaster in front if us and barely offered us a drink. I know that chilis offers happy hour but there was no menu, and after we ordered a full price appetizer, I asked her if they had happy hour and she rolled her eyes at me and went searching for one, which was also filthy dirty! She walked off and for the next 15 minutes while we waited for our appetizer trio(that was served cold), I took the liberty of watching what was going on. My girlfriend is server at a fine dining restaurant and my expectation of chilis is never going to be high but there is a standard! Where we were sitting was right near the entrance of the kitchen and not one female there wears their hair back in at least a pony tail, and I know for a fact that they all serve and handle food because I've worked in a newer chain as well. Team service is supposed to help things along but there is no management at this chilis to ensure that's happening. In the 15 minutes we waited, the couple that was there when we arrived was mad at the slow service and wanted to cancel their order, and another couple that had walked in was asking if they could get some service. The manager was finally dealing with the people who were canceling but disappeared and wasn't seen again. All the while Stephanie spent the entire time running her hands through her unkempt hair and talked to another couple that came to the bar after us. She never asked us if our food was ok, which it wasn't and it was clear she didn't want us to order more. Too bad because I'm a great tipper and if she hadn't let me leave hungry she probably would have gotten the best tip she'd ever gotten! This chilis is the worst!

I should have know better when I saw that it has an AVERAGE of 2 stars. The bathroom was a mess (broken soap dispensers, towels on the floor, baby changing station looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days). Our server came to the table and had a dirty uniform (this was around 1pm, 3 hours after they opened). She forgot my girlfriend's coffee and brought it after we reminded her and already finished our food. She wasn't very welcoming or attentive. The ""fresh corn guacamole"" (that's supposed to be made ""fresh"" everyday) was brown. The manager didn't even know it was suppose to be made fresh everyday and tossed after 12 hours. We were given plates that were dirty and had huge chunks that were broken off. My girlfriend's sandwich was not made right and looked terrible. Her son's chicken breast looked like it had been sitting for 30 minutes before it was brought out. My food was decent. The manager didn't even know the name of my girlfriend's sandwich when she comped it. When she came to the table to apologize, she also was dirty and didn't look professional. Her and our server were nice. There's no excuse for how dirty that restaurant was. I am a manager at a restaurant, and can tell you that the reason this place has 2 stars is poor management. The food quality is poor, cleanliness and sanitation are poor, the service at best was below average. I can't even imagine what the kitchen or back of house look like, when they were ok with how the front of house looked.

I don't know what their management is doing but the waiters and customer service is just lousy!  We celebrated my boyfriend's niece's birthday here this past Wednesday. Please tell me why we had to wait around more than half the time for our waitress? She didn't bring us our drinks for 20 mins and 35 mins after we ordered we asked her where are our appetizers and she responds I kid you not ""Don't chu know the food needs to cook baby?"" Umm, are you kidding me lady? Never once did she ask us how we were doing as we were waiting. Finally after we got our food which was almost an hour later, we didn't see her until we had to remind her about the birthday song for our niece. It's like our waitress DGAF. She strolled around extra slow and had no sense of urgency. Maybe it's cause we had a party of 11 but there were 4 kids and she was already getting a tip.

Chili's was so warm and inviting I had a blast eating here with my friends and family I'm back in Carson my hometown celebrating life and I'm loving it.    My friend is very ill and this is where she wanted to eat she invited me and I was happy to be here for her.  Our party of 15 was amped and ready for a good time.   These are a few of the things we ordered.  Triple orders of guacamole salsa and chips the guacamole was buttery and full of flavor the salsa was standard and tasty, the chips were light and crunchy and held up well under that thick luscious guacamole it was soo good I couldn't stop eating it.  We enjoyed platters of hot wings, egg rolls and mozzarella sticks that the tray was  devoured and they ordered more.    We enjoyed crispy fried onion rings with an assortment  of dipping sauces the onion rings were a bit greasy but tasted great.  I ordered a triple cheese pizza and added mushrooms it was crispy cheesy and delicious.  I had a refreshing watermelon lemonade and the refills were free.  My sister had a blueberry infused pineapple margarita she said it was delicious and strong.  Several friends ordered patron martinis with these cute mini patron refill bottles and the neatest little frosted glass everyone who ordered them loved the tasty cocktail.  My sweet friend enjoyed a few bites of grilled chicken and shrimp skewers chips and salsa she was very tired and never once did she complain. My sister's entree was steak seafood and salad her meal was wrapped to go after a few bites, she says it was perfect and that her son will enjoy the rest. Lol I ordered a slice of cheesecake to go it had two sides of strawberry sauce the cheesecake tasted alright it was a bit too dense and wasn't very flavorful.  I poured on the strawberry sauce and Kapow the flavor was kicked up a notch that strawberry sauce was fantastic.   Our party ordered way too much food and I didn't dare ask to photograph anyone's plate of food for fear of getting my fingers bitten these girls don't play. Lol Everyone loved the food and our poor waitress was kept on her toes with our huge party she brought out the food in a timely manner and was constantly refreshening our drinks.   We left her a huge tip and she deserved it. We have no complaints whatsoever our friend got out of the house and enjoyed herself in a restaurant that allowed us to talk and enjoy our food without being rushed we all had a fantastic time.  I'm giving them 5 stars and this restaurant deserves it, we were treated very well and the service was flawless.  I will definitely come back for that delicious tortilla soup.

You can never go wrong with that; its cheesy, hot, creamy, has chicken, and it has texture because it has crispy tortilla strips For my main course i tried the 6oz classic sirloin with grilled avocados. Its on the lighter choices, i ordered my steak medium rare. It was great! I loved the cherry tomatos mixed and roasted with garlic, and the salad fresca wasnt too shabby. I wished they didnt have the salad pre tossed, but its ok because it was light. The avocados were not roasted, BUT thats ok because i love my avocados prepared any way! To top it off, i had to try their southern style mac n cheese. It was a side and the portion and price was great 1.00$ and it was ultra cheesy!! Definitely love this place!

They decided on Chili's and this was the closest one. Because no one wants to be on a date with their mom, the kids ate in the dining area and I sat at the bar. Marche was very friendly and attentive even though she was ALL ALONE! This was about 9:30pm on a Saturday night. She moved around the bar with ease making sure to speak with each customer. A waitress came to her as some guests in the dining area were getting antsy waiting for their drinks. I then realized she wasn't making drinks for only the bar area (including food orders for those of us sitting at the bar) but she was making drinks for the entire restaurant.  Through it all she kept a smile on her face and even managed to make some small talk with me about my son, as she made 3 drinks at once.  This Chili's is typically very slow and seems unorganized most times.

We put in an order for traditional bone in buffalo wings, the server even clarified that we wanted bone in wings. 20 minuts later, no wings....the server stopped by and realized they hadn't arrive and promised they would be out shortly (thinking she forgot to put in the order). Shortly turned into another 15 minutes and then they brought us the wrong wings, breaded and nugget like. So they sent those back and eventually we ended up with an order of wings. They were average, and served with below average blue cheese dressing. We tried to order drinks, each asking for a shot plus an actual beverage. Nothing arrived. Finally the server came over and said she could not serve us more than one drink at a time...ok that is understandable, but why haven't we gotten one of our drinks yet? Finally the shots arrive, well poured so thank you for that....and eventually our beverages arrived.  Server went home, so the new lady helping us seemed quite nice and more on top of things. We both ordered rib eyes medium rare with extra broccoli and garlic butter...food arrived and while they got the order right, the steaks were awful. One rib eye was mooing at us (perfect thanks) the other was gray and cooked all the way through (uh this is not medium rare). I hate sending food back so I tried to power through my gray steak. It was awful, super tough and my jaw ached from trying to chew it. I ended up tapping out, was offered a box to take it home and declined....I wanted to get as far away from that shoe leather as possible.

I normally will find something good about the place to replace the bad experience. Since it was my Mother's bday,I had asked our server,Maria to see if she can do a little something after our dinner and she was all for it saying they will come and do the whole shabang with an ice cream. Awesome! So,here we go! We ordered 2 orders of their 2 for $20 deals which you get an appetizer and your choice of 2 entrees and we also ordered beers and side salads. We didn't even get the appetizers for awhile. I,for one was starvin' like Marvin' and was already getting a mean headache from just waiting. Finally,the side salads came and yet no appetizers. The server didn't anticipate that we would need small plates and utensils. Don't you think you would have done that before the appetizers came out? (Smh) And bam, 1 appetizer down and one more to go. The order of everything wasn't coming out right. After the appetizer, then we get one of the entree's then another then an appetizer? Hello! They are appetizers for a reason yet the 2nd one was delivered with our main entrees. Whatever! I was hungry!   Service sucks and our server had no personality whatsoever as if she didn't even want to be there. She was MIA most of the time that another server had to come and check on us. Food is mediocre and I devoured my baby back ribs like a cave man. So,we were all done with our dinner and we waited for her to check on us. She asked if we wanted desserts and we said no. I just wanted for her to come out with what we've talked about. Minutes passed and nothing! I waited for her again yet she was already too busy with another table and seemed like she was in a totally different world. All she did was ask if we were familiar with the kiosk computer on our table so we can pay the bill. Wow! This was one shitty dinner for my Mother's bday.

192,James T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1.0,1.0,2016-03-12,I am very disappointed at your service here tonight. I wish that the waiters and waitresses will be able to take their feelings out of the point I have put in the perspective of what they need to do. This is your job so get over your feelings. We did not order your feelings so do not give it to us. I do hope that one day you guys were realize that your quality service will go so much higher if you were simply more patient and more grateful with the opportunity that is given. But I would not recommend this restaurant for any delay time goers due to the fact that the waiters get ruder by the hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=220,2.48,2.15,2.15,1.6360000000000001,2.282
71,Kelly R.,"Long Beach, CA",8,39,83.0,3.0,2016-03-29,"I often find myself in a predicament when meeting my LA/ Southbay friends for drinks. Through the years, we established that the City of Carson is the PERFECT half way point between the Torrance/ Southbay area and Downtown LBC. Its very easy to get to and also right off both the 91 and 405 freeways. However, aside from IKEA , this city offers absolutely NOTHING to civilization or humankind. Well except for Chilis of course.  REMINDER FOR YOU FANCY FOLKS: This place is a CHAIN RESTAURANT, so please don't come here expecting anything  spectacular. FYI- Like most other chain restaurants, hardly anything is actually made fresh. Most sauces, soups, etc are frozen and NOT made in house.  Ok so upon arriving here with no expectations/ appetite, i'd have to my overall experience was OK. Not LBC's George's Greek GOOD, but not Compton's TGIFriday's BAD either.  FOOD: 3/5 They have a few appetizers and drink specials for abt 3-6 bucks each- not too shabby. We got the southwestern eggrolls and the chips and guac. Guac was bland and under seasoned- typical. The southwestern egg rolls tasted weird and stale like they came out of somebodies microwave, but ill digress.  DRINKS: 3/5 I played it safe and stuck with Pino Grigio ($3.79 each)  and my friend got the sunset margarita(NOT on HH menu, abt 8 bucks) As i predicted, the margarita was all sugar- no liquor. BOOOO.  SERVICE- 4/5 Our food came quickly after ordering. Servers are friendly and attentive. Another plus is that they have mini kiosks on all of the tables at the bar, so we did not have to wait to order more food/ drinks or to get our bill.   FINAL THOUGHTS: This is literally a no -frills type of place that serves the sole purpose of meeting a friend for a brief catch up over drinks. Don't come here HANGRY- you WILL leave sad and disappointed. And stick with wine or basic cocktails/ well drinks. Until Carson steps its game up and opens more happy hour spots, my southbay friends and i will be returning here for an occasional drink or two. Or three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=40,2.56,2.16,2.16,1.836,2.3200000000000003

302,Danielle L.,"Long Beach, CA",32,34,1.0,1.0,2016-08-16,"My family and I patronized this restaurant on Sunday after church. We were lucky to find a table in the bar . We sat there for about 10mins before we stopped someone to get us drinks. Not one server came by to welcome us . So we order drinks and they come without straws. The server comes back with the straws and I find a floatie in my club soda. I ask for another. That takes another 10mins. In the meantime we decided what we were gonna order. We ask the gentleman if he was our server, because he never identified himself as such. We just thought we stopped a random server walking by, because that was how the interaction felt. He tells us he's our server. So we begin to order.  We have food allergies at our table. So I'm a little nervous because he's not writing anything down. I figured maybe he has done this before and continue ordering. I order a house salad, no onion. I look the server in the face and tell him that my husband has an onion allergy. To prevent any onion even being around him, I ordered my salad this way. I also reiterated this to the server. I ordered my main which was the Chicken Fajitas. Knowing that these are traditionally made with onion. I again ask for the onion to be omitted from my plate. Again reiterating that there is an allergy to onion at the table. Sizzling onions at the table would bother him. He says ok.  So the salads come out perfect,mine with no onion. At this time our drinks are beginning to empty. I start to look around and see our server sitting in a chair in the ""to go"" area. He's taking a break in the middle of our service while we all sit there thirsty. He finally decides to come by the table. We ask for refills, which didn't hit the table until after I asked the manager Patrick for one when our experience went sour. We will get there eventually.  So the food starts to come out. Here comes mine, Chicken fajitas with onion everywhere. Steaming onion aroma fills the air as they sizzle on the grill. I immediately look and say this is not supposed to have onion. Our server doesn't respond and just takes the plate away nonchalantly. I begin to get upset because I specifically asked this guy not to put onion on my plate. I even explained why I needed it not to be on there. I look over at my husband as his eyes get red and he start hacking. He starts to cough really aggressively. I ask if he's ok. I keeps coughing for about 4mins. I then look and he's turning red. I force him to go outside and get some fresh air. By this time the server comes back over and brings my friends food. Once again he nonchalantly shrugs off my husbands allergy. Who is now outside sitting on a bench catching his breath. My friend asks the server if he is remorseful, because he wasn't even apologetic. That's when we asked for a manager. Mind you only half of our table has food. Patrick, the manager, comes over and I begin to explain to him how upset I was by what happened. I explained to him that I have been in the service industry for 10yrs and I still write down orders. I work for Mortons The Steakhouse, as a server. Now I don't expect to receive the same level of service at Chili's that I give at Mortons. However, I do expect to not be served something I said I specifically didn't want. Patrick brings out our food. He also gets us refills. Which hadn't had happened until that point. He also informs me that my husbands food hadn't come out because it made incorrectly as well. Patrick told us that, we would have a new server Andre. He also told us he had taken 25% off of our bill. We finally all had our food. My friends were done, but at least we were eating. Our drinks were low again, as we were drinking with our meals. We were looking for a refill. However, it would be another 20mins before a server even acknowledged our presence. So we asked a server, some girl not Andre,for our bill. I still til this day. Have no idea who Andre is or what he looks like. So we wait, and wait. She comes back about 10mins later. She tells us there had been a computer issue and she would do her best to get our check.........Still no Andre. So we are beyond irritated at this point and my friend approaches the ""to go"" counter where Patrick is standing. She asks him for our check. He says there's a computer failure and there's nothing he can do. We tell him we just want to pay. Patrick then informs us that we can pay on Ziosk machine. That information would have been nice 20mins before. We pay our bill and Patrick can see that I'm upset. He send a lady manager over to ask about our experience. I told her the story and said I would never be back. They gave me some Chili Bucks and I still will never go to Carson Chili's again. After the food mess up, the service was still horrible. No one ever came by. The level of carelessness was disgusting. Though they attempted to make me happy it was too late. Food allergies are something serious. This location doesn't take them serious enough for me and my family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=100,2.08,2.18,2.088,2.084,2.14

Beyond that, it is a Chili's.  If you have been to one, you should have an opinion if you like the food or not.  It isn't my favorite chain, but it is easy to find something to eat on the menu I want to try.  Plus, they make my go-to home recipe for Margaritas (OK, I stole their recipe).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=20,2.16,2.12,2.08,2.604,2.136

No friendly greeting or ""we apologize for the wait""...finally seated, we literally waited for 15 minutes and no server to offer us drinks. I had to flag down someone from another section (she was very helpful)...great..until we were waited from our official server. In which he asked if we were ready to order, with his reply in a rude manner ""let's go then""...WOW REALLY...not a pleasant or comfortable experience  for the remainder of the evening. Call it ""bad timing"" if u will. However, it's unfortunate that one staff member messed the whole thing up. ***UPDATE IN REAL TIME***...our waiter messed up our order...(that's what happens when u don't write down orders)...you go to a hole in the wall spot where the food is awesome, you'd expect maybe a little ""sucky"" service.

310,Kristina R.,"San Diego, CA",107,4,,2.0,2016-12-28,Had a disappointing time at this chilis. I normally come here with my family and have a great service and a great time. Unfortunately on this day I was incredibly disappointed about the service. Walked in was immediately told wait was about ten minutes didn't get seated till thirty minutes later various tables were open. Seemed a bit weird. We we're finally seated we didn't get any kind of service till 20 min after we were seated. We order two appetizers and our meals. Our entrees arrived before our appetizers. Not to mention no kind of accommodations were made about this. They didn't even inform us that they didn't have chips till the food was already coming out. We were informed the chips would be ready and a couple of minutes so we said that was fine we understand. We waited some more no sign of the chips. She then offered to change our order so we opted to change the order because it would be faster according to her. The chicken was undercooked not even crispy almost soggy. People who were seated after us who had ordered the same appetizers were served before us. Which was odd since we had been there for forty minutes already just waiting. We did notice that they were not busy which added to our confusion on why our service was not what it has been before. The girl who served us seemed really nice and polite to other customers but did not seem that way when she would approach our table. Will not be going again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=100,2.52,2.2,2.128,1.9280000000000002,2.3280000000000003

My husband ordered a new BBQ item and did not receive fries with the order. He had to ask for the fries but by the time they arrived he was over the experience and was just ready to go.. The chicken strips did not have BBQ sauce on it like the picture and description showed. My water also had a tap water taste to it. Yuck.

We later changed it to 16. They informed us that 13 of us can sit at one table and the rest can sit at adjacent booths and once the table next to us was available, we can sit there. Totally understandable and accommodating. After providing us a table (for 12 not 13) we sat around for 20 minutes before anyone even asked if we had been helped. Also, there was only 1 adjacent booth which seated 2 people which meant a couple of us were just standing around waiting for the table next to us to clear up. That was pretty awkward.  While the server was helpful he seemed totally overwhelmed. Service was really slow and we had to wait 10-15 minutes between soda refills and tortillas (for the fajitas). I understand its Saturday night and their busy, but the manager could have gotten our server some help or taken another table of off his plate so he can focus on a large party. When the food finally did come, it was all very good. I tried the steak, fajitas, and tacos...everything was on point.

Our waitress Adriana was distracted, unable to multitask, forgetful and had a poor attitude.  She was more concerned with the next table over; where two young men was flirting with her and another server.   She was irritated that we wasn't ready but that just the beginning. She never brought the item my niece requested for her soup, napkins or refilled any beverages. Another person in our party subbed French fries for onions rings which came after he was done eating his burger. She said, ""oh I think somebody else took them; I didn't bring them?""  She brought the ranch dressing my niece asked for, when the food was already partially eaten and just rolled her eyes when we requested some to go.   My mom's soup was cold. She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything. She placed the ""to go"" bag on a plate in some sauce. It was so bad we was too fearful to request anything else from her.  While seated at the table I called to speak to a manager from my cell phone but there was no answer.  Really?!?!  Now I know why the servers are so subpar.  Finally, Vicki a manager is flagged down. Vicki is a manager who is clearly overwhelmed, unaware and has no clue about restaurant management or hospitality.  Get it together Chilis.  The finale: my family was so upset they gave me the money and started getting ready to go because we waited almost 30 minutes for her to come back to close the check. Then she appears because she thought we was going to walk out. Smh. She claimed our gift card was decline when there was plenty of money on it.  After paying for that disappointing meal. We ran outa there. Never to return again. Really?!?! Carson Chilis is terrible.  The only nice person was the young lady taking names as the host. I told her to be encouraged and don't stay here.

I will be as honest as possible as I write this review.  First the hostess, was awesome a guy and girl and they were both just pleasant and polite. My cousin and I sat in the Bar area and it was nice and not crowed or loud and had just the right amount of people in the section. We came here last Sunday for happy hour. Our waitress was really nice as well, BUT she threw me off with padding her head over and over and over again. It started making me nerves because she was handling food as well. She continuously scratched her scalp as well. So much I don't believe she realized she did it as much as she did. Again, it made me nervous. Nothing is wrong with weaves, but when it starts to inch as much as she was padding her head, a good wash is terribly needed.  As for my food, I got a veggie burger and fries and oh my....the veggie patty was phenomenal!!!  It was seasoned so well and I enjoyed it a lot. I also got a Mango Margarita and oh my again, it was yummy, strong, and delicious. If I wasn't driving I would have gotten 3-4 drinks but I only purchase the one.  Nonetheless the entire experience was good besides the padding of the head.

As it was the close of the day for them, the waitresses were sweeping and tidying up in preparation to go home. I noticed one waitress swept under tables, and swept (using the broom) a bottle of ketchup from under one table along with other trash. Instead of taking the bottle and trashing it, she puts it back onto the table for another innocent patron to use it. How unsanitary is that???? I was disgusted. I asked to speak to a manager, in which a manager named Andre came out and heard my complaint. Didn't even get to finish my story, he rudely walks away and goes and removed the bottle from the table. No apology, no rectification, no nothing... is that awesome customer service or what? I immediately wrote corporate and will never come back. This was gross and management not rectifying this or accommodating or acknowledging my complaint was the icing on the cake. Never again!! Made me question the utensils and condiments on my table. People urinate and sometimes poop on the floor in the restrooms and walk out to the communal area that she swept, and to think she used the groom to get a bottle of ketchup from under the table and conveniently puts it back on the table for people to use... yummm how appetizing is that???

If the quality of your service is inconsistent, your customers will not be pleased, as I have experienced before but NEVER with this young lady in particular!

I've also been in the Olive Garden there and wasn't surprised how similar the service would be.  To start off, the service is slow. My waiter wasn't really trying too hard to make sure I was happy and would pass by once every full moon.  The food was mediocre. My girlfriend and I ordered chips and salsa realizing that it would be awhile before we'd see our food. We were pleasantly surprised to find what looked to be bits of a chip within the salsa which grossed us out. After asking the waiter to replace it. The hilarious part was that he brought us out our food before realizing that he forgot all about the salsa. The environment and overall establishment was a dirty mess. Tables were dirty and unclean and the seats looked like they needed to be replaced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=20,2.56,2.34,2.208,2.44,2.428

Drinks came out average time.  15 minutes later she came ti take our order.  We ordered and 10 minutes later the my son's food and the appetizer came out. Then nothing else.   So my sister in law ask for a manager. HE went back to ask about the food.  Then brings out the wrong order. Then the the manager comes out.  He apologizes and says the food will be right out and offers a discount is 25 percent on the food. We talk him into 50%. The food comes and he brags about how fresh the food is and apologizes again. We proceed to eat. My sister goes to bite into her corn on the cob and in was ICE cold like it just got out of the freezer. Needless to say they comp our meal.

We were driving around before the game to find somewhere to get food and a few drinks before the game. We went into the BWW in the same shopping center and it was packed! So we kept driving and ran into this Chili's.  When we walked in, there was only a few tables open in the bar area so we grabbed a booth. Even though most of the seats were full with other football fans, our service was so fast! Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks and food came out a lot quicker than I expected for the decent size crowd in the bar area.  One person who stood out to us was the manager on duty, Patrick (we stopped him before we left to ask his name). The entire time we were sitting there, he was hustling and helping out anywhere he could. He was cleaning behind the bar, pouring beers, delivering food. I was very impressed with the leadership he showed. I work in hospitality management and that's the kind of person we'd want working in our establishment. Great job Patrick! Way to be a role model to your team, I know from experience that team members work harder when they feel supported by their supervisor.

I couldn't taste the strawberry flavor and it didn't have the kick that I had in the one I ordered weeks ago at a different location. It tasted funny. The server asked if I wanted them to remake it but then she found out that it's premade. So I went with the blueberry pineapple margarita and that was tasty but you couldn't taste the tequila. I saw 3 containers of that as well. So clearly they don't make each drink to order but prep everything before hand. The chicken and waffle sliders were good as well as the house salad.

Our server spoke to her manager who was Patrick tonight and he quickly came to our table to Thank our Marines for their services and took care of the little issue with no problem.  I was very impressed by Patrick because he was so involved with his staff and helping clearing tables with a little dancing and clapping, he was even singing.

When we received our silverware 3 sets had to be sent back due to still having food on them, along with a couple of cups. When the food came out two dishes were dropped and those members of our party had to wait which is obviously understandable. What we didn't understand was why it took another 20-30 minutes before they were able to get their food. Seeing as they were dropped when everyone else at the table was already eating, replacing those plates should have been priority over other tables. When the last plate was finally brought we were offered a free dessert however no one was interested so I asked for both meals to be comped seeing as our experience started out bad from the get go.
