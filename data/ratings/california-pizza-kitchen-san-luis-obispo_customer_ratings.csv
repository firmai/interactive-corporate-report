81,Mrs. T.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",6,178,12.0,2.0,2012-01-15,Servers are usually great but hostesses are always awful. That's what they get for hiring ditzy college girls who gossip and text rather than seating customers in a timely manner. My husband ordered the mac and cheese starter.

We also had to wait eternity just to get the bill because the server vanished and could not be found.  That was even after we asked another server to go find them.

If a pizza parlor and a bistro had a baby, you might wind up with something like this. The pizza IS very good. Most recently, I ordered a thin-crust chicken/pesto selection that was great. The salads are awesome, as well, and there's a selection of tasty soups, too. The menu also includes sandwiches, pasta and a few other items.

We waited about 10 minutes before someone came to get our drinks and we did not receive any refills the entire time until after we paid the waiter asked if we wanted refills.

Bad idea, I know.  We were seated at a tiny two person table between two large parties- that is always a little awkward.  We ordered the mushroom gourmet option with whole wheat crust. These pies are pretty pricey. It's all in the name I guess. The pizza we ordered was a medium and the pizza we got was tiny. The two of us easily finished it off and felt a little let down. The crust was very thin and the selection we made, while very tasty, was not a good value.  Definitely a family friendly restaurant, lots of little ones.

The service has always been first-rate and friendly, however, so I give them two stars. I ordered their pepperoni & sausage pizza, for which they charge $13.00.  It had very little pepperoni, not much more sausage, and was simply not worth it.  Previously I have had their spaghetti with meat sauce, which is undistinguished, and their fried mac & cheese, which is over-spiced.   If you want good pizza in SLO, I highly recommend Woodstock's Pizza, which is just a couple of blocks away from CPK, but serves much better pizza, albeit in a less fancy place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=60,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.0800000000000005,2.96

There was only one guy working the bar, and with him running back and forth, taking orders, and making drinks, the wait was even longer. I'm letting it slide since it wasn't his fault that he was the only one. I've had their pasta with asparagus and tomatoes, their jambalaya, and various pizzas. They've all been pretty good. Since it is a chain restaurant, the food rarely varies from other CPKs I've been to. I've also had their mojitos and this delicious chocolate hot alcoholic drink.

I could taste a faint lime in the cream sauce. It was pretty bland and disappointing. It did help to add a lot of salt... His pizza was pretty bland too. The only think I liked was the texture of the pizza dough part and crust. I wouldn't get the pizza just for the dough texture, though. - the crust was fluffy/chewy and not hard like some other pizza.

The salads arrived and I asked for the pizza to be heated more. They took it away and brought it back after awhile and it was still barely warm, the cheese was even set and gummy. I asked twice for parmesan cheese and almost gave up on that arriving but it finally did. It wasn't terribly busy there, I have eaten there when the line was out the door and the food was great.

57,Christine G.,"San Diego, CA",0,41,8.0,3.0,2015-03-29,"Update to our review below: 04/09/2015 We received a call from the manager, Jordan, after posting this review. He handled our concerns seriously and professionally. He was disappointed in the service and assured us that he would address the issues that we experienced. He clearly feels that customer service should be a priority at his restaurant. I definitely felt much better following his call and increased our original star rating from a one star to a three star rating specifically because of my conversation with Jordan.  Initial review: We stopped here on a road trip for dinner.  We have eaten at CPK restaurants before and expected a similar experience.  Oh boy did this restaurant NOT meet our expectations. Once we sat down, our waitress was unfriendly from the start. After our family ordered, I decided to add a salad to our meal. She had just walked away and began to input our order into the system when I went over and asked to add a salad to the order. She looked annoyed and bothered. Once our food was delivered (not by the waitress, but by another staff member), she NEVER checked on us. She stood by the bar and loudly talked about some penicillin reaction (in great detail) she'd had recently with other wait staff while we were eating. This was not really what we wanted to hear during our meal. I'm sure the other customers within earshot felt the same. In fact, there were so many servers standing around talking with each other and not serving customers that we were pretty surprised by the whole atmosphere in the restaurant.  The waitress did show up at the end of our meal to hand us our check. We were paying for part of the meal with a gift card. My husband had the gift card on an app on his phone. Therefore, he had to hand the waitress his phone to scan the gift card. She made a comment to another server (loudly enough for us to hear it) that she didn't like when customers used apps for gift cards because then she had to take their phones. When we were walking out, the host asked us how our visit was. We shared that we felt like the customer service from the waitress was less than satisfactory. Instead of trying to rectify the situation with a manager, he just said that he'd let the waitress know that we weren't happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=20,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.0840000000000005,3.5200000000000005

After the first group of two people who put their names in well after us were seated we started to question it but waited. After waiting for 30 minutes and 5 groups of people seated who came in after us, I went up to the front desk. The air head girls one named Gracie, and a shorter Hispanic girl, who were working seemed completely flustered with their easy job. So I asked if there was a reason that many people had been seated before us. She claimed that she had said our name...bullshit!

The hostess fetched us waters immediately upon arrival and our waiter Hannah delivered the most attentive and personable service we've ever had at CPK. (or ever had anywhere-- love!) My 4 year olds even hugged her at the end. Refills were prompt, she seemed more than happy to help my vegetarian husband who has a nut, and dairy allergy, and was constantly on the move making sure we were always O.K.

During today's visit we were served by Lynn. Immediately we were greeted by an authentic smile and warm & kind demeanor from her. She was incredibly informed on the menu, including any and all food & drink specials and had no hesitation answering any questions we may have had. She gave us a comfortable amount of time to decide on our meals, and did not rush our decision-making nor did she disappear once we were ready to order. While the meals were being prepared, I reveled in delight at the creative display my Sangria Flight demonstrated; a careful concoction crafted by the bartender. My husband chose the Moscow Mule and he said it tasted delightful. The restaurant was very clean, as were the bathrooms (which is of great importance to me!) We did not have to wait long for our food, and once it arrived it was exquisite in every way I remembered. I ordered my personal favorite; the Pear & Gorgonzola Pizza. My husband ordered one of the new lunch specials they offer-the BBQ Chicken Pizza & side salad.  All in all the service was excellent, the food was amazing & the atmosphere was clean & inviting.

40,Michael C.,"Santa Monica, CA",54,31,,1.0,2016-11-24,"I came into the California Pizza Kitchen in San Luis Obispo, CA about a month ago. On the same day, I had called ""George"" the General Manager expressing two concerns. The first one being the host telling me the bar was closed when in fact it was not, and there were people sitting there ordering/eating food. The second concern was that I ordered a Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza (minus some ingredients, thus having just a chicken pizza), and the server, Crystal, made an arbitrary change to the order, thinking she would save me $1 off the cost of the type of pizza. As I expressed to George, Crystal's heart might have been in the right place, however she was not thinking clearly that I ordered a specific pizza for a reason, and that if the $1 savings was of significant value to me, I would have found another restaurant down the street and gotten a slice of pizza for ~$3. Again, if I had more time that day, I would have sent the pizza back to the kitchen for remake, but I did not, therefore over half the pizza was wasted. At the conclusion of this telephonic conversation with George, he advised me that he would send me some gift cards to make up for the poor service his staff exhibited to me. These gift cards were never received. On or about November 12, 2016, I had a second telephonic conversation with George stating that I never received the first set of gift cards allegedly sent out on October 29, 2016. While he did recall the circumstances around the matter at hand, he did confirm that the first set of gift cards had not come back to him undeliverable via U.S. Mail, and he further stated he would send out a second set of gift cards via FedEx to ensure I would be getting them. These gift cards were never received. In short, two phone calls later after the incident, I've come to the conclusion that he is telling me what I may want to hear, but the follow up has failed. I find it really hard to believe that he has sent two sets of gift cards and they ""have been lost in the mail."" I've written a letter to George and the corporate office to documented some potential unethical behavior from the management of this restaurant. It's sad that a patron of over 20 years has to endure, let alone document this poor experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-luis-obispo?start=20,3.6,3.37,3.37,,3.462

My favorite in the Moroccan Chicken Salad. Chunks of tender beets, butternut squash and grilled chicken make this one a treat.

They have had a Blood Orange one that is not usually in the slight, but I have added it in on occasion. They are not a typical sangria and they are well made by the bartenders!!  So far everything we have ordered has been very tasty and a winner. The soups are very tasty. The market vegetable soup and smashed pea soup are delicious. I have had the chinese chicken salad, kung pao spaghetti, creamy garlic fettuccini with added mushrooms, wild mushroom pasta dish (forgot name), BBQ chicken pizza and mushroom pizza. I ordered them all the the thin crispy crust. Everything is always on point, hot and tasty. The staff so far have all been friendly and quick. We have gone when it is fairly busy, but have never felt neglected or we waited too long for food. The desserts are also great. The butter cake is good, but I think my favorite is the salted caramel pudding. YUMMO! If you have not tried CPK and think it is JUST pizza...try it!

The immense variety and diversity of really good eating establishments in SLO are a true benefit of living in this town. The fact that a corporate giant such as California Pizza Kitchen has a restaurant in this town is testament that the place is worthy. So we have now enjoyed three dinners here we haven't been disappointed. The sangria samplers are a favorite to get things flowing. Interesting menu offerings tempted our palette on each occasion kung pao spaghetti, shrimp scampi zucchini, and my favorite Jambalaya Fettuccini. I also prefer a thin crust pizza which can be ordered as an alternative to their original hand tossed crust. Dessert of course to end on a sweet note...the winner is the butter cake a la mode. The service has been great! Our special requests have always been granted.  In fact we've been so pleased that we are now members of the CPK frequent diner club.

Baked bread and oil for dip had been offered while we waited for the order (the mushroom pizza for me, pepperoni for husband and fried chicken with broccoli for the little) and we accepted. Unfortunately our food arrived before the bread did but to his credit our food server brought it out anyway. I much enjoyed the variety of mushrooms on my food as well as the blended cheeses.

They came with two dipping sauces here, ranch and chipotle, but everything about it was just bland. Same goes for the mac and cheese bites... the plate has four bites in a similar chipotle sauce, yet it still tasted dry and bland. The server seemed like being there was the last place she wanted to be....I don't blame her but you're not supposed to show it to your customers.  Only highlight of that meal was the strawberry mango cooler I got.

That said, I still love to come for the barbeque chopped chicken salad.  It hasn't changed much over the years, the ingredients are the same, but different. So, instead of chopped jicama, for example,  it's now shredded. They also don't have the original chopped salad at all. That was a bit of a drag.
