Nicole M.,"Montgomery, IL",0,21,7,5.0,12/24/2016,"We had dinner here last night and it was superb! My husband and I took out both of our parents for dinner before a show and we had just excellent service. I can't recall our server's name, but she was younger (short brown hair and glasses). Very sweet and patient. Food was awesome, but when service is great, it really makes the experience wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20
Davina R.,"Des Plaines, IL",21,7,,1.0,1/28/2017,"I had the worst service at the Chili's in Rosemont on Mannheim Rd this evening.  We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday and the service was AWFUL!  We had Kiera (or was it Keisha?) as our server and she was terrible.  I don't know how she works as a waitress.  She took forever to tend to us.  When she finally did get our drink orders and bring them out, we waited for approximately 15 minutes before she came back to even that appetizer/food orders.  Then she disappeared for about another 15 minutes or so with the appetizers,  but didn't bring us any plates.  We asked for plates and that took forever to get.  We ended up asking another server for some.  Then our drinks were all empty and she was gone for so long that we were almost done with our appetizers before we even got drink refills.   Ridiculous!  Then when we finally got our food, the fajitas I ordered were a joke!  They used to be generous with the serving and the meat.  You get a significant amount less than you used to, then to top it off literally about 50%-60% of my fajitas were onions.  I'm all for onions in my fajitas, but if I order steak and shrimp fajitas, I don't expect to only receive about 6 small slivers of beef and about 7 mini shrimp with less than a 1/4 of a bell pepper with a plethora of onions.  Talk about being screwed over.  That was  $14.99 and I didn't even this it was worth even half of that price. Between the awful service and the skimpy over priced meal, I have no intention to return there.  They have definitely lost a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20
Cara L.,"Chicago, IL",0,34,27,1.0,7/5/2017,"One of my worst restaurant experiences ever! We used to go to this place once in a while for a weeknight meal and some drinks.  Not a special occasion place for me, but good comfort food. This was definitely my last visit. We came on a Thursday (about a month ago). Despite the half empty place, there was still a handful of people waiting for a table. Strange. Plus the whole place looked somewhat in disarray and disorganized. We were seated  10 min later and I ordered a Margarita (which was to be a special that day) only to learn that the promotion ended at 7:00 PM although nowhere in my e-mail or even the flier on the table was this mentioned (and we were seated at 7.15). When I confronted the manager about it (Jose, I think, was his name), he was very rude and condescending and pretty much told me in a rather hostile way that I was wrong! What happened to the ""customer is always right"" policy, especially when customer is right! (and believe me, I usually like my food and I'm not a complainer). If it wasn't for the fact that I have already ordered my drink and my husband and I were both starving, we would have left and never looked back. We decided instead to make it our last visit at this place (at least as long as Jose is managing it) and just make the best of it. On the positive note: our waitress was nice and polite and somewhat embarrassed by this whole ordeal, so she deserves the one star which I had to give out, anyway. Never coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20
Courtney Z.,"Niles, IL",82,5,2,1.0,12/6/2015,The service her is slow we waited a while to be seated and the place was empty. Very unprofessional. With and empty restaurant they seat everyone on top of each other it would be nice to be a little spread out so that we aren't so close to other families if the option is available I understand we are in a public place and it could be busy at times and it's avoidable but at 3 in the afternoon when its empty I think they could give us some space even when asked. After ordering and receiving our food we spoke with our waitress only to find that this establishment does not provide heat resistant gloves  to them when they serve hot plates so they burn their hands. We're also told that one girl burned her ear and side of her face from a hot plate while carrying a tray that she was made to lift to a certain height.  On the bright side we liked our waitress our food was good and our drinks stayed full. However still only getting one star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20

I went inside and waited for 5-7minutes and not one person acknowledged that I was waiting.I then stepped over to the bar and asked the bartender if I were in the correct area to order togo, and he stated yes I will send someone over. I went back and waited another 6-7 minutes still not one person acknowledged that I was waiting. I stepped back over to bar and asked if someone was on the way. The bartender said oh you haven't been serviced yet? I said no he then proceeds to look around as if he were looking for someone to help. I then told him I was leaving that's when he stated well I can take your order ummmmmm why didn't you do that the first time?!?

The second time we came our experience was about the same...  reliable but just alright.  We will probably be back at some point, but I honestly would rather try something new and chance having to log-on and leave a bad review than to go to a place like this and be guaranteed I will be leaving a mediocre one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20
Daniel C.,"Orlando, FL",158,362,54,5.0,7/31/2014,"I love you chili's.  I had a quick trip to the airport to drop a friend off.  She and i decided to pop into chili's for the delicious triple dipper.  We had a great server who understood that we wanted to be quick.  She was personable, quick and funny.  I wish I had gotten her name.  Chili's has a table side computer tablet style product where you can pay your bill, get a receipt, request the server to come to the table and play games.  It's 2 miles from the airport so if you're on your way there you can always stop by and get a quick bite to eat.    I recommend the triple dippers! 3 of your favorite appetizers.  The server who was great recommends them too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20

Gage N.,"Des Plaines, IL",2,25,5,1.0,4/16/2016,"This place is officially the worst restaurant I have ever had to deal with in my life. My personal experience but I have to say it a second time, the worst restaurant I have ever dealt with in my entire life. From when I was born until now. I can think of a few memorable incidents I've had at other restaurants and this place blew all of those out of the water.  The main issue is the service. It's beyond horrible. It's horrendous and despicable. The employees here are the most incompetent bunch of people I have ever seen. I'm not sure if incompetency is contagious here or if it's simply a requirement to get a job, but to put it in a very nice way (for their benefit) if you order 3 things, they'll forget one of them completely and the other two will surely be wrong. Not even remotely close to what you ordered.  I challenge anyone reading this to test this out for themselves.  I have been in here several times and have been so disgusted with the staff I have vowed to never step foot into any Chili's ever again! As an example, the last time I was here, I ordered a burger for take out, I came in to pick it up and after being ignored for a whopping 20 minutes despite the fact the restaurant wasn't busy at all, I only saw one table of 4 people and it was during the week around 4pm in the afternoon, anyway, there was an employee at the pick up counter not even five feet away from me who completely ignored me for ten minutes before walking away like I wasn't there, when she clearly saw me but just didn't care I guess. Didn't see her again, at least not until 3-4 other employees all saw me waiting and no one came over to even ask if I was being helped, I didn't see anyone doing their job. My blood was boiling and I was raging at this point and just wanted to leave. Finally that girl comes back, no apology for making me wait, just demands my phone number and name. I see someone from the back hand her a styrofoam box (presumably my food). I saw her opened it (I thought to make sure it's actually my order) but was too far away to see the food myself, she proceeds to bag it for me and hands it to me and I left, telling myself I will never return here.  So I get home, open the styrofoam box and am greeted with the most vile and disrespectful meal I have ever been served. My burger had no buns, no lettuce, no cheese, no anything. It was just a patty with what looked like a bite was taken out of it? Maybe not, maybe it was just a piece that was broken off and a tomato, but definitely not the definition of a burger.  I was fuming!  I drove back for an explaination and was greeted with hostility even from the manager who was called after I wanted a refund. They refused to give me a refund because according (to the manager at the time) I had left the restaurant so it's not their problem. In the end he ""offered"" to fix my order and give me coupons for future visits and I basically told him to shove his coupons where the sun doesn't shine and he finally gave me my money back. NEVER again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20
jean h.,"Des Plaines, IL",1,115,2,1.0,6/13/2015,Meh - We ordered on line. I had the Smoked Chicken Quesadillas.  I paid for but did not receive the side a guacamole or sour cream. It was supposed to have caramelized onions. Funny I found almost raw purple onions on it - like they pulled it off of a salad. One triangle wedge had nothing in it    no chicken and no cheese.  The beans tasted like they were from the dollar store and the rice from the trash bin out back. Salsa was so cold it had to have been in the fridge. Chips had no salt.

The only thing that tasted good here was the chips and salsa and my chicken. The fries were not fresh and the corn you can tell had been sitting. Service was good.

Isabella K.,"Chicago, IL",1,23,,3.0,1/23/2015,"I used to love coming to this location. It wasn't too far of a drive from where I live and there is always parking. Unless there is something going on at the Allstate Arena, then that alters the parking and getting out situation a bit.  My last visit, I was there with my significant other, and while we were seated rather quickly, the service- rather a lack there of- was disappointing. We were seated and promptly given out utensils rolled in napkins, and told our server would be with us shortly. From that second, up until we left, we had maybe 6 different servers pass by us, and glance at our direction- but not approach us to see if we were being taken care of.  I get it, they have a policy that if utensils are placed, the table is being served, but when we did not even have our drinks and we were watching the waiters go by, note to those waiters, take a hint that something is not right. Who knows, your tip may just be bigger because of that- and if you become our server. (I speak from experience, I have been a waitress before and I know what it means to earn that tip).  Needless to say, when we stood up to leave, we approached and asked for a manager to notify why we were leaving. At that moment not only did the I believe GM offer to keep us there and provide our food, but another manager offered as well. We turned them down, because we did not need to be served in pity.  That location will not be visited by my and my friends for a long time, I am still disappointed to this day about that location- and Chili's is my favorite place to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20

Bobby O.,"Chicago, IL",312,257,187,4.0,11/30/2014,As a first timer I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant does have a partitioned bar area where one can watch sports and chow down.

Penguin S.,"Houston, TX",140,713,169,4.0,9/10/2010,"It's hard to write a review for a huge chain. They know what they are doing and don't really mess up much.  Having said that, I got the skillet queso and it appeared to be about 8 hours old sitting in a crock pot over cooking. Great, crispy chips, tho. Cheese fries are about as good as they come, and they know to bring ranch.  Southwest egg rolls are NOM! Buffalo chicken nuggets (sorry, I don't think there is such a thing as boneless wings) were good as well. Can't go wrong with fried cheese.  Love the chicken fajitas and that they serve them with cheese. It's amazing how well cheese can spice up a fajita.

The place was beyond busy. It was ridiculously busy, but our server did a decent job of taking care of us. She was kind of odd as it seemed like she was reading from a script or something, Maybe she was just brain dead from dealing with the swarms of Metallica fans that were invading the place that night. .  I ordered some chicken tacos and it seems like the entire meal was slightly overcooked.

Jesse W.,"Midlothian, IL",137,109,10,3.0,3/7/2008,"Chili's is my guilty pleasure: one of my favorite mid-scale fast food restaurant chains.  There are probably a dozen or so in the Chicagoland area, and I've been to a few around the nation, too.  I haven't had a bad experience yet, which is quite a compliment when compared to my other visits to TGI Friday's or Bennigan's.  Unfortunately, this was my worst experience yet. Tonight's meal was my first meal back in America after a 3 month stint in China.  Why Chili's?  1) It's one of my fav chains, as stated earlier.  2) It's mighty close to O'Hare.  3) It's open until 11 p.m. Mon.-Thurs. -- perfect for a 9:30 p.m. arrival.  4) Main reason: I wanted a decent hamburger from a quick, consistent, nearby stop. Our party sat down, and were given a few minutes to order.  We finally ordered a full round of waters, 4 other drinks, appetizers, food, and desserts.  Waters were only given to a select few.  Food was brought out within a decent time.  No utensils or plates were at our table, and none were offered with our appetizers.   All was not downhill though.  Chili's, with no assistance from our waitress, gave my palate a delightful tour of what a bacon burger should taste like. My Southern Smokehouse Bacon Big Mouth Burger arrived at my table, as advertised: ""Extra thick-cut brown sugar & chile-rubbed bacon topped with smoked cheddar cheese, crispy onion strings, mayo, shredded lettuce, tomato and pickle. Served with ancho-chile BBQ sauce on the side.""  Although I couldn't order my burger medium-rare, I was not that unhappy since this seems to be the industry norm among national chains.  Either I truly missed bacon by being in China for so long, or this was honestly some of the thickest, tastiest bacon to ever bestow itself upon my tongue.  I wanted extra ancho-chile BBQ sauce, but my waitress hardly seemed worried about how much I was enjoying my meal.  She seemed more interested in completing her closing duties so she could leave on time.  At least my friends and family also seemed to enjoy their food. I sampled the Molten Chocolate Cake, and Frosty Chocolate Shake.  Both were decent.  I was slightly disappointed, however, when one of my friends couldn't order a vanilla shake.  Only chocolate shakes here, fellas. Overall, service SUCKED at this location, but Chilis' new burger creations and reliable food will keep me coming back.  A better customer service experience could have easily placed my review of this location at 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=80

Melissa L.,"Woodridge, IL",0,49,3,3.0,1/1/2013,"Not horrible, but not really impressed either. I took my mother to the Harlem Globetrotters game as her Christmas present so we decided to grab some dinner first. We were sat nearly immediately in a booth. Our server greeted us extremely promptly. There was something kind of off about her, she was rather awkward like she was uncomfortable, I'm thinking she was new? I think she was foreign, her name was Karolina or something. Anyways the service was alright, not great but pretty good. She kept refilling my drink and my mother's margarita was fantastic. Here comes the trouble, our food took really long, I'm assuming it's because it was a Friday night but still 25 minutes for a medium steak and some pasta? When our food finally arrived the steak was past well done, like I am talking no pink in sight and rather dry and flavorless. The cajun chicken pasta was delicious though, I definitely recommend it. The manager offered to replace the steak but we had no time so he comped it off our bill. All in all not a great experience but the drinks were good and our server may have been a little weird but she was extremely nice and she didn't pull the disappearing act like so many servers do so three stars and I'm hopeful that next time I am in the area my experience will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=80

Natalie S.,"Des Plaines, IL",25,14,29,4.0,7/30/2014,"This place may not seem all that special, but I recommend Chili's for a great dinner for several different reasons. 1) Please do not underestimate the ability of Chili's to produce an amazing burger! They really are great. The one to really try is the southern smokehouse burger. It comes with their ancho-chili bbq sauce, onion strings, smoked cheddar, and maple bacon. Cooked to order and it is so delicious!  2) They have other very delicious food, especially the guacamole. You can order it to be prepared right at your table. Although i personally haven't tried the sizzling fajitas, they also look great, (brought to your table still sizzling in the cast iron pan) and the chicken  sandwich is really good. MY ADVICE TO SAVE MONEY! : **This place is definitely not all that cheap for a chain restaurant, so if you go in, make sure to bring with you a coupon (either printed or on your phone screen) for a free appetizer of chips and salsa or chips and queso dip that you get just by signing up on their website (takes five seconds). This makes your experience a little more worthwhile because you at least get some yummy food to munch on while you wait, and the chips and salsa are bottomless. **If you go with a friend, order from the two for twenty menu (you each get an entrée and share an appetizer). Even though it only offers the maple bacon burger, my solution to this has been to simply ask for a side of bbq sauce and order the onion strings and  jalapeño appetizer (delicious and comes with an amazing dipping sauce), save a few strings and jalapeños for the entree, and put them on the burger! Voila! You have just ordered the same burger for less money because you also got the appetizer, lol **You can also substitute sweet potato fries for the regular fries for something like a dollar or fifty cents. They are amazing! **You get a free molten cake on your birthday. You don't know gluttonous heaven until you eat this beast. *Really, make sure to sign up for their mailing list on their site. They send so many good deals, like free appetizers, desserts, and kids meals. You can't go wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=40

Claire M.,"Forest Park, IL",145,353,392,2.0,2/5/2012,"So this night had been a plan in the making for over a month.  I was all excited about it and naturally because of that, was greatly disappointed.  Here's why.   We were going to a wolves game with a group of people and a few of us decided to meet at Chili's to grab something to eat before the game which started at 7.  Last year, we came and ate after the game and had such a good time we decided to repeat history.   I'd never really been much into Chili's but I got a gift card from a coworker for Christmas and was pleasantly surprised by the one in North Riverside (see that review for the GOODness) and was thrilled to go back so I could enjoy 1) Diet Dr Pepper from the fountain (we don't keep soda at home anymore and any time I can enjoy it is a huge deal) and 2) savor their delicious grilled veggie tacos.   Now I don't know if Chili's has changed that much in a short time since I was there with my holiday gift card (and once since then) or if the one in Rosemont just sucks way more BUT... This one did NOT have the extensive fountain drink selection that the one in North Riverside has/had.  You could get any combination of beverage imaginable.  Peach flavored Sprite among many other choices!  So right off the bat, I was saddened that I was not going to get my Diet Dr. Pepper.  The grilled veggie tacos had also been removed from the menu.  Shit.  I'm a vegetarian so I ended up having to eat a house salad.  No French dressing.  No Italian dressing.  They did have a citrus vinaigrette (sp?) which was good.  It just really stink to go out to eat and have like ONE option.  I love salad, but it'd be nice if that wasn't my ONLY choice.  And I had been craving those damn tacos for weeks!   Now, for the other less than stellar aspect which in part, was not the fault of Chili's.  Our party of 6 arrived at 5:15pm and the Wolves game started at 7.  I figured we'd be cutting it close and expected it to be quite crowded.  So we get our pager at 5:15 and were told it would be a 30 to 45 minute wait.  Cool.  Right at 6:00 (45 minutes later) our pager still had not gone off.  My affable Italian coworker (god bless him) approached the host stand in his usually charming way to ask if our table would be ready soon.  Mind you, they knew we were a party of 6 and had waited the maximum wait time they had given us.  They offered to spit us up between 2 booths, 3 at each and the booths weren't even close to each other!  Initially we said fine, since we were hungry and had to get to the game.   As we walked back to the booths, we noticed a HUUUUUUUGE group of people who were seated at tables pushed together that ran almost the entire length of one side of the place!  They had begun standing up and had their coats on so we asked if we could wait and sit at one of the longer tables they'd been occupying so all 6 of us could socialize, as was our plan the entire time.   Apparently these people had been there since 4:30 and it was now 6:15.  This was actually pretty funny because we were standing there awkwardly, staring at them (as if that was going to make them move faster) watching these old women look through a photo album and take forever to say goodbye to each other.   FINALLY enough of them moved so that one longer table could be turned back around and we sat elbow to elbow.    The dear manager brought us out complimentary chips with queso and salsa which was very nice.  I'm a very easy going person and wasn't much bothered by the waiting/seating situation.  A couple of the people I was with, however, were quite annoyed.  I'm a very go with the flow person and felt kinda bad about their obvious displeasure.   My only disappointments (and I guess personally, they were pretty major because I was specifically looking forward to the things they did not have) were with not having the food and drink I had planned to order and then lack of another option besides the house salad.   I will stick with North Riverside from now on and hope that they NEVER take away the endless drink options and grilled veggie tacos.  =(   As for the food of my dining companions, they enjoyed theirs very much.  And we made it to the game right on time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=40

Mike O.,"Park Ridge, IL",177,690,437,4.0,11/1/2012,"I've been coming here for years and even had the impression I had written about the place, but apparently I did not. This is a very busy Chili's, always packed when there's something happening at Allstate Arena. Still, it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner on a special occasion like a birthday or special treat for the kids on a job well done.  Best time to come is lunch on a Saturday or Sunday, as there is no wait usually and there's plenty of good tables or booths to choose from. While Chili's is a chain, at the same time it's got plenty of food choices for kids and grownups too. And the food is good too. They introduce new items and keep old faves I've come to love over the years. My #1 favorite is the jalapeno smokehouse burger, bringing a mix of spicy jalapenos and creamy ranch sauce on the burger, for a spicy-mellow combination. There are many other burger choices too, especially if you like bacon. My wife always goes with steak fajitas, and that fajita platter is big enough for 2, so we often bring tortillas and DIY fajita stuff home afterwards. For the kids, there's about a dozen choices available. Pizza is a frequent favorite, and Chili's pizza isn't bad for a thin crust, but by no means on a stellar level you'd get at Lou Malnati's or Gino's, but kids don't seem to care. Sides of corn on the cob, fries or fruit are available too. If you still got room for dessert and aren't at risk for cardiac problems, try the molten chocolate volcano at the end. It's big enough to split with 2-3 people unless you want to win the golden pig-snout trophy all for yourself. Once again, the texture and flavors of chocolate cake, hot fudge and melting vanilla ice cream make it a sensational choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60

Because we wanted to see the Chicago Wolves game at 7pm we were going to be in Rosemont anyway and there was a Chili's right across the parking lot from the Allstate Arena.  When the football game started we were seated in a booth in the bar and we ordered lunch, usual Chili's stuff. The food was fine but the service was excellent.  They didn't care that 1, we came in with bags straight from the airport and 2, we sat in there the entire game for 3.5 hours. Meanwhile the Wolves game was starting to attract a lot of pre-gamers and the place was packed. The staff never gave us the evil eye or anything. I really thought that at some point they'd ask us to leave because we hadn't ordered anything in over an hour and they totally could've used our booth for another party. I'm super glad they let us stay in there and continued to bring us free refill after free refill of soda because we got to see one of the most exciting NFL playoff endings in recent history.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60

You Kno W.,"Chicago, IL",0,25,,1.0,5/23/2011,"Loud. Extremely loud.  Do we REALLY need that many TV screens in a restaurant?   Service?  Marginal...we had to go in search of the waitress in order to pay the bill.  I will say, however, that the (male) manager was roamingly attentive and filled our glasses once. My salad was wilted and watery.  My companions' meals seemed better --- good chicken sandwich and unimpressive but not overdone salmon and broccoli.  Still, WHY put yourself through this when there are a dozen similarly priced restaurants with better food and atmosphere in the area?  At least, that's my take on things...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60
Alex M.,"Chicago, IL",1,28,,4.0,11/18/2014,The three times I have been to Chili's at this location the food has been very good. I was quite surprised the first we went there.

Ericka A.,"Chicagoland, IL",1239,1525,2754,4.0,10/25/2008,"OK, so based on food alone I would completely have given this Chili's 5 stars. You wouldn't necessarily expect a chain to provide you with the best of meals, but I was thoroughly impressed. My strawberry lemonade was delicious with extra strawberry taste without being too sweet. The chicken was tender and moist, but not watery, nor undercooked and everything that came with it perfectly complimented the meal. The crunchy, spicy chips added texture. The beans were both pureed and whole. The rice was large and plump. I was blown away. Service wasn't too bad. That's what brought it down a star. We had to wait 20 min for a table, which isn't surprising. Once the crowd mostly left we were still ignored for a good portion of our outing. We waited a while after we were ready to order and even longer when we wanted the bill. I would still come here again in a heartbeat if I can be guaranteed the same delicious chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60
Lisa B.,"Raleigh, NC",34,98,10,4.0,11/23/2010,"This is your standard Chili's.  The service is usually pretty good.  We've been here a few times when the service was pretty bad.  The place has always been clean and the hostess friendly. The drink specials are usually awesome and they don't taste watered down like some drink 'specials'.  We've had quite a few problems with the kitchen, but the servers were usually quick to correct them. My favorite thing to order is the unlimited chips and salsa.  The chips are always fresh and warm here.  I've always loved knowing that if nothing else, I'm going to get good chips. This location is doing a trial run on some electronic tablet at each table.  You can pay, you can order dessert and you can play games on it.  They also list specials.  It was kind of neat to try out and I'd like to see them roll it out to all locations. If you're near O'Hare and looking for a fast lunch, they have all you can eat soup, salad and chips.  I think it is about $7, so you can't beat that.  They also are pretty fast at lunch even when busy.   Overall, I like this place and I think for a chain they do pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60
Yakin Sal M.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",86,47,338,5.0,8/5/2017,"It was my first time at a chillis restaurant. Yes it's hard to believe since they have been around for quite some time. The truth is that I always try to stay away from chain restaurants. Only because they are over priced and their food and drinks tend to not be good. I has the house margarita and yes it was sweeter than cracking open a lemonade. But we got the dinner for two for $35. I was there with my roommate. We each had a margarita and shared an appetizer. The Texas cheese fries, they were good. Came with melted cheese and bacon topped with jalapeños accompanied with ranch dressing. Very tasty I'd say. I had the chicken fajitas, I think it could've used a bit more chicken rather than a mountain of veggies but the season was on point. So no complaining there. He had the half a slab of ribs. He said they were juicy and the flavor was also on point. Finally we shared the Oreo molten cake for dessert. If you love chocolate like I do that's the way to go. Nice warm cake topped with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with hot chocolate sauce and crushed Oreo cookies. All in all it was good dinner for two for $35.  P.s. Yelpers be sure to give them a try and select their special. It really makes a difference if you are on a budget.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont

Jim J.,"Park Ridge, IL",2103,247,732,3.0,9/22/2017,"This Chili's is pretty decent compared to chain wide standards.  They seem to be making a solid effort to stay relevant by adding craft beers, more trendy food items and remodeling their restaurants.  This location got the makeover sometime in the last few year so it is looking new and hip - in a corporate way.  The seats are comfortable and the place is spacious, yet not too loud.  We have always had great servers and they keep drink refills coming.  Be sure to place an order for your favorite Coke concoction on the freestyle machine. The food is what you would expect for a fast causal restaurant.  They have a huge selection of apps, but we always opt for the bottomless tortilla chips.  The chips are freshly fried and come with a zesty salsa.  You can get refills of the basket of chips (don't be embarrassed, people do it all the time).   I rarely am hungry by the time my food comes out.  Salads and burgers are both pretty reliable, but terrible for you.  The health stats they publish online are a little concerning to say the least.  I had the Chipotle Chicken and Waffles on my last visit and feel it missed the mark.  The chicken was tiny little stringy pieces with a lot of batter.  The waffle was super sweet in an overkill manner.  It was all covered with a spicy chipotle syrup that kind of covered everything up.  I ate two of them and got rid of the rest - good thing I filled up on the chips and salsa. I will stick to fajitas or burgers in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont
Olivia R.,"Niles, IL",27,166,194,4.0,6/18/2017,"So i came here hungry! Like really hungry. The food was tasty and it satisfied my pregnant appetite  the trio fajitas (double shrimp and chicken) was really good! My husband had sunrise burger-was tasty and met the expectations of a picky burger eater. My daughter had chicken quesadilla (her go to food) and she was happy with it since she finished it.  However, i do not understand why we waited so much time for our food to come out. We waited for 30min on a Sunday at 2pm. The place had a lot of empty tables therefore the kitchen couldn't have been busy.  ***Also, Chill's are taking out items off their menu but the printed menu doesn't mention that or it's not updated yet.***",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont

Eric E.,"Des Plaines, IL",10,235,11,4.0,7/18/2016,"Decent meal at our local Chili's! We went for a 2 for $20 meal, and enjoyed Chips & Salsa, Fajita and the grilled chicken salad. The prices was very good, the chips and salsa OK at best, but ample and predictable. If you like finessed chips and salsa, this is not the place to go. The fajitas were decent as well. Good flavor, hot and sizzling, and enough to take some for another meal! The chicken salad was also a good portion. The lime vinaigrette dressing was actually very tasty. Service was decent, if not great. Our server seemed a bit tentative and lacked enthusiasm, but he was there for our drink refills and was mostly prompt in checking we had what we wanted. Overall, a decent Chili's chain experience. Better than some, and a good meal in Rosemont.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont
Amy W.,"Harvard, IL",5,4,1,4.0,8/17/2017,"This visit was significantly better than the last, partially due to the fact that we were actually seated at one of the many empty tables (unlike  the last, when an entire empty section plus more meant '20 minute wait).

Laura N.,"Georgetown, KY",1193,1006,4237,3.0,5/13/2015,"Mango-Chile Tilapia with rice and steamed veggies --- what an amazing healthy meal to order here at Chili's after having too many unhealthy options for days. Yummmmgasm. I salivate now just thinking about that meal.  And that meal is about the only thing I like about this Chili's. The service itself wasn't bad -- we were just crammed together (five of us) at a corner table meant for four with the nearby tables being wayyyyy too close. If anyone had to go to the bathroom, basically all of us had to stand up to make room for someone to leave the table. It was annoying. And yet... we were stuck here. Price is OK. You'll be fine if you do the two meals for $20 thing.... and order water. Unless you have money to spend, then by all means, order away and drink to your heart's content. Menu is pretty typical of chains like Chili's -- burgers, fish, steaks, fries, drinks, etc. etc.  Not really my first choice for dinner..... .... but that tilapia. Man.

Axel F.,"Des Plaines, IL",7,9,,3.0,5/14/2017,"I work close to this Chili's and they do have really good food. I will say that their prices are a bit steep, for example added a side of Mac n cheese is a 3.50 surcharge? That seems a bit excessive. I might understand it if you were getting a large portion like an entire entree of it but paying that much for what is essentially a cup of noodles cheese and some seasoning is kind of ridiculous.  I don't actually eat in though I've always ordered food to go. Which is great when the restaurant is slow and they receive my order. I can walk right in, pay and leave. However on several occasions they never put in my order which is a big inconvenience as I eat on my lunch break. They've comped the meal before, given me coupons, and they were always apologetic don't get me wrong. That's all well and good but you still need to fix the problem. I was forgiving when it only happened on a rare occasion. But once it started happening a lot I was done. The whole point of ordering that way is that it's ready for someone when they go in. That's precisely why these to go services are so popular. Because we live in this time where people are in a hurry, they are interacting less, and they just want to get their greasy junk food (no offense) go home and watch some Netflix. It defeats the purpose when you have to sit there and wait for it.  Fix whatever issues you have with receiving to go orders and I'll change my review. The food and service is really good. I would love to eat there again if I could count on my food being ready.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont
