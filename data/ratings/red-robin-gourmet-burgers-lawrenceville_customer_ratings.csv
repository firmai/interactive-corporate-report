68,Paula M.,"Nashville, TN",13,235,150.0,2.0,2012-02-02,"Every now and then, I crave a burger. And every now and then when I crave a burger, I crave a Red Robin burger, complete with steak fries and a freckled lemonade. We were seated at the small two-seat booths near the kitchen. I never liked these seats but they weren't the worst thing about our experience. We ordered a shake and a freckled lemonade. Our server brought the drinks out but the left us with no straws. It was a few minutes before we saw him to get the straws. We ordered two burgers, one with regular fries and the other with sweet potato fries. One of the burgers was also ordered without tomato. Our burgers came out and the fries were with the wrong burgers. And there was tomato in the burger too! Our server seemed to check on us every time he passed by our booth, which was a lot because we were right next to the kitchen entrance. Our server offered a refill on sweet potato fries. We accepted and he walked off away from the kitchen and to another table. I assumed he needed to check on things before putting in the refill request. I didn't see him pass by for at least five minutes. And when he passed by, he checked on us as if we didn't accept the refill. He offered to bring the bill, while I was still only half way through my burger. He brought it shortly after and said, ""No rush."" Still eating my burger, we ignored the bill and tried to enjoy what was left of our meal. A minute later, the server returns to ask if he can take the bill. We said no. He returns a minute later and asks again. We said no. He returns another minute later. At this point, I'm just finishing my burger and eating my fries. We said no again. A few minutes later, I'm done with my meal and am ready to pay the bill. I stand it upright (classic sign that the bill is ready). He passes by and picks it up. When the server comes back with the bill to be signed, he leans on our table as if he wants to chat but doesn't say anything. He stutters a bit and then leaves. I don't get it. We left feeling rushed and unsatisfied. In retrospect, my burger was pretty good, but it was the service that made the lasting memory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=100,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

85,Angela S.,"Smyrna, GA",362,568,2415.0,4.0,2012-08-14,"The very first time I ate at a Red Robin was in L.A. - just a few weeks before I moved to Georgia!  My friends told me they couldn't believe I had never been to a Red Robin before.  After that first time, I was immediately a fan. Since then, I've signed up for the free Red Royalty card, which is their version of a frequent buyer card.  All you have to do is ask your server for a card, and then you have to register it online.  They offer cool deals like ""Buy 9 Get the 10th Free - Mix and match Fresh & Fire-grilled Burgers, Entrées & Salads.""  However, my favorite annual perk is the free burger you get during the month of your birthday!  It's become a tradition to take at least one of my siblings with me each year when I go to get my birthday burger.  =) Most recently, my three siblings and I went to this Red Robin around 3 pm on a Friday for my free birthday burger.  It didn't take me very long to decide which burger I wanted: the A.1.® Peppercorn burger cooked to medium temperature.  I also requested ranch and BBQ sauce to dip my ""unlimited"" fries in. * A.1.® Peppercorn Burger ($10.39) - Per the menu description, this ""gourmet"" burger is topped with ""hardwood-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A.1.® Peppercorn Spread, crispy onion straws and fresh tomatoes on an onion bun.""  Doesn't it sound good?  Yuuuum...  The burger patty itself was probably cooked closer to medium-well than medium.  Although it's not even close to as good as my favorite burger in Atlanta (Bocado!), I enjoyed the mixture of the various flavors and liked the onion bun!  The steak fries, which are served with the burgers, are ""bottomless"" so you can eat to your heart's content.  They aren't the most amazing fries ever, but sprinkle some of their seasoned salt, dip into your favorite sauces, and enjoy with your burger! My brother was such a fan of the fries that he got two refills of them!  They also had no problem providing more fries to take home.  I know most people are probably thinking, ""Who takes fries home?!""  Yes, we do.  (*Hint: Toaster ovens are magical!) Overall, this Red Robin deserves 3.5 stars because their burger isn't the greatest, but I'm rounding up to 4 stars for their awesome Red Royalty card and friendly service.  Red Robin's ""gourmet"" burgers certainly aren't cheap but not expensive, and who else offers ""bottomless steak fries""?  I wish there was a Red Robin closer to my house but since this one (almost 20 minutes away) is the closest, it'll have to do.  I'll continue to return to this Red Robin for birthdays (mine and my siblings') and occasions when I feel like pigging out on steak fries with a good burger.

The second time, also with her as well and she told me to sign up for a royalty rewards card so that on my next visit I'll recieve a free meal on my birthday! So I asked my waiter if I could get one of those royalty rewards card and once I did, I saw a sticker which said I could get a free appetizer within 14 days after I signed up. So I saved it and tried to use it the year after (this year), but they changed their promo and told me that the offer is now invalid. I was disappointed but I know it wasn't the waiter's fault that their policy changed. So here I was with my 3 siblings, we were seated right away in a booth. My sister, Angela H. used her birthday meal coupon and got her free meal and her diet coke.  **Bleu Ribbon burger - $9.99 Basted with a tangy steak sauce and topped with crumbled Bleu cheese.  Served with crispy onion straws, lettuce, fresh tomatoes and zesty chipotle mayo on an onion bun.** I had ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger which had bleu cheese crumbles on top of the beef. I don't remember the french fries being so flat and wide.. hmmm... maybe it's just me.. but I thought the fries were a lot thinner. Anyways, I'm not too big on fries, so I let my siblings chow on those. I had a few but wasn't crazy about the fries. I wasn't too big on the bleu cheese either, but my little brother was and so I ordered it just so that I could half it with him. I don't eat much.

The service:  we were a party of 18.  They were able to accommodate us all.  The server (Bob) was thorough with suggestions to each order.  Our glasses were never empty and neither were the French Fry baskets!

61,Dave P.,"Snellville, GA",0,84,5.0,2.0,2012-09-21,"So Snellville loses a Fuddruckers and gains a Red Robin.  Not a good trade off in my opinion. The Veggie Patty is pretty good.  I'm also impressed that they offer a 2nd ""vegan"" option (the Boca Burger, but it is just plain nasty - cardboard on the outside, but mushy on the inside), so I stick with the Veggie patty which has some cheese in it. I like to get the patty wrapped in lettuce in lieu of a bun. The fries are all you can eat steak fries, but I can only take a few.  Too thick, often too soft. Red Robin is more expensive than Fuddruckers was (and there is no ""fixins"" bar). Most employees are teenagers - most seem uninterested in their job, although we've had a couple really good waiters.  I guess the service is best described as ""hit or miss"". We eat here occasionally, but our visits usually remind me of how much I miss Fuddruckers (R.I.P.)  Unfortunately, my 11 year old daughter really likes Red Robin, so I'm sure we'll be back more often than I'd choose to eat here myself...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=100,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
16,Gino M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",38,342,79.0,2.0,2012-11-03,"Our Red Robin experience has, unfortunately, been more miss than hit.  We keep coming back because we've got a toddler and we hope to have a sit down meal in a place that's appealing to both him and the parents as well as friends.  Unfortunately the food quality continues to disappoint. On our most recent experience the first bad mark was that the place was HOT.  It's the middle of an afternoon on a Sunday and the manager was refusing to turn on the AC (according to our waiter).  We complained.  She said there was nothing to be done.  We complained again.  She said the manager didn't care.  We said we were leaving.  The manager turned the AC on.  It shouldn't have to go that far.  Admittedly this was in a cool September - but on a day with the highs in the low 80's, a place should have the AC on in Georgia.  It's expected.  Don't be cheap just because it's a Sunday afternoon. Finally - the food comes out: the wrong fries, toppings on the burger were wrong, kid's corn dog was burnt to a crisp, our pretzel appetizer had about half the nuggets compared to the picture, drinks took until the meal was half eaten to deliver ... Unfortunately it was the final straw.  There are too many other options in the suburban chain hell that is Gwinnett to eat at a bad one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
73,Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572.0,2.0,2012-12-20,"My friends and I went there one Thursday afternoon for lunch as it was not too far from our pool center after our workout. We were seated immediately as it was not too crowded then. Lucky us, I thought. Just wait for the real story to unfold in a minute. Our waiter went around our table of 4 and took our drink orders first. He came back shortly with our drinks but he did not put my hot beverage in a coffee mug. He said one of the other waiters had broken a tray of coffee mugs on Sunday. Excuse me, but it was 4 days ago. Shouldn't the mugs be replaced by now? So I get my hot beverage in a glass which I could not really hold on to drink or gulp. There was only one coffee mug in the entire restaurant which was given to my friend who had ordered hot tea. Then he went ahead and took our individual orders. We shared an appetizer together.  The appetizer of Towering Onion Rings came with tangy campfire sauce and ranch dressing for dipping. We were about to dig into the appetizer but we were missing our silverware. We waved down the waiter to bring us our silverware with napkins. The sweet yellow onion rings were crispy and right out of the fryer. Then comes our lunch entrees. We ordered a Caeser Salad with a bowl of Chicken Tortilla Soup. The salad was good and the chicken vegetable tortilla soup had Cheddar cheese topped with some sour cream and tortilla strips. My friend said it was alright. The other friend has The Royal Red Robin burger. It had bacon, American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. Also no complain from my friend. Another ordered the Bleu Ribbon Burger which came with Bleu cheese crumbles, onion straws, lettuce and tomatoes. My friend seemed to enjoy her meal too. Then I had my Sauteed Mushroom Burger which had melted Swiss cheese and a spread of garlic Parmesan spread for that extra Yumm. I enjoyed my burger as well. All the burgers range around $10 or so. We were pleased with what the kitchen staff had made.  Then the waiter came back to check on us and it was like a nightmare on Elm Street that started happening. He started to refill some of the glasses with iced tea. Then he started to pour iced tea on MY head. I thought if I was growing a plant on my head then. For a few minutes, he did not realized what he had done. I started to stand up hoping he could see me and stop pouring tea on me. All my friends were taken back and I tried not to make a scene in the restaurant. I sat back down but the waiter did not apologize. He immediately got embarrassed when I nudged him to stop watering my head with tea. He left and went for some extra napkins to bring to me. Then he said it was his birthday that day and he later came back with a pitcher of water. He told me to pour it on him. What?? Bwahhh! I wasn't going to do that tit for tat thing since I am way beyond my elementary schooling years. He kept asking me to pour water back at him. Then he went back to the kitchen and I was wondering what he was going to bring out next. The manager came out and apologized on behalf of the waiter. Manager asked if there is anything he could do to fix the situation. Immediately my 3 friends said I shouldn't have to pay for a bad experience at RR. I was going to pay for my meal in any case but the manager saw how my friends reacted and took the meal off my tab. The manager thought it was just water that the waiter poured on me but I told him it was sweet iced tea. I am a sweet person and I do not need any sweet tea, not on my head. Do you dig this, Mr. Manager? No coffee mug, no silverware, no ketchup for my friend and please stop pouring iced tea on your customer.  That was not quite the lunch I had anticipated from RR, coming from the birthday waiter guy. It was early in the afternoon and certainly too early for happy hours to begin. I kept drying my hair so no lettuces or tomatoes will grow from the tea pouring experience. Damn, I had never given a 2 stars to any restaurant. This will go down in history as one of my weirdest dining experience. I'm not saying I won't come back, maybe next time with a better wait staff to sweep me off my feet so I can forget this one.

Granted the place was full but 15-20 minutes to get drinks was unacceptable. Also, the food was slow in coming out.  My hamburger had a sweet flavor I did not like which maybe was  due to their relish.

I felt like the burgers were sitting there for awhile because the buns were soggy by the time it reached out table. Overall, food was just lacking flavor.  SERVICE was horrendous. Management needs to address this to the staff or hire better workers. Yes, you're friendly and smiling and letting us know to ask for whatever is needed, but please live up to it.

He was incredibly engaging, reaching out to us several times during the meal, chatting with us while we waited on the food, and first and foremost being honest with us when we sat down that due to how busy the restaurant was the food was going to take 20+ minutes to arrive. I can't tell you how much I appreciate honesty in a server -- if it's going to be a wait, I'll do a lot better if you tell me upfront, rather then giving out platitudes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=100,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.8000000000000003,2.92

Garlic Steak Fries?! Fried Onion rings?! Fried Mushrooms?! Fried Jalapenos Rings?! Fried Zucchini Sticks?! Fried Cheese Sticks?!!! Yes! Yes! Yes!  Granted, I might be on my way to an early death, but I'm oh-so-happy doing it! I don't come here often (see list of fried goodies), but I love it. Now the veggie options for the burgers are simply ""okay"". I never liked BOCA meat (Moringstar is the way to go!) BUT with enough toppings and condiments, I can handle it with a smile. The BOCA ""meat"" is thick (like maybe an inch or two) & pale & bland. The garden burger is very thin, and composed of various different things (ie. rice, olives, etc). But I usually do the same thing I do with the BOCA meat, I load it with veggies & condiments. Not too bad. I like that you can make any burger, a veggie burger. Fish & Chips: The cod fish is bland. I added some lemon & salt to it. The atmosphere is always fun & loud. The employees have always been very kind to me & co. & the restaurant is clean. Now price is kinda steep when you think about it (especially if you add an appetizer or two or three or....). Combos range from $9-$16. Appetizers range from $3-$9. I guess others don't share my love for all things fried. Red Robins I give you a solid 4 stars!

112,Richard R.,"Suwanee, GA",2315,1000,11015.0,4.0,2014-01-16,"I had absolutely no intentions of writing a review for Red Robin, but my last visit makes me want to properly thank them. MY FIRST VISIT MANY YEARS AGO We used to come to this location weekly when it first opened, long before my unpaid career on yelp began (LOL)! I'll never forget the server recommending their Royal Red Robin burger. She said I needed to try it and listed all the ingredients. But the one ingredient that caught my attention was the fried egg on top. ""Say whaaa? A fried egg on a burger? I'll pass!"" I said. ""Try it. If you don't like it I will take it back and you can have whatever you want on the house."" She confidently proclaimed. Well, with odds like that who wouldn't accept the challenge. The moment came when the burger arrived and the manager delivers the burger herself. All eyes on me as I took my first bite with a twisted 'I don't want to eat this' look on my face (I can be very expressive). ""Well?"" She asked ""Gimme a minute, gimme a minute"" I said as I tried to savor the new flavor combo going on in my mouth. ""I hate to tell you this since you were so confident I would like it... but I don't!""  That look of defeat came over their faces and I couldn't tease them anymore... ""I LOVED it"" I joyfully exclaimed, causing her to do a pelvic thrust of victory! LOL Over the next 6 months we were loyal customers, but what started off as a beautiful relationship began to go sour. The food just started to taste different and not in a good way. We stopped coming and Red Robin fell off our radar.  MY MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE Fast forward about 6 years and we find ourselves in the area after a wrestling match @ Brookwood High School, so we decided to give them another try. It was a Saturday afternoon and the dining room was half full. The other half was full of tables that had yet to be cleaned and it stayed that way for the first half of our visit. The floors had visible debris and I was totally amazed at how the girl sweeping missed most of it as she swept. Seriously? You don't see that? I thought to myself.  Our silverware comes and it too was dirty with dried on gook and I was honestly ready to leave. But, we stayed since we weren't going to be using the silverware anyway. I just wasn't in the mood for a burger so I decided to order the Crispy Chicken sandwich. All the while I sat there I was annoyed with the conditions of the store, but slowly they started to get it together (I think they were in the middle of a shift change). By the time our food arrived most of the tables were clean, but the floor could still use some help.  FOOD/SERVICE I'm telling you, the crispy chicken sandwich was so good it completely turned my mood around. It hit the spot so perfectly I made a second trip for lunch two weeks later. The sandwich was just as amazing, but what I want to share is the story of service on that 2nd visit. I was greeted with a warm smile from the hostess as she opened the front doors for me. I was then directed to the bar for my take out order where a server and the bartender both took my order. While I was waiting, Don (the manager) greeted me and he, the bartender and I began chatting about food. I talked about how my go-to dish used to be their shrimp platter, which prompted him to ask if I'd ever tried the clams. I told him I love clams but they literally hurt my jaws to eat. He goes off to answer a phone call and the bartender and I continue our conversation. A few moments later he brings out an order of clams just for me. He insisted I try them and boy was I happy I did. They were DE-LI-CIOUS and very tender.  The waitress returns with my lunch and included a Coke in a to-go cup. She then cozies up with the rest of us as we talked. As I prepare to leave, she gives me a gentle rub across my back and warmly tells me to come back while the bartender and manager are Googling directions to a restaurant they recommend I try in Watkinsville. They were so unusually friendly I started to wonder if I was on some sort of hidden TV show. They practically walked me to my car and I gotta say I found myself thinking about how well they treated me for the rest of my day. THE VERDICT I have no idea what I did to deserve such kindness, but thank you! I am reinstating myself as a fan and placing Red Robin back in my rotation of favorite places to eat! Oh, and FYI - the restaurant was spotless on my 2nd most recent visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.6719999999999997,3.2400000000000007

92,Blake B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,1,,1.0,2015-02-23,"Visited Red Robin tonight 2/23 with my Mom. We were immediately disgusted when we walked in the door as the hostesses were eating at the front table (where customers could have been sat) with a less than appetizing view. Food was sprawled over the entire table and spilling onto the floor. We tried to overlook the initial disgusting state of the restaurant and followed the hostess to the back of the restaurant where she attempted to sit us at a table that obviously had not been looked under. The floor under the table was entirely soaked (like a drink or two were spilt and not cleaned up). There were also food droppings all under the table. We asked to be sat at 2 tables over (the only clean table we could spot). Keep in mind for later that this table was in direct view of the kitchen. Though we were taken back and surprised (because we have been customers of this restaurant since it opened) our server was VERY polite. She addressed us almost immediately after we sat down and seemed MUCH cleaner than the restaurant itself...she almost seemed out of place (sad).  After placing our order, we had some time to sit and talk. While waiting, we could see into the kitchen (like I said before). I took a double take when one of the food preparation employees turned around (WITH A FULL PLATE OF FOOD IN HER HANDS) and sneezed-seemingly onto the food in her hands. Whether or not she tried to miss the food I am unsure. I was in denial...there was no way she just sneezed on a plate of food coming out of the kitchen. As I continued to watch, the same employee continued to wipe her nose all over her shirt (like a child).  At this point we had enough. We asked to pay for our drinks and for our food order to be cancelled. We also asked to speak to the manager. She came over and let us know she would take care of our food order. No real apology was delivered from the front of the house manager. The kitchen manager then came out to apologize. We explained that the kitchen was not the only reason we were disgusted but it was definitely the final straw. She made us aware that she would address the issue with this specific employee. She also wanted to make sure this would not be our last visit (sadly it probably will be).  As we were walking out the front door (and past the kitchen) we heard a fake ""ahh-choo"" coming from the kitchen. As if we had not already had enough reason to leave.

I do not want to throw the racist card here but trust me I think this place is like that. I only found this out later after reading another review. I am Asian by the way. We ordered a gourmet burger and they substituted the bun without asking us and brought the burger out. When we asked about the bun, they told us it was over. I am surprised that the waitress did not feel the need to come and inform us about the bun and ask us whether we wanted to change the order or not before the order came. We did not want to change the order after the burger came and wait all the remaining of us had burgers. When we called the manager, he only offered to give us $1 off a $60 bill ! They should have taken the whole burger off or at least a drink for their mistake but then again I think it may be because of our race. I do not want to call out the name of the manager but I thought he was really unprofessional.

After that, we had the person who was suppose to be our server take our food order.  The food didn't take that long to come out. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with a side of 'Freckled Fruit"". The chicken sandwich was very good, but the fruit was weird. It was fruit in some kind of fruit juice or syrup, and the strawberries looked like the ones you would use to make a processed smoothie drink, like they'd been soaking in the same jar as the maraschino cherries. But the apples were fresh, and I think it also had canned pineapple chunks in it. Nonetheless, I didn't eat it, it was unappetizing.  It took forever to get our bill. We had to finally ask the hostess to get it for us.

Surprisingly, the waiting area was full, yet there were several tables open but in need of cleaning. They were either short of staff, or they were moving at a snail's pace. We opted to sit in the bar area rather than to wait to sit in the dining area. We entered the area to find that it was not clean. There were dishes and food on and behind the bar. In fact, we had to wait for someone to come wipe out our seats before we could sit down. Once we sat, I discovered that the floor was sticky. All of this distracted from the experience. I'm not sure exactly how long it took for us to receive the food, but it was not worth the wait. For the price, we were definitely expecting better. Due to the wait, we didn't even bother to order more fries. The aspect of the visit that bothered me the most was how the bartenders ""cleaned"" the blender pitchers. Apparently, after a blender is used, its pitcher is placed in the sink under running water, which is allowed to run continuously. After another pitcher is used and in need of ""cleaning,"" the ""clean"" pitcher in the sink is dumped of its water and replaced with the dirty pitcher, water still running continuously. We sat at the bar for at least an hour and 15 minutes and never once was the water turned off. Due to their wastefulness, uncleanness & mediocre food, I will not be visiting this location again any time soon.

122,Dan D.,"Brooks, GA",48,266,94.0,2.0,2015-11-24,"So this is the first time I have been to this red robin since I started doing Yelp Reviews.  For some reason, the older folks in my family love this place but every time they go, they complain A LOT.  So I usually skip the family outing.  I ask them why they continue to go back... Its like supporting a bad habit.  Anyway... They wanted to go tonight and I have been out of town a lot lately and haven't seen them too much so I decided to go with them.  We went as a party of 5.  I was pleasantly surprised at the remodel that was done at this location.  At first glance it looked clean, smelled fresh and new.  It is very dark though.  Actually hard to see your menus and food.  We asked them to turn up the lights but it was never done.  The new dining room is very crowded.  The chairs actually but up against chairs from other tables.  Once you are seated don't plan on getting up to go anywhere.  My grandmother went to the restroom and came out complaining.  She said they were out of toilet paper, the counters were sloppy with water and soap all over it.   Our server initially seemed attentive. She came to see us right away and took our drink orders. When she arrived back, 2 of the 5 drinks were wrong.  She had to pass the drinks around the table because she couldn't walk in between the tables due to a tight squeeze.  For appetizers, MIL ordered onion rings and I ordered French onion soup cooked well done.. cheese dark on top.  A few minutes later the onion rings showed up and they were perfect. No problems.  About 10 minutes later my soup rolled out.. it was not cooked well at all and the cheese on top was not cooked enough.  No spoon either ... hard to eat soup with a fork.  When she finally came back with a spoon our meal was coming out.  So my appetizer was the same time my meal. UGH Frustrating.  We had an assortment of burgers between 3 people. None of which had any complaints about the burgers and said they tasted good.   My grandfather ordered clam chowder as his meal... It did not come out with the rest of our meal.  It took an additional 10 minutes to get his Chowder and the reason was .. NO BOWLS !   There were only 3 tables occupied in the restaurant and no bowls.   The waitress said they had a busy lunch so they needed to wash bowls.  This is now 5:30 in the afternoon and they haven't done dishes since lunch.  Gramps did say that the chowder was good once he got it.  I ordered ""Clucks"" with broccoli. ( chicken fingers ) The chicken fingers were WAY over-cooked.  They were very crispy and seemed like there was more breading than chicken.  The broccoli was cooked well and tasted fine.  At this point I was so frustrated with everything else that was going on so I just kept the clucks and took them home to the dogs.  All in all .. it took us an hour and a half to eat at a Red Robin ???? Not a good experience.  Not once did a manager offer to make anything right.  I will remind my family once again why we should not visit this place again ....  Buyer beware .....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,1.9920000000000002,2.76

71,Joyce M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,2,,1.0,2016-03-06,"Went to Red Robin on Saturday, March 5, 2016.  Asked to sit in the bar to avoid waiting; big mistake.  One waitress came to the table, introduced herself as our waitress.  Ordered root beer and water with lemon slices.  Got the root beer and water only.  Waited another 10 minutes before a different waitress came.  We did not realize that she was also the bartender.  Placed our order including lemon slices for the water.  Approximately 20 minutes later the food arrived and still no lemon slices.  The waitress/bartender was busy slinging drinks at the bar.  She threw a plastic container to her left; it ended up on the floor if the restaurant.  The problem, this item was being used to mix drinks (it appeared that it was a strawberry mixture that was included drinks for the customers.  The plastic container removed on the floor air at least 30 minutes with staff stepping over and around it.  Ordered the Avo-cobb-o salad.  The salad was good, appeared fresh and the Italian dressing on the side was tasty.  Within one hour of returning home, I was seriously ill!  Stomach cramps, sour taste and the dreadful case of diarrhea.  What a wonderful way to spend a Saturday.  BTW, we even had to wait for our bill.  Red Robin, the most disappointing experience in years.  I think I will skip visiting your restaurant until you take customer service seriously and improve on the customer experience.  This visit is a D minus!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=100,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.8280000000000003,2.24

However, lately we've stopped coming altogether because the service is SO bad and our order ALWAYS comes out wrong (literally every single time). Every time I order some pink and every time they bring it out cooked with no pink and my side always comes out wrong. The service is SOOOOO slow it ruins everything for me! I worked at Red Robin for over 7 years and find it intolerable to endure such poor service. They're supposed to greet you in 30 seconds which I find laughable. Last time not a single person came to our table in 7 minutes then I had to get up and hunt someone down. I set a timer now because it happens so often and the servers AND MANAGERS basically roll their eyes like I'm lying about how long I've waited. First bite check back? Yeah right. Never happens. Napkins or silverware? Only if you ask and even then most of the time I have to get up and get my own . Drink refills? You might get ONE your entire visit if you're lucky enough to have your server come back by your table before your plate is empty and you're ready to leave. The management is so unconcerned with the sucky service and that bums me out so much. It is clear even THEY don't see the failing service all around them. When management can't even recognize a table is VISIBLY unhappy, there's a serious problem at the root of the restaurant. This really sucks because Red Robin is my favorite restaurant but between the horrendous service, unconcerned management, servers that just don't care and cooks that can't read a ticket, I'll spend my money elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=80,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.9920000000000002,2.24

Took forever for someone to ask if we had given a drink order. I ordered the garden burger. What I got was a slimy half cooked something which was somewhat disgusting. The menu did not describe this as a vegetarian patty, which I think is what I got. I have had excellent veggie burgers and would have been ok with it but this did not even resemble that. The waitress asked what side we wanted. I asked what sides come with it.  She listed several choices but never said the sides were not included with the entree. No one offered to refill my water. That said, the patty melt was good as well as the kids chicken. Very expensive for what we had. That was my one and only visit to Red Robin. So disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20,1.92,2.42,2.42,,2.2199999999999998
29,Tammy C.,"Snellville, GA",5,20,,4.0,2017-06-11,"My family went here last week for dinner. We were seated quickly and received our menus. The waitress didn't come to our table for 10 mins. By this time we already knew our orders and did just that. After ordering our drinks were brought out in a timely manner. The waitress was average friendly. We all had different burgers and the good was tasty. The waitress immediately knew I had the wrong side dish and explained this before she set my food on the table, as well as brought me out the correct side also in a very timely manner. Our drinks we refilled as normal and we all got french fry refills.  We realized they had the ""call waitress "" button at the table and used it, she can quickly.  Aside from our intial wait, everything was good and done well.  Would come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville,2.0,2.43,2.43,,2.2580000000000005

34,Candy C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",14,30,75.0,1.0,2017-06-30,"THE WORST burger restaurant ever, in fact it is one of the worst American style restaurant I had ever eaten at. I ordered 2 grilled Mexican style chicken with garlic herb fries and my family ordered hamburgers with regular fries. the chicken was so chewy and super salty like it had been in marinate for very long time and frozen years ago. I know this because the texture of the chicken had changed, it was super disgusting. the garlic herb fries were drenched in flood of oil and tasteless, same with the burgers. I also ordered smoothie, it was nasty like they just put the whole bag of sugar in it. I only drank couple sips. The service was super slow, it took forever for her to come by to ask for our drinks and to deliver our drink so forget about asking for more bottomless fries because you will be sitting there for 3 or 4 hours. whenever I heard their theme song Red Robin yum, it should be Red Robin YUCK!!. There are so many restaurants that did not survive the economy like Ruby Tuesday, Red lobster etc and this one will be on the same fate because they are not willing to improve but keep providing disgusting food and horrible customer service. It starts with management! if you are the owner of this restaurant, you need to fire the management and start new or you probably had already thinking about closing this business. Red Robin does not even deserve 1 star! I had to put one because I must submit this review. Customers need to stay away from this awful restaurant, believe me the reviews are correct. If you see mixed reviews, the good ones are probably fake. I am a regular Yelp reviewers, I don't give bad reviews unless it is very necessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville,2.04,2.43,2.43,,2.2740000000000005
28,Michelle T.,"Smyrna, GA",149,59,69.0,3.0,2017-07-03,So I used my birthday coupon and you get a free burger entree. I sat at the bar and everyone from the hostess to the bartender were friendly. The only reason why I didn't give four stars is no one informed me that they were out of steak fries until the server brought my meal and I saw crinkles fries. I asked why no steak fries and he said has been out for three days. I wish I would have known that but good thing is the bartender didn't charge me for upgrading to Parmesan fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville,2.0,2.44,2.44,,2.2640000000000002

84,Kavin A.,"Grayson, GA",0,1,,1.0,2017-07-19,Disappointed in the customer service I received. My family and I visited this store several time. My youngest son who is 7 years old ask to go on his birthday so they could sing happy birthday to him. After he heard them sing it to some one on a previous visit.  I let the server know as soon as we placed our order. After we finished our meal and waited awhile for the to bring his birthday sundae the server told me they were to busy and couldn't make the time to do it. It only take 10 second to sing a birthday song. And mind you it was a Wednesday night I been there on Saturdays and they witness them sing the song to several parties. After I voiced my displeasure I was told they found try and get some people together. I declined and left the store because as a customer I don't think any one would have mind waiting 10 second extra while a few waitress sang a birthday song to a 7 year old child. And if you were to busy they what changed?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=40,2.0,2.43,2.43,,2.2580000000000005

104,Andy V.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,43,10.0,3.0,2017-07-29,"Have not been to red robin in many years but wanted to revisit tonight. Almost did not go because of many reviews talking about bad wait times for tables, food, and drink. Also negatives on the wait staff. But i went anyway, at about 6pm sat night. It was just starting to get pretty crowded. It only took 5 minutes for a table for 2. We were helped right away by a busy but friendly waitress. It took about 5 minutes for drinks and less than 15 mins for our food. I saw negative reviews on bottomless fries but we got plenty and waitress stopped to see  if we needed more several times. Service was great! My problem was that the burgers just werent that tasty, just kinda bland. I got the sur acha and the mac and cheese burgers, buns didnt seem very fresh and not the flavor i would have expected from menu description.  Overall, still a reasonable burger bar. Finally - please clean the bathrooms, very messy!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20,2.0,2.42,2.42,,2.252

106,Brandy S.,"Watkinsville, GA",0,4,,1.0,2017-09-17,"Going here for the first time was like watching an episode of Bar Rescue. If you want first hand experience what a restaurant is like when it is being poorly managed and has staff that hate their job,then go here. You will often run into a restaurant that has poor waiters but this place took it to a whole other level. All the wait staff walking around like they don't know who has what table and groups of guests being left outside unattended. There is one bartender trying to make drinks for the entire restaurant, get togo orders ready and help give direction to the wait staff. She did an excellent job with what is being given to her. She often had to go get things from the kitchen and bring it to tables because the waitresses are nowhere to be found. The bad communication between all the staff is just a complete joke. The manager was also just walking around watching things but doing nothing. I would be incredibly concerned if I owed this restaurant. The food was just okay and might be better on a day that is very, very slow. We sat at the bar and she apologized a few times for the things we were witnessing. When we got up to leave, a different lady was behind the bar finally trying to help the bartender and I smiled at her and she just looked at me with a nasty look. I am glad we sat at the bar, otherwise I am sure we wouldn't have made it to get our food. Hopefully the owner will come and witness this catastrophe before it's too late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville?start=20,1.96,2.37,2.37,,2.2060000000000004
31,Meghan P.,"Cumming, GA",62,6,,1.0,2017-09-17,Service was absolutely horrible at this location. We walked in and the women who appeared to be the manager was just yelling to get us a table and had a bad attitude. Then we waited for nearly 15 minutes for our waitress to come to our table..mind you they were not busy. It took another 15 for out drinks to get there. Food came out after another long wait and we asked for sauces and our waitress said okay then proceeded to walk away and sit down to count her tips and talk with the hostess instead of getting the sauce. By the time she came back (with no sauce) we had to ask for more fries because ours had gotten cold...all around just bad customer service. The location I nearly go to has never had bad service or given me anything less than great service.

20,Local_Guy ..,"Dacula, GA",1,31,,4.0,2017-11-17,"Red Robin yummmmmmm!!! Try getting that tune out of your head. A burger joint at its core, Red Robins delivers the goods. I have only come to this location on weekdays during lunch, so I cant attest to wait times as there really hasn't been any when I come.  The decor is clean inside. Your greeted by the Lady Liberty holding up a burger instead of a torch. You would think with the name of the place they would have a cartoon bird holding up the burger, but hey, lets get some American spirit in here and display the statue of liberty advertising sodium and cholesterol. Some odd pictures on the walls that I am guessing were bought on eBay or an antique shop. Gotta dig the beer bottle chandelier in the bar area though. Burgers are really good. Its not the meat so to speak, but the seasoning they use ( you can buy this stuff by the way ). The prices are kind of all over the place, but if you order the Tavern Burgers, its $6.99 for a really good burger and unlimited fries ( fries are good as well ). They do have some unusual burgers such as a Taco Burger...guess the chef was high one day and wanted a burger and Mexican, but had to use what he had in the immediate area so threw chips and guacamole on a burger.  The place is frequented by elderly people whenever my wife and I come. I guess the early bird special here rocks. Staff seems friendly and you get your food quickly ( again this is when I come ). It gets the bada-bing thumbs up from the Local Guy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lawrenceville,1.92,2.36,2.36,,2.184

22,Geoff H.,"Braselton, GA",0,2,,2.0,2018-01-13,Very disappointed. The hostess staff seem to think it appropriate to ignore the customers in favor of staring at the iPad used for seating charts. When they do finally decide to notice you they will walk away in the middle of your sentence to look for a table that apparently does show up on the all knowing iPad.  My burger was good and as expected on the other hand there were very few fries. My daughter had the pub mac and cheese. Size was not what was expected for the price.  My wife ordered the $7.00  chips and salsa. She referred to it as tomato juice and onions. Came in a very small contained more like a condiment size. The service was fair and we had no problem with the waiter.
