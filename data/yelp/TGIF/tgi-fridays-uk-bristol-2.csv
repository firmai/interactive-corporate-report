Jan S.,"San Diego, CA",88,23,2,4.0,4/21/2014,Great place if your missing America. Make sure to order angus beef. Sooo much better. Cocktails should be made stiffer considering the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-bristol-2
Eleanor S.,"Bristol, United Kingdom",10,310,307,3.0,5/6/2010,"YEE-HAH!! If you want rootin-tootin good food then get on down to TGI Fridays. Your stomach will thank you for it! Heart-warming, wholesome and filling food all-round.  The staff are rushed off their feet due to the popularity of their restaurant, but are always so happy and jolly that you could mistake this for drug-induced highs! They have burgers, ribs, steak, and other meaty goodness which is perfect for large groups and teenagers (the usual eaters at this place). You can't come here and be grumpy...the staff won't let you. Smiling will come naturally after a visit here though :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-bristol-2
Rob N.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",6,33,4,3.0,9/2/2012,"I think I was unlucky and lumbered with the amateur waiter.  The place was quite cramped too, and not as spacious as some of the other TGI's I've visited. The bar is good though.  Actually, every TGI's bar is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-bristol-2
Neil J.,"Slape Cross, United Kingdom",0,2,,2.0,2/27/2011,"Pretty standard american bar/grill type deal apart from two things the great cocktails and the horrific prices. Fun but really not worth the price for fairly average food, they dress it up quite well but it is still steak/burger and chips you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-bristol-2
