Andy G.,"Batavia, IL",19,169,40,4.0,10/4/2017,"I have upped my rating of CPK because I like their rotating specials. Awhile ago they had a Korean pizza which was particularly good. I especially like how the toppings and/or ingredients creatively adhere to whichever theme is being portrayed. One downside is that if you really do like a special it will eventually be replaced by a new one. However, the new special is usually just as good keeping the dining experience fresh. Right now an ancho chili short rib panini or chicken meatball panini is featured. This is one of the best specials I have ever had and I will be sorry to see it go (sad face). The lunch duos are a good deal. This is a choice of a small salad and a small pizza available for a little over ten dollars. The chain feeling is still strong for me, but these specials make a difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva
Rachel W.,"Elgin, IL",112,180,52,4.0,6/30/2017,"Typical CPK food. It's good for a chain. I've always enjoyed it but now I try not to go to chain restaurants as much.

Felice C.,"Morton Grove, IL",363,157,499,3.0,6/11/2015,"For some reason, I never realized how overpriced CPK was before dining at this location. I ordered the California Club and my friend had the Original BBQ Chicken. Service was pleasant, but we were so hungry and the bread seemed as if it were taking forever. We also wanted an appetizer...but sweet Jesus why are the appetizers priced like entrees?!

The hostess was smiling and very friendly. Our server Austin was awesome!!! Extremely friendly and knowledgeable, help us navigate the menu with recommendations. We had a Caesar salad, Margherita pizza and the warm butter cake for desert. Everything was delivered quickly by Zach who was friendly and wanted to know if there was anything else he could do for us. The manager stopped by to see if everything was OK and stayed for a few minutes discussing the restaurant and food quality.  Nice to have outstand people delivering outstand customer service.

Todd L.,"Elgin, IL",26,70,44,3.0,12/31/2016,As I enter I notice the seating is set up more like a breakfast joint. The low dividers means lots of noise. They would be better if they would have installed some frosted glass on top of the dividers not only to muffle the loud noise but for some privacy as well. Now for the pizza. We had their garlic chicken pizza. NOT GOOD. The crust is like a gyro pita and the used garlic powder which was just a bad idea. The wine was good and the service was good. If I went back I would have to try something other then pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva

Elizabeth J.,"Geneva, IL",1,28,3,3.0,11/5/2013,Heard that CPK added a gluten free pizza to their menu so had to try it...when I told them I was gluten free they had the chef come out and greet me and asked that I let them know what I thought of the pizza. Unfortunately it was quite gooey. They said that is because they can't put the pizza directly in the oven but instead need to put it on a pan to avoid any contamination.  The service here was great but unfortunately won't be back for the pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva?start=40

I had a hankering for a good salad with some chicken, and that is what I ended up with.  Mom raved about her adobe soup, and my salad was exactly what I wanted....cut small, with lots of flavor, and lots of thin slices of grilled chicken.  More so than the food, the service was notable.

Now, I am disappointed with the statement on the menu where it says we now offer Gluten Free Piazza's, I will never feel comfortable ordering an item that says it is gluten free when it is prepared in the same area with gluten items. I went here because I had just 3 hours at T-Mobile stuff and my Blood Sugar was low. I had a coupon for a Free Quinoa & Argula Salad which only comes with 1/2 ounce of protein, I order chicken on it and just charged $4 for 4 oz of chicken which I think is way overpriced and then they were going to charge me extra subbing the feta cheese with mozzaella, just wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva?start=40

Olya K.,"Batavia, IL",2,21,,3.0,8/27/2007,"I have shunned California Pizza Kitchen for a while, avoiding it as a typical chain establishment that I try to stay away from in general. I was pleasantly surprised however, finding what I did when I came here for lunch. I split a pizza and a salad with a friend for lunch. Did not have enough time to finish going thru all the choices on the pizza menu, and was disappointed with the crust - should have gone with the Neapolitan pizza given my general preference for thin crust. So pizza was mediocre, although toppings were decent and I would probably be back to try other choices. Mediterranean Salad, however, was yummy - all the right conminations of flavors, including roasted peppers, and a base of hummus on the bottom which really worked well in this salad. I split it with a friend, and we got a half size, which was more than enough (if you are getting a pizza too). Good lunch atmosphere all in well. I would still choose Panera over this though, much cheaper too... I add from a second visit for a dinner at a Schaumburg location: my net/net positive opinion does not change after visiting another location. I had soup and hald a salad this time with a glass of wine. Still good, and I am still liking this, although starting to wonder if they charge too much for the type of place they are. I think they are trying to swipe those meat/ shrimp additions to salads, particularly the half salads that become the price of the full salad by the time you throw the add-on in. Not to be cheap here, but this mutes the appeal of this place a little (based on what the type of place vs. the price).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva?start=40

P S.,"Columbus, OH",269,533,64,3.0,1/9/2013,"I was in the burbs, ok? Don't you judge me. My sister wanted a salad and their version of a taco pizza. Try as I did, I couldn't pull the steering wheel away from her so in we went.  I ordered the half Cobb salad and I gotta say, it was pretty darn good. Liberal with the ingredients (including beets! Mmmm dirt cherries) and not a shred of iceberg lettuce was seen. The piece of my sister's taco pizza that I had was...interesting. Beans instead of red sauce, chips and lettuce, some cheese and tomatoes, etc. It was ok. I'm a pizza and taco purist so I would never order that, but I was very content with my salad and a half is good for a meal with no leftovers, especially if you nom on the bread they bring.

Kerry B.,"Plainfield, IL",51,34,7,4.0,7/28/2013,"What an experience!!!   We were seated immediately by the friendly male host and within seconds our server came to greet us.  My friend and I eat dinner out a lot and have experienced some not so good wait staff.  Our server, Gabby, on the other hand was such a delight!  She was polite, she was patient with our order, answered our silly questions, she was very attentive (but not hovering) in case we needed a refill or extra napkins, she inquired with the bartender about a special drink that my friend wanted that wasn't on the menu and the best part....she actually smiled!  That's rare these days.  She genuinely seemed to enjoy her job.  If I were basing this review just on Gabby, I would definitely give her five stars. But, we also ate.  We ordered the Thai Spring Rolls as an appetizer.  While we were waiting for them Gabby brought us out bread and oil.  We were starving so we scarfed that right down.  Pretty good!  When the spring rolls came out, a few of them had been singed in the oven.  Disappointing but not a big deal.  The peanut sauce that came with the rolls tasted like melted down peanut butter.  It wasn't the best sauce I've eaten, it needs some more spice.  Otherwise, the spring rolls were tasty and fulfilled a slight thai craving I was having. We ordered the Veggie Pizza with no mushrooms, added the goat cheese and with Gabby's suggestion, went with the whole wheat crust.  It was pretty decent.  I loved the addition of the goat cheese, gave it a nice tart little kick.  The only thing I would change about the pizza would be to put just a few more toppings on.  I think there was one piece of eggplant on the entire pizza. Overall this was a 5 star experience, soley based on the excellent service and attention of Gabby, but had to drop off a star for the food, I mean, it's a chain restaurant, not a 5 star gourmet establishment.  Also because when we asked to speak to a manager to compliment Gabby on her job well done, all he did was try to push their survey on us, basically begging us to call into the number and give them all a good review.  It was kind of awkward and we left not knowing if the manager was even going to let Gabby know how great she was. 4 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-geneva?start=20
Samantha M.,"Carpentersville, IL",2,17,18,4.0,7/18/2013,"My boyfriend and I just went here the other night for dinner. We got a hummus appetizer which was delicious. I got a shrimp fettuccine dish which was also delicious and my boyfriend got some sort of Hawaiian pizza. He said the pizza was very good. The only thing that was a little bothersome about it is I felt the wine was a bit overpriced. Of course, because it's alcohol, there's not prices on the menu but I ordered two glasses of wine and they ended up being $10 a piece. I thought for the rest of CPK's prices, that was a bit much. However, that being said, the wine was very good. I may have still ordered two glasses... just would've liked to not have been so blind sided by the price. My boyfriend got a beer, a pretty large blue moon, and that was only $6, so I guess there's balance. Our waiter was excellent, and all said and done our bill was about $65 for two people. A little bit much, I thought, for a place that is supposed to be pretty casual.
