17,Jinra I.,"Anaheim, CA",217,281,1.0,3.0,2012-01-04,"When I'm in in the city of Orange in my native California, TGI Friday's is rarely an option. Sadly out here in Orange, Connecticut, it is one of few options. Luckily, all the reasons why it's rarely an option in Orange, California hardly keep me from coming to this particular TGI Friday's in Orange, Connecticut. Food is great, especially for those on a budget. I usually like anything on the menu that has Jack Daniel's (that you can eat not drink) and appetizers. I've never really seen this location packed to capacity which is unlike the TGI Fridays in California -- it can get a little obnoxious there. As for service, it's okay. At the same time, I suspect that there's some card skimming fraud happening here. Be sure to bring cash when you come to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20,1.868,1.868,1.868,1.868,1.8680000000000003

Came in and was a little creeped out at the fact that there were 3-4 hosts standing there with menus all in hand for our party. I said 'for 6 please' and the response I get was 'we know, please follow us this way'. Persistence? Determined? Go-Getter? We sit down and was informed that our server was going to be right with us. 'Joe' comes to us and asks if we wanted anything else to drink besides water and proceeds with asking if we were ready to order. I'm sorry, would you like for us  to just leave as you're literally pushing us out? We say, one moment.. Joe comes back in a bit to get our order as he's delivering our waters. He tried holding 6 cups all at once by hugging it in his body...something isn't right. So, the cup I'm about to drink was held up against your shirt? Where there could be an array of things on there? Divine... We had order 3 steaks, 2 chickens, and one ribs order. 2 out of the 3 steaks were cooked so dry even though we stated medium RARE. We didn't ask for them to remake it since we knew other things could go wrong. The 2 dried steaks weren't even completely finish, not even half finished. 1 chicken was burnt and the other was considered 'blackened chicken'. The ONLY good part of that lunch was the kids ribs we ordered. Being that this is a National chain, don't expect the food to be the same. Could be the state, the cooks, the service, but always go in as if you've never gone before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

We walked into the bar & all booths were taken. I went back to the host & asked if we can wait for a table at the booth to open up. She said sure, her name was Nicole. She suggested that instead of waiting, that we would grab drinks at the bar & when a table is open we can grab it. 10 o'clock hits, no table was open - which was fine because we were having drinks. 10:15p a table was being cleaned. The host walks into the bar to see if a table was open, just in time I asked her if we can finally sit there. Her response was ""there are people waiting for that table"" I told her ""even though I have been waiting for 45 mins?"" but she ignored me & sat 4 people that just walked in the restaurant 15 mins ago.

(1/2 appetizers make it easy to do so.) They had some other seemingly awesome happy hour specials, which would be worth checking out-  The wings were really just chicken tenders rolled in buffalo sauce- they werent the best, nor were they the worst. They were just okay. There dessert menu is pretty good too- we went with the brownie explosion- warm brownie topped with vanilla bean ice cream peacan nuts and fudge.  Biggest complaint about this place....the service was so....slow....... We were there for close to an hour, and all we got was one appetizer, and one dessert.

I went to the bar since I was by myself sat down and the bartender asked me what I would like to drink. I replied I had to go into work this evening so a Coke or Pepsi would be fine. She then asked for my ID (which caught me off guard) I replied for a coke? She stated since I was sitting at the bar I had to prove that I was 21, which I found unusual but I complied (I'm 27) and showed her my ID. She brought me a coke and I asked for a menu, I sat there for just a few minutes looking over the menu. I decided on a California club, so I laid down the menu on the counter and began my wait. I sat there and waited close to 15 minutes as two bartenders walked back and forth poring drinks and following up with the food orders for the others around me. I began to become frustrated as I keep a close eye on my watch, as I saw the other bartender walk past me again I waved and asked for my check. He brought the check over and asked if everything was alright since I had only ordered a coke. I replied no, I would just like my check, and to get out of here. He replied would you like food or something; you seem very frustrated, I calmly said yes I did want food but I will be going elsewhere now. He asked what the problem was and began to raise his voice, I again replied ""I would just like my check so I can leave"" since he raised his voice I could see the other patrons beginning to draw their attention to the situation. I paid cash for my $3.07 soda left $0.50 on the counter and walked out. I have been traveling for close to 10 years and I have only walked out of one other restaurant in my life.

It had been previously frozen and you could tell for a loooooong time. It was so bland and had a weird color to it. The fresh broccoli was far from fresh as well. Fries over salted.

The deal is you can personally order only one appetizer and get free refills on that as many times as you want. But I wouldn't want to be sitting there eating mozzarella sticks all day, would you? So get a few friends and share your dishes. It'll make a meal. The highlights included buffalo wings. We ordered the four different flavors, Tennessee BBQ, Garlic Parmesan, Buffalo or Scorching Hot. After a couple rounds, the varying temperatures of the wings didn't make us like them more. I think Garlic Parm was the best of the four and Scorching Hot was a close second. The other notable dish was the Pan-Seared Pot Stickers (aka dumplings). They were pretty good, but definitely seemed like they were just taken out of the freezer. The consistency wasn't present. The other dishes we got were: Tuscan Spinach Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, and Loaded Potato Skins. Just okay in taste, nothing special. Most of us got our money's worth but small groups or individuals probably won't because I wouldn't suggest eating so much of the same dish.

32,Jessica T.,"Fairfield, CT",18,65,184.0,2.0,2015-11-21,"When I was younger, coming to TGIF was a treat. But I feel like they fell off, especially with some of the food.  I usually just order apps and/or a salad, although I remember the burgers were always really good. The last time I went, the presentation of the food was lackluster. Felt it was simply thrown together and that for me is off putting since I love to take and post pictures of the food! One of the apps we ordered were the potato skins, which looked very nonuniform. Some of the skins were covered in bacon while others had two or three pieces? The food was pretty average and the drinks are so-so for me. Recently they've been renovating, hopefully it comes out good! Maybe new additions to the menu too?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
36,Intellectual Reviews I.,"Bridgeport, CT",62,76,200.0,3.0,2016-02-07,"Came to TGI Fridays to eat and watch Super Bowl 50! I am part of their ""Stripes"" program where you earn coupons and free stuff by eating there. Tonight I used a buy one get one free entree coupon I got in my email. I double stacked my Jack Daniels burger, along with my guest's double stacked Sicilian burger. Both delicious. What I enjoy here is that they offer a gluten free bun for their burgers and other healthy gluten free meals. They do have their days where their meals come out a little longer than usual, but the prices and quality is always decent or better. Not a bad alternative place to go out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
16,Allison P.,"Trumbull, CT",0,4,,1.0,2016-06-13,"Went here and it was awful. The service was so slow, despite the fact that there was no one even there. It was happy hour during the week and they had maybe 5 other people eating. I went with my friend and sat down at the bar and it took 10min just for someone to acknowledge us! Then after they gave us the menus and asked if we were ready to order we said not yet. After another 5min they finally came over and took our drink order. It took two bartenders to make them and even with that  of course they messed them up. (by the way there was basically no alcohol even in them) We waited over 10min for them and they mixed up our drinks and put sugar on the rim of a diabetic who specifically asked for no sugar. After giving us our drinks they finally took our food order which took another 20min to even get to us. Nevertheless, after all that the food was disgusting. I ordered the bruchetta chicken pasta. Thinking it would be amazing after 20min of waiting it was basically a can of spaghetti o's with a disgusting tomato sauce. The worse part was the entire bar smelled like cleaning product!!!!!!!!WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
37,Bobby C.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,1.0,4.0,2016-08-24,"I tried TGI for the first time ever because I heard about there all you can eat special for $10. For the price, I think the food was really good. My sister and I spent $20 on food worth approximately $65 (I feel ashamed)... The staff was really nice as they frequently came around asking us for refills and if we would like another round. The only concern I have about that place is that the restaurant needs some moderate renovations as it looks a few years old. We also were seated next to a leaking air conditioner which was unappealing. Nonetheless, decent food, good price, good staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

( we only ordered sodas). The table was dirty and sticky and there were spiders running around. Service was just as bad, didn't clear our app plates and never came to check on us. Manager was walking around with his head up his ass. Won't be going there again.

0,Lily B.,"Stratford, CT",8,5,,1.0,2016-10-25,"I've been coming here with a friend for about 8 months or something primarily for the bar, and every single time I've gone this particular bartender has been so cynical and rude to me I've decided that I will not be returning. Today was my birthday, and I was just trying to have a good time, and everything i asked him was returned with some snide, sarcastic remark. I asked to see the drink menu and he said ""we ran out of those."" and he proceeded to ignore me for about 10-15 minutes. He was goofing around at one point and was throwing balled up pieces of napkin at customers and managed to throw one of them into my drink. The only time i remember enjoying my time there tonight was when the manager brought us our appetizer, he was polite. Don't get me wrong, I'm a bartender also, and i understand that being a fun person is a part of the job, but this guy is always nothing more than a rude a**hole, and I'm tired of going in and being afraid of being made fun of which he managed to do tonight.

The host at the door was great as usual, but our waiter/ bartender should stay behind the bar. It took to long to get our drinks, and even longer to get our food. A couple that came in after us ate before us. And when we got up to leave,the manager came with our food offering to give it to us for free. We took it home and my burger was black as night and didn't have anything that I asked for on it. We will never return there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

39,Marquis G.,"West Haven, CT",2,25,,1.0,2017-02-19,"I'll cut to the point, the food here was atrocious. I was with a party of seven and no one had anything great to say about the food. The sesame chicken (appetizer) was hard as a rock. Three steaks were ordered and they came out completely burnt. There's well done and then there's done, beyond repair. I asked my niece if she wanted my tools out of my trunk so she could saw through the charcoal. The two burgers that were ordered were completely dry and hard. They were basically mini frisbees. I ordered a medium burger and got well well done. The fish that was ordered was dry and seemed old. The chicken tenders were enjoyed by my four year old nephew, who was happy just to eat after waiting for so long. (We asked for his stuff to be sent out first). We told the manager about our frustrations and she apologized and gave a discount. She also mentioned that the chef was backed up and the place was short-staffed. We will not be back. What a waste of money!! This establishment got two stars overall by the general population ...for a reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

There was a family of four that had come in prior to my party of two that hadn't even been greeted by a server the whole time we were there. We waited at least 5 minutes to be greeted, another 6 minutes for drinks, and while waiting for her to come back to take our order (which was even longer) we decided to just leave. There was a total of 4 tables in the whole place with two servers and they couldn't even handle that. Pretty pathetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

Once we finally sat down and ordered it took 1 hour for the food to come out. Couldn't understand how people who sat after us got food way before in a timely fashion. Finally the waitress came out and apologized stating they were backed up which again was confusing because it seemed like everyone else was receiving their orders promptly. So the food finally came out and it was cold as if it was ready but had just not been served. The waitress then says the last part of my order wasn't ready as if an hour wasn't already enough time.
