Whitnee B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",239,2,,1.0,5/29/2017,Came to my favorite restaurant to enjoy a couples night and regrettably it was a horrible experience. Our food took close to 30 min for us to receive anything and when we did get something to eat it was my husbands refill not the actual meal he ordered. After waiting for a while and speaking to the manager our food arrived but my meal was totally wrong. I had to wait another 15 min to receive a replacement while my husband and friends ate their meal. I ended up taking it home. This is not the experience I wanted to have on a date night especially when I hardly get to spend time with my husband and friends due to work.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20
Renee W.,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,7,,1.0,4/22/2017,Ugh went there yesterday with my coworkers for lunch around 1pm. We sat by the booth near the bar and we had a male server..worse server I ever met. How do you try to take orders with an attitude. I was shocked. We had to request for a new server and then move to the side where our new server was(he was so much better)they really need to observe how their waiter/waitress are doing out in the dining room. Left a bad experience for  me.  Smh. Sad,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20
Jessica D.,"Stratford, NJ",74,147,133,1.0,10/8/2015,"So you mean to tell me a FRIDAY's can't handle a party of ten on a Sunday night? Being that it was happy hour all day Sunday our group kept it simple.  We all ordered appetizers and drinks off the happy hour menu.  From the beginning our waitress seemed frazzled.   Our order took 25 minutes to come out and by the time it came out our food was cold.  Also one of our friends order NEVER came out.  There was something wrong with every single order and when we let her know she always had an excuse and nothing was done to fix it.  We didn't make a big deal we just asked her to remove the items that never came out from our check.  Wouldn't you know when the check came out, all the items that were never brought out to us were still on there.    Horrible Service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20

Tim K.,"Culpeper, VA",34,16,,2.0,8/3/2017,"One of the worst TGIF I've been to as well.  We were seated quickly enough, but the seating itself is EXTREMELY crowded and tight.  Drinks came reasonably quick, as did the first round of all-you-can-eat apps.  Then the typical problem.  We literally went 15 minutes or more without seeing our server again.  Definitely a way for TGIF to save money on the endless apps - don't ever bring the server back to the table.  We ended up having to pay w/ the little table kiosk, because we literally NEVER saw our server again.  NEVER going to this TGIF again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20

My cheeseburger was available with a gluten free bun as well, which I really appreciate. It was cooked perfectly and had a nice char grilled flavor. Service was fairly prompt and friendly. I can't say too much about the decor. It seems one step above the BWW ""hose-it-off-when-you're-done"" interior, but I guess it was fairly comfortable. There wasn't anything here that would make me rush back, but it certainly offered a decent burger in a convenient location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20
Tasha F.,"New Brunswick, NJ",82,23,38,2.0,11/13/2016,We like to go to Fridays on Sundays because of the awesome happy hour they have all day. This was the first time I have been to this location and will probably be the last. We arrived as a party of 8 and there was no host to be found!! There was a crowd of people in the front trying to get sat. After about 10 minutes we went searching and I'm guessing the server we mentioned it to went to get the host who then returned. I asked for a manager but he/she never came over. Whatever. It wasn't the worst or best service I've ever received.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20
Shantel S.,"Newark, NJ",135,25,,2.0,7/30/2016,"I came to this location a few times and it was my favorite location. However, after today, I will NOT return.  I came for lunch for my organization's meeting and it was not crowded. A few of us came and we decided to order with our waiter, Les (I believe was his name). I ordered the Mahi Mahi Naan'Which with a Caesar salad along with water and lemon. After twenty two minutes, I had to ask for my drink.  A table of 4 sitting behind us came after we were there for 20 minutes and ordered. Food from our table came after 30 minutes (sizzling chicken and shrimp, drinks). My friend received her Mahi Mahi Naan'Which order in and after eating it, realized it was my order except she wanted spinach (as opposed to a salad). I was fine with it because I assumed her order would be next. More of my friends came and received their orders immediately, along with the table behind us so I inquired about my order. Les (with a condescending tone) said my food was out so I have to wait. I honestly wanted to curse him out but because of my meeting I decided not to (but I did privately with my friends). I finally received my food (which was almost 50 minutes).  Luckily, my sister paid for me because if it was up to me, I would not have left a tip for that jackass. Money is too tight for a server to be nasty. I dislike poor customer service. So I am done with this location and will email the corporate office as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20

Linda P.,"Westville, NJ",0,1,,5.0,1/8/2017,"Came here for lunch after a hockey tournament with my 13-year-old grandson.  Food and service was great....  Unfortunately, upon leaving my grandsons personalized hockey jacket got left behind!  We live 2 hours away!  We called the next day to see if it was found and happily it was and we were told by the manager that it was tucked away safely in the office. I mentioned we live two hours away and asked if there was someway they could send us the jacket and we would send them the money to ship it.  Kerry, the manager, was not only helpful but very sincere in his actions to get the jacket back to us as quickly as possible.

Chris E.,"Elizabeth, NJ",1,4,5,1.0,10/12/2016,I'm sitting at the table with my daughter having a discussion when this geto and I mean geto bartender begins having a conversation with another coworker cursing up a storm. Then the server comes along like he hates his life and asked us what we want to drink and comes back 20 minutes later because the bartender who was working was to busy running her fowl mouth about some record deal and continuing to curse even tho I looked at her. Then to top it off the manager walks by not to say tone it down but to ask the bartender how her lunch was. This place has gotten extremely worst over the years and now it's just geto fowl mouth people who work there.          Now the unhappy server who has walked passed my table at least a dozen times is completely ignoring me. So I would strongly recommend never going to this Friday's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=20

Usually when I come here I always have the luck of getting the same waiter who seems to think my boyfriend and I are his ""brother and sister"" I really dislike his unprofessionalism (is that even a word ). I had to write a review today because I am feed up  I sat here for over half an hour just waiting for someone to come and take my drink order. Then I sat here for another half and hour waiting for my app (tuscan spinach dip) the waitress finally came over after I grilled her and informed me all the dishes were dirty and she was waiting for them to be washed before they served me my app.... I am currently here writing this review still waiting for my food and I'm so ready to leave... If it wasn't because I'm hungry I would leave.

Got appetizers and ordered the potstickers which were sorta burnt and tasted sorta strange. I've had them before at other Friday's, but won't order them again if I come back to this location. My guest ordered the buffalo chicken wings and they tasted great. For the main course, I ordered  the sizzling chicken and shrimp and my guest ordered the sirloin steak and veggies.

Came in noticed it was happy hour, was only 3 of us so instead of getting a booth we opted for the bar area. As soon as we sat down it seemed the barmaid was annoyed that she had to wait on us. I got the happy hour Ultimate Margarita, a friend proceeded to get the Sangria & when she asked if it was included with happy hour the barmaid got an attitude ""No, do you still want it""? My friend didn't want to appear cheap so she said yeah. After ordering our drinks, the food took an additional 20-minutes for what IDK.... After sitting there for about a good 15 minutes into our meals/drinks she just left us and proceeded to pretend to clean the bar area and make drinks for someone else so another waitress had to attend to us. Just completely rude especially for a Sunday night, imagine if the place was packed & she actually had to work SMH Overall the place is decent especially the bar area with all of the TV's but you guys should train your employees to leave their attitudes & personal problems in the parking lot.

I give 4 stars on behalf of my family who is here telling me to give it 5.  It is close to my home and we can walk there.  It s right by a bowling alley which makes for a good family fun night.  And when I leave I look back at my happy and stuffed family and feel good about coming here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden?start=40

There was a party of two that sat behind us and they made homophobic comments. Once they saw us, they immediately asked for takeout. We were minding our own business and didn't deserve to be degraded in such a manor. Everyone else seemed to receive there food on time except us. We feel like it was set up and it was all apart of a hidden agenda. They had more than enough time to make our food. A different party arrived after us and the waitress told them that the kitchen was closing in 45 minutes.

But we got there around 4 on Saturday and was glad to see it was happy hour - on a weekend. We got huge draft beers for only $3 each.  Yup $3 each. All of their apps were half off so we chowed down - and they were pretty damn good.  The gals who worked there were great, quick and really friendly.

To start, I won't give any chains 5 stars, so we begin with 4.  Things this place it has against it: the service is spotty at times, it took a good 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Despite the fact that the menu says they have local craft beer, they did not. The menu is a little on the pricy side, everything about $2 more than the fair price. $6.50 is not the right price for a small Caesar salad- $4.50 would be a more reasonable price. The $14 chicken sandwich should be $12... you get the idea.  They also advertise through posters in the lobby to download the rewards app- which doesn't work at this location since they're not a corporate store. Very confusing. Minus 2 stars.  To their credit, they do have a slightly above average beer selection, the menu is a level above a typical chain restaurant, the restaurant is newly renovated, and once you can get the attention of a server, you do get pretty good service.

Malva C.,"Somerset, NJ",14,46,4,1.0,10/19/2017,"Agree with some of the reviews, food and especially service are below par. This is a chain restaurant, but that does not mean they should not have pride in how/what they serve and not have quality at the center of their operation. Came on a Wed night for a school fundraiser. They were not busy. Well, the table areas were not busy, the bar area was where all the action took place. Took 10 minutes for the hostess to come acknowledge myself and 2 other small parties like mine. After that, another 7-8 minutes for our server to come take out order. Asked what was on tap, waitress shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know. I asked for an Oktoberfest, as I figured it was seasonal and every place had it. That took 15 minutes for the server to come back yo notify me that they were waiting for pint glasses to come out of the dishwasher to pour my beer (???).  Another 6-7 minutes later, the waitress came back to bring my bowl of soup which came out before my child's order which had been placed 20 minutes before. At that point I asked for my beer order to be cancelled. Granted, once my child's order came out, a pint of Oktoberfest came on the house. I appreciate the damage control, but at this point I was very frustrated and appalled at the lack of service. I have been here for close to 1 hour, and the large table next to us remains with all the dirty plates and utensils piled up. No manager in sight either, going around asking how everything was, as chain restaurants usually have. Lack of service and quality? understaffed? Likely all of the above.

Besides her, there was nothing redeemable about Friday's.   The worst thing about it is my girlfriend said let's go to Applebee's and I put up a stink about it.  We ordered jack Daniels boneless wings, 15-20 minutes later wings came out, on bone.  We sent it back.  I ordered Cajun pasta shrimp and chicken with NO CHICKEN, as I don't eat meat. You guessed it, there was chicken all throughout. We sent it back.  After 20 minutes of waiting for my meal without chicken, I told Michelle to cancel the order.   Her manager came out later and she asked to take it off of my bill the manager asked her why, she told him, and he never even came over to ask if everything was ok or apologize. I didn't get his name but he was a shorter Asian man with a chefs jacket on. Probably the worst customer service I have ever received. It honestly was an embarrassment.   The chances of me going back to this Friday's is less than 1% I'd only come back here if I wanted to die of starvation before I got the wrong meal sent out to me.    Such a shame. I love Friday's.  Keep going down 1-9 to a different restaurant. This place stunk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden
Uneka H.,"Rahway, NJ",41,181,433,2.0,8/21/2017,"So my friends and I came to this TGIF of course because we were hungry and I also wanted to try the endless apps. It was a Sunday night, so it wasn't a lot of people it wasn't crowded like it normally is sometimes. It was 5 of us that ordered including 3 young adults so I could understand the food taking a little long to prepare. However, the service or the food wasn't great.  My mozzarella sticks came out with no mariner sauce. Although I had the endless apps, I had to keep waving down the waitress to order more food. We waited about 20-30 minutes just to get our food, then another 15 minutes for butter, sauce, refill on drinks, then another 20 minutes ""after"" we asked for the check, it was ridiculous. Particularly, because there was another table across from us that was disputing the check because it was wrong. The crazy thing is, when we looked at our check-that was wrong too so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get it fixed (smh).  Not so sure I will be returning to this location or any TGIF Friday's for that matter because the service wasn't good at the other location either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-linden

I've experienced attitude from staff, over the phone and in person. Fridays should invest in a secret shopper (I'm seriously for hire); otherwise they're likely to see a decline in their customer base.

We were greeted by our server Aaron after we got seated and he was helpful and pleasant.  Had the pick 3 sampler for appetizer and I had their smoked stacked burger.  For the sampler we had the warm pretzels, loaded potato skins, boneless wings with garlic parmesan.  The pretzel was extremely salty.  The loaded potato skins were flavorful and tasty.  Boneless wings were delicious and good.  Kind of reminds me of the korean fried chicken flavor.  The smoked stacked burger was big.  Comes with 2 thin beef patties and some bacon.  Just the right amount of BBQ sauce.  It was a little too well done but still tasted pretty good.

Today, my husband I went to the TGI Fridays in Linden for lunch. We were seated right away and our waiter stopped by to take our drink and food orders promptly. However, it took a long while before we received our food. The restaurant wasn't busy. Then, when we were done eating, we had to ask for our check because our waiter seemed to have been waiting for more tables than he could handle. He kept going back and forth from the kitchen to different tables. When we finally received our food, we were very disappointed. We both ordered the same thing - Parmesan crusted Chicken which came with a side of Mac n' cheese and a small mozzarella/tomato salad. The chicken was only one small piece and the mozzarella/tomato salad was literally a spoonful. The only decent sized serving was the Mac n' cheese. Not what we were expecting for $14!

The meal was definitely not worth the money. Also, my beer glass was chipped, I told the waiter and yet nothing was done. I can't really blame the waiter since he was obviously new.

Yes there appetizers are frozen, then deep fried and brought to your table, but they taste sooooo good.  The pros are: you come during happy hour and appetizers are 50% off, they have low calorie options and there cocktails give you the sting you need :) The cons: the waiters here need a little more training. Every time I come here they tend to bring the plates of my party at different times, so your friend might start eating before you!

This was closest one to my house and my friend had a gift card, he wanted to treat us. Just came from work, professional looking at least I thought so and since I wasn't paying I grabbed my ID, a credit card (just in case) and my keys.  We all got there, sat at the bar and ordered our drinks, the bartender asked us for ID.  I took mine out my pocket and I accidentally grabbed the expired driver license (oops_) It was a month old but that's besides the point.  The bartender said, ""this is expired!"" ( I didn't know these bartenders were part time cops)  I said , I know it was an honest mistake but my DOB is on there, stating I am 35 YEARS OLD. She  told me rudely that she will have to speak with her manager.  She then brought the drinks for everyone there with me and then spoke out loudly, I CANNOT SERVE YOU ALCOHOL would like a soda?  I thought to myself, do I look like a pepsi drinking kind of girl? I then had to have one of my friends leave her drink (side note_-the ice never melted in the alcoholic drink)  and drive me home 10 mins to get my valid ID to show the bartender/part time cop that all is well with me and the department of motor vehicles. (How bout them apples??) Still yet to see the manager who never came over to say.. well anything.  Geez I know it's a chain restaurant  but a little professionalism goes a long way.  By this time I was famished so I figured since she made the worse drinks ( I should of asked for her valid mixology license) .. I would just get an $11 (ish) salad cause ya can't really mess up a salad?  Or Can ya? The most salty Yucatan chipotle chicken salad ever and I think someone ate some of my chicken before I got it, I saw like a strip. With that said, I WILL NEVER EVER EAT THERE AGAIN!

Wes D.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,21,,3.0,11/10/2011,"I come here all the time with customers as it is right down the street from work. There is something on the menu for everyone and the food is pretty consistent.  The 3-course meal specials that they offer are a great deal; you get a choice of appetizer (and good ones like pot-stickers and quesadillas), one of about 7 entrees and a dessert for either 13 or 17 bucks. The entrees in the higher price range often have seafood/shrimp. Definitely have to finish up your meal with a slice of chocolate peanut butter pie. To be honest, all their desserts are amazing.  My favorite dish is the sizzling Parmesan chicken that comes out on a skillet still steaming and bubbling with fried cheesy deliciousness. My boss loves the fried fish and chips.  Not feeling a post-lunch food coma? The California club sandwich with turkey, ham, bacon and avocado goes great with those crispy home fries. yum!

Phillip P.,"Linden, NJ",0,30,1,1.0,6/11/2015,"What happens to ""chain"" restaurants after they open in Linden ? All is well for a week or two and then all bets are off. Standards go downhill quickly. Food quality , service,and cleanliness all suffer. This is most definitely the case with Fridays in Linden. Their bar transgressions are well documented. The lax attitude of a management team that turns a blind eye to a rude clientelle and turns a place that should be family friendly into anything but is obvious. The turnover of personnel is constant with each new group being worse than the previous one. Orders are almost always incorrect and never really corrected. Food is presented in such a careless , unappealing manner. Service is notoriously bad. Servers here have mastered the art of being overly intrusive untill it's time for your check .By then you better start checking milk cartons because they're nowhere to be found. Last but not least-can common sense make an occasional appearance here? Does a 55 year old woman really need her ID to order a drink ? To be denied service for such a thing is an absolute and total joke. Just because you tried to scam customers with low quality booze in top shelf bottles and got caught doesn't mean you need to have contempt for the customer. It's only gonna get worse.
