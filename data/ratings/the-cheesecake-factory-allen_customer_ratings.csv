Although I do find their book-sized menu to be a little anxiety inducing, their food is always good. Pricey, but good. The Allen location is no exception. Went there this Friday expecting a long wait but it only took us about 20 minutes to be seated. Service was great. Food was great. Cheesecake was even better. I think the company has even managed to squeeze in some additional cheesecake flavors on the menu, thus causing me to seriously consider spending an unmentionable amount of money to sample a few interesting looking options. Thankfully, my dining partner encouraged me to stick with my usual - the coconut chocolate cheesecake. Yum! The only drawback about this location is the parking. As with all things in the Allen/McKinney suburbs this place is packed and parking is hard to find. Fortunately, the restaurant offers complimentary valet.

95,April J.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,1.0,2013-05-18,"Maybe we ordered the wrong meal but our first and probably last visit to the Cheesecake Factory was for lack of a better word ""Horrible"". Hubby ordered the grilled pork chop which was oddly very sweet. His corn was scorched ""only way I can describe  the taste"" and both of our Margaritas were watered down. I ordered the Shrimp pasta. My shrimp were overly breaded burnt and soggy soggy. My pasta was not topped with arugula it was covered with a mountain of this stuff completely ruined the dish. On the upside hubby's mashed potatoes were pretty good and the hot wings were decent  but I've had better at Applebee's and Outback. Needless to say we both ate about 20% of our meal. Decided against trying the Cheesecake and my husband told waitress no thank you on the to go boxes for vast amount of food left on our plate.

If I know my friends or family are coming, I make sure I tag along. On my last visit, I ordered the mushroom burger. When it came time for my table to have its food delivered, my burger didn't make it. A food runner or another server came by and asked if I ordered a veggie burger, which I declined. It turns out my mushroom burger accidentally ran to the wrong table. Honestly, I didn't mind at all, as I wasn't that hungry. Two people plus a manager stopped by my table to apologize about the situation. After a multitude of sorries (which I thought wasn't a big deal after all) I finally got my mushroom burger. It only took like, an extra 10 minutes. The server even said that they will comp my meal...seriously? Well, the people who work here must freak out a lot or are just genuinely apologetic. They must be lucky that I'm not one of those fussy types of customers who get aggravated easily for no big reason. Mistakes happen. I get it.  Speaking of which, I hope a genuine vegetarian didn't mistakenly consume an actual burger - now THAT would suck.  I'm not really going to comment a lot about the taste of the food, since almost everyone has eaten at The Cheesecake Factory, among all corporate-type restaurants. I will say the mushroom burger wasn't at all bad. And be sure to never leave without indulging into their cheesecakes, obviously.

36,Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544.0,4.0,2013-06-20,"All of the Cheesecake Factory locations are great for their large menu. When you're trying to feed a variety of tastes there's pretty much always something for someone here. I also really love them for their skinnylicious menu now that I'm trying to lose the baby weight! This location is definitely on par with other locations in their food quality. This is what we had: -White Chicken Chili = One of my favorite dishes they have. It's hearty, warm, spicy and filling! I love the heat from the green chilis and it's not thin at all. It's very much like a chili and makes you feel so full with a HUGE amount of flavor. The fact that it's also on their low cal ""skinnylicious menu"" just makes it better. - Miso Salmon - My husband got this (added a picture of it) and not only is it beautifully presented but it's REALLY tasty. Highly recommend it. - Skinnylicious Soft Tacos - Comes with three tacos with chicken and veggies and a spicy sauce. My grandparents both ordered this and although they like spicy they said it was more heat than they expected. Just FYI! They loved it though and felt that the three tacos was a really ample portion. My step-grandmother even brought one home to eat later. - Skinnylicious Grilled Turkey Burger - My mom got this and said that it was tasty. She wasn't ooh'ing and aah'ing over it though. This location lost a star though because I had some of the worst customer service when I went here for Father's Day. We called ahead to see if they were doing a list and the hostess laughed at me and in a rude way said ""Uh, no, we don't do lists."" So I was already irritated when I arrived with my husband and I, our newborn and my grandparents. Then we were seated and had the RUDEST waitress we have ever had, to write all the sarcastic/rude things she said/did would take forever. Just know that in the first 30 mins there (when we still didn't have food) my husband was so appalled by her behavior he went and complained to a manager. So.... food? awesome. Service? Not so much. To be fair, I did see some other nice waiters and waitresses and the manager that apologized to us for our waitress and for our food taking forever (and being wrong once, because our waitress put it in wrong) was also nice.

There was one random day when we went on a Tuesday night, literally 9 people had celebrated their birthdays in that time! Crazy!

We went here for my mom's birthday and this place is right down the street from the homestead. This location was not good. Wait time was long but that is completely fine as it was a Friday night. You'd have to be crazy to expect a wait time any shorter than 30 minutes on a Friday night. Our server was obviously over sat and it took him a good 15 minutes or so to even acknowledge we were there. By the time he actually got to us, we had so much time that we had the entire meal already selected. Not to put him down or anything of the sort but you have to at least say something to the table like ""I'll be with you in a minute, what can I get you to drink?"" and then ask for help. But even our server was not that big of a deal to us (we're really laid back). It was my meal...It took about 30 minutes to get it out to the table after we ordered. By that time I was ravenous. I was on this no carb gluten free kick so I ordered a no bun turkey burger. Now out of all the times I've been to Cheesecake factory more times than I can count. I've never gotten the same thing twice (cheesecake excluded) and I've never been disappointed until now. I can't even describe the taste as an actual flavor. Imagine if you will the smell of new born puppy breath. Now take that smell, translate it into taste and put it in some poor sap's burger...that's the only way I can describe it...puppy breath. Couldn't even take another bite I was so nauseated. Ordered something different no problem (my mom's steak was way over cooked also). Over all, not a good experience for my Clan.

She was very nice and even went to double check that the caesar dressing they had didn't have raw eggs since I'm pregnant. Pick up was a breeze and the girl I ordered from was there and another guy. Such a pleasant place to order from! On to the food. I ordered chicken mushroom lettuce wraps, dinner sized chicken caesar salad and red velvet cheesecake. Once I got home and got everything out, it all looked pretty great. The lettuce wraps are almost laughable though. They give you little thin pieces of lettuce to try to maneuver the chicken onto...I ended up just using the lettuce like giant chopsticks when I gave up on strategically spooning the chicken into the lettuce leaves and having everything fall apart.  The caesar salad looked delicious and I've been craving one for a while. Tried the chicken before eating and it was SO yummy! Juicy and seasoned just right. The dressing...left to be desired for a good caesar. I'm not sure if they gave me the skinny dressing instead of regular (I ordered the regular) but it had a faint taste of yogurt to it and pretty much ruined the salad. Tastes nothing like good dressing should. Red Velvet cheesecake though, that was the best part of my entire meal! Kind of upset that I spent over $30 expecting to get good quality food then ended up pretty disappointed with what they had to offer.

131,Curtis Humanities S.,"Allen, TX",0,21,2.0,5.0,2014-06-03,"Is the Cheesecake Factory Worth All the Hype? - 2DC With all the hype, I couldn't help but eat here, and the inner critic in me had no reason to resist either. So with anticipating feelings seemingly like that of a college graduate coming into the risky money-sucking adult life, I waltzed in and opened the doors into the famous diner. I ordered an Americana Cheeseburger, with burger cooked medium rare, along with French fries as a side. What came after my meal was given to me was a delightful and astonishing experience that left me wanting more. Right when you walk in, a full team of greeters are ready at attention by a counter on your left, with their black uniforms and the speed they handled things they were like a fully operational SWAT team. As my mother and I were led to our table, walking by fancy Egyptian like pillars, I noticed the cheerful yet fancy atmosphere of the place. You could hear the chatter of waiters and diners, as well as the clinging of plates and pans coming everywhere. We were given a menu as soon as we sat down. The menu was long, a bit overwhelming, but the food descriptions were short yet descriptive. This way, I could know what exactly I wanted. A waiter came to us soon after we were given a table, unfortunately I forgot his name, but he was quite friendly and nice. After giving us our drinks and taking our orders, he gave us some appetizing bread which was well baked. I excused myself to the bathroom, as it is common knowledge that the state of a restaurant's bathroom equals the state of their kitchen. Their bathroom was quite clean and spacey, so I could now fully enjoy my meal knowing it wasn't cooked in a disgusting place. The wait for our food was quite lengthy, about 20 minutes, I expected they would be more efficient especially at lunch time. But when I saw our waiter walking up with our orders, it was like heaven had opened and the angels were singing. My meal was nicely arranged, and it took me all of my strength not to stuff it all down in one go. The burger was quite big, causing me to cut it in half. But as I bit down, the great juiciness and cheesiness of the food hit me all at once. I could tell the meat was prepared carefully, and the delicate handiwork of the chef showed through the food. The fries had the right amount of crispness and saltiness. Everything was perfect. The fantastic meal filled me up pretty quickly, and we asked for some takeout boxes, only for our waiter to take it up and prepare the boxes himself, showcasing the restaurant's great service. Needless to say, me and my entourage left very pleased, and we felt we certainly got our money's worth. I beat myself up for waiting 14 years to dine at the Cheesecake Factory, and I certainly will find myself going back. They have great service, and although the wait is a bit lengthy, it's worth it. I definitely recommend visiting this restaurant, during lunch or dinner, either way you won't leave feeling unsatisfied.

I could tell that the manager was reluctant to come over because he kept looking at our table and looking away as the bus boy was talking to him. he finally came over and the first thing he says was, ""so you guys have been waiting a while?"" I didn't catch his name because he didn't bother introducing himself, so he may not have even been a manager for all we know. all I know of him is that he's tall, skinny and bald. I assume he's a manager because he wasn't in white. but again, he didn't introduce himself so who knows.  we gave the ""manager"" our order and he walks off. a couple minutes later, the girl that was working the birthday table next to us came over to apologize because ""the table you're sitting at hasn't been used all night so we didn't know who it beloved to."" her and the guy waiter were working both tables around us and yet no one bothers to check to see who has the table that's sitting there with menus and no drinks? by the time we finally got our beers and two slices of cheesecakes (that are premade and comes to the restaurant frozen, no cooking required) the table that sat AFTER us already had their food, that I assume is made to order. to the waitress' credit, after we made our complaint, she was very attentive afterwards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=60,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.404,3.4400000000000004

148,Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772.0,5.0,2014-10-12,"THE RESTAURANT--You and I have both been to a restaurant that after being seated we ask why are we here. There is no intrigue and the place might as well be part of a haunted house. Not this Cheesecake Factory location. This is a location that you can be comfortable when taking your spouse, your girl friend or business client to lunch or dinner. The inside if the restaurant if very nice with dark woods on the seats and counters and light pastel colors on the walls and ceiling. Just a very nice setting in which to enjoy your food. Parking is scarce out front of the restaurant and more than likely you will have to find a space in the parking garage just a few feet to the south. Parking is free. The rest room for men is nice but very small. There is only one commode and one urinal for men in a restaurant of this size which probably does not meet code standards.  THE FOOD   I have been here many times and I have decided I concentrated too much on things other than the food. We started with some fresh iced tea and coffee. I must have gotten the first glass of iced tea and it was perfect with a  deep tea flavor that had not been watered down by having sat in ice for an hour. The coffee was freshly brewed and as good a cup as you can get even if purchased at a  coffee shop. Bread was brought to the table and that was a loaf of white and a loaf of dark wheat bread with real butter in the basket. The breads were excellent. Today we ordered for lunch, the Herb Crusted Salmon, mashed new potatoes and asparagus with the salmon being covered with a not too overpowering lemon sauce. The salmon was some of the best we have ever tasted and the lemon sauce made the presentation excellent. The lemon sauce is a little tart nevertheless delicious. The piece of salmon was about 1 1/2 inch thick with the size being most generous. The asparagus was crisp and tender and cooked perfectly as were the new mashed potatoes. THE SERVICE   Was met at the hostess counter by a nice hostess who asks where we would like to sit. That was a first time we have ever been ask where we like to sit at this location and we chose a small booth, which we were promptly, taken to. The waiter was outstanding in taking our order and most efficient in brining our food as quickly as it was prepared. The food was still very hot as was the plate on which it was being served. PRICING    The menu at a Cheesecake Factor is extensive. We had decided on the herb crusted salmon at $19.95 when the waiter ask if we desired the lunch portion or dinner portion. There was a $6.00 difference in the price thus lunch was only $13.95. We opted for the lunch portion and that was plenty of food. The menu had dozens and dozens of items on it and is actually like a loose leaf notebook. It will take sometime to browse through the entire ""book"". If you are there during lunch hours (7 days a week) be sure and ask about the lunch menu.  Today was a great ding experience with very good food at a very reasonable price.

This is the worst execution of a Cheesecake Factory location I've been too.    Let's face it, Cheesecake Factory is (at it's core) is an upscale diner chain. With that in mind, the price points are high but generally proportionate to the ""OMG, I'm going to need a to go box when my order arrives"" sub-theme of success that many chain restaurants embrace now (i.e. Olive Garden, Maggiano,s, etc..). I could go several paragraphs about that corporate restaurant strategy, but back to the subject at hand.    Yesterday, we decided to give the Allen CF another try. Amazingly, we were seated immediately w/o any attitude or clumsiness by the usually inept host staff that has ruled this location with rudeness and indifference as if it's encouraged and rewarded by management. We arrived at 4PM and the restaurant was about 1/3 full. Usually a good sign of prompt service we were greeted by a server who (throughout the meal) was consistently 2 steps behind in hitting service points. Each of us (party of four) ordered something different, but nothing unusual - no modifiers, splits or anything that could slow down overall service. At this point I'll cut to the chase: 2 pasta dishes were flavorless and incomplete in preparation another ( a pepperoni pizza) seemed to be a facsimile of an actual proper pizza and the turkey burger I ordered came out as a turkey club. I sent it back (held on to the side salad) and was assured my turkey burger would arrive asap. When it did arrive it was a flavorless mess on a 4"" cold white bun.

42,Kendra P.,"Wylie, TX",17,9,,3.0,2014-12-31,Cheesecake is generally a very good restaurant. We have been going to cheesecake for years and the Allen location for approximately 3 years or so.. The service and quality of the food used to be fantastic but the last 3 times we have eaten there it has been pretty disappointing. The food has either been cold or over cooked each time we have been there over our last 3 visits. When you have a family of 7 and you go to a restaurant that is over a $100 to feed your family you expect good quality food and this location just has not met the service/quality levels over the last few months.  The location by north park mall is still fantastic but the Allen location has definitely fell off with service and quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=140,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.2440000000000007,3.0000000000000004

Wait time for 2 was about 10-15 minutes so at least it was true  to what they said it would be. I hate it when they say it's 30 minutes and it's more like 45 to an hour. I'd rather them lie and say it would take longer and be called earlier than to be late, but perhaps that's just me. You're always welcome to make reservations.  Atmosphere: There's dim lighting, but decor is always extravangant but not too gaudy. It can be loud because of the amount of customers they have. The place has always been clean for me.  Service: Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. She came over just enough times to meet our needs without being too overbearing or seem liked she was ignoring us.  Food: I'm always a fan of the complimentary bread and butter. Their dishes are definitely big so it's a good idea to share. My husband and I had the Thai Chili wraps and the shepherd's pie. The wraps are so good and it's huge so it can easily be your meal. You get 5-6 pieces of lettuce, accompanied with marinated and grilled chicken slices, and you can dress it with pickled cucumbers, thai noodles, carrot slices, and bean sprouts. You also get 3 sauces to choose from; sweet, peanut sauce, and spicy. I sometimes throw it all together. This dish can get messy, but it's all good. The pie was so comforting to eat on a cold evening. I feel as if the mashed potatoes encase the rest of the ingredients so well that it keeps the dish warm with every bite and everything is so flavorful. I found myself still picking at it even after I was already full. We were too full for cheesecake this time, but perhaps next time.  I need to try other foods next time, but that's what I said the last time that I was here. I can't stay away from my favorites.

Luckily, my mom loves the whole wheat bread in the table basket. My dad ordered off the skinnylicious menu, and his pasta was seriously overcooked. It had the consistency of spoiled rice left at the bottom of a pot. Since it was inedible, he asked for a replacement and was given bowtie pasta with his shrimp with which he was okay. My mom ordered Bang Bang Chicken and was happy with it. I ha the rigatoni with shrimp and Italian sausage. It was passable. Usually I get excited with big portions due to my gluttonous nature, but I wasn't really that amped to eat my leftovers. The remaining dishes were also unremarkable. There were no lights in our eyes as we ate, but no one threw up either. Nevertheless, we were very pleased with our server Josh. He was quite attentive and knew when to interject.

Parking is not too bad if you don't mind walking a little, there's plenty in the garage next door. I've also ordered through the phone a few times and picked up.

Without truly knowing who our server was our drink order was finally taken- but not in it's entirety, nude test was taken buy a different guy who wasn't our server but ended up helping her out. He brought us wrapped silverware( the first ones weren't). Our food orders were placed after drink orders were finally corrected. Please tell me WHY ALL OF OUR FOOD ORDERS CAME OUT SEPARATELY????!!!!! There was about a 10 minute lag between each order coming out. This was completely unbelievable! We had to ask for the menu again to order some cheesecake and the girl server asked if we wanted it to go....even though there was at least 45 minutes until closing.

The tables are a tad small so I was happy I was alone. I find many places have these small tables, it bothers me.  I was seated promptly as I arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon. The gal seating me was neither mean or friendly just seemed unhappy. The waitress was of similar disposition. It didnt bother me as she was attentive and I was enjoying being alone. I ordered an Arnold Palmer which was served very cold rimmed with sugar. I really like this as the Grand Lux is the only other place I have had it served this way. It was a great drink. The bread was not toasted well which makes sour dough very chewy. It was not good. I ordered the lunch portion of spaghetti and meatballs and it was very good and the right amount of food.  Well it is the Cheesecake factory so it doesnt make sense to me to go there and not have a slice for dessert. (Also why the lunch portion was ordered)  I had the Mango Key Lime slice with a cup of coffee. It was delicious!!!! The macaroon crust with a layer of shredded coconut made me smile.

We should have honestly left at that point, but we order our appetizers and drinks.  Fried macaroni balls and avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg roll sauce sounded good on the menu, we get this black bubbly liquid that was awful. The fried cheese macaroni appetizer wasn't much better, it was burnt on the outside and undercooked pasta on the in. I order chicken teriyaki and brown rice and my friend orders that truffle honey chicken. We were both planning on dessert but when I bit into my chicken it tasted wet and cold. Skin was still attached and it felt like it was frozen before boiled and teriyaki sauce dumped on it. It wasn't good at all. I went into the restroom and had to throw up from it. There was jasmine rice and something diced and put on the side that looked like chopped onions, something stuck there beside the chicken that was burnt along with the outside of the chicken skin but the inside wasn't cooked all the way through.

It's been 6 months and thought I'd give them another try at making some Bang bang Chicken and Bang bang Shrimp.  Good news is that they didn't overcook it this time... but then i gave the to-go person plenty of warning.  I was NOT intetested in writing a bad review.  I wanted to enjoy that GREAT delicious Bang bang like we used to do 5 years ago.   But, alas,  just as bad as over cooking  is that the flavor just isn't there any more.  My wife said she thought her BBChicken tasted bitter.  She couldn't eat it.  She tried a little sugar on it.  Didn't help.  In the trash it went .. $25 down the drain.  Stick a fork in us cause we're done.  No more Cheese Cake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=20,2.36,3.25,3.25,,2.8939999999999997
192,Sarah V.,"McKinney, TX",22,3,,1.0,2017-09-25,"My 1 yr kibash of this restaurant ended recently.  The ban was because of repeated bad customer service.  Went there last Saturday, early evening, with my daughters.  Was told there was a 15-20 minute wait, not bad for a Saturday evening.  Was given a pager and we sat 5 ft from the hostess stand.  After about 20 minutes, I noticed that people who came in after us were being seated, I asked the hostess.  Was told, very rudely ""We tried paging you a long time ago"", uh, no you didn't ""but we have immediate seating outside.  Great, I'll take it.  The hostess tried to sit us at a table covered in bird poo.  NASTY!  Told her we couldn't sit there, not going to make my daughters eat of feces.  She tried to sit us at another table that was worse.  Commented, hoping that she would remedy the issue...have someone clean it up, sanitize us, get us the next table inside.  Nope, that was obviously too much to ask.  My comment was met with a blank stare, i opted to leave.  If a restaurant cares so little about their customers, as I have experienced multiple times over at this facility, I don't need to go there anymore.  Perma-ban of this one.  There are way too many restaurants in the area to subject my family to a restaurant that wants you to eat in poo and be treated rudely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=20,2.24,3.21,3.21,,2.822

We come here for dessert a few times a year and I never bother writing a review but had to do so for Wyatt, he was great. If you sit at the bar find his section he will take great care of you. The food is good the chocolate cake is why I went, pumpkin cheesecake is why other members of our party went.

117,Alan C.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-23,"I had the WORST experience of my life tonight with a curbside to-go order.   When the order for my family was placed at 6:15 p.m., I was told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes.  I arrived at 6:35 p.m., parked in the designated area and called to have my order brought out.  I was told that it would be brought out in just a minute.   TWENTY minutes later, still no food delivered!  My wife called the restaurant and spoke to a female manger who said that she would check what was holding up my order.  Now I have been waiting in the parking lot for THIRTY minutes without food or a follow-up call/visit from any manager.   Finally, a server who brought out someone ELSE'S order, (!) stopped at my car to ask my name and if I had an order!!!  I told her the story and she finally brought out my order ... 45 minutes AFTER I arrived and 65 minutes after the order was placed! Just to add insult to injury, NO manager or server even apologized or made any attempt to correct/comp the situation.   TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!   I used to enjoy table dining at the Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience, I'm not sure I EVER want to bring my family there again! You either perform a service correctly, or you do NOT offer it at all.  They FAILED on ALL counts tonight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen,2.2,3.18,3.18,,2.7880000000000003
102,Jessica B.,"McKinney, TX",45,33,74.0,4.0,2017-11-05,"After a bit of shopping went to get a bite at Cheesecake Factory.  I've never have a bad experience at CF unless you count waiting for a table at some of the locations can take up to an hour.  I usually order the Jambalaya extra spicy but considering it was lunch (and it is one of the items that you can't order half portion)  I decide to try something new.  I order the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken (lunch portion) and had them make it a little spicier. It had a nice crunch, heat, and sweetness with mango pieces and loved the snow peas.   Cheesecake Factory give huge portions - so you definitely need to make sure before ordering too much food.  We def were too full to order a delicious cheesecake at the table.  My number 1 pick is the White  Chocolate  Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake! So good and travels home just fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen,2.16,3.17,3.17,,2.766
101,Bruce C.,"Richardson, TX",372,609,245.0,4.0,2017-11-21,"To start they'll bring you some sourdough and pumpernickel bread with real butter.  It's a great start to your meal.  If you've never been, here's what you need to do. Ignore the menu, your eyes will fall out as it is huge. You should choose from the Shepherds Pie, the Meatloaf or the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  Start there, you won't be disappointed unless you like bland food.  On top of that, they have cheesecake! Some of the best cheesecake around.  Do yourself a favor and don't come here on Friday or Saturday night from 6-8p or you'll be waiting that whole time to get a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen,2.28,3.16,3.16,,2.8080000000000003

100,Lindsy H.,"Allen, TX",429,707,1284.0,5.0,2017-11-30,"Why do they have to offer curbside to go?!! It's my downfall, oh and the fact that Favor (app food delivery service) will deliver them to your door!! I've been known to pack my jammie clad little ones into the car in the evening because Mommy is craving a slice of cheesecake. I've even found myself stuck home while hubby is on a business trip and I don't want to cook dinner so, Favor to the rescue! We're having Cheesecake Factory for dinner. And maybe a slice or two of cheesecake too. One thing you can absolutely say about CF is their portions do not leave you hungry.  I've recently enjoyed... + Beets w/Goat Cheese salad - fresh, tasty and great portion + Chicken Samosas - great portion of chicken, the flavor and spice are right on. Do yourself a favor and ask for extra Cilantro dipping sauce  + Thai Lettuce Wraps are my favorite - this can easily be a meal, not just an appetizer. There is a great amount of chicken and toppings and the spicy Thai sauces are YUMMY! + Avocado Egg Rolls - divine. Crunchy outside, perfectly cooked inside. Also make sure to ask for extra dipping sauce, it's really tasty + Chinese Chicken Salad - it's HUGE! I request keeping the Rice Noodles off as they just overwhelm the bowl and have zero taste.  + Kids Grilled Cheese - my boys love this one. It's a full size grilled cheese presented in a kid-friendly and appealing way. Plus their fries are so good you'll want to eat them too. And of course Cheesecake. Currently I have three favorites, the Celebration Cheesecake, the S'mores Cheesecake and the new Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme Cheesecake.

Drinks cost about $3, which is a lot more compared to most other places, but they do allow for refills. I had the spaghetti and was disappointed about it. It comes at a price of $17. Quantity wise, the spaghetti is pretty alright, but quality wise it's taste is not as pleasing.

I had the meatloaf and was blown away! The flavors are superb and the portion huge. Served with a corn vegetable medley that was popping hot and outstanding. The mashed potatoes are as good as it gets. It's all topped with a high quality beef gravy. The pre meal bread is addictive and the extensive selection of heart-stopping cheese cake slices is astonishing.  So, while prices may seem high, it's justified by the quality and quantity you receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen,2.44,3.11,3.11,,2.8419999999999996
