Since they are a chain, they are also consistent, which I am phappy with. We're traveling from out of town, and they're close to the Holiday Inn. I know that Hutto is a small town, so it's nice to see that they have something mainstream. We came here right at their 10:30 pm closing, and the servers were all super nice, and treated us like regulars. I ordered drinks, and made sure I knew that they would stop serving at some point. This is what I ordered - ""Three flour tortillas with crispy chicken, applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, honey-chipotle drizzle and ranch dressing.""

13,M F.,"Pflugerville, TX",22,82,41.0,1.0,2013-07-30,"I have never enjoyed the thought of going to this Chillis.  I thought I'd try it again with my family of six last night since we had a coupon for a free appetizer... Let me say again, I was greatly reminded of why I hate this place.  Put yourself in my heels... #1.  Our waitress was a girl with dark short hair and a red bandana tied around her head (maybe so someone can have a talk with her).... Doubt it though.  She literally approached our table by saying ""just letting you guys know my name is _______ and they just cut me from working an all day shift and I'm exhausted so I'll be starting your order but the other waitress is kindof new... (pause)... She's somewhere in the back.... (pause)... So uh, when she comes out I guess we'll just do it like that."" WTF??  She actually said this all very slow, with a little more talking too and my table was like, is she kidding right now???  Too much drama if you ask me, we're just here to eat and don't care about how unorganized the restaurant is OR how tired YOU are!  What ever happened to customer service?? #2.  It took ten minutes to get two house margaritas and one tropical sunrise, two kids drinks, and a tea.  (This is so late on a Monday there were only about four tables dining in at the time.)  When the other waitress dropped them off, the two house margaritas were missing the top inch and a half of drink!!  I said ""um, excuse me, but it looks like someone just drank our drinks so can you actually bring them full??"" the waitress, ""oh, you want them topped off?"" YES!  *head in hands* #3.  It took ONE HOUR... That's right, one whole hour to get four appetizers!  Nachos, potato skins, egg rolls, and fries.  Really?!?  Can someone please tell me why the hell it takes ONE HOUR for these simple little portions of food??  Wtf?  In one hour I could have changed my car oil myself, polished my toenails, watered my garden, sprayed some ant piles, and had a glass of wine.  What were they doing back there in the kitchen??  Is there even a kitchen?!  Cooks??  Jeez!   #4. I asked for jalapeños on the side for my potato skins, of course they didn't come out, so I asked Rosie The Rivetter who was cleaning the section around us for them and she said, ""oh they didn't come out?  Hold on a sec."". She goes back to the kitchen, then walks right by our table with a new rag to wipe down her tables and continues to clean... I'm sure you know I never got them... This place is slow, unapologetic, wrapped up in themselves, and severely lacking on their customer service.  STEP UP YOUR GAME and focus on your guests!!  Thank goodness we didn't order actual entrees cause we would have been skeletons with drinks in our hands by the time the food came out!  Ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

43,Maggie S.,"Elgin, TX",79,26,,1.0,2015-09-06,"We came for lunch with my in-laws at 12:30 PM. We were seated by 12:40. The restaurant was busy but by no means was it overcrowded. Appetizer (skillet queso) came at 1:00, 15 minutes after we ordered it. It was lukewarm, but we were hungry and essentially licked the dish clean. Over the next hour our waiter came by multiple times and either refused to make eye contact or glanced our way and then went in the opposite direction. He did not come back to refill our empty drinks OR communicate any reasons for the wait. At 2:00 my husband was finally annoyed enough to get the attention of a different waiter, to ask him to find ours. Several minutes later, our waiter arrived with our food. Our greasy, barely warm, congealed food. The burgers were dry, the steak was overdone, and the cheese on all the plates was hard as a rock. The food had obviously sat for a long time. My husband asked the waiter about his burger (which should have had onion rings but instead had raw onions) and the waiter argued with him for several minutes. The waiter apologized for the wait AND told us that he knew it wasn't our ""fault"" that we came at a busy time but we did. Finally, a manager came over and told us he could remake the food but it would take just as long. No thanks. We left and got our lunch at another restaurant.

We were seated and obviously their ""buddy"" ""wasn't a very good server"" either. Verbatim. Chili's lost at least a $100 check from us. Starving from the Warrior Dash too. If you work at the same place, unless you are in corporate work, which is still petty, work FOR each other.

I will say they were busy but it was just 2 salads. it took about 50 minutes to get our food, which we were patient because our server was new and they were a little crowded, but when the food came out it, there was no sauce on my MIL ribs, my steak which was supposed to me medium was WELL WELL done..

37,Meghan M.,"Hutto, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-22,"Whoever owns the Chili's in Hutto really needs to get their ducks in a row!  We only visit this restaurant when we don't want to drive the extra 10-15 minutes to the Stone Hill location.  I think the only reason this restaurant is still open is because of the convenience and the brand.  The staff is hit or miss, some people are great but most of them need to be re-trained and then re-trained again.   On one occasion, I ordered a salad to-go and they FORGOT THE LETTUCE.  On another occasion, I ordered a side salad in place of french fries to-go and they forgot to give me the salad completely so I had to go back.   This last trip though really takes the cake....  My friend and I were seated and attended to quickly at the beginning.  We ordered an appetizer and one strawberry alcoholic drink that was new to the menu.  After about 15-20 minutes our server comes by to see how we are doing and then says ""Oh!  You had an appetizer..  It must still be cooking in the back.  I'll go check on it and bring you your drink in a minute."" then we order the rest of our food.  I have come to expect slow service from this place and we aren't in any rush thankfully so it's not a big deal.  Our server brings the drink out and the appetizer then walks away without asking if everything is okay.  The app is fine but my drink isn't the right flavor.  She brought out the original vodkatini thing instead of the strawberry.  Again, not a big deal in the grand scheme of things because I'm going to drink it regardless because that's just me but I did want to bring it to her attention that it wasn't what I asked for.  When she came back around and I told her ""It's not a big deal because I'm going to drink it anyways but I did originally ask for this to be strawberry."" her response was ""You want strawberries?"" Me: 'No, no, I had asked for the strawberry version of this drink, it's on the menu' Her: ""do you want me to bring you a side of strawberry syrup?"" Me: 'um, no that's..okay.  It's fine. Thank you.'           How odd, right??     Moving on to the actual meal, my friend gets her food and everything looks good, I get my salad (quesadilla explosion salad) and the lettuce is brown...  At this point I have given up all hope on this joint and its ability to handle salads. (Over the years I have gotten the burgers and the club sandwiches and they turn out OK) Other chili's restaurants kick this chili's butt majorly when it comes to quality and taste of food but again it all boils down to convenience. I never said anything about the salad because it's late and I didn't feel like waiting another 20-30 minutes for a new salad that probably wouldn't be much better.  FINALLY, once we have finished eating and our conversation has died down we realized we haven't seen our server once after she brought us our entrees.  My friend pays her half of the meal with her CC on the little tablet that sits on the table but I want to pay with cash so I have to wait until our server decides to come back and check on us.  About 5 minutes goes by and she finally comes over to us and I ask for a copy of my receipt because I would like to pay with cash then she looks at me like I have grown a second head.  My bill is $19 and some odd change, I hand her a $20 with my receipt and she says she will be back with my change. ..... ... ..... She brings me $20 in change back. Oh, also our server mentioned that the GM of the restaurant wants to make the menu smaller because it's hard on the waitstaff to remember everything-    note to GM-  HIRE BETTER STAFF.  You shouldn't have to change your restaurant because your staff can't handle their jobs.  I have worked in a multitude of kitchens and it blows my mind EVERY TIME how terrible this place is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
33,Melissa W.,"Thorndale, TX",1,128,2.0,1.0,2017-07-07,First off let me start by saying I haven't to a Chili's in nearly 20 years. Anyways after seeing the Texan cafe was closed we settled on this for lunch. I'll start with service almost non existent. We say our waitress twice in the hour we was there. Food was very slow on delivery. Refilled our sweet tea twice. Tables around seen the same waitress numerous times. My boyfriend had the salad and cheeseburger. It was extremely dry. I had 2 bite cheeseburgers. Also extremely dry. Shared a molten lava cake. Only thing that deserves a mention. Was very good but pricey. I won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
45,Kathleen H.,"Hutto, TX",0,27,,1.0,2017-08-05,Man we were sooo hungry... we sat down sat for like 10 min no one came and asked us for drinks or anything. There was a stand behind us and 3 people standing there. The crisper tasted so weird and where is the chicken?? They were thin prices if breading. The one on limestone is worth the extra miles and time. Service is 3x better. I can not stress the chicken was awful the taste was weird like the sauce was made wrong. I promise this location is a waste of time. But the lime stone is amazing i am an assistant General manager  at a casual dining like this and if i saw any of my crew just walk past a table there wpuld be words and i would know that the table is not helped. We were looking around for 10 min for someone. Servers act like they only can help their table TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK DON'T Y'ALL KNOW THAT SMH SAD PLACE  my babies pizza was burnt and my burger was undercooked. Food safety big thing. But it's ok we won't be back to this location HANDS DOWN WORST LOCATION IN RR/PF/HUTTO AREA,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
32,Kevin M.,"Oceanside, CA",43,37,,3.0,2017-10-30,"I had the ribs, they were pretty lackluster but thats to be expected from a chain restaurant given where we are.  Nothing here stands out and there are plenty of better options unless youre looking for something late, which is how we wound up here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
