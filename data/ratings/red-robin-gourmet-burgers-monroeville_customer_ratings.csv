22,Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,527,597.0,5.0,2013-10-15,"Even though Monroeville Mall has now become a Burger Metropolis, I still prefer Red Robin over Winghart's.  This new Red Robin is in the former Johnny Carino's space. They offer a ton of different burgers and even have turkey and chicken burgers. They also offer salads, ribs, seafood, wraps, soups, chili and a kid's menu. After you have finished off your food you can wash it all down with a pop, root beer float, freckled lemonade, raspberry limeaid, milkshake, malt, beershake, boozyshake, margarita or another cocktail from the bar. Try to save room for dessert as they offer mudd pie, chocolate brownie cake, doubleberry cheesecake and red velvet cake. Be sure to sign up for the Red Robin Royalty Club. It will get you a free burger during your birthday month, every tenth item free (mix and match burgers, salads, sandwiches and entrees.) and all types of other surprises.  Of the two new burger spots now at Monroeville Mall, Red Robin caters more towards families. Winghart's caters more towards adults.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville?start=20,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.8360000000000003
24,Britney C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",173,256,1905.0,3.0,2013-11-23,"This newly placed burger shop is positioned right near main entrance to the mall across from Barnes & Nobles. They have a nice layout with plenty of seating and a some really comfy chairs if you get the cushioned back ones. We sat just inside the entrance about 4 tables in. Its a bad seating choice for the winter since their double doors let in all the cold air from the outside. I was forced to wear my coat there the whole time. Bummer! The hockey game was on so I was fortunate enough to be able to face the TV when we were seated. We ordered right away, I got the beer float which was awesome.  So vanillay and beery but a great combination of both. The orange juice and orange liqueur they added made it taste just like a beer orange-sicle smoothie!!  Our food had its ups and downs. The bottomless sides and flavor of the toppings is very generous but my chicken burger and his angus were quite opposites. I ordered the chicken blue which comes with blue cheese, onion straws, aioli and the standard fixins. He ordered the black n pepper angus with the usual toppings, bacon and cheese. L,T,O. He ordered medium and it came out so juicy and full of flavor. It tasted exactly like what a classic burger would taste like. My chicken burger was good but not great. The chicken was warm and the toppings kinda blended into each other too well that everything was masked over the taste of the blue cheese. I wish I could have tasted the onion straws and aioli sauce better. The service was great, our waitress beverly was always making sure we had whatever we needed. Another downside though is that the servers who brought out the food didn't know which table to send it too. Twice when we were ordering beverly had to pause us to tell the servers which table the food belonged at. Then while we were eating a random women brought food to our table assuming it was ours. Part of me was going to accept it but I declined and told her she had the wrong table. At the conclusion of our evening we decided on dessert which we rarely do. Got some red velvet cake. It came with strawberry sauce but it was very thick. Me and the hubby shared it but after the sauce ran out the cake was way too thick for me to eat.  I'd recommend the mixed drinks and the angus burger. Maybe the turkey but I haven't tried it yet. They have a large selection of burger styles to choose from so you won't be disappointed. And there are plenty of sides. Some are bottomless and others aren't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
15,Carrie W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",165,315,1321.0,3.0,2013-12-09,"I have to say this was a tough review.  I want to start by saying the service there is top notch.  Great job management, they get a 5 out of 5 on that. Very attentive, professional, and curtious staff.  The wait wasn't bad and I very much enjoyed my drink.  The atmosphere is nice.  We sat in the bar.  A decent amount of TVs and the ambiance was delightful.  It was busy so it seemed a little tight in there, but what can you say?  I mean it's Christmas time, on a Saturday afternoon, and this place is basically attached to a mall!   So the reason I gave them a 3 was because my food.  I have to preface this by stating I have been to other locations and thought they made a very tasty cheeseburger and I happen to be a cheeseburger connoisseur.  So I was so looking forward to my burger the Burning love.  I ordered it medium rare, it came with fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa, Pepper-Jack, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll. (yes I copied and pasted that off their menu.)  I got the aioli on the side and added L&O.  When it showed up it looked great, even having a whole charred jalapeno speared at the top of the bun, which I did take a bite of drawing very suspicious looks from my husband... So the burger... It just wasn't there.  I thought the patty itself lacked a lot of flavor.   Really just not that pleasant eating bland meat, so that is definitely no more than a 3 out of 5.  Next the bun.  Ugh it was worse.  I thought I would love it being a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll, but let me say it was heavy, grainy, and the bottom half of the bun was soggy, whether from the grease in the burger or the salsa, I am not certain which one.  The bun is easily a 1 out of 5, I would never get it again.  Not to mention I tasted nothing that would say it was jalapeño infused, and I took the bottom half off and discarded it, eating what I could with just the top part.   The jalapeño coins made no difference whatsoever, simply just added calories to my sandwich, so a 2 out of four.  I will say I thought the aioli sauce was delightful.  I used it on the burger (spread it on per bite) and dipped my husband's sweet potato fries in it, and they were very good.  The sauce is also a 5 out of 5, but unfortunately I didn't go there to eat aioli sauce.   Not sure what when wrong but I was disappointed.  My husband on the other hand ate his burger quicker than it took me to take pictures so his experience was positive.  Well judging from the speed it took him to devour his BBQ Whiskey Burger, he must have enjoyed it.  I will also say I like Red Robin's substitution policies.  I subbed out the fries for a salad with light dressing.  you know that makes sense when you are eating a 800 calorie cheeseburger!  The salad was OK, nothing great nothing bad, a solid 4.   I will go back to Red Robin because I have been to other locations in the past and had a good experience with a very tasty burger.  I will just have to be careful about what I order next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
37,Mary Lou B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",114,62,41.0,2.0,2013-12-24,Good thing I wasn't expecting much. We stopped to get a quick bite after Christmas shopping. We were seated in an area that was absolutely filthy. We asked to be moved.  Only slightly better because I didn't have to step over all the fries and crap on the floor that obviously hadn't been swept.  Got a garden burger. My beloved had the fish and chips. Only so so.  Service was fast.  What were we thinking coming here?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
30,Sarah W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",294,86,173.0,3.0,2014-01-28,"I've been to plenty of Red Robin locations. They have gluten free buns, as well as a dedicated fryer to avoid cross contamination. This is perfect for diners with celiac disease. The French fries are typically coated with a seasoned salt that is not gluten free, so be sure to tell your server you want your entire meal to be gluten free to avoid symptoms.  The last three or four times I ate at a Red Robin my server typically goes AWOL, especially when I seem to need something. A server once spent 5 minutes telling me about her morning, that included watching her cat take it's last breath.  Food wise, everything is consistent! Also, if you like tomato lettuce and mayo on your burger, be sure to ask for them as you order because your server might not check up on you after the food is dropped. Today I ordered a chocolate milkshake, and without asking, the server charged me for a ""monster"" $4.99 shake that includes refills instead of giving me a regular size shake, which is all I wanted. My burger was free because it's my birthday month. Will I continue to come back? Yes, but when Burgatory opens in the waterfront I'll probably never see the inside of Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

16,Chuck W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3491,98,790.0,3.0,2014-07-12,"Red Robin Burgers Monroeville is at the Monroeville Mall front entrance in front of Monterey Bay and across from Barns and Noble. The have been there a year or two now replacing what was Johnny Carino's.  This location perhaps like most, is backed up on the weekend evenings, so I usually try to go on weekday evenings and sit in the bar area at a high-top. You could go on the weekend and not to worry too much because they register your cell phone number and send you a text when you are up. This is nice because you can walk across to the book store and browse while you wait. It's a great book store well worth browsing the racks for a half hour. Then before you know it you get that text message that your table is ready.  The place is new and still really clean. The service is pretty good most of the time; although it can vary depending on how new the server is to the job.  There are plenty of kids here and they have a great kids menu which is part of what makes a great family place, hence my option to usually dine in the bar side. If you have children I know you and they will have a great time at Red Robin. I like several of their signature burgers namely the Guacamole Bacon, the Sautéed 'Shroom and the good old Bacon Cheeseburger. You can also 'have it your way and choose all your topping sauces and ingredients which is fun sometimes. The burgers are all quite good. I wish I could order the temperature I wanted but their choices are 'pink or no pink'. I ask for pink, which usually comes out without pink. Don't know if they are avoiding any possible food borne illness which could hurt the chain, but that is my guess. Nonetheless the burgers do retain their juiciness and flavor, so while I may not leave uttering the signature Yummm, I am certainly satisfied enough to keep coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
39,Amanda T.,"Monroeville, PA",0,4,,3.0,2014-08-09,"There last night. I thought the service was poor as a whole.  Our server was ok, but we noticed drinks at the bar just sitting there waiting on the servers to pick them up.

11,Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650.0,3.0,2015-01-18,"Let me first say that I'm a fan of Red Robin.  For a chain, the food is decent and service is usually stellar.  However, this particular location on the particular day we visited did not live up to what I was expecting. We arrived after the lunch rush and before the dinner rush, but we still had to wait.  What was really odd about this is that there were numerous tables empty throughout the place, but everyone that came in was told there was going to be at least a ten minute wait.  Ok, whatever, maybe there was an underlying reason for this, but when the line starts backing up to the point that people are walking right back out, that's not a good sign.  When my party was finally called, they tried to fit five full grown adults into a single booth.  I excused myself to use the facilities and when I came back I noticed my party had moved to a roomier circular table. To say that things started to go downhill at this point is somewhat an understatement.  Our server, I'm sorry I don't remember your name, was less than enthused to be working.  He had the personality of wet paper bag.  So monotone that it was almost impossible to hear him over the music, television or other patrons.  Hardly made eye contact and had a very flat affect.  Once our drink and appetizer orders were in, we didn't see him for a while.  A while in here turns out that we don't see him again until the appetizers are ready.  Our drinks followed shortly after.  We placed our orders for our burgers and it's like the grade of the hill we were sliding down increased a whole hell of a lot.   Typically when you order a burger here they will ask ""pink or no pink.""  I, along with several other people in my party, ordered our burgers with no pink.  When the burgers arrived what we got was no pink, but it was more like charred black.  Each bite of the burger you could taste how burnt it was.  We had asked our server before he disappeared again for some mustard and extra napkins.  How long did it take for him to return with those items, just under fifteen minutes.  During those minutes, I watched him stand within plain sight of our table, not doing anything (honestly dude, if you hate the job that much, look elsewhere for employment).   Then when it came time to pay, it took forever.  I opted not to get another drink, but should of, that's how long it took.  The smoothest part of this whole operation was walking out the front door to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

The decor in main dining room is uninspired. I like the bar area better.  So we like the clam chowder and you can substitute/ upgrade a side to this. The fish and chips are worth a return trip. The service is on the slow side. We watched our food sit under the heat lamp for a few minutes :( For a slow night, they were super slow!!!! I counted 17 patrons. Don't know what took so long.  We talked to the waitress and manager. A check adjustment. In all fairness, I don't think it was a waitress problem, she seemed quite capable.

From calling on the phone, to find out if the outdoor seating was open, to entering the restaurant we were greeted with enthusiasm and a smile that made us feel so welcomed. The new menu is incredible, with many different cheese features and a new burger that is a must try it with macaroni and cheese on it. The host was especially accommodating and sweet as he greeted us with a huge smile. The server, Liz, was fast attentive, and had a wonderful personality.

They advertise a chicken brushetta sandwich but it's just a burger with the tomatoes cut up.  I was very disappointed and expected something more.  My husband ordered his usual Schroom burger with Provolone cheese.   When it came out it was absolutely drenched in grease.  I understand a certain amount of grease is expected being a burger and all but the whole bottom of his bun was just soaked.  It was disgusting.  He ate it not being one to complain but he felt sick after.  We will most likely not be returning to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
3,Matt N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",57,108,265.0,4.0,2016-09-20,"My wife and our kids went to Red Robin around 8pm on a Saturday night after swimming for most of the day.  We were tired and very hungry.  I like to bring the kids here because they are usually entertained by the activities at the table that are there for them.  They usually color something, read, watch television, or worse case I'll bring out the Ipad!      This night there were a lot of kids here because there was a soccer tournament in town.  So we had to wait a little bit but not too long.  I really like their kid's menus here.  Even my daughter eats here and she is so picky!  It's good for kids and it's loud so I don't have to tell them to talk more softly.        For me and the wife the food was ok.  My wife loves burgers but they never get it right for her here.  I always get the Whiskey BBQ and I really like that burger.  No complaints.  What I didn't like was my bottomless sweet potatoes fries.  I got a few orders of fries but they were like the bottom of the basket fries.  They always come like this so I don't think that I'm just getting unlucky either.  I had to start stealing my kid's fries!  My wife did like her bottomless salad.  That helped but overall I say we come here more for the kids than for a gourmet burger for ourselves.        They do always have good beer on tap here so that is always a plus.  Service is usually ok nothing too bad.  Just watch playing those electronic games at your table because they will charge you!  The devices on the tablr now show you the menu, your bill, and you can pay from there too.  It is neat.  I would give this Red Robin a 3 if it was just my wife and I out for the night but I will give them a 4 just because it's a good place to take our kids and still have an enjoyable dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
14,Megan C.,"Elizabeth, PA",0,11,,1.0,2016-09-23,"The food is usually decent but, the last time we went we didn't even get to order.  We waited 30 minutes for our waitress to come and take our drink order.  After 30 minutes my husband and I left because we gave her ample time to serve us and she did not follow through.  You shouldn't have to leave an establishment because the waitress is unwilling to do her job. On a separate occasion, the first time we had her as a waitress she took my phone with her to look at a coupon.  Then, I saw her hand my phone to another customer!  I had to shout across the restaurant, ""That's my phone!!!""  I honestly should have never let her take it from me in the first place, my mistake.   Until this particular waitress finds another line of work, we will not be returning to the Monroeville location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

It's busy and the staff is usually running around a good bit to keep up, but they do seem to keep up. The food is good, albeit a bit formulaic. The restaurant itself is clean. My son really favors the grilled chicken on a stick. I like trying one of their burgers, cause they are decent and there are plenty of choices. Good place for the family, good place with friends.

We sat @ the bar & I got fed up & told my husband to get it to go! There wasn't enough help obviously! Had a nicer experience @ home on our porch watching the sunset than watching the slow help! Food is great like the Cabo Avo salad! But the service here needs to step up to the PLATE!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
1,Tiffany Y.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,553,,2.0,2017-07-22,"Burgers - 4 stars - The beef was cooked to our liking and had tasty toppings. Poutine fries - 2 stars - The cheese should be melted throughout rather than be fried balls. Waitress - 2 stars - We had to wave her over several times, for example, when we had no forks or napkins. She was nice. Price/value - 2 stars - We spent $50 for two people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

0,Mike B.,"Latrobe, PA",10,46,1.0,5.0,2017-11-16,"Love this place! The turkey burger is amazing and it looks like a turkey breast and not a turkey burger that you see in the store....it's so tasty and juicy that it's making my mouth water as I write this...I usually order the bacon cheeseburger and substitute the turkey burger and I'm never disappointed the toppings are fresh and the fries wow crispy, seasoned and golden brown just like the way I like an order of bottomless fries...wish I would have started going here sooner...I've had the burgers and they are flavorful and seasoned with a delicious seasoning that they provide and the buns are so fresh that they melt in your mouth...I also love the camp fire bbq sauce it's out of this world especially when you dip your fries in it or even order it on the burger...I suggest you get a burger here because you can't go wrong especially when it's their specialty!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
8,Tayler P.,"Irwin, PA",122,1,,1.0,2017-11-29,"Literally when I say this is the worst Red Robin I have ever been to, I mean it. Now my friends & I live far away from Red Robin so when one is in sight, you best know we are going to eat at one. Well, when we got to this Red Robin the place wasn't busy at all and had so many open tables so we got excited that there wouldn't be a wait, as we were going to go shopping after. We did not see anybody at the host stand for a good ten minutes until it what it looked like the manager came and told us that it would be a 10-15 minute wait.. with how many tables open we didn't understand why there was a wait. As more people came in, the wait got longer, and more than 15 minutes had gone by. Finally, we were seated about 25 minutes later and we were very ""hangry"". Our waitress came took our orders - to sum it up we waited 10 minutes to even get our waters, there was 3 servers total on the floor, and the service was just about awful. Even to mention there was some kind of unknown goo in my friends campfire sauce and we she asked for another one, THE MANAGER brought another one with the same goo in it. So gross. In conclusion; giving this place a 1 star only because I love bottomless fries and they were about the only thing good about this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
5,Jackie D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-08,"Was hoping to stop in for lunch on Friday--there was a short ten minute wait. Restaurant & bar area were mostly empty but waiting room was busy... so my dad went to wait by the bar area until our table was called--hostess and waitress rudely told me I needed to go tell my dad he couldn't wait in the empty bar area until our table was ready. I clearly explained he just wanted to sit and wait and the waitress became even more rude. It is still unclear why my dad couldn't sit down in bar area and wait... especially when no waiting room seats were open (we didn't expect to be served yet).

Our experience today was awful. Hostess seated us at a dirty table. Server came, she was very nice. Drinks and Apps were fine, BUT, we had no silverware....we ordered  dinner.....I just got a bacon cheeseburger and OVER EMPHASIZED well well well done.....burnt........as I always do.......Dinners arrived......I picked up burger, bun was DRENCHED in grease......just a wet, soggy, terrible mess......stuff just dripping off it.....I squeezed the burger......BLOOD RED......blood and grease just ooooozed from it......it was a total disgusting mess.....the bottom of bun was literally soaked and falling apart......saturated with BLOOD and grease.....I quickly returned it to server and owing to my policy on such things......asked it be removed from bill and I did not seek a replacement dinner.......I have a long history in food service and WILL NOT EVER return anything to be re-cooked, replaced, etc......I have seen toooooooo much in the places I've worked......so I order very specific.....(burnt) and the place gets one shot at getting it right or I leave hungry.......NO exceptions......ever.....my hubby didnt really like his dinner, saying it was just 'eh ok'......there was no ketchup on the table for fries.....we asked and got it......my mom didn't like her dinner at all saying it was 'unedible'.....we paid the bill and left......Manager did come to apologize, citing a new crew in back, he was nice....but this was our last visit. Terrible. Horrible. Disgusting. Place is obviously a gamble......great once, disaster next time, etc etc etc.......we are too busy to take chances......we'll never return to this place.  Just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroeville,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
