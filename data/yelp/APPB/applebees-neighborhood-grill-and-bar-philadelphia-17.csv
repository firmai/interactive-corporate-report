Vona W.,"Chambersburg, Trenton, NJ",8,22,23,4.0,7/20/2017,"First of all, our waiter, Kel, he's the best waiter we've ever had. He is everything you would want in a waiter - friendly, nice, attentive, well informed, funny and laid back. We will go back just because of him! He's amazing! The food was good, filled with flavor and a good portion.  I would had gave 5 stars based off of that. But when we first walked in, the girl seating people didn't say anything. She proceeded to seat us in the bar area, which was loud and we kindly asked her if we could be seated away from the music and the bar. She gave an attitude and walked towards the stand, we walked a little further than her and she was like, ""where are you going!?"".. I kindly thanked her for seating us elsewhere and she just walked away with an attitude. If you have mostly empty seating on the other side (the quiet side) why would you try to seat us in the noisy bar side? Anyway, when we were waiting for our food she would walk past seating others and giving us dirty looks. Seriously, I wish I would have gotten her name but she is extremely unprofessional and very rude. Kel saved this particular restaurant from receiving 1 star from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17
Isabella L.,"Burlington, VT",190,99,20,4.0,6/29/2017,"I love this apples bees! I have noticed that they seem to be more on top of there game when it is during the evening (thing end of dinner and after dinner crowd) and things are packed, than during the day when things are slower. Not sure why that is, but its true. The staff here is friendly, and love to make conversation with you. The food is up to applebee's standard and the bar is always packed out. I have yet to have an unpleasant experience here, and we've been eating here over the course of four years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17
Michael C.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,47,19,3.0,10/16/2017,"The service and wait time is usually pretty decent, I've been there a few times now for food and drinks.  It's not the cleanest Applebee's I've been to and the servers let people get a little bit too drunk sometimes, hence the 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17
Jessica L.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,62,90,2.0,2/19/2017,"I went today to enjoy a nice dinner with my significant other. First off, the servers looked like they hated being there. At least one of the servers which I recall, Megan, gave better service than those who came with our food and served it to our table with a bitter face and left our table. The appetizers came out at different times and so we waited until all our appetizers came out so we can chow down without feeling bad for each other. My entree was a 6oz steak with mashed potatoes and garlicky green beans. It was overall good except the green beans were bland and somewhat watery. My boyfriend got an 8oz steak with mashed potatoes and fries. It looked as if they gave him a 6oz steak and a leftover piece of steak they had from a previous order because it was burnt as hell and so he did not finish it at all. Then the check came and it seems as if our server put in our order wrong just by a mere dollar but we let it slide and paid for it to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17
Jasmyne G.,"Philadelphia, PA",97,26,5,4.0,8/13/2017,"They have nice specials. I love their Peach Sangria! Food is decent, and they're usually pretty quick when I come on my lunch break and sit at the bar. Only complaint would be off-putting bar tenders. I work in customer service myself, and understand having a bad day, but you'd think having your salary based off tips would make you crack a smile once in awhile instead of looking annoyed by everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17
Fredrick P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,,1.0,6/26/2017,"I went to the apple bees in this location and it was an unpleasant experience, The tables i arrived at were dirty, when i ordered i got a salad and the 2 for 20 meal for me and my uncle when the food arrived my soda tasted like windex and my uncles rice on his plate was like eating plastic pellets it was clearly overcooked. I will definitely not be returning to this Applebee's anytime soon. Thank you for reading my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17

Jackie P.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,15,17,1.0,1/26/2017,Sitting here as we speak. Seated fairly quickly. Took the waitress over 10 minutes to come greet us another 10 before she came back to take our order. My pasta tasted like water and my husbands chicken was burnt. She came about 15 minutes after the food came out to refill our drinks and we waited almost 20 minutes before she even came for the check. Beyond ridiculous. Felt bad for the table behind us because she spilled their drinks on their laps. Beyond horrible service. 10 minutes later and we're still waiting for her to bring back our credit card.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17
J A.,"Darby, PA",35,3,1,1.0,12/6/2016,Ordered 4 cheese mac and cheese with chicken fingers to go and it was HORRIBLE. There was sugar in the MAC and cheese and the chicken fingers were more like nuggets,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17
RevRun R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,9/23/2016,"Visited this Applebee's with my wife all set to order our usual order of spinach and artichoke dip, double crunched wings, with a side of chicken breast and white rice, when we were greeted by the unpleasant and arrogant manager, Amante Nuualiitia. He says ""every other Applebee's has it wrong and he has it right."" You can't order that. Even after telling him that we order the same thing at Applebee's all over the east coast and that the menu says opposite, he shrugged his shoulders. Then I asked for the general manager's name and he said ""it's on the side of the building."" Needless to say ""we won't be back here.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17

Letitia B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,1,1.0,4/4/2016,"I'd say this place gave me the worst service ever, but if be lying because I actually didn't get served at all. 25 minutes sitting at a table in a half empty restaurant at 8pm on a Monday and I got nothing. Not a hello, a drink, acknowledgment... A manager walked by and a server from another section about six times and not a peep... My boyfriend and I eventually left our complaints with the hostess and walked out... Took a ride to the cherry hill location and was seated, ate and paid in 40 minutes.

Bill M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,12,,2.0,8/24/2014,There is certainly a difference between going inside and carside To Go. If you head there will low expectations then you'll be fine.  i've had 3 bad experiences ordering from carside. usually I pull up and wait 5 to 10 minutes for someone to come out to the car to acknowledge me.  One time I actually went inside I waited so long. The food is inconsistent. I've had very good food and on the same menu item overcooked or soggy veggies.  It is good that they align with Weight Watchers points and have some diet-friendly items to choose from. But that is no different from the national chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17

The waitress suggested a drink the yummi gummy martini and it was entirely too sweet. And I much as I am a fan of good customer service, she was obnoxious. Sorry, but I don't like to be hovered over or interrupted every 5 minutes.

Lakara B.,"Philadelphia, PA",118,109,4,5.0,6/8/2009,"What can I really say about Applebee's... I'm a fan (some employees at the Center City location know me by name *shrug*), so a good review is not hard to get out of me. They sent my annual ""Happy Birthday, Free Food For You,"" voucher last week, so Thursday morning, after a particularly sloshed birthday celebration, my brother, my sister, and I took our hungover tooshies to get some grub. We split an order of boneless buffalo wings, then I went for the chicken fajitas, brother had the chicken penne, and sister had the A-1 Realburger. I was hesitant to taste the penne after the experience I had at Chammps, but, o.m.g. it was good. Everything else was just perfect, as always, but next time, I'm going for the chicken penne. Side notes:  1- I am so weak over those Realburger commercials. (They make me want to run screaming up 15th Street and demand as much beef as they can give me as fast as I can shove it into my big, fat mouth.) 2 - A tad annoying that my voucher always specifies the Aramingo location, when 15th Street is within walking distance, but, oh well.  3-  I think the hiring manager must be a woman, cuz those men/boys in there are BEE-YOO-TEE-FUL. And our waiter was a doll. Wanted to take him home with me. So sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20

Luis Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,22,,2.0,2/6/2012,"I always considered Applebees as an average place. The food is ho-hum nothing special. At times i wonder how long has that food been sitting there. I believe a lot of food is pre-cooked earlier that day, then microwaved and served. I think the Burgers are cooked fresh though. Just fyi, to any of the previous posters or whomever reads this review. This Applebees on Castor is the training/eval center. I havent really had a problem with the actual service here. Its just the food isnt the best. This goes for all Applebees although im sure some are better than others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20
Tyhee B.,"Bristol, PA",19,12,,4.0,6/13/2009,"My girlfriend and I went there after prom, and I have to say that once again Applebees has satisfied my appetite to it's fullest extent. I am a guy who loves meats. Steak, burgers, or chicken. Applebees makes a flawless effort to deem all of these foods irresistible. The seafood is amazing, and I wanted to make the appetizers the main course, they were so good. I did have to wait a while for the food, but I'd say the wait is worth it. I even loved their strawberry lemonade. I guess the only problem with the store is the wait, so please don't go there if you're expecting ""fast"" food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20
Jim M.,"Philadelphia, PA",83,324,,1.0,9/15/2008,"So I decided to write this review so you won't think that the last reviewer was a lone wingnut in a sea of contented patrons. I've been here three times. The first time the service and the food was ok. The second time the service was very slow, though the food was ok, so I chalked it up to a busy night. The third time, I came on a Sunday night, starving. I was seated across from a couple near a window. I saw them get their food. The gentleman across from me started mumbling something and making a face. He got a server/manager and complained about large particles of dirt in his salad. The server rushed off to fix whatever was wrong with that guys salad. Meanwhile I""m sitting there waiting, hungry, smelling all the food of everyone else. After at least 5-10 minutes of waiting, I decide to start the clock. My rule of thumb is, if they seat you and don't say anything/don't take an order within 5 minutes, its time to walk out. Sure enough, 6 minutes pass, no service. Not one person that even came by and said ""Hey sorry, we've been slammed. Can you hold on a minute and I'll take your order"". No one offered to get me even water. Finally I walked out pissed. As I reached the door, the person in charge of seating says ""Leaving already? I said yes, no one gave me any service. Then and ONLY then did someone offer to take my order"". At that point I was so pissed I just left. Instead I went to a nearby Subway. The owner of that establishment was grateful for my business and processed my order in a timely fashion. And I didn't have to tip for crappy service. Never again. Avoid like the plague.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-17?start=20

I actually got mozzillara sticks, boneless honey bbq wings and the fried dymantic shrimp. I thought the food was good and it was nice and warm & plus the best part of the night was getting the dessert and of course the drink which was a Mucho Strawberry Mango Rita :)  The 5 of us had the triple meltdown chocolate cake and it was awesome!
