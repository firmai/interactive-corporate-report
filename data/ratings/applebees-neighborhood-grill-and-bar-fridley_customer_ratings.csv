One thing I can say about Applebees is that they are remarkably consistent everywhere you go, whenever you happen to go there.  I've never had a bad experience at any of their locations, anywhere in the U.S. My only negative comment from yesterday is that the artichoke, spinach, cheese dip sucks!  Try as I might, the only spec of artichoke I could find anywhere, swimming in cheese, was a small leaf about the size of my fingernail. I don't seek out Applebees but I have no problem going there if someone wants to invite me.  Next time, I'll skip the dip though. -Daddy Maxx Retro",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,

5,Stephen H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,2015-11-07,"I don't think I'm much of a complainer or even possess very high expectations, however, it has been a long time since I received such poor service. I'm currently sitting at the bar after finishing my one beer, my water (which I requested), and my plate is now moved to the side after I placed it there. It has been this way for roughly 20-30mins.  I was excited to come in to try the bottomless fries with the burger (fries are my favorite). I sat down about 5 before 9pm. The bar and most of the restaurant was very slow. About 3-4 mins after sitting down the bartender came over and asked, ""What do you want to drink?""  No name, no ""Hello"", no ""How's it going?""...nothing except for ""What do you want to drink?"". Went through the process of ordering my drinks, and subsequently food, with the same demeanor of short answers and having to request everything from information to a fry refill. The fry refill took 15mins in itself to come out and only after I asked how long they normally took to come out. She went to the kitchen and within seconds came back out with a bowl of fries. The entire meal I had no drink refill even though my glass stayed empty for the majority of the time.  I think the thing that ultimately pissed me off and took the bartender's tip from my normal 20% or more to 0% was her consistently standing at the other end of the bar with a guy she was apparently on a Tinder date with based on what she was saying to the other customers at that end of the bar.  The food was delicious, the hostess was gracious, the service at the bar was abismal. As I just received my check, the bartender in question is named Aleasha. She single handedly made it to where I will never revisit this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,
8,G B.,"Minneapolis, MN",17,15,,3.0,2016-01-03,"We usually only do Applebee's after Christmas because my brother and sister-in-law have an obsession with giving us gift cards there.  The last time we were at this location was probably NYE of about 2011.  I slipped on refreeze going out to my car, and because I was still icing and taking ibuprofen for my knee, I reported it about a week after the fact.  Never sought out medical attention, but the corporate person I spoke to made me feel like a real idiot with questions like ""Didn't you know that this is Minnesota and there is ice here in the winter time?""   Anyway, this visit.  I have an issue with cilantro (which seems to land in about 90% of their dishes and one of their waitresses once asked me if I was allergic when I said something) but I like their wings, so I usually don't make it past the appetizer menu.  No exception, but I found a new fave:  The sweet potato fries. Oh.. yummy.  My son (age 8) ordered a chicken quesadilla.  No mention on the menu of pico de gallo, which I think was in it... didn't look real closely, but I agree with the kid.  Chicken quesadilla is a shell, cheese, and chicken.  Had no issues getting it remade, so we're good there.  There were too many employees standing around when they could've been filling our drinks and taking our gift cards.  My broken-footed body went to the restroom, used it, and came back, and the gift cards were still sitting where I left them.   I give them ""better than usual"" on this visit.  Still not planning to go on my own dime any time soon, but they're winning me back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,
6,Erik S.,"Saint Paul, MN",1,5,1.0,2.0,2016-02-21,"Food was great!  Service was horrible.  No refills, no plates for our appetizers.  I would understand if they had been busy, but three other tables besides ours.  The waiter never checked up on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,
3,Andrea A.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,7,,1.0,2017-02-12,"Did an order for pick up last night.  Now I understand it was a Saturday and they were busy and all but give accurate times.  When I called in the order I was told 11 minutes.   I got there right on time and then waited for 25 minutes for my food, which I finally had to walk in and ask for either my food or money back.  If you knew you were busy why not say it will be 30 minutes instead of 11?  Then people won't be sitting there waiting.  There was another car out there that sat also the as long as me.  For the inconvenience they put a coupon in my bag for a free order of Mozzarella sticks... which expired on January 15th.....nice, real nice.   I would never do car side to go from this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,
4,Caroline L.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,7,,5.0,2017-06-01,No other Fridley restaurant can compare. There is something for everyone! Great place to meet up with friends cozy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,
2,j c.,"North Hollywood, CA",116,3,,1.0,2017-06-12,"4:00pm on a Monday. As a local in the neighborhood I have had the non-pleasure of  attempting to enjoy a meal here three times. If you have zero expectation for customer service this is your restaurant. If you love to walk into a dining establishment and be ignored and stand without a greeting this is your jam. If you love employees walking around in a stupefying daze without addressing, assessing their customers' needs man this spot is lit. Bar rescue for poorly managed franchise establishments?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,
1,Yande M.,"Minneapolis, MN",116,19,19.0,2.0,2017-09-25,"Service was slow but friendly. The quality of food really wasn't too fantastic. Bar tender was in training and was rather slow, but that's expected of course. Came here because there weren't many other options. Would not come here again, honestly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fridley,,,,,
