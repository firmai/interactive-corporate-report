22,James N.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",19,30,11.0,1.0,2012-03-05,"I used to love Chili's, especially their mushroom jack fajitas. Recently though, I have been very disappointed with their service. In the last few times I have gone, the service has been poor overall and the food has been lack-luster. The last time I went though, I was driven away for the last time. When we were waiting on our food, I noticed that there was a dead cockroach on the window sill right next to our table. After pointing this out to a staff person (either a manger or host, they never said), they picked it up with their fingers, dropped it, picked it up again and walked away. There was never a word said to us, never an apology rendered, never a mention of the incident at all. I even took the internet survey to let them know and they never got back to me. After that, I started looking closer and every table was dirty, there a dozen or more other bugs on window sills around me, and everything was sticky. I was disappointed not only with the condition of the restaurant, as it was not busy and someone could have definitely cleaned up, but also with the lack of response of the staff to my complaint. I hope that things will change, but I will not be going back and neither will anyone that I know that I have talked to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa?start=40,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

You can tell its a frozen burger patty before they cook it. Chips and queso were good, but the whole reason I go to Chili's is the chips and salsa and margaritas. Deelicious!

The food at chili's has never been great but this experience will be our last one with them.  We took my son to the New Tampa chili's for his birthday at his request.  We arrived early (before 6:00pm) in order to eat and see an 8:00pm movie. It took over an hour for our food to arrive an when it did, everything was over cooked and dry. We mentioned it to our server and she completely ignored the situation. I finally stopped our waitress after watching my husband chicken down the swill they served us and asked her to redo his meal.  At this point, we were running late, my husband was disgusted, and we were over the whole experience.

We decided to stop in on a Wednesday night and sit at a booth in the bar area. They have these cool touchscreens you can use to order (great in theory, poorly executed in practice) but ours was broken. We waited awhile for service and ordered the Presidente Margarita and one of their new Watermelon Vodka Coolers. YUCK! So overly sugary and barely any alcohol and not on the 2 for 1 special so therefore overpriced. We ordered guacamole for our chips, which came out the same time as our meal. I got the chicken fajitas and they were bland and lacking that special something. I was seriously disappointed. Our service wasn't great, and we ended up figuring out how to pay with the touchscreen which was the only saving grace.

12,Diane G.,"Tampa, FL",117,291,115.0,3.0,2014-09-19,"I have mixed feelings about this place, but my son loves coming here and we always enjoy our time together. Our servers are always friendly and attentive, and the food is pretty typical for a chain restaurant. Our servers usually remember us (especially my son), and they go out of their way to entertain and please him, which always makes mom happy. I would not recommend deviating from the menu in any way, because you can never tell what that is going to cost you. The recent addition of the table tablet/kiosk is nice, although not fully functional for ordering. My son and I use it to play virtual boggle, which for 99 cents (added to your bill) is extremely reasonable for an hour or more of laughing, playing, and bonding with your child. I do love their chips and salsa, probably my favorite chips (I wish they'd revise their salsa and make it chunkier, more flavorful, and less tomato saucey)....they are complimentary when you sit in the bar in area (we usually get a high top table, no waiting if there is space). We don't normally order full meals...we usually only get the chips and salsa, me a few glasses of wine, and he a dessert. He loves the giant skillet chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and the chocolate lava cake...they are big enough for 3 people. When we do order food, he loves the grilled cheese and I am partial to the spicy shrimp tacos and the pork carnitas fajitas (although I don't  believe the later is in the menu anymore).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997

After almost a year, I figured I'd give it another try. That was my mistake. I was in a party of two. There was no line at the door so we walked in and sat on the bar side, after being greeted by a rather confused hostess. It took a long time for our waitress to take our drink orders. We ordered our appetizer which came with barely any sauce. There were two other parties that sat down after us but got their food first. When our food came out my fajitas were colder than normal. Usually they would be smoking which I was able to compare to the person's order to the table beside us.

I was brave enough to come back but since the macaroni grill closed at night this place is so dark and hard to find.

We then find a table at the bar wait 10 minutes no one takes our order. We then find the skinny hostess again and ask her if we can get a booth she says no. No manager to be found. We were served finally; then we came in the previous weekend on a Saturday and it was busy I went to the restroom and could not believe hot filthy the kitchen was french fries all over the floor.

When i ordered a molten ($7) i was told they were out so I got 2 mini moltens instead($5) but still paid full price for the item. The waitress never came back so I couldnt tell her to change the check. So mediocre. Not the best chilis out there, but it will do. Nothing horrible honestly. I had a very friendly waitress though, I wouldnt put the blame on their service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
6,David B.,"Valrico, FL",36,33,10.0,4.0,2017-05-30,Chili's is a greatly underrated and sometimes overlooked restaurant chain. With the never frozen burger patties and great chips and guacamole.. What's not to like? Sure it can be a little slow at times but why not enjoy your company and relax. The management at this location is exceptional! Thank you Tawnya for another great meal!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
8,Debbie K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,9,,4.0,2017-07-10,Went there and we both ordered the combo steak and shrimp fajitas.  They were quite good and hit the spot.  Had not been to Chili's in awhile and noticed they revamped the menu.  Service was good and the place was pleasantly unpacked at 2:00 to 3:00 pm on a Sunday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

7,Ann L.,"Tampa, FL",22,1,14.0,4.0,2017-08-21,"New Tampa has the best Chili's by far. The staff are friendly & helpful. The variety on the menu makes it where we pop in once or twice a week. We love to take something sweet home for later. Sometimes we even order chips& salsa to go because theirs beats what we can get at the grocery store. We really appreciate the email specials, Plenti and being able to check ourselves out at the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
3,Samantha D.,"Tampa, FL",92,143,41.0,4.0,2017-08-25,Update...we continue to be regulars.  Service is stable.  We still have some favorites like the Margarita chicken which is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
4,Heather E.,"Wauseon, OH",1,7,,1.0,2017-09-04,"Walked in to Chili's hoping for a great lunch with margaritas, all to sit in a booth for an hour with no drinks and no silverware even after putting in an order. Multiple servers walked past our table and did not stop to check in, but continued to check in with the table directly behind. Only come here if you have a hobby of sitting in booths and server watching while looking at pictures of food you'll never get to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
5,Elizabeth C.,"Temple Terrace, FL",3,1,,5.0,2017-09-23,Go every weekend and the server Charlotte is the best. Foods always great. Well 99% of the time. Sometimes they must have a new cook and Boo.
