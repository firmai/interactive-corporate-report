Patricia K.,"Chicago, IL",161,391,24,5.0,7/23/2008,"I made a return visit a couple weeks ago and was very delighted with the service.  Our server was incredibly personable and when we had a botched drink order, she quickly corrected it.  She was also very helpful to my grandmother, who had a hard time reading through the menu and making her selection.  She answered each one of her questions and offered some of her own suggestions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=60
Laura O.,"Tinley Park, IL",20,92,,5.0,7/20/2008,"One of my favorites.  This place offers menu items that no one else has.  No matter what you order, you are almost guaranteed it will taste good.  A good place to ""try something different.""  Good portions.  Good food.  Good service.  Good specialty drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=60
Dakota B.,"Mokena, IL",1,66,,2.0,7/28/2009,"These people cannot get carryout orders correct for the life of them.  From totally incorrect orders to missing condiments to lacking all utensils they have managed to make these errors and them some. I once ordered two burgers and walked out with a pasta dish and PLATE of lemons. Not a cup or a small bowl, a PLATE of lemon wedges.  Steamed over lemon wedges at that. Hence the reason I made it allll the way home with it. I have no idea what or who or.... Anyways Can't speak on dining in, carryout WAS my thing. Pretty much done with them. If you do carryout inventory EVERYTHING as in count utensils, open the containers and taste all sauces!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=60
Carlyse O.,"Park Forest, IL",85,34,9,3.0,8/12/2017,"I  visited this location today with my cousins to have lunch after a movie. We ordered our drinks and waited patiently for our food. Me and one of my cousins ordered the endless apps, which were great. Another cousin of mine is vegan, meaning she does not eat cheese or dairy products in addition to not eating meat. She ordered the black bean burger on the gluten-free bread with no cheese and no sauce. The first time her Burger came out it was a regular burger with cheese on it on the gluten-free bread. The waiter took it away and returned with a new burger that was a black bean burger placed on the Original Burgers bun with all the toppings including melted cheese on the top of the bread. We then spoke to a manager who made sure her meal was correct finally. It was very disappointing that they lazily tried to replace the Patty  on the burger instead of making her a whole new order. The waiter was very accommodating and the manager comped her meal. It still may be a while before either of us go to the TGIFriday location again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park
Mike M.,"Oak Forest, IL",91,9,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Went in on a Wednesday at 7:15 to a mostly empty restaurant.  Was told it was a 10-15 minute wait.  We waited the 15 minutes and still nothing, so we left.  I understand if they were short staffed, but there were more empty tables then filled.  It's no wonder why the casual restaurant and Fridays in general are dying.  Management can't put together enough staff to run a Wednesday night, what makes me want to go there on a weekend?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park
Kg M.,"Joliet, IL",0,30,,1.0,11/23/2017,Oh my goodness...I will never return to this location. I went on thanksgiving which was a huge mistake on my part. Food took an hour but thats to be expected because they were understaffed. My food was missing items(bacon) I was given about 15 fries. I am not the type to complain and send food back because I don't want the yelp special* My S.O's dish was incorrect too. Nobody was offered refills. I understand that they were understaffed but they dropped the ball in every way possible. I think I am done with TGIF as a company to be honest.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park
Ava W.,"Tinley Park, IL",6,14,33,1.0,7/22/2017,"First time in my life I didn't give a tip.  I came during the week at a very slow time not many people in the restaurant.  It was four of us and we were seated immediately.  During the course of our meal no one came to refresh our drink or remove all the plates, napkins and garbage that had accumulated at our table. At the end of the meal I asked the waitress why wasn't our table cleaned she stated we don't clean your table until you leave.

Jill H.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,13,,1.0,9/23/2017,Had two horrible carry out experiences with this restaurant.  The second time was the last straw. The person taking the order didn't know the questions to ask and messed everything up. When my husband went to get the food it was wrong and the bartender had an attitude about it.  My bruschetta pasta had clearly been sitting for at least an hour because the sauce was dried and grainy and my husband's steak was raw and cold in the center. The steak had to be remade three times and aside from picking up the food we had to go back to get corrected food. The manager was not helpful and was very condescending. I said I wanted my money back and she said she couldn't. I'm still waiting for general manager to call me back as the steak is definitely a health department issue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park
Mani S.,"Chicago, IL",226,10,1,1.0,5/18/2017,Extremely poor service.  My friend's and I came during a very slow hour.  We were given a menu and then later told it was only for the bar. We asked to move to the bar area. No one came to help move the table. We had to move all items on our table to the bar area ourself.  Then we waited 20 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge us only to find our precious server didn't put our order in.

Tanya H.,"Bedford Park, IL",0,1,2,1.0,8/4/2017,"disappointing meal, and the service took forever. We had a group of about 17, which I could understand taking a little extra time, but it took about 35 minutes from the time we ordered until the time we got our food. Most of it you could tell was sitting for a while, and wasn't as hot as the food should've been. We saw the manager go to a few other tables, but it seemed like she was avoiding us since she probably knew how terrible our service was. Also they stuck our group back by the washrooms, with the tables that have half booths and half chairs, and they pushed the tables all the way against the wall, so the first person to sit down on the booth side had to scoot all the way against the wall and couldn't get up to go to the washroom without asking the 7 other people next to her to scoot back out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park

Anne R.,"Mokena, IL",0,17,9,2.0,9/22/2017,"Oh, Boy!  You know what you're gonna get at Friday's.  It's a chain place...one step above fast food.  The food was average, the way it always is.  The issue with this Friday's is the service.  I don't know if the wait staff is just young, or new, or what, but it was a disaster from the moment we sat down.  We heard the words ""I'm sorry"" from our waitress 9 times...way too many for one simple meal.  First we waiting a good 15 minutes before we were asked if we wanted a drink.  There was hardly anyone in there.  We order a chicken nacho appetizer, and were given the wrong one.  We weren't sure if it was wrong, so we tried to flag her down to check.  She did place the order for the incorrect one, and credited our bill for the one actually ordered, only to charge us for the wrong one that we didn't want.  So we had to pay for something we didn't want.  That, unfortunately, came out of her tip.  Getting refills for iced tea required 4 requests, and it just went on and on like that the entire visit. We will go to just about anywhere else next time we are in that shopping area.  All I can say is this...if you have a hankering for Friday's...endless apps, drinks, or Jack Daniel's everything...do yourself a favor and drive the extra 10 minutes to the Orland Park location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park

Rori N.,"Richton Park, IL",0,4,,1.0,8/23/2017,"I will start by saying that my husband and I frequent this TGIF's once every week or two however tonight I went with 5 other women and it was the worst experience I have ever had at this particular restaurant! First after waiting to be seated for 10 minutes, when we could clearly see many empty seats, we were seated. Took the waiter another 10 minutes to acknowledge we were even there. Did bring us the chips and salsa that he must have heard us talking about and  a significant portion of the chips were soggy. After taking our order and walking away we realized that he never asked about drinks! We got him to come back, ordered drinks but then it took him another 20 minutes to come back and tell us that the bartender just told him they were out of Cabernet! We chose not to substitute. Then one of the people at our table ordered an appetizer for her meal and we specifically asked him to bring it with our entrees. It showed up about 10 minutes before the rest of the food and it wasn't even cooked all the way. She sent it back!Then the rest of the entrees showed up anybody with fries, the fries were cold! My Cheeseburger showed up and had bacon on it and wasn't supposed to! I sent it back! Another one came out and again completely wrong!!! The waiter had repeated what it was supposed to be correctly so it was obviously not his fault. Apologized for the problems and said everything had been coming out of the kitchen wrong tonight. I asked to speak to the manager who didn't come over to our table for another 10-15 minutes, we informed her of the situation, she apologized and adjusted the check with and additional amount off but I doubt if we will ever return to this establishment!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park
Kay S.,"Tinley Park, IL",22,42,62,1.0,1/4/2016,"The WORST Fridays I have ever been to ... why I've been here twice is beyond me... I always get super happy to get in my car and DRIVE AWAY!!! The service is slow. From the time you walk in, you wait to be seated because there is no host stand. You just have to wait until someone sees you, and then they don't ask where you'd like to be seated, so you end up in an area you don't want to be in, like the bar, when you'd like a somewhat quiet meal. Both times I've been here, my servers have an attitude like they genuinely do not care about anything. The food at any TGIF has never really been my favorite, so I expect average food every time I go to a TGIF restaurant. I will note that my first iced tea I ordered at this location tasted alright, the second one tasted like they used toilet water... it tasted really off... maybe spoiled *gag* I did not bother to ask for a replacement, I was ready to just get out of there. Lazy staff, and I say this because this is a dirty, dirty, dirty establishment! The restrooms were disgusting, toilet paper and paper towels were everywhere and it smelled like pee.

Charlotte D.,"Matteson, IL",0,1,,1.0,8/11/2017,"This is the First time I felt compelled to write a review. Me and my Family went here for dinner on late Friday evening. It wasn't busy at all. As soon as you walk in the greeters were nowhere to be found, finally someone comes to take us to our seat. Walking to our seat the Hostess apologizes for how dirty the restaurant looks! Well that was an understatement....it was Beyond Dirty, it was Filthy and Disgusting! The floor was covered with Food and Trash. The overall restaurant was just a Mess! The menus were falling apart. We had to cover our drinks and food with napkins from the nets that were flying around. The service was horrible, waited forever for refill on drinks. Food was semi warm to cold. Bread sticks were hard. Server never took away dirty dishes and glasses. It just sat on the table piled up. As we were leaving out the door someone dropped food near the front door near the hostess area and it just stayed there while the hostess just continued on her phone texting. We finally leave just to see more food on the ground outside the restaurant and half of the staff outside joking around and taking a cigarette break. Staff definitely lazy and just don't care!

Ok I understand it was a concert evening and there were more people than expected; however, Tinley park host a concert almost once a week throughout the summer, I don't see the reason for this kinda chaos.  After we were seated, our waitress disappeared. After a long wait time, A bigger group of people were seated after us were served with drink and appetizers, and we were still sitting around the table with not even a glass of water. A few waitress walked by our table and just completely ignore us. So we got up and left.

Marge B.,"Tinley Park, IL",80,4,,5.0,7/28/2016,I am amazed at all the negative reviews. We have gone to this location at least 5 times this past year and have always received excellent service.

Who goes to TGIF in a city as amazing at providing delicious local food as Chicago? Apparently the fans that took me out to dinner after my Chicago show. I can't complain because they insisted on buying me dinner which was lovely. But I really didn't order much because I can't stand TGIF.

For a pesc-atarian, i was forced to order a black bean burger (which i don't like), or the fridays shrimp if i was gonna keep it on the lower-price side. I was honestly upset that i had to pay for this lunch. My lunch was bland and it looked like they threw it on the plate! The shrimp had no flavor at all and i maybe ate half. They were really crunchy and still has the tails attached with crunchy breading(?) on it. They got ride of the grilled shrimp skewers which were way better than this. The entree has the company name on it and is a poor example of dinners I've enjoyed here in the past.  I got the mozzarella sticks also, which were super delicious but no enough to be an entree or redeem the restaurant for the yucky shrimp. They also no longer have the pick 3 for 12.99 that included the dessert. Kind of mad about all of the stripes points i have to spend now because id been saving them for about a year and a half to get some of their decent entrees.  Our waitress was also slow and didn't bring us any napkins with our food.  Fridays is really going downhill in my opinion.

Maximilian Z.,"Chicago, IL",2,27,9,4.0,3/3/2013,"This location is just off of Harlem & I-80 in the corner of a strip mall. Three words for this place: ""Jack Daniels menu"".  Order ANYTHING you like from it, and it's always good.  I'm in here at least twice a month for either the JD BBQ chicken breast, or, especially recently - the JD salmon.  The JD salmon has always been cooked right for me and has never been served burnt or dried out. The last time I was here, I saw a spiked Guinness shake on the menu, and had to try it.  That was one sneaky shake - just the right amount of sweet and stout to excite the palate. Their menu computer is even smart enough to ask about food allergies if you specify something out of the norm: like ""no extra nuts on my Brownie Obsession"".  I'm not allergic to nuts, but they're not a nice thing to bite into with dentures :O The ambiance depends a LOT on the time of day & if there's local sports on TV.  It tends to be on the upper ends of the noise spectrum, especially if it's a Friday  / Saturday night.  I tend to be here during lunch a lot, so the place is well lit during the day, and the right amount of light at night. If you want better service, and DON'T have kids with you, eat in the bar area.  It's much quicker, and you don't have to deal with screaming kids in the main dining room.  (Oh, did my fork accidentally pop your kids balloon?  I'm sorry...) Since I'm here often, I tend to be a bit overly critical of this particular location because I know the food is good and I expect EVERYTHING to be good.  If it's NOT, I know exactly who the GM is (and I DON'T tell the server before hand I know who the GM is - I want real, unbiased service), and believe me, she will address and fix the problem before I leave.  I also make sure to tell her that the servers did an exceptional job, and I let my tips reflect that as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Matt H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,4,,1.0,12/2/2015,Sat at the bar at 8:00 on a Wednesday night looking for a quick meal.  Restaurant and bar were basically empty.  Went 10 minutes with no service before leaving.  Bartender appeared far too busy talking to co-workers / watching a basketball game.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Helen M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",30,7,5,2.0,10/3/2014,Sirloin 6oz was chewy and dry. Couldn't even eat it. They forgot to bring out our appetizers.  And the waitress seemed to be in a bad mood. When they did bring out our food we sat for a couple minutes because the waitress took of so fast we didn't get a chance to ask for utensils. Had to ask for refills too. We where treated as if we were an inconvenience. Horrible!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Meghan B.,"Tinley Park, IL",26,6,,1.0,8/27/2014,"I've been to this location a handful of times and the service is always poor. During my most recent trip it was nearly midnight and the place wasn't very busy, but the service was still slow. At one point my husband walked up to the bar and asked if he could take my drink-we could see it, but the server hadn't brought it to the table yet. We had to ask our server for an itemized bill instead of one with just the total. I really wish this location wasn't terrible because I live nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Marie S.,"Lansing, IL",0,4,1,3.0,1/2/2015,"Came here on new years day,walked in and was barely acknowledged at first, worker was taking an order over the phone..finally she spoke and sat us at a high table which was not ideal for us..we asked to be moved to a booth and when we did, the waiter told us to grab our own menus off the table so we can relocate which was very rude.I THOUGHT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GRAB THE MENUS...!!that's their job..finally we were sat down at a comfortable booth...the waiter we had acted like she was ready to go and non-chalant about everything. Other than that the food was great and service was speedy...0 stars for service. 5 stars for food...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40

Lisa P.,"South Holland, IL",42,91,46,4.0,11/16/2011,"Well,My yelper's here is another great review. I am happy as I'm writing this review. Fisrt,because I've had such a great devotion with God this morning and secondly my dinner yesterday at TGIF!  I believe I have found my second to-go-to place for my husband and I.

I've been here two times and I will be back for a 3rd,4th,&5th...(you get my drift) because I like it here that much and so does my ken doll(that's what I call my hubby).  So if you're looking for a great place to-go-to on hand for hanging with the spouse,kids,friends,or anybody come here!  *** FYI: Oh,yeah you have to try the mango and peach lemonade slush it's deli-sh:) AND BOTTOMLESS REFILLS FOR ONLY $2.99!!!

Melissa C.,"Mokena, IL",19,32,15,4.0,7/19/2013,"Good service tonight, not the best!  Asked for a table in the bar and the hostess was waiting for the busser to clean it.  Looked like only one busser remained on duty.  She finally cleaned it after I saw a table with 2 glasses left on it.  Food came out FAST!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Gail S.,"Wilmington, IL",0,14,,4.0,3/13/2015,"Sometimes things just don't go well and unfortunately today was one of those days at TGIF for lunch. Friday during Lent and not many choices, ordered the black bean burger,  salt grinder empty, waited for that , ketchup empty, waited do that, burger was pretty good, had to send the avocado back since there was a black hair on it. Just one of those days when I should have packed a lunch",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Nichole L.,"Chicago, IL",34,51,11,5.0,7/11/2012,"Ok so TGI Fridays now offers 2 for $10 specials and let me just say AWESOMENESS!!! I ordered the spinach flatbread ( sooooo good) & the crusted chicken pasta ( soooo good) & my friend ordered the white cheddar queso dip with the same pasta as myself!!!!  Not only was the food good but my friend and I were full and took some home!!!!  If your on a budget, if your not on a budget check this menu out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Michael T.,"Tinley Park, IL",1,24,4,2.0,10/12/2013,"Came here after work with a buddy and ordered some type of pasta and my friend ordered the chicken Caesar salad. The service was horrible! The dish I got was not good, below par. We had to ask for refills everytime as well. I do not recommend going here!

Jackie B.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,1,,2.0,8/6/2013,"I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta and there were two long pieces of hair in my food. The chicken on the meal was also very poor quality. I've gone to other Fridays and normally enjoy the meal and service, but I didn't leave with that feeling this time. I would check your food when it comes out of the kitchen if you eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Sofia Y.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,2,1.0,4/13/2014,"Can I give zero stars? It's unfortunate because I think Fridays has great food, but their service is lacking....big time.. I asked 3 different people on 3 different occasions to mop up a disgusting sticky spot that was on the floor near our seats and do you know what I got? A bunch of workers congregating on the side doing nothing I guess mentioning the fact that I had the audacity to ask them to do something....that was their job and a possibly a badreflection on their restaurant. Needless to say, I won't be back. Oh and to make matters worse, very slow service and no refills on our drinks because our waitress and her posse were too busy standing on the sidelines not doing a thing. Oh well, as far as I'm concerned they ruined her tip and that location's reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Courtney O.,"Oak Forest, IL",465,270,90,4.0,7/12/2009,"Okay, here's the deal: the service is spectacular and the drinks are divine. Family-friendly to the point that I can eat there with my two kids (2 + 3 y/o) but can also head out for a night with the hubby or my friends, etc. The food is great, BUT there aren't a whole lot of vegetarian options if you're like me and detest salads. This is pretty much one of the last restaurants in existence that doesn't--at least at this current time--offer some sort of veggie burger substitute. They offer a turkey burger, but unless that's just a code word, I'm still gonna have to pass. Overall, a win, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Maggie W.,"Chicago, IL",73,176,22,3.0,2/17/2009,"I normally don't review chain restaurants, but I had to comment on the service from TGIFridays. Knowing how chain restaurants work (I used to work at the Olive Garden and Bennigan's), I'm guessing this is pretty consistent across all TGIFs. Anyway, the service is very interesting. One server takes your order, someone else brings you your drinks, someone else brings your food. I'm guessing the other people are food runners and it's not a case of all the servers just being really helpful. I think the last time I was there I counted 4 different people coming to our table. There's nothing wrong with this model of service, but I just find it amusing. The service is still very good an friendly.  Also, in comparison to similar chain restaurants, I do like their menu. But I will never understand how chain restaurants in the suburbs always have like an hour wait on the weekends. Oh suburbanites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
Amanda D.,"Alsip, IL",2,3,,2.0,2/2/2015,"I've been here a few times and the food and service were great. Last week we did not have such great service but it was not the fault of our waiter(she was awesome). We were met with a very rude, aggressive and belligerent patron while trying to use the handicapped restroom(one of the people in our party is in a wheelchair), which by the way is reserved for handicapped people just like a handicapped parking space is! She was politely reminded that we were waiting for that washroom for about 10 minutes now and she then proceeded to scream, curse, and insult our entire party in-front on the whole section of the restaurant we were in, which included children(whom were also in our party). She glared and laughed at us as we were trying to leave. We were assured she would be removed but found out by calling 25 minutes later that she was allowed to stay in the restaurant and continue on with her night. It is not okay to treat other people that way, especially someone who is handicapped, but it's even more insulting that she was allowed to stay in the restaurant as if were actions weren't totally inappropriate and disgusting. You can't control your patrons but you can let them know that you won't tolerate such hate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40

Josh P.,"Frankfort, IL",18,35,1,5.0,2/10/2010,"I've been here numerous times. One of my favorite restaurants. The menu has a great selection and 98% of the staff is very nice and helpful. I do like the style of service with multiple different people coming to your table, however then I feel obligated to tip everyone! I have only had one bad experience. I used to be a server so I know how frustrating it can get when its super busy. On this particular night I was with a few friends and  I believe our server was just having a bad night. While the host was seating us he was screaming at her for seating us in his section. He was very rude the entire night. I did talk to a manager who offered to comp part of the bill, which I declined, but the manager was very helpful and understanding. I felt terrible for the host so I gave her the $15 of the servers $20 dollar tip. Oh well I guess he will learn to be nicer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tinley-park?start=40
