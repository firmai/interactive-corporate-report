Donna F.,"Ripon, CA",1,83,397,5.0,10/29/2017,"BJ's is our favorite restaurant and BJ's in Modesto is awesome. We've had some hits and misses on the food and service but 99% of the time their right on perfect. They have a great crew such as Teo, Yvonne, and Micala.  We have had so many dish here: California club flatbread impressive tasting; Margherita Fresca flatbread, it's OK, I like meat on my pizza. Chicken wings are as good as their neighbor's, Chili and Sriracha Queso is delicious; Seared Ahi salad was good but would liked a little more ahi on it; Mahi-Mahi tacos very tasty, a favorite of mine; Honey-Sriracha Brussel sprouts smell and taste like Brussels sprouts, not my favorite, didn't order that again; Hickory Brisket and bacon was good, strong BBQ sauce flavor; Bacon-Guacamole deluxe burger was awesome; our favorite is their Piranha nachos doctored up....AMAZING. They have great beers such as the Tatonka, Jeremiah Red and the host other brewery's beers.. Back again got to meet a new bartender, Angela, really sweet and great services.   Tio and kitchen staff did an amazing job on our nachos. Back again, We have been to other BJ's location and the food has been good.  However we really enjoy the crew at the Modesto location.....good people.  We are always met with smiles and true kindness.    It just a great group if people: Chris, Tio, Oscar, Elliott,  Micala, and",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto
Brittany C.,"Modesto, CA",15,7,2,1.0,10/26/2017,"My two friends and I went to BJ's on a Thursday night, after the dinner rush. We ordered the cheese curds, chips and guac, meatballs with mashed potatoes, a chicken salad and a pizookie. None of it was edible. All of it was room temp, except the potatoes which were hot in some bites, cold in others, so I suspect they microwaved them. The tortilla chips were stale, the cheese curds chewy, no dressing on the salad and the cookie was so cold it actually kept the ice cream from melting. On top of all that, it took us over an hour to receive these, and they are all appetizers other than the salad.  Our server kind of apologized, you can tell she'd been apologizing for quite some time now. We did speak to the manager, we explained all of it wasn't worth eating but I'll take my salad home and add my own dressing to it. (Can't mess up chopped lettuce.) She did comp all of our order except our 1 cocktail and 1 pepsi. This was 2 1/2 hours of waiting for food we couldn't eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto
Chip L.,"San Leandro, CA",38,8,4,5.0,10/7/2017,"My wife, daughter and I popped into the Concord, CA location yesterday after a funeral. We were in need of a good cheering up, which we tend to do with food. We popped into BJ'S by chance, and were very impressed by the food and staff. I was especially pleased with the pizza I ordered, but I digress... We came to the Modesto location today because we were waiting for roadside service after visiting the mall. Battery was dead, and we were bummed. Again, the service and food were remarkable. Our server Megan was very sympathetic to our cause, and limited food order (we had beers, juice/soda, and an app sampler). She treated us with the same care as folks ordering meals, and checked on us frequently, with a very pleasant demeanor. My wife and I had already been saying that BJ'S might become 'our place' after yesterday's experience. Today sealed the deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto
Christie R.,"Fresno, CA",1,7,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Me and 8 of my coworkers came here for dinner on a Tuesday the 2nd and had the worst dining experience. Our server never smiled and took forever with everything. We were there almost 3 hours!! My food was ok but it was cold. In the beginning we sat with our salads and it took us 15 min after getting our salads to get any silverware to eat it with. And in the end when we waited a long while to order desert he comes out with our bills, we told him we wanted desert and he acted so irritated with us. to another server. Who was also incredibly slow but at least she was nice. Pizookies came out and they brought one of them that was wrong and took so long for the server to come back that my that time it was all melted and we just kept it. Eventually said he was going on break and gave us. I will never go to another bjs again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto
Erendira L.,"Modesto, CA",17,76,61,2.0,12/30/2017,"Service here is handled by a team of sloths. Don't come hungry, because getting a server to take your order takes a long time. Getting your food served takes even longer. Don't bother ordering a pazookie unless you have another 30 minutes to kill after you've finished your meal. Getting your bill takes a long time too.

Erica A.,"Brentwood, CA",70,3,1,2.0,12/17/2017,"We were seated fairly quickly yesterday during a busy time. We waited about 30 minutes for our food but our waitress was kind and apologetic. The reason for the two stars was the sad, soggy, COLD, chicken club and bottom of the barrel fries. I picked the sandwich apart looking for something edible because I was starving. We paid the bill 20% tip because it wasn't the waitresses fault. The bathroom was nasty. Water/urine on the floor, clogged bathrooms, paper towels everywhere. No seat covers in my daughters stall. Kind of bummed. I have never had a bad experience at BJs over here in Brentwood. The wait is always long but the food is usually worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto
Carole C.,"Modesto, CA",28,4,,2.0,10/21/2017,"This was my first time here however my daughter's and husband have been here before. This will be my last time. We ordered 2 apps before our dinner and received 1- they had to reorder 1 as ours had been given to another customer. We didn't get it until AFTER we received our entrees. Half of our table (of 6) had issues with our orders. My husband's jambalaya was missing shrimp, 1 chopped salad didnt receive dressing until our 3rd request for it and my sweet potato fries were ice cold- the plate was warmer than the fries.  I imagine this place must lose a lot of money, comping food when simple things could've been done to correct the problems. Half our table ended up getting comped which was fine  but if this is an indication of how they operate, I certainly won't be back, comped or not. All of the reviews about service are misleading. Our service was chaotic at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto

However, our last visit we had such great customer service we decided to write a review. There actually was  a mishap with our order and for some odd reason our pizza was taking a little longer than expected. The manager Sarah went above and beyond to make it right and made our experience worth the wait. Along with the attentive service with management our server (lizzeth D) was so sweet and very apologetic for the mishap. She made sure our drinks were always filled and always asked if we needed anything every time she passed the table. We have three small children so something always comes up and she was willing to get everything we needed. We really appreciate the service they gave our family and reminded us how costumer service should be! Thank you Sarah and Lizzeth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto

He said we would be seated shortly, but after noticing a bunch of other parties that got there after us, were being seated first, we let the host know again.

Chris F.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,"BJ's again disappointing! Working in the mall right next to BJ's I would go there once a week for lunch. I would say a least 40 % of the time there was a mistake with my order. I decided to stop going there, which I have not been back in a year. Today I wanted to buy my employee's lunch for working New Years and placed a order online. When I got there to pick up they did not have my order. I had a print out and confirmation of the order. I has told that 2 of the four items were sold out, but they could start making the other items now if I wanted to wait. Had to go back and tell everyone that lunch was not on me, because BJ's can't seem to get anything right. Shame on me for trying this place again. I guess staying away a year wasn't enough time to forget how bad this place is. Never making this mistake again, staying away for good this time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto

I placed my order, when I get there the curbside parking is full with empty cars. So I call and ask where do I park? The lady on the phone was very rude, called me out of my name twice and then hung up on me. Then she comes out with my food, hands it to me, wasn't friendly at all and after she takes my payment I proceed to look into the bag and notice that my Cesar salad was actually a house salad with Cesar dressing. How hard is it to make a Cesar salad?! I also got a burger with fries and ""Cesar salad"" so I tried a fry and to my not so likely surprise it was cold. When I get home about 10 min away. And guys I understand food isn't going to be super hot like it just came outta the kitchen but my chicken fried steak burger was cold. I'm talking like my melted cheese was cold like you melt it and stick it in the fridge then serve it. Not to mention that I think the burger itself was undercooked, almost raw.

Good enough for a dine in after a long day of shopping at the mall. I got the traditional flatbread pizza which was okay, a little too soggy for the crust from my perspective. Got a side of house Cesar salad on the side, it was heavy on the dressing so if you're not a fan of that ask for the dressing on the side. The best part was the great server and the Pazooki for dessert. The Pazooki alone is enough to make me come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto
Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1670,147,857,4.0,7/21/2016,"I come here with the family quite a bit. It's a huge menu but I stick to just the deep dish pizza. I tried other options but never really cared for much of their food but I love the deep dish pizza. They have many options or even a build your own. I usually split a large with my wife and get half one option and half another. All the options are great so we switch up all the time. They brew their own beer, the Hopstorm IPA is excellent. They have many beers on tap and a full bar area.  Weekends will get very busy but you can call ahead so you can alleviate some of the wait time there. There is a ton of large screen TVs around the restaurant so you don't have to worry about missing your favorite team kick some butt while you have some pizza and beers. I've always had good service and the food comes out reasonably quick.

Liz H.,"Modesto, CA",0,46,,2.0,11/22/2017,"Really, BJ's?! You went from being one of my favorite chain restaurants to the bottom of the barrel. Tonight is the night before Thanksgiving. So as not to mess up my kitchen, and because I had a gift card, and as a treat for my kids and grandkids, we decided to go to BJ's for dinner.  I called for a reservation early in the day, but was told it was not an option. So our party of seven, five adults and 2 kids arrived at 5:30. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait. No problem. Then we waited and waited, and waited.  After an hour we told the host we would be okay with being split up. And then we sat there while over 20 smaller parties were seated. We were told a party of eight was done and should be leaving soon. Only they didn't.  Finally my son in law asked for a manager. She told us appetizers would be comped and took the orders for the kid's drinks and dinner. After we were finally seated, an hour and a half after arrival, our waiter told us again and again how our lousy service was not his fault. Maybe so, but the delivery of the pre-ordered kid's meals took forever and our dinners took even longer, and did not come out together. Then my daughter made the grievous error of ordering dessert, and me, a second glass of wine. We waited, and waited, and waited.  Thank Goodness the two toddlers were well behaved!

Umar G.,"Turlock, CA",91,257,22,3.0,6/25/2017,"Not too bad, but not great either. Large corporate restaurants always have this challenge of not becoming too bureaucratic and rule based rather than consumer oriented. It tends to take good management to not lose that aspect. In this case, management is failing. Table prep was hasty with no sweetener on the table. Certain sections were completely empty and yet the hostess refused to open them and was offering 25 - 30 minute waits instead (and this is at 5.00 pm on a Friday so it still wasn't rush dinner time).The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Run of the mill offerings, though I do like their avocado spring rolls (what I mainly came for). I wasn't disappointed in them, but I was a little disappointed with my salad. The Ahi tuna portion wasn't generous and the salad hadn't been tossed properly, so all the dressing was at the bottom. They got the spouses first burger wrong but eventually fixed the problem. And the bill without drinks was over 50 bucks.. a little too expensive for a medium end corporate chain.  Overall if there was nothing else around and I was stuck at the mall, I would go here again ... otherwise I'd probably go with Texas Roadhouse .. I feel I get a better bang for my buck there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=20

Dee H.,"Escalon, CA",61,67,14,1.0,6/17/2017,"I'm giving a one star for the sole fact that they could have made me very sick or killed me. I am allergic to shellfish, squid, and other seafood. I was never informed, nor does it state anything about how they cook all of their fries and fried food with the seafood and shellfish.  I ordered a burger and fries, while it was very good, something wasn't right. I started to feel my face and mouth swell as I broke out in hives. My mouth was itching badly as well. It wasn't until I actually found a piece of calamari in with my fries that I realized what the problem was.  I immediately called the waitresses attention to which she responded by calling over a manager. I don't remember his name, but he was rude. So rude. He basically said that I should have asked if they cooked any of their food with what I was allergic to. Seriously? That is not my responsibility. You as the establishment serving the food, need to notify or at least state a warning somewhere clearly in the menu.  We paid the bill and headed towards the door, I needed an epinephrine pen and a cold bath for the swelling. As we were about to walk out the door he sarcastically stopped me and handed me a card that was a coupon for 10% off my next meal. As if I planned to return? He was rude through the entire ordeal and had no sympathy.  I even contacted corporate. This happened a while ago and I contacted corporate promptly and haven't heard back from them either. I don't think they care about their customers well being and satisfaction with their products.  Beware if you have any sort of allergy while visiting this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=20

I am honestly shocked that food would be allowed to leave the kitchen and delivered to table in such horrid condition. Our Waitress was very nice and sympathetic but how embarrassing for her. The manager came over and apologized but quickly made an excuse stating that my order had been crossed up with a customer who ordered their hamburger extremely rare....hmmm I guess that customer also likes their hamburgers served cold with a greasy stale bun. What a disaster! I am honestly not one to complain and I seriously have to feel very inspired to write a review but I think it's important that people know my experience. BJ's seriously!

Armand A.,"Modesto, CA",1,27,,3.0,10/14/2017,"Everybody really likes BJ's in town, but I've never really been hyped up about it. In truth, I didn't come for the longest time because I believed that the hype would die eventually.  Once I caved, I first noticed that this place is always busy and people are happy and laughing when they are here. The food is good, but I'm always going to lean on the deep dish pizza- clearly a gem on the menu. The hype didn't make too much sense, seeming disproportionate, as the food was good but not to the extremity of what people say. So I thought. It took me till my 3rd visit to try the Pizooki, and then I understood.  Ultimately, the restaurant is always busy and the food is generally good. The dessert is the best part of the night, but that's just not something that one should regularly engage in. I would not recommend this restaurant, but wouldn't dissuade anybody who would like to try and am not averse to going again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=40

He was personable, friendly, attentive, and suggestive.

Anyhow after that a different server came and took our order and I was confused because should I have had the first server ? That server didn't go on break or go home I saw him after I left. So was it that he didn't want to serve my table? And it was not a busy night FYI. Anyhow my server didn't seem so pleased to be serving us either which made me feel more like a bother than a customer. We waited a really long time for our food to come out.

They have an extensive 20 page menu which was all sticky and gross. They also have a kids' menu. My kids got the pizza and mini corn dogs. We asked for that to be put in right away and it came out in a timely fashion along with our calamari appetizer which lacked a little flavor. 30 minutes later we still didn't have our entrees. The server was nice and apologetic saying that their system was down, so that's what was causing the delay, but 45 minutes to get food is unacceptable. Steak was on the dry side and Super Salad was fine. Nice selection of drinks but would not go here again, though convenient to mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=80

Two times in a row this location has had some kind of communication problem that left us waiting for food longer than expected. The food is very good, service is great and they have comp'd us both times admitting their error. The first time the error led to others getting their food ahead of us even though we were there first. My wife and I ate while my son waited. The second time on Father's Day the waitresses tablet froze and I got my food before my wife and son. All 3 meals came out at separate times. We could not eat as a family.

All of my friends know that suggesting BJs for dinner will result in a fight because of how completely shitty this place is. It's been years since the last time I set foot in here and time has not helped. The whole time I was sitting here wondering how the hell did I end up here.  It's my cousins birthday and we have a table of 10 people. I understand that larger parties take a while to get seated and for our food to come out but out experience was ridiculous. Not only did we have to wait over an hour and a half for a table on a MONDAY night but it took over 20 minutes for someone to even ask us what we want to drink.  Anyways, we order our drinks and then appetizers. I had the best (worst) beginnings. My table was convinced that everything was picked off of half eaten plates and put together. It was cold and stale. Whatever we were so hungry we didn't even say anything. Then comes our food, let's forget about how long it took to finally get to us. The food was cold and nasty. Two of our friends were told they were out of what they ordered. Of course they waited until everyone's food was out to say something. My friends didn't want to wait and just said they didn't want anything. I could barely swallow my burger because of how dry my throat was. Whatever. We dealt with it.

Our server was very friendly and took our order quickly. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I went with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken to compare it with the one here in town. My girl went with a mini vegetarian pizza and we both split wedge cut fries. Their french fries are good. She suggested them. If you're eating a vegetarian meal and want good fried food, try the wedge fries! By the time our food came out, the restaurant was starting to fill up with more and more people. The lunch crowd was finally arriving! Luckily we were well into our meal to where our ticket wasn't put into a queue with a lot of people in front of us. My food tasted the same as the Stockton location. They even slack by giving you a tiny portion of broccoli. I've always joked about there being a shortage of broccoli in the back at the Stockton Location. I can confirm it's standard to ship this dish out with a small amount of vegetables. I asked to get a side of broccoli to get a good portion of veggies with my meal. Instead of looking at the plate and acknowledging the short portion, she didn't have a problem charging me around $4 for the side of broccoli (photographed below).  Complaining aside, the food tasted fine. Neither of us had a problem with the staff, and the waiting time was minimal for our food, getting seated, and getting our drinks. This place is clean inside and they're in a great location to get a lot of foot traffic (by the malls in Modesto).

The last time I was there for dinner, it took 40 minutes and the steak was so covered with black pepper (after I told them light on the seasoning), scraping it off wouldn't even make it edible. the waiter took it back, but never even so much as asked if I wanted anything else until he brought the bill, and we were ready to leave. I had honestly thought that since he didn't ask if I wanted something else, they were going to correct the problem and bring me another steak. It's also one of the few restaurants that doesn't offer any bread with dinner, you actually have to pay for it. A few weeks before that, I tried their spaghetti which was worse than something you would find in the freezer section of the local grocery store. It boggles the mind as to how someone can mess up a simple marinara sauce so badly it become inedible.

My burger was made well this time and was greatly enjoyed.  The beer was cool and fresh.  At first I was kind of iffy, I was with 4 other family members and all their drinks where brought and our server brought all the drinks except mine.. and then asked for our orders and I had to ask her again for my lemonade.  Another thing was that when we had chips and salsa, and we ran out of chips but their was plenty of salsa as we had not yet recieved our food.  Our server came and asked to take the plate and if we where done, we assumed she would automatically just replace the chips being we had more salsa left.  But all in all it was super pleasant and the food was great, and thats what counts :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=120

It was the WORST Service Ever!!! It started out waiting 20 minutes for a table, then we were seated at 6:20, by 6:30 NO One came by to get Beverage order! So my friends husband went to find someone & I Called B.J.'s while Sitting at the table! Finally a Server showed up! It went Downhill from there. There were 6 of us, 4 Adults & 2 Children, we Waited anywhere from 20-60 Minutes for our Beverages to Arrive! Then we had to Wait for Silverware & Napkins! Finally food came, But they Messed up her husband's order, plus he Didn't get his Soda until an Hour After we were Seated! It was a 'Comedy of Errors' Except it Wasn't Funny!!! my friend Waited 30 minutes for a glass of wine, her friend Waited 40 minutes for her Beer, the Boy's Waited 35 minutes for their Beverages!!! I Waited 3 Times to get my Water Refilled! We were there 2 hours & 20 minutes, We even Waited 20 minutes for our Dessert After the Manager Personally took the Order!!! I asked a server to Close the Blinds, since the Sun was in my Eyes, I Thanked her & she just Glared at me and Kept Walking!!! The Manager Apologised, but Our Server ""Disappeared"" for 45 minutes, then ""Miraculously"" he Appeared when the Manager Showed up to see how things were going! The food was good, but Not good Enough to go through the Grief we went Through & we Were NOT the Only Customers having problems!!! I realize that they were busy from all the Fund Raiser Guests, but that is NO Excuse for Not being ""Prepared"" for Customers, it's Not like this was Sprung on them the last minute, this is the 2nd time a Fund Raiser had been held there!!!

I spoke with the Manager on Duty to inform her of how great he was. He was attentive to not only our table, but the tables around us. He was very customer service oriented and always made sure to ask if there was anything else we needed. Thank you Loggan for the great customer service.

He said sure, but proceeded to attend other customers at the bar. I understood and continued to wait patiently, unfortunately he never came around to wipe down the bar top nor give us our menus.

M P.,"Modesto, CA",0,6,3,2.0,9/25/2017,"We decided to eat here for lunch on Sunday, showed up close to 12:30 pm. We had a group of 7 so we knew there would be a wait. We checked in with the hostess, she tells us it will be 20 minutes and asks if we want to receive a text message when our table is ready. We say yes, enter in our phone number for the text and go outside to wait on the bench. About 15 minutes later we get a text saying our table is ready. We go inside, let the hostess know we got the text and she asks us to wait over by the side. The place she had us stand to wait for our table happened to be the stroller corral, so we were squishing together each time a new stroller was parked. We waited in the stroller corral for over 5 minutes while they sat several more customers. Finally, I ask who I assume was the manager (she was ordering the hostess and waitresses around) what we were waiting on since we received a text message that our table was ready. She jumped down my throat saying she called our name 3 times and we didn't answer so they gave our table away. I asked why she called us when we asked for the text message. At first she said she didn't know we wanted to be text messaged but when I called her out on that (considering we got a text message from them) she became even angrier and started arguing with me that we should have heard her calling our name and should have answered her if we wanted to be seated. She also asked why we didn't text them back to let them know we were coming in! What the hell??! We were literally right outside the front door and walked in as soon as we got the text! She was rude and extremely argumentative. I am NOT one of those ""the customer is always right"" person, but in this case, she was flat out wrong. We followed what they offered, a text service to notify when the table was ready. We weren't asked to text back, we walked right in and then we were berated by this so-called manager. We cancelled our table request and walked right across the way to Buffalo Wild Wings, had great food and great service. We were seated within 5 minutes on game day Sunday at 1 pm. As for BJs, they lost a $150 tab due to poor management.

Leslie R.,"Round Rock, TX",4,7,,1.0,7/31/2017,"I understand that restaurants have human beings working for them and mistakes are made, heck I make mistakes all the time. What makes a difference is how it's address and handled when it does happen. This is where they failed in my experience. I ordered the tuna seared salad specifically because it has avocado in it and I was having a crazy craving for it. When it was delivered, no avocado. I kindly informed my server and she graciously apologized and took it back. When my second salad arrived (delivered by someone other than my server) it had no avocado in it. When my server returned to check in I told her and she was embarrassed at the point. She offered to take it back... I suggested she bring me a side of avocado. She agreed, apologized again, and said she would have a manager come by my table. Well, that never happened. You'd think this would be a time that would warrant it. Who knows what happened, maybe she told the manager, maybe she didn't, maybe the manager stepped out, who knows, there's the human being factor again, right? Will I return there next time I'm in town, likely. However, I hope the manager reads these reviews and hopefully will use it as a training opportunity as to what to do when this happens... servers should treat things like this as ""mission critical"" and send someone, anyone, by the table and ""act"" like a manager to apologize.

Tylor M.,"Seaside, CA",39,94,3,1.0,3/20/2015,"This is one of my wife's favorite restaurants.  I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Modesto.  The last two times I've been in touch with this BJ's were two of the worst experiences I've ever had with any restaurant. On my wife's birthday, we came in with a group of about 10 family members.  We called ahead and showed up early, and the hosting staff told us it would be about 45 minutes wait after we arrived.  We weren't seated for over 2 hours.  More than half of the food ordered at our table had to be sent back.  Dishes were cold, unseasoned, and/or entirely wrong.  I chalked this one up to a fluke. We tried to go back for my wife's baby shower.  I called 6 hours in advance to see if they thought they could seat 7.  The hostess was quite short with me and said she would check with a manager.  After being on hold for 9 minutes, another person picked up the phone and asked how they could help.  I repeated my request, and said that someone was checking with the manager.  This employee told me the manager was in a meeting and would return my call within 15 minutes.  I didn't hear back, so I called an hour later.  The first employee answered the phone.  I repeated my request yet again.  She snapped at me and told me that they would not be able to accommodate us at all that evening, but that we were welcome to ""come by and walk the dining area.""  I was confused, and said ""no, thank you"" and that we would ""look for another place to eat."" An utter shame.  I'm glad I now live close to a BJ's that employs people who remember they are in the service industry, and who treat their customers with respect.  We went to BJ's in Salinas last night and had an excellent experience!  Thanks, Jeremy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=160

Tony S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/2/2015,"Absolutely horrible.  Would give 0 stars if I could.  I was staying in Modesto with my girlfriend around Christmastime and we decided to hit up BJ's for dinner.  Despite my desire to look on the bright side of things, I cannot help but feel utterly disappointed with this place.  WHAT WENT WRONG 1. OLD FOOD BITS IN THE DIP -- It seems this location reuses their dip, because when we ordered appetizers (Santa Fe Spring Rolls) there was a piece of chicken already in the dip.  Pretty gross. 2. FOOD NOT AS DESCRIBED -- There was no avocado in my California burger, which pretty much ruined the experience.  Would have ordered something else if they were out of avocado, but apparently the servers were not aware of what was going on in the kitchen. 3. THEY CARD -- Despite my being WELL above the legal drinking age, I was asked for my ID.  4. RUDE, INATTENTIVE STAFF -- Server would come by and ask how we were doing, but not wait long enough to listen for an answer, rendering their having asked in the first place pointless. CONCLUSION On the bright side, the beer wasn't bad, and we were promptly seated in a booth as requested, but it definitely wasn't good enough to justify the bad experience.  The thought of old food in the dip makes me sick.  Never coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=180
Bonnie G.,"Modesto, CA",19,2,,2.0,5/16/2016,"I wish they would put their pot roast back on the menu. It was so delicious! I have a very very limited diet so the only thing I can eat at BJ's now is the ribs, dry without any sauce; which you would think would be terrible but they are still delicious! That is at the BJ's in Fresno. I can also eat the white cheddar potatoes which are also delicious at most BJ's  ( I stay in AZ in the summer to babysit my grandsons and their food is also delicious) but for some reason at Modesto's location they are extremely dry. Also the service the last two visits has been lacking.  Did not have place settings on our table, had to ask for them.  Beverages were ordered but never brought until I asked a different server why.  The specifically ordered dry ribs came out with sauce and of course the potatoes were dry as a bone. They do not have ""real"" butter so I cannot use that to try to moisten them.  Asked for gravy and was told they do not have any. Use to be great there when they had the pot roast a few years back.  Also have tried the French dip sandwich which was dry and stringy at this location.  Have not tried it in Fresno yet.  The Pazookie, another use to be favorite of mine, was very doughy,  With me it is usually three strikes your out with a restaurant but since Fresno's location is so much better I will just drive the extra 15 minutes there to eat when I have to.  We live 45 minutes from Modesto and about an hour from Fresno.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=180

The other star is for our waiter who gave such great effort, only to be let down by the cooking staff. We ordered avocado egg rolls to start, a pizza, bleu cheese burger & fries, a strawberry splash cocktail and a pizookie for dessert. Only the pizza and the cocktail were tolerable. I'm not sure if my tastebuds are more refined now that I'm older, but this BJs was a true let down. I've been to many BJs in Southern California and the two that I've tried here, Modesto and Livermore have been awful. So let me start with the egg rolls. They tryin' to be Cheesecake Factory or what? Doesn't even come close, especially if you leave the end pits inside two of the egg rolls! No excuse. I bit into one and my husband bit into the other. All downhill from there. While ordering, our waiter had asked me if I wanted wedges or skinny fries and I chose the skinny. He also asked how I wanted my burger done, and I said 'well.' Hmmmm...can you guess what happens next? :) The burger comes out medium and the fries comes out as wedges.  I didn't even want to order dessert, but I was hoping they would redeem themselves. Not quite. Pizookie was a gooey, undercooked mess, I don't think that's normal.

Walt N.,"Roseville, CA",26,231,143,5.0,9/30/2014,"Came to Modesto on Saturday with a couple of teenage girls for a soccer tournament. They insisted on lunch at BJ's after the tournament.  After looking at all of the weak reviews, especially regarding service, I was skeptical, but knew I was no match for 16 year olds that had pazooki desserts on their minds. BJ's had the typical lunchtime wait of about 25 minutes. We were prepared for a long wait for food, etc., so if the service was weak, it was not going to be a big surprise. The kids wanted to see the games on the big screen tv's, soak up the atmosphere of the restaurant and have a good time, regardless of the slow food service. In reality, the service was about as good as it gets. Our server had water to our table within a minute of our seating, took our order promptly, and the appetizer plate of avocado rolls was in front of us within minutes of ordering.  The rolls were fantastic. One of the girls ordered clam chowder, which was just about as good as you would hope to get at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  The meal service was truly perfect. The side salads were fresh and well prepared, and the main courses, of which we had three different at our table, were all excellent.  The water and drink glasses were kept constantly filled, the server was polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu items.  Dessert was no exception, the pazookies were brought to the table fresh from the oven. The restaurant was packed the entire time we dined, yet service was exceptional.

We ordered a large sweet pig with NO tomatoes and on half of the pizza, we said light cheese. When our pizza came out there were big chunks of tomatoes with NO cheese. Our waitress even said she noticed that there was no cheese on the pizza and saw the tomatoes, but looked at her paper and saw she wrote light cheese and no tomatoes, but gave it to us anyway. On one of the slices, my fiancé noticed something green on the pizza that looked like mold. The general manager, Fred came because my fiancé wanted to ask what it was. He said it wasn't mold, He took our pizza right awy and made us a fresh batch before we can even observe it even more.  With all our time wasted, they gave us our bill and expected some sort of compensation for our time wasted by our incompetent waitress, but my fiancé ended up paying for the whole bill.

Oh and are you Victorian, a garage, or a Sport bar? Pick one. Redic decor.  Can I give zero stars, Yelp? I HATE this place. HATE. H-A-T-E.... This one, the Oakridge location, and Concord.

Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,549,286,5.0,8/19/2011,"I went here with my three daughters and met up with my friend and her son for lunch today. Our kids ranged from ages 3-7 years old. We arrived at about 2:30, so we were seated right away.  We were busy catching up with each other, instead of looking at the menu. Our waiter came by almost right after we were seated and took our drink orders. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was so good!  I ordered the deep dish bbq chicken pizza, my friend ordered one of the flat bread pizzas, the kids ordered chicken strips, corn dogs and grilled cheese all with french fries.  I'm not usually one to order pizza, if there are a lot of other options. But I felt like pizza, the pictures looked good, so I went for it. I'm glad I did because it was amazing! The dough on the deep dish was so good, it tasted like fresh baked bread. The bbq sauce was good and they used just enough and it was loaded with chicken and cheese. The kids meals price includes the entree and drink. The portion was actually pretty large for a kids meal. But mine didn't mind, they loved the french fries.  Our waiter was nice and attentive. The only thing is that he brought out the wrong flat bread pizza for my friend. My friend really wouldn't have noticed, but he came out and told her that he brought her the wrong pizza. He did give her the right one (on the house), she had a bite of one piece and then took the rest home. But other than that, he was good with keeping our drinks full and making sure we had everything we needed. I didn't think the overall price for what we ordered was bad. It was really good food, I'm sad that we don't live closer or we'd be visiting more often. But this is a restaurant that I wouldn't mind taking a 25 minute drive to dine at. And next time I'll make sure to save room to get a pazooki.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=200

Ariel C.,"Merced, CA",80,8,,1.0,8/9/2015,"I'm here to complain about the service, the food was great, satisfying as always. Although the service was terrible, the worst by far that I've ever experienced. I wish I remembered his name but he didn't ever introduce himself like a proper waiter would have. It took him about 20mins to take our drink order another 15 for them to come out. Then another 15 to take our order, keep in mind there are only myself and another in the party. So a total of 2 and it took a total of 50 mins to get our late lunch started. I believe he took the opportunity to judge us as being the young couple that would be less generous in the end tip,because he continued to avoid us, avoid eye contact, avoid refilling our drinks. He continued to serve his larger parties, no hesitation but it took us to turn our heads and raise our hands to get any of his attention. But there was no hesitation to rush us out of his section because he continuously ask if the bill was ready to be taken care of, while we were still enjoying our dessert. Not sure if he thought we'd dine and dash or was about to clock out but any server should know if a check is ready to be taken care of, then it'd be on the edge of the table or standing up. Like I said I wished we remembered his name but this mishap took place on Sunday the 9th of August around 4pm and we're  seated on the second row of two top booths farthest from the bar, fourth booth down.

Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,106,41,1.0,8/18/2015,"BJ's food is good.. Nothing spectacular, but it's good. So our food that we got was good. I can't complain about the quality of that.  So it's a Sunday night. The place is decently busy but it seems like everyone around us is getting their food and not having any problems. There is an ample amount of waiters and bus boys so this isn't a situation of being understaffed.  We order our food with this great waiter, and then someone else comes over and tells us he's taking over and the other guy is going on break. Whatever. Think nothing of it.  This guy was not necessarily rude... But not nice or pleasant at all. No smiles. Only business and there to get the job done. Which is fine! But don't expect a tip for your lack of service.  Our food comes out.... 45 minutes later- everything except for my friends soup..  - and our waiter comes over and tell us ""your soup will be right out! They're finishing it."" 5 minutes goes by... He comes by again at least three more times ""your soup will be out in two minutes!"" 5 minutes later- ""they're pouring it and giving it to me now"" - 10 minutes later- finally she gets her soup.  Also, it took 10 minutes for my friend to get her ranch. That she asked for with her meal order. Then asked for when we got our food. Then it finally came- after he walked by at least four times to do other things- with my friends soup.  So it's an hour after we've sat, and we didn't take too long to order- it was relatively normal timing. Anyway, so we get that. Then we order some dessert. A pazookie! We get that 25 minutes later. And then finally the guy comes by with our checks.  I should have asked for the manager sooner but I didn't want to stir the pot and was wishful thinking, having some hope in BJ's. But I finally did and he gave us some free pazookie certificates. But it was my fault that I spoke to the manager after our bills were paid.  But our service was just so terrible. I'm only in Modesto twice a year and for 2 days at a time. I don't want to waste my time sitting at BJ's, waiting for the damn waiter who keeps lying to us about the soup! Fine, if it's going to take longer, don't tell us ""2 minutes."" Be honest. And apologize about it.  We were there for a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes. As a party of four. The table that had 7 across from us came after us, had dinner and dessert just as we did-left before us. They had a different waiter.   I don't know if I'll return to BJ's.

I would truly rate at 2.5 stars, but since that's not available I figured I'd go with 2 (hoping somebody who can make a difference will notice). I like the food, but the service is painfully slow and inadequate. Last time we were there we ordered the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps, which are just a little bit on the messy side, and the server didn't bring any plates, we tried to flag down a couple other servers, but apparently we were in stealth mode because they were unable to notice us, so finally my wife got up to ask the person who was at the little desk near the restrooms, then about 5 minutes later they finally bring some plates.  Then we had issues getting silverware and napkins and eventually got 3 settings for the 4 of us to share, no joke! It's always the same experience.   I wish they would get it together there because BJ's has a great atmosphere, the food is decent, and the vanilla cream soda is wicked good!  So if you work at BJ's and happen to read this, please, please do something to improve the service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=220

Food is always great and the decor is awesome. Looks very modern and I love all the tv's and chandeliers. Been here with the hubby a lot and he loves it as well. Been here with some girlfriends for lunch and dinner plus birthdays so this is an all around versatile restaurant for any occasion. Food wise, thin cut fries are the best! Sounds ridiculous to rave about something as simple as fries but they're awesome. White cheddar mashed potatoes are tasty as well. Hand breaded parm is delicious and well as their broccolli and chicken pasta. What I love is that no matter what you get whether it be a sandwich or a steak, the presentation is beautiful. My FAVORITE thing to eat here is the Pazooki! The red velvet is the best but they don't have it anymore so instead I get the white macadamia pazookie which is delicious!! Chicken tortilla soup is amazing. Pizza flatbread is good but enough to share between 2. If you're a group of 4 or more you'll get one thin small piece a person. Burgers are great they look amazing like the picture. Pizza is very popular there as well.  Service isn't bad. Its like anywhere else, it just depends. Most of the time I get great service with the exception of 1 time but management did a great job of redeeming themselves. Thats the great thing about bjs. They really care about your experience.

Danny H.,"Atlanta, GA",9,408,38,3.0,5/23/2012,"The 14-year old in me was cruising down Rte. 99 on my way to Modesto to see a minor league baseball team called ""The Nuts,"" when the hunger struck.  I'd say I whipped out the trust ol' smartphone, but I'm a responsible driver, so I made my friend do it instead.  As a rule of thumb when traveling, try nothing you can get at home - and when the name ""BJ's"" came up, the 14-year old said to say no more, that's where we're going. It didn't occur to me that Beej's was a regional chain until after the visit, but the point remains is that it was new to me, and that was all that really mattered.  The Modesto location is conveniently located immediately off of Route 99, as part of a shopping mall.  That being said, parking is often predicated on the time of day, and/or the demand of something at the mall.  Considering the parking lot was completely packed when I got there, I wonder what alternatives there are to do in Modesto.  Needless to say, there's plenty of parking spaces, but being shared with a mall, it may or may not be an easy plight in finding a spot to actually park. Regardless, I must have gotten there at a perfect time; it was a Saturday afternoon at around 5:00 pm, so I'm guessing I was literally just arriving moments before the dinner rush was to begin.  So, in spite of what other reviewers mentioned about long wait times, I was seated promptly by a pretty hostess who seemed oddly interested in the weather in Atlanta upon chatting with me for a moment. Service was prompt and attentive, and more than willing to give suggestions and field my questions about their house brews.  I'm no expert on beer by any means, but I like to drink what refreshes my pallet so to speak, and because I have a fascination with buffalos, I ended up going with their Tatonka stout.  It was a bit sweeter than say a Guinness, but it wasn't as thick.  That being said, it went down smooth, and could be a brew that I could easily thrown back several before knowing what hit me. As for the food, I ordered the fish tacos.  Actually, they were kind enough to do a one-and-one for me, and give me one of the chargrilled mahi-mahi and one chargrilled shrimp.  The shrimp taco was a little on the bland side, but the mahi-mahi taco was excellent.  A good amount of flavor and sauce, without totally drowning out the taste of the meat itself.  I made the mistake of eating the mahi-mahi first.  It was served with chips and dip on the side. The price of my entire experience was nothing really out of the ordinary.  They're not expensive to where it's worth complaining, and they're not so cheap to warrant talking about.  If I ever head back up to the NorCal or Modesto areas, I'd gladly give Beej's more business, as I'd like to go and sample all their house brews, as well as their in-house root beer and cream soda.  Easily worth making a repeat trip or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=240

I was not to be disappointed.  Well, I wasn't -- as I was.  To say the least about BJ's: they are consistent. We could hardly hear ourselves think as we sat in the cacophony of bar noise, news shows, and a few competing basketball and baseball games -- especially that from the loudspeakers of the establishment across the courtyard. The pizza looked okay, but like a photograph of a real pizza, it lacked real flavor, especially the tomato sauce.  Nothing remarkable about it other than its price.   The pizza was colder than the beer. My culinary companion du jour's salad looked like the oldest lettuce in Modesto.  After she picked out the few good bits from her salad, then she noshed on my cold pizza.   Cold pizza is the best, right? she asked... Fickle girl.

After waiting for 20 minutes to be seated we sat and odered our food and got flat pepsi while we waited for our appetizer. Cold, overcooked calamari and fried artichokes that were pure squish! I asked the waitress if they were canned or something because who would fry canned artichokes right?!?! She giggles and said ""wow, how'd you know""! Our salads came next with no dressing (I ordered ranch with extra on the side) my salad was not green, it was a completely yellow wedge... Then I asked for dressing and we watched the waiter who delivered our food walk away, go bus a few tables, go drink some water and flirt with a girl in the computer area. So my man got up to ask him again if he was going to get my ranch since I couldn't the eat salad sitting in front of me. He said ""yeah, I'll get to it""... We had to ask two other people before I finally got it. About an hour after we order and still no entree, a manager comes and apologizes for the Long wait, our waitress hasn't said a word. I didn't want to complain about what had been going on and further ruin our night out at this point. The food comes next and we don't have extra plates or silverware (we were sharing each others food) so we say until it was cold about ten minutes later before someone brought silverware...Terrible service, terrible food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=240

Ever hear of heavy cream and real cheese people.  Service was scripted like every other chain, so dont expect any personality from your server because its obvious it must be against corporate rules. Obviously from watching other tables complain it occurred to me this is a chain that goes for massive sales, comping complainers and at the end somehow ink out a profit.  I recommend staying away from this place and going to an independent for your family night out.  It can't be worse and likely much cheaper.

Mehndi M.,"Modesto, CA",49,258,271,2.0,9/13/2014,"REVIEW BASED OFF CATERING EXPERIENCE! Last weekend, I had my birthday party food catered from BJ's. It was pretty simple to do. I just went into the restaurant a few hours before my party and went to the take-out area to order it. I chose to order the Family & Friends Party Pack, $99.95. I added on the appetizer package as well for $33.95. The Family & Friends Pack serves about 10 people. It includes: 2 large Pizzas, 10 pieces of Balsamic Glazed Chicken Breast, 2 large Specialty or Enlightened Salads, 20 Chicken Wings, and 4 Party Sides. The Appetizer Package included two appetizers of your choice. I picked the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. I was VERY disappointed by all my catering.  When my boyfriend went to pick up all the food, they charged him for everything but they didn't put the Appetizer Package in any of the bags. He had to wait another 30 mins for them to make that which made him late bringing the food for the party while our guests had already arrived. That was MISTAKE #1. I had a few religiously, vegetarian guests therefore I ordered a vegetarian pizza and a vegetarian salad. When we served the food, someone noticed that there were small chunks of chicken in the VEGETARIAN salad!! How bad would that have been if my aunt who has been vegetarian for about 50 years ate meat for the first time because of a screw-up from BJ's?! MISTAKE #2. For the 4 Party Sides, we ordered two mashed potatoes, one of the baked potato option, and one rice pilaf. When we opened the Party Size Sides, we were in shock. The so called ""party sides"" that are supposed to be enough for 6-10 people were so ridiculously small! The two sides of mashed potatoes were like the smallest size of mashed potatoes you get from KFC (like the size of an ice cream scoop). How on earth does that feed 6-10 people?! The rice pilaf was of the same size. MISTAKE #3. Then we opened the box with the baked potatoes that were supposed to feed 6-10 people....it was ONE baked potato. How does ONE potato feed 6-10 people?! MISTAKE #4. When we opened the Mix & Match Appetizer and I quote from their website ""serves approx. 6-8 people"" ....the Spinach & Artichoke dip was SMALLER than a kid's size ice cream scoop from Baskin Robbins!! Explain to me BJ's how that can feed 6-8 people. The Avocado Egg Rolls were 3 egg rolls cut in half, making 6 pieces. MISTAKE #5.  For the amount of money we paid for all this food, it was not worth it at all. Glad I know now though! I called to let them know about all these problems especially about the vegetarian mistake and the manager sent me a $15 gift card for the $140 we spent on their food.

I cannot believe the attitude of my waitress and how long just getting drinks took my party and I. It took over a half hour just to get the check and my change. She had the audacity to take her rudeness to another level through being sarcastic as we were talking amongst ourselves about how long it was taking. I couldn't be any less pleased, as this was the third and final time I will have horrible service from BJ's. It must stand for 'big Joke' in terms of service. I was so irate I couldn't even speak to the manager of the service for fear of losing my temper.

Brook G.,"Beaverton, OR",0,80,1,2.0,1/17/2015,"Let me first start out by saying that today's disaster could have been avoided if BJ's had ANY decent low-carb options on their menu. Even their salads have things like beans and corn and breaded chicken. Anything you order must be altered in order to get it to be a low carb meal. However, I have never been to this BJ's and been able to order a single thing (even non-low-carb) with a specialty (even just swapping the type of dressing on a salad or a side of anchovies with a pizza) without having an issue.  Apparently this BJ's specifically has a problem with specialty orders. Today, for example, I ordered the Toasted Turkey Bacon Sandwich. I ordered it on lettuce instead of bread, provolone instead of swiss, and no tomato. It came with a salad, so I ordered the salad with no tomato and no croutons.  The sandwich (now a lettuce wrap) came to me looking like they had thrown it together with spite because I had asked for it to be a special order. Then, I found that it had no mayo (it is supposed to come with it) and no cheese, on top of it looking disheveled. It also came with a side of ranch, which I couldn't figure out because I had not ordered that and the salads always come pre-dressed. My husband and I have been to many BJ's locations and have always been pleased with our service and our food, however we have been to this Modesto location several times and every single time they have messed up a specialty order, even if it is just ""add grilled chicken to my pasta"" or something simple like that.  I also had to ask for my salad twice after my main dish came, and each time I specified no croutons, no tomato. When I finally got it, it had tomato, which I picked off and ate without complaint because it was such a big deal that they finally got at least half of something right. Our server was nice about everything, although she could have avoided the comment about how ""I could have just ordered a salad as a meal"" because she clearly has not ever looked at the nutritional info of their menu.  I can't figure out if the wait staff just forgets because they never write anything down, the kitchen staff is angry and spiteful because of a picky order (sorry, there are people who have special dietary needs which BJ's fails to cater to!), or if the kitchen staff is on autopilot and never gets a special order correct because they don't know how to break pattern.  I won't be coming back to this location. I know from experience that a customer's picky order can be frustrating, but it is also frustrating for a customer to have to sit down at their favorite restaurant and not be able to order their favorite meal because of new health restrictions. I also hope that BJ's some day comes out with a couple of low carb options on their menu. It would be much easier than trying to customize an order and dealing with frustrated staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=280

We ordered a variety of things from the menu. One person ordered a sandwich, two people ordered steak, one person ordered from the kids menu, and one person ordered a pasta. It took an unusually long time to get our food which seemed odd being the restaurant wasn't that crowded yet, but someone did come to the table and apologized for the wait. Food overall was good. Portion size generally matched the price the price point, except for the steaks which were severely undersized for the price point. (We ordered a New York and sirloin). The weight on the menu for the New York steak is deceiving. It states the steak is a 16oz, but is bone in, which means much of the weight is attributed to the bone. This is not restaurant industry standard for a New York cut. The sirloin didn't list a size on the menu, but when it came to the table, it looked like a 6 oz. Very disappointing. For the price point, we were expecting a piece of meat about double in size. We felt misled. Side portions with the steak dishes were very small for the price point. Waiter was attentive, however. Atmosphere was good, albeit slightly noisy.  Bathrooms and restaurant in general was clean.  It is a good place to have a meal, you just have to avoid certain menu items. I would recommend avoiding the steak section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=280

Michael K.,"Berkeley, CA",343,20,8,1.0,1/6/2013,"This was literally the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I went with a group of 4 friends at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. We were given a half hour wait, which I had expected. Our buzzer rang at 9 and I thought that this meant they were ready for us. The waitress told us to wait at the side. Many groups after us were instructed to do so and subsequently given tables before us, until almost the whole waiting area had been cleared - which made it seem like they forgot about us. After 10 more minutes we were finally given a seat. Once we sat down a waitress told us she'll be right there and placed one drink napkin on the table (um, what?), but it did take more time before she actually came back. We ordered 2 Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo's, 1 Chicken Marsala, 1 club sandwich. The final person wanted to try to loaded baked potato. Before ordering, he wanted to know why just a baked potato was $8.00 and a menu category. The waitress assured him it was plenty of food (there's a point to this later on). She memorized it (cue signs of something bound to go wrong) and was off. We waited another half hour for our food, which I initially thought was fine. But then the food came. The two Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo's came without bread, with the waiter remarking that they were making more and would be brought out shortly. My friend's ""giant"" loaded potato was normal sized and obviously not enough for a full meal. I thought my meal would be the only one that worked, but then I cut into my chicken. It was COMPLETELY RAW aside from the outside. Disgusted, I called the waitress over - she quickly apologized and brought it back to the kitchen. My friend then called over a menu and ordered a bowl of clam chowder to add to his obvious unfulfilling potato. I then waited another 20 minutes for my food to be returned. My two other friends finished their pasta's - but they never got the bread that the waiter said he was bringing (didn't see that one coming). While I was waiting, another waiter brought my friend a cup of clam chowder - which he then had to ask another waiter to fix because he had, like I said, ordered a bowl. Their fix? They brought out another cup of clam chowder claiming that two cups were equivalent to one of their bowls (by this point, I was having trouble believing them). Then, finally, they returned my Chicken Marsala with another apology. Fortunately, it tasted fine; unfortunately, I was the only one of our group of 5 now eating. Then, when I was almost finished, they brought out the bread he had promised 45 minutes ago. We finished our meal with a pizookie trio. They gave us our check once we had finished the dessert, and I noticed there were very few people sitting around us. The time read 10:45pm - 2 hours and 15 minutes after we had originally came to BJs. I'm fine with waiting, but that seems a little extreme. Oh, and did I mention that they billed us for my raw chicken dish? I'm not one to complain about  waiting or prices, because both of these things can't be controlled by the staff. But I'm giving 1 star because literally anything that they could have done wrong to us happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=300

Unlimited soup & salad for $8 not a bad deal Monday-Friday until 3PM. Recently, I've been here and the bartender, Lindsey, was amazing! It wasn't too crowded at the actual bar around 1PM but all the other tables in the bar area were occupied. She was real attentive to me and the 3 other guys at the bar. She was witty and made nice small chat with each of us. That was nice!  Dinner time and weekends its rough! Busy and not the best service sometimes.

Shreya G.,"Fremont, CA",27,169,184,5.0,12/22/2010,"I want to give this BJ's 4.5 stars. I'm only giving a -0.5 because their floors are so clean I pretty much almost slipped and caused a scene.  It was noon, 12 on the dot, and my mother and I walk into BJ's hoping for a nice, sit-down lunch. Every single table was filled. I've been to many BJ's locations, and this particular restaurant was almost twice the size of the ones that I have been to. We were seated very quickly at a mini booth, where we were quickly served drinks (water). Within five minutes, we had a waitress coming to us and asking us what we wanted, and we ordered the endless soup and salad for 6.95. Within three minutes, we already had our salads and soups on the table. This is what I call fast service!  My mother and I are enjoying our meals and as we finish our salad, our wonderful waitress walks by and ask us if we are ready for our next salad.  What? She asked us if we were ready? How amazing is that? At the BJ's in Cupertino, flagging down a waitress for a fork was a big deal. Here, our waitress, who you can tell was trying very hard, was ready for us to receive our next salad and soup.  Throughout the whole meal, on target, as we finished our soup or our salad, our waitress was there to make sure that we received our next rounds in a timely manner. Did I also mention she asked me if I wanted my soup in a sourdough bread bowl? I had the tuscan tomato bisque in the bread bowl, and let me tell you, it was definitely worth the extra $2.  I really do wish I knew my waitress's name, but she was so lightning fast I couldn't see her name tag. She really was outstanding amongst all the other waiters and waitresses there, and even outstanding amongst other waiters and waitress that I have seen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=320

Jorgess M.,"Roseville, CA",198,268,166,1.0,7/17/2012,"The second BJ's I have ever been to and the first one in Roseville is awesome. I was excited to go to Modesto with my boyfriend to go shopping and to actually eat here. It was between this or Buffalo Wild Wings right in front, unfortunately BJ's won. I regret it now....  Walked in, hostess told us it'll be about a couple minutes because they're still cleaning up our table. So we stood there, awkwardly, with her just staring at us, and awkward.... We finally got to our table and long story short....  Service:  Waitress came off as rude, but I didn't wanna judge her right away, however, throughout our lunch I realized she really was just rude. My boyfriend is a pretty chill and nice person, who doesn't get bothered by anyone, but this fool just rubbed him the wrong way. She seriously just ignored everything about us. We put our glasses at the edge of the table so she can see that we need refills but still nothing for about fifteen minutes until my boyfriend finally decided to ask her. The craziest thing at the end of our lunch happened too (as if we didn't already hate her), we asked for more refills and she filled it up HALFWAY!!!!! WTF!!?? Seriously!? Food: Their pizza didn't really help our experience either. We ordered a medium great white and that was lame. Barely any sauce which made the whole pizza extremely blah, and the chicken was as dry as the desert, so that was probably one of the worst pizzas I've had (Digiorno Pizza is better). We also ordered calamari and that was even worse. The presentation was horrible!!!! Horrible I say! It looks like it came from a frozen meal, the whole thing was falling apart, and it tasted like it was just microwaved, no crunchiness to it whatsoever, or just anything.

Minus the fact that it wasn't busy and we waited over an hour for our food, we got our drinks well after our appetizer came out. Our waitress was not the best and her attitude seemed somewhere else rather than to the customer. The food this time was just okay, and our food came out one plate at a time and 10 mins apart!! We ordered clam chowder in a bread bowl and at first they brought it out in a bowl, then we told them that we ordered the bread and the boy (not our waiter) we extreme nice about it, but the surprise came when we got it back, they reduced the size of the BOWL of soup to a cup. I have never seen clam chowder in such a little portion before. They said they use a ""new device"" to make the hole in the bread.. The new ""device"" seems more to me like the top of a cup..

Service can be pretty uneven though.  Today as I write this we have an awesome server but there have been times when the service has been quite poor.  I also find it a tad too loud.  With the loud music and the high ceilings sound just echos and echoes, so it isn't a place to go for quiet conversation.  Its like part sports bar and part brew pub, but it doesn't have the energy of a sports bar or the coziness of a pub.

Chris N.,"Knights Ferry, CA",0,71,3,4.0,9/13/2013,"I really like this location - Great quality and service. The four star rating is based on their lunch menu deals. - A lot of great food, at a low price. The first lunch - Half a stuffed potato (a *large* half) and their house salad. Friend had the personal deep-dish pizza and Caesar salad. Really good, and inexpensive to boot. Second lunch - We both had the unlimited soup and salad. There were five salads and five soups to choose from. The day's special salads were excellent - One was sliced tomato/buffalo mozzarella cheese salad with a great vinaigrette, and the other was a watermelon and feta cheese salad. I also tried their wedge salad, which had thick-sliced bacon and chopped tomatoes over chunky blue cheese dressing. (The other two choices were house and Caesar, which I had before and were fresh and tasty).  The Chicken Tortilla soup is great. They bring out a bowl with fresh avocado, cheddar cheese and crisp tortilla strips and then pour the chicken soup into the bowl there at the table. It comes with a nice lime wedge, and all of the flavors together are SO GOOD. The clam chowder is almost like a ""stew,"" incredibly thick and just the right potato/clam ratio. Delicious. The chili was great, and I can't speak for the other two soups as I was too full to order another dish.  All of this, for only $7.50.

So, when 5 minutes gone by, and still no one came. We sat ourselves at the bar nearby. We waved it off. We, too, owned a restaurant. We know how it feels like to be busy. In fact, we just closed it down, and came to BJs for a late dinner. (Had to point that out to prove we can relate :D) We waited for you to take our orders, but after many servers walked passed by.. We finally flagged one down ourselves. Awesome. After we got our drinks, we waited for our appetizers.. And after we finished our appetizers.. We waited to order our entrees. We asked for forks and spoons 3 times after appetizers. Then we realized, we weren't the only customers that waited a bit too long for the order to take place, the food to get to the table, etc. When you were caught up between our table and another table, you didn't bother telling us to that you'll be back.  Yes, you did come back, but I still find that extremely rude that you turned away from us without explanation. A simple one wouldn't hurt. My cousins reassured me that this is normal, you guys are slow. Forget the food. Food's not enjoyable when servers dampens your mood. Customer service do matter.

I'm obviously a frequent customer at curbside and there's only been 2 instances where my service was just terrible to say the least. When you order through the app, you get a link to do a survey after you've received your food. I normally give high ratings and praise for everything so when those 2 separate times came around and my rating was lower than normal, the managers listened! I did not expect any kind of monetary gain from the surveys (and honestly doubted anyone read them) but when I informed them each separate time about the bad service through those surveys, I got a curtesy gift card and apology from the manager.

So while we are waiting I notice our waitress leaning on the wall with her head resting on the wall as well. Completely unprofessional. After she took our order she went on break. Our new waitress brought our drinks and my cousins was diet when she ordered regular. They brought her another diet to replace it. Finally on the 3rd try they got it right. Then we get our food except for my aunt. All three of us were done eating and my aunt still hadn't got her food. We ask about it and turns out that they just forgot to cook it but were cooking it then. The manger brought it out and apologized but did not offer any discount.

We explained that we weren't looking for a free drink, we were simply asking for what we paid for to be replaced. She spoke with a manager, he/she said no. I asked for her to speak with the head manager, and apparently the head manager said no also - stating that again, ""they don't give free drinks"". Are you serious? She was trying to walk with a cocktail to the table and dropped it. Where's the customer service? Maybe the server or hostess should take the drinks from the bar to the table for their guests.

He was wonderful & helpful & the only one who went out of his way for his customers. I am a regular customer to BJ's but this was my first time at this location & the worse restaurant experience ever!! Everything was just ridiculous. I went in tonight for dinner, my last night before I head home tomorrow, & was met with a horrible, horrible experience. The food, the manager, the food AGAIN, then the manager AGAIN! I came into dinner with a party of 4 including myself, & we were seated promptly. Orders taken & everything in an orderly fashion. My first complaint is that one of the orders, their famous rib eye steak, was literally half fat. I understand that it's a fatty type of steak, but for half of the steak to have that much fat, we weren't paying $20 for fat. So the server replaces it with the new york steak because it's leaner, & that was charred. Burned. Inedible. However we weren't going to wait an additional 20 minutes for another awful steak. Then a manager, named Paul (just Paul since he refused to give us his last name) passed by with a ""oh, your new steak is here"" without even caring to stop. Just passed by. After all of that, I ordered my pizookie, because at this point that's the only thing that could make this AWFUL experience tolerable. & after a few bites, I find a sharp piece of plastic, in my mouth. I ask for the manager once again, & the only thing she offers me is a guest complaint sheet. What good is that to me at the moment?!

After the orders were taken half of our party received there entrees while it took another 10-15 minutes for the rest of us to be served. One poor guy didn't receive his food until the rest of us were done eating. And as an additional slap in the face it took them over 45 minutes to bring us our checks.

So I call ahead, which is a great option, and they tell me it'll be an hour and 40mins- perfect because my dad was still watching the game. We get in, I let the greeter know my name and everything and she says one moment....5minutes go buy and I check on everything, I guess she put me in as someone else and forgot about me-at this point she seats us right away-kinda annoying, but it was quick in the end. So we sit, I order a mojito and a 1/2pb 1/2chocolate chunk pizookie to share- telling them we're here to celebrate my birthday with a delish dessert. The mojito comes out and it is HORRIBLE-gag- I think the soda was flat or something but it was so sweet I could hardly drink it. Then 15 minutes goes buy and we still don't have dessert! I was shocked- finally almost 20 minutes after ordering my pizookie comes...sans candle! WTF! Okay, thanks for acknowledging my day...ugh. So this AM I called BJs up and asked if they did anything for birthdays- I was informed they give out a free birthday pizookie and put a candle on it...hm...problem...cus I had no candle and mine wasn't free!

Last visit, it took 10 minutes to take my order at the bar and another 10 minutes to get my ""on tap"" beer.

The hostess and the waitress were both really sweet and friendly which is always a plus.  The menu was fairly expansive, although definitely nowhere near the selection of Cheesecake Factory.  The only reason I bring up the comparison is that I heard several people say how BJ's had the largest menu they had ever seen.   I settled on the turkey burger with all white meat.  The burger was so thin and the meat was so tightly compact it appeared to be a processed turkey burger.  The burger was grilled and all I could taste was the blackened grill marks on the meat.  Hello carcinogens!  I did have a yummy raspberry lemon drop (delish) which made up for my sad little burger.   I would not rule BJ's out.  I would like to come back and try the pizza which they are supposedly known for.  Hopefully the food will be better next time!  Three stars for yummy cocktails and friendly service.  ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=440
Reg E.,Bay Area,45,81,9,2.0,12/24/2010,"Bjs is pretty much your average chain restaurant that serve your basic appetizers, burgers, salads, pastas and some other random shit.  The ambiance is the same as any other-they all look alike.  It's the service that sets them apart. I came here on a late Monday night and it was pretty empty.  The hostess tried to seat us in this lonely dark corner away from the few people that were in the restaurant.  Well, this area was too dark for my little one so I asked to be moved.  I pointed to a booth in the middle part of the  restaurant where life was actually taking place and she replied with, ""that section is closed off... there's no server"".  As she was finishing up her sentence I see this guy seat a couple at the table I wanted to sit at?!!? WTF?? I looked at her and she said, ""oh, he's going to be serving them.""  That shit made no sense to me... I was still standing there waiting for her to seat us somewhere and she points to a table allllll the way on the other side- another lonely corner- but I agreed to it because there was more lighting. We were greeted almost immediately by a bubbly waiter who was extremely nice and friendly.  He offered us a drink and waited patiently at the table while we sat and tried to decide.  We took a while and I was thinking how awkward it must have been for him, but he stood there and didn't make us feel rushed so that's a plus. We ordered: 1.) Crisp potato skin platter ($8.95)- this was ok.  It tastes like baked potato topped with pieces of bacon, cheese, and chives.  It was served with a side of sour cream and ranch. 2.) CA burger ($9.95)- avocado, green chiles, pepper jack on sourdough bread.  BF ordered his burger rare and added a side wedge salad for an extra $2.95.  Pretty simple salad with tomatoes, ranch and bacon bits.   3.) Ahi poki ($8.75)- ahi, onions, avocado with wonton chips.  This one was alright.  They put too many chips (which i didn't care for) and not enough tuna. 4.) Sweet pig pizza SM (11.95)- pineapple, tomatoes, ham. 5.) Gourmet Mac & cheese (3.95)- pasta with cheese baked with bread crumbs or something.  My daughter ordered this and liked it.  I didn't try it. 6.) Classic burger ($8.95)- thousand island dressing, toasted bun, meat. 7.) Pazookie($5.95)- chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Ehhhh.. The cookie tasted undercooked. Anyway, the food is pretty basic, theres really nothing special about them, and my experience here sucked because of it: 1.) My BFs CA burger came out cooked the way he asked but it was burnt on the outside.  It tasted like they didn't clean the grill before they slapped on a new patty.  This didn't fly with him so he pushed it to the side.  The waiter noticed this and asked if everything was ok.  We told him what was wrong with it and he offered to make another.  We were afraid it'd come out the same but he assured us the grill was just cleaned. 2.) My BF ordered the classic burger in replacement of his burnt CA burger.  You can tell the grill was cleaned but his meat was freaking cooked well-done.  Come on, server... He ordered it blue the first time around.  He ended up passing on this one too because the meat was cooked too much for him to enjoy it. 3.) They brought out a kids Mac for my daughter when she had asked for the mini gourmet Mac.  They changed it without problem but by the time it came out we were almost done with our food. 4.) Their pizza is supposed to be really good here but mine came out freaking cold with an extremely soggy crust.  It really tasted like it was sitting out before they decided to bring it to me.  I didn't enjoy this dish at all and with all that was going on with my daughters gourmet Mac, my BFs burnt patty, and then overcooked burger... I didn't even want to bother about my pizza.   This dining experience was a huge disappointment and I really felt like I wasted my money because everything that came out was crap after crap.  I don't get it?!?! I give this place two stars because our server was patient with us and he did not express any rudeness or discontent with our complaints. ***I should have read the yelps before I suggested BJs but we were doing some shopping at the mall and this place is at a damn prime location.  We also finished up pretty late and BJs is open til 12am so it worked.  Thank goodness for us we didn't have a rude server because that along with the shit food they sent out would've sent me over the top for sure!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=440

Kristin P.,"Riverbank, CA",202,194,52,4.0,8/19/2008,"SO I finally tried BJ's after my friend Kelly has been talking it up since it opened. I went on my lunch break from work with a co worker, so I unfortunately wasn't able to try the beer...which sucks since I'm a big fan of beer! The service was pretty prompt after we sat down...a bit too promp because we had no sooner opened our menu, and our waiter was ready to take out order so we told him to come back...one minute later...um, we aren't ready. Geez, can you give us a minute we thought. SO, when we were finally ready, he didn't come back for like ten minutes! But, I'm not really writing to complain about him, I'm just telling you what happened. He was actually a very good server for the most part, our waters were filled regularly, he suggested the lunch portion of what we were ordering because we would get more food and it would be cheaper. One more thing he did do though was bring us the wrong check...when I saw the coffee on the bill, I knew it belonged to the group of old ladies behind us...(since its a universal fact that old people will drink coffee even if its 100 degree outside). And when we finally got the right check, it took him about ten minutes to get back to us with the change! Anyway, we both ordered the California Chicken Sandwich, which came with Avocado (SOLD!), grilled chicken, chipotle mayo, grilled peppers, and pepper jack cheese. With the lunch portion it came with a half sandwich, wedge cut fries, and a salad wedge. Neither my co-worker nor I like blue cheese so we were not too happy when the salad arrived covered in blue cheese crumbles...we should have asked. Oh well, we ate it anyway and surprisingly, I thought it was really good anyway. It was covered with a really yummy white garlic dressing, and I just picked around the cheese crumbles. The sandwich came on a garic-ey grilled sourdough which I could have eaten alone, it was so good! CO worker raved about it. The sandwich itself though was a bit soggy due to too much chipotle mayo so In the future I;d request lite or none at all. Last but not least, the fries were great too! And all in all, the portion was very adequate. And it was about $7 for all of it! I can't wait to go back and try the beer when I'm not on the clock!  And as for the waiter, he was really pleasant, and I could tell he meant well, all his minor mistakes aside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=440

Julia N.,"Elk Grove, CA",1303,601,65,4.0,11/29/2008,"Had a great salad here called the ""Santa Fe."" It was the perfect mix of greens, fixin's and dressing. Usually, one of three scenarios happens when I order a salad as a meal:  1. Way too many greens and no fixin's (e.g. no corn, avocado, ya know...the good stuff...the stuff you're actually paying for).  2. Way too many fixin's and no greens. When this occurs I feel like sending it back and ordering a double cheeseburger with bacon because I may as well; the calories I will consume will be about the same.  3. WAY too much dressing; a sea of dressing if you will. The lettuce has soaked in a long hot bath of dressing and now resembles cooked spinach covered in mayonnaise.  My point?

They do (which I should try) have a take out menu that can be utilized and they even have on-line ordering. They have some really great lunch specials ($5.95 for a mini pizza and side salad or chicken sticks and fries, etc.), but since I was late back to work it cost me a little more than that.

Evonne T.,"Modesto, CA",8,39,5,4.0,8/25/2008,"Okay, so I wasn't really excited about getting another restaurant near the mall. Don't get me wrong- I love food and more than loving food, I love to eat!! But I think more than loving to eat is my love for shopping and with a huge restaurant slab in the middle of the mall parking lot, made me nervous. I already have a hard time finding mall parking, what if there was no where to park in the middle of my shopping spree, would I (gasp) actually have to walk miles and miles in the snow with no shoes....So, I went there with full intentions on picketing and was drawn in by that interesting revolving door that looks like the one at my dr's office. The wait was 45 minutes but it went fast, we memorized the menu while we waited. The staff was nice, the hostess talkative (think I learned her whole life story in the brief walk to our table) but the waitress looked stressed out and didn't once crack a smile.  In her defence, it was very busy and she was good.  She was probably just wondering how on earth she was going to be able to serve all the tables she was assigned to. We ordered Stuffed Avacado Egg Rolls which were delicious- cream cheese, sweet onion, avacado, tomatos, beer battered fish and chips and BJ's speciality deep dish pizza. The food was very good plus they brew their own root beer with endless refills. Yum!~  The inside is very well decorated (reminds me of the Venetian in Las Vegas) and there are TV's everywhere-perfect for football season.

I'm not a fan of the big-box equivalent of restaurants, but I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service. I ordered the Field of Greens salad with grilled chicken and it was delicious.  Our table also ordered two pizzas; one was half and half of two of their pre-made pizzas while the other was a build-your-own style pizza. Stick to the pre-made ones because they come with tons of toppings and that's probably worth your money. The build-your-own pizza was skimpy on the toppings.  I also had my first encounter with the Buffalo Bite, a mix of their Cider and Stout beers. I forgot where I was for a second as I enjoyed this delicious concoction. Does anyone know what it's called at any other bar? It's 50/50 of cider and stout. But anyway, I digress... The waitress was a little fake, but she was good.

Corinne W.,"Hilo, HI",23,8,1,4.0,8/3/2009,"I've been to BJ's a handful of times and have never been disappointed. This restaurant is right next to the mall, so the high volume of business and the resulting wait times are pretty much a given, particularly during weekends and around dinnertime. If we know we're going to be in the area, we phone ahead. But we generally do this just about everywhere we go. I don't care if BJ's is a chain. The food is consistently really good here! Pizzas are yummy, pizookies are delish, pastas are great, stuffed potatoes are awesome (and HUGE) and the tomato bisque is to die for. Their beers aren't half bad either. Food here can get a little pricey for the younger crowd, but the lunch specials are incredible. Hubby and I can grab a large, satisfying lunch and a round of beers here on a weekday  for around $20. Service is okay, provided how busy this restaurant is. I've only had one bad experience with them (Ordered a wedge salad with no bacon, received one with bacon. Waited five minutes for waiter to come back, then another five minutes for new salad, only to realize that waiter had accidentally swiped my fork when he took the first salad. Had to wait another five minutes for waiter to return.) but it was a silly mistake, and definitely not enough to keep me from returning. The wait staff is friendly, and will do their best to correct any problems or mix-ups that may arise during your meal. Bottom line: If you can handle the wait, it's totally worthwhile. If not, phone ahead and get your food to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=460
D H.,"Modesto, CA",1,7,,1.0,7/25/2014,"If I could rate this place a zero, I would. The service is TERRIBLE from the minute you walk in the door. Last night was our daughter's birthday, she selected BJ's as the location for her BDay dinner. We were hoping for an enjoyable experience to celebrate the occasion. When we walked in, the hostess took our information and indicated about a 10 minute wait. Interestingly, several large parties (8 or more) were called to be seated before us. No problem, they probably called ahead. The annoying part was, for all - only 1 or 2 from their party was present when called. So......why seat them when you have others waiting. After 25 minutes we were seated. Once seated, we were there at least 15 minutes before anyone ever came to the table to greet us, take a drink order, or anything for that matter. Once the server came, she apologized for the delay...someone called in sic...blah blah blah. Don't care - that is the manager's responsibility to call someone else in. It happens in businesses all over the country. One in our party ordered a root beer. 10 minutes after other drinks were brought, the server told us she had to go to the bar to get the soda. Okay - so go get it! The time spent to come tell us could have been better utilized to get the beverage. It arrived after we inquired twice more. Meal arrived, asked for ketchup...three times. After the third time, the party next to us was kind enough to give us their bottle of ketchup. These kind of actions continued to happen throughout. Our bill comes - it has charges for items we didn't order. Server says she has to find a manager for the correction. 10 minutes later, comes back to tell us the register had a malfunction and she needs a manager to assist with reprinting the bill receipt. She finally comes back and....extra chargers are still on there. SERIOUSLY....ARE YOU DUMB OR WHAT?????????? 1 hour and 45 minutes later our meal was finished. I hope BJ's corporate reads this. The food is good, we have been to other locations and the service has been better. The MODESTO location needs assistance, new management, better hiring practices, or SOMETHING????? This isn't the first time the service has been poor in this location. I PROMISE I won't be back nor will I ever recommend this restaurant to anyone.

T Z.,"Modesto, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/6/2014,"I've never written a bad review before, but I am inclined to share this experience, for those of us that do not look all prim and proper. I chose to watch the Niner game at Bj's, as my family was gone for the day, due to a death in a friends family. It was chilly, but I decided to ride my motorcycle, to have a little therapy as well. There is no good parking for a bike at this location, and I always have to worry about it, but chose it because they have big tv's, good beer, and I always thought a decent breakfast menu, I used to meet friends from out of town here after church, because it's close to the freeway and aways has had friendly service. As I finally got a decent parking spot, not to far from the front, I went in and got lucky with a decent seat at the bar. I asked for a menu, and it was, I noticed, 1:07 pm.. I asked the bartender if breakfast was still being served, and she said NO, brerakfast ends at 1pm, (that was 7 minutes ago) I said in my head. Ok it is what it is, the eggs must blow up at 1, hell I don't know. I put my leather coat on the chair, and leather gloves on the bar. I kept stepping away from time to time by the bathroom where I could hear the phone calls about the arraingments for the friend of the familes loss, then periodically going outside to check on my bike. Leaving my EXPENSIVE LEATHER COAT on my chair, and gloves, while each time covering my drink with a napkin. Mind you I'm very polite, and ALWAYS say please and thank you, and respect the service industry greatly, I always tip very big for good service, sometimes 10 or 20 dollars on a small check, if I have the money, because I know that is their income, and it's not easy. I noticed the two ladies kind of whispering, and glancing at me a couple times, mind you, I didnt have a hoodie on, and I was pretty much occupying a space there. Now I didn't order a bunch of drinks, or steak and lobster, my bill was a whopping 13 dollars, when I stood up about 45 minutes in, during a commercial to go check on my bike, thats when mizz bartender (I'll leave her name out, as she will know if she sees this, and if the boss reads these and cares, they will figure it out) decides to say, in front of EVERYBODY there, a full bar. ""IF YOUR GOING TO KEEP GETTING UP FROM YOUR CHAIR, I'M GOING TO NEED A CARD FROM YOU"". I smiled and said ""I'm checking on my motorcycle, because you have no safe place to park it, and my $500 dollar leathers are right here at my spot, I don't think I'll be leaving them for a 13 tab"". I never said another word about it, although it did change my whole attitude, about the moment, the two service ladies, and the people around me spoke about it some throughout the game, IT WAS VERY UNCALLED FOR. I've been in customer service for years, and if she or those two, were not observant enough to see my big azz leather jacket on my chair, gloves and helmet to boot, please have the class to not call a customer out in front of several other patrons. I also had asked to sample the three light beers, and asked if they had anything besides breast's for chicken. Maybe this was too much extra questions for them I don't really know. The game was great, and she couldn't ruin the taste of the few  beers, or the kool people around me. When everyone cleared an hour or so later, I found the manager on duty, and thanked him for letting me park where he did, I never mentioned my experience, was very tempted, but just chose not too. I finished my beer, taking my time, because I, of course wanted to make sure I wasn't buzzed, she did fill up my water about 10 times, maybe that was too much, again, don't know.  I gave her my American Express, and took the time to write a big ZERO on the tip line. and wrote in. You shouldn't judge people by what they look like, and basically embarass them in front of everyone. I usually tip big, God Bless !! :-)....... I think what really hurt, was the fact that I was being very polite, and we were all talking about other local places, and I was just REALLY taken aback by being called out like pond scum over a 13 dollar bill. It only cost her 10 bucks,s my bill was 29 dollars when all was said and done, but i all adds up, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one, ya never are. Moral: pay attention, if I was going outside with my leather jacket and helmet on, then maybe she would have had concern, or better yet, make a policy to give a card when the tab is started. DON'T EVER CALL GOOD PATRONS OUT, BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU NOW IT WILL COST YOU HUNDREDS IN THE FUTURE.

I had the Sweet Pig, not very flavorful, think Round Tables ham and pineapple is better. My husband had the deep fried prawns, they were a little over cooked but tolerable. Our friend had the fish and chips, he said pretty good. Before we were finished our server asked if she could cash us out because they wanted her off the floor. Hmm, another not so customer friendly move. All in all I would say this place serves the standard chain food that is a bit lacking.

My husband had the chicken fried steak and fried it was, pretty dry. My mom had the fish n chips and her fish was over cooked the batter was dark brown when it should have been the usual golden yellow. I of course went safe because I was hungry and ordered something they couldn't really get wrong which was the Caesar salad and it was good. Everyone else had basic stuff like a sandwich and burgers and they said it was ok nothing special. So overall I think this is a good ""lunch"" place but for good dinner food I think not.

Eden A.,"Salida, CA",0,11,,1.0,4/27/2011,Let me first say that they have a fun bar atmosphere. However in the handful of times I've been there I've had no good experiences. My first experience we were given a pager and a wait time of 20 minutes. We waited in the lobby and about 40 minutes later I asked the hostess when we would be sat. She told me that they had already called my number a long time ago and that we'd have to wait again this time for 30 minutes. Seriously? I ended up talking to a manager and he basically said there was nothing he could do for me and that it was my fault. So months later we went back again. This time there was no wait. However when walking through the dining room I slipped and fell. I ended up spraining my wrist. I was asked if I was ok  but no accident report was ever offered to me. Luckily im not one to sue. Then after we sat it took our server (who was obviously busy) almost 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. To top it off he brought me the wrong drink. I've since returned but now I only sit in the bar. The food isn't bad but the service and standards are less than average. The only reason I go is because my boyfriend likes their beers.

Both dishes were very bland and unsatisfying.  I make meatloaf and mashed potatoes 50x better then the crap that my fiance had, we've had better meatloaf at Red Tractor Cafe in Dublin for less then $10 LOL.  My burger was very tasteless, I was hoping it would have more flavor and spice considering it was supposed to have pepper jack cheese, green chiles, chipotle mayo,and ranch dressing on it.   I didn't taste mayo nor ranch, and I did check to make sure it had mayo on it.  The pepper jack cheese was even bland and the green chiles were the same kind of stuff I buy in a small can at the grocery store.  We've bbq'd up some better turkey burgers w/ pepper jack and green chile's then what I had at BJ's.   I really don't understand what the hype is, the food is below even mediocre, and the service is nothing to get excited about either.  I never once got a refill on my soda despite the constant refilling of my fiance's water, and at times the waitress seemed as though she could give a rats you know what if she was there or not.   On top of all that we waited almost 30 min to be seated, totally not worth the wait or the money.  I don't think we will be returning to BJ's unless it is a family dinner in which someone else requested to go there and we have no other choice but to join them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=500

The beer was $4.50 a glass.  I guess this is OK, but when you consider the price of the food, all of it is way too expensive. I had a baked potato with broccoli and chicken with Alfredo sauce.  Not bad but not something I would ever want again.  Not for 10 bucks! The appetizer was chicken pot stickers.  The photo on the menu looked good but when they arrived they were the same pot stickers that you can get at COSTCO for 10 bucks a bag full.  Here you just get 6 for 10 bucks. My friend ordered the angus burger and it was cold and flavorless. The waitress was nice but the hostess didn't seem to want to wait for a couple of old men (one of us is blind) to get to the table.  She ran way ahead of us. I would not ever go back to BJ's.  Mediocre food and high prices. One more thing.  Why are they building so many new restaurants and buildings in the parking lot of the Mall?  The lot is way too small for the Christmas rush already.

She tells me I cannot have the $4 off and a pizookie, even though neither coupon says that. I told her I will only take the $4 off. 10 more minutes go by and a guy brings a pizookie. I turn it away. then the waitress comes back and says they already made the pizookie, so I can either have it, and would I like to pay for it or have it for free.

We never made it, she says hey why don't we  hit the freeway go to the new BJ's instead of driving around in circles in the middle  of mo-town, at this point being a Friday and traffic i was game and hungry! It was impossible to find parking and getting through traffic to get to the Harvest Moon so they lost my business for that day.  What a excellent choice! An speaking of Choices it was so hard to know what to choose. They don't give you a menu they give you a book!!! There is so much to choose from we kept having to tell the waitress to keep coming back poor thing, our waitress was so patient and  excellent!.  When we finally did decided,we had the advocado egg rolls, and the chicken pot stickers to start, i had a root beer as well as a mixed drink which the root beer was excellent !!! They guy sitting across from me says pssssst  try there root beer its the best if you like root beer so i decided i would have both!  Food was excellent we both chose something that we both could spit she had the Meat Loaf sandwich, an i had the chardonnay shrimp pasta we were so stuffed!  Just roll us out to the car hahah kidding!!!   I just also thought they just had beer, i was miss staken, they also have a full bar, and sooo many different drinks to choose from.  I am not a big fan of beer so she had a beer and I had a mixed drink, it was delicious, I tried her beer and now i am hooked on there beers for not being a fan now I am! We were  going to have another drink, after all we ate we were so stuffed we could not drink another thing.  I normally do not eat that much, there was so much we both could not resist.

I cannot wait to go back again to any of the BJs to try more other things. next stop will be to the original place hmmm maybe  if I can get parking with out walking a mile if i cannot find parking then well you can figure where i will be.   Oh yeah almost forgot don't  leave unless you try one of there Pzookies!!  dessert was great the famous pzookie was mmmmmm wonderful!!!

Christine S.,"Salida, CA",0,8,6,5.0,11/28/2009,"Yum! We always go here when we have a chance to eat out. I always order the cheeseburger melt with yummy skinny fries, they are to die for. They are sometimes kinda slow but definitely worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=520
Joel G.,"Modesto, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/31/2009,"I've been to BJ's a couple of times and it's usually okay, nothing to WOW over, but the food is good, drinks are okay as well, but the service sucks booty. OMG, I went there the other day for a bday party and the service killed it. They took a good 30min just for drinks. It was a joke. Even though we brought the cake, they usually give you a bday cookie ice cream pastry and I felt so bad cause the bday girl wanted it and she never got it. I'd say I would come here for drinks and appetizers, but the hell with that, they take way too long. It's incredible that this place is so nice and they have crappy service. I think this place can be good, if they hired new staff and let go of these idiot high school & college kids. If you pay close attention, there standing in the back by the bathrooms texting. Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.  Sorry BJ's you only get 1 star, and I don't think you deserve even that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-modesto?start=520
