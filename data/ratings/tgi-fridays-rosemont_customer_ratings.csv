106,David N.,"Willowbrook, IL",167,532,1865.0,2.0,2012-01-06,"Maintaining the 2-star status after our last visit.  Our service was better this time around. Wait time for a server (and water) after being seated was cut in half, and the food made it to our table a bit quicker. Too bad the food itself fell short of its more respectable service time. Very inconsistent. One of our orders was wrong (out of five), and a majority of MY food was borderline cold. The only thing keeping my dish warm (obviously the white rice and steamed broccoli had been plated well in advance) was the grilled chicken atop the ""Dragonfire"" medley.  No joke, the temperatures on the plate varied from cold to warm, and when ordering something ""steamed"" and/or ""cooked"" you expect it served at a hot ""cooked"" temperature. RIGHT? To receive it colder than the dish itself is unappetizing and disappointing. Not to mention again the lack of anything resembling seasoning. I really think the cooks here are scared, or maybe advised by management to stay inside some bland, tasteless recipe box. That, or these cooks taste buds have disappeared. Whatever. I went in with low expectations, and came out again, with low expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont?start=100,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
131,Michele H.,"Harwood Heights, IL",0,20,2.0,2.0,2012-01-15,"I ate here about a year ago, the food sucked everything way too salty. I told myself never again. Well fast forward to present day, to my horror  I received a gc to this place for christmas! Unlike alot of other chain restaurants you can only use a TGIF gc at TGIF. So here we are on a cold sat night not having a real plan for dinner. I say to the hubby lets go to TGIF, neither one of us was overly thrilled with this idea, but he had no plan. We did get seated right away but thats where our luck ran out. The waiter was definitely not seasoned. Not rude just slow. Too much waiting for drink and app order. I am convinced it would not matter what we ordered, again with the overdose of salt. The chicken finger app was kind of hard and too salty. I ordered some sort of Jack Daniels glazed salmon. It was just ok. The food was lukewarm at best. My hubby ordered a cajun pasta dish, he liked his. Good for him. Then when we went to pay we gave the waiter the gc with our credit card so of course he didn't apply the gc to the total. We had to flag him down to fix it. If I didn't have that damn gc I would never have come back here. So the moral of the story is if you like very salty food and mediocre service come here, if not save your money eat somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont?start=120,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

We were at the TGI location downtown 6 months ago and it was awful. We got a gift certificate for TGI plus i'm a stripes member and got an email discount of 20% off our meal - so we decided to go. We got seated right away and our server was a kind young man. Kids ordered chicken nuggets and a cheeseburger and I had the dragonfire salmon. Kids enjoyed their meal. My salmon was a a very generous portion! i was so surprised! Foo foo places give you a 1/4 of the size. I was hesitant of the spiciness so server suggested putting the Kun Pao sauce on the size - what a genius! It had mandarin oranges, pico de gallo and this awesome slaw! Someone complained about the large broccoli stalk in a previous review, but i thought it was delish! Not too soft where it would fall apart when pierced with a fork. Hard enough to slice it into smaller pieces. I asked for a cup of melted butter and i was in heaven.

I notice most places are cutting back in quality because of the economy so really who is to blame. Our server was great she was quick and very friendly. all in all its ok I don't come here that often, i believe i was here maybe twice in 2012 and once this year because we got some gift cards for Christmas.

Fridays I have been to.  As soon as you walk in a manager & hostess greets you & the manager thanked us for stopping by.   We sat down & they had plenty of t.v.'s in the bar area. We started off with an order of potato skins & wings.  The wings & potato skins came out within ten minutes.  The wings were really good & even though the potato skins were a little dry they were still pretty tastey.   After the appetizers I had to use the washroom to make sure I didn't have sauce all over me like a slob.  Instead of just telling me where the washroom was the manager showed me.  That is how good service should be.   For our main course we had the Jack Daniels burger.  The burgers were awesome.  They were juicy & full of flavor.  One of the best burgers I have had in a while.   Overall the staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, the service was great & the food was really good.  I would eat here again if I was in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont?start=40,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.6079999999999997,2.68

132,Jane M.,"Harwood Heights, IL",0,39,,1.0,2013-11-16,"Short and sweet: Really poor service. We sat at a table in the bar area. When we first arrived, around 4:30pm on a Friday, no waitress was on duty yet so the bartender was our server. That might make sense when the place is empty, but as the night went on, not so much.  When the waitress did come on, she stopped to inform us the bartender would continue to be our 'server' - even though there was a shift change and it wasn't even the same guy. Needless to say, the bartender was not our 'server.' Stands to reason that he have his hands full working behind the bar, right?  The result was that we had to keep getting up from our table to go to the bar to order another beer, or get more napkins or whatever. It was all the more annoying when the waitress was right there taking orders from the tables on either side of us! So we would go up to the bar to order another round and instead of just giving us the beer, he would insist he would bring it our table. Umm...okay...even though I am standing right there. So now he would have to come out from behind the bar, to carry 2 beers to our table, leaving no one behind the bar. I'm sure during this time, there were customers sitting at the bar wondering 'Where is the bartender?'  It was just very strange. I also used the rest room before I left. One sink was clogged and had standing water in it, one towel dispenser was empty. The only good thing about this experience was that it gave us a whole new appreciation for the waitstaff at our other venues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont?start=120,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.148,2.6

Too bad I can't rate it with zero stars, because the Rosemont location on Higgins Road DEFINITELY deserves it! My family stopped here today around 4 pm to have a post-graduation early dinner (the ceremony was held at the Rosemont Theater). We had a party of nine that included a disabled grandmother, a special-needs child and a two-year-old.  We arrived and were told by the host (a male with no name tag - I looked) that no one would be available to serve our party for 30 minutes, because the servers had worked ALL day, and would't return until then. REALLY????  Sooo, my family will be inconvenienced because everyone was on break??  He suggested that we have dinner in the bar if we didn't want to wait. The table he suggested was a ten-seat with high-top chairs that were 3 ft off the ground! I looked around the host station and saw that SEVERAL tables were empty!  There had to be less than 40 cars in the lot and the place WAS NOT BUSY. I mentioned this fact and also that kids have no place being in the bar, but was told that this was our only option - WOW!!!!!   Since everyone was hungry as the graduation ceremony took 3+ hrs, my family proceeded to the bar and we had to LITERALLY pick grandma up to get her on that chair!! What would have happened if she'd fallen off?? I'm sure she would have broken a hip, but did they care? - NO!!  With all those tables available, why couldn't the server in the bar come to our TABLE that would have been possibly no more than 50 feet away from where they sat us? No excuse for this action!!  We had to box our two-year-old between his parents to make sure HE didn't fall off the seat!  REALLY, TGIF??  Our special needs child nearly toppled the chair and I had to catch her!! There is ABSOLUTELY NO excuse your company can give me to make me see this differently!!  Maybe if we had pushed grandma into your restaurant in her wheelchair (trust me, she has one but she tried to manage on her cane, so we left it in the car not knowing what we were about to encounter), there would there have been a different reaction?  Probably not, because the majority of your servers were ALL ON BREAK! The food was typical/marginal, our server did her job (and was tipped accordingly) but I can't get past the way we were ushered into your establishment and the indifference that was shown to my family members that needed special accommodations - or at least, NORMAL CHAIRS!!  I've owned three restaurants and have worked as a server in my lifetime, and what I do know is that a GOOD BUSINESS ACCOMMODATES IT'S CUSTOMERS, AND NOT PRIORITIZES/SATISFIES THEIR OWN NEEDS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR SAFETY!!

87,Theresa L.,"Chicago, IL",4,4,10.0,2.0,2015-08-06,"I have been to this TGI Friday's many times before and have always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere until last night. My boyfriend and I arrived at about 8. We were seated at a table in the bar section and our server (I don't remember his name, but he was the only Caucasian male waiter there) came over and asked us if we wanted to get anything started. I asked for a glass of water with lemon and he bluntly responds with ""No"" and looks over to my boyfriend to see what he wants. I understand it was a joke, but I found it rude and I asked him ""What?"" and I guess he understood I was serious and left the table to go get the water. When he came back to give me my drink, I placed an order for the AYCE spicy chicken tostadas. At $10, that's a steal and they taste AMAZING! The first plate came out fast, and when I finished, the waiter asked if I wanted another and I said yes, but after the second plate, I didn't get to ask for another plate until I had to flag him down 30 minutes later. After I finished the third plate, I was ready to leave it because it was getting late and I was getting fed up with watching this waiter pass us back and forth, but never stopping to ask if we wanted more water or another plate. My bf and I were sitting there for so long that he just decided to go up to the register to pay so we can leave, but the person at the register said you have to wait for your waiter to give you the check. There were literally 5 different groups of people that came after us and left before us by the time we had eaten and asked for the check because this waiter had us on the pay-no-mind list. When he finally strolled over to us with the check, even getting our change took another 10 minutes. At this point I had already left the restaurant and my bf was in there waiting for the change. He had to literally go up to him because he was so busy laughing it up with a different table to get his change. We have never in our lives left a restaurant without tipping, but that nights service by this man was extremely shoddy. 2 stars because the food was excellent and I would have eaten more, but I'm sure it would've taken an extra hour to flag him down AGAIN.

84,Pamela E.,"Chicago, IL",21,1,,1.0,2015-08-21,"I am livid. A good friend and I went to TGI Friday's in Rosemont on Thursday evening 08/20/2015, around 7:00pm. We wanted to try the endless apps. The server we had was dry and lacked a personality, for starters. I couldn't believe that because I have usually had very lively staff take care of me when I have dined there. Anyway, after we told the server that we wanted the endless apps with choices, she told us that we had to order our own, that there was not sharing. This struck us as odd because I though the whole purpose of appetizers was to ""share"" but okay, we get it, so we ordered our own and shared that way. Well, basically, we sampled plenty and we wanted to take home the rest that we had not eaten. I thought it was kind of odd that no to-go boxes were offered when we paid the bill. My friend asked for boxes and she snidely remarked that there are no ""take homes"". To our shock and amazement, she proceeds to grab the little centerpiece off the table to show us the tiniest print all the way at the bottom that says leftover apps cannot be taken home. First of all, my friend and I both have to wear reading glasses as it it, and if if you have been to Friday's, it is dim in there. I couldn't read the small fine print at the bottom of this card even with my reading glasses on! And who the hell would???? So, I asked to speak with the manager. This guy walks over and with a big-ass grin on his face he wants to know what the problem is, so we tell him that we would like to take our leftover appetizers home. He says, ""I do apologize, there are no take homes."" I said, ""So, this food is going to be thrown away?"" He says in the most kiss-my-ass way with a big grin on his face, ""Yes."" I reply with, ""You mean to tell me that this food is going to be thrown away and wasted and you say that with a smile?"" He replied again, ""I do apologize, there are no take homes."" Well, I do apologize for the bad review of your terrible server and yourself with your condescending, arrogant self that I am going to leave all over the web, corporate and on as many sites as I can possibly get my hands on. I do apologize that your server did not earn her tip when she could have allowed the take home and even if she couldn't, it was within your own power to allow this, Mr. Manager. You see, I use to be a restaurant server for many years and I know how difficult a job it is, so I tip very well. And I do not mean a measly little $5 bucks. See, I believe that your server should have made it clear, upon ordering the ""endless apps"" that there are no ""take homes"" and then we would have finished all apps that were delivered to us and not left any to be wasted and thrown away. It would seem to me that she was being passive-aggressive and thought, ""I'll show them"" and waited to drop that little tidbit as if she knew it was coming. That was ignorant and it was extremely wasteful!!! It was appalling and extremely disgraceful. The manager's attitude, to boot, really left one of the worst impressions of Friday's that I have ever experienced. WOW! So far, the word has been traveling far with family and friends. They agree, the ""no take homes"" should have been disclosed upon ordering. Nobody reads that small print crap! Just because it was located on the ad centerpiece does not make what happened right.

The sauce it all came with wasn't good either.  Traditional chicken wings with buffalo sauce.  Good and meaty. Sauce needed more flavor and spice.  Chicken and shrimp pasta - my brother loved it.

44,Eric E.,"Des Plaines, IL",10,235,11.0,4.0,2015-11-28,"A local standard for us - maybe 10 minute drive with good discounts / coupons / loyalty program. We've been here many times, with mixed fair to excellent service, and always fair to decent food. If we have a problem, they are consistently responsive, though have had to escalate it to the manager before. This really should be handled at the server level! The four star rating is based upon the Fridays model and expectations, multiple experiences but biased strongly on our last visit is the one which prompted this review. Many chain restaurants have corporate set menus, and Fridays fits this model. The menu items are diverse and tasty when prepared correctly. We were welcomed and seated immediately. Our server (don't remember his name) was friendly and prompt, always sure we liked what we had and that our drinks were never empty. He offered suggestions, and was very accommodating with our requests. This visit, my wife ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and I created my own burger. The chicken was ordered with different sides, and everything came as she wanted. My burger was ordered medium rare, and I was told the chef can't make it less than medium. I asked him to make it as rare as he felt comfortable, and it came back the rare side of medium, juicy and full of flavor. The onions and mushrooms were very good, with a topping of chipotle mayo, lettuce and tomato were satisfying. The manager, Walter, came by and said hello. He remembered us from a previous visit when we had some trouble, and both times he was very apologetic and professional in his response. We feel comfortable coming to Friday's in Rosemont because the food is predictable and good, and should there be an issue, we know it will be handled - at least at some level. We also suggest the restaurant seating area for better service, as we have gone barely noticed in the bar when we don't order alcohol. One suggestion, and another 1/2 star off, is that the men's restroom, though not toxic, seems to always need some attention. Water all over the sinks and waste basket at or near overflowing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.2239999999999998,2.08

The food and drinks were great, however, our bill came out to 47 dollars and some change. We asked the server Ashley to split the bill and she ended up splitting it incorrectly and giving my boyfriend 2 more dollars on his, but we just decided to sign and pay because we were ready to go. Once we got into the car, we realized that not only had she split the bill incorrectly but ended up charging us another 3 extra dollars from our original bill. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager and explained our situation and told him I wasn't going to go back for 3 dollars, but I wanted to bring it to his attention.

I ordered one of the burgers and the burger itself was good and the fries were delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont?start=20,2.6,2.44,2.44,,2.504
3,Rosa J.,"Chicago, IL",373,1007,3544.0,3.0,2017-02-19,"My boss chose ""TGI Fridays"" because she loves this chain.  Me?  It wouldn't be on top of my list.  Once again, ""never say never"" is my motto.  I was still ""somewhat"" looking forward to dining at their Rosemont location.   We were estimating between 6 to 8 people to show up for my store manager's ""pre-maternity leave"" dinner.  Whoever organized this event should have made the reservation for party this size.  Nevertheless, the hostess or the manager-on-duty accommodated our request within a short 10-minute wait.   Jessica, our server, provided good service, but she also took care a few other tables in proximity and at times we had to remind her for the items we needed, drink refills, round 2/3 endless appetizer orders (a number of associates opted for this option), and ultimately, the checks.   Splitting checks wasn't a problem.  Overall, I was quite impressed by Jessica's performance.  One of the ""secondary"" server was a bit rough on delivering the appetizers and the ""to-go"" cheesecake order.  We all knew her actions weren't ill-intentioned.   Well, the lackluster food I consumed this evening did some significantly damages on the rating of my review.  My ""steak & ribs"" entree wasn't, at all, memorable.  Although the steak was done how I wanted (medium in this case), it lacked flavor.  In addition, nothing was robust about these ribs.  They were also a bit sweet for my taste.   This might be the last time I walked into a TGI Fridays, unless my boss has another baby or has an explainable craving for some of her favorite finger foods (crispy fried green beans, buffalo wings, and fried pickles).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont,2.56,2.45,2.45,,2.494
8,Kathy P.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,160,57.0,2.0,2017-03-03,Sat in the bar. Slow service. Ordered a vodka tonic and my friends got tap beer which was $4. Linda ordered the Sam Adams nitro coffee stout which was good but not on special. Kim Crawford was 13 dollars per glass which is what a bottle costs.  My friends ordered the sliders and flatbread for appetizers. They liked them and would order again. Service was painfully slow. Waitress needs a smaller section.  Will come back only because it is close to work.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

We ordered the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken pasta, which was great,  and the Ribeye with mash potatoes and fries, this was also really good. The atmosphere was good as well; calm I mean. Our waitress on the other had gave us a little attitude. I'm guessing because we weren't ready to order when she came back from bringing us our drinks 10 minutes later from when she asked. My guess is she was probably new. Other than that it was a good time being there. I'm sure I'll be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rosemont,2.52,2.42,2.42,,2.46

My server was pretty good, my steak was good even cooked it to a perfect medium. But the ""crispy"" Brussels sprouts were anything but crispy. It was more like a soggy mini cabbage drowning in oil and vinegar. All in all had a good meal but did seems a bit pricey for a chain restaurant my bill came out to $63 with one drink each and an app. Not including the $13 tip. Should've just cooked a steak at home.
