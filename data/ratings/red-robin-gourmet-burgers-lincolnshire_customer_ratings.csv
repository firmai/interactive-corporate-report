It's more family oriented then I would prefer, but it is great for that if you are dining with kids.  This is a great place to go if you have a big group. It is a loud restaurant when busy, but it's not bad if you are the one making the noise! They have great burgers, and they have BOTTOMLESS fries with every order.

53,Elina S.,"Chicago, IL",665,705,220.0,4.0,2012-11-26,"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place since I've been coming here since high school. This was a high school favorite because the prices are decent, the burgers, fries and shakes were delish and they even gave us kids menus when we were really feeling excited. I would come here with my friends, my parents, my husband and have never had a bad experience here. Service is always top notch. More specifically, I came here yesterday and I got the crispy chicken sandwich which was so fresh full of veggies and the bun was super soft just the way I like it and the meat was oh so tender. I gobbled (thanksgiving weekend) down the entire thing. My husband had the regular cheeseburger and also really enjoyed it. Everything we've had from burgers, to wraps (my husband loves the bbq chicken wrap) soups, salads, mile high pie (oh soo good, especially during my stressful college nights) everything tastes great. Now the best part of Red Robin has to be the bottomless steak fries with their own honey mustard dressing. I could drink that dressing it is that good, and nowadays you can request the fries extra crispy and they even added sweet potato fries to their menu. That makes the whole experience that much sweeter. I can eat a whole basket by myself, but shh, you didn't hear that from me.  Overall, will continue coming here after the hangover nights, or just when I want something inexpensive for dinner that is consistently delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=40,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.216,3.8

When I was younger we used to get the fish and chips carry-out.  Now that I'm older I often go here for burgers and milkshakes. Good food, and kitchy decorations, often make good conversation starters. As I've gotten older I sometimes don't go here, just because it's a family establishment, and I don't want my friends or I to say something that might be inappropriate for young ears to hear.

20,Richard B.,"Skokie, IL",16,133,1.0,3.0,2013-08-17,"Why would two cold sober adults visit Red Robin for lunch?  Because we are cheapskates, and proud of it. Both my wife and I belong to the Red Robin Royalty Card Program.  It's an Internet based service that offers members free or discounted entrees.  Both my wife and I happen to be members, and each of us has a birth date in August - so voila!  The Royalty Card Program offered each of us a free hangerber (note the sophisticated spelling) for each of us. We had our adult daughter who lives out of town with us, and she willingly volunteered to pay for our sandwiches.  The apple does not fall far from the tree!  AND her first name is ""Robin.""  Really! We visited mid-day on a Saturday, and found this Red Robin to be relatively sedate and not very busy.  No screaming kids nor any screaming adults. We were seated immediately, and our server was very polite and professional.  The menu is somewhat limited to everyday fare that would appeal more to the young than connoisseurs.   I ordered a plain ""hangerber"" with mushrooms and my wife ordered some weird Jack Daniels burger concoction.  Robin (not the red one) ordered a sandwich wrap. The entrees were served promptly and correctly.  I found the hamburger to be fine - and a great value for what we spent.  My sophisticated gourmand wife snarfed down her sandwich and requested a free refill on her fries.  I, the man-about-town, swiped half of her fries when she was distracted.  There was nothing wrong with the way the food was prepared or presented. As I mentioned before, our waiter was very efficient and he kept us plied with soda pop until my bladder decided to cause me distress.  And I must add that they maintain their rest rooms very nicely. In summary, this is really a family restaurant focused more on kids than adults (although they do serve alcoholic beverages), and I cannot give it a top rating.  It is not a good choice for people who have high cholesterol levels or other health-related issues, and there is little creativeness in their offerings.  If I were rating this as a place for kids or teens, I'd give it another star in the Yelp rating system.   PS:  Robin paid for our meal, and I paid the tip.  Who got the better deal?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=60,3.96,3.96,3.96,2.9880000000000004,3.96

Go in knowing what it is and you wont be disappointed. Don't expect a Flemings burger here, because thats not what its meant to be. With this in mind, I usually get an A1 Peppercorn Burger, and I enjoy it every time.  Drinks: They have a full bar so keep that in mind if your looking for any specific drink.

I came here twice and while the endless fries and burgers are wonderful, the servers seem scatterbrained and ditzy. The first time, the waitress seemed to be in a bad mood and didn't really check on the table and seemed stingy with getting more fries. I couldn't get a water refill because she simply forgot about my table the entire time. It was nearing closing time so perhaps she wanted to leave asap, but it's still rude. The second time, I came again because I really enjoyed the food and I wanted to show my relatives. However, the waitress forgot to give our table silverware and napkins. Even after she brought our food, she still didn't bring us utensils. I had to grab another waitress who gave me a handful of napkins and one knife and one fork...for a party of six. Sharing is caring, I guess? (Fyi, the first time I came, I got utensils and plus all the other diners had utensils, so why did this happen?) Once again, she stopped by once to ask about the food and that was it. No water refills or anything until it was time to bring the check. My dad ended up pouring my mom's water into his cup so he could get something to drink. For fries, I had to ask another waitress to find her and get her to bring more. My table really enjoyed the fries, but they came out so slowly. In addition, our ketchup bottles were empty and I had to awkwardly take others from another table and remind the waitress to fill them up. Food-wise though - I can't get enough of the burgers! The numerous combinations are very fun to try and share. My prime chophouse burger was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and exactly as the menu described. This isn't misleading like McDonald's - the burgers are packed and huge! Although my second visit's burger wasn't as good. I had the mushroom and swiss burger. I told the waitress medium rare and she sounded confused about what that meant because it came out well-done (and with a burnt charcoal aftertaste) even though I requested it to be a little pink.  The seasoning for the fries is awesome! I wish I could buy a bottle to keep at home! I like taking advantage of the unlimited fries because I like sprinkling the seasoning on top. The fries come piping hot and have that perfect crunchy on the outside, soft inside texture. I had two children who got kids meals - if you get the Rad Robin burgers, ask if the kitchen if you can add cheese, lettuce, and tomato because otherwise, all you get is a plain burger. This is disappointing for the kids who watch their parents eat giant, fancy burgers. (Unless of course, the waitress forgot to mention we had the option for toppings, I assume you just get a plain burger.) Overall, I am hesitant to come here again since I'm a bit iffy about the service quality. Maybe take out is the way to go?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire?start=40,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.412,3.5200000000000005

While the place clearly had a drastic makeover, and looks lovely - the food quality has drastically declined. In addition, I was horrified at how expensive a dinner for me and my son was. High-to-Mid $30's when all was said and done - for horrible food.  Our waiter was lovely. Young guy, very nice. No issues on the service part.  I ordered what sounded tastefully tantalizing - Garlic Herb fries!! OMG doesn't it sound delightful?! Yeah, that's not what i got. What i got was dead french fries, with a HORRIBLE sprinkling of garlic powder. And they weren't even warm. They were like cardboard sprinkled with super cheap prison garlic powder. (Not that I know what prison garlic powder tastes like). They sounded so fancy and yummy on the menu - I was envisioning chunks of actual garlic, and green herbs, and other seasonings..... Nope.  I also had ordered a side of broccoli, and specifically requested that it be cooked extra-long so that it was soft. Once again - NOT what I got. I got *barely* cooked, almost raw, broccoli. With NOTHING on it. No butter, no salt - nothing. When I asked the waiter about it, he said they heat it in a microwave. And actually, upon clearing the table and noticing that i didn't take more than ONE bite of said nasty broccoli (which i promptly spit out), you'd think he would've offered to take it off the bill or something. But no.  The only thing that was somewhat decent was the burger. But they can't even cook it to order! I enjoy mine Medium Rare, and my son enjoys his still moo-ing (RARE), but they said they can only cook it Medium Well, so there's no pink left.  So we had two burgers, both with fries, a side of broccoli, and 2 drinks. Nearly $40.  Needless to say, I will NOT be back. Somewhere along the line, this restaurant lost it's way. Sad, because the new renovation makes the place *look* much nicer and up to date!  Laterz Red Robin. You won't be wasting any more of my money.

55,Ralph E.,"Deerfield, IL",0,8,,3.0,2016-01-12,"Good burgers, pretty good service, but unreasonable prices. That's how I'd sum up our recent ""night out"" at Red Robin, which as usual was very busy so we had to sit in the bar. That ended up being a good call, because the main dining room was stuffed with large families, parties and children and the noise was incredible. That noise was the reason we had avoided this restaurant for 15 years! But the bar is very hospitable for adults, has nice comfortable seating (high-tops); unfortunately the lighting is much too bright for it to be ""clubby"" or ""intimate,"" or it would be just right. The burger selection is inventive, but for $13 to 15 I expect a hefty beef patty, a very substantial bakery-quality bun and very generous toppings. Instead, you get what resembles a McD Quarter Pounder (although more flavorful and pink in the middle), sitting on a squishy bun. Barely better than a fast-food bun. If the heel (bottom half) of the bun is only a quarter-inch thick after the burger has sat for a few minutes, you are not eating a good quality bun. PERIOD. I think a $13-14 burger had better be the biggest, best damn burger you've eaten all month, or, it should be at really great restaurant where you are paying for premium atmosphere and service, not Red Robin. When I asked about some of the ""fun"" dipping sauces for fries, our server pointed out that some were added cost items. The list of added cost items on the sides menu is also long; extra for onion rings, extra for sweet potatoes, etc. This all just makes the owner look cheap. We paid about $40 for two people, two burgers, one beer and no extras of any kind except sweet potato fries for one of us.

Someone has to pay for all those changes, so now the prices have increased - it's now $10 for the standard Red Robin cheeseburger (with the paltry sleeve of fries).

New options are specialty fries: my son gets the sweet potato(big spender that kid with my $) and I get the garlic fries.

When you ask for a second order of fries it takes like 10 minutes for them to bring them out. It seems like they're getting stingy with bringing you seconds on the french fries and then by the time you get them you don't even want them. $80 is what we paid for 4 burgers and basic drinks! Oh we did get one kids meal and a short order of onion rings too but it was so expensive we don't want to go back for a long time.When we went it was a Wednesday night in the place was practically empty. The food was OK but it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. I choose the salad is my side and it was OK at least it was better than the broccoli which is like rubber and just awful. My granddaughter enjoyed her macaroni and cheese kids meal though.

They're essentially dark chocolate brownies and come with a raspberry dipping sauce. Sadly, while fries at RR are bottomless, Fruffles are not. They should be. Management--make it so! Also worth a mention is the chili con-queso appetizer and the variety of burgers (tho I can't wrap my tongue around the idea of  topping a burger with an egg, friends tell me the combination is quite good). The exception, and a waste of money in my opinion, are the couldn't-be-blander cheese fries.

They aren't the highest quality when it comes to burgers but they are good, quick and tasty. Lots of great appetizers and soups to pair with your dinner (personal recommendation would be the chicken tortilla soup). Cool feature they recently added was the ability to pay directly at the table at a little machine and then you're good to go. We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and the smoky jack tavern double. Chicken sandwich was good, prepared fresh and didn't taste like something deep fried. The smoky jack was good for any bbq lover with a little kick.  Here is the reason for the 2 lost stars: 1) The service was mediocre and I didn't feel like she checked up on us more than once when we originally got our food. Normally this isn't something I would pay attention to but RR offers bottomless fries and I didn't even have a chance to get a refill. 2) I honestly feel like their prices are a little high for a fast food franchise and for their level of quality. My burger was $7 but was literally child sized. The other burgers that were ""bigger"" are the ones that start at $13.

He said something and promptly came over, grabbed some menus, and asked if we wanted to have a cocktail. This location had remodeled since we were last here, and the regular restaurant seemed more inviting. Until he asked about the cocktails, we didn't understand a word he said since he spoke so quietly and mumbled. Our table was clean and well lit - maybe a bit harsh as the bulb was actually pointing at my face. Not too bad if I looked down, just a little on the bright side. Our server was good, but again lacking some of the enthusiasm he showed another table, where he may have known people. Service was otherwise solid, and he did all the right things in making sure we had what we needed. The food was very good! We tried an onion stack, which was tasty, if not particularly healthy. ;-) We ordered and split a California Chicken Sandwich, which was very good!

12,Alex R.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",38,7,4.0,1.0,2017-06-18,"I used to really enjoy going to this place. Since I have not been there for a while I was somewhat happy to go there for nieces birthday. However, my happiness turned into vapor really fast. To start off, 22 ounce beer was super flat. No problem, I was offered another by justifying that they do not sell too much of the first one.  Next, margarita drinks that other people ordered were hit or miss. Some had tequila some seemed to have mostly cheap mix. However, all were priced the same at $9.99, and thus required more to be purchased.  25 minutes later appetizers came out. Boneless wings tasted more like chickenless cardboard chunks covered in BBQ sauce to fool customers into thinking that they are real. Well, truth be told, Wendy's chickenless cardboard chunks do a much better job pretending to be boneless chicken wings. What idiot came up with boneless chicken wing concept. Are we this lazy? I digress.  Dip was just a dip, onion rings were almost like chickenless cardboard chunks but in a shape of a donut. Plates were wet, service was good as long as one of the guests constantly had to pass or receive plates of food or dirty dishes.  Best part... while ordering a gourmet burger I decided to go with. BLACK AND BLEU burger. I don't much like BLEU cheese but the picture looked soooooo good I decided to give it a go. Kind of excited to go out of my comfort box. Asked the waitress to make sure that my medium rare choice would not result in a bottom bun being totally soaked and wet, she ensured me that it won't be. In addition I was recommended to get French Onion soup as a side.  50 minutes later food comes out. My plate was handed to me so I can put it in front of me. As I took the plate I immediately noticed that my rectangle shaped plate had a burger on a left side and without any dividers had French Onion soup on the right side. Now if the soup plate was of a regular soup plate design things may have been ok, however, it was a plate designed for a cat or soy souce. It was less than a inch deep and my French Onion soup could not be contained. It was all over my plate. Naturally the bottom bun was soaked. In addition to that there was hardly any BLEU cheese on it. HARDLY!!! 3 crumbs. 3 freaking crumbs. What's the point of calling it BLACK and BLEU??? Call it a burger that looks nice on picture but like every other burger when served. Sad. Really sad. But I do have to ask, what C suite idiot decided to make soup plates less that inch deep. Does he enjoy looking a customer who struggle to fit a spoon into the plate, does he enjoy pretending that they are little kittens and need to use their tongues? Or does he think all the employees are robots who can control all their movements while bringing food to the tables? I think maybe he or she is trying to find a true America's Got Talent contestant because that is some crazy choice of plate and any person how has to serve it or a person who has to eat from it, knows it.  Hey Red Robin, it looks like your new menu and horrible food resembles your new management and decision makers.

I sure hope some action is taken. There was no excuse for this situation. Service tonight was completely unacceptable! My boyfriend and I came in to the Lincolnshire location around 8:30pm and sat in one of the booths along the west wall sort of behind the bar area (check your in house schedule for the male server that was there at this particular time in this location). It was reasonably busy but not overwhelming. We waited a very long time to even be acknowledged. My boyfriend was contemplating ordering a milkshake and our server barked at him and said that he would come back once he ""made up his mind"" about a milkshake. He decided to pass because the server was being so rude. We ordered a crispy chicken salad, a bacon cheeseburger, and an order of the Chili Chili Cheese Fries. After our order was finally taken, our server returned with 2 small appetizer plates. Both plates were FILTHY!!! One had some orange sauce (buffalo??) on it and the other had some white stuff (ranch??) on it. I flagged our server down and asked for some clean plates because these were so dirty. When he returned, the one plate still had orange sauce on it. What did you do, just blow on them and bring them back to us??? I pushed the plates off to the side because I couldn't trust that they were clean. Chili cheese fries without a plate is not a pleasant experience.

I wasn't expecting much since my last memory here was of overworked and over cooked burgers. This was a pleasant surprise. While the only options for the burger were pink or no pink, the person answering the phone let me know they would do the best to make it as close to medium rare as possible. I ended up with a juicy, pink in the middle patty. I went with the A-1 burger. It included bacon, pepper-jack, A1, lettuce, tomatoes and onion straws. The onion straws were pretty sparse although they would've been great as an appetizer. A little issue with the menu description, the crispy onion straws were relatively soggy. The applewood smoked bacon just tasted like regular bacon. I guess since you eat with your eyes first, this was the way you could picture what you're eating by reading an in depth description first.

The food was fine so if you're looking for a bite to eat before catching a movie and have more time than required at Chipotle but less time than Big Bowl this is a good spot.  Oh, the bottomless fries is the best thing going for this chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire,2.48,3.02,3.02,,2.8040000000000003

Bartender was pulled in every direction but was attentive to all needs of her tables and continued to follow up if I was pleased with food and needed anything additional. Food was equally great as the service and brought out in a timely manner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lincolnshire,2.52,3.04,3.04,,2.8320000000000003
