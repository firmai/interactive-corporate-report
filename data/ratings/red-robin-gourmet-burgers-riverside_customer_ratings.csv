152,Drew D.,"Riverside, CA",21,32,74.0,4.0,2012-07-30,"We went to the new Red Robin at the Galleria at Tyler for their opening night, It is in the spot formerly occupied by TGI Fridays, before they moved into their new digs.  Its great to finally have Red Robin in Riverside.  Great service, and great food! I had the Burnin' Love burger, which was delicious, but not as good as the 5-Alarm Burger it replaced. It was perfectly cooked, and very tasty. My friend had a glass with a chip in it, but the server whisked it away and replaced it, and the manager came right over to say how sorry he was. It was busy, being their opening night, but the service was spot-on, and our drinks never went empty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=140,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472,3.472
151,Janet T.,"Riverside, CA",3,28,,3.0,2012-08-04,"If you know me, then you know I am a fan of the Red Robin franchise. The two that I frequent the most is the Redlands location and also, the Rancho Cucamonga location. Before this location opened the closest Red Robin to me was the Redlands location, so you can say I was a bit excited when I saw the big RR banner outside the Galleria at Tyler.  The boyfriend and I visited this location during noon yesterday and it was pretty busy. There were an abundance of greeters at the door; however, they weren't really helpful at getting us seated. The hostess that directed us to our seats seemed confused as to where to sit us. She finally sat us in the corner booth of the bar that was of the utmost difficulty to get into since it was right next to someone's chair. From then on, it wasn't too bad.  Our waitress was kinda awkward, but she was nice. However, we saw another waiter who spent more than a good few minutes chatting up a customer and avoiding his other tables. The food tasted the same compared to other RR's. The restaurant itself was sort of small. All in all, I'd rather drive to the Redlands location and enjoy the atmosphere and company there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=140,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.276000000000001

How many diners do that, seriously? Waitress was so nice and came back to check up on my friend and I. She was definitely happy, cheerful, and helpful. Drink: Ordered the special (alcoholic). It was super strong, but I didn't really drink too much of it, so I didn't really mind. Non-alcoholic: Strawberry lemonade is delicious! Recommend Food: Bottomless fries are so yummy, especially with the special seasoning. My friend and my food came out pretty quickly.  Ordered- Guacamole Bacon burger: So good and not too messy. Guacamole was okay (had better), but the meat was very juicy. Simple Burger: Simple, but still very good. Towering onion rings: OMG so yummy and it's so pretty!

Also tried the campfire sauce, recommended by our server, which was a mixture of ranch and bbq, i think. Whatever it was, it goes great with there steak fries. Lastly can't forget about their drinks. Had a variety of shakes, smoothies, and lemonades. I tried the mint brownie shake, which was heaven.

I gotta say, I have never experienced such a good customer service for all the times I've visited a RR. Also, their food comes out A LOT faster! Our waiter was the best, he waited no time to bring us extra order of fries so we wouldn't have to wait. He refilled our drinks & helped us with all our concerns extremely fast! As for food, I think all RR restaurants tastes the same so it all really comes down to customer service and the quality and quantity of the food.

We didn't get refills of our empty teas either. Of course he magically reappeared to drop off the bill. Came back on Tuesday for a late lunch with my mom. They're in the midst of renovations, so all the artwork is gone and they've got boards on the ground in the lobby area. They've switched to Ziosks, which is fine if you're like Chilis and are fully staffed. However, as multiple people have pointed out, this RR is too understaffed and now they've added Ziosks to avoid actually having waiters around.  Besides the 15-minute wait just for the server to come to our table and get our drink order, the food was awful and not well thought out. We each got a salad. I had the Avo-Cobb-O and the waitress said they were out of boiled egg. Um, why not make more? They take 20 minutes. Hell, the Target literally across the street sells them already boiled. From the time you opened until 3PM when I came in, could no one find the time to boil a few eggs? I saw a whole lot of standing around and laughing that suggests otherwise. The salads used to be served in a bowl, tossed already. Now, they come on a very long, narrow plate and the ingredients aren't even completely chopped let alone tossed for you. I had whole leaves of Iceberg in my salad. The chicken was in giant chunks that weren't completely sliced through. Trying to chop it up and mix the dressing with my salad resulted in a big mess. The stale, cold garlic bread on the side was the highlight of the meal.  This location needs to stop being cheap and get more servers out on the floor. On our most recent visit, the host had to run food and drinks because our server had 8 tables to deal with. Meanwhile, two managers (one male, one female) were at the pass, just chatting and having a great time. These Ziosks are not the answer. What good is a button to reorder drinks if I can see that the one and only server you have on staff is currently clearing off a table and then rushing back to the kitchen to pick up someone's order?  Stay away. Mediocre, old food and a long wait to get it. Edit: talked to the manager at the Corona location. She said the understaffing is a corporate thing. They're being given roughly a quarter of their usual hours and are being told to make it work. Yikes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=40,3.28,3.58,3.58,2.244,3.4600000000000004

The bacon on this burger had the texture of beef jerky and looked like it was heated with a hair dryer and then somebody spilled red paint on it. The bun was about 2 minutes away from breaching the stale barrier.  It's dryness was cough inducing. The patty, or more accurately the carbon based black mass of sadness smushed between the stale buns of depression came in second place to gypsum board as the restaurant's most flavorless substance. I ordered the microwaved steak fries with my burger and my wife order the exact same fries but with the heading ""garlic fries"" where said garlic was carelessly sprinkled onto the surface of a single fry.

Ummm noo I want some pink but it's fine I don't want to waist food we can take them. So I'm not sure who she was but I'm assuming she was the manager only because she had a different color shirt.

56,Jason H.,"Riverside, CA",143,57,7.0,1.0,2016-08-28,"So my wife and I used to frequent this particular Red Robin weekly. The manager and staff were amazing, we formed a close bond with Tammy the main manager because she always took great care in making sure my wife's unique order was handled safely, she has celiac and chrones so everything has to be handled very carefully.. Since Tammy has left management other than tremaine who we also love has gone down hill.. Tonight we were greeted by a guy in a cowboys jersey who was more concerned with the game then actually greeting us. Our waitress was great, Jasmine did an awesome job handling our party of 8'(celebrating moms bday).  Things really went down hill tho when I was about halfway thru my avo-Cabo salad when I found an incredibly long and nasty hair.. Jasmine was mortified and took it right back to have another one made.  The second try came out and this time instead of a piece of hair I noticed an all black (actually multiple black) pieces of avocado. At this point I just gave up and stopped eating all together.  The manager I think named Stephanie Didn't seems concerned with the fact that i hardly touched the second try.  Instead she came by and casually dropped off a ""free appetizer"" or dessert coupon and said, ""for the trouble"" ummmm, the least you could do was take this one item off the bill that was already close to $150!!!

8,Sarina L.,"Riverside, CA",469,177,234.0,3.0,2016-12-10,"Red Robin is a great place for gourmet burgers. Their menu never ceases to amaze me as there is always new burgers to try out. When I order a burger, I either like to have an egg in it, some avocado, or some barbecue sauce with some bacon in it. I've had:  -Royal Red Robin ( it has an egg in it and bacon... bomb..) - Whiskey River BBQ (Fried onions and bbq sauce) The latest time that I went I got the buzzed mac and cheese tavern. Burgers and mac and cheese? Sounds like a great combo. It was only 6.99 with bottomless fries. I thought it was okay. It is smaller than their gourmet burgers. The mac and cheese had an interesting taste, it was a little sour to me. But overall, it tasted pretty good. But I'm not sure if I'd order it again. I got bottomless sweet potato fries ( additional $1.29 but totally worth it)  I give this location 3 stars because of service. They have these new table kiosks to pay and potentially order as well. I feel like because of this, the waitress was a little less attendant to our table. It took a long time to get additional baskets of fries. This has happened before so this time once we got our burgers, we asked for another order of fries. And based on their slow time, it came out halfway as we finished our burgers and the rest of the fries. Additional baskets took a little longer. It was also hard to flag down the waitress.  The little machines gave us a little headache. It started malfunctioning after the second card swiped. It took a good 15 minutes for the waitress to help us and print us our receipts. I'd say a good third of our visit was just waiting, either for food to come or for assistance.

Definitely the kitchen staff short coming. The manager was really sorry gave me a another wrap to go home and and a discount off our bill. Now that's how you handle a customer issue.

It is completely unacceptable for staff to be talking about their customers but especially about their sexual orientation, I'm not sure what this has to do with them or their job but I found it highly offensive, and I immediately wanted to leave, had my friends not already have ordered I personally would have left. I am very disappointed in the way this restaurants employees behave. This is about the third time I've been to this specific restaurant and had issues with the servers.

Burgers for us are usually Bakers, the Habit, in & out, Islands, Carls, etc... We went here a few years ago & were not too impressed.   So when we got this coupon, I decide to give them another chance & treat ourselves to gourmet burgers. I got the burning love for about $12.  Any burger for that much should be a five or six Stars, Unforgettable, Melting in My Mouth, Extremely Uniquely Tasty & Delicious!  Again, the same disappointment as last time.  Mine was dry, no sauce, cannot taste the pepper jack cheese,  No Unique special taste!  it was not spicy or tasty really. It tasted like my husnands bbq, Ordinary. The meat was rubbery.  Not soft & delictable ( like the habits ). The original amt of fries you get are like 12.  Just because their bottomless doesnt mean you should be stingy on the first round. They were gone so fast & it took a long time to get the next round of 12. Haha!  So to leave spending 80-100 on these burgers is thievery.  My kids were like, "" I like The Habit"" better.    Thus, I will never waste my hard earned money on this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=40,3.28,3.13,3.13,,3.19
76,Gerardo R.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,2.0,2017-08-15,"I went today for the first time and I must say I was extremely disappointed. I went there on a date thinking it would be a great place to get some good food and a friendly atmosphere. The food was good and that's the only reason I give it two stars. I would give zero stars for their customer service. It was almost towards the end of our dinner and our server had placed a pitcher of water on the bar and when he closed the door leading into the bar the pitcher fell and water got everywhere including on me. It wasn't a few drops but if not I got my glasses wet, my arm, and my shirt. I was really embarrassed because customers were laughing and instead of the server that spilled it coming up to me and apologizing for what he did he stayed at the bar and yelled ""I'm sorry"" but was not sincere. He saw me drying myself off and didn't bother to even offer me a towel or even more napkins. I found it completely rude and unacceptable that he never once came up to me to apologize for what he did. He just blew it off as if it was no big deal. I understand hat accidents happen but working in the service industry you make sure you go up to someone and apologize and try to make things right especially if you spilled water on them because they were being careless. After all that we were waiting for our check and it never came. I had to pay with my card because I just wanted to get out of there asap. I was astonished by how poor service I received and this is my first and last time I ever come to this location. It's saddens me to know that this place has good food but employs people that don't care. I am not expecting to get anything out of it but a sincere apology was the least that could have been done. I wouldn't recommend anyone come here and I know this restaurant has lost my business as well others that ask me about this place. I hope management fixes this issue and makes sure that this never happens again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=60,3.16,3.1,3.1,,3.1240000000000006

I probably would have given this place more stars if it wasn't for the rude hostess at the beginning of our visit. Rachel was super sweet and quoted us 20 minutes to which we agreed to and took a seat in the waiting area. We started to notice smaller groups that came after us being called before us, which we understood because they were busy and we were a group of 5. When we noticed that another person from the same name had been called we simply asked if it was our group to which a new hostess Hannah, replied rudely ""We're still waiting on a booth for you guys (we hadn't specified which we preferred) you were quoted 30 minutes and it has only been 12"". All she had to say was that they were still waiting for a larger table for us. There was also a manager standing right next to her who said nothing about the rudeness. We would have gotten up and left if it hadn't been for Rachel calling us once again to seat us. Our server was great and the food was good but when I approached a manager with my complaint he didn't seem all too concerned. I work customer service as well so I understand rude customers,  but we weren't. We were simply asking a question. I understand that everyone has bad days but you are being paid to give your customers a good experience. We paid a lot for our food so I just feel like we should have been treated better. Had the manager cared a little more I wouldn't feel the need to write this review but here I am.

I brought it to his attention and just said ew gross! he then brought me a new one, which I couldn't drink cuz I was feeling pretty disgusted.

They told us it would be a 30 minute wait & it turned into an hr & 15 minute wait. The only reason why we stayed was because the kids wanted to & it was one of their birthdays. The hostess' were disgustingly rude, I could hear them talking about our party, one rolled her eyes. While we waited a random family arrived & they asked the hostess question, as soon as the family walked away the girl started cursing at the other hostess and talked bad about the family. As we still waited my aunt asked the hostess a question about the wait and one of them got sassy with my aunt and called the manager which was no help either. I had my 2 month old sleeping in his stroller and they claimed that he was the reason why the wait was taking so long! We were only a party of 5, how hard is it to figure out where you guys want to sit us. After waiting over an hour we finally got seated, our server Jacob was outgoing, sweet & friendly unlike the other 2 rude girls. The manager then comes out & brings us complementary chips & salsa. My food was delicious & our server was great. If it weren't for the 2 dummies up in the front I would have given them a better rating.
