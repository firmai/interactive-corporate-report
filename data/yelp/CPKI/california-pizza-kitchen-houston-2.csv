David K.,"Irvine, CA",5,37,,5.0,3/21/2016,"Super impressed. I'm a big service guy and the service was amazing. Friendly staff and great waiters. Russell, my waiter was awesome and I came in by myself. He still treated me like I was a party of 10. Russell deserves a raise! Love him.  Food was good. CPK usually is. Just really felt like they appreciated me coming there. Thanks CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Mike B.,"Dallas, TX",2,21,,1.0,10/17/2016,"We went here after we first moved near the galleria area. I had been going to CPK at least once every other week since college when I lived in LA so I was just looking for a little bit of home. The only thing that went right this night was that we were seated right when we came in. The hostess told us our server would be right with us, got us both waters and went back to the hostess stand to sit down and look at her cell phone. We sat and waited, waited, and waited. 15 minutes and 6 servers walking by us later and we still had not been acknowledged. This was not a busy night as it was a Wednesday around 8. So being hungry and not greeted we got up, left and grabbed some dinner just a block away. Now here is the kicker, a we drove by after eating we still saw our two glasses of water sitting at the table we would have been eating at. CPK I don't blame you BUT I blame this location and the employees you have working there. Can't call it a customer service fail if we never got served. Hope you can change some of the bad apples.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Awesomeness B.,"Houston, TX",32,5,,5.0,11/22/2016,Love this place! Pizza is delicious. Pastas are to die for. And don't skip the dessert! Especially the butter cake with ice cream.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Danny L.,"Houston, TX",191,524,3991,4.0,12/27/2013,"I took my family here yesterday and had a really good time. Our waiter was very friendly and funny which brighten the mood during our meal. As far as the food, not too bad. I honestly still prefer papa johns pizza (even though its not gourmet), but where else do you find fancy pizza like ""pear and cheese..."" or a pizza with like five different types of mushrooms in it.  The only downside is the price. One pizza is usually about $13 and it comes with six thin slices. I think I can finish an entire pizza myself, or 1.5 kids can eat an entire pizza. If you take an entire group of kids, be prepared to spend some money!  I signed up for their rewards program and got a small free plate. Sure feels good to save a few bucks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40

Eldar A.,"Houston, TX",0,16,8,1.0,10/30/2015,"Service is horrible! Cold Pizza!  Ignorant staff! Don't trust me? Stop by and experience for yourself! I've been here on two different occasions: first time during a weekend and during empty week afternoon - they did acknowledged sloppy  service the first time siting that the place is busy and i bought that, however when I experienced the sam when the place was empty i understood that this is chronic management problem. Last time my waiter Edmund was just sitting and chatting with his friends while my whole order was ready waiting for him to pick up. When I complained they said that they are waiting for my son's Mac and Cheese... Result, i got cold Pizzas!

Jase M.,"Austin, TX",1,23,1,2.0,12/19/2015,This place has gone down hill so much the past few years.  The first sign was when they stopped serving real focaccia bread on their sandwiches.  Now half of the staff have bad attitudes and the fish tacos taste like fish sticks.  The pizzas and the tortilla soup are the only things saving this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40

Sudy S.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2015,"I've been so APPALLED, UPSET and FURIOUS  that it has taken me this long to be able to write this review! I don't care if their food is any good (haven't been there in a long time and will NEVER EVER go back again), they REALLY need to either get out this business or get a HEART and become much MUCH more compassionate!!! My sister, my friend and I were stranded in our car in front of the restaurant with ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE TO GO at the night of the one of the BIGGEST FLOOD STORMS in decades, on MEMORIAL DAY night (yes, the same SRORM that killed SEVERAL people that night) for 5 LONG hours with water raising rapidly to our car doors and HORRIFIC THUNDER AND LIGHTNING above our heads, and NOT ONLY they wouldn't give us shelter, they wouldn't even let us in to use their restrooms!!!! They said it was for liability reasons because we hadn't dined there that night!!!!! WHAT???? REALLY??!!  Maybe they could learn some HUMANITY from their kind neighbors POST OAK GRILL and BERRYHILL who had apparently left their doors open all night long, with wide open arms, to EVERYONE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Misty R.,"Charlottesville, VA",15,10,35,2.0,3/26/2016,"I'm going to start this review by saying that I loved the food and service. However, I remember when just a few years ago CPK's main focus was on pizza. If you look at the menu the majority of the focus is on alternative dishes (meaning not pizza), and a small little leaflet is dedicated to pizza. Why would I go to California Pizza Kitchen and order steak, seafood, or pasta when I can get a high quality gourmet pizza? Not only is just a small section devoted to the pizza, but they have taken away a couple of my favorites. They don't even have friggin kalamata olives anymore! The pizza that they do have is better than Pizza Hut or dominos, but for the price we paid for our pizza I expect something a little more high end and ""different"". Meaning make me a pizza that I can't get anywhere else. California Pizza Kitchen you should go back to your roots, remember it was pizza that made you great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40

Eric C.,"Houston, TX",0,13,7,3.0,1/1/2016,"Food is normally pretty good. But we tried the curbside pickup after ordering and paying online, and arrived when we were told to.

Les R.,"College Station, TX",5,125,318,5.0,9/22/2015,"I love me some CPK! I first found this one back in 2000... have since sought out the ones in Austin and DFW areas. I have NEVER had a bad pie here, LOVE, LOVE it! I'm a huge fan of the NYC style pizza, especially when in the City, love North Brooklyn places or South Queens, but as far as pies out of the city, the ole CPK is the bomb! NOT a fan of Chicago style, so you are safe here. My wife tried the pasta (which I have not, just love the pizzas) and I had to taste... pure awesome unique flavor, Pasta was fresh, cooked to order and the sauce was what seemed like a perfect mixture of marinara and Alfredo sauce. I stick to the CPK favorites most of the time, such as the BBQ Chicken or the one with bacon, but also like the other specailty pizzas. My son loves the ole tradional pepperoni. Can't wait until back in town... or Austin, or DFW to stop back in a CPK! BUT this one is and has always been great... 15 years and running! Well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Mariah D.,"Houston, TX",408,483,261,4.0,8/5/2012,"What I love about CPK is the infinite options for pizzas/pastas/salads/insert-delicious-food-item-here. The staff is always so great about doing a half and half pizza and 86ing one ingredient while adding another. The thin, crispy pizza crust is great while still standing up to heaping ingredients. I hate tomatoes, but I love pizza, and this is truly THE pizza place for anti-tomato persons, like myself.  It's a little on the pricey side, but the ingredients are fresh and the combinations are original so I don't mind the price tag.  The flavored lemonades WITH FREE REFILLS are another draw of CPK. I'll start with a Kiwi Lemonade, then enjoy a Mango Lemonade, and finish my meal with a Strawberry Lemonade. Yeah, they let you do that. All for one low price.  They also offer great coupons regularly. So regularly, in fact, that I will not go in without a coupon. Check their website and Facebook page for deals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Chad M.,"Houston, TX",581,517,214,4.0,1/11/2015,"We ate here with our son last night and I was struck with how well-run this location is. The General Manager visited our table twice and I noticed that he interacted with every aspect of the staff - that is a great sign in these days where service in restaurants is typically the first thing to suffer. The food was typical, but the service was spectacular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Karina P.,"Spring, TX",263,155,114,5.0,5/26/2012,"I love California Pizza Kitchen, not only because of their innovative and elaborately creative menu items, but also their fresh ingredients. They're very accommodating to those with food allergies, and I always enjoy a good meal when I come here. The servers are very attentive and pay special care to their customers. Their menu denotes which items are gluten-free with a GF symbol and unlike most restaurants, the options are actually great and not just limited to boring salads. Even the salads here are a work of art though, so don't shy away from them!  The roasted vegetable salad with Dijon balsamic vinaigrette and the original BBQ chicken chopped salads are superb, and two my top favorites. The white corn guacamole + chips small plate features the best guacamole I've ever had... and as a Latina, that's saying a lot. It is complex with a unique sweetness from the corn. Absolutely fantastic. Overall, this is a great place to come for lunch or dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Maria S.,"Houston, TX",128,320,913,4.0,2/5/2015,"I hadn't been here in years and attended this week for a birthday dinner.  I remember I wasn't crazy about the food here.  I'm still not that fond but the waiter and the service is what encouraged me to give this place four stars.  My receipt says ""Whelvin"" was my server.  We were a party of between 15 and 20 and Whelvin gave each of us separate checks.  You still don't see that in some places.  He also proceeded to not add to our checks an 18 or 20 percent tip.  That's another plus for Whelvin.  I didn't like my pasta that much and asked him if he might give me marinara sauce on the side.  I wasn't charged for it.  I've been to places where you will be charged for extra marinara sauce.  One of the guests in our party brought two cakes. We were each given a small plate and a fork for this.  Some places will charge you for a cake fee. I was amazed with CPK's server.  My dining neighbors (friends) seemed to love their margaritas too.  I also got to try this Thai appetizer with chicken and peanut sauce.  It was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=40
Stefanie H.,"Spring, TX",0,15,1,2.0,6/22/2014,Food was fine.  The ceiling leaked from A/C condensation and when we pointed it out we were told it was no big deal.  I was told to download the CPK App for a free small plate -- but it turns out you have to sign up online and so I received the wrong small plate first and them was charged for it despite being told it was free.  Next it took more than 25 minutes for the manager to fix my check and when I checked my bank account I was overcharged by $5.  I had to call and send the manager a picture of my receipt to get it fixed.

Angela S.,"Anchorage, AK",88,44,11,3.0,8/25/2013,"After a long day spent ""stimulating the economy"" at the Galleria, I stopped by CPK on Post Oak for a quick nosh & rest for my poor tired toe-sies. Post-dinner rush, the dining room was full but there wasn't a wait - we were immediately seated in a cozy booth by the windows.  Our server immediately stopped by with waters and we decided to partake in the white sangria as reward for a successful shopping excursion  Our sangria arrived moments later - a nice fruity blend, not too sweet and filled with large slices of pineapple.   Next came the seasonal white corn & black bean guacamole served with yellow and blue corn tortilla chips: delicious! The sweet white corn was a welcome addition to the usual guacamole. We followed our tasty starter with the spicy chipotle chicken pizza on honey wheat crust: in all it was a very spanish-themed night.  The pizza sauce was perfectly spicy and tangy, with a slightly BBQ-esque consistency, and the corn & black bean salsa atop the perfectly baked crust was fabulous. I have one hands-down requirement for pizza: the crust absolutely MUST be cooked all the way. Thankfully, no dough-y crust to be found here.  And don't let me forget - the dipping sauce was a frothy, cilantro ranch perfect for the tangy crust. Service was top-notch as well, never overbearing but always present and helpful at exactly the right time. To top off a delightful meal, our server stopped by with a gift: Turns out, the bartender made too many white sangrias, so there we were - one more sangria to share! Fantastic end to a lovely meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=60

I've been here w/ a group of friends and this place let us all down. Worst of all you pay more for what you get.  These places look nyce, staff is friendly as they should be, but they're quite inflated b/c the food isn't tasty. This kitchen ain't too hot, & i'm getting out of it anyway.

Devra G.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,1.0,12/28/2013,"Miserable experience!  Terrible service.  Negligent when you need them, or want to ask questions, bothersome once you are finally eating.  Tried to ask a question about a soup and our waiter shrugged off our question and ran off while we were still talking.  We didn't see him for at least another 15 min, and had been otherwise ready to order. We were shoved in the very back corner of the restaurant, despite the very numerous open tables elsewhere.  Apparently this was the undesirable section, as we were seated only near large families with screaming kids.  We were the only two in the back section not dining with children.  I'm assuming this is because we have unnaturally colored hair (though otherwise dressed nicely), and this is a rather upscale neighborhood.   There's a bit more, but we're still here waiting for our check, so we can get the hell out of here.  Never coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=60
Raven G.,"Houston, TX",538,171,175,3.0,7/12/2014,"I went here for the first time yesterday, and it was pretty good. Parking around lunchtime was actual hell, but that's to be expected. I liked that even though it was crowded, we weren't terribly close to the ther parties, and somehow, the noise level wasn't outrageous either. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. I had the bacon and avocado egg rolls to start; in so many words, I am still dreaming about these little morsels. Perfect blend of smooth and chewy textures, and the flavor was phenomenal. My roasted artichoke and spinach pizza was nothing to brag about, but it wasn't bad!

Anthony B.,"Houston, TX",59,148,,3.0,2/2/2013,"I, Mason, the culinary dachshund announce that I am very disappointed in Anthony in his several visits to California Pizza Kitchen.  What does the name say? PIZZA. What does Anthony order? SALAD. Does it say California Salad Kitchen? NOOO! Ok, I like the occasional cold juicy lettuce heart piece, but why go to CPK and graze on arugula and garbanzo beans when you can get BACON on a pizza!! Or BBQ Chicken. Or Salmon. Or  Pepperoni. But NOOO, Anthony gets a salad *rolls eyes*. Ok, on to the review. I actually had some snacks of salad leftover Anthony brought home. They do make nice salads, some of the nicest around, with fresh ingredients, nice toppings, and will accommodate any adjustments to the offering.  Anthony does follow my instructions on bacon - when available, order it, whether a salad, a burger, cheesecake or used to stir a bloody Mary. But I digress. Nice dressings. Crisp.  He actually had a pizza a couple times. Chicken Chipotle adobo sauce, fire-roasted poblanos and Monterrey Jack with corn, beans and salsa. Now, Doxies are German and we prefer some nice knock wurst, but damn that chicken was tasty. Not only did I get a .5 nanoseconds' worth of a slice but I got to lick the plate. The BBQ chicken was delicious, thin crust so my lithe, lean figure isn't compromised.  With all this goodness, he went back and got SALAD again.  I'm not allowed in the CPK due to those archaic laws not allowing dogs in restaurants. OK, so I lick the occasional ankle but Anthony had me tutored at the vets and I don't hump ankles.  But I digress again. Anthony says the people are nice, the place is clean, service is attentive although it's a crap shoot who shows up to take your order, deliver food and the bill.  They are willing to box up leftovers for me, it isn't called a doggie bag for a damn cat, right?  Well, folks, I have to close out this review as dinner time is approaching. Should I look malnourished, or exceptionally cute?  Ahh, the difficult decisions a doxie faces in life.

The pizza is not as crispy and the food, in all, just does not taste as good/fresh as the one at the other location in Houston. Also, the service at this location is not good. I've had bad waiters/waitresses that forgot to bring my entire order. There is also a wait at this location compared to the other. I always go to the other location because of all these issues and because they are only 5 minutes away from each other.

A C.,"Houston, TX",14,14,,1.0,1/7/2016,"My husband and I have frequented this location for years, mainly for the curbside takeout service. We will NEVER again. EVER. Today I had my 13-month-old fast asleep in the car and needed to grab lunch without dragging him into a restaurant. I called to place an order and was hung up on. I called back a second time and successfully placed my order. 13 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and called to notify them. 13 minutes after THAT I called back to inquire about the delay. After all, I had placed an order 26 minutes before for a SALAD with no hot items. I was told it was coming right out. 3 minutes later I called back and out popped a server with a check but no food. It took over 30 minutes before the salad arrived in my lap from the time I placed my order. The server was friendly, but I asked to speak to the manager. He was NOT so friendly. In fact, he served up attitude right from the start. Trying to approach the situation in a laid-back manner, I said ""Dude, we have a problem."" Before I can get in another word, he said, ""First of all, DO NOT call me dude. My name is ----."" I was seriously appalled. This is a MANAGER! Here I am trying to be light-hearted and relay to him the situation and he confronts me with nothing but attitude and sheer rudeness. Now I'm beyond pissed. He said that he wished I would have called sooner so we could address the problem. Um, I called your restaurant a total of 5 times before I could get a salad. I called 3 times to get a human face-to-face. My patience had been completely exhausted. We carry out an exchange that isn't worth my time detailing and I leave calling corporate to file a complaint. The fact that this is the sort of management CPK now employs is a downright joke and it's no surprise the restaurant is run so piss-poorly. This location is a waste of space in a prime retail spot. With management like this, it won't be there for much longer and perhaps a better option will move in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=60

K S.,"Houston, TX",1,50,2,2.0,11/13/2013,"This was the first time at this particular restaurant and the second time at a California Pizza Kitchen anywhere.  The pizza was good but the service was awful!  An abundance of wait staff should not equate to an abundance of wait.  After being seated, a waiter passed by us 5 times and never once acknowledged us.  We sat for almost 10 minutes before a different waiter finally asked if we'd been helped.  After finally getting our drinks, we noticed that everyone around us was getting a small plate of bread but that we did not.  We figured it must come with something they ordered but we didn't ask. Overall, the restaurant on this particular night was filled with staff who were paying more attention to each other than to their customers.  The manager seemed to be joining in the fun and was not managing at all.  We won't be returning to any CPK after this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=60

BC S.,"Houston, TX",14,42,126,1.0,12/17/2015,"OK this is sad... I've been going to this since the 90s. They have always had a great staff (most I knew by name and they knew my usual order), great food, a great facility, and it was just a treat to go.  No longer. Tonight seemed to be a sign of lack of good leadership (or any at all).   We walked in along with another couple and there was no hostess to seat us. Several waiters (some just chatting at the registers) and what I think may have been either the bar tender or manager (only think because he had a landyard around his neck) just looked our way and didn't move.  When the hostess (Ch...) finally arrived she had no idea who got there first and made no apologies. She was rude and put off when we chose to sit at our table not at the chair she had pulled out for us.  The waitress (who was really nice by the way) accidentally spilled a glass of water on the floor. It sat on the floor until it totally soaked into the carpet AND ALL THE ICE MELTED. When we left no one had yet addressed it. The waiters all walked over it, the bus staff walked over it, and who probably was the manager walked over it (it was in the main walkway of the dinning room).  If that wasn't enough we watch the person we think is the manager handle food with only one glove on but using BOTH hands.  People were having to raise their hands at their table to get their waitstaff's attention. And then it wasn't even their waiter or maybe it was because it was never the same person twice helping them.  The restrooms also are in a state of disrepair. You would think at least the hardware to lock a door would work (even the fix to the broken one was broken).   Usually my reviews give people the benefit of the doubt but this just wasn't right.  We will go back to the one on West Gray. We have been regulars there (we changed because it was closer). The manager is a person that used to be here on Post Oak and he has kept the standards that was used to here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=20
Leslie M.,"San Antonio, TX",236,156,106,3.0,10/20/2015,"I used to work for California Pizza Kitchen years ago as a hostess. It is one of the few places I've worked where I will continue to eat at. It is clean, employees are friendly, and the quality of food is good.  I came here for a late dinner last night around 9pm with a friend. The place was decked out in Halloween decor which was fun. We were sat immediately but at a tiny window table which was a little silly considering almost the entire restaurant was empty.  Our server took about 5 minutes just to greet us and take our drink orders. I asked for a gluten-free menu and was handed a 3x5 flash card size menu with FOUR kinds of pizzas to choose from---sad. I ended up ordering the pepperoni and my friend ordered the barbecue chicken both on gluten-free crust.  It took about 10 minutes for us to get our food. The gluten-free pizza crust was somewhat chewy and lacked flavor, but the toppings made the pizza worthwhile. The cheese was hot and had great flavor. I really liked how my pizza had two kinds of pepperoni. My friend's toppings were great too, but her crust was also chewy. Overall, the experience here was a positive one, but there was a lot that could have made it better. More selection for the gluten-free menu, a better gluten-free crust, and also more attentiveness from our server would have added another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=20

I haven't been to California Pizza Kitchen or heard of anyone going to California Pizza Kitchen in probably 10 years. However, my dad had a gift card for this place so we decided to give it a shot again. Surprisingly, it's pretty good!!  Here's what we got and a short review of each item: -spicy chicken quesadillas small plate: when they say small, they aren't joking. It was like 4 pieces total. However, they were delicious! They came with a really yummy dipping sauce too. I saw online that if you sign up for some point card you get a small plate free, so this ended up being free for us. Otherwise I probably wouldn't want to pay $7 for 4 small pieces.  -tortilla soup bowl: so yummy and great portion! Would probably get this again.  -chipotle chicken pizza: fantastic! Everyone in my family loved this. It came with a sauce that you drizzle on top which was really tasty too (we ended up asking for more). Would definitely recommend this.  -jerk chicken pizza: ew. That's really the most appropriate way to describe this dish. It was way too sweet for my taste and I couldn't eat more than a few bites. No one in my family liked it.

Being new to the Houston area and having never tried CPK, I was really excited to try it out! Our place back home closed up before it was even there long enough to attract anyone.  We have currently only been twice, but the servers are great. Happy people and super personable. The reason I gave it a 4 star review is honestly because of the overall cleanliness of the place. At a recent visit when I unwrapped my silverware, I wasn't sure if they were water marks or they were just dirty. But either way, if it doesn't look clean and I have to wonder if it is, that makes me a little nervous. Also the bathroom. I hate using the bathroom in public places anyway because of the fact that I have Lupus; I am more prone to getting sick from germs because of my low immune system. The toilets weren't very clean, neither were the floors, and overall I just felt like I needed to shower after I used the bathroom. It didn't help that it was oddly dark for a restroom and the door opens almost right in front of a stall.  I know how hard it must be to keep public bathrooms clean throughout the day, but I think what needs to be considered is, ""Hmmm, would I want to use this bathroom? Would I think this is gross if I was a customer walking in?"" Still awesome food and amazing service! I would definitely go if I was craving it.

Despite this, I love the place.  When I'm in the mood for a designer pizza, CPK delivers a very good rendition:  A perfect cracker crust (slightly sweet) with a medley of toppings that harmonizes better than one would expect. And CPK pulls it off better than other places that have more cred (Star Pizza comes to mind, and whatever happened to Wolfgang Puck's spot on Westheimer?)

My most recent visit was one of those mediocre times.  My waiter seemed almost scared or overwhelmed with his job, and was too distracted to do a good job serving us.  The drinks were so watered down that I will never order alcohol here again.  Paying nearly $8 for a glass of ice with a little bit of flavoring and very minuscule amount of alcohol was disappointing.  I could more easily get drunk off of eating a rum cake than I could drinking an alcoholic beverage from here. There are better restaurants in the area, and I'd rather go to several other pizza places over here.  While it's true that their unique flavors of pizza are interesting, I could do without the other issues.  I'll probably go back to this place again some time, but it will have to be with someone else who is really set on going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=100

The whole wheat crust is possibly one of my favorite pizza crusts in the whole wide world, but then I found out it contained honey (I'm vegan, so I try to NOT eat that stuff), so I started ordering my pizza with the pansy unbleached flour crush.  Still good, but not as good, sigh.   The Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup is actually not that fantastic, but I used to order it from time to time because it is vegan and sometimes I'm just not feeling very pizza-y. I'm sure a great deal of the salads can be veganized, but I've never bothered.   As for my omnivore friends - most of them have had fairly good experiences here.  It's reliable food, but it doesn't completely bowl them over, so we don't really come here all that much anymore.   Granted, yes, this is more expensive than Domino's or Pizza Hut, but the higher quality is discernible in the hand-crafted, sometimes very creative pizzas.   I haven't been here in years, but I do remember the service being mostly good.  Even when I sometimes dined with larger groups, we did all receive our orders in due time.   I can't say I would go out of my way to go to CPK, but I wouldn't mind eating here again if a companion wanted to.  One of the better chain restaurants I've ever been to, that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=100
David S.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",130,149,16,3.0,3/1/2009,"What can I say, CPK is CPK.  As national chains go, they serve a relatively health menu with fresh vegetables and salads incorporated into many of the dishes.  I hesitate to say ""pizza"" because it is stretching the definition considerably to serve it with lettuce, uncooked tomatoes and avocado on top. On the other hand, it made for an interesting dish.  I find the pasta dishes heavy on the pasta and the soups salty and over starched.   If you are watching your carbs, you are going to have to watch carefully here. Light and airy atmosphere.  Sitting at a CPK in Houston on a sunny day in March, it almost feels like San Diego.  I am not a big fan of team waitressing.  Maybe we just hit them at shift change, but one person took our order, a second delivered the food and a third brought the bill.  They were all cheery in that corporate sort of way, they got the job done and my ice tea was refilled as needed so I guess I should not complain, but who am I tipping?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2?start=100

My biggest problem was that the overall impression I got from all the CPK staff - from the manager on down - was that this seemed kind of like business as usual w/them - no big deal.  This CPK needs to learn about service.  No one here has a clue they are in the service business, and also their food is overpriced IMHO.

Was disappointed to see they got rid of so many of the menu items I had loved from them in the past. The Japanese eggplant, the said goat cheese and pepper, pear, and many other pizzas are off the menu. Actually, even with their name containing pizza in the title there didn't seem to have as many pizzas to choose from as they once did.  However, they did have a smaller apps menu, which had two salads on it which would make a good personal starter. I opted for the asparagus one, and it was tasty. The other was a wedge salad. The pea soup my beau order was good enough for me to probably order it next time myself.  The mushroom pizza while good wont be my favorite either. I will have to try another next time or ask if I can make a pizza from the ingredients they have listed.

Iris T.,"Houston, TX",132,233,291,4.0,1/12/2018,"Family from out of the country were here and it was their last weekend with us. Due to our dietary restrictions (vegetarian, nothing in the allium family), we've been limited to our kitchen and a few Asian eateries so I was very interesting in expanding. Oh, one in our party is a strict vegan on top of the no allium rule. We chose this place.  I had gone to a few locations before, but it was years ago. I didn't remember much other than pizza. Because of that, we started from square one.  It was around 6:40 pm on a Friday. Most of the party arrived and the ones who got there first requested for a table to be set up - 8 adults, 2 babies. We were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waitress - never caught her name, but I was on the tail end of the flu so my hearing was still off - came by almost immediately to take our drinks when we were still getting settled but we were ready the second time. Water, no ice.  The rest of our party joined us around this time. We needed her back because we couldn't just freely order anything with a green leaf (for vegetarian friendly) and expect to get it. We needed pointers. Unfortunately, that was when more customers came rolling in and her section got full. It took a while but questions were asked and answered with her going back and forth and we eventually got: Bread and Olive Oil - this is complimentary and delicious. The waitress assured us the herbed oil was onion/garlic free but when it reached our table, there was a strong smell. Even with my partially blocked passages, I detected something off. Sadly requested for just the oil  and more bread and she came back with everything saying she double checked and there isn't any allium but she did as asked. Most of the party have abstained from items in the allium family for decades. It sometimes doesn't need much other than to be stored close to smell like it. It makes other things off putting. The oil used is a good extra virgin. On a challenge at the end, my sister and I shot down the remaining oil and there was that peppery burn of oleocanthal. Crispy Mac N Cheese - this is a small plate and we got two. It's purely Mac and cheese that's breaded and deep fried. There are 4 pieces to an order and are delicious. Then again we got one each so maybe that's why? Vegan California Veggie - this was for the vegan in our group. Ordered without the normal marinara and subbed in the neopolitan sauce (crushed/diced tomatoes) and took out the onions and cheese. It had a bit of everything! Other than cheese.  California Veggie - same as above but with cheese. Colorful, the flavors worked well despite the amount of ingredients on it. If I had to pick a well-balanced pizza, this would be the winner.  Wild Mushroom - took out the original base and subbed in olive oil. I love fungi and this was good and simple.  Three Cheeses & Tomato - I actually don't recall anything that needed to change with this. I call this the amped up margherita. A classic but with multidimensional cheese. A winner! Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake - got one to share. It sounded too good! I wouldn't call it a souffle but it is lighter than your typical cake and less intense or sweet but it was beautiful. The nibs were key. General notes: - Food was excellent across the board. Mixed feelings about that herbed oil but thought the pure olive oil was perfect. The dough is chewy. I adore chewy pizza dough with a crisp edge and patchy lightly burnt bits. - Service was good. She was as helpful as could be but it got somewhat slow as soon as all her tables were full. We were there for almost two hours.  - California Pizza Kitchen May be confused on what consists of vegetarian cuisine. The crispy Mac and cheese lacked a green leaf on the menu. Upon further questioning, it contains egg. Vegetarians can eat egg, but no meat products (seafood and insects included) or products directly derived from meat like gelatin. It's vegans who abstain from eggs and dairy along with anything from animals, whether directly or not. Honey, for instance, is not vegan.  - Setting was clean. We didn't have our own plates from the beginning but that was rectified right before we got our entrees.  - For 8 adults and a snacking 23 month old (the other infant had her bottle), we ordered 2 of the small bites, 5 pizzas, and 1 dessert. We also had two rounds of bread and oil to start off with. We finished every last bit. It amounted to around $14 per adult, including tip. I'd say it was money well spent!  The best part: the visiting family enjoyed it!  Thanks for letting us leave with our bellies full and smiles applied!

Served with housemade ranchito sauce and herb ranch.)  The pink sauce which is their housemade ranchito sauce is addictive.  I always ask for extra because I dip everything in it.  In fact, my waiter even suggested trying this sauce on my pizza and it was awesome.  The pizza is a thin crust with generous crispy edge and the whole thing is packed with flavor.  I don't always eat the crust when it comes to pizza, but here I do.  This is one my favorite pizza places.  More reviews on that later.  Hmmm, maybe I need to create a list for all of my favorite pizza places.

Bianca N.,"Houston, TX",6,122,87,4.0,7/7/2017,"We stopped by the Galleria location around 3pm. The place had only 4 tables filled, before we left a few more came. We beat the evening rush. I had the thin crust , I had the Sicilian my sister had a tostada with beef. The pizza was good, I of course had leftovers, after 2 slices. We did have room for warmed butter cake (like rich pound cake), the cake was heavy and rich, I took a few bites then gave up - we split the cake, it was too much for me. We skipped drinks and just had  water. All in all , a happy visit. The service was fast and friendly, the server answered all my questions changed a few items on my pizza and was very pleasant during our service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2

Nour I.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,4.0,9/23/2017,Came with my fiancé food was great but our waiter didn't provide good service. Plus they left us almost 15 mins without anyone coming to take our order.  The waiter seemed like he was high or he didn't care to serve us.  Disappointed even thou I always come to the restaurant never had any issues But I would still rate the food as a 4 stars..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
Wendy T.,"Stafford, TX",269,293,844,3.0,7/24/2016,"hmm...the last time I tried California Pizza Kitchen was years, years back. It was decent back then, but seems the food isn't as good and is just pricey without the taste. I got the basil pesto chicken which I felt wasn't very flavorful, and it was also served in a smaller portion then I expected for its price tag. I tried the Bianco flatbread which was decent, but was not amazing. Disappointing....will be a while before I go back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
Corey M.,"Houston, TX",199,325,83,1.0,5/6/2016,"Wow when your food is worse than the frozen food section at the grocery store; California we have a problem.  When you regularly screw up to go orders for catering, yeah you have a problem.  When your staff can't even speak English properly yeah you've got a problem. In a nutshell this places uses cheap ingredients, cooked by low paid immigrants with limited knowledge of the English language, they regularly screw up catering orders/to go orders, and it's just gotten worse over the years..  To be blunt this place is NOT upscale, it's just in a nice area, food isn't good, nor is their idea of quality control. Seriously you're better off with a frozen pizza or making one yourself, even their salads have gone to crap. This location should just close, they're simply that bad and clearly mismanaged.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
lizzy h.,"Houston, TX",146,91,167,1.0,1/12/2017,There was a dog suffocating in a car next to me. The staff and ignored the pleas from the guests and did nothing's about it. The pup was panting and was suffering. The windows were covered with with smog. When I reported it the staff told they told me to leave or they would call the police. The other patrons were complaining and were ignored. The staff; especially the management were cruel and heartless. No wonder the turn over is so high. Boycott this place.  Do not do business with a place so deplorable.  If you do business here you are condoning animal cruelty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
Liza K.,"Stafford, TX",120,175,202,3.0,7/11/2016,"Sadly, when I think of where I want to go California Pizza Kitchen is never a first choice. I can't figure out if its the taste of the food or what. I feel this is one of those reviews I may have to update. Some good things: haven't had to experience long wait before getting seated, waitresses are usually polite, and the ambience is always happy and upbeat.  Cons: The wait time for the food can be long, and the food isn't memorable in my experience. I haven't found a dish that makes me think, ""Oh, let's go to California Pizza Kitchen!"" On the plus side, I've never had the thought, ""This is disgusting."" If you have a dish you love, then this would be a great place to return to time and time again. I just haven't found it and until then this place is just okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
Alexandrea T.,"Pasadena, TX",227,17,37,4.0,6/13/2017,"I had already been to another chain of this restaurant before and went again after North Italia (across the street) was way too crowded. The Sicilian thin crust pizza was really good. The sourdough bread and olive oil served before the meal was not that great and not very warm. Our waiter (forget his name) was phenomenal and very attentive which made the experience better. Overall, I'd come back but only if I want something quick that isn't fast food or willing to settle for a decent chain restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
Linda T.,"Houston, TX",101,346,393,5.0,4/21/2016,Have not been to a CPK in a million years I really mean million...lol!  Heard CPK mentioned twice in 1 month so I figure it's time to visit one again.  Have not looked at the menu forever and missed the Peking duck pizza...seriously old school but my other favorite Kung pao spaghetti was definitely still there after all these years. Yay!!!  I had raspberry lemonade the spaghetti a mini wedge which I can appreciate that I didn't have to do the whole thing. My husband really wanted me to try there avocado rolls but they were sold out. The manager and server was able to come up with a few pieces and tell us it was on the house. How sweet!!!  Top it all off we had the butter cake and I didn't even give it chance to be photographed!  Diante was our server and she was really amazing. Excited to come back again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
Dorothy H.,"Mission, TX",0,9,,5.0,6/2/2017,An excellent dining experience. We were in Houston for appointments at M.D.Anderson and weren't familiar with the area. We actually stumbled on this restaurant while looking for another. A very pleasant surprise. The atmosphere and service were wonderful. We decided on the Shrimp Scampi with Zucchini ribbons and were very pleased. We will visit it again given the opportunity.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2

Sylvia O.,"Cypress, TX",27,8,,2.0,5/26/2017,"This place has gradually gone down.  If it wasn't for their BBQ chopped salad,  I'd likely never go there again. The portions have gotten smaller and the staff, um, more ""interesting"". It used to be really busy during the lunch hour and unless they're getting more take out orders than before and instead of eat-in customers, the place has lost a lot of business in the last 5 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2
