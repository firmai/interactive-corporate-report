We stopped in for lunch with only an hour to spare and I was a little worried we would make it back in time. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The staff was very friendly and our server made her present known but didn't hover. I ordered the Beets & Goat Cheese and Edamame. Both dishes were good. My friend got the Turkey Burger, which she enjoyed. For a chain restaurant, this was a good experience.

256,Miliardo P.,"Philadelphia, United States",13,108,3.0,3.0,2015-01-09,"Ok, this is weird! I had pretty good food and fantastic service at the bar. The food wasn't quite as good as King of Prussia but they're new so I was willing to write that off because they're still new.  So I got five star service and four star food,  so why a three star review?  I've been going out to dinner for over three decades and have never experienced anything like this.  I also have a pretty good sense of humor and am generally hard to offend.  All that being said,  onto the story.  While eating at the bar a server came up and asked me,  who won the superbowl three years ago.  I told her I didn't know but I could Google it, she then began to berate me for not knowing and walked away. I just shrugged and went back to eating.  Three minutes later,  she asked and I quote ""Where would you most likely wake up with a finger in your ass"". I had absolutely nothing,  wasn't even sure how to reply to that. Then I was treated to stories about how she came to work high everyday and what drugs she uses etc... AND SHE KEPT COMING BACK!!!!! I don't know if she was high then or if she thought she was funny,  but I hurried up to finish my food and get out because it was just uncomfortable.  Worse part, they don't wear name tags so I can't tell you who she was. If the powers that be are reading this: she was the VERY obnoxious server working 8/25/15 @ 9pm. And if by any chance you're reading this maam, you're not funny but disrespectful to a patron who was just trying to enjoy a dinner",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=100,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002

417,Sharia W.,"Philadelphia, United States",26,50,272.0,1.0,2015-02-11,"I was very disappointed with this particular restaurant because it's one my favorite restaurant chains. The manager (a female) was not attentive to us when 4 out 8 people at our table was served and 2 happened to be children. She heard our compliant and never returned to let us know what was going on or to even apologized or ask us how our food turned out. By the time the food came out, the other 4 people were almost finished and the kids had to eat bread because they were so hungry. I was never treated so poorly at any other cheesecake factory before in my life. When getting the check, the manager did take off the 2 kids entrees. but I had to let our waiter know that my dad and I didn't get our burgers until everyone else was done eating. How long does it take to cook a burger??????? Like really. One positive thing, was the view. Hell, I'll take good service over view any day. Valet was pretty pricey @ $22.00 a car. I would rather stick to Cherry hill, KOP, or Willow grove's cheesecake factory. I will NEVER visit this cheesecake factory location again.

259,Sing L.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,11,,2.0,2015-04-10,"I have been to only 2 locations for The Cheesecake Factory. This one and the one in KoP. I was amazed by how good the food was when I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience at KoP, so I was thrilled to find out they were opening one up in center city.  I went a couple days after they opened and I was fairly upset with the quality. The pasta was just not as good and the hibachi steak was not as flavorful. The mashed potatoes had huge chunks in it, which kind of ruined that. I figured, they just opened up so maybe they will get better with time. Went there a second time hoping for a better experience but my hopes were shot down. The service was a little worse, which was already a bad start. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta this time and it was not as great as I was hoping. The pasta was decent but the chicken was incredibly bland. My girlfriend got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo which is a let down. The shrimp was burnt and the steak was too salty. The mashed potatoes once again had huge chunks. Is it that hard to make proper mashed potatoes? We left that night with a Kahlua cheesecake to go because we had to get out of there. I don't know whether it's the thought of that Cheesecake Factory being a disappointment compared to the one at KoP that made the cheesecake a little worse or the fact that it was actually worse. Nevertheless, if you want Cheesecake Factory, take the drive and go to the one at KoP.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=100,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003
254,Cam M.,"Southern Pines, United States",4,14,1.0,1.0,2015-04-10,"WORST BRUNCH EVER! If only zero stars were an option. My wife and I decided to give CCF a try for brunch today. As we came in the door there was no one greeting at the bottom of the escalator. So we ventured up to the restaurant and we were seated right away on the patio. The server was just straight preoccupied. As it took so long that we gave our drink order and food order at the same time. When he returned with our drinks my wife's tea cup was filthy. When the server returned he immediately said ""oh I forgot to tell you, we're out of French toast.""  The restaurant serves so much bread how are they out of toast. Maybe they are out of eggs? We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes as a replacement.   While waiting for our food we noticed our server serving bread to other tables. So we asked can we have some bread.  ""Oh ya I forgot"".  Our food came out before he returned with the bread. My dish was supposed to come with toasted bread. ""Oh sorry they burned it I will bring some out."" My crab Benedict was fine one of the eggs was over cooked. My wife's pancakes that we're supposed to be lemon ricotta were just plain pancakes.  When I complained to the server. He said the lemon ricotta was inside.   Well folks I cut a bite out of the center of each pancake and the lemon ricotta was lie, none found. I complained again. ""I'll let my manager know"".  When he returned he told me his manager took our drinks off the bill.  I know this trick, he didn't talk to anyone he just hadn't added our drinks to the bill yet. Fine, I'm not looking for a free meal. I just want it to be done and served correctly. So we asked for some syrup for our plain pancakes. We were told they don't have any except for the melted butter they served with the pancakes....  Thus my wife's pancakes were now non edible.   Our server then told us that the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do brunch well at all and that we should have come for lunch or dinner instead. Way to talk about your own restaurant! Why even offering a brunch menu if you aren't going to offer it correctly? Safe to say this will be my first and last visit to the tourist factory there are way to many good restaurants in Philly to waste your time in a non-customer oriented atmosphere. I HATE writing bad reviews!

213,Mike F.,"Reading, United States",86,146,351.0,3.0,2015-05-11,"Whenever I think of the Cheesecake Factory, Vince Young always comes to mind. As his dumpster fire of an NFL career was coming to an end circa 2012, reports began to surface that the former Eagles QB and third overall pick of the 2006 NFL draft was known to spend upwards of $5,000 per week at the Cheesecake Factory. I know NFL players enjoy the lavish lifestyle, but come on, $5,000 per week at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY? You're a millionaire. Treat yourself. That's like if I went out tonight and spent $200 at Taco Bell (I've come close).  Sources now say Vince Young is now working at an undisclosed Cheesecake Factory location as a short order line cook. Get 'em, Vince! This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. Not sure how I was able to avoid them for this long. You know, there's a lot to like about this place. The dining room is pretty darn impressive. Lots of head room.  Pressed for time, my buddies and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table. Service was friendly, though not the most attentive. As a fairly outgoing group, we were able to get the attention of the bartenders. But I noticed a lot of quiet couples around us being completely neglected. This was actually making ME feel a little awkward, so I made it a point to tell the bartender not to focus solely on my group and to help the other people standing around. Not sure why this was necessary ... you'd think they would do this on their own. Food portions are HUGE! Has anyone else ever ordered the chicken fingers here? You seriously get like two pounds of chicken and another half pound of mashed potatoes. Seriously. It's obscene. In a good way, of course. Would I come back? Sure. I love riding escalators to the main dining room. I don't get to do that much here in Reading.

It has a great spot with views of the city which makes it a step above the average Cheesecake Factory at the mall. Overall the food is great. The menu can be overwhelming for some since it literally is a 20 page book, but it is filled with a great variety. There is literally something for everyone. There were plenty of vegetarians options, and portions are huge! Don't forget to save room for cheesecake though. Having tried at least 10 different cheesecakes they have, I have never been disappointed. Strangely they seated our party of 5 on a table for 4 and then seated a party of 2 in a large booth for 5/6 people. Maybe they are still working out things since they are still relatively new, but this was really inconvenient. Also, service can be slow since the waiters have lots of tables and literally have to run around to keep up.  Overall, the food was great, and there is so much more to try so I will be going back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=60,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.8640000000000003,3.3600000000000003

We ate a table near the bar and had very friendly waitstaff who were quite accommodating but a little bit slow, the restaurant/bar area wasn't very crowded.  We each had a beverage and a skinny-liscious appetizer.  It took awhile for the food to arrive, I had a trio of lettuce wrapped tacos which were messy but very good. One friend enjoyed his flatbread pizza which sounded and looked delish, my other friend enjoyed her app but part of it wasn't great, I tried it and wasn't impressed.  All in all it was a fun evening, the music and ambiance was nice. $49 for 3 apps, 1 drink, 1 soft drink seems a little steep to me.  We were all hoping for a light, skinny- licious desserts which they don't offer.

I've been going out to dinner for over three decades and have never experienced anything like this.  I also have a pretty good sense of humor and am generally hard to offend.  All that being said,  onto the story.  While eating at the bar a server came up and asked me,  who won the superbowl three years ago.  I told her I didn't know but I could Google it, she then began to berate me for not knowing and walked away. I just shrugged and went back to eating.  Three minutes later,  she asked and I quote ""Where would you most likely wake up with a finger in your ass"". I had absolutely nothing,  wasn't even sure how to reply to that. Then I was treated to stories about how she came to work high everyday and what drugs she uses etc... AND SHE KEPT COMING BACK!!!!! I don't know if she was high then or if she thought she was funny,  but I hurried up to finish my food and get out because it was just uncomfortable.  Worse part, they don't wear name tags so I can't tell you who she was.

The menu can be overwhelming for some since it literally is a 20 page book, but it is filled with a great variety. There is literally something for everyone. There were plenty of vegetarians options, and portions are huge! Don't forget to save room for cheesecake though. Having tried at least 10 different cheesecakes they have, I have never been disappointed. Strangely they seated our party of 5 on a table for 4 and then seated a party of 2 in a large booth for 5/6 people. Maybe they are still working out things since they are still relatively new, but this was really inconvenient.

As we came in the door there was no one greeting at the bottom of the escalator. So we ventured up to the restaurant and we were seated right away on the patio. The server was just straight preoccupied. As it took so long that we gave our drink order and food order at the same time. When he returned with our drinks my wife's tea cup was filthy. When the server returned he immediately said ""oh I forgot to tell you, we're out of French toast.""  The restaurant serves so much bread how are they out of toast. Maybe they are out of eggs? We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes as a replacement.   While waiting for our food we noticed our server serving bread to other tables. So we asked can we have some bread.  ""Oh ya I forgot"".  Our food came out before he returned with the bread. My dish was supposed to come with toasted bread. ""Oh sorry they burned it I will bring some out."" My crab Benedict was fine one of the eggs was over cooked. My wife's pancakes that we're supposed to be lemon ricotta were just plain pancakes.  When I complained to the server. He said the lemon ricotta was inside.   Well folks I cut a bite out of the center of each pancake and the lemon ricotta was lie, none found. I complained again. ""I'll let my manager know"".  When he returned he told me his manager took our drinks off the bill.  I know this trick, he didn't talk to anyone he just hadn't added our drinks to the bill yet. Fine, I'm not looking for a free meal. I just want it to be done and served correctly. So we asked for some syrup for our plain pancakes. We were told they don't have any except for the melted butter they served with the pancakes....  Thus my wife's pancakes were now non edible.   Our server then told us that the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do brunch well at all and that we should have come for lunch or dinner instead. Way to talk about your own restaurant! Why even offering a brunch menu if you aren't going to offer it correctly? Safe to say this will be my first and last visit to the tourist factory there are way to many good restaurants in Philly to waste your time in a non-customer oriented atmosphere.

110,Sing L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,,2.0,2015-10-04,"I have been to only 2 locations for The Cheesecake Factory. This one and the one in KoP. I was amazed by how good the food was when I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience at KoP, so I was thrilled to find out they were opening one up in center city.  I went a couple days after they opened and I was fairly upset with the quality. The pasta was just not as good and the hibachi steak was not as flavorful. The mashed potatoes had huge chunks in it, which kind of ruined that. I figured, they just opened up so maybe they will get better with time. Went there a second time hoping for a better experience but my hopes were shot down. The service was a little worse, which was already a bad start. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta this time and it was not as great as I was hoping. The pasta was decent but the chicken was incredibly bland. My girlfriend got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo which is a let down. The shrimp was burnt and the steak was too salty. The mashed potatoes once again had huge chunks. Is it that hard to make proper mashed potatoes? We left that night with a Kahlua cheesecake to go because we had to get out of there. I don't know whether it's the thought of that Cheesecake Factory being a disappointment compared to the one at KoP that made the cheesecake a little worse or the fact that it was actually worse.

As his dumpster fire of an NFL career was coming to an end circa 2012, reports began to surface that the former Eagles QB and third overall pick of the 2006 NFL draft was known to spend upwards of $5,000 per week at the Cheesecake Factory. I know NFL players enjoy the lavish lifestyle, but come on, $5,000 per week at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY? You're a millionaire. Treat yourself. That's like if I went out tonight and spent $200 at Taco Bell (I've come close).  Sources now say Vince Young is now working at an undisclosed Cheesecake Factory location as a short order line cook. Get 'em, Vince! This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. Not sure how I was able to avoid them for this long. You know, there's a lot to like about this place. The dining room is pretty darn impressive. Lots of head room.  Pressed for time, my buddies and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table. Service was friendly, though not the most attentive. As a fairly outgoing group, we were able to get the attention of the bartenders. But I noticed a lot of quiet couples around us being completely neglected. This was actually making ME feel a little awkward, so I made it a point to tell the bartender not to focus solely on my group and to help the other people standing around. Not sure why this was necessary ... you'd think they would do this on their own. Food portions are HUGE! Has anyone else ever ordered the chicken fingers here? You seriously get like two pounds of chicken and another half pound of mashed potatoes. Seriously. It's obscene. In a good way, of course. Would I come back? Sure.

We walked a couple blocks over, took the elevator upstairs and were greeted by a hangry mob. Well, basically. It was midday on a Saturday and this place was bursting at the seams with people waiting for tables. Originally we planned to eat-in until we heard about the crazy wait time. No thanks. Fortunately, they do have a to-go counter. While the process of ordering was a bit unorganized and the staff unfriendly, we were able to snag our cheesecake slices and leave within about 10 minutes. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough, and it was pretty darn good. I don't want to consider the calorie count on that thing...but if you're in the mood for an extra sweet snack, you could very well visit this accessible spot.

They were done rehearsals and gearing up for a performance in a few hours. Cheesecake Factory with their large menu and portions is a good pick because everyone can find something they like... Since it was lunch time we could order the lunch portions and go easy on the pockets.  I'd never been to this location.. So one thing I will say is coming in and seeing the hostess stand on the first floor with no one standing there threw us off a bit, sent one of the girls up on the elevator and she ushered us to come up... As we rode up, we saw the hustle a bustle that is Cheesecake Factory. They didn't at all seem annoyed or flustered when we told them party of 10... Within about 10 minutes we were seated. We had one waitress that took care of us.. I like that a lot better than having 2 for either side of the table, and she did an awesome job keeping everything straight. We all pretty much knew what we wanted since we needed time for food to digest and settle prior to show time that was one of the requirements, lol know what u want and no dessert. I hated the no dessert rule after all it was Cheesecake Factory, but hey the food was filling.  I ordered the salmon off of the gluten free menu, swapped the broccoli for asparagus, so glad I made that choice, I must say some of the best asparagus I've had in a long time.

I'm definitely a fan, I usually end up here for convenience rather than choice, but this location is awesome. There was a slight mishap where when two of the girls ordered pasta with red sauce they were asked if they wanted tomatoes, so given the choice they said no, but it came out with tomatoes, when they questioned it, our waitress took it back but then came back saying that's just how it comes..

Then after we ordered they brought it the wrong order to 2 out of the 3 of us. So while one is us was eating for 20 minutes the rest were just waiting for their correct order. The. Our waitress couldn't remember anything we were asking for and had to repeat everything to her. Then she left in the middle of purser vice and we got a second server. This server was nice and then we asked if we could split the bill. She was accommodating until she gave us the checks, we gave her out cards and then when we got the receipts the amount had changed on out of our checks from originally 35 to 42!! How the hell does that happen? Please explain how you randomly add 2 sodas to a check that was already correct before we gave you out cards. Then she wanted to know If that extra was ok or does she need to get her manager... Um yes get your manager.. Then she returned with 6$ in cash  without the manager... Mind you the overcharge was 7$ . At this point we were so frustrated we just took our tip back and left.

Second star is for the service. Nice and friendly. Third star is for cheese cake. Should try the mango key lime one. Beautiful cake comes with multiple layer of flavors, tastes, and textures. Minus 2 stars because the grilled food was horrible. I ordered KOBE Style burger with Medium cook. They handed me a burned well done and dried meat. I called the server to request a new one. My friends already finished their meals and I had to wait for my burger in 20 mins. Second time was less burn but still complete well done and dried. They use gas grill and you can smell the gas on every bite. I wanted throw up after a first bite. The sever was so nice so I just let it go and pack it home. Of course, I will throw it away. Cannot eat it. My friend's pork chop dish was $23 and it was burned as well. The burn layer was like 1/8 inches. She had to cut it out and eat it without requesting to change her dish. In general, it was overpriced for the quality of food.

For my drink, I ordered a glass of Moscato.  Unfortunately they were out of it. :(  So, I ordered a glass of Riesling.  It was pretty good.  The only thing i didn't like was the fact that the wine glasses were so large, yet they only filled it up halfway!  I guess that's to make you order another glass.  Who knows.  Needless to say, for $9.50, that was my only glass of wine for the night.  Grade: B My appetizer was the Fried Zucchini.  I asked for mine without cheese and marinara sauce instead of ranch dressing.  I was looking forward to it, since this is one of my favorite appetizers in the world, and everywhere I have gone either took it off of their menus or it has been absolutely horrendous!  Well...The Cheesecake factory made me happy!  Thick pieces of Zucchini sticks, light and crispy breading and wasn't served as a greasy mess!  The people I shared them with agreed that they were very good.  The portion was very large.  I ended up ordering more to go with my main course.  Grade: A+ My main course for dinner was Fish and Chips.  Well.  I can honestly say that I've had better in less-costing restaurants.  The flsh was fried nice and crispy, but it was very bland.  The fries were good.  Grade: C Dessert:  I ordered the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake for myself and the Godiva Cheesecake for my friend.  Both were awesome, like always!  Grade: A+ The only thing that I can completely say that I was truly upset about was the salad that I ordered to-go.  It was the French Country Salad with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, fresh beets, goat cheese, candied pecans and vinaigrette.  I was very disappointed when I got home and opened up the salad.  Extremely wilted lettuce.  There were only a couple pieces of beets and they looked dried out.  We won't even talk about the asparagus.  About 2 goat cheese crumbles.  All I can say is that this was a major disappointment for the amount that it cost.

I have gone once by myself around Five PM and it was very busy but my experience was very good. had to wait a bit for drinks sometimes but considering thre rush the delay was understandable. This time i went with a friend and we showed up right after Four PM. Big difference in the room. Not nearly as busy or loud. I'll just list the items that we ordered along with their happy hour price-Chicken Pot Stickers ($5.50), Crispy Crab Bites ($7.50,real crab meat), The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.50-had two orders in house and my friend ordered one to go, that's how great the dip is. Intoxicating and addictive!), Dynamite Tempura Shrimp ($6.95-not as spicy as I had been led to think they would be but good flavor nonetheless. If you order the house wine, be it white, red, or zinfandel, (I had my usual Merlot) the price is $5.50. Name brand wines will cost more (Like my friend's Moscato @ $9.50). You can get beer for $3-4 and drinks such as Long Island Iced teas, mojitos, and margaritas for $5.50! There are so many appetizers that we didn't get to try this time nut are looking forward to on our next trip. The price is right and the earlier you come the better the service will be. After five it can get busy so things will take longer. Wanted to also mention our server Craig M. who answered our questions and, if didn't know the answer, he would go and find out. He was friendly and patient, even bringing us fresh, warm bread when the first basket came out cold and hard. Thanks Craig!

The manager acknowledged that there had just been extermination. At that point we all opted to leave the establishment as none of us had much of an appetite after that incident. I highly recommend that extermination be done after hours and allow enough time so that bugs such as roaches be totally eliminated before the establishment reopens.

355,Skyla C.,"Philadelphia, United States",64,156,1570.0,2.0,2016-12-26,Cheesecake factory has been around for the longest but we decided to dine in tonight because the waiting line at max brenner was just too crazy . I first had cheesecake factory when it was opened years ago back at home in Boston. I never really liked the food there . 5 stars goes towards their cheesecakes though. So we decided to give cheesecake factory a second chance.  When we first walked in hostess greeted us but gave us a weird look instead of a smile . Points off there . And then told us there's about 15 to 20 mins wait and we said okay that's fine. She didn't lock us in the computer at first until another  group came in after us and see us just standing there. We then was given a number beeper and told we could go right ahead upstairs . Surprising the wait wasn't long . So that was good . Took us a bit to look over the menu because there was a variety to choose from. So our waitress came and took our orders for drinks and apps . We decided to get buffalo Blast and dynamite shrimp for appetizers (as pictured) . The Buffalo blast was good . The dynamite shrimp was okay. It could use a little more flavor . For entrée I decided to go with the chicken marsala and my boyfriend got the meatloaf. When the drink came she only brought my boyfriend drink and told me my drink will be out shortly. I thoughts all the drinks supposed to come out at the same time and not just one and while the other wait for theirs . But okay. The first appetizer came out which was the Buffalo blast half way eating it my drink still hasn't come yet and I was thirsty after a few bites . My drink didn't come out until my entrée came out which was probably 20 mins after . Sign of bad service because the couple next to us ordered drinks and all their drinks came out right away by a different waitress . After a few bites of our food we was ready to leave because my boyfriend didn't like how his food taste and my chicken marsala was sweet and the sauce tasted burnt while I was eating it . I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so we just asked the waitress to packed the food to go . I should of just stick to my instance and went elsewhere because the food hasn't meet our expectations . I won't return to dine in but definitely for the cheesecakes.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20,2.16,2.6,2.716,2.152,2.4240000000000004

I normally only get cheesecake while i;m here but the adventurous side of me said ""bruh, lets get some carrotcake"".  And lemme tell ya...the Carrotcake was arguably the best I've had. I've had some good carrotcake in my short life, but the cheescake factory carrot cake was HUGE and very moist! Well worth the $8 value!  The Nachos are really...really..really good, too. It's usually all I can handle unless i'm sharing some with my greedy friends, i mean hungry friends. I'm actually going to attempt to try the chicken casear salad again because I'm confident it was a one-time thang.

I would say it's consistent with my expectations for Cheesecake Factory restaurants in general. The server was very nice and responsive. The food was also good. We had a couple of apps: chicken tacquitos and the buffalo chicken nuggets. Both were good but if I had to pick I'd go with the tacquitos.  For my main course I had the Thai chicken with mango. As always with CKF the portion was big and I am now busting at the seams. I thought the chicken and the sauce were good.  Surprisingly enough I did not have any Cheesecake!

56,Joanna C.,"New York, NY",130,19,37.0,1.0,2017-09-29,"Came here with my coworker tonight and the food was badly prepared. There was 5 of us and 4 of us ordered the ribeye. We asked for one well done, one medium rare, and 2 medium. The well done one came out burnt my coworker kept saying it taste bitter because of the burnt charcoal on the steak. My husband medium and other coworker was both well done. My coworker didn't mind but we had to send my husband steak back. There is no way I'm paying $30 for a steak not done the way I want it. My medium rare, came medium, no pink at all. It was late, around 12am, if it was any other time I would definitely send all four plates back to the kitchen. They need to hire new cooks or train their staff better on how to prepare steak. And my husband didn't even get his second steak because the manager came over and said it was the last piece of steak in the house. He didn't even seem apologetic or anything. And when we decide to change my husband entree to a pasta dish. When I asked the manager if he could not charge us for the steak and charge us for the pasta instead he seemed annoyed.

The first thing I noticed was that when our waiter brought over our water there were lemon slices floating in it. I'm not a health freak but I always prefer my lemon wedges on the side of the glass because who knows if they even washed them? Anyway it was just a passing thought and I didn't think anything of it.  I ordered the pasta carbonara and immediately I knew there was something wrong. The sauce tasted so bland, except where the waitress grated Parmesan cheese over. I added salt and pepper and there was barely any difference. Regardless, I finished about half of it before my boyfriend and I decided to take the rest of our food to go.  I got home and I felt really sick all of a sudden. I went to bed early and when I got up for work the next morning I had an upset stomach. I called out from work and thank God that I did because a half hour later I threw up all the fluids I drank that morning. I threw up two more times afterwards and had an upset stomach two more times later in the day.  I didn't associate this with anything until I called my boyfriend at work and he said it sounded like I had food poisoning. I read up on the symptoms of it and he was right. I was shaking, feeling feverish, and my hands and feet were tingling. I had lost so much fluids that every time I stood up I started seeing black and white and had to hold onto something.  My boyfriend has been in the industry for more than 20 years, owned restaurants, been a partner, and been a general manager. He said that when sauces are left out too long, they lose their taste, and that was probably why I got so sick. He said he noticed me seasoning my dish with salt and was surprised as places like the Cheesecake Factory have dishes with high calorie counts and are already so flavorful to the point of being unhealthy.  I called the restaurant and told Anthony the GM what I had experienced and he offered to give me a gift card. I said no thank you and would prefer a partial refund for at least my portion of the meal. He said that it was not possible. I even offered to bring in the food we had taken home for him to inspect but he said it was not necessary.  Due to his lack of assistance, I called the guest services line in California and they were much more kind even though they still refused to offer a refund, though they did offer to look into the issue.

14,Kareem S.,"University City, Philadelphia, PA",15,5,3.0,4.0,2018-01-06,"Great Location it's spacious, and offers a nice view of Center City Philly, depending on where you are seated. The atmosphere is pretty nice as well, and so is the staff. Also the menu is pretty solid, I love their salmon, brown rice, and broccoli, and Cheesecake for desert is very rich and tasty. I normally go for happy hour because I never experience a long wait during those hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia,2.96,2.76,2.688,,2.84

Covered in crumbs and food smears. I cleaned my chair with a napkin before sitting because it was so dirty. Our water had chunks of food or something in it. Dirty tables, dirty walls, dirty seats. Food was awful. Bread chewy like it had been frozen. Salt at the table was stuck together because it had gone bad.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia,2.92,2.73,2.688,,2.806
