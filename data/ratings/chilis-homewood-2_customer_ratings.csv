38,Seung P.,"Birmingham, AL",11,34,21.0,1.0,2014-02-13,"This establishment absolutely fails operations management 101.  Not only does it not follow well-established rules for customer service (protip: when a customer has been there for an hour and his order is nowhere to be found, do NOT default to making idiotic excuses; it'll only make the customer even more upset), the excuses that the waitstaff and the management give for their failings are out-and-out lies.  Example: I recently ordered and received (1 hour later) a watered-down excuse of a margarita that had clearly been sitting on the counter for ... oh, say an hour or so.  The excuse that immediately flew out of the waitress' mouth?  ""The kitchen is backed up"".  The last time I checked, drinks don't sit on a countertop because of something that the KITCHEN is doing.  That's squarely the fault of the waitstaff.  And on top of that ... when we did receive food, it appeared fully cooked ... and was completely cold to the touch.  I don't think you can chalk that up to a problem with the kitchen, folks. This tendency to make inane excuse after infuriating excuse after OUTRIGHT LIE when things aren't working right is something that absolutely mystifies me about Southern culture.  This is not the first place my family has encountered this attitude -- it seems to be widespread in doctors' offices, other restaurants, and even grocery stores in this area.  Who are you trying to make feel better, people?  Yourselves?  Because all you're doing is making an already irritated paying customer even more irritated at you.  While it's amusing to watch for maybe half a second, after that ... well ... I don't think one (here's looking at you, Chili's management) ought to be paid for having the attitude (or the business acumen) of a chicken with its head cut off. In summary, avoid this place like the plague if you want decent service (or decent food).  For crying out loud, even the McDonald's or the Taco Bell a few blocks away do a better job than this.  Better yet, stay at home and make yourself a packet of instant ramen noodle.  That's still better (and probably more hygenic) than eating at this irredeemable establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2?start=40,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003
49,Allison W.,"Southern Pines, NC",0,5,3.0,1.0,2014-02-19,"If I could give this Chili's location zero stars, I would. I used to travel out of town weekly for several years, and I can say with authority that this is the worst Chili's I have ever eaten at in at least 20 states. We ate once in the restaurant and once tried to get take-out. The restaurant is filthy. I don't just mean food on the floor and sticky tables; I saw into their kitchen while waiting for take-out and saw food and unidentified filth covering the floors and most surfaces. Kitchen staff were sitting on and lounging around food prep counters. While eating in the restaurant, problems included: very slow service, inaccurate orders, cold food, and hearing other angry customers complain loudly about the same issues (and in 3 cases, seeing them storm out). Our server was very nice, but we got the impression that the kitchen staff made her job nearly impossible. Knowing this restaurant's difficulties with speed, I called ahead by 45 minutes for take-out on another night. When I arrived, I then had to wait another HOUR for our food. During that time, 2 other customers began shouting at the staff because they had been waiting longer than I had, and both ended up leaving with no food. We finally got our food, but upon arriving home, we discovered that all three salads were incorrect, did not include the meat listed in the menu, and had no salad dressing. I called the restaurant, and they were very polite and apologetic. I was assured that they would have the salad dressing and meats ready and waiting when I returned. So, I drove all the way back to Chili's to discover that nothing was waiting for me. After waiting an additional 45 MINUTES for just salad dressing and grilled salad meat, I told them I was leaving. At that point they finally brought out some salad dressing and the meat for ONE of our three salads. The dressing was not even what was listed in the menu for our salads. We will never eat at this restaurant again. I have to say that throughout our visits, the servers were very nice. However, I get the impression that their managers and kitchen staff do such a poor job that the servers can barely get the food out to customers. I don't see how they stay in business when so many people give up and just leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2?start=60,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003

Waited a long time for appetizer--which was cold and before they could take the plate off of the table we have....you guessed it cold food. My husband got pork carnitas and the plate was barely sizzling. I got the ribs with fries and you guessed it, they were cold. The best part of the meal was my strawberry lemonade. It was good.

64,Brian C.,"Birmingham, AL",115,387,148.0,1.0,2014-04-15,"We entered the restaurant at the height of the lunch hour.  It should have been packed given the location.  Instead it was running at about 1/10th capacity.  Not a good sign.  We came in at the same time as a young woman who wanted to apply for a job.  The hostess greeted her, ignored us and disappeared for 3 or 4 minutes to introduce the girl to the manager.  When the hostess returned, there was no acknowledgement that she kept us waiting.  We were seated at a table by the kitchen.  Sitting there, we quickly figured out why the location is dead...  The ceilings are covered with dust around vents, the floors dirty, and the baseboards disgusting. Foul odors periodically wafted through the dining room while country music and bad singing came from the kitchen.  I looked over to see the manager leading a sing-a-long with the staff as they stood waiting for food that comes out at a snails pace. After waiting 30 minutes for a burger and a flatbread in a mostly empty restaurant, the manager stopped the sing-a-long to ask how everything was.  Finding we had yet to get food she went into the kitchen to reprimand the staff for slow service.  Unfortunately she is seen less as a leader and more like a playmate as she had to call the cook's name three times before he would acknowledge her.   This location should be slamming at this hour with thousands of office workers in a ten minute radius.  Unfortunately they are dying due to lackluster service and a disregard for cleanliness.  The health rating was a 92 and frankly I have no idea how or why.  The longer you look around, the more grime and dust you see. The burger was ordered medium, it came out well.  It was missing the jalepeño slices and jack cheese mentioned on the menu.  My wife's flatbread was fine.  Normally I would have sent the burger back to get the missing ingredients but in this place, I thought that was a bad idea.   The manager comped one of our meals without asking due to the long wait and noise coming from the kitchen.  Lazy staff, sloppy execution and a total lack of professionalism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2?start=20,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003,1.3480000000000003

I know he was probably busy, but BOTH of them disappeared on us. I had to ask to have my drink refilled, get more napkins, and no one ever asked if we were ok after we were served our food. In addition, thee food that day was pretty bad. My guests dish was too spicy (spicier than usual) and mine was more spicy than I remember. I must say, after this experience, I have not gone back.  The time I was there before this, the waitress was rude and put off by any conversation (my mom and I).  She also disappeared on us and I had to bother the host for different things.  Overall, I really think management is doing a poor job of training there staff. I think the manager there likes to hire young pretty girls and train them improperly.

She got really upset and asked why, I explained about the horrible food, the roach, the dirty restaurant and she told me that was disgusting and I should have told her. She asked me to wait so she could get her manager.  I declined because unfortunately I had already eaten the food and I had already paid, there was nothing they could do for me. If you are so worried about people turning in bad surveys maybe you should clean your establishment, get pest control and serve better quality meals.

My husband and I ordered curbside Saturday night (5/28/2016). We love us a good Chili's meal -- but this location continues to disappoint time and time again. We ordered right around 7:30pm and we arrived at Chilies right around 8:10pm to pick up. We always do the $20 meal for 2 -- I ordered the 6oz sirloin, corn on the cobb, and added a shrimp skewer (for $4.99); my husband ordered the Chicken fajitas, and we got the Texas cheese fries as our appetizer.  When I got to the counter, the young man was polite, checked me out, told me he was waiting on my husband's fajitas and did I need a drink. I politely accepted the drink offer and thought, okay! this going to be good! -- Boy was I wrong! It took another 15-20 minutes to receive our food and by the time we got home (which we only live like 5 mins from this location) the food was already cold. the young man who originally helped me looked really busy; but i don't understand why we had to wait that long when we had given them 45min to prepare anyway. So...onto the food. The only thing that was good were the chicken fajitas. They gave a good portion size and the chicken was seasoned nicely. (there were peppers with the chicken. they don't give much on the fajita shells though -- we found ourselves wishing we had 2.3 more). They didn't give any lettuce with the fajitas either; which was kind of a bummer.  The rest -- it was edible. I ordered my steak medium rare; and i am so glad I did because the steak i received was definitely more towards the medium well side. the steak was cold and tasted ok. (i could do a better steak myself). The shrimp that i paid an extra $5 for were a JOKE. they were the tiniest shrimp I have ever seen served with a meal -- and were also; just okay. (at least they weren't rubbery!) Corn on the cob was mushy; but i love corn so I still ate it.  The texas cheese friends were stuck to the aluminum foil they were placed on. completely dried and no telling how long it sat there waiting for the rest of our food to be done. we had to peel aluminum foil off the bottom of the fries and the taste was bland.   overall -- very poor experience and we will not be back to this location. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2,1.52,1.52,1.52,1.5720000000000003,1.5200000000000002

So, tonight I find myself in Birmingham, AL (in the Homewood area), and decided to go to the Chili's here for dinner with a large group. Wow - was THAT a mistake.

I had a fish taco - fish was stinky and old.  Couldn't eat it.  Shrimp taco?  Shrimp was rancid, with a horrid bitter taste.  Rice was ice cold.  I sent it back and couldn't stomach the thought of trying anything else from there.  My friend ordered chicken tacos, which at first seemed fine until he found rock-hard shards of something we couldn't even identify.  Could have been dried out chicken pieces, or maybe bones...had no idea.  My other friend ordered only a salad with chicken, which came out after everyone else was finished eating at our table.

6,Katie T.,"Longwood, FL",113,216,268.0,4.0,2017-06-16,"If you're looking for good food and good service for a reasonable price and a relaxing atmosphere (bonus points if you live on or near Lakeshore), this is your spot! I stopped here with some family for a late dinner when most other places were closing and Chili's had no problem accommodating us. They had a killer deal going on that was two full size entrees and an appetizer for $22! My friend and I both ordered the fajitas, he got the chicken and I got the pork. Each of our dishes came with three tortillas, grilled onions and bell peppers, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa, black beans, and rice! The black beans and rice were some of the best and most flavorful I've ever had, I ate them separately because I liked them both so much individually! For our appetizer, we each got a side salad. Mine came with onions, cheese comma and ranch. Our waitress was a super sweetheart in the worked very hard to make sure that we had everything we needed. All in all, it was a great experience and value for the money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
0,Lucy T.,"Birmingham, AL",272,208,276.0,4.0,2017-08-23,"This was my first time at a Chili's in almost 20 years, and I was quite impressed. I came here for lunch and was quickly seated and served. I had a lunch combo that started with a small fresco salad. It was very fresh, nutritious, and came with a crumbled queso cheese. I loved it! By the time I was about done with it, my quesadilla and side of fries came. Fries come with the quesadilla which is a rather odd pairing, but I won't complain. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla which was a bit interesting. It had a lot of peppers and not as much cheese as I was expecting. The fries were the really good thick cut fries I enjoy. I didn't see any ketchup around, and they could have been a tad warmer. I had probably the sweetest waitress ever! She was very welcoming, made suggestions, and made me feel very well taken care of. I highly recommend going during their lunch if you like plenty of options! The menu was huge!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

I ordered veggie fajitas expecting your standard chilis fajitas but when it came it was grilled asparagus, whole tomatoes, and an uncut veggie patty. At first I was like okay whatever I'll eat it but it tasted like trash so I couldn't do it. Don't go here. Don't. Do.

1,Tom T.,"Longwood, FL",6,30,10.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"Doesn't even rate one star...worst experience I've ever had just trying to get into a restaurant.  Only a few tables were occupied in the restaurant but there were several people waiting at the entrance for someone to assist them.  No one showed up to greet at the front for several minutes. So we checked in the bar, which has always had open seating. There was plenty of room at the bar and several tables empty, but the response from the extremely rude person behind the bar was along the lines of ""if no one put you here, don't be here"".  We, along with several others then left the establishment.  We will surely never return to this location,  and will probably never walk in a Chili's again, which is sad as we usually like it, but this was further over the line than anything I've seen before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
