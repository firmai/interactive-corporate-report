Also, the alcohol selection is phenomenal, especially if you're a big fan of beer.  Our server was extremely cool and very knowledgeable on the selection of both food and drinks. Plus, she actually checked up on us as often as necessary and make sure everything is okay. (I wish I knew her name so I could mention her here!)

158,Dequan S.,"Town of Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY",16,5,4.0,1.0,2016-10-12,"On the day of 10/12/16 I ate here at Bj's Restaurant in the new Green Acres Commons. As you walk in the atmosphere is pretty decent, but its way smaller inside then how it looks from the outside. The wait to get a table was about 3 minutes which that was perfect timing because I was hungry. The Hostess seated us at our table and the seats was dirty. It was French Fries on the seats and she was going to get it and i picked it up and handed to her. (The Bust boy needs to do a thorough checking of the table and seats). A couple of minutes later Damali came over to introduce herself as our waitress, very sweet young lady and might I add she is very knowledgable about everything that was being served at the restaurant. We ordered different types of sample beers so we can try, but when I looked and seen Damali put the order in, the bartender took a very long time just to get the samples ready. He was to busy talking and not concentrated on the task at hand. Damali seen that we was getting a little ansi and came over to distract us and have a little side conversation. Which it worked and I commend her for that because she's concerned about the customers well being. We finally get the samples and picked what we wanted. She went and put the order in and we had to yet again wait along time and not to mention this is what they specialize in (Crafted Beers). Our food comes before the beer gets to the table. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and my friend order the Chicken Alfredo. My salad was very good but his Chicken Alfredo was dry, meaning they was VERY stingy with the Alfredo sauce and some of the pieces of chicken was hard. All in all I will NOT be coming back to this restaurant because I feel the service was a 4 out of 10 and i'm only being nice because of Damali and her customer service. The bartenders LACK the sense of urgency, not to mention the place was not even packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=180,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003

75,David M.,"Jamaica, NY",2,3,,4.0,2016-10-14,"Based off of the experiences I had with restaurants around this area (namely, Bronx BBQ), I kept my expectations for this brewhouse bottom-of-the-barrel low. This was the right move... because I was all the more pleased when the place turned out to be pretty good.  When I first walked in, I noted that the dinihg space was much smaller than it appeared from the outside. This was fine though, as what was there was well lit and smartly decorated. The service, from hostess to waitress to busboy, was very helpful and cordial. There was this one server who gave us this educational speech on the hops in certain beers and how it would make the jalapenos on the Crispy Flatbread Nachos more bearable.  Speaking of the beers itself, I found their in-house brewed pumpkin ale to be a little on the watery side, but my girl liked it. I had the Nutty Brewnette and thought it was pretty good, but nothing too remarkable. The food took a little while to get there, but when it did we were fully satisfied. My burger was well-cooked, and my girl had no complaints about the chicken tacos. I give BJ Brewhouse a light 4, but considering the green acres area it may as well be a perfect 5. Strong recommendation for those who find themselves in this mall area and want something other than watered down Applebee's drinks and abysmal service at that horrible Olive Garden.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=80,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

We started with the avocado egg rolls which were delicious and reminded me of the ones from the Cheesecake Factory. The deep dish pizza was delicious and a must try. The kale salad and the salmon with quinoa was delicious as well. There is an extensive menu to choose from. You can get anything from burgers, to pasta and pizza. The have nice roomy booths.

I would absolutely return here for the food, beer and specials. The wait staff was very apologetic and nice but they need a few more weeks to get the timing of the food down.

27,Angelo B.,"Valley Stream, NY",58,125,166.0,5.0,2016-10-21,"What a great addition to the area. We were seated promptly, and everyone was so friendly.(hopefully this lasts, and it's not just because they just opened) Our server was Bryan and he was very knowledgeable about the beers (do they have to take a beer class prior to working here?)  Told him what I liked and he gave some recommendations, ended up trying the 5oz sampler (4 beers 5oz each)  it was a great idea because we got to sample a bunch of different beers that they have to offer.  The harvest hefeweizen was my favorite of the bunch. It was pretty light and had a good taste. Next favorite was the Jeremiah red, 7.3% alcohol! Good thing I got a sample.  That also was very good but a bit heavy for my taste. The oasis was ok, the only one I wasn't crazy about was the nutty brewnette. It was too heavy for me, plus I still had to get through dinner Note: I don't drink often anymore, so take that into account. Appetizers:  Mozzarella sticks, not bad...the selling point for me was the garlic butter breading. Definitely had a unique (in a good way) taste, the only problem was that the mozzarella was a bit disappointing...maybe a better quality cheese would help put it over the top. Side salad (house salad?)  Disappointing...basically just chopped lettuce with a couple slices of tomato. We can do better than that (the full entree salads looked amazing from the menu though!) on to the entrees! I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. DAMN...that was a good burger, cooked perfectly and the brisket was delicious.  I though maybe between the burger, the brisket, the bacon and the bbq sauce...maybe it would be a bit too much. But they all got along fine, and I really enjoyed it.  Fries were great too!  Thin and crispy. Wife had the salmon quinoa bowl, and was really surprised by how good it was. Kids menu...a bit underwhelming considering the great options for adults. Chicken tenders, burger,corn dogs, kraft mac&cheese... KRAFT MAC&CHEESE? Are we at applebees? C'mon...based on the quality of the food we had...I see no reason why bj's cant make a quality mac& cheese from scratch.  Plus, lets add some more options... Grilled chicken? Fish? Glad to see they have vegetables and fruit as an option so that's a plus. All in all it was an excellent experience,  the atmosphere was great and the servers were very friendly. Our server was especially friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. Will definitely come again to try something else. And to try to make it to dessert, I hear the pizzookie is amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=40,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188

Figured we'd give it a try--had never heard of it, but it definitely has that ""chain"" look at feel (because it is). Huge menu, if you can't find something you want you're not trying hard enough. Just a couple of highlights/lowlights on the food--the root beer glazed boneless wings were surprisingly good. I also enjoyed my baked ziti, it was basically a pizza-tasting ziti in a deep cast iron dish. Disappointed that the mac n cheese on the kids menu was mac-in-the-box, but  my daughter didn't mind. My only complaint, which is a fairly major one, was the service. I get it, they're new, but it's been a month and this isn't this chain's first rodeo. We were there for over two hours on Saturday--we showed up shortly after 5 and didn't leave until after 7. Everything was painfully slow--from the time our name was called to actually being seated, for someone to come by to take our drink order, for the drinks to arrive....it was brutal. Our server was very, very nice, didn't make any mistakes, but the restaurant has some major kinks to work out around timing and staff. Don't know how they'll end up making money if they can't turn over a table in less than two hours. I downloaded their app while we were there--I was able to pay with my phone, add the tip, and leave without having to wait for someone to come back to take the check. You get points per dollar and special offers via the app as well.

The burger was not medium as I asked but rather well done which was alright nonetheless, the salad seemed as it was left in the kitchen waiting for someone to rub it for a while since the dressing had dried up and dropped to the bottom of the plate. The whiskey sour was actually good just took forever to get it, ice was melted as well. The service took forever even though our waiter tried.

Since this was a new place, I went with a simple healthy salad while my family went with the deep dish pizza and a burger.  All of the food was pretty good. The pizza was thick and generously topped with Hawaiian toppings! Pizza was very filling and fresh!  The burger was really good, not very healthy but that translate into delicious pretty much. Fries were very good, usually the separating factor between burgers from other places in comparison.  My salad was the least fun, tasty but very boring and the kale taste overpowered the salad which will probably prevent me from doing it again, doesn't mean it wasn't good, just too kale-y for me.

We asked for replacements and two sets were dirty. This was really disappointing and makes you wonder what else is dirty in this place. We ordered the ""Best Beginnings"" appetizer which was great, I had to ask for plates which should have been automatic. My wife ordered a cocktail which was loaded with alcohol and was undrinkable.

I got the steak, asparagus and fries, my hubby got the ribs and mash, and my 6 year old got the pizza kids meal (his pizza was delish). From the moment we walked in we got off to a bad start due to poor customer service. Here are some tips for management. There is no reason why customer service should be so poor when this location just recently opened.  Tips:  - Have the girls at the front desk greet guests as they walk in. None of the guests were greeted. Also when someone books on the wait list online they are seated quicker.... Inform your customers! It's not fun to see everyone get seated before you and not understand why.  - please have utensils at tables before guests are seated. Also make sure utensils are clean! Not that hard.  - season your steak and ribs, have more Steak sauce a available besides A1. Everyone does not eat A1 - wait time was not long, and drinks were very strong. Keep that up!

My family member's burger had no cheese and I was not brought the pickles I requested.  My family member had asked for mozzarella cheese originally.  When we said there is not cheese on this burger the waitress said oh we don't have that type of cheese.  Uh you couldn't tell us that before??  Okay we asked for different cheese, a refreshing of our drinks and pickles.  The waitress brought the burger and drinks but no pickles.  After eating, we wanted to order dessert.  The waitress took our empty plates and said she would be right back.  She did not come back for about 10 minutes which was very annoying.  I then started to notice that most of the waiters and waitresses were all basically standing around talking with each other.  We were right near the registers and we noticed there were about 6 workers just standing, talking and playing around for the rest of the time we were there.  I finally spotted my waitress and noticed she was busy talking to another worker near the kitchen door!!  She finally came back and we ordered dessert.  We told her we were sharing dessert.  She forgot extra spoons and had to go back to get spoons which of course took her a couple of minutes.  She never came back to get the check.  I asked someone else to do it for us.  She finally came back when we started putting on our coats and she asked could she help us pay.  We told her we did already.  I did not leave her a great tip which was interesting for us because we tip very well when we have great service.  Her lost ( I never did get those pickles) but the manager really needs to either toughen up on these workers or hire some people that will pay attention to the paying customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=200,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.54,3.3600000000000003

Then the bartender who seemed overwhelmed with minimal amounts of customers took another 10 minutes to ask me if I would like a drink. Then, I kid you not! I watched him do other things before another 10 minutes or so went by and I finally got my soda. Another 10 minutes go by and I finally get my food. And it's wrong! They gave me skinny fries, ( MC Donald's are better! ) And the burger was cooked  medium! What was I to do? Almost no time left for lunch now! I ate what I could and left the rest. No one ever came back to ask me if everything came out alright. The flavor of the burger was good. That's the only reason I even gave this place 2 stars. But let's be real.

The 2 times i ordered take out my fries were cold and un-enjoyable. Staff and customer service at the bar and front are good, but take out counter can only be described as horrific.

Then when you receive the meager portions of your sides (compared to bar or dine in) the other portion is cold. I ordered chips and guacamole once.

I highly suggest not coming here on a Saturday night or on any other busy day because the staff is obviously incompetent when it comes to servicing a packed restaurant. First off, we waited for 20 minutes for a table only to see people who arrived after us getting seated first. Whatever, we're seated and out waiter comes over, who by the way has VERY little social skills, and takes our order. However, we waited 30 minutes for appetizers and our entrees came out first. Our waiter forgot about our appetizers and went to the kitchen to get it, but by that time the appetizers were cold. Fine, we begin to eat. I take one bite out of my burger only to spit it out. The chefs vastly undercooked my burger (Hickory Brisket Burger). Literally, it was red inside and extremely mushy, any sane person could see it was not cooked at all. The waiter comes over and sends it back, saying that the chefs are overwhelmed and that it is not his fault. The new burger arrives, but another waiter brings it and doesn't know where my table is. He goes around asking other tables until he reaches us (I was too annoyed to say anything at that point). Anyway, by the time my new burger arrives, the person I was with was already full - so we just brought the food home. My previous experiences here have been good, but this is the first time I came and it was packed.

Place was already busy but we were seated after a quick check for a table.  Server came quickly and provided menus and took our drink order.  That's where quick service ended. We didn't receive drinks for another ten minutes or so. He took our meal orders then. I'm not disparaging our server at all- he was very friendly, had a great memory (another giant brain who takes orders without paper and ink), and got us refills when we were low; I just think he was busy. Food came out twenty minutes later, so, that wasn't bad.  Food was pretty good.  Picky Pete's quinoa (right!? He got quinoa!?) was borderline cold but the accompanying chicken was flavored well so he muddled through.  My baked ziti was huge and chock full of meatball, pepperoni and sausage.  If I wanted to nitpick, they should salt the pasta water but, it was good overall.  Teen got a hot ham and cheese with fries and it was demolished.  The fries are awesome.  Picky Pete, Jr. got chicken fingers with fries and they passed muster.   Had to wait to put in our dessert order and wait even longer to get it. But, it was worth it.  We each got a mini Pizookie- chocolate chip, double chocolate, salted caramel and monkey bread and they were all as good as the next.  I don't think you can go wrong. 3 adult entrees, 1 kid meal and pizookie, trio pizookie dessert, 4 soft drinks, before tip: $70 and change.

35,William B.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,9,35.0,1.0,2017-03-10,"I always wanted to try this restaurant out. So one day while I was nearby I decided to stop by. I walked in and nobody is at the front to seat me, so I walk over to the bar and sit down. Mind you there's so many workers I couldn't believe it. All of them clustered in the corner talking amongst themselves. Two bartenders are here, I'm sitting for a couple mins nobody greets me.. finally the girl comes over talking very loud to the other bartender about how she's about to end her shift and literally throws me a menu and doesn't say anything then runs away. Doesn't asks me if I need anything to drink, doesn't tell me about any specials for the day, or happy hour. At this point I should have walked out or talked to the manager, but surely it couldn't get any worse. Now I'm sitting there reading the menu and of course I'd love a water or a drink, the bartender walks past countless times and doesn't ask if I need a water or anything to drink.. I'm one of three people at the bar, so it's not like he's busy. Finally a miracle happened. He made eye contact and said ""Hey"" to me after I stared him down for a few minutes. So I knew this was probably going to be my only chance to order so I took the leap. I blurted out my order and as I'm doing so he's walking away.. I was only able to get my food order in since he walked away, now I had to wait till he's close by to get his attention for a drink. Now as I grab his attention for a drink I tell him I want a water and a beer, but what a surprise the guy walks away as I'm ordering that too. Finally the food arrives, food looks great. I wouldn't have anything to complain about if I loved my meals prepared under the Pacific Ocean. The food was overloaded with salt. Now in the middle of the meal I see a tap handle with a pear on it, it struck my interest since I've made ciders before and I've never saw that brand of cider before. By now I'm a pro at this so I grab the bartenders attention once again and ask if I could try the cider. He says sure, now all I want is a reasonable amount so I can taste the cider, he grabs me a glass and barely pours enough to cover the bottom of the glass. Doesn't even tell me the name of the company or asks if I want a glass of it.. He just walks away as if he's trained to do so. Finally after being done with my meal nobody came to take it away or ask if I'd like anything else. It's such a shame, the customer service and the quality of the food. This place is so nice on the inside, the music wasn't too loud, and they had so many great local beers. I would absolutely love it here if they service and food had an upgrade. This place at least needs to make some serious change to the staffing because the experience I had and what I saw was the worst I've ever seen. I will never be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=40,2.6,3.02,3.02,1.988,2.8520000000000003

So now we order the main course waited 42 minutes for it I ordered the rack of ribs with mash and seasonal veggies . The ribs and mash were good but the veggies smell so bad and I tried one and it taste like plastic I told my server can you smell this and his response was I'm not aloud to smell food so instead of bringing me fresh veggies he brings me a soda and says this is on the house like who order soda we were drinking wine .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=100,2.52,2.99,2.99,2.216,2.8020000000000005

96,Jacqueline D.,"Pine Mountain, GA",0,43,2.0,1.0,2017-04-03,"Honestly this is probably one of my worst restaurant experiences. This place has lots of potential but is awful from beginning to end. Though half the tables were empty we waited 20 Minutes to be seated, then 20 Minutes for our drink order. Then 2/3 got our drink order and we finally ordered. We waited 45 minutes for our meal and finally went to the bar to ask about the third persons drink which it turns out had been there the whole time and we now had a watered down margarita. The pizzas came. Wrong order. Sent it back apparently the waitress put in the right order but they did it wrong. One pizza came back correct but missing one ingredient which they eventually brought after we had almost finished the pizza (spinach in a bowl of butter) and asked about twice. The third person who didn't receive her drink til the food came out had to wait an additional 20 Minutes after our pizza came out for the Order to be redone and apparently they ran out of large pizzas so had to do a medium. We then waited over 20 minutes after finishing our meal for the check which was incorrect and we were way over charged. We showed the server and she went to correct it and then we received again another incorrect bill. That was then corrected. This is just the main stuff. We never received water refills except when we went to the bar to get them, we were never asked for another drink. And this doesn't begin on the food. The tavern pizza was good. The deep dish was a soggy buttery thick mess of bread with cheese and a few measly toppings.

I would recommend this place because let's be real there aren't that many good places to sit down and be served in this part of town!

After that he came brought us the appetizers we waited over an hour for our food he said the forgot the steak which was mines so they was holding everyones food. We asked to speak to a manger he didn't help us one bit. He only took one order out of the bill I told him I didn't want the steak anymore he brought me the steak and told me to eat it I won't be charged. Then he rushed to the back to get everyone's food we waited 10 minutes for the check and what the manager had done was give us 25% off but still charge us for the steak until we went up and asked him and he didn't want to take it off until he we keep talking to him and he took it off. We spent for then an hour waiting for food while there was other customers waiting for food and they got their for free from the horrible service and we had to pay.

I'm not even Indian and i stated that, then he said ""you're Spanish, oh then you're just black""! First off, who are you to assume my race or tell me how I like my food.

So we're looking at our menu's at the menu's are like textbooks so I'm thinking our waiter probably just giving us some time to make sure we know what we want. 15 minutes later another table's waiter notices us and asks if we wanted water or something. So i'm thinking maybe he's our waiter and will be back to take our orders after he gets the waters. He drops the water off and we wait an additional 25 minutes with all the staff INCLUDING THE MANAGER happily walking passed us. So finally I ask a passing waitress like... sooooo do you know who our waiter/ess is or....???? And she's confused like... wait ya'll was here the whole time and don't have a waiter. She's like going around asking everybody. A different hostess comes to the table and is like. ""So ya'll don't got no waiter? We're like no. she's like how long ya'll been waiting? We're like about 30 minutes. She's like who was your host? We describe the girl. She was like ""WOWWWW THAT'S AMAZING"" and walked away. So now i'm extremely confused then the waitress I originally asked was like well there's actually no waiters working in this section right now so idk why she sat you here but it's whatever I'll be your waitress do ya'll know what ya'll want to eat?

1,Lauren D.,"New York, NY",161,42,1.0,2.0,2017-07-06,"My boyfriend and I wanted to try somewhere new in the area and since we are both into craft beer, we thought we would try out BJ's. He is big into reviews so he had me check out Yelp prior to us making the drive. I read that the food was pretty good  but the service was terrible. Against our better judgement, I said it couldn't possibly be that bad so we decided to try it, not expecting a world class meal but again.. something new. When we arrived, it wasn't crowded and they sat us right away. This is when it all went downhill. We arrived at 7:45-7:50 and sat at the table for 40 MINUTES without a waiter even looking at us. Both my boyfriend and I are very non-confrontational so we just waited hoping that one of the THREE waiters in our section would come over to us eventually. Mind you - there were four tables seated directly next to us and across from us that were being waited on. Even a couple who came in after us were getting their drink orders taken immediately.  After almost a full hour passed, I finally decided I had to get someone's attention because at this point it was either that or we would have to walk out. As I mentioned, I am not one to be confrontational, especially to people in the service industry but it was getting ridiculous. I went to the front and very politely told the hostess that no one had come to us yet and asked if she could send someone over. She was very nice and apologetic and said she would grab someone. She immediately pulled over one of the waitresses in our section and asked her to take care of us at which time the waitress blatantly SHOOK HER HEAD 'NO' and walked away.  The hostess then had to grab a waitress from another section who had a bunch of tables to attend to on the other side of the restaurant, and ask her to come over to us. She came over  right away and apologized very genuinely. From that point on, the night was fine as the waitress who did take care of us was very nice and attentive and the food was very good. But it did not make up for being ignored for a full hour. We both agreed that although the food was very good we will never be returning to BJ's because of the service alone.

The waitstaff is attentive, but not overbearing. I had the Jambalaya, which was surprisingly good. The portion was American and the taste was just right. My wife had a burger, which was terrible. It was dry and extremely greasy. The waitress probably should have checked on us once to see how the meals were, but that didn't happen.

The boyfriend and me have been here a few times and of all those times we've never had a problem at all. I don't know if it's because we've just been lucky or we always come at the right time.  Regardless we have not had any problems with the staff and if we did have to wait it was because there was a good crowd, which is a reasonable excuse in our books. Whatever the case the ambiance here is perfect for those who love beer and watching sports. If it's not so busy the staff are even nice enough to change the channel to the team of your preference. The food hasn't disappointed us yet, for each time we've visited we pretty much tried something different. I've tried both the Portobello Swiss Burger and the Bacon Guacamole Deluxe Burger. Let's just say the burgers are very generous in portion so come hungry and skip the appetizer. I always order medium well and both times have come out perfect. I've also tried the tacos (shrimp and fried mahi mahi ), which were also bomb! For appetizers we've tried the Avocado Rolls, which were also good and perfect for sharing if you have a group of 4. Our favorite that we always get though are the Rootbeer Glaze Chicken Wings!! :P Definitely a must for every visit we make here. Lastly you can't go wrong here when it comes to the drinks. (Skip the hibiscus iced tea though.) The Berry Burst Cider is my absolute favorite especially because I'm a sucker for the fruity beers.

It's one of the largest book menus I've seen.  By the way this place has no ties or relations to the wholesale club with a similar name.  Let's get down to the brass tax.  Service was very good, friendly and accommodating.  We ordered Grilled Mahi Fish tacos,  A Deep Dish signature pizza and a house salad.  Everything I just listed tasted very good, and fresh.  Wait times for the food were also reasonable considering the place was pretty full on our visit.

172,Marissa M.,"JAMAICA, NY",519,437,1152.0,2.0,2017-09-24,"I was very excited to try BJ's after it opened at the new shopping center Green Acres Commons however, my dining experience here yesterday has helped me reach a final decision to never return again.  When we arrived I was blown away by the size of this place and the modern warehouse fixtures were very alluring. This is your family restaurant meets brew house. I would recommend this place ONLY for the brews. Nothing more. If you want good food, cook at home and buy a 6 pack of Corona. We were greeted by the staff who were pleasant and accommodating. I reviewed the menu like I was studying for the SAT's. I decided on the blended brew ""Red Apple"" a mix of a angry orchard style brew with another house favorite. This was very delicious. Very crisp and it had a nice punch to it. It was the only thing I enjoyed. Our waitress arrived and she aimed to please. She and the waitstaff brought out everything on time. We were dining with 3 children and their food came out first. The children's menu offers a plethora of different menu items and sides for the children's prices at $6.85. My daughter ordered cheeseburger sliders which appeared edible.  The trouble occurred when we ordered the ""Avocado Eggrolls"". These were not good at all. What arrived to our table were 6 Tortillas wrapped in what the Manager described as ""cream cheese"", with sliced Avocado. No seasoning. None of the ingredients listed on the menu. No cilantro, no peppers. Just a slice of avocado in a cold tortilla. Correct me if I am wrong, that is NOT an egg roll. I asked the waitress if these could be substituted or taken off of our bill due to the disappointment. She summoned a manager who was an older Latino man who without a name tag and failed to introduce himself. He approached our table very frazzled and clearly bothered by our complaint. He asked what the issue was. I explained that the ""egg rolls"" were not good and that they do not fit the description of the appetizer listed on the menu.  Strike 1: He aggressively and in defense mode responded ""They are not good ? Or YOU do not like them ?!!"" I was seated with family, including children. I stared at him at this point. I repeated They are not good. None of the ingredients named on the menu are included on this item. (This is now your opportunity to recreate the menu item as it's described or give me my money back) STRIKE 2:  He proceeds to debate with me with a very condescending tone. ""You are mistaken. There is cream cheese...."" I see you ate half the order.  Let's do some math!  There are 6 terrible Eggrolls.  There are 5 people at the table. 3 people ate 1 Eggroll. Three are now 3 remaining.  I ate 1 sir. I wouldn't dare consume another.  Strike 3: He then in frustration removes the item and says he will remove it from the bill.  The first lesson in running any form of business is  1. The customer is always right !  Perhaps he needs a refresher course. How dare you debate me. How dare you argue with a customer while dining with family. The rest of the meal was terrible. I ordered a sirloin steak for $19.50. The meat was as tough as a leather belt. I was curious to try dessert but decided this establishment will not rob me of another penny or any of my family time. I witnessed another customer returning what appeared to be a very cold burger to the same manager. I witnessed him take care of that right away without a condescending tone.  If you want to enjoy dinner and drinks, Bronx BBQ is just across the parking lot. I know the manager there and he values his paying customers that have kept his business open for 10+ years. I don't foresee BJ's sticking around for too long if customers are treated so poorly and the dining experience is lackluster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream,3.36,2.83,2.83,2.8560000000000003,3.042

My friend originally ordered the pork chop but was told, they were all out.(This should've of been the first sign considering it was only 8:30pm and you can only order the pork chop after 4pm.) So my friend ordered the Crusted Parmesan chicken, which comes with mash potatoes and steamed broccoli. Five minutes later a runner comes to the table with the spinach/artichoke dip w/nachos. This wouldn't have been an issue except, his hand is holding the plate touching the nachos. This is first major no no. He apologizes and corrects the issue. Literally 5 minutes later another runner comes to the table with our entrees. He seems annoyed that our table doesn't have a pizza stand. He asked me where is it, I let him know that I have no idea, there wasn't one at my table to begin with, and my waitress Claudia didn't bring one when i ordered. Now I've been to restaurants in many places, but I've never received my appetizer and entree, before I received my beverages. Also all my food in under 10 minutes???? We know it's not made to order. The appetizer: now it's advertised as a dip it was HORRIBLE. It tasted like cream of spinach with sour cream.Claudia finally came with our drinks and a pizza stand, and apologized for the dip. The pizza was actually alright for being pre-made but not worth $20. My friend said the chicken tasted and looked like it had been under the heat lamp long before we arrived. The broccoli was raw, and for some odd reason the lemon wedge we asked for in the water was in the mashed potatoes. The only good thing about this place is actually the beer and drinks. The Deal breaker was when we asked for the check. Claudia took another 20 minutes to bring it only after we put our jackets on. I paid with my debit card and she only came with the restaurant copy. I had to ask for my copy. Now I've been to restaurants around the world and have NEVER had to ask for my copy of the receipt, especially when we spent almost $100. The staff here is under trained no one knows the menu,  managers are non existent, And you have to beware your card isn't scammed. In Green Acres Mall with so many options I don't see this place lasting too long with service so bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=60,3.08,2.85,2.85,,2.942

It's not inside the actual mall itself but within the shopping center zig zagging through the parking lots. I've had good experiences both times with the only ""con"" being the service is slower than most places even when not busy. Good/friendly service but just slow. It's a nice environment inside, very sports bar-ish, basically like a Miller's but with better food imo. It's probably the better food option out of all the other crap around Green Acres Mall.

168,Wesley M.,"Hollis, NY",7,34,53.0,3.0,2017-11-12,"When it comes to service there needs to be huge improvements made here. Upon walking in and informing the hostess of the party size there was nothing else communicated. No ""a table is being cleaned,"" ""it will be a x minute wait,"" nothing. After sitting, and waiting to be called we watched as others came in and were seated. Making sure we weren't ""forgotten"" I ask the hostess how long the wait would be to then find out the table we were waiting on to be cleaned (unknown to us) was still not cleaned. It was the manager who jumped in and cleaned the table. Much respect to that manager as well who took the time to greet each and every guest.  After finally be seated we order the avocado egg roll, cherry chipotle boneless wings and a nashville hot chicken sandwich. I really enjoyed the egg rolls and would be back just for that. Whatever the sauce is that's served with that dish is great! The wings portion was huge and the sauce was pretty good. There wasn't anything special I found about the sandwich. The chicken was however moist, juicy and not dry. There are a lot of menu options and it can seem overwhelming, but there's literally something for everybody. I have not ruled this place out, but the service needs to be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream,3.28,2.88,2.88,,3.04

I first went to this place in Bakersfield/Fresno, California and it was pretty awesome. The waiter here attended to our every need and the food was phenomenal! The ambiance reminded me of a better version of TGIF or Outback Steakhouse. Soup: Tortilla chicken (would not recommend: Salty and small portion for price) Appetizer: Meatballs: (would not recommend: tasty but a bit undercooked I might add) Dinner: Sante fe Salad & Chicken Finger Salad = BOMB (HIGHLY recommend!)

163,Lesly L.,"New York, NY",1404,90,583.0,3.0,2017-11-30,"Hey Yelp Family, Coming at you with another review. This one goes to: BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  Very new in Valley Stream, this establishment serves up as a pop in and stay for a while feel. I've only been here twice and don't intend on coming back until the customer service is under control.  One night after a tiring day, I just wanted something to eat and a beer. I knew about this opening for a couple of weeks so I decided to come and check it out. I walked in with my wife and waited to see a hostess and the stand. Wait...Wait...Wait some more and still nothing. At this point it has gone past 5 minutes and no one came to greet us. Much to my surprise, the hostess was in the back chatting and giggling with her workmates. How do I know? As I stood there and wait, I found it kind of odd that a large group of workers were just standing there socializing and it was a busy night. The hostess comes to seats us and before we sat down, we noticed that the table hasn't been turned down. Hostess quickly grabbed someone to clean it down for us. Thank you for that! Now we play the waiting game for our waitress. Busy night, I get that but still not good. They should have the hostess take our drink order or something to that fact. Just a thought... After a whopping 25 minutes, the waitress introduces herself and apologizes for the delay. Her excuse you ask? I thought one of the other people up-front were covering this table.. My response? Oh you mean the 7 people hanging at the hostess station? She laughs.... I cringe some more because my tummy is ready to get BUSY! She takes our drink order, and asked me what I wanted to eat. I told her her: the salmon on a bed of quinoa. She makes a joke as i return the laugh and she ""writes down the order"". At this point, she is checking up on us frequently to make sure we are ok. Cool! She comes in and checks some more.. and more... and more... No plate in her hand. I stopped her and asked what was the update on my food. Just as soon as she said that, my wife's dish comes out. Where is mine you ask? I asked the waitress the same thing and she then replies: Oh you were serious about the salmon on the bed of quinoa? Ever see in the cartoons where they get pissed off and smoke blows out the ear? Well... this slowly started to happen. I immediately asked for the manager. No more games! The manager quickly comes to my table and offers an apology and gives me a glass of wine on the house and comps our bill. If I could remember his name, I would definitely tag him. But I don't so Thank you manager! At this point, my wife is upset that I didn't get my food so she decided not to eat. Isn't she lovely? Isn't that loyalty? If you're looking for a last minute spot to go and kickback, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Who knows, maybe they've changed.... Well until next time yelp family: keep on yelp'n!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream,3.48,2.91,2.91,,3.138
15,Nicholas S.,"Peabody, MA",41,9,4.0,2.0,2017-12-03,"Went yesterday for a bite to eat with the family after shopping. The atmosphere is very nice and typical for BJ's. Dark and wide open high ceilings and big booths. Server was nice and came quickly for drink orders and apps. The grand cru beer was great, it's a Belgian ale style, high alcohol and a slight bitter taste similar to Duvel or Chimay. The water and sodas took a few minutes the beer a few more then another 15 minutes for sliders and guacamole with chips and no apology for the delay. Within 1 minute we were served our entrees. So now we had all our food on the table and for some reason our entree was cold. So we returned the entrees and left after the appetizers were done. Sever seemed oblivious to the error but took the food off the bill.  The sliders were ok but it was obvious they cut a full size burger that was cut in four. Seems like a cop out to not have a separate patty. The guacamole tasted good but it was clear from the color that it was not fresh, as it was turning brownish. It's a shame as I've been to a few BJ's in Texas and they were very good. I think I'll wait for my next trip to TX before trying them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20,3.4,2.88,2.88,,3.088

23,Tam S.,"Lynbrook, NY",0,22,,2.0,2017-12-23,"We were doing some last minute shopping in the area and were hungry so that is how we ended up here. Very unfortunately we ended up with Brie as our waitress and I say that because, the place was not busy, only a few tables were occupied and this is a pretty big place and It took Brie at least 10 minutes to first acknowledge us at our table, mind you we are all of two people. We placed our entire order, water, appetizers and entrees and I told the waitress I needed the water to take medication. After ordering I went to the bathroom and when I returned to the table a good 10 minutes later, no water at the table yet. I eventually got up and went to the bar and got a water. 20 minutes go by and still no waters. We noticed several employees together talking and looking at their cell phones, but Brie was no where to be found. Eventually I went to find the manager. He apologized about the water and brought us two waters even though I already went and got my own. Of course we only wanted lemon in one water which we were VERY SPECIFIC about to the manager, but he ignored the specifics because he did not really care as far as we were concerned. So FINALLY Brie appears out of nowhere and pretty much slams two waters down on our table, it was an ""In-your-face"" water delivery. She saw moments before that, that her manager had brought us waters. No apology for her neglect of the table whatsoever.  We ordered two appetizers: Beets/goat cheese and the brussell sprouts sirracha, both of those were amazing. We ordered the turkey burger with the portobello swisse burger dressings. I do not eat fries so I had a side of sauteed spinach, both were amazing. We also ordered the Hand-pulled Turkey Dip sandwich which also was delicious. Sad part about this place is that the service sucks, but the food was excellent. Management needs to have more control of the staff. Cell phones while on shift should NOT BE ALLOWED.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=40,3.28,2.89,2.89,,3.0460000000000003

No one drank their cocktails because it tasted horrible which was upsetting since we had to wait for one of the drinks because they ran out of glasses.

They have them all displayed, one may get flustered and have a hard time ordering one (me). However they have a some what helpful scale on their menu of beers from light to dark. That really helped me out.  Food: just like the drinks, there is literally everything on this menu. E v e r y t h I n g. Pizza, burgers, fries, steaks, sea food, pasta.. and more. I was so overwhelmed by eventually picked something different from my usual orders. That night they had a special on burgers that included unlimited fries, cool!

My bf and i were overwhelmed they are very overpriced. We wanted to get drinks but with the food prices were afraid of how much cocktails would be especially if they barely had alcohol in it. We started with cheese dip which was good I had to stop myself. I ordered the Santa  Fe salad and my bf ordered the quinoa bowl with shrimp his food was bland but its quinoa so duh?

161,Laren E.,"Rosedale, NY",83,47,384.0,1.0,2018-01-10,"So let me start by saying I live in the area and I love brew houses. I visit green acres mall often and decided to give this place a try. I was not pleased at all: Pros:  The staff are very friendly and upbeat, even the Manager. Upon arrival until departure all staff were very nice. The waiter( didn't get her name) was informative about the elaborate menu and offered her suggestions. The bathrooms were very clean. I love a clean bathroom. Its also has a modern look with a unique hand washing fixture.  The décor to the restaurant is very nice and its spacious. The bar setup is stunning and neat. Cons: The restaurant has a smell to it like someone used the same dirty was over and over again to clean the whole place. Also the menus need to be cleaned as the pages stuck together .  My waitress forgot my ENTIRE entrée, as in she took the liberty of suggesting what entrees were good, took down my order, and it never came out. Good thing I ordered an appetizer (will get into that in the next paragraph). When our check came I realized my order was never even on the check which means it was never even taken, which means the waitress must have been doodling on the portable device she was pretending to take my order with. My mother was so shocked but by that time I wasn't.When I received my appetizer I did not receive the pickles as advertised on the menu however the sausage was good . My nephew had mac and cheese which was kraft mac and cheese , and was advertised as such. I thought that maybe they would have brought it up to restaurant quality seeing how much it cost but I was sadly disappointed again and so was my nephew, and he LOVES mac and cheese, and he's 3. I ordered a flight of different beers being that I love beer . EVERY SINGLE BEER was TERRIBLE. My mother ordered a burger and she loved it. I had a small bite, seeing at the time that I was never going to get my entree, and it was actually delicious HOWEVER I will not be returning to this restaurant . I eat all over at green acres mall from Fridays, to Applebee's ,  and Bronx BBQ and I was very disappointed with this place and it was my first time. I just can't take another risk with the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream,3.28,2.97,2.97,,3.0940000000000003
