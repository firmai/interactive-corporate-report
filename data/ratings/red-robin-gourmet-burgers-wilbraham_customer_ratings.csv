38,Felicia K.,"West New York, NJ",73,346,17.0,3.0,2012-01-04,"It's a chain. Don't usually expect so much variation, but this place was definitely not as good as the one I usually visit in NJ. I guess the one major advantage of a chain is that you know what to expect, but then when you don't get what you expect it can be disappointing. The menu was quite different, and even though I ordered something I have ordered at the other location a number of times, the presentation/ingredients actually varied quite a bit. Service was good and it has a nice, cheery atmosphere and affordable prices. Great for kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham?start=20,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

26,Chris M.,"Springfield, MA",171,143,91.0,3.0,2012-05-18,"I like RR for the most part. The novelty of the place has worn off for my family though. We've eaten here and other locations numerous times. Every now and then you end up getting a server that is useless (there have been a few occasions where we had to remind the manager we were still there.) If you get a veteran server you should be all set. If someone in your party has a dietary or allergy concern be sure to spell it out clearly and have them repeat it back to you, no matter how busy they are. We have had a handful of goof ups that likely came from the kitchen but could have been averted by a waitress who was on the ball. Of course the practice of having 'anyone' available bring your food to you without being able to check it doesn't help. The Blue Ribbon burger is good as is the BBQ burger. We've also enjoyed the onion rings. Based on burger purity I prefer 5 Guys as a chain. But I bet there are some local (independent or family run) burger joints that you'd be happier with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham?start=20,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

30,Danielle M.,"Springfield, MA",9,34,4.0,2.0,2012-09-23,"We gave up meat recently, but prior to our dietary changes, we loved us some burgers!  Unfortunately, this location is very hit-or-miss with servers. We've had great servers once or twice, but we usually end up with a high school kid who doesn't care too much about their tip. It seems like they're often working there to hangout with their friends who also work there. That may seem a bit harsh, but I'm pretty sure we witnessed something like that when we went a few months ago. The burgers are usually pretty decent, but a little on the pricey side for what it is. The endless fries usually made up for it, though.  Ask your server to start you off with a basket of fries when you put your order in. You may find that the burger gets a little more mileage if you've had something prior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham?start=20,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

19,Joanna F.,"Stoneham, MA",215,725,,3.0,2013-01-21,"It is exactly as I thought it would be.  Having never been to a Red Robin, my husband and I decided to try it since it's down the street from my parents' house.  Decor is kind of a cheesy, 50s-ish diner feel and it's definitely super family oriented. Our waitress was really personable and nice once she actually showed up, but it took her about 10-15 minutes to greet us.  They have a pretty good beer list for a chain restaurant and a lot of wine and cocktails also.  I stuck with a Steel Rail while my husband went crazy and ordered a Guinness milkshake (ice cream, Guinness and whiskey).  The shake was ludicrously delicious (probably the best thing we had the entire time there). On to the food.  In an attempt to be healthy, I got the California Chicken sandwich without mayo or bacon.  I thought the guac on top would provide more than enough moisture and the provolone sounded delicious.  I also got steamed broccoli on the side.  The chicken ended up being very good but the guac was almost nonexistent and definitely not fresh (unsurprisingly) so my sandwich ended up being pretty dry.  The steamed broccoli was not covered in butter or oil, which I really liked. My husband got the ""Royal Red Robin"" (burger with cheese, bacon, and an egg over easy).  The egg was definitely over hard and not runny at all, which was kind of disappointing, but overall it seemed fine. One comment - I'm not really complaining, but I was kind of surprised by the portions.  They were reasonable, but I thought the side of fries with my husband's burger would be massive, but it was actually pretty small.  If you're STARVING, you may be a bit disappointed. Overall, I may come back, but I think I would rather go to Friendly's down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

The service could not be bothered to perform their duties as they were to busy gabbing at the registers discussing what ever. When the food finally arrived my fries were cold and mushed in a pile. It appeared to be a huge drama to get them replaced as waitrwss could not be bothered. When the nrw came back I was told that the fries were just made thanking the waitress for going above an beyond minimal standard I nit into my 3rd fry to find that it was still frozen inside! Every other red robin is awesome except this 1! The restroom appeared to used from the door no need to enter just squirt your business from there!

Red Robin with its clichéd wall art is at the lower end of burger joints and even restaurants. My only reason for eating here was a $25 gift card I had to use. Ordered the boneless buffalo wings for an appetizer. They were dry, hard, and overcooked. They lacked any of the sauce we asked for and were the worst we've ever had. The servers were stressed, confused, and short staffed. Leading to our burgers coming out while we were still eating our appetizer. The burgers were mediocre, and weren't even in the same league as a Luxe, Plan B or Max Burger. The beef patty was very thin and flavorless, and was not worth the $10-13 price tag they're charging. Sure the gimmicky bottomless fries and free refills are cool, but don't think for a second you're not paying for them in the high burger prices.

The tables were sticky and dirty. They advertise bottomless fries yet they are reluctant to actually give fries when ordered.  For 4 of us, they gave a small basket with enough fries for one small child,  our party consisted of all adults.  We asked for more fries and after waiting 25 minutes for our meals, our fries still hadn't arrived.  He asked if we still wanted them and we all said yes. He never brought any extra fries.  He didn't refill our drinks. The food was mediocre and not worth the price.  Next time we will go to one of the local pubs for much better burgers.   Our biggest complaint was the filthy tables, chairs and floors as well as the slow, odd service.  The following was my review from 2 years ago. This place has really gone down hill! 9/13/2014 Red Robin is good if you are just looking for a burger and fries.   Ashlee was our waitress today.  Because of her I gave 4 stars rather than 3.  She is one of the best waitresses we have ever had.  She is aways happy, helpful, and pleasant.  She seems to really like serving people.   Red Robin is lucky to have her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
