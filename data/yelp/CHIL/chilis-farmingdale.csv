David K.,"West Babylon, NY",51,219,103,3.0,12/26/2017,"I have been here several times over the years.  I'm pretty positive that I have reviewed this place too, but here we go. We came here for a quick bite and some drinks.  They are really pushing using the little table top kiosk machine to order and pay.  Trying to make it a thing.  The waiter came over and took our drink order. When he came back, I put in my food order.  I ordered the margarita grilled chicken.  It comes on bed of black beans and rice with some tortilla strips.  It was pretty good. Chili's fall into a range if you have ever been.  You will usually have an okay to good meal.  I think it is a good Chili's and the staff has always been friendly.  If you like that kind of place, definitely go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale
Eric P.,"Baldwin, NY",57,296,,2.0,10/6/2017,My wife and I went to Chili's for dinner yesterday. It had been quite a while since I went to a Chili's and after yesterday I know that was a correct decision. We were seated quickly and ordered a bowl of chili a side salad a chicken fajita and some dry rub ribs. The chili was burned and inedible and had to be returned. The salad was ok but not inspired. The chicken fajita was very pedestrian and the sides were rather small.The ribs were not great but were acceptable.Even with the 50% off coupon the food was rather poor.Service was very good and was responsive.The price to value ratio is around average for this type of restaurant. All in all this was a poor experience and I will not be returning in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale
Susan Y.,"Medford, NY",77,202,2,4.0,9/18/2017,"I recently came here to meet up with some friends in the afternoon on Labor day.    We were seated right away.  It was a holiday afternoon, but not crowded at all.  They had a drink special, buy one get one free, and you were given the drinks at the same time.   There was enough on the menu to please anyone's taste.   That had smaller portions for lunch, which was nice to see.  We spent the better part of the afternoon here just talking and did not feel rushed at all. .   Wait service was attentive and the food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale

Natasha T.,"Massapequa, NY",10,7,4,3.0,10/3/2017,"I enjoy Chili's. I have lunch there at least 3 times a month. The food is affordable and  better quality than fast food. Some of my favorites from the menu are the buffalo chicken salad, tex mex bowls and molten lava cake....all great choices. I mostly get my food to go and the process needs a little bit of streamlining.

Judy E.,"West Babylon, NY",6,58,30,4.0,1/23/2017,"Went last week for their 3 courses for $10 deal.   I was not disappointed.   The website did not provide accurate information, and so I had to call and make sure what the deal was.   The three in my party all got fajitas, so that is all I can comment on. The salad was small, but fresh.  The fajitas were served hot  and sizzling with sides of tortillas, salsa, sour cream and tomatoes.  Lettuce was missing ?   We took the dessert home (molten lava cake), and although I enjoyed it the next day I am sure it would have been heavenly right out of the oven.  The deal was great for the price and it was the perfect amount of food for a light dinner    The convenient way to pay with the table side computer was quick, and kept my credit card within sight at all times    A definite plus!   Service was good with a two server team approach",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale
Tayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",139,98,272,5.0,4/19/2016,"I always visit this Chili's when its on my mind whenever I'm in the area. There's never too long of a wait to eat in or take out. We only sit in the bar section with the 7-8 TVs and theres usually different games/stations occupying each one. The whole kiosk system makes things great for checkout - swipe and go and the receipt is printed right at the table. We usually have coupons for free something whether it be desert or apps and the employees never give us a hard time with taking it to-go (most coupons are dine-in only). Drinks are good, food arrives in a timely manner and I have no memorable complaints from any of our visits! The Chili's app has a ""wait in line"" feature so check that out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale
Mike T.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,7,,3.0,12/3/2017,"I used to think Chili's was one of the best options out of the ""casual dining"" choices, but my last visit was mediocre at best.  Upon entering to put my name on the wait list, there was a hostess who looked completely disinterested in helping anyone and just seemed to be leaning over the wait list area.  I had to basically get her attention to add my name on the waitlist, it was busy and we were told about 30-45 minutes.  The quoted time turned out to be correct which was expected and fine. I will say service was solid, server was friendly and timing on food and drinks was good which is the reason I didn't rate lower.  The real disappointment is with the food, in the past I always felt the fajitas were a good option here and it doesn't seem that way any longer.  I felt the chicken was sort of rubbery, and the steak and shrimp was overly seasoned to the point where it was difficult to really enjoy it.  Every now and then it seems like a good idea to bring the family to a place like this, and then I guess I tend to regret it.  I understand Chili's is a chain and I know not to expect really high quality food, but the overall experience seems to have become ""eh, it's ok"".  I probably will return because of the kid-friendly atmosphere and I like them better then Applebee's, maybe I'll try something else next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale

The appetizers were all fried.  I was looking for greener pastures.  But you can't win them all? Or can you?  I told the server that I was disappointed and she told me that she would take note.  I felt like I made a difference.  The place was clean and to be frank, our server was good.  Not hibachi restaurant good, but very professional.

Diana Q.,"Babylon, NY",355,785,1396,3.0,1/26/2016,"Visit Date: January 10, 2016  Came here with my hubby for our monthiversary dinner. We only came here because my mom gave us gift cards for our wedding anniversary and we wanted to use them.  It was alright I'm never one to be really impressed with chain restaurants, I'm more of a mom and pop independent restaurant lover so chain establishments do not excite me or wow me.  The prices are reasonable. I think we got our dinners 2 for $20.  I had the vegetable fajitas, hubby had the steak fajitas. Mine came with lots of veggies, some beans, some rice, usual Mexican fix ins of cheese, guac & sour cream. Hubby had to order beans & rice on the side because the meat fajitas don't come with them. Everything tasted decent, wouldn't say it was out of this world, but definitely not terrible either.  I felt they could have given us more tortillas, it seemed they gave us a small amount to share. We could have asked for more but we were okay with the 3 between us, at least I was. Still it would have been nice to have a little more in the tortilla pot.  So overall if you want a decent place that's nothing special this chili's will do for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale

It literally took 20-25 mins to get our food. It was just nachos and a salad. People who had arrived after us with a different waitress had been eating already.

What is that? How can you be out of all of those beers on a Saturday afternoon? Something is seriously wrong!

Regina M.,"Syosset, NY",0,5,,2.0,1/4/2015,"Went into the Farmingdale Chili's with my mom for lunch on December 26, 2014.  We were shopping in the area and decided to use the gift card I had received on Christmas.  What a mistake!    We walk in and they wanted to seat the two of us at a table for 6 by the window.  We said we would preferred a smaller table and saw many empty ones... Problem was they were all dirty.  I said we would wait.   We then sat at a small table and waited for the server.  He was timely but looked like he just ran a marathon and/or crawl out of kitchen after fixing equipment or something.  He was wearing a tee shirt that look like he slept in it.  He had on dirty jeans and was sweating all over his face.  All the servers actually looked like they needed a scrubbing wearing a  messy uniform.     We reluctantly ordered our food knowing he was unlikely cooking the food.  I ate half my salad when I found hair in it.  I did take a picture not knowing what to do with this.   The server was pleasant but I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I asked for the bill and he said I had to use the kiosk at the table.  What a PIA... never again will I go back there.  I prefer to be served my bill.  The whole experience was disgusting and disappointing.  What a turn-off! I paid the bill and even left a tip because the color of the hair was not the hair color of the server.  I am not naming names nor am I looking for anything free... just thought you should know.   I had been to the Bethpage location in the past with no issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=40
Joseph F.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",10,27,21,3.0,6/4/2012,"While not typically a fan of large, national restaurant chains, I was somewhat impressed by my outing to Chili's for a family member's birthday. Since we were a large group (about 12-13 people), it took a moment to have us seated, but not very long (5-7 mins). Waiter was friendly and attentive (and kept the nachos coming).  Flipping though the menu, you have your chain staples. Burgers, wings, salads, and combos. Playing it safe, I went with the Shiner Bock BBQ Burger, and was surprised. The burger was juicy and flavorful (and gone a few moments after it was placed in front of me). Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well, some where even pleasantly surprised.  Only negatives were things you'd find in any national chain. There were several other guests there for birthdays as well (apparently), so the sound of staff singing and clapping was almost constant and somewhat annoying (we did feel bad that the staff had to do something so corporately cliche and unoriginal, as a cute sing-song ""dance monkey, dance!"" kind of moment). Also don't know how good everything is on a consistent basis, we could have been there on a ""good"" night.  All in all, food was good, service was good, and we left satisfied.

Shira F.,"Massapequa, NY",388,384,1085,2.0,6/21/2012,"If I ever choose to eat at a chain restaurant, Chili's is the one I go to. Greasy goodness. I popped in today because I had a free appetizer, and went with the southwest egg rolls, which were really good. Then my sister and I shared a triple dipper, 3 smaller apps, and those were good. We also got twofer pomegranate margaritas which hit the spot on this sweltering day. This is where things went horribly wrong. I order the same exact entree every time I come to Chili's, the crispy chicken tacos with fries. After all the appetizers today, my sister and I decided to just split one and take the rest home. So, I bit into the taco and the chicken was ice cold. I was completely turned off after that, I politely discarded the food into my napkin and sent it back.

Alex C.,"Plainview, NY",2,10,7,2.0,3/19/2015,I have been going to Chili's for several years. This last experience was very disappointing.  Lately I find there portions to be getting smaller and quality going down.  When we first arrived we were greeted by a young hostess.  We requested a booster and he hands me a seat covered in sticky syrup!  Really would you sit in this.   The plates they brought for the appetizer were dirty.   We get chips and guacamole which was good but a slightly over salted.   We ordered a chicken dish that was tasty but had quite a bit of fat on it.  We also ordered a quesadilla which was above average.  The kids mac and cheese was dried out and gross.  The kids pizza was just blah.  The waitress was hard to find especially when we needed napkins and drink refills.  Which was odd seeing the place was dead!   The manager came over when everything was over.  I told him all my concerns.  You would think if they cared they would check on the table during the beginning of the meal.  Totally going down hill and would not waste my time there again!  If this place stays like this the customers will not return!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=40

The server was pleasant but spoke so fast that I had to ask her to repeat what she said frequently. Regarding the food, the salsa was very watery tomato juice with a bit of hot sauce. The chips were paper thin with almost no taste. My lunch salad consisted of pineapple wedges which were a bit past their prime and browning, canned mandarin orange wedges, wilting greens and a dressing which also was without taste. All of it was drowned in way too much water. Should I have expected better? I guess not. I'll stick to the family owned restaurants as I always have.

David Y.,"Farmingdale, NY",1,37,,5.0,6/16/2016,Best food and best service. I eat there atleast once a week . They have a very good and friendly staff. They also have a very good manager. I love their chicken and beef fajitas. They are the best place to drink beer. They have a good varieties of alcohol drink . I usually sit in the bar. The bartenders are very friendly and they care a lot  about their patrons. The place is very clean and the food is always fresh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20

Cassie G.,"Farmingdale, NY",185,16,5,3.0,2/16/2016,Only getting 3 stars for the food. Service sucked first time ive had a problem with a waitress (name danielle) Not very personable or friendly. Dropped the food and left.came over took drink orders app orders then brought them got food order and left. Didnt check on us at all. When she gave us he food barely moved anything on the table to clear room..left it for us. I got unsweetened iced tea with lemon and the lemon was definitely not a lemon...smelt like a fruit i could not identify. Made the drink taste gross.. Not a great service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
Kori A.,"Deer Park, NY",9,141,15,2.0,3/3/2016,Here now. Wish I had a napkin to wipe my hands and I wish my waiter refilled my drinks & you know stopped by. This chilis is the worst I've been to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
T H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,120,,3.0,6/11/2016,"Went here on the limb it was my first time. The food wad pretty good. I ordered the margarita chicken, loaded potatoes and corn. The chicken was good moist, mashed potatoes was good but salty, the corn was good but also a little on the salty side. I would definitely try this spot again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
Kate K.,"Huntington, NY",24,17,,1.0,9/9/2015,"Service was terrible, asked for drinks and had to remind server to bring them. Ordered an appetizer (chips and salsa) and hadn't received it after about 20 minutes....our server brought out entrees instead. When I asked her to make sure that the appetizer was removed from our bill she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Biggest problem was that the staff was having their NFL draft party in the restaurant at this time. They closed off one area of seating so that they could have their party....ALL the staff was in and out of this area while they were working! No wonder the service was so terrible, they were too busy worrying about draft picks! The best part was while we were still eating dinner, our server came over and told us that we could pay whenever using the app on the table...she just couldn't wait to get rid of us! I will never return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
Jennifer R.,"CORONA, NY",3,16,43,4.0,12/19/2014,Good food. The menu is overwhelming.  They should have better meal options for the 2 for $20. But I've had good experiences the few times I've been here. Overall not bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
Steve J.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",1,27,4,3.0,5/6/2014,"Food was ok but I'm a bit confused about this new tablet/kiosk devise at each table. It seems that you can order food, drinks, and pay your check at the table without ever interacting with the waitress. The bartender delivered the drinks and the kitchen expediter brought the food. I only met the waitress once when asked if everything was ok. Not a terrible concept but the tablet is preset to add a 20% tip for the waitress. It's adjustable but where do they get the nerve to suggest that is a standard when the waitress neither greeted you, took your order, brought your food or accepted payment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
Natural J.,"Amityville, NY",26,42,53,3.0,7/23/2015,"Sooo this Chilis really use to be my spot, j recently met up with a friend here and now I remember why I really don't come here as much anymore. The service has really changed, the waitress acted like she really didn't want to be bothered, like she'd rather be somewhere else than serving us. I looked passed that, everybody has a bad day. I ordered the spicy tacos, which are my fav, but I must admit I've been hesitate to order anymore because it's like it's just thrown together, either missing something or just the presentation doesn't look good. My taco was missing the sauce, had to wave our ""happy"" waitress down to get more sauce. So the tacos were just okay, I've had better but they did the job. My friend ordered the white spinach queso dip which was soooooo good! I was excited because there other queso is good but since I don't eat meat anymore i can't eat it but this new one was on point. I'd go back just to get that. Me and my friend closed the restaurant out and I can tell our waitress was annoyed because she now wanted to keep walking past our table giving us the nice side eye, but our bill was already paid, and let me say I do love that you can pay on the table now, it's so much better than waiting forever for the waiter/waitress to bring the bill etc. Overall my experience was just okay, it's a franchise, so that's usually what you get, but I might swing back to get that queso. Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
Rebecca J.,"Bethpage, NY",39,2,,4.0,2/8/2016,"Fantastic fajitas, Savory Spicy nachos, 2 for 1 flavorful margaritas - What more could you ask for? I love going to Chili's with my friends because we are always given great service, great food at reasonable menu prices and have more than our share of drinks. Frozen Strawberry margaritas are my absolute favorite! If you've never tired Chili's before, I highly recommend that you do very soon. The new smothered chicken burritos are awesome, I highly suggest you try them. Can't wait to go back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=20
