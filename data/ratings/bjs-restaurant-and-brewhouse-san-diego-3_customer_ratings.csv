136,Drew A.,"San Diego, CA",133,8,,5.0,2016-09-29,Went to the soft opening yesterday and the layout there is awesome! Great date spot or place to catch a happy hour and/or sporting event.

121,Mia H.,"San Diego, CA",158,4,4.0,5.0,2016-10-02,"Bj's restaurant, new location on villa la Jolla, soft opening day. Oct 1 2016 Pros: friendly atmosphere, modern spacious design, awesome full stocked bar, family friendly, delicious food. Gorgeous open patio. Cons: the location is still around a few construction due to remodeling so parking might be a hassle, but it will done soon. On October 1st, I stopped by BJs on the corner of Villa La jolla for a bite to eat and drinks. It was around 5:30pm,  my flatmates and I live down the street and used to come by to dine with the previous location. When we walked in, the staff apologized for the commotion due to the soft opening and training thier new hires. So, the meals were free but alcohol was charged. What a deal am I right ;). All proceeds went to    a charity, I think it was cystic fibrosis.  We grabbed 3 spots at the bar, chairs were nice and comfortable living, atmosphere was awesome and had a nice relaxing escape with the extended patio. Our bartender was Alyssa, she was an awesome delight. She was patient with our orders, recommended lots of entrees, gave us options on what drinks she can make based on our tastes. We started off with thier homemade oktoberfest, watermelon mojito, and a pink Cadillac. The watermelon mojito was a custom, which I appreciated Alyssa doing. The pink Cadillac was an ultimate martini I definitely recommend, it's my favorite. As an appetizer, we started out with the Flatbread nachos. These were addictive and divine. We couldn't get enough. For entrees we ordered chicken soba noodles with peanut sauce, chicken club sandwich, and a chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. Alyssa was kind enough to grab us plates in order for us to sample each other's plates. Honestly, everything was delicious I would definitely order the chicken Soba noodles and chicken spinach quinoa bowl again. Chicken club if I felt like  lunch.    The prices are reasonably priced. Overall, I loved my experience at BJ'S, my flatmates and I enjoyed this place so much we have agreed we will return every weekend as our hangout (how I met your mother status).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=120,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572
105,Vince H.,"San Diego, CA",430,10,5.0,5.0,2016-10-02,"Attended the soft opening and was seated at the bar. The new open air environment, especially here in La Jolla, was the perfect ambient for a fun and social dinner. Since the weather is great almost all year round, making the decision to be an open air restaurant was a smart move. Definitely recommend coming out here on sport nights to grab a few drinks and bites. I had the pleasure of being served by the bartender, Alyssa. She had such a great personality that definitely brightened up and went hand in hand with the new layout. She served us our drinks fast, gave us great recommendations, and always made sure we were pleased. She will definitely be my go to person to be served by. Needless to say, I will be coming back here every weekend for some destressing from the work week and enjoying the fresh air, great sports on tv, and fantastic drinks. P.S. The house brew Oktoberfest and BJ's Royal Soda are my recommended drinks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=100,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.5400000000000005

I love that you can order, pay, etc. from the mobile app. Shout out to BJ's for being ahead of the curve from a technology perspective! Overall this is a great addition to our neighborhood.   I had to remove one star- One big negative for us is that the patio is not dog friendly. There are plenty of great local places in the area that welcome dogs on the patio (Urban Plates!), so unfortunately we won't be spending as much time here as we would have liked. This causes the vibe to feel more commercial and reminds us as locals that this is a chain restaurant. I hope they will consider allowing dogs on the patio at this location once they move past opening week!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=100,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.376000000000001

49,Jinyoung C.,"Carlsbad, CA",465,224,103.0,3.0,2016-10-10,"I went to the second night of their re-opening. The patio is very very cold, and I can't imagine how cold it'll get during the winter time. They had way too many waiters and waitresses; even given that it was second night of re-opening. When I was seated, I asked for the happy hour menu. One waitress told me that there is no happy hour, but when a more experienced looking waitress came by, she said that happy hour is only available in the bar area. I went to the bar area, and I was just sitting around for 10-15 minutes before I had to grab some waitress, who was crowded near the entrance along with the other waiters and waitresses. Service was quick, but getting the attention wasn't. My cloth napkin was dirty; it had some weird sticky things on it.

Went there the past weekend - just one week after their opening :) The location is great - heart of UTC and the ambiance is so much better than any of the BJs I have been too. Recently i had stopped going to BJs because the food was not great anymore -- but looking at the place i decided to give it a try - and glad I did. They have ample inside, outside and at the bar. We choose to sit at the patio -it was nice - tables for large groups as well as small with pretty lights. The selection of beer and drinks were great - we opted for beer - I have always loved their lightswitch. They also had beers from local brewery like green flash - but they were out that day !  They have significantly improved their food menu with good vegetarian options. We ordered the flat bread nachos for appetizers and they were really yummy. We ordered their thin crust pizza and it was good - a good change sometimes from the fast-flash thin crust pizzas. I love that they now have mini pizookies. Perfect portion for one person. I got the ghirardelli chocolate one - and it was divine ! They have lot of servers - since the place is new and they are training the staff so might feel a  little uncomfortable - but for us it was not too bad. Plus they will return to normal numbers after the training is done. I love that they are open till late - perfect place to hangout on weeknights as well.

145,J J.,"San Diego, CA",4,45,8.0,1.0,2016-10-12,"Nope! We went a few nights ago to give it a try, and really wish we didn't.  They don't have reservations, but something called the ""call ahead list"".. which ended up being the same wait (30 mins) as the people who just showed up at the door. Minus points. The service: was unbelievably uncomfortable. Felt like there were more people working than guests. All the waiters/waitresses were trying SO hard, it made us feel super uncomfortable. We heard one waiter literally repeat the exact same words, in the exact same fake happy tone, to about 5 tables.. felt like we were stuck in some creepy matrix. We don't like forced kindness forced upon us. Minus points. The food: We got the dry sriracha rub boneless chicken, and a flatbread (can't even remember which one), and a kale salad. The boneless chicken was a lot of batter, very little meat. The flatbread was obviously not memorable. Salad was gone in 2 mins cause it was tiny. But, the worst part was after leaving the location. I don't know WHAT they put in the food, and we both had indigestion issues that lasted 2 days. So beware if you have a sensitive stomach or are not used to eating fried foods, and a shit ton of oil. Super minus points!!! The menu: all over the place. No wonder why the food wasn't good. It's like a glorified Chili's. The only good thing about here is they have a pretty decent selection of beers, and a lot of TV's, so probably good for drinking + sports. But as a culinary location... no.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=140,3.236,3.236,3.236,3.236,3.2360000000000007

The staff are definitely still getting up to speed, my table was forgotten and 2 orders were taken incorrectly but the staff were very accommodating and friendly so I don't believe it worth docking a star. (I got a free pizza from the mistake too!) The Hop Pact IPA (collab with Green Flash) is worth a try, though they are currently out (10/08/16). I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls.

112,Amy S.,"San Diego, CA",25,57,11.0,5.0,2016-10-16,"Yeah, I'm reviewing BJ's. I am finding it ridiculously difficult to find outstanding service at restaurants in San Diego, and Juan at the newly-reopened BJ's in La Jolla was outstanding. He was extremely attentive and had a great smile while he served us.  I mean, he actually seemed like he enjoyed his job. This is rare! The other staff was amazing as well. There was a server delivering drinks who was just as attentive as Juan. At least two or three others came by to check on us. Again, I have not had service like this very often in San Diego.  Their pizza doesn't ever disappoint. I had the tomato basil, and it has that wonderful, salty, buttery rich flavor you crave in a pizza. My husband had a very nice-looking seared tuna salad that he polished off. He also destroyed the calamari. He ordered the salted caramel pizookie on Juan's recommendation, and it was so amazingly decadent.  They have a great indoor/outdoor bar area. They offer tasters on their beers, and they made a very nice dirty martini for me. Well done for a satisfying Friday night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=100,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.6040000000000005

We came when it was just three weeks new so it is definitely understandable that the staff were still getting the hang out it.  Location is great. Replaced the old TGI Fridays and is across from the old BJ's (now new Nordstroms Rack). The restaurant is smaller but nice and clean. Reminds me of the one in North County. Parking can be a bit cumbersome during busy business hours.  Upon arrival, the hostess told us that we would be seated in a few minutes. However, she did not ask us if we wanted to sit inside or outside...she just put us outside. The waiters that came to our table were very ""fresh"". I don't remember his name but he stumbled a lot on his words and seemed very confused. Another one had brought our food and he just stuck both in the middle and did not say a word. Again, it's still new so understandable that they needed to get the hang of things.  We went with our usual meat lovers pizza and the crispy chicken salad. Both still very good at this location.

So, my advice to anyone ordering wings is get them ""naked"" and ask for ""extra crispy"".  I'd suggest that the restaurant manager take a closer look at their process to better render off some of the fat.  Buffalo Wild wings and Dirty Birds do a very good job at it and these days you gotta get your wing game to an A.

I didn't catch her name, but I wish I had to give her props for her service. She immediately took note of my 3 year old and offered us one of the huge booths, knowing that toddlers never sit still. It was so refreshing to have someone take the time to acknowledge that toddlers are not easy to dine with, and try to make it as comfortable as possible for this warn out momma. I don't know her name, but I do know that she was the blonde working on 11/18 around 3pm.  The next thing that really stood out to me was the toddler starter they sent out complimentary. It was a roll and a few pieces of fruit. Seriously, how stinking awesome to feel like my child was welcome, not like we were stuffed in the corner hidden from bothering other guests as we are so often.  The third thing that made this visit special was our server, Sean. He was just so on point. He was prompt attentive and so polite. Honestly probably one of the best servers I have ever had. He knew exactly when to come back and check on us, he was always keeping an eye out to see if we needed anything else, and took the time to make awesome beer suggestions.  I have been in BJ's restaurants many times, but this by far was the best experience I have ever had. The food was awesome, the service was awesome, and the location is so convenient.

They finally sat us and about 10 minutes after we orders it started raining and we were seated outside so we asked the manager if he could move us under the patio where there where empty tables and he said no because they have a reservation coming in 30 minutes. So he rearranged us at the edge of the patio that leaked with the rain and has no side covers!!!This manger was more worried about the customers that where not even here yet than us! Never ever will I go back. Besides the horrible customer service we received from the manager it is the smallest I have ever been to! Very disappointed because we eat at BJ's very often.

129,Kaylynn E.,"San Diego, CA",71,1,,1.0,2016-12-02,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Let me start by saying that I don't think it was entirely our waiters fault. I believe it was the staff and the kitchen who caused us to have an absolutely terrible night. A group of 10 of us arrived at around 8:15pm for a friend's birthday. They said that they don't make reservations and could not accommodate all of us so we had to sit down outside (it was about 53F). We ordered drinks which took a good 20 minutes to get to the table. We then all ordered appetizers which came out without a hitch and then we ordered our entrées. We did not receive our food until 10pm! We kept asking about the food and our waiter said that it would be out shortly and he would keep checking. By 10:15 only 4 people had received their food, two of which were ice cold. Two people had ordered soup(which tasted like it came from a can) and a different blonde waitress came out with the wrong ones. We kindly told her there had been a mix up and she gave us complete attitude. Another ordered a hot chocolate because it was so flipping cold outside and half of the hot chocolate was on the saucer and spilled down the side of the mug. The birthday girl's sandwich came out first. Then her soup and birthday dessert came out at the same exact time after her sandwich. It was so frustrating. The food I personally recieved was decent but honestly I could have made it better at home. We asked to speak to a manager and it took him a good 20 minutes untill he could spare the time to talk to us. He gave us a discount on our meal but it does not make up for ruining my friend's birthday. I will 100% never come back here again. If you want BJ's, go down to the one in San Diego off the 8 freeway because this one is an absolute shit show.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=120,3.88,3.88,3.88,2.9480000000000004,3.88

Read the fine print: Happy hour (10 PM to close) is ONLY at the bar. *facepalm* we were kind of excited about some of the Happy Hour deals such as half off the mini dish and $1 off drinks. The mini deep dish is tiny (like the size of a large woman's hand) and we were kind of astounded that it costed $11+ depending on the type. But thankfully the manager that night gave us the discount after we asked for clarification!  They take reservations so when we walked in, the table was already set up and ready for us. The service was a tad slow but I don't blame them, it's 10 PM (we stayed until almost close) and I'm sure the workers were super tired.  Honestly, The food was like a 7.5/10 due to personal preference but gave BJs 4 stars for pretty good service and decent food.  WHAT I ORDERED. - BBQ Bison Burger: served with Coleslaw. Nothing extraordinary about it. I liked the BBQ with the grassy bison meat. The burger was cooked really well, with some pinkness in the middle, just how I like it.  - Pizzokie Trio: I split this with two other girls and got the salted caramel Pizzokie. Not a fan of this. It was too salty and too sweet at the same time and I swear I bit into a salt pocket while eating this. However, every thing else was so freaking sweet it kind of counteracted the saltiness but I'd rather not go through that haha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=20,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.3760000000000003,3.84

I mostly want to warn people away from their BJ's App.  The Android app for loyalty-club and such.  It claims to ""put you on the waitlist' when it does nothing of the sort! The hostess (any of them) at this BJ's has never heard of the app, and apparently never sees the ""waitlist"" that the app uses.  So, you'll be waiting there on the bench for a really long time, even though the app confidently ""confirms"" that you're waiting to be seated. You have to sign in at the front desk to get on the waitlist.  The whole app is buggy anyway, so you're not missing anything.  After trying it three times, it was time to send it to the big Uninstall bin in the sky. On the rest of it, I do appreciate the menu printing calorie counts without secrecy for Every dish.  Some are surprising, in both directions.  The beers are excellent, always.. very predictable/repeatable, so if you find something you like, it won't change on you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.184,3.8

Instead of fixing it oh I can bring some on the side I didn't hear you say you wanted them. Ummm yes you did cause you said sure. Then I asked for napkins instead was given a cloth with utensils umm I didn't ask for that cause I already have it. Wait there is still more my friend asked for water first of all you should give water to start off anyways unless one says no so I asked for a water also but did I get it? No my friend got hers and I had to ask for it again kind you I had ordered another drink and had to wait for that for 30 mins still no water then she finally came with my drink but no water so I ask again can I please have water yes I'm annoyed now finally I get water but the waitress slams it on the table and leaves with an attitude. All I can say is I'm not having that and she needs to go back and learn how to serve and keep a cool admit when you make a mistake and apologize. I won't come here again. Nor recommend it.

146,Abbe A.,"San Diego, CA",13,69,,1.0,2017-03-26,"I stopped here mid afternoon yesterday (Saturday) with my 2 preschoolers because they enjoy the North County mall location and we were all hungry after an adventure at La Jolla Cove. We were quickly seated and greeted by a server and her trainee. We ordered drinks and I asked for a large cheese pizza while we decided what else we wanted. Things seemed to be going well, except they didn't! After a long while (approximately 20 minutes) the server and her trainee returned and I asked about the status of the pizza and ordered a salad. They said they would check on the pizza. The salad came out and we ate it. The problem seemed to be that even though they had only a few tables and there were 2 servers, they didn't have a good sense of what was going on and didn't do a good job of checking back frequently. I think it was this point- about 35 minutes in, that I realized something was really messed up. Eventually a ""kids pizza"" was delivered with the promise of another one coming. I told them that I had ordered a large pizza and not a kids size. At this point the manager came over and we started getting somewhere with the promise of a pizza in about 12 minutes. It was at this point that I considered bailing as my kids were climbing and being kids. They were hungry, heck, I was hungry. They know the drill, they sit down and color and a pizza comes out...but not here. After much time (over 1 hour)- a pizza was brought out. We ate, the servers were not easily found to get our check and a to go box. My concern is that the person training the new server was subpar. She had really poor customer service, wasn't attentive, just didn't seem to care. The manager comped our pizza and I paid for our lemonades and salad. I have never not left a tip even when the service is slow or not great. I was a server for 2 summers during college. I appreciate great service.

It was so fresh and tasty and everything worked together! My husband got salmon tacos on pita, also a win. Our drinks were slow to come, and I had to wave down a food runner to ask for them. There was a kids menu and the kids approved of the free fruit salad and garlic knot.  We also order a most delicious appetizer of fried calamari. Had to stop myself from scarfing the entire thing down. Love crispy fresh calamari.  The second night was a little more subduded. It was our last night in San Diego so I wanted more fish tacos. I order their grilled shrimp and one halibut tacos. It wasn't my favorite tacos on the trip but still pretty good. I also ordered their in house IPA. Weirdly, the beer had no taste.

Our second waiter made sure we weren't belligerent and had water before taking our next drink order and there was no warning that our single party was being too loud for the area that we were in.

I ordered the calamari appetizer and Asian chopped salad for lunch. I asked for no bell peppers on my salad and was happy they actually did that.  Sometimes places hear you and don't come through with your request.  Overall, my salad was delicious and the calamari was crispy and a great portion size for an appetizer.  I can't wait to come back here again for a sit down meal and try other items on the menu. Also, my order was ready at the time I specified.  That's always a plus in my book especially when you have only so much time to grab lunch.

9,Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",515,1213,8810.0,4.0,2017-06-06,"Friends have been wanting to try out BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse so we finally had a chance to visit (twice) in the last week. BJ's Restaurant is located in La Jolla Village. The brand new building was built from ground up. They took over the previous location that housed TGIF (does anyone else remember eating there when they were younger). I actually visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse a few months ago and sat at the bar. I thought the food was mediocre and found the restaurant to be cramped. Fortunately, the last two visits have been better. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse offers lunch specials Mon-Fri so I took advantage of that on our first visit. They have an unlimited salad and soup combo for only $8.95. Ashley, our server, was the funniest girl. She was incredibly helpful and kind. We ordered: UNLIMITED SOUP & SALAD: - I tried the clam chowder, chili, chicken tortilla, and broccoli cheddar. One word to describe all soups : LUKEWARM. All these soups would have benefited from being served hot.  - mozzarella & tomato salad: AMAZING. Straight up fresh and yummy. The small spheres of cheese were plentiful. The parm cheese and fresh parsley brightened this side salad to another degree. I am in love with this dish. ROOT BEER GLAZED RIBS: - BJ's Restaurant currently has a promotion. Spend $9.95 on any entree and you get a free appetizer on the house. Friend's entree was over $9.95 so we opted for the root beer glazed ribs. The ribs weren't very meaty and tasted dry. The sauce wasn't too sweet but it also didn't taste much of root beer. ENLIGHTENED MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN PITA TACOS: - I was surprised when the tacos came out served on toasted pita bread. I immensely enjoyed the flavors of these Mediterranean inspired tacos. The bite size pieces of chicken were tender. The red wine vinaigrette tasted tart and refreshing. The feta cheese paired well well the tomatoes and red onions. The pita bread was perfectly toasted and was warm & soft. The chicken was a bit scarce though. CHOCOLATE CHUNK PIZOOKIE: - download their mobile app and get this pizookie for FREE!! The chocolate chip cookie was baked fresh to order. It was thin, crispy, yet creamy with the molten chocolate chips. I liked the thinner cookie.  ...2nd visit... AVOCADO EGG ROLLS: - I was hoping the avocado egg rolls would rival the version I adore at Cheesecake Factory. It didn't. I was worried the cream cheese would be off putting but you could only taste a bit of it. The egg roll wrapper was nicely crispy. There was a decent amount of avocado but that was about it. NEW ORLEANS JAMBALAYA: - friend requested pasta instead of rice pilaf for his jambalaya. It was hearty dish. ENLIGHTENED MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN PITA TACOS: - I ordered the same pita tacos as friend from the last visit. BUT, our nice server let me sub out the bistro grains for, yes, you guessed it - the mozzarella and tomato salad. Still so wonderfully amazing. Please don't ever get rid of it. You get two pita tacos with the order so it's not a big portion. I wish they could add more chicken but it's satisfactory for the $10.75 price tag. My blog has more detailed review and pics Service was fine second visit. But Ashley, from our first visit, was fab.  Don't forget to have your receipt added to your app in order to earn points. I forgot both visits so had to input the information myself (good thing mom always taught me to save receipts). The menu here at BJ's Restaurant is huge so I would come back to try out more items (or lunch specials). I hope they continue to offer the mozzarella and tomato salad as it appears to be new. Overall, aside from lukewarm soups, the visits here have been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3,3.76,3.71,3.71,3.248,3.73
27,Bill V.,"San Diego, CA",36,380,415.0,4.0,2017-06-12,"As you would expect if you know this national chain of craft beer brewpubs, this is a nice room, though it is considerably smaller than other BJ's locations I have visited. Staff were good but very busy: The place was packed, with a 30 minute wait for a table on a Friday around 6pm. They have that great system where they text you when your table is ready, so I ran over to Nordstrom Rack while I was waiting to see if I could find a new shirt. Once we got seated, the food came out pretty quickly given home busy they were, and it was tasty. I particularly like the Italian Market pizza. And of course you have to get the pizookie for dessert (which is best described as a deep-dish chocolate chip pizza/cookie with ice cream on top).  The beer, well, it is not my favorite and it seems to be aimed at the average drinker but it isn't bad. On this occasion I had a pint of the Tatonka Russian Imperial Stout (8.5% ABV): It didn't taste high alcohol, but it also didn't taste like an RIS (which I associate with really deep, rich roast, raisin/plum notes, and chocolate-like flavors). It wasn't even as flavorful as Guinness or most other stouts, let alone a typical RIS. It did have a nice stiff head and it was pure dark brown.   I'd go back. The patio looks like it would be awesome on a warm day. I think I'd try to pick an ""off-peak"" time, though, to avoid the crowds.

6,Pratap C.,"San Diego, CA",373,74,246.0,3.0,2017-08-23,"Another disappointing visit to this branch leaves me baffled as to why certain establishments can't maintain the standard and quality across different locations. This disparity comes to the fore when the difference is in both table management and the quality of food. When a couple of kids are part of a party of four, one would think that managing locating them at a table, getting their orders and serving them their order must be a breeze but these guys surprisingly fell short. Firstly, having a server come by and give a glass of water, much less take an order in a moderately occupied restaurant, should not take 15 minutes.... but it did. Next, if the waitress has an opinion on the order, it should not turn into a tirade against items on their own menu. I've faced this situation in other places and I attribute this to overzealous yet well intentioned behaviors.  But then, when we decide to share dishes or drinks, they suggest giving you free stuff saying that if we decide to share they might as well throw in some free drinks. This reaction might cross a fine line between good service and weird service. Now coming  to the food served on the table, the corn dogs orders were generic enough but flavorful so the kids enjoyed it. The veggies that accompanied them were however not fresh or clean... the celery sticks were not cleaned well enough and the kids complained and we verified the presence of sand... not something we would associate with a good BJ's outlet. The quinoa bowl was average and I would not recommend it as opposed to other items on the menu. The quinoa and rice were under-cooked. The quantity of greens and tomatoes in the dish was way too much and the only saving grace was the perfectly seasoned and cooked salmon it came with. Thankfully, the black and bleu-house burger that we ordered was very good. This is one dish that BJs delivers on consistently and we are happy about that fact. The roasted garlic aioli is such an awesome addition to this burger and it goes very well with the applewood smoked bacon in the bun. Hopefully, as this establishment gets more feedback and gains more experience, the service and the food will improve and match up to what we have come to expect from BJs at other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3,3.36,3.59,3.59,2.9880000000000004,3.498

The small picture we saw was indicated to be a 16""x10"" with 12 slices. Gee, that should do it for the four of us! Turns out the 16""x10"" is an OVAL with the 10"" at its widest and 16"" at its longest (not a large rectangle as we supposed it to be). And, while it is flatbread, it is incredibly thin. And the topping; what topping? We were looking at the 5-cheese blend but not much of it. And 12 slices; while we thought 3 slices each would be great - turns out each slice is about 2""x1"" (this is a slice?) - kinda bite-size. We didn't think much of the mushroom portion of the topping, either. All in all, a HUGE disappointment as to quantity, just not enough to satisfy four people. Appetizer, perhaps; Pizza, not. And, I would have thought the waiter would have let us know just how small it would be for four people. Gee, and all that for only $15. Oh, yeah, in all fairness, the taste was pretty good for a sample. Don't know if we'll be back to try something else or not (probably not).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=100,3.28,3.51,3.51,,3.418
4,Crystal N.,"San Jose, CA",869,155,431.0,3.0,2017-11-30,"Mondays are half off pizzas! Their pizzas are pretty decent and you can split two flavors on one pizza. 2 large pizzas was more than enough for 5 girls. Happy hour is also nice because some appetizers are $6 and drinks also have deals. I have to say the food is pretty decent but it's the service that ruined it for me. It took the waiter forever to get us even just water and to take our order. We were outside in the patio so there may be a lack of waiters or people are just not attentive. Everyone is walking so fast it's hard to wave someone down and when you do, they forget about what you ask for and the process happens all over again. The food also took ridiculously long to get out to us- at least 30+ minutes for appetizers! It shouldn't be that hard to make artichoke dip!!! We all just getting hangrier out here. :( Overall all, food is good, but the whole experience just took way too long! And backless stools aren't fun to wait on outside. Not a place worth going to unless you want to wait for expensive food (unless there's a deal or coupon).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3,3.36,3.53,3.53,,3.462
61,Amanda P.,"Campo, CA",85,5,,4.0,2017-12-02,"Me and a friend came here for a late lunch on a Saturday, we had no wait for our seating and our server, Bonnie came right away to take our drink orders. She apologized in advance and let us know she was very busy and she seemed to be one of the only servers working at the time. She actually didn't have us waiting very long at all. I ordered a burger and when i bit into it, there was still paper on the cheese! We let our server know right away and she took the burger off our bill and continued to check on us regularly. She even suggested a few different beers to sample. Thank you Bonnie for being so great to us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=40,3.36,3.54,3.54,,3.4680000000000004
25,Alexus A.,"Escondido, CA",78,3,,1.0,2017-12-05,We ordered food online and the food never even got picked up from BJ's by the delivery service. I was charged $10 for the delivery service fee and would like my money back because we ended up just picking up the food ourselves 45 mins passed the estimated delivery time. The ice cream was melted and the food was cold. BJ's just let us take the food home cold!! But replaced the ice cream. Worst delivery experience ever!!

66,Rachel L.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-08,"I realized that BJ's is a chain restaurant but I've heard good things about it. However, after my first time, I was left really unimpressed.  I initially noticed how pricey the menu was but I put that aside in my mind because I figured, ""the food must be some good stuff!"" Nah. Food is OK. My friend said it best, ""Yup that pasta... taste like pasta."" Bottom line, it's edible and nothing special. Some of the dishes lacked any sort of flavor at all.  Portion sizes were also not a big as I expected them to be considering how expensive the entrees were. Spent about 60$ of OK food to fill just two people and a smidge of leftovers. Yikes.  My server was nice though so I'm giving a star for that. I'm a server myself and I could tell that he was going out of his way to be friendly and accommodating.  I really think I missed the hype here. But that's just me, and I'm kind of exhausted by these weirdly overpriced ""high-end"" American restaurant joints. I won't return, unless it's strictly for pizookis I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=40,3.32,3.49,3.49,,3.422

3,Christine K.,"San Diego, CA",1388,943,1688.0,4.0,2017-12-29,"BJ's is a decent restaurant for food but it's mainly known for their Pizookies. I didn't know that they actually switched locations but I went with my family. All BJ's restaurants look the same. Staff is nice. So we ordered 2 large pizzas, Pepperoni and the Great White for 4 adults, one kid and an infant. The pepperoni came with a lot of meat. I personally liked the Great White much better. The creamy alfredo sauce had the right anount of sauce to pizza ratio and the roasted garlic really brought out the flavors. We also got a kids - chicken alfredo pasta which was pretty big for a average kid and good. Get the pizookie trio. You can opt with 3 different flavors. I went with chocolate chip, white chocolate macadamia nut and cookies and cream. All delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3,3.28,3.42,3.42,,3.3640000000000003

The place is known for their pizookie desserts, but I think they're just okay and not the bee's knees that so many people think they are. Service is fine--it's not polished but it gets the job done. This place stays open late after most other restaurants close. That's a smart business decision since I don't think there's really much else this place has going for it in the highly competitive restaurant industry.

0,Catherine B.,"San Diego, CA",117,5,,5.0,2018-01-11,"2 things that earned these guys 5 stars. First, my party's dining experience was flawless.  Our server, Meghann, was friendly,  fast, and answered all of our questions.  I ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon and it was both very tasty and healthy.  The rest of my party had different burgers- all were cooked to the specified temperatures and everyone was enjoyed their dinner.  I think the hit of the night was the boneless BBQ wing appetizer, they were so good! Second,  I was a total jerk to the staff over a misunderstanding,  and they handled it like champs.  I have a severe allergy to nuts, but not peanuts. I told my server I had a nut allergy, she came back and said they don't use any peanut oil or anything like that so I should be good. I clarified peanuts were ok wth me (they're legumes, not tree nuts) and she gave me the go ahead to eat the stuffed mushroom appetizer. After eating 2 I realize the sauce on them is a pesto sauce and I panic,  thinking there might be pine nuts (this has gotten me before,  and quite recently too; not everyone remembers pine nuts) and once I realize this my anxiety causes my heart rate to rise and for me to think that I was having a reaction.  I started to walk out, speaking quite harshly to a host about what I thought had happened. Quite quickly a manager gets involved and reassured me that there were no nuts in the pesto sauce, she even went so far as to bring out a comprehensive packet on all of their food allergens. I felt like such a dope, but they were so kind and understanding about it. Thank you BJ's for looking out for my health, your understanding,  and for the great food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3,3.32,3.46,3.46,,3.4040000000000004
