6,Shelby S.,"Inarajan, Guam",3,31,56.0,3.0,2012-07-18,"The only reason I give it a three is because I would hate for tourists to come to Guam for a short time and spend one of their meals here; I would hate for a visitor to come to Guam and visit the chains. We have great local food, but as far as chains go CPK so far is doing it right! REVIEW: The first thing that I would have to say about CPK is that if I walked into their restaurant and the only thing they had on their menu was their Thai Crunch Salad I would stay! Hands down one of my favorite salads and probably the best salad on their menu.  You cannot go wrong with any of their pizzas. I'd suggest the Wild Mushroom or Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage. I get either one depending on who I'm eating with, my vegan friend or my meat-loving mom. That's another great thing about CPK, they have something that caters to any diet. I've had their pastas before. They're delicious, but expensive...anyway CPK is not the place I come to when they crave pasta. Every time I come here the service is quick and friendly and most importantly the restaurant is clean!!! Considering the amount of people and noise CPK is actually pretty comfortable.  The first negative would have to be the parking. The parking is absolutely ridiculous. Whoever chose their location should have taken parking into consideration. The only parking available is shared by a public beach (about 10 stalls are always flooded) and although there is parking that is shared by the hotel I believe there is only ONE level of underground parking. Because parking is so bad I would have to say they're lucky they're located in a hotel in Tumon (this isn't a nod to the person who chose the location I believe they could have found somewhere in Tumon with better parking) where they can get a lot of foot traffic. However in my opinion, if you want to stay open you need to cater to your local clientele and I believe better parking would be a huge step in that direction. Another negative would be that they're always crowded. If you're not a fan of crowds or would like a more intimate setting avoid CPK. However if you have a large and loud group of people and could care less about noise well then CPK is a-okay for you! Overall, the good food, even though it is a chain, brings people back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon?start=40,3.66,3.66,3.66,3.66,3.6600000000000006

But I was kinda disappointed in my order:/ We got the ""Crispy Mac N' Cheese""  * our classic Mac N' Cheese lightly fried with panko, served on a creamy cheese sauce * -- please refer to my attached images on a visual of what I received. For the most part. It was spiral pasta (not the ones usually used for Mac-n-cheese) balled up into a chicken nugget form and then fried in panko. Just disappointing because our party ordered 3 orders of it and we were all disappointed:(",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

Full Caesar salad with chicken is a perfect lunch and nothing satisfies a craving like the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza with bacon (smash up of 2 different pizzas). The warm butter cake a la mode is perfect desert if you have already given up on worrying about calories",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tumon,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

We came here 2 days in a row to have some thin crust pizza and salads. The Thai salad is really good but the avocado was very bruised the second time. I like the thin crust with artichoke but the one with sausage and some sweet sauce was terrible. For some reason the artichoke pizza tasted different the second time. Like the food, the service is inconsistent. First server wasn't friendly and did not provide a bag or utensils. Second server provided everything without being asked.

Had to ask several people for a high chair and 3 different people for refills on water because the staff wasn't very attentive. It wasn't a busy day. It's not the same flavors or menu from the CPK in the mainland and the flavor profile is definitely different and lacking. You're paying more for an okay meal that takes a long time to arrive to your table. And I love CPK and would frequently visit the restaurants in California and was never disappointed there.

The cheese was kind of watery. Not a lot of chips were provided to finish the dip. I had to ask for more chips and was charged $2. This is the only restaurant that I've been to that charges for refills for chips. The pizza looked like they just poured sliced avocado and lettuce. It was not as good as their other pizzas.  The spicy seafood pasta was really good though. Not overwhelmingly spicy but with a little kick. I was disappointed that they removed the portobello mushroom ravioli from the menu. Hope they bring it back. Next time, I'll stick to ordering their older items. Their service varies from good to exceptional.
