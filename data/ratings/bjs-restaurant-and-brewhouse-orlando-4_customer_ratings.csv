Aside from the irritating and persistently pushy waitor, we ordered the southwest eggrolls; they were delicious I definitely recommend trying them. Cesar salad was average and the pasta was too.

He was very attentive and knowledgable of the menu and drink menu.  Our son is allergic to soy, Martin made sure that not only his meal did not have soy but checked to see if any of our food did as well, in case we wanted to share.  Our son also received a red napkin(for children)which did not contain a knife.  The atmosphere was spot on, very clean and modern.  I highly recommend them!

I had a few friends with me who never dined at BJ's so he made several suggestions based upon other guest feedback on items, suggested we sample the beer before we committed which I felt was such an honest thing to do and he got the order RIGHT! My friends are pains and we included this, took off that, substituted all kinds of stuff we were sure something was going to be missing but it was PERFECT!

112,Cailen L.,"Orlando, FL",3,17,5.0,2.0,2014-09-17,"I've been to many BJ's around the area. I was given an opportunity to experience this new BJ's' soft open for friends and family. The service was wonderful and the server and trainers were funny and engaging. And the food was great. Since then, I have gone there four other times. All I can say is, it's time for new management. Progressively, the quality has gone down. Everything from the salt and pepper shakers showing clear signs of never having been washed or changed out (the salt inside the salt shakers inside the restaurant was BROWN, to the ketchup showing clear signs of never having been wiped (we came in right at 11am and the ketchup bottle was caked with dried ketchup not once but twice when I was here for lunch), this restaurant shows very clearly that this BJ's has NO cleaning standards.  The service? Meh. It's a mixed bag. There are some great ones, but they are probably moving on to better restaurants by now. And all that is left are the crappy ones who just can't manage tables. The most recent time I was there, we waited 15 minutes to be initially greeted outside for lunch (the place had maybe 2 or 3 other tables in it at the time). I was told that a server would be right out and she was taking my drink order, then the drinks came back with another server and I was told that someone else was going to actually be taking care of me. Well, this server had waited on us before. The server is EXTREMELY slow at service and seems very inefficient at best for this kind of job. I must say though that there are a few great servers in that restaurant who actually have a personality that is engaging and also knowledgeable and I would suggest specifically asking for a server who is fun and experienced at the host stand to avoid my experiences.  Management: Also, one thing I have no seen since soft opening was an actual floor manager. I'm not sure they even have one. Never once has anyone come to my table and asked how things were. They must just really not give a care in the world about how their restaurant is seen. Because I would've had a lot to say. The food: Eh, it's burgers and the standard BJ fare. It's ok. Nothing superb, but nothing to really complain about either. I don't usually send food back anyways, and I never have here. This BJ's is at the time of this writing the newest BJ's in the Orlando area, but from my experience it is the worst kept and run. They need to seriously rethink their cleanliness, their efficiency, and their communication if they ever want me to come back. Head on over to Chuy's right next door is you actually want a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=120,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

126,Sarah H.,"Orlando, FL",124,215,5.0,5.0,2014-10-19,"I have always been a fan of BJs. Being someone who is on a Gluten-free diet, I always support restaurants that offer GF options. BJ's even has a dedicated GF menu you can choose from which helps considering the enormous size of their regular menu. I LOVE their gluten free pizookie which is a warm chocolate chip cookie cake with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I do wish they would offer maybe one more option for the pizookies to be gluten free but I am not upset about that considering most restaurants don't offer a single option for dessert for me to enjoy. To this day I have not found a better GF pizza than BJ's. They only offer one size like most other places for GF but it is not disappointing in the least. It is thin crust and most of their toppings are also GF so the sky's the limit, however each topping is going to cost you. I am vegetarian also so the cheese pizza is right up my alley. Will be a lifetime customer so long as they continue offering GF options as amazing as the ones I get to enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=140,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804

I was tempted to order it. I did order a Gluten Free Pizza and I built and personalized it. My choices were: Calamota Olives. Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Italian Sausage and Mushrooms. My husband ordered  BBQ Chicken Pizza. Our appetizer was Corn Fritters w/ Bacon Aoli. Awesome. You get 4 of them for I believe $3.50-$3.75. Oooh and the Gluten Free pizza comes in 10 in.  Plus the extra toppings for it is only $1.00. There regular pizza dough sizes and prices are different. The gluten free dough is thin crust. But not thin like New York Style. It's just right. I enjoyed my choice in gluten free crust and toppings as well. The other sizes are 6in. 9in. 12in. 15in. I believe the last two are correct.

I have never seen him clean his plate like that before;) We ordered the calamari (good), bacon mac n cheese (awesome) and spinach stuffed mushrooms (great.) Our waitress was very nice and honest. I was in between the steak or country fried chicken. I asked her what she prefers and she mentioned that the steaks often come out of the kitchen over cooked 50%  of the time. So based on that I ordered the chicken. And I'm glad I did!!! The gravy over the chicken and mashed potatoes was awesome! My husband however forgo her advice and ordered a ribeye, which came out over cooked. By the time  another ribeye came back mid rare, our son had finished his birthday ice cream cookie. I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the kitchen has some work to do:( the place was half empty and there is no excuse for over cooking a steak. Hopefully they'll get their act in gear.

84,Courtney M.,"Orlando, FL",9,24,10.0,1.0,2015-06-17,"Although I love BJs food and atmosphere, my boyrfriend and I had a horrible experience here recently and I thought I'd let ya'll know about it. Rather than recant everything, I'm just going to post the letter I sent in to BJs customer service.  ""Dear BJs, After a recent visit to your location in Orlando, Fl, I felt the need to give a little feedback and constructive criticism.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner around seven o'clock and the restaurant was packed! We were excited because obviously a packed restaurant means good food. When we approached the host stand we were informed that the wait was nearing an hour, but since we were already there it seemed a waste to leave and dine somewhere else. During our wait we sat at the bar and enjoyed three rounds of cocktails recommended by the bar tender, and they were delicious and refreshingly strong! After our wait we were seated and told a server would be with us soon. Normally I wouldn't mind waiting for our waitress to attend to our table (I also wait tables so I know how it can be when the restaurant is busy) but forty five minutes after we had been seated I decided to pop by the host stand to see if everything was okay. The host sincerely apologized and told me she'd find my server and send her our way. It was apparent that the server did not know we were seated or that we were her responsibility, but the miscommunication still occurred.  She happily took our order and brought our drinks super quick, and I was grateful that she put in the effort to make up for the wait. Our food was brought out not long after and although my boyfriend was happy with his meal, sadly I wasn't. I've been to BJs many times before (in the location in Palm Beach, my hometown) and without fail I always order kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad. It is literally my favorite salad in the world, and when I don't have time to stop by my local BJs to pick one up I try to make it at home, but it's never as good. Our waitress asked if everything was okay with our food, and although I hate to be ""that customer,"" I asked if she could ask the kitchen what went wrong because the salad was missing the best part, the Brussels sprouts and blueberries! A quick trip to the kitchen and back confirmed that the kitchen was actually out of those items. Of course I was upset because my favorite salad wasn't complete without those ingredients, but I didn't mind reordering because I love all the food on the menu. However I was upset that I wasn't informed of the ingredient outage before I placed my order. Disappointed as I was I reordered and enjoyed my meal and date.  When the bill came and my boyfriend pulled out his wallet to pay I noticed that the charge for the salad was still on there. While only a minor mistake, no fault of our sweet waitress, it was slightly annoying that had I not noticed the charge I would have paid for a salad that I did not eat, no less enjoy. Also, it seemed odd that after many miscommunications within the restaurant that led to a poor experience for my boyfriend and I that the manager didn't make time to come by and apologize. It only takes a minute to stop by a customers table, but as a guest it means a lot for a manager to recognize and apologize for the restaurants mistakes. As much as I love the food (I mean really that salad is so good), I don't know how quick I would be to return to the BJs near me. It just seemed that our almost hundred dollar bill was not indicative of the service or food quality. Hopefully after receiving this letter some changes will be made and I can go back to BJs to enjoy my favorite salad and the amazing cocktails. Much love,  Courtney McGowan"" After sending this letter I received a phone call directly from the manager at this location, his name is Cedric, and I really appreciated that. He assured me that he would make up for this experience and even invited me back so we could be introduced. I was excited to go back and meet the manager, as well as have a do over for our meal. A few days later I got an email for a twenty dollar gift card to BJs. I've never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I was almost offended. Considering how much I spent on my last trip to BJs and how bad the evening turned out to be, I don't really think twenty dollars did much to make up for it, and if I truly wanted a redo of that night I would have to spend another eighty dollars. I'm sorry to say that I probably won't even be bothered to use the card because it would only cover one round of drinks and I'd still be left with the terrible service. My recommendation to all is to save your money because the service is almost guaranteed to be sub par, and being more concerned with money than customer satisfaction, BJs wont do much to make up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=100,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.308,2.92

I have been to 4 different BJ'S and they were good but here... the wait, the service, and the food were bad.  We were a group of 6 and we were there celebrating a birthday. It was a saturday night and yes it was busy but not that much for the kind of service we got. I have too many things(bad) to say about this visit to this BJ'S so I'm going to number them: 1. The wait: we were told there was a 45 min wait to get a table and we're seated an hour and a half later. The wait to get our food was 45 minutes. 2. The service: First let's talk about the drinks. When the drinks got there, the waitress spilled my friend's water, on him (an accident can happen to anyone, but fix it). She said someone would come to clean up the spilled water... no one ever showed up and we ate with a puddle at our feet. The waitress never brought back the water she spilled, my friend had to get up and go to the bar to get a water. She took forever to refill the rest of the drinks, two of my friends had to stop eating at one point to wait for their soda refills. The rest of the service was bad, friend 2 never got a silverware and napkin. Friend 3 and 4 ordered pizza and they got their food 20 minutes after everyone else. Friend 3 never got a plate even though we asked for it, so friend 4 had to share her plate. 3. The food: Now the food, it could have been so much better, like in other BJ's. I had a burger that I ordered medium, it was burnt. Friend 1 had a baked pasta, the picture on the menu looked nothing like what he got. The dish was not even filled half way and it was mostly cheese. Friend 2 ordered a medium well burger and got it raw.

Not sure if I would recommend or not. Good management intervention and meal but poor service. Overall in reading the other reviews I would say the ones that said their Service was poor are probably pretty consistent but the ones that wrote their Service was great are probably plants because there was a lot of open tables and a lot of people waiting to get seated... clearly some of the waitresses do an excellent job there but overall I would say their service needs a tune-up which is odd because the manager seemed pretty squared away and the food was good... the atmosphere is great...they just need to do something about the weak links that are bringing their service down. That said the waitress we had was very polite though clearly very distracted by things other than work as can be evidence in losing the order for over an hour before she realizes she hadn't put it in.... kind of of conflicting review I realize.

39,Paul L.,"Longwood, FL",258,421,895.0,2.0,2016-07-14,"Friends of ours from out of town suggested meeting up with their kids at a BJs, which left me wondering why we'd be eating at the food-vending place of a wholesale club.  Call me cloistered, but there being no @BJsRestaurants and brewhouse around us, I hadn't heard of them.  So we didn't even check out the reviews on Yelp before hand.  But when we arrived ahead of them, and we were left to sit in the waiting area (it's their 'policy'), we had a chance to look in @Yelp. Uh-oh! I hate giving bad reviews, I really do.  If nothing else, it indicates I had a bad experience (duh!), and nobody likes THAT. But as sharp a pen/tongue as I possess, I enjoy giving compliments so much more. So I thought: may be the RECENT reviews were better?  No such luck - recent 4 months has a lower avg than any other 4-month period.  I mean, when the '1's outnumber the '5's, it tells you something. Still, I was determined not to be biased by that.  Each experience is different, right?   Alas - the slow forgetful service was evident right away.  We were a big table of 9 - hard to miss.  But it was not till at least 10 minutes after we were all seated that the waiter, with stuff in his hands, came to us and said, haven't forgotten about you - gonna put these down and come right over.  When another few minutes had passed, I looked for him, and observed him going to EVERY one of the other 4 or 5 tables he had, going to the kitchen, to the station etc., BEFORE he came back over (and not till after some unseemly arm-waving to get his attention).  The ladies tried a couple of sample beers, but he never bothered to come back to get the 'real' order until much later and after much pleading. When he brought the water, he was one short; without prompting, he said, ""I'll bring that other water after I take your order..."" and then, those famous 'last' words, ""I WON'T FORGET!""  I don't need to tell you what happened...   The spinach dip came with very few chips; not his fault, but since we couldn't get his attention, we ended up having to flag down another person to get more chips, brought only after the dip's gone cold.  No one came to ask how everything was after the entrees were brought, or else we would have informed him that one of the pizza orders was wrong: ""Pepperoni"", instead of ""cheese"".  Now to be fair, that is totally understandable since they sound so similar - I mean, you can say ""pepperoni"" before taking a picture, and it'll have the same effect!   Thankfully, the food was not all bad - having read that one review, and seen the picture, having no fried breaded rock posing as a french fry is always a blessing.  The mahi mahi shrimp dish and my wife's chicken spinach and quinoa dinner were by not out-of-this-world-write-home-NOW delicious, but they by themselves would have earned a 3-star rating. Not bad for value either - better value than the ""best beginnings"" app at $18.75 or the spin dip at (9.95).  Credit to the waiter for letting 'reminding' us there's a dupe, in that the spin dip is also in the best beginnings (which I knew).  The artichoke used in the spin dip was unusually fibrous, and the buffalo sauce with the chicken nuggets was arguably too salty, but those are minor flaws.  My friend's deep-dish pizza, though, was just between lukewarm and cold - only marginally better after we asked them to warm it up and it was brought back too soon.  As Christians, we had a nice chuckle amongst ourselves about how we don't care for Laodicean cuisine! They had me sign up for their rewards program while we were waiting.  I didn't bother pulling the card out when I paid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,3.1440000000000006,2.36

I TRULY FELT TAKEN CARE OF, and this is not a standard procedure from any restaurant, that was truly passion for the industry and place of work...that's why I believe management's doing a great job! Our server was on point, accurate, and kind. We tried to make her job as easy as possible and she took great care of us even while she was busy. I truly enjoyed my dining experience here... and the food was just a ""complement"".... the service made it happen!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=40,2.44,2.79,2.79,3.54,2.6500000000000004
74,Mikaela N.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,,3.0,2016-07-26,"I decided to open a Yelp account now that I visit many restaurants in Orlando along with family and friends. I've been eating at this International Drive location for almost a year now after relocating from Louisiana. I enjoy the Jambalaya (even if it's not exactly like the best back home) and this place isn't far from our apartment. I was a hostess and server years back but to this day, I'm picky when it comes to the staff who will be helping my visits go well. We usually ask to sit in Edie's area because she's on point and knows her stuff. We can't always sit in her area because of long wait times. I noticed things changing these past 2 months there. I don't know if there was a change of management, but things don't seem to run smoothly after 10 at night. They seem shortstaffed later at night even though they supposedly close at midnight. Our visits between 6 and 9 or 10 are enjoyable, but if a group of us show up there after 10, the experience changes and food is usually not up to par maybe because there aren't enough cooks after a certain time. I know the servers don't have anything to do with that because it's management overall who decides if they have enough staff on site or not. I hope these reviews are looked at by management. The reviews for this location are lower than other BJ's restaurants nearby and management should strive to make things run smoother there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=60,2.36,2.8,2.8,3.34,2.624

And you can never beat unlimited refills :) I chose the fire roasted barbacoa seasoned chicken which exceeded my expectations. It was light and juicy and the spice was quite subtle (I don't do spice well.) It was served over a bed of brown rice and black beans, neither were particularly of note.

He insisted on explaining it anyway and left the table. He eventually came back with waters and never explained it again once my wife was seated.  He asked if we had questions but didn't seem to know any of the answers. He was confused on the daily rib special and even the fact that they offered a kale salad. Very uneducated on the menu basics.  We placed our order and i asked to have my drink now my wife wanted to wait. He decided to hold both drinks for about 20 mins until the food arrived. Only thing was we had to ask 2 additional times for him to bring us our drinks.  My wife had a small wedge salad appetizer and when she finished she put the plate on the edge of the table. After 4 visits and asking multiple times to take the plate he never did. I had to almost literally open his hand and place the plate in it for him to take it.  On top of everything when we tried to ask a question he would start walking away and didn't really listen to us.   To cap it all off when I went to provide my rewards number he took the phone and disappeared for about 10 mins.

So I had a simple order of Atlantic Salmon with Double Broccoli, simple right?! Apparently not. My order arrived with the salmon with rice and  mixed vegetables. I advised that this was incorrect.

The 3rd time around they partially removed the mixed vegetables and slapped the original salmon on the plate omitting the sauce.  At this point I take my plate and find a manager. I explain the situation and I get barely an apology. My good comes out and IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SAUCE.  I have an issue with the fact that the manager did not touch the table to make sure that my order was correct. The service was very poor and I did not feel as though they cared enough.  To top it off, we ordered 2 pizzokie's and needed additional spoons. We asked the guy who dropped off the desserts. Nothing. We asked our waiter for spoons. Nothing.

I'm not a big fan of their appetizers as its all just yesterday's cheese, meat and vegetables fried plus a dipping sauce and then priced too high.

These might have been at the bottom of the storage container. Not good.  We then ordered a deep dish pizza and it took a LONG time to come out.

Mom had the deep dish ziti and said it was fantastic! Plenty of pasta, cheese, sauce and meat. The pasta was served with a few pieces of garlic bread. She gave me one, and it was delicious! I was in the mood for something different (for me) and ended up in the buckwheat pasta dish. It was delicious! Plenty of pasta, chicken and broccoli with a peanut style, somewhat spicy Asian sauce. While it was a tad too much sauce, it was so tasty. I wish I could have taken it back to my hotel... The service really impressed me. They were not pushy when it came to ordering appetizers, gave us plenty of time and were so friendly!  They have a full bar! My mom enjoyed an o'douls  and I had a Pinot Grigio.  BJ's is a great place to have a wonderful meal and I recommend it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4,3.4,3.11,3.11,,3.226

142,Fred K.,"Gilbert, AZ",4,93,,3.0,2017-04-12,"I was visiting Florida and there was a BJ's across the street from the hotel we were staying in so, for familiarity sake we went here on two separate occasions for lunch and for dessert. Both times it was really slow in the restaurant which generally means quick service. Incorrect on both occasions here.  On the lunch occasion when we came in there were only 4 other tables seated. We ordered our drinks which took about 10 minutes to get to us which was weird considering it was only water and soda. I got the Thursday special which is ribs and a mini pizookie. Food came out about 25 minutes later, which again, seems like a bit of a long wait. What I found odd was that I got a full rack of ribs and they came out as two half racks which is fine. But, one half of my racks was hot and tasted good, good moisture in the ribs, great BBQ sauce covering. The other half was warm,dry,no sauce. So I am not too sure how that happens.  So we also came in a different night just for dessert at about 9PM. Again, very slow. A few people at the bar, maybe 6 tables sat. After we were sat our waitress didn't show up for at least 15 minutes. We ordered 3 pizookies to share among the 5 of us. It took them over a half an hour to get there. They were absolutely delicious and I will never say anything against the food on this occasion, but why? Why did it take that long with an empty restaurant? I just don't understand why this particular place has such slow service. I would not want to walk in there on a busy night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4,3.32,3.09,3.09,,3.182

Unfortunately we came kind of late on a Saturday after spending the day at Magic Kingdom. Our waitress was really nice but the kitchen and bar took absolutely forever to make our orders. None of us were too thrilled about that, even our friends almost cancelled their drink/food orders. My boyfriend had ordered one of the new margaritas on the menu which he though was terrible. Good thing our waitress was reasonable, she replaced it with no questions asked and didn't put it on the bill.

153,Katie G.,"Hopkins, MN",29,9,20.0,2.0,2017-05-20,"Came for a quick lunch during my stay for a conference. The bar and restaurant had a decent amount of people but it wasn't too busy so I figured I'd be able to get in and out quickly and back to the conference. However, the bartender had all the tables and spots up to the bar, and was getting his butt kicked. As he is racing around trying to get to everyone, servers are just casually walking around minding their own business. Amidst the chaos, he messes up an order or two, and completely forgets to put into an order for another table all together. Customers had to ask for refills, silverware, their checks, etc. all things that a solid server/bartender has foresight to do before they are asked. I've been a server and manager in a restaurant so I feel his pain in being so busy that you can't catch up. It's upsetting he didn't ask for help, but I'm more disappointed in the management. Not once did the manager walk through to gage service and needs of both staff and patrons. This manager was either incompetent in his role or just didn't care. I'm not sure what is worse! The food took longer than expected and left many customers (a majority were also there from the same conference and were on a time crunch) rushing to eat when the food finally arrived. I got the California Chicken Club, which tastes good- pretty standard.  If you're looking for a quick lunch and good service, I recommend going to a different restaurant. There are plenty of other options in the area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4,3.2,3.0,3.0,,3.0800000000000005

I simply don't accept that ""the kitchen got busy"" when food is streaming out of the kitchen to tables seated an hour after we arrived and we still don't have our meals.  Tell me the truth and tell me how you're going to fix it.

137,Irene L.,"Orlando, FL",45,26,10.0,1.0,2017-07-23,"So I was out to lunch with two of my coworkers and we decided to visit for lunch this past Friday. We had gone to the BJ's on Millenia separately and had a great experience. That means we should have a great experience at this location, right? Wrong. We arrived at about 12:15pm and got seated immediately. The restaurant didn't seem too busy which we thought was a good sign. There were lots of empty tables in our area. After about 10 minutes, a woman that seemed like the manager asked if our server had stopped by our table yet and we explained that they did not. She proceeded to take our drink order but we didn't see our drinks until another 10 minutes later when our server finally came to our table. 20 minutes, to get a water, a sweet and an unsweet tea. Strike 1. Our server apologized for our wait and asked if we were ready to order. We were so we ordered cauliflower barbacoa tacos, penne pasta, and a California club (lightly toasted with no avocado). It took our server probably 10 minutes to put the order in the tablet. She seemed like she was struggling lowith what seemed like a simple task. Strike 2. We're already 30 minutes into our visit with no food on our table. Let me remind you, we were on our lunch break from work. So we chatted, and waited...and waited some more. Our server came to our table with a tray of drinks and was about to put one on the table. But she paused and realized the drinks weren't for our table. So she apologized for the wait (again), and said she JUST checked on our food and it should be right out. Lies. Like I said...she was struggling. We've now been at the restaurant 50 minutes with no food. Strike 3. Realizing how long we've been waiting and that we had to get back to work, our server was walking by and we asked her for our food to go. She once again apologized and said no problem and rushed back to the kitchen. Moments later, our food comes out boxed up and ready to go. Uh, what the heck happened here? She apologized again and we asked for our check. She came back with the check, another apology from the waitress, and paid cash so we can as soon as we could and not have to wait for the snail in molasses service. I've never had so many apologies in a visit to a restaurant before. Obviously, there was a problem that could not get resolved. We got our food back to work and now had cold food. My tacos tasted good but it would have been nicer to enjoy them warm. My coworkers sandwich was almost black and had huge chunks of avocado in it. What happened to lightly toasted and no avocado? So let's just say, our experience was unacceptable and we will not be visiting this location as a group or with friends or family. You can guarantee we'll let our friends and family know of our experience as well to save them the trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4,2.92,2.91,2.91,,2.9139999999999997

A standard chain with decent food was our choice and this place was near our hotel. She was happy, I was ""meh"". Our server was awesome though. I wish I could remember his name because everyone needs to have him wait on them. He pulls no punches and treated us like his friends. Some of the best service I'd ever had. He recommended the Avocado Egg Rolls as an app and while I initially passed on it, I decided to get them when ordering my entree. The egg rolls had avocado in them of course, but also cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, chipotle peppers and spices with a side of sweet tamarind sauce. Holy wow, these were pretty dang good. My friend took two and was done with them. No problem here, I ate the rest. She ordered mozzarella sticks and while they were good, you can get those anywhere and that's no fun. I think I'm fancy so I ordered a drink, the Blood Orange Pom Sangria but I neglected to see that the liquor is Fireball Whiskey and Merlot. Oh man. This is not a drink for an empty stomach nor to be guzzled but it is delicious.  We ordered our entrees. I chose the Seared Ahi Salad and she choose the Deep Dish Ziti. My salad was piled high with a lot of veggies. After feeling like I ate like crap at Universal this was my way of balancing everything out. It was great but I think that there was a bit too much seasoning on my ahi to my liking. I ate it anyway. My friend said her ziti was really good. I tried some and again, just ""meh"". You can really taste all the Italian seasonings and spices in it and it's not lacking in flavor at all, but it didn't WOW me.
