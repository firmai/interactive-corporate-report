12,Nicole G.,"Montreal, Canada",10,65,2.0,3.0,2013-03-07,"I've been to Applebee's before but have never bother to write a review. I came here with my parents after a shopping jaunt down across the border. We sat at the bar to avoid having to wait for a table. Our bartender/waitress was very friendly and accommodating. She served us drinks right away, and came back once we were ready to order. I ordered the Honey BBQ Chicken Sandwich, whereas dad ordered the trio appetizer (two orders of traditional wings and mozzarella sticks) as did mom (but she opted for two orders of the chicken wonton tacos and the pretzel with beer cheese sauce). My sandwich was flavourful and juicy, mind you I would suggest using a sturdier bun; I struggled to keep it together while it quickly fell apart in my hands. And I got maybe 10 french fries on my plate. But all in all, it hit the spot. I was lucky enough to try a mozzarella stick (yum) and a bit of mom's chicken wonton taco; I liked the contrast between the tender chicken and crunch of the wonton and coleslaw. But what I would go back for HANDS-DOWN is the pretzel with beer cheese sauce. I am in love with the doughy goodness that is the pretzel stick and the cheesy goodness of the beer cheese sauce. I am a huge fan of beer (mind you it's pretty faded and isn't really noticed; maybe using a stronger stout would enhance the flavour) and cheese, and marrying the two is a brilliant idea.  All in all, great customer service and decent food. I will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
11,Matt R.,"Morrisonville, NY",0,26,,1.0,2014-01-25,"We've been here twice and both times our meal with less than good. I've been visting the Applebees chain for years and this restaurant is worse than most. The waitresses both times were friendly but not attentive. The food was downright depressing- colorless, almost tasteless, and a little mushy. We tried fish and steak the first time and burgers the second time.  Try somewhere else. There's a lot better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
10,Upstate Y.,"Potsdam, NY",13,294,356.0,3.0,2014-06-26,Food was good.  Staff was quick.  Only problem....the place is LOADED with people coming over from Quebec so get ready to wait for a seat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
3,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",103,245,496.0,2.0,2015-01-05,"It's been a year since my first review and I've been to Applebees about a dozen times since, with some disappointing experiences the more I ventured off and tried new things from the menu. Do NOT get the riblets - they are dry, difficult to eat. Nothing like regular ribs. These are full of tiny bones you have to pick through. They had an all-you-can-eat promo for these, but you have to wait a while to get a second serving and it's just not satisfying, fall off the bone type ribs. Do NOT get the fish and chips - Overcooked, my fish tasted freezer burnt The 4 cheese macaroni dish I liked so much seems to be increasingly sweet every time I go. Their cheese sauce tastes more like the honey glazed chicken sauce. The pasta is often mushy and not cheesy enough, it's all too sweet when I'm expecting a savory dish. Boneless chicken wings are hit or miss. Either they are drenched in sauce making them soggy, or too dry. I only recommend Applebees for half price apps during happy hour, 2 to 5pm and after 9pm. Their food isn't worth full price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
8,Francois T.,"Montreal, Canada",0,4,16.0,4.0,2015-03-01,"I stopped at this Applebee's while going to Whiteface Mountain with some friends and wanted to show them what this restaurant was about. My friends weren't too pleased with the service. It took an hour to get served and the restaurant was not even half full. The waitress was really nice however and this is why I give them a 4 star instead of a 3 star. She fully deserved her tip, she chatted with us to entertain us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
9,Peter F.,"Burlington, VT",69,59,16.0,4.0,2015-03-04,"It's an Applebees - its reasonable priced a-step-above-fast-food food. This location was quick, food was satisfactory, service was good. What more do you want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
4,Chrissy N.,"Middletown, NY",16,90,168.0,5.0,2016-05-09,"I don't like to write reviews for chain restaurants because I mean... Applebee's is Applebee's is Applebee's. However, with a plethora of choices in a quarter of a mile around here, I feel like I need to pump this place up so people know this is where to go if you're in the area.  I travel solo so I sat at the bar... the bartenders on Sunday night 5/8 were exceptional. They made killer drinks, very friendly, personable and made this awkward ""I'm sitting by myself"" thing much less awkward. I was bummed that I was traveling on Mother's Day and the bartender must have seen that sadness on my face... she wished me a Happy Mother's Day, asked about my kids, etc.  Food was Applebee's... it was enjoyable. I will be coming here again to sit at the bar, for great mixed drinks, friendly banter and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
7,Paul P.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,6,1.0,1.0,2016-08-19,WTF? The menu looks great.  Lots of selection. They look like they specialize in steak... Wood fired USDA prime. Sign me up. Got an 8 Oz medium rare. Wow.  They should not cut or cook steak. Not a touch of red in that sad thin little cut. Sides were also not very good.  Was with family.  Kids had cheesy Bread pizza which was awful.. Tested it and understood why they could not finish.  I would say avoid and if you choose to come lower expectations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
6,Eve M.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Montreal, Canada",10,58,10.0,4.0,2016-10-09,I have to say that the manager Shane and our waitress were amazing. The meals came out with the appetizers which resulted in cold food - our waitress right away went to reorder our meals and the manager came and apologized and offered to pay for our meals. Now that is great customer service!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
5,Sue H.,"Morrisonville, NY",25,33,1.0,5.0,2016-11-05,I met some friends for lunch yesterday at Applebees! I have not been there is a long time !

1,Jacynthe S.,"Laval, Canada",117,105,733.0,4.0,2016-12-01,This was my first time ever and I loves it but the menu is so big that I will have to go back a few times to try more of the menu items. They have great specials like now I have 2 for 20$ so you can have either 2 salads or an appetizer to share (4 or 5 to choose from) 2 entrees (4 or 5 to choose from) you also have the same deal but for 25$ with different entrée options. The service was fast but not super friendly and the waitress looked rush when she answered my question even though the place was pretty empty.  I had the boneless bite for appetizer and they were ok but had better. I took the fiesta chicken and even if the mexicain rice was not good at all the chicken was nice and juicy so its all good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
0,Just M.,"Troy, NY",0,18,10.0,4.0,2017-01-15,"I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality considering this is a chain restaurant. The chicken tortilla soup was so fresh, flavorful and spicy. It tasted home made in a nicely spiced brothy base with generous chunks of tender chicken topped with just the right amount of super thin crispy tortilla strips. I'm super picky about soup and this passed the test! I also ordered a classic cheeseburger.  It  came with the basic LTO along with a few thin slices of pickles and a side of fries.I substituted onion rings for the fries.  The missing star is because the onion rings were not to my liking. They were not battered but had a hard crispy breadcrumb coating. Also, medium is the least rare they will cook a burger. I ordered it as rare as they would cook it but it came out fully cooked with no trace of pink. However, their saving grace is that the beef was still juicy and it was perfectly seasoned. Everyone else enjoyed their food. Items ordered were clam chowder, fish and chips,  pasta Alfredo, spicy chicken  and shrimp and a few desserts. The service was friendly, attentive and professional.  This location is now one of my favorite chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
2,Tim R.,"Boston, MA",12,42,14.0,1.0,2017-04-20,"Got blasted drunk here the other night when the bartender kept encouraging my consumption, soon the employees drew on my face. Not only that, they embarrassed me in front of my cousin when they began to force feed me mozzarella sticks... not cool. Then they overcharged me and proceeded to violently throw me out. My cousin was mortified and the injuries both he and I sustained are being reviewed by our lawyers respectively.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plattsburgh-3,,,,,
