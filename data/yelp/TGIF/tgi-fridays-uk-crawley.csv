Bruce A.,"Corona, CA",22,51,26,4.0,12/10/2017,"This is the 2nd or 3rd time to this location. When I travel to the UK, it's nice to find a familiar spot. The menu has some different items which are not in the USA Fridays restaurants. Still, always a good choice, even on a Sunday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-crawley
Elle B.,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",1,20,4,4.0,1/15/2017,"I love TGIs! Come here when we go to evening cinema showings. Staff are very friendly.  One of my favourites to get is the Jack Daniel's burger, and if you're hungry upgrade to the Jack Daniel's loaded Chilli cheese fries they are amazing!  Unfortunately they don't serve any alcohol free beers which I find surprising, but I tried their Raspberry mock tail and it was delicious (similar to Wetherspoon's raspberry mojito but without alcohol).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-crawley
