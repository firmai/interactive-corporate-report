35,Anne Marie R.,"Tomball, TX",16,23,14.0,3.0,2015-07-12,"I guess I should start by saying that we had just been to a red robin earlier in the week ( maybe two or more years was the previous visit) and that visit left me saddened at how poor quality and cheap tasting this place has become over the last few years. Something has gone wrong over the years! RR used to be really good!  So coming to the soft opening already had points against it but willing to give it a shot. Especially as it was FREE which we totally appreciate. The greeters at the door were over the top funny friendly people, almost good enough to have been hired just for this opening-- seemed staged but either way it was cool. The place is much larger than youwould think once inside. Ordered what they called a pear-tini which was magenta purple and had half a rim of pretzel sized salt on it... gag! It had tequila in it but it was not a margarita...the salt on this was just terrible. Suggested that they use sugar instead and guy (possibly bartender?)told me they cant change the recipe... mmmkk?!?!  Since i normally would have a burger and was already opinionated i decided to go for a different item- Had the bonsai salad- honestly it was really disappointing. Bland iceberg lettuce with old  looking veggies and carrot strings. Dressing was in a shotglass sized cup. The chicken was nothing special. Hey, I totally understand that this is not a 4 - 5 star type place but geeze corporate - hire some people who love cooking food and taste things before they come out, and care what things look like before served. I think for a soft opening everyone did well and were very nice and attentive but I probably wont be returning just cuz I really just think the food is not that good. Again, thank you for providing our famlily dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spring?start=20,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

60,Kevin L.,"Spring, TX",4,4,,1.0,2015-07-29,"My girlfriend and I came in there on 7/24/15 and Rachael served us, and it was extremely the most horrible service I've had in my life. My girlfriend and I know how customer service should be, to the fact I am a manager, and she's a lead server. It all started with her extremely rude attitude, she was helping the table next to where we were being seated at, when she quickly finish up helping that table and ran to our table to yell at the host, ""why did you seat another table in my section."" She later came back to take our drink orders, where we ordered a peach tea, and a regular sweet tea. Not knowing that the store only had regular ice tea, which came with sugar packets, that is what she brought out. Usually for my restaurant that I manage, I make sure that all of my servers tell the customer before hand that if they order sweet tea, they would have to mix it would sugar packets.  We than asked for an exchange to just get water instead, by the time she brought the water out, she slammed it onto the table not even bothering saying a word or looking at the table. We thought it would be a one time thing, but instead she did it once more when she brought out the tray of utensils. When she ran the food out, she slammed a hot plate onto the table, and didn't say anything. We felt if she was being prejudice because of being a different race than her, because the couple in the booth next to us, were the same race but she had an excellent attitude, always coming to check on them and having a smile on her face, but when she walked by our table it was always an evil glare on her face. When the check was brought out, the sweet tea that we did not even touch and returned was not taken off the bill. The only plus side to the whole dining experience was being able to talk to the manager and hostess that actually showed that they care. I know it is still a new location and kinks are still being worked out but that was absolutely the most unpleasant dining experience I've had ever encountered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spring?start=60,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

I flagged down the manager and she sent us a waitress. The waitress was super sweet and the manager came back to apologize and offer to give us appetizers. I said its ok dont worry about it. We ordered our meals, two adult and a kid's meal. Our meals came but kid's meal didn't. We ordered our burger and asked for medium with an over medium egg on top. Everything came out super well done. We ate while our nephew kept telling us how hungry he was so we gave him our fries. We asked the waitress and she said it's  coming. We were almost done with our meal when the kid's meal came out. By this time, our bottomless fries had hit bottom. The waitress asked if we wanted more, we said yes, it never came. Another waiter passed our table and asked if everything was ok and we told him what happened. I guess he told the manager and she came over and said ""i took two burgers off your check because you had to wait 15mins"". Excuse me? Seriously?! I told her the rest of my disatifaction but she didn't seem to care. The waitress came back with a $0 check and ask if we want to keep it. No apologies and she STILL didn't refill my fries. So much for bottomless fries! We left a $10 tip on the table and left. I'm not sure what's the deal. Did we come on a wrong day? Is this racism because we're Asain? Is this a Texas thing?

The TV's in the FAMILY eating area were showing UFC.  I feel this is VERY inappropriate television for children to be watching, and isn't appropriate to be shown in a family environment with many young children in the dining area.    At one point, there were 2 bloody faces being shown and close ups of punching and kicking in the face.  If I ever return, I'll make sure and leave my family and kiddos at home, since to me, this isn't something they need to be exposed to.  It wasn't just one small TV, it was every large screen TV in the family dining area.  Very disappointed in this decision made by Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spring?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,1.736,2.92

Well, really don't know if he is the manager or owner, but he was great.   When we were getting ready to leave, He came by to ask if everything was to our liking.  We told him we were pleased with everything, but my husband mentioned he was a little disappointed that fried pickles were no longer on their menu.  He said he had some in the back and offered to make them for us. As we were full we said thank you but not at this time.  When we left he was waiting for us with an order of fried pickles to go at no charge.   We were both impressed with him for doing this, which proves he is very customer service oriented   Which is hard to find these days   I sincerely hope this restaurant is successful.

5,Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699.0,3.0,2017-03-21,"You know how I am behind chain restaurants!  I will admit that my server was extremely attentive.  I'm a huge fan of them having their own seasoning salt at the table because that means you have a possibility of actually having flavored food! I'm also a fan of having many unlimited options.  That includes some fruit, salad and even the fries. Most cool was the unlimited root beer floats! Fries come in a few flavors and you can get premium sauces for dipping.  I opted to get garlic fries with a side of beer cheese, buzzard sauce and sweet pepper Thai sauce. For the main edible, I opted for the A.1. Peppercorn burger. This gourmet burger has hardwood-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A.1. Peppercorn Spread, tomatoes and crispy onion straws on a onion bun. My date ordered garlic fries and the Royal Red Robin burger. That is a burger with cheese of your choice melted on it, tomatoes, lettuce,  mayo, bacon and an egg up top.  All in all, the burgers are smaller than what I would expect for $10 or more burgers. In regards of taste, the burgers did have character, but they did not knock my socks off. Having unlimited options will ensure you leave full though. The beer cheese sauce definitely have a taste of beer to it. For this non drinker, I will pass on it next time.  The menu truly is extensive. You can get salmon, burgers, chicken, under 600 calorie meals, etcetera. Many people are coming in to try macaroni and cheese burgers that are new here. Come find something to eat here.

4,Jane I.,"The Woodlands, TX",349,352,826.0,3.0,2017-03-27,"On a weekend evening, we were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated in a roomy dining room within seconds. Our server was on hand within minutes to take our orders and niftily punch them into our table's computer tablet so that the kitchen would start preparations immediately. This mini kiosk can apparently play games for a nominal charge in case young diners (or bored dates) need something to pass the time.  Because our food appeared at our table rather rapidly, we didn't get a chance to play. We ordered the Sriracha shrimp appetizer to start (which is apparently a 'limited-time only' item). While it seemed like a misnomer for something that tasted nothing like Sriracha, we had few complaints. The cornmeal-dusted shrimp were freshly fried and nicely paired with the handmade chips underneath but for $7, it seemed like a pretty paltry serving size. I was happy to see a Garden burger on the menu for vegetarians (with Boca burgers available for vegans) and found it to be just fine. Each burger order comes with a choice of sides, many of which are 'bottomless' and can technically be refilled as many times as you wish. I asked for fries, which turned out to be of the steak variety. Warm and crunchy, the fries were largely inoffensive but far from spectacular. I was also surprised at how few came with the meal; however, my two subsequent requests for refills were completed amicably and without delay.  While I found the whole meal to be far from outstanding, the service was fantastic. Our server checked on us several times throughout the meal to clear plates or to deliver refills of food and drink. Even the manager dropped by to make sure everything was going well with our meals. When we were ready to go, there was no need to wait for a check. The aforementioned tablet on the table allowed us to see the total, calculate a tip, pay with a card, and even print a receipt - easiest checkout ever (diners paying with cash would still need to go through their servers). I would recommend Red Robin for a quick meal that hovers just a shade above fast food.

I swear this burger was in the same class as Burger King!  It had a previously frozen thin tasteless meat patty with tons of mayo and shredded lettuce and a pickle slice with two paper thin strips of bacon that were laid in a X on the tasteless patty.  The bottomless steak fries were your normal Walmart generic brand fries with no salt or seasoning that was noticeable and there were about 10 fries on my plate. After eating what I could.. yes I ate it, I was hungry!  I paid my $11.40 for this less than mediocre meal (not including $6.80 for 22oz beer). I liked the beer it had taste!

I really enjoyed the Buzz Mac and cheese tavern. Fries were meh. They weren't special. Needs more seasoning overall and definitely more salt! I am disappointed that the fries aren't good at a restaurant that advertises ""bottomless fries"".  Price: Outrageous. Some burgers on the menu were listed in the $15+ range. That is too fancy for a place like Red Robin. I'm glad I opted for an average priced one ($10) because it was just as good. I think they're overpriced in general.
