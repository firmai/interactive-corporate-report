If you looking for chain bar food, good drinks and music (on a Friday) .... without having to drive to D.C., this is a great spot.

Dalton G.,"Utica, NY",2,16,2,1.0,1/14/2018,"This location should be shut down. From the other reviews I see here, it is evident why, but I'll add my experience in a quick, easy to read format. Before I do I'll preface with I used to come here a lot and enjoy it.  - The bar smelled like a dirty used urinal. Everyone, including the staff was complaining.  - My beer had sediment floating in it. Did not taste great.  - Chicken was rubber. Albeit it did have some flavor.  - I feel bad for employees who have to work here.  At the Fridays in Tyson I had an experience that I won't go into detail about because management corrected it. This location is unsalvageable. That smell was GROSS! Go to the Springfield location. It's your only hope!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12
Yannick T.,"Alexandria, VA",78,12,9,2.0,11/4/2017,"It mildly pains me to give this FRIDAY's a less than decent review because I've been a customer here on and off for over 10 Years. On any other occasion I'd give this location 3-Stars because it's rather consistent with what you'd expect from most chain restaurants: 1.) Consistent Food Quality. - 1a.) Consistent Price. - 1b.) Decent Service. Well the last was non existent; not by everyone...just one bartender (who I won't bother naming). Having not been to this Friday's in quite some time, I wasn't up to date on their menu nor happy hour specials. As soon as we sat down the bartender asked us if he could start us with ""a long island, margarita."" From the beer tap right in front of me...I did the math and figured they had to have more adult beverage offerings. Call me crazy...but I felt it in my guts.  I asked what the happy hour specials were...and with a straight face he said ""Long Island, margarita."" As a world class A-hole...I typically enjoy other world class A's...I truly do. I didn't enjoy this one. And with that interaction, within 3 minutes of sitting at the bar, we were both quickly soured and the bartender made no efforts at customer service. We weren't asked if we'd like menus. When we received our one menu, it was missing pages. Frustrated I had to ask another bartender for the happy hour specials and a new menu.  Once our drinks came (Long Island for me, Lemon Drop Martini for my lady), my lady asked: ""Taste this. Is it missing something."" ""Yeah. Alcohol."" ...from there the food was as expected, and the service on par with not that that great...including long wait periods and no checking how our food drinks were. It was highly disappointing overall.  Here's a bit of advice: if you're not feeling the vibe of your server or bartender, trust me, ask for another one or move to another side of the bar. Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12
Nicole S.,"Washington, DC",118,62,61,1.0,9/14/2017,"THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Came here for happy hour with my coworkers. Upon entering, we waiting about 5 minutes to be seated. The hostess did not even bother to ask how many will be with our party. My coworker asked her if we'll still be able to get the 1/2 off appetizer deal if we sit in the dining area versus the bar and the hostess said yes. We were seated for about 15 minutes and no one had come to our table to get us drinks or take our orders. My coworker flagged down the hostess and asked if she was our server, the hostess said no and walked away.. did not even say ""I can find your server for you."" 5 minutes passed and there was someone bussing the table behind us so I asked him if he was our server. He responded with ""I've been here since 7am and I am about to get off."" Again, did not even try to help us get a server. Another 5 minutes passed and the same server finally came to our table and said ""looks like you're stuck with me, I'll be your server."" Obviously they overwork their servers and this bad energy is transferred onto the customers.  We asked him if we'll be able to get the 1/2 off appetizer deal like the hostess said and he told us that it does not apply to the dining area. We were very disappointed because the main reason we went to TGI Friday's was for that deal and if we had known from the beginning, then we would've sat in the bar area. But the hostess did not bother telling us the correct information.  We tried to flag down one of the managers to share the horrible experience we have had so far. He told us he couldn't do anything about it and made us feel like it was wrong to even share how we felt about our experience with him. I told him that this will be going on the Yelp review and this is the point where it gets really weird.. he asked for my ID because he said that I don't look old enough to be drinking an alcoholic beverage. I told him that the server already checked our IDs when we ordered our drinks. The manager demanded to see it and pulled the ""I'm the manager, I can do whatever"" card.. I showed him my ID since I had nothing to hide. This is when he said ""okay so if I see a bad review under your name, I will come find you"" I told him ""okay unless you have a photographic memory and memorized my address in the two seconds you saw my ID, then sure"" he again stated ""I will find you if I see a bad review."" My coworkers and I started getting very creeped out and politely asked him to let us continue with our dinner. He continued to hover and make things even more awkward. It was the worst experience I had ever had anywhere and unless you want to get threatened then DO NOT COME TO THIS TGI FRIDAYS!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12

She didn't serve our appetizers together, and it take 10 mins between each appetizer (4 total). She was very disrespectful, slamming dishes on table, and then putting her hand out to make us wait when we needed something. Other 3 tables she was serving had issues as well. They were upset. She didn't give us utensils after our food came and then she didn't give us the right amount of utensils when she did. She also kept bumping my arm with dishes and didn't say excuse me.

Dirpysquid 4.,"Alexandria West, Alexandria, VA",0,3,,2.0,12/31/2017,"This restaurant was not really my type of place, My seat wasn't really giving us any privacy, the booths are to small, and they use glass to separate us from the people next to us, then there was the service, the waiters were very pushy and kept asking us if we wanted to order anything else, even after we said no, twice. (If we want to order anything then we will ask them). Although this might be because it's New Year's Day. I don't take that as an excuse, and they need to be consistent with their service. The food on the other hand was good. Depending on your choice although an the other hand some foods might not be as good, depending on my opinion. Overall the restaurant gets two stars not because of the food, but because of what many other restaurants get rated on, it was the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12

Stacey W.,"Alexandria, VA",52,147,783,3.0,6/1/2017,"I like what I call ""Club Fridays"" at TGIFridays! I used to go to TGIF all the time when I was in high school and college. Then it was once every couple of years. But now with ""Club Fridays"" I probably will go more often. The first time I experienced ""Club Fridays"" was years ago when I met a friend for an impromptu meeting in Laurel. About two hours in, a DJ set up by the bar and it turned almost into a club before my very eyes. I could not believe it!  The bar area was packed, the music was loud, and people were having a goooood time. I thought it was just that location until last night. I went to a Fridays on King St. to meet up with folks. We ate, we chatted....and again after a couple of hours....we saw the DJ set up and the bartenders were busy. Add to that the game was on.....packed! So ""Club Fridays"" is a thing now! Oh and the $10 app deal is good. Order any of the ones listed and you can reorder the same item or a different one.....still pay just $10 total! Wish there was one healthy/healthier option included (like a garden salad...use iceberg if you have to but include something naturally green). Service is slow (they need to hire someone to bus tables). They won't take your plate until you leave so order away but your table will be filled with plates. If you are looking for a spot to chill at night, check out TGIFridays. At least on Thursday nights. Parking is free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12

They always have drinks specials and depending on which side of the bar you sit on, you may not be able to get back up, lol.

William M.,"Miami, FL",39,74,,1.0,7/20/2017,"I arrived with a group of 5 people at this location late Thursday night last week, greeted by the unwelcoming hostess at the entrance who could barely speak any English. We chose this specific location because of the late open hours it offered.  Upon arrival at this time of the night, this TGI Friday's seemed more of a biker bar with over 50 motorcycles parked out front where all the bartenders and waitresses focused on the bikers at the bar, and didn't attend to the rest of the customers on the restaurant floor.  We were told by her that they were packed and no tables were available for the size of our group when there was clearly multiple open tables around the restaurant. The hostess seemed unwilling to be proactive to arrange together two tables for us and seemed like as it we were an inconvenience to her. We were literally about to walk out after waiting almost 30 minutes to be seated when we could see more than 10 tables open around the restaurant. We were customers arriving, willing to spend money on your establishment hence I shouldn't have to beg for a seat.  There were no managers in sight, and only one(1) waitress for the entire restaurant. The service was so horrendous that even at the time to pay the bill we literally had to all go to the front hostess because our waitress was nowhere to be found.This was completely unsatisfactory, the food was excellent which is the bare minimum a restaurant must offer.

Garrett S.,"Alexandria, VA",36,5,,1.0,2/20/2017,"Terrible management. My wife worked today one of the employee stole $50.00 out of her bag, they saw who did it and they did nothing to that employee. They are now accuse my wife of being late for 2 hours because she did not have money for the bus because that employee stole the money. Her manager had a disrespect for myself and my wife when handling the situation. After the situation above happened, I will put the truth to the quality of the food being served. Normally I would never admit this stuff but you don't allow theft and then disrespect that victim and her family. So here are the truth about this store. My wife who works there said that the shrimp was dropped on the floor and afterwards she observed the cook put it in oil and served it to the customer. Another employee was upset at a customer so she dragged a lemon across the table, mashed it all over the wall and then served it to a customer. She states that the kitchen is dirty and its not properly cleaned with the tools being served. To clean the dishes because the dishwasher is sorta broken they will just use a napkin to remove dirt and grease to make it look as if its the appearance its clean.

Then when the food was ready then had no plates or serving utensils for the salad platter, wings , skins, and brownies. They said they had nothing so I asked for take out containers which they gave me the very small ones. They gave me plastic forks and napkins but no plates.

First time I've ever had two things happen, one is a small amount of chopped up bacon on my Jack Daniels burger. It's always been slices all over the county. Maybe they are running low on bacon and by dicing up a slice it looks like more?? Not sure the reason behind this. Secondly I was in my second Stella and not even done with my burger and the waitress (Terra) brings the check to the table and says ""when your ready""?? What?? Are you ready for me to go so hopefully you can get a larger group at this table and make more tips?? I am not ready to go and would have ordered another beer or two.

Cole G.,"Alexandria, VA",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2016,"This review is based on 7 years working at this store, I have eaten here literally hundreds of times. Food is standard fridays fare (almost all of which arrives frozen on a truck, and almost nothing is made in the store) food is extremely inconsistent, ranging from properly cooked to inedibly overcooked, depending on who is working that day. Kitchen also has had an ongoing pest problem for the last 7+ years, mice and roaches, management turns over to frequently to actually fix the problem.Service is also highly inconsistent and due to the nature of the job, the turnover rate is extremely high, meaning you will most likely be served by someone who has been there a few months and will likely be gone in a few more and thus has little knowledge of the  operation.  In my opinion the only reason to visit would be to see Wagner, the head bartender who has been working there for over 32 years and is very knowledgeable, but I still can't give it more than 1 star.

My cousin had a $11 sangria abs she said it was delicious not sure what kind. It was orange and looked tropical. Our waiter was not personable and seemed a bit timid and shy.

Danielle D.,"Washington, DC",23,33,2,1.0,12/7/2014,"Went to visit this Fridays for the first time after recently moving to the Alexandria area. My family was in town from NY on their first night and we wanted to get out after a long day of shopping for a quick bite to eat. I was sorely mistaken. We walked in on a Saturday afternoon around 4p.m, which is a decent time considering how busy Saturday evenings can be. But again, this is Fridays; not really a popular spot to dine these days. So when I walked in  I was shocked that there was a 15-20 min wait. I am a pretty patient person but my one year old niece, is not. My sister and I did the best we could to keep her entertained as much as one can with a baby in a public place and after 30 minutes, I was getting upset. Again, the place was pretty slow so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and suspected that they were short on staff at the moment.  After about 40 minutes, everyone who walked in before and after me were either seated or had left the building. So I walked up to the hostess who was flirting with another employee and asked can I be seated. She asked for my name again and said ""OH! I'm sorry we gave your seat away, your next!""  Unbelievable to say the least. I looked at her and told her to take my name off the list and left. I will not be back and would not recommend this place to anyone. And judging by the reviews I am not alone on that notion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=60
Charity B.,"Arlington, VA",25,125,,1.0,10/14/2014,"I am done with Fridays.  Now, first off, it's TGI Friday's.  I know not to expect too much.  But my last visit here has made me decide, never again. I have been coming to this Fridays on/off for a few years.  Usually for take-out food.  This past weekend, no one could decide what to get for dinner, it was getting late and I did not feel like cooking.  So we ordered from Fridays, like I've done numerous times in the past.  I get into my car, drive there, navigate their terribly awkward parking lot and go inside.  We're told that the food isn't quite ready.  No big deal.  So we sit and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.   As I am sitting there, getting increasingly angry, not one employee stopped to apologize, ask if we were ok, nothing.  The restaurant was no where near as busy as I've seen it on other occasions.  Finally, the food is ready.  The guy at the take-out window explained that the kitchen was backed up and they just made our order.  Ok.  Fine.  Piping hot fresh food is worth the wait.  Nope. When we get home to eat the food (3 minute drive away), we see that most of the food is ice cold.  The mashed potatoes are hard lumps, chicken dry as a bone and cracking on the outside, the ""sizzling"" cheese was congealed into a hard lump coating the bottom of the container and cold, un-cooked french fries.  The best thing was my son's burger, which we all stared longingly at while he ate it.  I've never wanted to take food from my child's mouth before in my life, but man, was I tempted. I can look past all the other problems that I've had with Fridays.  But this last visit was just too much.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=60

Lexi N.,"Bowie, MD",58,2,,1.0,7/17/2016,"My bf and I stopped here for a quick bite while we were in the area for the weekend. We figured it was something we knew, we enjoyed, and that we had coupons for so it was definitely a go. Upon arrival, we stood at the front for about 8 mins until the host arrived. When he finally came up front, he bundled together crumbled sheets of paper into his arms from all over the host desk, then said that there would be a 15 min wait & asked for our names. We gave him our name & he scribbled the name down on one of the disheveled papers in his arms. 15 mins later, he took us to our table. But the worst was yet to come at this point. Throughout the night, the series of crappy events continued. First, our waitress took forever to come to the table. She was clearly irritated with the other staff. No warm or fuzziness at all. She took our app order & food order at the same time, which was as we wanted it, then disappeared into the kitchen to place the order. 20 mins later a different waitress arrives with food for our table that we did not order. We explained that it wasn't ours & she apologized then walked to another table, then walked back to the kitchen, as if she had no idea where she was supposed to be going. 20 mins later, the same thing happened with another order & a different waitress. When we explained this wasn't our order, she asked another waiter about the table numbers where he replied ""I don't know"" & they continued to have their (clearly agitated) conversation right in front of our table, expressing their frustrations. Not professional at all. But it's not over. This happened ONE MORE TIME following the arrival of our appetizer. A waitress came with the wrong food as our waitress came with our correct food. As she was placing our food on our table, she and the befuddled waitress with the wrong food engaged in an argument about how this wasn't the table number she was looking for. During their argument, another gentlemen showed up at our table with a blue motorcycle drink & placed it in front of my bf......who does not drink liquor...... Our waitress snatched it from the gentleman's hand & proceeded to walk it to another table she was working. By that time, my bf & I had asked for boxes & we're ready to head out. We'd had enough of this hell hole. But I decided to take one bite from my pasta ..... Which was delicious, but a freaking inferno. I mean PIPING hot, as if they put it in the microwave. My tongue is still burnt. By that point, we had had it with this circus. As we exited, I vowed to write a Yelp review, something I had never done before but loved reading. Anddddd here I am.  The food was delicious as always, but the waitstaff had to be part of an entertainment show hired for the evening. It was so awful, it was borderline funny. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone unless they wanted take out. The only reason I gave it one star was because Yelp is making me play nice.

Mimi N.,"Falls Church, VA",162,16,10,1.0,6/15/2014,"Step dad wanted to come eat here for Father's day. The place wasn't packed at all.

My sister suggested I take a shot every time he comes back to say ""Your order will be out in a few more minutes"". Good thing I didn't play her game.  At first I thought that they were serving the customers at the bar watching the NBA first, but then I overheard our waiter say to one of the hosts that the cooks in the kitchen were so behind on their orders because they were too busy watching the game too.  On top of that, our poor waiter was being bombarded with questions by this other customer who was eating alone about the restaurant not having something that was on the online app. How in the world is the waiter supposed to know anything about that? That guy was clearly complaining to the wrong person, slowing down the service even more. Service, pretty disappointing. The food was pretty basic; such a simple menu. Most of the stuff on there was just chicken and shrimp with some mashed potatoes.. Or steak and some fries.. Or some pasta with some chicken and shrimp. Save your money, and make some instant mashed potatoes, steak, or pasta at home. Might as well, since it tastes the same anyway.

Chris S.,"Alexandria, VA",127,71,27,1.0,3/20/2014,"Like many in the NOVA area, I have frequented TGI Fridays for their cheap and long happy hour and for being a solid last-resort choice when you can't decide where to go with a significant other/group of friends. It's generally the same lackluster result every time at different locations. For this particular location, however, they get the brunt of my disdain. My girlfriend has an odd obsession with Fridays. Her usually sound logic and reasoning skills tend to be thrown to four winds when she is under the unnatural red and white glow of their store sign.  With my prior bad experiences at other locations, I'm generally reluctant to go. Every now and again, in order to stay in her good graces on that particular day, I will tag along.  In the past three months I think she has dragged me to this location four times. Out of these four times, I think we've eaten a meal a total of once. We were literally pleading for them to take our money and couldn't get any service. None! One of those times, we said we wanted to sit in the bar area (which was full, happy hour) and offered to take a small table in the behind-the-bar section. While reminding the hostess twice, We waited 20 min to get seated. All the while, the table we were eventually sat at was empty the entire time.  It took the server another 10 min to come by. Yeah, we left.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of waits. Now, the icing on the cake was the latest visit here.  On Sunday 3-16-14, the odd itch to eat Fridays returned to my life companion. This time, I decided I wouldn't complain (as much as usual at least) my way out if this one. It took a couple minutes to get seated, but the hostess apologized, no biggie. There weren't any Irish beers for St. Paddys in stock even though a sign at the hostess stand said the special was for the whole weekend. Again, not a big deal, I didn't really want to drink anyway. Our waitress was actually friendly and attentive, told us about the special appetizers, and made sure our drinks were full. Hey, this visit has some promise! Aside from my steak feeling a little colder than normal on a med-rare, The food was actually decent and arrived quickly. Then there was the salted caramel cake, oh man was that thing delicious! Sounds like a good visit you say? Why the harsh one star rating? Well, let's fast forward to 3am when I had to visit the bathroom every hour for about 8 straight. It was like a re-creation of the exorcist from my mouth and my butt. Fun times indeed. I knew something was up with the steak because of the temperature, but it wasn't overly bloody nor did it taste bad. I should have went with my instincts on that one. How do I know it was from Fridays? That was literally the only thing I ate differently with a group of four all that day. Everything else was safe home cooked stuff. On the bright side, I'm off the hook from having to deal with TGI's terrible service and mediocre food for at least a year!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=80

Katelyn L.,"Honolulu, HI",56,9,,1.0,2/29/2016,"This was probably the worst Fridays i have ever been too . Im typically not one to leave harsh reviews but this was necessary . Walked in and it being a Sunday night i was not expecting a crowd (it was extremely dead ! Maybe 10 tables with people spread out through the restaurant . I was like no problem cool so we shouldn't have a problem with slow service We had been seated promptly by our hostess & waitress had introduced herself &  took our order & got our drinks she kind of avoided much i contact and looked like she was kind of shy & when we were sat down i saw another couple having a hard time with the food the food they have been served . Me thinking (maybe they are just those kind of cranky food critiquing people ) i got pot stickers to start off and they were great hot & crispy  but what did they throw cabbage & carrots all over the plate maybe asian-esque thing whatever then i had gotten the bbq braised beef tostada i looked at this think and was just sooo confused . Why was there more cabage and carrots everywhere , where was the meat & why does this bbq sauce taste like boiled soy sauce . Literally like holy salt lick . The meat was non-existent kind of like when you put meat in a crockpot for too long and it just shrivels up too nothing . In the end though the service wasnt the problem & exept for taking 30 minutes for the check . Truth is i probably wouldnt come back here .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=80
Michelle W.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,25,8,3.0,3/18/2015,"So we went there for the endless appetizers.  Our server was great We ordered 2 apps one came out first and we were told the other one would be out shortly. Well about 5 mins later I asked the server about my app, he said he had asked the cook to make the app and the response he got was oh ok.   I went to speak to someone about it and came across a table of management. Told them what had happened and that it was ridiculous that a server would be talked to like that. I think it's ridiculous that the server didn't think he could go right to a manager to report the cook.  Then I got a manager squat down next to the table and tell me how sorry he was but made no effort to offer anything, maybe would've been nice for him to tell the server to bring the bill to him so he could make an adjustment, something as simple as taking our 6 dollar dessert. .surprise and delight your guests would be a great policy.

Aggravating and disappointing are probably the most accurate way I could describe both services and products. I ordered a set of appetizers and an entree for several friends. I get a call saying that the potstickers are out. I request an extra portion of one of the other appetizer. The person on the other end says, ""so loaded potatoes""? I'm looking at my order and nowhere did I order this. I reiterate that I don't want anything with cheese so no potatoes. What did I get? Yep. An order of loaded potatoes. To add insult to injury, the order was cold, the chicken was overcooked and burnt, and the potatoes looked like it had been sitting awhile. You know the kind that looks dried and shriveled and unappetizing.  I called grub hub only to be told they can't do anything for a) not getting my order right, and b) getting the food cold. Mind you, it was grub hub that got my order, not TGIF, so there's no excuse that the restaurant got it wrong. It's also not the restaurant's fault that I got it cold.

We have been to this place about 5 or 6 times (we literally live around the corner, so it is convenient for us), and some of our experiences could be 3 and a half stars, and some were definitely one star. The food is very generic, but not too bad. The wings, the ribs and some of the salads are decent. Some mixed drinks are good. But the service can be really horrible. During our last time there, everything that could go wrong with the service did go wrong: slow, wrong dishes, forgotten orders, requests like ""no ice"" ignored and forgotten, etc., etc. So, not a totally awful place, but very inconsistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=120
Danny H.,"Woburn, MA",0,5,,1.0,8/26/2014,"My wife and I stopped in around 6:30 last Saturday, It was not at all crowded so we thought we could go in and eat quickly. When we walked in two woman had their back to us and were leaning on the hostess stand. We finally said excuse me and she did not seem to like us interfering with her conversation. She said are you here for dinner? She assumed we wanted to eat in the lounge area and pointed and said sit anywhere. We told her we wanted to sit more in the dining area and she said ""OK it will be about 20 minutes"" and pointed at the bench for us to wait. We then looked around and noticed that there was hardly any other patrons on the floor. I then asked why we had to wait 20 minutes with their being no other customers. She then said that all the servers were currently on break. After trying to absorb this for a minute, My wife and I verified what we actually had just heard and walked  out and went over to Famous Dave's.

We have been here 3 times and never been impressed with the service; however the food is always yummy.  The first time we went, the waiter somehow lost our credit card, and it got stolen right from under our noses. He was very apologetic and the manager came over to our table and apologized and said he would take care of our ticket, as he should have, but again the food was awesome; however every time we have been here the women's bathroom has been nasty.  Another time we went, we were seated and it took forever for our server to come over and take drink order, then it took another 30 min to get him to come back to place order, then it took about an hour from him to bring our order, only to have given it to the table behind us ""hello wrong table, that's my steamed broccoli"" lol we decided to just leave and let the other table have our order, then we mentioned to hostess on our way out of there.

We decided to sit at the bar while we wait to be seated. I don't even know where to start with the bartender. I never caught his name but I don't understand how he's working in the service industry......He didn't smile when he greeted us or at all for that matter the whole visit. He is very unkept and has the longest dirtiest finger nails I've ever seen. I first got a margarita on the rocks with salt. Tasted horrible I don't recommend it too much sweet and sour mix just tasted like juice to me. Next I got the white peach sangria. I was disgusted when he touched all the fruit before putting it in my drink. I payed in cash at the end of the night and the idiot didn't even give me my change back. I had to wait 10 minutes till he came back to the bar. I saw him and the other bartender sitting at a table talking with people.

I don't even know where to begin, but I'll do my best.    ALERT: table next to you asking their waiter why he waited 40 minutes to tell them the kitchen had 86'ed THE RIBS he had ordered means we should have rushed for the emergency exit ASAP. But, what's the worst that could happen to us?    Let's see, 15 minutes to get 2 sodas. Then 45 minutes to get a salad and a burger. Breaking point was the burger came missing the bacon. NOBODY FORGETS MY BACON. Well, that's going overboard, but the manager 'fessed up they ran out of bacon also. Ironically, we had just seen a TGI Fridays commercial for ribs smothered in a bacon sauce before coming to lunch.    The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the manager and the waiter handled the situation the only way they could, by comping our whole meal. They explained it was veterans day and all Vet's meals were free. So they were flying thru food extremely fast.

We were looking thru the Entertainment coupon book (yes they still make those) to see what we had a coupon for in the area. I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to take a chance. We didn't wait long once we were seated and our waitress was attentive for the most part. She was a little spacey but she had a pleasant attitude. My mom and I ordered the shakers off of the drink menu. I had the berry mojito and she had a mango something. We both agreed they were really good but probably only had a splash of liquor in them. We both ordered the jack daniels burger which was DEEELISH. However, our fries were meh. I don't know what it is with me and sweet potato fries but when will restaurants learn that when they aren't cooked properly they taste like the freezer?? OMG! My mom asked for more fries because hers weren't cooked all the way either (she had regular french fries). That was the only downside to our dinner. The atmosphere was very loud and that was probably only because there were several basketball games on the tv.

In this case it was that bad. I have been to several other fridays locations that i like. I figured this one couldn't be any different and I was wrong. To start off the hostess was running around franticly on a what looked like a very slow wednesday. she sat us at small table smushed up on another group of people eating when clearly there were far better suited areas to be placed. Our table was stickier than the second floor of mister days in clarendon. We were greeted by a very not friendly face asking us what we wanted to drink no greeting at all. for the better part of our visit she made us feel as if asking for anything was a burden. It took 10 mins to get our drinks which were a non sweet tea and a water. The food was as usual to what you get at other locations, what turned to disgust for me was the plate being thrown on the table and her just walking away. This is the service i expect from a McDonalds not a from a company that just spent millions to re brans their look and name when they should have rebranded the staffs training. Seeing sour faces the second you walk in will only ruin your experience.

Asked for sauces and they were never brought. And just because one of my guests had an out of state licence they could not get served alcohol (totally ridiculous).

When the hostess sat us down, the table was obviously not cleaned well, but she decided to cover the stuck-on sauce with the menus. I asked her for a cloth so I could clean the table... she wasn't happy about it. So our waitress came and took our orders. My boys ordered appetizers that included mozzarella sticks. When they started eating, ALL of the sticks were hollow. No cheese inside. I'm sure the cheese just escaped during cooking. But did they put all the hollow ones aside and just try to give it to some suckers? We asked a random worker to speak to the manager. Our waitress came back and said, ""I can take care of it for you. You didn't have to call the manager."" I so did not like that comment. I know she didn't cook the food. If a customer asks for the manager, get the manager. They did end up giving us an order of mozzarella sticks, but the new order was short 2 sticks. The waitress brought out the 2 sticks and all of them were filled with cheese. Problem corrected.

Ron H.,"Woodbridge, VA",165,237,1035,3.0,7/22/2012,"This is one of the oldest Fridays in Northern Virginia.  It is the first one I ever visited back in the 1980s when I was a teenager growing up in Alexandria.  The location is kind of crazy because it sits at the corner of one of the scariest intersections around and half the parking is located in the garage of an office complex. The food is TGIF Americana - family dining with Applebees, Chilis, Ruby Tuesday type stuff but for about a third more the price.  In my opinion the drinks and bar scene is the best part of Fridays.  It's usually a very friendly place and typically provides for a decent meet market for singles in a casual setting. This was the first time I have been to this restaurant in years (I was treating my Mom to a birthday lunch with family), and I must say that they have kept the place looking new and very clean.  The tables and restrooms were crystal clean. The service was great - we were seated to our preference and served promptly.  There was a couple of greeters who came to our table to enquire whether we were being taken care of and the food was great for everybody - but not worth the price.  Of the other casual American chains, I think Friday's must be the most expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=100

I have no idea what flights of fancy occur at bars in chain restaurant on weekday evenings, but shamrocks and leprechauns aren't part of my imagined mise en scene. However, as I had neglected to wear any grass-hued articles proclaiming my love of all things Irish, I was grateful for the chance to sport something green and avoid the pinching that would certainly ensue when I met my party. Imagine, then, my disappointment at discovering it was all a sham. After scores of pinching fingers finished perpetrating their nefarious deeds, I sat at a large table with my party and ordered a rum and coke from our server, from whom curls of steam were slowly rising, such was his frustration at working on a holiday. My drink arrived the color of straw, not so much potent as vitriolic, the rum a liquid splash of fermented sugar cane vengeful to those that had abused its delicate reeds.  The appetizers for the table, including mozzarella sticks, sesame chicken bites, an Italian quesadilla with sausage and chicken, and cheddar sliders with a cloying barbecue sauce, were saturated with sugar and sodium, and were even trashier than I remember Friday's food being (from my underage days). I believe the sliders were a mixture of beef and pork, such was their lard quotient. At least the food was served at reasonably paced intervals. As Michael Jackson began blasting from the speakers, I pleaded with my party to uproot and venture elsewhere.

However, after thinking it through I had to add a star back in because their JD burgers are satisfying in a way no other burger can be for me. Yes, parking sucks. Yes, they get extremely busy on weekends. Yes, on occasion it seems like my food is taking forever. And yes, my one Jack Daniels burger has (if I remember correctly) over 1500 calories in it. But no, I don't care. We don't go to Friday's for a healthy meal.  We go pretty much just for the JD burger, sweet potato fries, happy hour beer (strawberry lemonade slush for me), and fried apps with tons of grease. In one meal here I can consume my entire days worth of calories, which I know is horrible. So, we usually cut the burgers in half and take home half the meal for lunch the following day. You know, so we clog our arteries slowly over time. Just remember when you come here that you aren't going to get a five star meal.

Stefany E.,"Centreville, VA",0,4,2,1.0,1/26/2014,"The worst experience I EVER had in a restaurant. I am a regular at the TGI Fridays in Fair Lakes and thought that this place was going to be the same or close to the same. I do not even know where to start. After a long day of working at DC as servers my husband, co-worker, and I decided to go here as it was on our way to where we needed to go. BIG MISTAKE. We were tired and hungry and we just wanted to sit down, get some beers, get good food, and relax for a bit before going to bed. Instead, we got HORRIBLE service from the restaurant as a whole. It took a long time to get our drinks and food. Then when the food finally came, one of the dishes (a salad) had cheese and we ordered it without it because one of us are cheese intolerant. It took another 10 min to get the salad. Also, my co-worker's dish consisted of rubbery uneatable chicken so we returned it. We did not act like jerks and we were polite and apologized for returning another dish back because we know how the restaurant business works. 1, 2, 5, 20 min passed and no sign of our server nor our food. We ordered at 1:10 am and by now it was 2:00 am. The best part is that we were on our second round of drinks when the security guard came and took our drinks that were practically untouched as we were waiting for the other dish to come so we can all eat together. The manager came and said that they had basically already closed the kitchen and had to start everything and kept saying he had to talk to the server to know what happened. We had also ordered a to go order at 1:10 and apparently the server never put it on the system. Long story short.... My co worker did not get his food nor his to go order for his wife and he was still charged the two beers he drank. As customer service should be, the LEAST the manager could have done is void his 2 beers. We left with the worst experience and my co worker left hungrier than when he came in. Even a McDonald Does better than this place. Save your self a trip and never come to this place. Horrible management and customer service i have had by far, and that is a lot to say as i go out to eat frequently and have been in many different places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
Jennifer G.,"Crofton, MD",38,110,8,3.0,9/22/2008,"R and I stopped by on Sunday since it's right down the road from our apartment and we just wanted something simple and easy for dinner.   The foyer stunk when we walked in.  I have no idea what was causing the smell, but thankfully the odor was gone once you walked into the restaurant.  There was no one at the hostess stand, so we walked up to the bar and grabbed a seat.  It took a couple of minutes before our drink orders were taken.  The bartender informed us of the Happy Hour drink specials, but the beers we wanted weren't included in the HH special, which didn't upset us, but the bartender seemed kinda mad that we weren't getting half price Bud Lights.   The beers were good.  I had a Blue Moon and R had a Stella Artois.  They were cold and delicious.  None of that funky stale beer taste that we've been encountering with draught beers lately.   We ordered our meals next which wound up becoming quite a charade.   First off, my menu was stuck together, which always grosses me out.  I got over it though and decided on the Club Sandwich.  R wanted to try the American Chicken Sandwich, one of the new menu items.  Bartender informed us that they didn't have that, nor did they have the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  So R looked over the menu again and decided to try the Chicken Popper Sandwich (also a new menu item), ""We don't have that"" replied the bartender.  R was starting to get irritated.  For his third choice he wanted the Jack Daniels Burger, ""We don't have that"", the bartender replied again before quickly smiling and saying ""Just kidding!"".  Thank goodness she was kidding!  We also ordered the pot stickers as a starter. The pot stickers are my old standby at Friday's.  They are always good and the dipping sauce is very tasty.  If we had been given plates and not had to both eat off the plate the pot stickers were served on it would have been even better! Our main dishes arrived and neither one of us has any major complaints.  R enjoyed his burger and I enjoyed my club sandwich.  I kinda wish Friday's would go back to serving the club sandwiches on wheat bread like they used to though.  The ciabatta bread just makes the sandwich heavier and harder to get into your mouth, also, they were a little skimpy on the avocado.  I'm probably nitpicking though. A plus was the price, I think it was about $40 for two beers each (not part of the HH special), pot stickers, a burger and sandwich.  Not bad! We might be back.  It's close and inexpensive, but I think it will be a spot we'll only stop by if we're in a pinch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
Jack T.,"Burke, VA",22,19,,4.0,2/15/2012,"My friends and I went to Fridays and Alexandria for our extended lunch on Tuesday, and a good time was had by all!  The service and food were really good, especially considering how crowded the place was.  But the best part of the meal was the Oreo Dessert, with not too many calories and not too sweet- it hit the spot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
Patricia T.,"Oxon Hill, MD",0,8,,1.0,11/8/2013,The worst Chicken picatta I have EVER had. Came b/c menu was supposed to be improved. If it is improved heaven help the old menu. Evening started off bad when waiter insisted on carding us ... Everyone at table could have given him Medicare cards as IDs and with our grey hair we look it. Nothing improved after that. Desert (Tennessee Whiskey Cake) was good... Not exceptional. An experience not to be repeated. Had to give 1 star but in reality should have been minus 5.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
Joe C.,"Alexandria, VA",2,21,,2.0,6/19/2010,"This Fridays seems a bit old and run down, despite the newer Friday's Decor. 1. Great drink specials. $4.00 Long Islands/ $2.00 beers in the bar area, if you can find a table. Table service is bad. One time the manager came out and argued with us about the steak, saying it was in fact medium after he had cut all the way through it and found a sliver of pink remaining.  Maybe it is bad management, staff seems ok.   I think all in all Fridays may have gone downhill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
Maryam F.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,1.0,1/25/2014,"I am normally a huge fan of Friday's. Quick, inexpensive and good food. When my brother and I saw this Friday's we decided to stop because we were both excited to see one, primarily because we hadn't been in a while. We arrived at about 7:45 pm When we arrived the hostesses and host greeted us and then began to whisper amongst themselves.I'm assuming to figure out where to seat us. All three turned their backs to us and then one began to walk away, we asked if we were supposed to be following her. She said yes. Thanks for letting us know. Our server didn't get to us for a few minutes though when she arrived she was pleasant, she had some cool piercings on her chest.We ordered a triple play app. It was good. Our app made it to the table before our drinks. My brother and I both ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp. It was horrible. The chicken was dry, the mashed potatoes were terrible and the shrimp, we refused to even taste. We sent the food back for two sirloin with lobster sauce. We both ordered medium well. Twenty minutes later then came my steak cooked so well done you could barely cut it and my brothers was medium. I asked for a manager and he agreed the steak was overcooked and very dry and took it back to the kitchen. My brother ate his meal and I waited another twenty minutes for my steak, which was returned medium. Still bloody in the center. The manager came by after I had my second try on my second plate. It took him about twenty minutes to check in. I told him the steak was just ok. He said, Great! and then walked away. I surprised to see that I was charged for the meal when the check came. I didn't complain, it was now 10:15 and I just didn't have the energy to discuss why I shouldn't have had to pay for that experience. My waitress apologized alot through the meal. We obviously still tipped her what she deserved but the restaurant will never see us again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
lAy O.,"Falls Church, VA",1,75,2,4.0,11/13/2011,This location has gone back and forth a lot for me.  Some times the food is awful and service is bad.  Last night we went in for the All you can eat wings @ the bar.  April was our waitress and she was great!  The food was exceptional.  My mojito's were well worth the 4 dollar happy hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
Reshawna L.,"Woodbridge, VA",158,67,17,4.0,7/7/2011,"I have always loved the day of the week ""FRIDAY"" and T.G.I. Friday's restaurants. True all restaurants are not the same with the cooks, bartenders, waiters, waitresses but this Friday's is another one of my cheers type places. They have a lot of regulars and it's always and interesting time. They have happy hour too with a few cocktails under $4 and most appetizers are half price. Call location for more details. Most happy hours are from 4 to 7 p.m. though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140

Chyrell B.,"Alexandria, VA",29,24,,2.0,6/9/2009,We were close by and the kids wanted FRIDAYS!!! It was a Saturday around 6pm not busy!!!  We were sat at a table immediately !!! Then waited 20 minutes for the waiter to come my daughter had to go ask the host where our waiter was before one actually came!!! The one thing that bothers me the most is when I'm not greeted by the waiter in at  least 5 minutes especially when they are not busy!!! I love sizzling chicken and shrimp!!! The only thing I order no matter what new things are on there the rest of the meal and service was fine. They also song Happy Birthday to my son!!! The restaurant was also freezing!!! I love Fridays just not this one!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140

Mark W.,"Springfield, VA",8,33,,1.0,9/14/2008,"Called ahead to get a table for a party of 11 - no problem.  We were seated right away and then left alone for 15 minutes.  Finally a waiter came by and took our drink order.  Another 5-10 minutes went by, during which a different waiter came by to ask if we'd been served.   I ordered the sirloin, medium-rare.  I was served a well done steak that had obviously been microwaved.   One of my sons had ordered the sliders with a side salad.  We were told they were coming soon several times, and when we finally sent someone else to get them, it was obvious they'd been sitting under the heat lamp for 15-20 minutes.  The salad was half-cooked from the heat, the cheese on the sliders had melted and run out onto the plate. I've eaten at the Friday's in Springfield several times, and it's always pretty good.   This was AWFUL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-12?start=140
