20,Michael S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",86,2,,3.0,2013-07-15,"My wife and I have been to this location 3 times; two out of those three times we were met with rude staff. Waiters, expos and even one of the managers but they are not all bad. People like Pamela, Dona and Jeff are why we are going to give this place one more shot.  The food is really good it's prepared fast and to the table before you know it. However, the salads are pretty pricey for the portion size and chicken salads only come with 7oz of chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12?start=20,,,,,
22,Jessica H.,"Knoxville, TN",1,11,1.0,1.0,2013-08-16,"My husband and I placed a to go order. I ordered the oriental chicken salad as I always do. The chicken were the most inedible, toughest pieces I've ever had. I had to pick them out just to be able to eat the salad! Ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12?start=20,,,,,
21,Hanna K.,"Knoxville, TN",0,17,,1.0,2014-02-18,"I would give them zero stars if I could. I had a bad experience a few years ago, but I was willing to give them another shot recently. We waited over an hour for our lackluster and flavorless food. Just go across the street to Puleo's Grill. You'll be better off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12?start=20,,,,,
18,John H.,"1, NC",64,30,38.0,5.0,2014-10-26,Great service.  Burning Cajun steak was perfect. Waiter from Penn.  Was funny and engaging.  Kept the whole section fed watered and entertained,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
15,Zhuoying D.,"San Mateo, CA",40,33,80.0,5.0,2015-05-28,"I ordered trio sampler, double crunch chicken with thai peanut sauce, delish, im a chicken lover and a picky eater, so it was good, also the spinach dip is.up to standard too",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
19,Bonny H.,"Knoxville, TN",81,16,,2.0,2015-09-01,"It is with great sadness that i proclaim I have officially fired this restaurant. For many years it was one of my favorite, go to places. I used to love the veggie patch pizza and really can't recall ever disliking anything on the menu. I basically grew up loving this place. Then I started to count calories as many of us do when a life style change is in order and found the most delicious, mouth watering meal, it was the bruchetta sirloin. served with a stuffed mushroom cap and roasted potatoes. It was absolute heaven. Well they discontinued this delightful low calorie fare, I was bitterly disappointed but decided to try another item on the menu that had a reasonable caloric count. It was awful, truly awful. It was a bourbon street chicken and I smothered in in ketchup just to get through it because I was so hungry. After that we didn't go for almost a year. I decided to give them one last chance. We did the curb side to go and I ordered a steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I didn't get my broccoli and the steak was nothing to write home about. I don't like the direction Apple B's is moving and I'm scared for the company's future. As more folks become calorie and health conscious, the 1,200 calorie burger, ""bar food"" and bottomless fries they have been advertising as of late just aren't going to cut it. Bring back the good family restaurant you used to be and serve some delicious healthy choices.  The only reason I'm giving two stars is because when I called to complain about not getting my broccoli the manager was very apologetic and nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
14,Matthew O.,"Knoxville, TN",14,6,1.0,5.0,2015-09-24,This was my first time at Applebee's and it was surprisingly great staff was very friendly. I ordered a sweet tea and it was by far the best sweet tea I've had I also ordered the Swiss mushroom burger with bottomless fries and it was fantastic the burger was juicy and the bun was perfection also the fries was pretty good I really have no complaints I will be back!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
12,Mel B.,"Knoxville, TN",35,113,367.0,4.0,2015-10-18,"Great burgers most of the time (with only a few hiccups here and there). Fries with extra seasoning are great. Husband and brother likes the riblets. Mom loves the Chocolate Lava Cake. I love the Maple Butter Blondie (with extra maple butter sauce). Definitely will return and would highly recommend. Great prices too, and many weekly (lunch) specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
11,Virginia T.,"Bulls Gap, TN",15,64,5.0,2.0,2015-11-14,"This restaurant is the definition of inconsistent. Sometimes the food is good, sometimes it's cold and not good. On our latest trip is was the latter. I truly dislike cold food and there was no excuse. They were not very busy. My husband and I went with the 2 for $20 deal  where you get one appetizer and 2 entrees. We got the exact same things we got the last time we were here. For the app, we choose the mozzarella sticks. They were warm but nothing special. I would have like a hot appetizer, but we ate them. I got the 3 Cheese Chicken Penne pasta. It was on the cold side. The sauce gets a little sticky-gunky when the dish is not hot, so by the time I was about halfway through, it was a bit gross. My husband got the Riblet and Fries basket. They were also on the cold side. We were both very disappointed. Also, my husband made the mistake of joking around a bit with the waiter when we ordered, and he became a little obnoxious, tapping my husband on the shoulder as he passed by and being quite loud. Not the nice, relaxing lunch we had hoped for. Eating here is a total crap shoot. Good luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
17,Sydney S.,"Knoxville, TN",50,4,,1.0,2015-11-28,"I went in to Applebee's at Cedar Bluff, Knoxville around 6:30 tonight and I sat at the bar. The bar was empty for a UT football Saturday. The usual bartender was off and there was a different guy working ""Cory""  I was not impressed with the service, at all!  The bartender kept leaving the bar area, never asked if us if we wanted to order another drink before Happy Hour ended, we had to flag him down to get another drink.  He had no personality what so ever!! Now, I know why the bar was dead.  I love the food at Applebee's, but I will turn and walk out if I see him behind the bar next time!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
16,Margaret E.,"Concord, NC",33,48,6.0,5.0,2015-11-30,"This was the best Applebee's I've ever been to. Our server was DJ. He encouraged us to get out of our comfort zone. We usually get the bacon and honey chicken mac and cheese. With the new menu we opted to try 6 appetizers. We got the fried green beans which were AWESOME, the boneless wings bbq which were good, cheese sticks were good and gooey, steak and chicken quesadillas which were great. Our favorite was the Spicy Chicken Wontons. Not spicy at all but so good. We did dessert as the banana cheesecake and cracker jacks. Our server was DJ and he was FANTASTIC! He had us laughing and every thing. He deserved the tip we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
9,Marko H.,"Knoxville, TN",34,70,17.0,3.0,2016-03-02,"So the ex's bf is in the hospital and I get my daughter in addition to my son for the evening. Guess who doesn't have a proper dinner ready? Yup. Next step, gift card! Applebee's it is. Service - okay, food - adequate, dessert - children devoured it. Basically, it's average food in a contrived neighborhood setting. Nothing bad about it in a pinch but nothing really stood out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
8,Douglas W.,"Knoxville, TN",11,164,118.0,3.0,2016-06-29,"The Applebee's chain was started by Bill and T. J. Palmer who opened their first restaurant, T.J. Applebee's Rx for Edibles & Elixirs, in Decatur, Georgia, on November 19, 1980. After opening their second restaurant the pair sold their company to W. R. Grace and Company in 1983. The Applebee's concept focuses on casual dining, with mainstream American dishes such as salads, shrimp, chicken, pasta, and ""riblets"" (which is considered Applebee's signature dish.) Applebee's is located at the corner of Cedar Bluff and N Peters Rd. Applebee's parking lot is a little cramped and offers curbside pick up. The interior was clean and the staff attentive and friendly. I sat at the bar and order the Quesadillaburger. The burger was good and so was the quesadilla that doubled as the bun. Overall it was a good experience. The burger was cheesy and covered with shredded lettuce. The was a special sauce on it that faintly reminded me of Thousand Island dressing. The clientele at the bar was a little shady but that really isn't Applebee's fault. I might return and try the signature ""Riblete.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
13,Donna C.,"Knoxville, TN",0,5,,1.0,2016-09-11,"Not too good. Steak was grizzly, mac & cheese nothing like the picture, French fries lukewarm, cole slaw room temperature. Server with an attitude. Mark this restaurant off my list, won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
4,Sarah P.,"Knoxville, TN",49,139,29.0,3.0,2017-02-19,"Applebees is Applebees. This location could be better, based on what I have experienced at others. The energy is very low here, the interior is somewhat dingy, and the food is just so mediocre...not that it's necessarily priced as such.  The redeeming factor is the curbside to-go. They're on their game when we order out. The orders are correct and ready at the time estimated. It makes office lunch really easy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
5,Jeff G.,"Knoxville, TN",55,38,49.0,3.0,2017-03-09,"I almost feel like it's unfair to review Applebee's, like playing dodge ball with a fat kid unfair. You would be real hard pressed to eat here, there are more than a dozen other places to eat within a mile all of which would be more preferable. The food isn't good, the service isn't good and I have never felt good after eating there.  You may ask why I give them 3 Stars despite the wording of my review, it's because at the end of the day I don't think their shortcomings are the fault of this location, I blame corporate. You know what you are getting when you eat here, somewhat edible food and watered down tasting beverages even if they aren't watered down. If you ever find yourself drunk to the point of desperately needing food or needing a place to take a Tinder date so you can get to the hooking up afterwards, Applebee's may be your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
10,Anthony T.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",1,2,,1.0,2017-05-05,I've literally been waiting for an order of Chicken Quesadillas for almost an hour.  I'm more interested in seeing how long it will actually take for it to come out of the kitchen at this point.  Basically I'm humoring myself and being reminded of why this restaurant absolutely sucks the big one.  It's been about 15 years since my last visit and will probably never go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
7,Chuck C.,"Knoxville, TN",11,365,,2.0,2017-09-07,The food was just very generic and obviously straight  from the can.  It has great potential to be nice and a destination place if they clean up their act.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
3,Brandon P.,"Maryville, TN",117,39,96.0,4.0,2017-10-21,"The atmosphere here is family friendly even late night.  During$1 margarita time, it is packed! If there is a wait, you'll be better off outside as there ous EXTREMELY limited space in the sitting waiting area.  The servers are very diverse and overall pleasant.  Food was decent (it's Applebees) and did not take too long.  Be very careful when parking, there is a 1 way system with no clear signs indicating this at night. Probably the 2nd best Applebees info the area for sure. Don't expect much and you won't be let down!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
0,Levi S.,"Oak Ridge, TN",6,47,23.0,4.0,2017-11-17,"Stopped by on Friday night around midnight on my way back from Knoxville.  Service was a little slow, but the waiter was friendly.  One of the few places to get a meal at this time of night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
6,Mary F.,"Hillsborough, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2017-11-20,This was awful. I ordered a bloody mary and it was undrinkable how much hot sauce was in it. I asked them to re make it and when I got it back it was sour and fishy. I told the waiter I couldn't drink it and I wanted the check. He said he wouldn't charge me for the re make (not sure why he would in the first place) and then proceeded to tell me the mix was probably made incorrectly and way over a week old! The service was horrid along with the drinks and cold appetizers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
1,Robert B.,"Knoxville, TN",35,79,3.0,2.0,2017-12-05,"Both good and bad.  I'd drink but not eat here. Pros:  We went here because they are having a holiday special, Long Island Iced Tea for $1.  It was OK.  I could almost taste the alcohol.  It was well worth a dollar.  My wife had a $2.49 margarita and it was good.  Nice atmosphere with good service.  Large portions.  Wings are huge. Cons:  The food left a bit to be desired.  I had riblets, large portion size but I found a hair in my ribs.  Kind of ruined my appetite.  I got wings and they were really good and very large.  But, a couple of the drummies were so large they didn't get done all the way to the bone.  OK, so a hair in my ribs and raw chicken, yeah, it spoiled my whole experience.  The cole slaw was icky.  How hard is it to make good cole slaw, after all this is the South, geeze. There are much better places to eat nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
2,Linda K.,"Loudon, TN",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-05,"I now understand why Applebees is in financial trouble!  The all-you-can-eat ribs were like shoe leather.  But that is a personal choice.  THE REAL PROBLEM was the dishes.  The silverware was dirty, the glasses were dirty, the cups were dirty, even the saucer under the cup had jelly on it.  Inside the stainless steel tea pot lid was so greasy dirty it couldn't even be wiped clean.  The order/play/pay screen was so dirty I wouldn't touch it.    Someone standing around out front with a spray bottle and rag didn't offset the filth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-knoxville-12,,,,,
