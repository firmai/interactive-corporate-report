125,Melissa D.,"Sunnyside, WA",1,4,,1.0,2013-01-16,"I should have known from the start that this would be a tale of woe. My husband and I had to run to the Tri-Cities (an hour drive from our home) to run a few errands and as we were semi-kid free decided to go to Red Robin for an early dinner. We arrived and there were endless empty tables (good sign, quick service, right?). After about a 10 minute wait we were taken to our seat and told our server would be right with us. A 10 minutes of seating we had our drinks arrive. First of all, my husband was given a diet soda, not a horrible offense, except that he is allergic to aspartame and it gives him horrific headaches. When we ordered our dinner we ordered a couple of sides for our 18 month old and we asked if we could get them right away (thawed fruit salad and precooked Mac and cheese reheated, not difficult). It was at least 15 minutes before those items arrived. My husband and I continued to wait for our orders of buffalo clucks and fries.    It was eeking ever closer to the 45 minute mark in the restaurant (remember it wasn't that busy) when our order came out. My first bite of chicken was cold like straight out of the refrigerator cold. I stuck my finger in the other pieces and the others were barely warm. My husband's chicken was the same as mine. Add to that approximately 8 stubby, mushy cold fries and that, my friends is when we sent it bak to the kitchen. And then we waited, and waited. Just as we got up to leave the manager brought out our food. Too late, we were on our way out. She offered to box it up for us (not the easiest things to eat in the car and we live about an hour from the Red Robin). She offered to comp us (good) but we only had about $5 worth of stuff. We told her what happened and she said the first round had probably be pre-fired and reheated before sent out (remember they were not busy when we got there). Ewww! She also said when our food was sent back it wasn't red tagged (I assume that means expedited,) so she didn't know there was a problem. She offered to give us a gift card, which she did. We were grumpy, hungry and wasted more than an hour of a limited time we had to go out and spend time together. And, to top it all off, the bite of cold chicken didn't ""sit well"" and I barely made it home. So, all in all, I have a $25 gift card to a restaurant I have no desire to go back to and food poisoning to cap off the night. Thanks Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=120,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.02,3.3200000000000003

I forgot her name, so this will be a general recognition for any woman who works at the Red Robin. Thank you for liking your job. It makes a difference. Now, on to the food. For me, the usual chicken teriyaki sandwich dripping in its own juices. Fries of course. For my co-worker, a healthy less drippy turkey burger. Both were delicious as always. Just don't pay attention to the calories and you'll be fine. Beers were also cold and delicious. Sometimes it worth being a hypocrite, especially when there are steak fries involved.

I've had times where I've had excellent food and service, great food but poor service, mediocre food and good service, and mediocre food and bad service. I guess it depends on who's working. Our server was great today and the food was pretty good, too.  Seems like we took a long break from eating here after our last experience with an older lady server who left us waiting for 15 minutes after we were done eating before bringing our check. Meanwhile, we watched her refilling the straws and going into the back room several times, so she wasn't even waiting on another table. The real kicker was that after she remembered us, she apologized and said she forgot us, but she took another 10 minutes to run our card and bring our receipt. We left SO frustrated.  The lesson to be learned here: be weary of the old lady servers.

114,Jazzy S.,"Kennewick, WA",0,8,,1.0,2013-09-01,"The experience we had in the afternoon of August 29, 2013 was my absolute worst ever experience in this Red Robin. My niece reviewed this earlier about the horrible service we received for a party of 7 with 3 children.  We were ignored when we were seated.  No one came and gave us water or drinks.  We had no silverware. After about 5 minutes or so the waitress finally came by to tell us she would ""be right with us"".  She left and we didn't see her again for another 5 minutes or perhaps longer.  When we came there was just one other couple and our party in this side (the bar side) of the restaurant.  A few minutes later, 6 men were seated and were served drinks and food before we were.  Other people came in and had drinks before us too.  Finally she came and took our drink orders and we asked for the bottomless fries.  She was snarky and pretty much said not a chance. They brought our drink orders and finally took our food orders.  When we finally got our food we asked for condiments and silverware.  The gal said sure but NEVER came back!  We waited at least another 5 minutes before the original waitress came back and we asked again.  I was shocked to see that the condiments and silverware were within a few steps behind the counter! As for the food:  The spaghetti two of the kids ordered had huge bowls of noodles but only a tablespoon or so of sauce, the noodles on the bottom were sticking together and impossible for the child next to me to pry apart - inedible. The vegetables on the hamburgers were wilted and nasty.  My hamburger tasted a little fishy - like they hadn't cleaned the grill in some time.  By the time we finally got the condiments and silverware, all the food was cold or barely warm. My brother-in-law received a different burger than he ordered and he said that was ""gross"".  When the manager came by, I brought up the problems we had to him.  He told me there was nothing he could do about that, and that there was an ongoing battle in the kitchen going on over the fries.  However, I happened to look up and see him yelling at the waitress in full view of the patrons in the other dining room and clearly from my vantage point facing the kitchen.  If that wasn't shocking enough, the poor waitress came back and proceeded to tell us that it wasn't her fault, she was a very good waitress with 20 years of experience and the poor gal began to cry.  The waitress and the manager never apologized, but instead pointed fingers at everyone else.  Whatever the overall problem is, it simply isn't worth it to go there and spend good money for food that is far worse and slower than anything I can prepare at home",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=100,3.2,3.2,3.2,1.924,3.2000000000000006

116,David H.,"Hermiston, OR",2,16,1.0,3.0,2014-01-04,"I enjoy red robin, good food and nice atmosphere. This location is hit and miss though. Went there about 9 on a weeknight and place was pretty slow, ordered the riblets and chicken which was pretty good flavor wise but the food was only warm as if it was sitting for a bit but not gonna complain about that much. Our waitress was more concerned with doing end of night duties instead of taking care of us properly, had to ask bus boy for silverware, I hate speaking up for things like that or seeing her elsewhere and getting her attention for pop or fry refills... At the end of the night she was so eager to get us to pay and finish up but worse was the fact that she asked twice if we wanted change back from cash! I understand she was hoping for a tip but it's very distasteful on her part, my friend paid with bills in order to get rid of some $1s and just get a $10 back. So our waitress gave her a $5 and five $1s back.... How rude. Was planning on leaving a bigger tip up until that point. In my opinion it's better to hit up these places when there busier, for some reason it's a better experience. Or it might just have been our waitress who was in such a hurry to close shop for the night and expect a large tip for subpar service. 3 stars for food 1 star for selfish waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.1559999999999997,3.3200000000000003

I want to love their ""finest"" burgers and the times we had them in Tennessee they were good, but here the ""smoke and pepper"" ketchup had very little smoke or pepper flavor. I do like the buns for these burgers a lot more though. Husband tried the southern charm burger at our last stop. The onions were great but the bacon is supposed to be candied and was decidedly not.

Tete? something like that) was very rude. She was friendly enough (though slow for refills, and never checked back after she dropped food), but got very defensive and rude when we pointed out that our order was slightly wrong. We had two kids at our table who ordered the mac n'cheese from the kids' menu and I had requested their refill come out at the same time as their food (because she'd been so slow). Instead of two dishes and two refills, she brought two dishes, and one refill bowl and tried to serve both baskets (with sides) to one kid, and the plain bowl to the other kid (without his side), claiming it was ""a double portion anyway,"" so we were getting ""the same amount."" I'm sorry, but we weren't concerned about the amount...we were concerned that you brought the order out wrong and expected us to just deal with it. Yes, I could have split up the ""double portion"" bowl you let the kitchen pass off to you, but we were paying to eat there, we should not have to do that. It seems petty writing it down, but seriously, her attitude over my questioning it was uncalled for.

BIG mistake.  15 min wait... no worries, but now we go to the dining room where I have seen school cafeterias with more room. The tables are packed in so tight I had to get up twice to let wait staff and customers by.  But I'm not even sure we had a table.  I have been to resteraunts all over the world and NEVER been asked to sit at a table that rocked, wobbled, and so annoying.  Ya was offered to change tables after we complained and then I tried to fix the table, ""we can get you a new table, will only be a 10-15 min wait.""  No one should ever be seated at a table like this!  It shouldn't even be in a resteraunt.  I will give props to the waitress.  She did her best to manage in a terribe atmosphere.    But the food was substandard at best.  For a place that prides itself in burgers they should not be dry, and for the love of all that's holy give a blue cheese burger some blue cheese.  Give the wraps some actual meat, and there should not be more batter than fish.  But the beer was cold and the fries were warm.  Guess they have that going for em.  What they don't have is any more of my money or business.  Too many other options for much better food where yiu wont be treated like cattle on a rocking boat at sea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick?start=60,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.5400000000000003,2.04

We used to get the orders to go; but after a few bad experiences we've given up.  The last time the sent us out the door with the completely wrong order, but that time they did comp our meal completely. But this shows the lack of detail and attention, again its either understaffed or lack of training. I'm not sure what's going on at the Kennewick store; either understaffed or lack of training. But we've had our last 3 visits end up like this.  It used to be the apple place up the street was the questionable place, but they seemed to have fixed it.  Perhaps its the new minimum wage, but what ever the reason we're not rushing back to this location.  Red Robin also needs to update their menus for those watching things like carbs and calories. I'm shocked that they don't list either throughout and then on some items only calories.  Its time for RR to catch up with other restaurants and provide this for their customers.  Final gripe tonight was the loud ""drill"" sound.  At first I thought somebody was doing construction at 7PM, then figured it must be a blender.  But it was very constant and annoying. Turns out it's their new machine to blow up balloons.  Bad idea on so many levels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,2.08,2.27,2.27,,2.1940000000000004

32,erik K.,"Pasco, WA",26,6,1.0,1.0,2017-07-05,Walked in today at 130pm. Had to wait 5 minutes to get table (not bad). Got to our table and gave our drink order. Waited like 15 minutes and no drinks. Got up and walked out. This is absouluty the worst red robin I've been to. Understaffed and it's been thus way for a while now. I will give red robin a try but not on kennewick.......,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,2.08,2.21,2.21,,2.1580000000000004
25,Tien D.,"Tigard, OR",112,336,429.0,2.0,2017-08-13,"Came here on my last day in Kennewick before heading back to Portland. I usually order the Crispy Chicken Burger every single time I go to a Red Robin restaurant....but on that specific day they had a picture of the Sriracha Burger as a special new menu item, so I decided to go with that. I should have known the photo was too good to be true. The burger that came out turned out quite soggy....similar to the quality you would find at a fast food chain. Also, the sriracha burger tasted nothing like sriracha. And that is coming from an Asian girl who uses sriracha daily. I was almost tempted to ask the waitress to give me a squirt of sriracha, or hand over the bottle so I can get the full spicy experience. There was no heat to the burger, which was disappointing. Also, after asking a passing waitress for a fry refill, I didn't end up getting it and had to ask another waitress a while later. Can't say the service is all bad, some waiters/waitresses were very attentive, others....not so much. Service was very spotty",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,1.96,2.19,2.19,,2.0980000000000003
20,Chelsea S.,"Monterrey, Mexico",0,62,15.0,4.0,2017-09-02,"I'm reveiwing for TO GO service. I used the online app to prefer the a1 burger with fries. I picked the 445 slot and i got there at 430 ish and it was done at 445. I ordered my burger with some pink but it was well. For red robin, it was consistent with the red robins have gone to in other states. I was somewhat disappointed that I didn't get a ton of fries-afterall if you eat in house they are bottomless. The burger was good with flavor. Fries were crispy outside and soft in the middle. I would not sit down and eat there, but if you want a burger a step above fast food it's nice yo be able to buy online and pick it up fast. I ordered at 415 for 445 and it was done in that time. The app wouldn't let me schedule 15 minute pick up so keep that in mind when you order to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,2.08,2.2,2.2,,2.152

Open seating in bar, not too many people, 15min just to get a beer. Finally food came, burger was a mess! I order something new every visit, but this was not appetizing looking. Burger patty was in three separate pieces. Ordered the boss hog - it's got pulled pork! Who wouldn't want that? I got about 2 quarters worth of pork on there - yes, the size of 2 quarters. Haven't even eaten yet, just needed to rant. UPDATE: been battling the oh no's since 1am. Thanks Red Robin, have to call ya out on this one.

29,Skully B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,49,,2.0,2017-10-21,The Red Robin reputation remain solid at this location... So so Burgers overrated fries slow and unprofessional service... However the service at this location is slower than most.  For your own sanity go with the straight cheeseburger and avoid the sloppy calorie-laden sauces loaded on the other burgers. Skip the Brews here they are way overpriced,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,2.16,2.19,2.19,,2.1780000000000004
21,Donald N.,"Richland, WA",1,10,,1.0,2017-12-16,"Worst burger meal ever!  Got the lettuce wrapped burger w a side salad.  The salad was mostly the white portion of iceberg lettuce, slightly light brown at the edges.  The visual was completely unappetizing.  The point is that the kitchen should never have let that salad leave the kitchen. Now to the burger.  When I get a lettuce wrapped burger at Five Guys, the flavors are amazing and the burger patty has remarkable flavor for less cost. The burger patty was near tasteless and the toppings did little to help it. Not going back.  Thus is a high volume, not concerned about quality place.  If you need all those sauces and toppings to mask the blandness of the burger, that tells you all you need to know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
26,M M.,"Pasco, WA",0,16,,2.0,2017-12-23,"I'll start with we have always loved Red Robin. My kids always want to go here. It is my son's favorite place. We have been to so many different ones a number of times. However, my last experience with this place did not go well. I ordered food for my family to go. When we got home they had not included the dressing for my salad. Annoying but I can deal. As I was looking over my salad the Chicken still had pink on it!!!!! It was not fully cooked. Luckily I always check my chicken now after a bad food poisoning experience a few yrs. ago. However, had I not checked, I would currently most likely be throwing up. Chicken with pink is unacceptable! This is the second time I have had chicken from this place with pink still on it. The first time was a chicken sandwich about 6 months ago. I didn't review at the time and let it go as a one time thing. Now that it has happened twice I feel the need to review. Not acceptable. 1* for my food and only a second star because my son loves this place so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,2.2,2.15,2.15,,2.1700000000000004

23,Rick S.,"Richland, WA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-29,"Call it bad luck perhaps but To be honest, I have always been a fan of Red Robin, but I have to say, Kennewick is by far the WORST service and the worst lack of common sense. Like I appreciate that they all are working and all have jobs but I have been there 5 times in the last 5 years, and EVERY time, I kid you not EVERY time they have failed on getting my order correct. I don't even order anything special, literally have gotten it wrong. One time, we went with some family from out of town, they wanted to go there, we all ordered, and for whatever reason forgot to put in my families order, our guests had their food, ate before ours came out, just honestly bad... I'll never go to that one again after tonight, we decided to call in and do a pick up order. Well, surprise surprise, they didn't know what no lettuce or tomato meant, the soup we ordered was literally a few tablespoons of broth, wilted Salad, and forgot parts of the order. Total rip off, once again, not too sure what to do, I tried to complain, I have done everything.. they just won't change",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kennewick,2.12,2.11,2.11,,2.1140000000000003
