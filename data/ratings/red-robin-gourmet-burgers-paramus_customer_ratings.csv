57,Mick L.,"Alpine, NJ",3033,455,3287.0,3.0,2013-10-04,"This is a welcome addition to the Bergen Town Center being the only restaurant with a full bar, great signature cocktails along with a good draft/bottled beer selection Red Robin Gourmet Burgers are consistently good. The restaurant is well laid out but has some service issues to work out. What I like about this location is no children are allowed in the bar/lounge area, this makes for a nice place to kick back and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.The service at the bar is excellent at times, food arrives fast (10 min. ticket times), fresh and hot with plates cleared quickly. If your lucky enough to have Kristen as your bartender she's a delight, well trained and efficient with a great knowledge of the menu. Tess is another story, she must have worked at the DMV before with her attitude and slow indifferent service. When patrons sit at your bar you get them a drink first and then go back to your service bar, minus 1 star from my previous rating of four. Families are welcome to eat in the dining room that is partitioned off from the bar so this is a huge plus for me, in the bar they play decent music at a comfortable level and have a few large TV's tuned to sporting events. Thanks to John the corporate trainer and Junior our server, awesome show great job!  The pricing is reasonable, food above average, most of the staff well trained and management professional, If your already a fan of Red Robin you will not be disappointed. if you have never tried this chain I suggest you do, this particular location stands out from the others in the area thanks to it's addition of a 21+ bar area and a more interesting ambiance than your typical Red Robin or other burger themed restaurants for that matter. Much better experience than Bobbys Burger Palace! BTW No difference between Red Robbin & Red Robin Gourmet Burger LOL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=60,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

56,Jon K.,"Paramus, NJ",1710,331,534.0,3.0,2013-10-14,"This was our first experience at a Red Robin in a very long time.  Also, I believe it was the first time either of us had been to a Red Robin Gourmet Burger. We began with 2 items for the $5 appetizers.   The onion rings were very good and came with ranch sauce and their Campfire sauce.  My wife enjoyed the Campfire sauce with the onion rings.   The second appetizer was the Bar Wings 'b' Yukon Chips - 1/2 order.  I selected the Buzzard sauce for the wings which was described by the waitress to be similar to a Buffalo sauce.  She was right.  The appetizer tasted great but was a questionable value even at $5.  There were only 4 wings!   Red Robin Gourmet has lots of sauces to choose from and are generous with regard to bringing you more etc! Wife's main was the Crispy Arctic Char or Cod.  I have seen both on their online menus and am unsure which one she ate.  She liked the sandwich.  She got the unlimited cole slaw so that we could share. My main was the Burnin' Love burger.  Red Robin Gourmet Burger for some strange reason can't do rare, medium rare, medium etc like the rest of the world.  Instead your options are ""some pink"" or ""no pink"".  Weak.  The burger was very messy.  The actual meat had little to no flavor and is a thinner patty than I prefer.  The sweet potato fries are bottomless.  It is a bit confusing on the menu.  They were very good and I enjoyed dipping them in the Thai chili sauce and the ranch sauce from the onion rings. Service was slightly overbearing but overall very efficient. We passed on dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=60,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
129,Bo B.,"Hackensack, NJ",12,4,,2.0,2013-10-17,"In all fairness this place only opened a week ago so hopefully they'll get better. But let me tell you about my experience. By the way I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could. It certainly wasn't terrible. When we arrived they sat a table of 5 in the bar. Not sure why they would think that a bunch of people in their 40's and 50's would like to be in a very noisy bar during a football game but I digress.  Our waitress informed us that she was 18 and new and never had a waitress job before. When I ordered my burger she informed me that ""medium well"" was the rarest they cook burgers there... really? So after she leaves i go to the front desk where 4 employees are standing around doing nothing. I ask them and none of them have any idea if that is true. ""we aren't waitresses, sorry"" they say.  I ask for the manager and he comes over and thanks me for alerting him, as although they do have a minimum temperature they cook to, he assures me their burgers come out pink on the inside. He has no idea why our waitress told us medium well. Turned out that is what her trainers told her to say. The manager was at a loss. Food came out... it was meh... tasted like a good burger I'd have made myself on the grill outside, nothing special. Some things were not cooked properly but not terrible. When we got our food we realized that there was no salt, pepper or ketchup on the table. When the ""bottomless fries"" came out on one of our plates there was about 12 french fries. When we asked for more... they never came. Then to apologize for never bringing them two different people brought us more even though we were already leaving. We sat waiting for things for entirely too long. This was not the waitresses fault, she was very sweet and attentive albeit not very experienced. But the runners just didn't do their job very well. There is more but I'll not bore you.  The menu is interesting and some nice ideas but I'm not going back to a burger joint that won't cook me a med rare burger, pink inside or not, especially with Zin Burger about 1 mile away, who's Kobe burger is hands down the best burger I've ever eaten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=120,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
190,David M.,"Wyckoff, NJ",1,36,,2.0,2013-10-20,"They are definitely going through some opening issues. Arrived at 6:26 pm. We're told the wait would be 30 min. Well 55 minutes later our table was finally ready. Ordered our drinks and appetizers and the appetizers beat out the drinks. There was a delay with two of the drinks and they did take them off the bill. It was the manger who made that decision on her own. Without us saying anything about. Then we waited close to an hour for our dinner. They ask if you want a little pink or no pink in your burger. Well we all asked for a little pink but that did not happen. None of them had any pink. But we do not like to send back food so we ate them. Also the kids ordered dishes that had riblets in them. There needs to be a mention of how spicy they are as neither of the kids, age 9 and 12 could eat them. They told us after the meal you can request less spicy, but there was no mention of this in the menu. The restaurant also appears very small with a bit of a strange layout. It is going to take some time to work out the kinks. Having been in Red Robins in other areas, this one does not measure up yet. Hopefully it is just new opening headaches and will get better, but it really has a long way to go.  I must say though that the staff was going out of there in the dining room to try and help as they were aware of all of all the issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=180,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

126,Xiomara P.,"Bergen County, NJ",123,312,59.0,3.0,2013-10-30,"Such a jubilant looking place! A lot of families with young children. The minute I walked in i wanted a milkshake. Its got that Johnny Rockets feel to it.  Came on a Sunday to satisfy a burger craving. We sat near bar area since they had the games playing. To eat, I had a bacon cheeseburger with avocado - it was pretty good, although avocado was barely there. Fries were just okay. Steak fries arent my favorite, especially when they're not cooked well. My boyfriend had a regular red robin burger with an egg added to it with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were better than steak fries. As an appetizer we had onion rings which came with  2 dipping sauces - which came after we had our meal. -_-  Service: service was merely okay. The bartender was our waitress. Was polite. Took our order, checked in once, but that was it. Our appetizer was never brought it, when I mentioned it to her after we had our meal, it was still quite a while before it came out. She didn't check to see if we wanted refills on our drinks not anything, checked in once just very early on. Then it took a while to get her attention for bill.  Overall, I was satisfied with our meal. I would return BC I want a milkshake (lol) and bc I really really want to try their blue moon beer milkshakes!

123,Jane C.,"New York, NY",50,85,45.0,3.0,2013-11-01,"I'm only giving it three stars because I've been to other locations and I actually like it at other places, but the one that just opened up at the Bergen Town Centre is really not p to par with the rest. I am hoping that it gets better with time.. I usually try to avoid going to places as soon as they open up.  The service is probably the first thing I would say needs to be improved. EVERYONE is slow here, so I can only assume that maybe they are all inexperienced. The hostesses are friendly and enthusiastic, but the waiters definitely do not seem happy to be there. And again, they are slow.   The food didn't seem to be what I remember from the other locations I've been to (one near the Poconos, PA and the other being in Woodbridge). I ordered Keep it Simple burger with avocados, meat with a little pink in it and steak fries. The burger was very dry, with 3 baby slices of avocado in a condiment cup, 3 slices of pickle, and 3 baby rings of red onion. The steak fries, which usually come in a basket, were given in a small metal ring. I guess it doesnt matter that much since they are bottomless anyway, but who knows how long it would have taken if i had wanted more fries.  Most of my coworkers seemed to like their food though, and their onions rings were actually really good with the right amount of crispy batter. Their mini dogs (I forget the official name) were way too salty - i think the sausage in general was saltier than preferred.  Guess I can't expect a whole lot from a chain restaurant, but I really liked Red Robin until i came to this one. Will go back some time later to see if they've improved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=120,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

124,Lakeshia B.,"Silver Spring, MD",365,128,13.0,3.0,2013-11-05,"Finally I get to sit down and write a lovely review for Red Robin...yyyuummm!!!...who has not heard the catchy jingle on television as burgers, salads, fries, and dipping sauces parade on the screen. I finally got up the nerve to come here since I had never had Red Robin before in my life. I have gone a total of three times and as they say three times is the charm. My first trip here I was served by the lovely Tess at the bar. She took my order after she was finished getting down drink orders for the rest of the bar and the restaurant. I ordered the cup of clam chowder and the Red Robin Royal which came out charred on the bottom, fries less than hot and crispy, but  hey at least my apple martini was good. My second trip, I decided to order a Whiskey BBQ burger add to that bacon, egg, and take away the tomato. The same problem as before but this time they left off the darn barbecue sauce. I decided not to complain because well I was enjoying a great meal with a few minor setbacks. Finally, on my most recent trip which was this past Friday they got it right. Ordered another Whiskey BBQ burger (didn't put on as much and only asked the tomato be removed), got a side of thai chili sauce for dipping my fries, and when it came to me it was ordered and served perfectly. The burger was nice and juicy with some pink in the middle and the fries were cooked to perfection.  So what are the pros of this place? Well if there is one thing I cannot get enough of is the fact that their restaurant and presentation of their food is flawless. I know I have had some problems with my order being made properly, but I hate when I expect to get a great juicy burger topped high with great toppings and instead could have opted for McDonald's and their cheap take on a burger. You do not get this with Red Robin, you get exactly what they advertise and what they sell. The exterior and interior are clean. Cannot stand a dirty place to eat and they always greet and say good bye with a smile on their face (even if they are dead tired).  And the prices are not half bad. For a cup of clam chowder, Red Robin Royal burger, and a good drink I don't recall paying over $30.00. And their happy hour is Monday through Friday from 3-6 pm and from 8 pm to close.  The cons: Well you can read my two previous visits and the mere fact that one time ordered an apple martini and instead of being green and having some kick to it. Heck I got totally opposite of that SMDH But if you at least give it try you will not be disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=120,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38

Server came over right away. Short stack of onion rings appetizer and splurged on shakes.  They don't do medium rare - a touch of pink hamburgers. Shakes great - I love getting the extra in the metal container -onion rings  were better than average. My burger came barely warm. Hubby's steak sandwich was hot. Asked for well done fries - didn't get them.  This part of the restaurant is freezing. Its only 48 degrees and we could not wait to get to the car and crank up the heat.

Then we received our food - the waitress mixed up multiple parts of our burger order. We ate the food anyway, which was decent for being different than what we wanted.

So she takes my order. then my server comes and says sorry.  Okay no problem. pretzel bites were way too greasy and the lil ass sauce of cheese was okay.  the Salt pepper burger was VERY good.  But no ketchup on the table so i asked my server for ketchup and she brought it right away. The problem is they are WAY TOO OVERSTAFF!!! Double the amount of employees to customers.  Maybe it was a slow night? 8:45pm on a friday night.  Hmmmm?? black friday.  well there were so many employees hanging out in 3 groups or more as if they had nothing to do.  i noticed other customers had issues.  the employees looked bored.

115,Geoffrey C.,"Northvale, NJ",114,64,141.0,2.0,2014-01-04,"The Bergen County burger craze continues, this time I thought that Red Robin was smart in their location, offering an alternative to Bobby Flay's Burger Palace within, albeit an outdoor walk to, the Bergen Town Center. I've been to the Clifton location on several occasions and always enjoyed my experience there, so I expected the same good vibes this time around. It had been open for a few weeks already, so already I was going to give them the benefit of the doubt when it came to service. Turned out that service wasn't the problem, the food was. I ordered a Royal Red Robin, with all of its fried egg goodness, and a half order of onion rings. The half order was a new thing for me and was the perfect portion size for my wife and I. My wife had a burger as well, but she couldn't recall which one... What we could recall, however, was the extreme heartburn and accompanying headache that ravaged us for the rest of the night. This was a shame, because I enjoyed eating the burger, it tasted delicious while consuming it, the egg in the Royal Red Robin was cooked perfectly, and the onion rings and it's sauce were crispy and satisfactory.  While the service and friendliness of the staff flourished on what was a busy night, it was surprisingly the food and the effects it had to both of us that failed here.  It affected us so much so, that we swore this place off for the time being. Lucky for Red Robin, my craving for burgers trumps any type of bad memories, so I wouldn't be surprised if I give Red Robin a second chance...hopefully an updated review will follow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=100,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

122,Dan L.,"Closter, NJ",40,5,,1.0,2014-02-11,"This was our first time at this Red Robins location. There were several things wrong that happened that night that makes me never want to go again. First... Our waitress took our order and she didn't articulate how the sauces work. We were hoping to order some, but we wanted to avoid any charges. But she didn't specify which sauces would charge us and just looked at us ""dumbly."" Second... Our food took forever to come out. I think that's the longest I've ever waited for food. Third... The store itself is very cramped. My friends and I felt that we had to squeeze through tables and really try to avoid people just to get to the restroom. What a hassle... Fourth... The waitress put in my friend's order wrong. He wanted his burger without cheese but they put it in so he asked to take it back. It's an error anyone can make so that's not the actual problem. The REAL problem was it took them about another 30-40 minutes just to bring back a new order for my friend. As we saw other orders passing us by repeatedly. Fifth... One of the biggest attractions of Red Robins is the ""unlimited fries."" But they were rather slow with bringing it out. I think our table of 5 asked for more fries about 6 times and we only received fries 3 times (with about 15 minutes wait each time). Sixth... Our waitress brought over the wrong sauces...cmon!! Seventh... Our waitress sent over the manager in her stead at one point because she must have been nervous about messing up our order so many times. The manger did express concern, but I personally felt it was rude she couldn't come approach us herself or even apologize herself. Eighth... They charged us twice for the burger they messed up for my friend. I looked at the bill (and yes the manager compensated us $40) and in essence we were charged for a burger we never even touched. No restaurant I've ever been to ever does that. At the end after several complaints, the manger crumpled up our bill and said we could go. He did apologize too.

Which in my opinion is not a good look if you are supposed to be ensuring that your food is gluten safe.  He said he was going to check that the avocado bacon burger wrapped in lettuce was OK to eat....and he never retuned to confirm my order. Then when my order FINALLY came out... It did not have all the Fresh vegetables that were supposed to be on top& it was on a gluten free bun that was so freezer burned that I just pushed it to the side.   They did not ensure the safety of my allergy because I was sick halfway through my meal, meaning that there was a lack of care with cross contamination in the kitchen.

When we got there we were seated quickly but understand why the whole row of large booths were available because every time the door opened the cold air would hit you.  The servers were very polite and checked up on us constantly which is remarkable considering it seemed only 4 or 5 of them were working the entire floor.  We made sure when we left to tip them well and I hope everyone else did so as well because they were running around non-stop. As for the food, my wife and I both ordered burgers and it took a ridiculous amount of time for us to get our food.  The server apologized to us and we noticed they were making the same apology over and over again to other patrons.  Again, it seems like they have a staffing issue. When we got our food we were both disappointed because the patties were pretty tasteless and even though we both ordered specialty burgers they were really unimpressive and really missed all marks on taste.   I ordered this burger: Burnin' Love, ""The King would approve of this one. Topped with fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa, Pepper-Jack, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll. It's love at first bite.""  and had to put ketchup and their signature seasoning to make it tasty despite all of their toppings.  Our fries were also lukewarm, limp and probably could have used another few minutes in the fryer.

First two times, I've tried their burgers (tip: get the burger with the fried egg on top, I think it's called the Royal Robin. SO GOOD, the egg makes a delicious difference) and the last time I was here I opted to try their buffalo chicken tenders (surprisingly they were good. The buffalo sauce was not overpowering and they did not make the tenders soggy, I would probably order this again if I'm not craving a burger).  They have consistently good food here. The bottomless fries are a great deal. The fries are seasoned well and paired with one of their many sauces (the Thai chili is a personal favorite) you really can't go wrong. Another thing that they do well here are their drinks. Something that I was skeptical to try but ended up really liking was their blue moon milkshake. Yes, it's a beer/milkshake combo but it works. They really emphasize the orange flavor and it just tastes good. You get a hint of beer and even though it beer and dairy don't sound like the greatest combination believe me when I say that the blue moon shake here is really, really good.  The one thing that is hit or miss about this location is the service. The first time I went here the service was AMAZING. Our waiter was really attentive and he constantly was checking up on us and even gave us free sauces because we had mentioned we liked them so much. We didn't need to look around and search for him when we needed something. It was great. The second time, the service was okay. Not as great at the first time, but it also wasn't terrible. The most recent time I was here, the service wasn't great. We had to wait a while to get water refills and when we wanted either refills on fries or something, the waiter was nowhere to be found. Now, I've only eaten in the bar area, not in the family-oriented side, so I don't know if it's just where I'm sitting that makes the service not great. I understand if the restaurant is busy, it's harder to get to everyone and see what they need, but the last time I came here, it was not terribly busy. Maybe I'm being nit-picky, I don't know. They lose a star because service can either be good or bad. I will definitely be back at Red Robin. The prices are decent and the food is good. The mediocre service isn't all that fun, but in this case, the good outweighs the bad and let's be honest, they had me at ""bottomless fries.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=140,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.284,2.4

I piece of fish was also unseasoned and the other was heavily salted.  At some point, after I complained about the server the manager stated that she comped my chowder.  Throughout the meal, service was slow and inattentive.  We requested a refill on the bottomless steak fries.  It never arrived.  Our original waitress was apologetic but unable to resolve that issue.  She kept referring to everyone as ""honey"".  I normally keep my mouth shut, but I pretty much had enough and brought that to her attention.  Overall the experience was miserable and a huge waste of money and time. ***I completed an on-line customer service questionnaire.  For the sake of complete honesty, I just received a phone call from the store manager apologizing for my experience.  Based on his call, I will try this store again, but in the future.  I need to calm down and allow time for Red Robin to correct the obvious service and food preparation issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=160,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.7000000000000002,2.4

(see my other review, or my 'Burgers of Bergen County' list).  The fries were also excellent and I really have no complaints.  This is definitely a very strong four-star restaurant review, if I could give them a 4.5 I would.   Although there are many, many burger restaurants to choose from I can definitely see myself returning to re-visit Red Robbins, to sit at the bar and order another one of those delicious burger and fry combos sometime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=60,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.032,2.6

My major problem is the quality of the food.  The amount of fries you get with your burger is minute, no more than a hand full.  Granted, yes, it is bottomless but I could imagine how annoying it would be to keep having to refill.

Chips were soggy, chicken dry and ranch dressing tasteless.   While I don't expect anything spectacular out of this or any other chain, I think they could do better. The restaurant, while visually pleasing, is laid out in a weird fashion with many of the booths placed along a narrow corridor.  Also worth mentioning is that, while the place was less than 10% full, the mens room was in shambles with paper towels strewn about the floor.

The appetizer we ordered were the pretzel bits, and two burgers  as our entree. We waited a good 30-45 for our food to come. And they totally skipped our appetizer. We got our burgers first and when i mentioned the appetizer, they said a manager would handle it (never saw so called manager). Our waitress only came before to place our order so she was MIA for most of the time. Our appetizer came right when we finished eating our burgers and it was horrible. I always ordered them at other locations but here i didn't even want to try them. My boyfriend lifted the plastic cup holding the cheese and half of it was melted(as if they put it in the microwave). Not wanting to make a scene i just wanted to ask our waitress if it was possible just to get a new side of the cheese saw.

I had an alcoholic version of some kind of strawberry/lemonade drink & really enjoyed its size, flavor, & the edible macerated strawberries. As in any chain restaurant in this genre, don't expect fresh quality vegetables but the burgers themselves were decent as was my bbq chicken burger; I wouldn't say they're worth $10+ each, but they're decent. The onion rings are really good and worth getting for sure.  The all you eat fries concept is what led me to always wanting to try red robin (cue music, yum) but they were pretty disappointing.

45,Justin C.,"Washington, DC",60,271,,2.0,2015-04-28,"I love Red Robin. I really do. I have so many great memories of Red Robin which is why it hurts to give this place 2 stars but it really deserves 2 stars. I would give it 1 star but the Red Robin name alone prevents me from doing so. Also, I reserve my 1 star ratings for the absolute WORST of the worst.  So why do I hate this Red Robin? 1) Ambiance - I've been to a lot of Red Robins, but this one by far has the worst ambiance. It seems like there was zero thought put into the arrangement of the furniture or décor. The main area looks way too tight. Even the tables look cheap.  2) Food - Most of my vitriol is for the food. The food quality here simply sucks. Not only have some of my friends gotten sick from the food here, the food just doesn't taste fresh or good! I've been to this location three times (I know I'm an idiot for coming here that many times) and every time, my burgers (I've ordered three different burgers) were really soggy. I feel like even the order of the burger ingredients were off which only adds to the poor quality. Why would you put onion strings at the very bottom of the burger??? We also ordered wings this time, and they looked so old and dead. I expect wings to look fresh and have that orange glow, but these wings looked like they came straight from the fryer and sat out for a long time. I always ask for well-done fries, but even if I don't give special instruction, they should come out fresh and semi-crispy. Here, you tell them ""well-done"" and the fries still come out soggy and not fresh. Major disappointment.  3) Service - If you sit at the bar, you'll get pretty good service but in the other areas, the servers aren't very attentive even when the restaurant is empty.  I only came here a third time btw, cause I had to get my free birthday burger and this is by far the closest Red Robin around. I won't be coming back here again. Next time, I'll drive the extra distance and go to the Clifton Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=60,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.152,2.24

Our waitress was very nice and did her best to take care of us and run the bar. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers for the table.  Appetizers were the pretzel bites with cheese dipping sauce and the onion ring tower with 2 different sauces. The onion rings were really good. Nice think cut onions with a really enjoyable crunch factor. The pretzel bites were good as well but nothing to write home about. Would still order them again though.  For my main course I decided on trying the Southern Charm burger. Black Angus patty glazed with brown sugar and topped with candied bacon, honey BBQ sauce (that I got on the side), cheddar cheese and caramelized onions (got frizzled instead) on a toasted ciabatta bun. My burger was good but nothing I would write home about. I really didn't enjoy the ciabatta bun but that was my fault for trying to deviate from the plan.

We have some complaints too.  As mentioned in other reviews, many families bring young children and they can be loud or disruptive to people who want a quiet meal.  The managers are very agreeable and will move you if you aren't happy. Same if you don't like the way something is prepared. (We have found inconsistencies in preparation )  If you are polite and don't act like an idiot, most restaurants are happy to give you what you want.  I don't understand why people don't speak up if they aren't happy with something.  They just gripe in the review.   What we have mentioned but can't get changed: We have noticed that the company has changed many things that we really liked.  We used to LOVE the salads. They were made just right, had croutons and I can't explain why, just tasted great.  They changed that to little square bowls and no croutons and they just aren't as good.  While the Mac and Cheese is still good, they started putting it in the little square bowls as well. The servings are much smaller.  When we mentioned this, we got a ""Change is good"" response.  Obviously, these are corporate decisions and the managers just have to go along with it.  While you do get unlimited refills on the salads and such, they just aren't as good.  Fries are still good. There is a questionnaire with the check. I hope the RR Corp reads these.  We don't come as often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=100,2.48,2.4,2.4,2.384,2.432

The French onion soup was horrid. Returned the soup. Burgers came next nothing great for $14 a burger. Bottomless fries means nothing because the waitress came by once and forgot to bring more fries.

And, that table actually asked them if they received the correct order, but without even checking, the server just say ""yes"", but it wasn't. So we had to wait another 15mins for our order to actually arrive. It was nice that they gave us some discount for that inconvenience but we were almost ready to leave if it wasn't for the desperate hunger we were feeling already.

The floors were sticky the entire walk to the table. The table was sticky and hadn't been wiped ?for the day?, longer? Any place that I hate put my forearms on the table due to stickiness, is a no-no. The server was nice, helpful and patient with us. Kudos to her. They do have mobile stations where you can order food and play games/apps ($1.99 for unlimited app play). Be careful not to let the little ones play with the device, they can order games and apps to their hearts desire and you will get billed. Once you hit a game/app there is one confirmation screen in case you made a mistake, and if you hit yes again, you'll be billed. We left it alone and chose the human server instead. There were larger flat screen TVs around showing the Olympic games which was nice. Now, the 2-3 star portion of my review, the food. Food didn't take long to come. I ordered a massive burger because it looked good and I am glad to say that it was good. The toppings were fresh and adequate. I have to say that it was really satisfying, coming from a chain restaurant. We also had the pizza (blah), shrimp (blah), chicken tenders (semi-blah) and mac and cheese (double-blah). In their defense they do advertise and are probably known best for their burgers, and they should be. If you go, order burgers.... that's about it. Anything else will likely leave you disappointed. Though chicken tenders, fries, nachos, onion rings and other items that most likely come frozen to be thrown into a deep fryer are probably safer bets. I regret my $50 experience but I can say that I tried it. Lesson learned. A plus was that you can pay at the table using the device. No more waiting for the ""check"" which is honestly to me the most dreadful part of eating out. Swipe your card, and a couple of clicks later, you're gone. It even calculates and recommends the different tips that you can choose from, which I know for some is a pain as well. More restaurants should have that option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20,2.72,2.4,2.4,2.444,2.528

But, I really didn't care because Koray was a great server and provided amazing service. He was very prompt and attentive continuously asking us if we needed any refills on our bottomless sides and drinks. He was knowledgeable about the Red Robin menu and went to great lengths to explain what a Red Robin Tavern was. He apologized profusely when they ran out of the whole wheat hamburger bun and offered a plethora of other bun options. He even informed us how we could get half-off for our kid's dinner. He was so generous with his time and hospitality, we decided to still pay full price for the kid's meals.

My wife's cell phone was stolen off the table. The manager refused to look at the security cameras to see who did it. The phone remained inside the building for almost 4 hours proving it was an employee of red robin.

24,Jessi T.,"Maywood, NJ",287,351,201.0,5.0,2016-12-09,"I've been to this Red Robin twice before my last visit.  I've always tended to avoid it because I wasn't crazy about the service or the food but this last time was awesome.  Two palms up.  It's a 10. 1. Speed- The food came out quickly.  I was starving.  Thank you, Red Robin. 2. Service- The service was friendly and awesome. The waitress made me feel welcome and helped elevate my dining experience with her great attitude. 3. Burger- Usually, the food is too greasy but my Whiskey River BBQ burger was made just right and a Hail Mary burger in my desperate time of hunger.  I've ordered this burger before and it's usually so messy and greasy.  This time, it was on point and perfect.  I ate it with very, very minimal bbq mess to the hands. 4. Electronic thingy- Their electronic ordering thingy at the table (it looks like a tablet) actually worked properly.  A few times, I've had these things on my table as defunct table ornaments but this worked great and made paying and ordering extra things a very easy thing. 5. Dessert- Um, have you tried the mudpie?  It's like, the dream of my childhood.  It's like a gigantic slice of ice cream cake but made with oreos.  It's fantastic.  It's very sweet.  It's self indulgent to order it.  It's awesome. 6. Clean bathroom- Hooray for cleanliness! 7. Lowered sink in bathroom- There's a tiny sink in the bathroom for your tiny child to clean their tiny hands without you having to carry them up to the stink to do it.  How thoughtful of Red Robin to make that. 8. Location- Located on the not busy side of The Bergen Town Center, there's ample parking, which is a big plus during the holiday season. 9. Bottomless fries- Their fries were great and not greasy and also, you can refill your fries.  Who does that? 10.  Freckled lemonade- I had forgotten how much I loved this drink.  It's awesome.  It has sweetened strawberries pureed and sliced, put into the drink.  A lot of times, I don't like too sweet, but this is a sweet drink that I like.  Definitely, get this drink, as long as you aren't allergic to strawberries.  Or lemons. And bonuuuusss..... they have a bar!  I love bars and a good drink.  Does that make me sound alcoholic?  Actually, I don't think I've ever had a drink at this Red Robin but it's always nice to know that the option is there. I will definitely go back.  Hopefully, after I run a marathon because I gained about 10lbs after eating all the delicious food here.  Also, don't come in here judging this place with standards meant for Per Se.  It's Red Robin for crying out loud!  It's awesome for Red Robin and comparable restaurants.  The service though, that could've been high end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20,2.96,2.4,2.4,2.868,2.624

AND THEY'RE BOTH BOTTOMLESS. - Great service (Our server from yesterday, Nelly, was especially awesome!) I also love that RR is one of the many restaurants that uses those electronic pads on each table that allow you to call your server, order more food/drinks, and pay for your check whenever you're ready.  ---------------------------------- MY ADVICE FOR MANAGEMENT (and the reason why I deducted a star): ***Please be mindful of your incoming crowd on busy Friday/weekend nights, and have enough hosts working to handle that crowd.*** Last night (Friday) around 8pm, I patiently waited at the host stand for over 5 minutes for someone to write my name down as I watched the hostess run all over the place. (I'm used to waiting for a table on busy nights, but not so much for someone to simply write my name down and tell me how long the wait is.) When she finally stopped running around, she just started taking names in the middle of the room instead of at the host stand. When I politely said ""excuse me"" to grab her attention, she put up her index finger at me as if to silence me then ignored me for a few seconds. Then she looked up, realized she never wrote my name down, then someone seated our table of 2 right away. I ALWAYS give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt and I even saw the manager running the food out to help, so I'm assuming someone called out or was late. But at the end of the day, the host is the person who sets your dining standard upon walking into a restaurant and there should always be someone up there to greet the guests and put them on a wait list if it's busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus,2.8,2.4,2.4,2.7039999999999997,2.56

I know they were open cause I saw people sitting and eating. What I didn't see were employees. So right about the time we started to sit ourselves, someone came out of the kitchen. He sat us and left. A server came up to the table and asked if we ever been there before we, Responded no. She took our drink order and shortly after we ordered my daughters food and nachos to share. Meatballs on a stick.  Moments later the server came back and we ordered our food. My wife ordered a ghost chili burger well done and I ordered a pepper something burger med rare.  So the nachos and my daughters food came out. The nachos were good. My daughters food on the other hand wasn't. The meatballs were rock hard and cold. Only thing she ate was 2 helping of broccoli and fries from our meal.several times I had to ask for a refill and napkins.  My wife's burger came out which she was happy about. My burger was over cooked. I asked the server if she could take it back. I explained that I ordered the burger med rare and it was cooked well done. She apologized and told it back. Meanwhile my wife only took a couple bits waiting for my food to arrive. Approx 5mins went by and it returned. Now I was expecting a raw burger. How cooked can a burger get after cooking for about 5mins..  well I cut it open and it was well done again!!! Questing the freshness of the burger. I believe they precook the food. This time I waved down a manager. She claimed to be in training. I asked if I could speak to someone that cold help if she couldn't. She told me to tell her what's I needed to. After explaining about our issues, she stated that we needed to talk to the manger. So a manger came out of the kitchen. She came to the table pretty much yelling at us. She stated that they don't cook the burgers under med what restaurant doesn't know how to cook. To continue getting a temp wrong. For a manager to come to the table to say this is crazy! When asking her name she refused to tell me when I asked for the general managers name she looked at me and walked away.  Since they had a thing on the table to pay we did it that way. They were taking forever to return to the table with the check. When I called the corp number the lady on the phone say in order to get any kind of gift card everyone from my group had to call and complain. This includes my 15mth daughter.

At this point we had already placed our order with Deanna (our server) with DBear fixing and bringing our drinks which is a good system since it allowed for less wait time and quick service.  I had a salmon entree and burger with broccoli and fries which was very good. No complaints and ended up leaving a seemingly clean plate. Fries weren't drenched I salt like most places have a habit of doing. The salmon was well cooked and tasted great and the broccoli was at the perfect texture.

Upon exiting our car and approaching the entrance, I noticed an employee in their bright red shirt leaning against the building wall having a cigarette. My first impression was not a favorable one. I don't care if a person smokes, but employees shouldn't be hanging out in front of the building looking like they have nothing better to do. We received a nice greeting from the manager and another employee. The place was empty for lunch, probably due to the weather. We were seated and then greeted by the gentleman who was smoking out front, and smelled like smoke. Not a pleasant smell. We ordered ""gourmet"" burgers, onion rings and sweet potato fries. The meal came quickly. That alarms me, but the place was empty. I ordered the A.1. Peppercorn burger. It was good, just good. Worthy of a ""gourmet"" title? No. It wasn't worthy of the $11.89 price, either. For that price, the sweet potato fries shouldn't have cost me an additional $1.49. I thought $2.99 for my friend's soda was pretty steep. I don't drink soda, so I don't know if it is. I drink water. My friend liked her BBQ burger. Her onion rings were good. This was my first visit to a Red Robin. No compelling reason to come back when Habit Burger is closer to home, better and cheaper. There is a little kiosk on every table that allows you to pay your bill, play games and watch their advertising. The trivia game was on while we dined. We jumped in the game while we waited for the rain to let up. An additional $1.99 appeared on my bill for ""Entertainment"". It turns out that you have to pay to play. It doesn't tell you before you jump in the game. We were told by the manager that it is mentioned on the first splash screen that appears after you are seated. We didn't see it. All we saw was a game in progress, so we played. The charge was removed from my bill. The kiosk is convenient for paying your bill, as you don't have to wait around for your server to bring it to you. The receipt is printed for you, too. Overall, the experience was just okay, nothing special. Gourmet? No. Just a fancy marketing title.

The food itself was okay.  The chicken was a little dry.  The salsa had an odd taste.  I think it had too much lime in it.   Red Robin will never be a place I actively seek out to dine,  but if the group wants to go I will go.  I guess I will just have to stick to non burger food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus,2.68,2.56,2.56,,2.608

We waited about 10 minutes for the waitress to come by our table and asked if we were ready. We gave her the drink order while we decided on what we wanted. The waitress came by 10 minutes later and we ordered the food. My kids and I felt like the waitress was not helpful, cordial or even human.... she acted more like a robot (no feelings or reactions). The food was ok but I remember when the food was great. The over all experience was very poor and did not leave me with a great taste in my mouth.

1,Grace Lee A.,"New York, NY",37,335,54.0,1.0,2017-08-12,"I enjoy Red Robin but not the establishment and not the service. It is really hit or miss, and when it's a miss it is just absolutely sh*tty.  Just god awful. Deanna was our server and she seemed courteous in the beginning then things quickly went sour when she started making stank faces at us and at some point thrust the menu in my husbands face when he asked to see it again, and it was baffling how nasty she was. She literally threw the automated table side computer thing in front of him when he told her he wanted to put his royalty number into the order. Wow! Then she goes to the next table and turned on this dr jekyl and Hyde multiple personality thing and was gushing smiling at them and asked them how their meal was and she did not ask us once how our meal was or asked if we need a drink refill.   This is why when I have a craving for Red Robin, my better judgment kicks in and stops me. The service is horrific and inconsistent. Deanna just proved to me that there is no hope for Red Robin as a service establishment. Is management in this company so horrendous that all their workers are persistently unhappy and nasty to their customers? I believe their store manager name is Adolfo, and I only know this because I heard a complaining customer at another table inquiring for his name.  Our service tonight was so atrocious that i will be calling him out for the poor attitude of his store staff, specifically Deanna.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus,2.88,2.58,2.58,,2.7

We told our server and she explained to the manager. All he did was take the food off the bill. He never came out to apologize and ask if there is anything else they can get you. Even the waitress did not ask. They finally offered a free dessert. I paid the bill and we left without me even eating my food. When a manager cannot make the effort to come out and make sure the customer is satisfied with the service and find out what happened that is just absolutely poor customer service and shows you do not care about your customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus?start=20,2.96,2.64,2.64,,2.7680000000000002

Aside from the strawberry freckled lemonade everything was pretty awful. I couldn't believe I had stopped watching Stranger Things season 2 episode 7 to go here (should have ordered in). The nachos were horrible and I had to send them back because of the cold chili. After that everything was an entire disaster. I wish I was Toothless so I could not even attempt to eat this.

12,Yerika J.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,3,,2.0,2017-11-15,I went here yesterday at my daughter's request. We quickly regretted it. She was hungry and beginning to have a headache so we figured this would be pretty quick and easy. We were wrong. I will say that the host and waiter were friendly. But we had to wait so long for everything. The place was pretty empty and yet it took an extremely long time for our order to be put in and then to get our order. After admitting to forget to put our order in the waiter cane back to tell us they didn't even have what my daughter ordered. I felt so bad as her headache just kept getting worse during all this wait.  I just don't understand all the waiting and issues on such a slow night. Their solution was to bring fries while we waited and then a free dessert that my daughter kept saying she didn't even want.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-paramus,2.88,2.61,2.61,,2.718

When we walked in there was a lot of people near the entrance waiting to be seated and a hostess no where to be found. We stood there for a good 10 minutes until one of the waitresses came by and took names down and seated everyone. Once we got seated, we  put in our drink, appetizer & entree orders at once because we both knee what we wanted. We didn't get our drinks for another 20 minutes. When we got our appetizer, the soggy pretzel bites, our burgers came out like a minute after so we had all the food out together. My sister got the new sriracha tavern doue burger and I ordered the taco tavern double. My burger was missing pretty much all the ingredients that made it a taco tavern burger... I told my server and she said that's the right order but quickly got me a new burger. It didn't really taste as expected.

I'm sorry to the managers and owners because they are really nice but don't come here. I've been coming here since it opened and it has gone down hill as drastically. At first it was a good place for a burger and would often drive decent crowds. Since then, they've started to slack off in food quality. For example on my most recent visit, the cake I had was as hard as a rock. Now nobody comes here and there are more employees there than customers. It's honestly creepy. I've also seen fights break out here and the workers saying that that is pretty normal and we shouldn't worry about it.
