Ben O.,"Monroe, LA",293,577,539,3.0,9/15/2008,"A nice place to drink, but not much zing on the menu.  TGI Friday's is one of those places you go because you're meeting friends there, not because they're serving something you crave. My French-fried green beans could have been French-fried French fries for all I could tell.  Only a sickly old-avocado color, and no vegetable taste, testified to the origins of what was jacketed inside the batter. On the other hand, there are cheap beers (I had a pint of Miller Lite for $2) and decent people-watching, as well as a fully enclosed smoking section, also known as the bar. TGI Friday's is also the home of my wife's favorite cocktail, the Ultimate Lights of Havana.  If she wants to get all liquored up before I take her home, who am I to argue?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-4
Scott M.,"Palm Beach, FL",626,460,,1.0,9/9/2009,"I havent been to Fridays in at least 5 yrs.  But as of late, I have noticed that they are pretty much giving away their food, which seemed like an open invitation for me to step on in... That was one step that I wish I had never taken.  Sigh.  One of my first jobs was TGI fridays, and I remember how much I used to love the food and the restaurant.  Great energy, great food, great everything, and always packed. The place sucks now.  Service is bad, bartenders suck. I ordered a spinach dip and wings, the bartender forgot to ring in my spinach dip, and the wings came out and were over cooked and disgusting.  I might have eaten 8 of them until I realized I couldnt take the punishment anymore. This place isnt what it used to be and its kinda sad... I will NEVER go back to this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-4
Alasha B.,"Savannah, GA",61,114,,1.0,10/15/2009,"Oh they closed this joint? I was just there less than a month ago. TOTALLY explains the awful service ( apparent low morale) but doesn't excuse it. The wait staff was slow, rude, and inefficient.  We were sitting for quite a while before our food orders were taken although drink service was fast, if bumbling and incorrect upon arrival. Our food was mostly over or undercooked, and the waitress just seemed a little... special if you will.  Wasn't able to comply with simple requests for dessert (I was mad that anyone in my party even bothered, after the wack meal). Even the manager was apathetic and ineffective. We had to chase him down to pay the bill. Why would we have to chase down a manager to pay the bill? Exactly.  Now, you KNOW they would have sent a search party after our asses had we just walked, right? Good f-ckin riddance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-4
Jane K.,"Tallahassee, FL",2,16,3,5.0,7/11/2009,"The food is really good, especially the Jack Daniels sauce, and the service is better then it used to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-4
Michael D.,"Elmer, NJ",158,34,,4.0,9/6/2009,"This place is great i always love Fridays never have a bad meal.  I had the pecan crusted salmon it was so flavorful WOW!  The sweet, nutty flavor keeps you wanting more.  The portion is huge but in the end the perfect size.  The service was great hell the waiter was cute too LOL!.  His name is Sean btw lol.  The place gets busy around 6 so go early or later in the night we went at 3 and the meal came out with-in 15 min.  They have beer specials and drink specials everyday check them out online or go from 11-3 for lunch specials on weekdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-4
anthony s.,"Stockbridge, GA",2,10,1,2.0,7/5/2009,"This place was all-bad. The waitress we had was so uninspired and did not show an ounce of wanting to be at work. She was extra slow....and when I asked her how a drink tasted, she seemed dumbfounded with no intent to please my question....On the other hand the food was good(sizzling chicken and shrimp). The bartenders were very misleading and trying to flirt with the ladies at the table and it backfired on the customer(Me). That is a long story by itself. I will never go to this particular Fridays again if I don't have to. MY EXPERIENCE WAS HORRIBLE!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-4
Joseph B.,"Marietta, GA",22,5,,4.0,10/1/2009,"Ok now I am so confused right about now!!! I am a big Friday's fan. I am one of their Give Me More Stripes members. Every $1 I spend is a point I get and once I receive 100 points I get an $8 off coupon to use in any of the restaurants.  So far I have gotten 2 of these in the past 3 or 4 months (which shows how much I frequent this place). Lol. But I was surprised to have gotten a coupon emailed to me the other day with the title ""While Some Doors Close, Others Open"" and at the bottom of the coupon it showed 3 stores that apparently are closed. 2 of those 3 stores I frequent because of location--the Buckhead store on Peachtree and the Atlanta/Marietta store on Powers Ferry.  So I just need to know what is going on. Are they permanently closed due to business factors or was it because of the flood or what. I was just in the Buckhead store about 2 weeks ago. I am just at a loss of words. And then when I google it gives me no information whatsoever. If anyone knows anything about this please inform me. Thank you my fellow Yelpers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-4
