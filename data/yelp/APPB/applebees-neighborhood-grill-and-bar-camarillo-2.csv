I came in so excited for my birthday lunch and our server Sophia H was rude and unaccommodating and wouldn't let me order what I had wanted and completely ruined my birthday lunch and we left because of how awful this experience was. She completely ruined my day and my birthday and I am astounded by how terrible a person could be.

Alison H.,"Camarillo, CA",37,11,1,1.0,5/11/2016,I was very disappointed in the service my family and I received during dinner the other night. Not one out our three dishes came back remotely edible or made how we had ordered and the wait time to receive our food was over 45 mins. We never were asked for a refill on our drinks even. The table next to us ended up leaving and canceling their order due to the wait time as well.  The prices were high for the quality. I asked for my burger to be well done and it came out mooing.. My daughters pasta was cold and slimy and my husbands chicken was very dry.  Definitely NOT going back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=20
Destany S.,"Spring Valley, CA",17,123,74,1.0,12/1/2016,So we walk in and get seated. Our server Priscilla came and got our drink order then walked away. We had no menus so we couldn't even see what food we wanted. So I finally asked and got a menu. Next I ordered a side salad. Our server brings the salads to the table and walks away. We have no silverware. Am I supposed to eat with my hands ? I had to walk to another table and take silverware. Terrible service applebees.

Samantha G.,"Camarillo, CA",56,2,,1.0,1/17/2017,The food tastes like it's warmed up in a microwave my fries came out half cold already. Not even crispy.

Alissa E.,"Oxnard, CA",509,28,236,1.0,7/30/2015,"I came here the day they were showcasing their new appetizers for free. Our waiter spoke to us condescendingly throughout the duration of our time there. Not to mention she also brought the wrong orders THREE times and failed to apologize for doing so.

Michael S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",2,41,53,4.0,5/29/2016,"Surprisingly the food was served warm enough and tasty. The problem was the very long wait after ordering. It took 20 minutes for the appetizer sampler platter to arrive. No chips or bread so when we waited 7:00 pm on a Sunday night even the fake flappy bird fame was not satisfying.  The server was pleasant; it's a family friendly bar atmosphere.  The regular hamburger is good. The beer with onion squashed in the patty was good, they forgot the sauce on the side, oh well. The Cesar salad with ""easy dressing"" was not easy, again, oh well.  The two top sirloin steaks were better than I expected. The green beans good, a little garlic I think on then, but good macaroni was ok, but like baked crusty macaroni.  I think they need one more server there, but the guy was nice.  The men's restroom's air conditioning was like a meat locker.  Id go again, but only if the Fish Lure next door had a 30 minute wait the Fish Lure is classy, tasty and has great servers. Probably because they are making money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=20

Gloria P.,"Ventura County, CA",457,297,2549,3.0,2/21/2015,"Decent food. Fair prices. Good lunch and dinner specials. Service was good. There is a tablet on each table that can be used to order and pay for your meal. We did not use it to order but did use it to pay. Kinda cool. There are also games available for a fee.  I had a Bloody Mary it was good and spicy. For my meal I went with the bourbon chicken and shrimp which came with roasted potatoes. I was satisfied with my meal. My boyfriend had the double crunch shrimp which he enjoyed. I stole a couple of his fries and I wanted more. What I like here is their menu with a variety of foods and deals. 2 for $20 deals and lunch specials. There is something for everyone. Soups, salads, appetizers, sandwiches, steak, chicken, fish, pasta etc etc. a large drink menu too.

We ordered the 2 for $25 dollar meal that came with a free appetizer. We ordered the artichoke and chips. As i was eating that, all of a sudden, i felt a pain coming from my mouth. It felt like i had bitten into a rock. I pulled it out of my mouth and looked at it. It was a piece of glass!! I told the waitress and she told her manager. He came up to me and said, ""sorry"" and walked away. I guess, he thought since i wasnt making a scene he had gotten away with it. I asked for the bill and the waitress asked me how my meal was. They were going to try to pretend that it was not a big deal. Finally, after giving them multiple opportunities to make it right, i realized, they were not going to do it unless i made them. I said, it should go without saying, i am not going to pay full price for something that i could not eat because there was broken glass in it ... the manager gave me $10 off the bill ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=20

He always made sure we were ok and he was great to talk to. We are from Fresno and this Apple Bee's is the best one I've been to by far! I would definitely recommend this place.

Food half the time comes out room temperature or not at all and you have to remind them and remind them about getting your drink refilled after it's been sitting empty at the side of the table for the past 10 minutes.

Mike T.,"Camarillo, CA",32,14,2,1.0,10/15/2015,I've been to this Applebee's multiple times. The quality of food has gone down hill horribly. My wife and I had one alcoholic drink each and a main course for dinner. It was a $60 bill. Paying $60 you would expect at least decent food with decent presentation.  The food was absolutely horrible. We both had to replace our initial order because it was terrible. The second choice we ordered was also terrible.  The service was totally fine. The staff has always been welcoming and the manager was welcoming the customers. The cooks at this location need to be replaced.

Tiffani H.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/19/2016,"Horribleeee service would be an understatement for tonight. To start... My server barely introduced herself, or even said hi for that matter.  No personality, no smile, just a server who came across very rude right off the bat. After we waited about 30 minutes to order, she brought me a refill of the wrong drink). Didn't check on us once during the appetizer. Once we got our food (which was served in a decent amount of time, by a different server) she didn't check on us once! Oh, and she forget part of my meal too.  Anyways, during the entire meal and not once did she think to ask us how the food was or if she could get us anything. And she walked by us numerous times!!!  Towards the end, I had to ask the manager for a take out box, because again she was no where to be found. When the bill came, I told her I had a gift card, and asked her what to do and she said she didn't know. I asked her ""well.. Can you ask a manager?"" And she rudely walked away.  She dropped the check off at the table after she figured out how to pay the damn bill, and didn't say thank you, have a good night. Nothing.  Now, I usually am not one to complain but as soon as I left I asked to speak to the manager and told him about my horrible dining experience (on my son's birthday, mind you) and he didn't apologize for the behavior or anything. He did say thank you for letting him know but that's as far as that went.  Very rude and very unprofessional.   I have been to this location a few different occasions, because I love the food, but unfortunately I always have pretty shitty service. Tonight topping it all.  But, this was my last time. Thank you Applebees for ruining my dinner experience with my kids, on my son's birthday! Word of advice for Applebees.... Hire better servers.  Word of advice for future diners.... McDonald's would give you better service than here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=40

James S.,"Oxnard, CA",141,21,4,2.0,7/28/2016,"I must start out by saying that my server, Casey, was incredibly professional and sweet. That's where the good experiences stopped. I ordered an iced tea and it tasted like there was dirty dishwater in it. I didn't notice anything in the smell but the flavor definitely had something foul in it. I asked my server to exchange it comma which she did thankfully. I ordered a chicken dish on a plate that burnt my hand. I believe it was the manager that brought it out to me and he did warn me that the plate was hot comma but I didn't realize that it would be scolding hot, and fresh out of the microwave. What I really don't understand is how nice slab of gelatinous chicken, which most likely comes in Frozen, could have been pink on the inside. I ate around it, and inspected every piece I ate to make sure that it was fully cooked. The mash potatoes and the onion strings as well as the chicken all had a very bad chemically aftertaste. I was originally planning on ordering and dessert with my dinner, but I didn't want to risk getting yet another bad day. I'm very thankful that they were open so late at night since I work late, but at this point McDonald's taste better. I would even go as far as saying that shriveled up 7-Eleven hot dog would have been a more tasty and satisfying meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=40

Jonathan H.,"Oxnard, CA",3,4,1,4.0,9/27/2015,"We haven't been to Apple Bee's in a while; primarily because their menu was very limited and the food felt overpriced for what you actually ate.  But kudos to Apple Bee's for upgrading their food AND drink menu. We went during rush hour 5PM. And we got great service from Brandy! She was on point and delivered fast service as she knew we were on dinner break from work.  She recommended the Sangria (with Jack Daniel's blends) and its probably the best Sangria I have ever had. It wasn't too strong nor too weak, it was perfect. But it does creep up on you so be careful! But it's a must!!  Not only did they upgrade their food styles, but their staff is much nicer and happier. Their bartenders are just skilled in what they do! Great job guys! Cheerios!   PS.

I've always wanted to try their margarita drank with the upside down corona because it looks like a good way to start a fun night lol It was tasty and not too strong which I liked :) Potato spirals were delish especially with their dipping sauce and sliders were beefy. The french fries were okay and the nachos were meh.  One of my friend's boyfriend ordered a steak plate and his proportions came out really small.

Robin F.,"Camarillo, CA",96,21,3,2.0,12/24/2015,"Coming in two hours before closing on Christmas Eve is a recipe for disaster, and this meal was just that. My friend and I ordered classic cheeseburgers with fries. The burgers came, and I was stunned by how small they were. Then I noticed that there was nothing but the meat and cheese. The waiter must've caught my look, because she asked if we wanted the lettuce, pickle, tomato, and onion that was supposed to be on the burgers! We told her yes!   When the lettuce and stuff came, we asked her to please bring mayo and mustard as by then we had noticed the burgers had no dressing of any kind. She seemed surprised we requested it, but she eventually got it to us.  All the while, country Christmas music blared from the speakers. Super annoying.  The food was actually good. The fries were crispy, and the burger, though minuscule, was tasty.  The service wasn't horrible. The waiter was nice, she just seemed out of it. Everything was just a little off, a little weird.

Juliana J.,"Venice, FL",1082,164,688,3.0,8/24/2015,Their service is not very good and they have messed up my order a few times but the reverse happy hour which starts at 9pm is totally worth going to. The wonton tacos with some Tabasco are really good and the spinach dip is also very good. I also recommend the quesadilla. I went for the reverse happy hour and spent $35 on 5 people and we gorged! Great deal! The low cal food is also good and reasonably priced. Definitely not a bad way to go for low cal dining. Check out their desserts also very good.

Servers going through the whole process like a bunch of robots. They can't smile and or show any facial expression as if they were enjoying any part of helping you. In the future I can see servers be replaced with the mobile pos they have a tables. I will probably stay away for a while.

James L.,"Camarillo, CA",64,21,10,3.0,1/15/2015,"Went to lunch with a friend and ordered our food, drinks and appetizer. The drinks came. She ordered a virgin pina colada. It wasnt blended thoroughly...shouldnt have to chew on ice pieces.  Appetizer we ordered was the spinach dip. It wasnt very good. It tasted as if it was reheated...very bland. Next our food order comes to the table by a different server and our server Sophia M. dropped off our bill as soon as the food was brought to us. We didnt even take our first bite yet. My friend finally was able to tell her that her virgin drink wasnt done right and didnt want it. It was taken off our bill. The food was decent minus the appetizer and drink. Next time we wont go in the afternoon if we can help it.  Will have our friends serve us that we already know will give us better service.

Ash I.,"Camarillo, CA",3,48,12,1.0,5/11/2013,"So my family went to dinner here and unfortunately I couldn't make it. My mother ordered me a cheesecake because I was stuck at work and was craving some. She asked the waiter if they had cheesecake, they only had cherry cheesecake and she asked if they could make it plain for me since I wouldn't be home til later. Waiter was nice and said they could just not add the cherries. That was fine.  Until she actually got the to-go box. It came in a round container that you get at Asian restaurants for your to-go rice. Inside, it was much worse. It was a clump of cheesecake mushed together. The lid didn't have anything on it, so obviously they just squished it into the container or something. I guess she didn't look at it until she got home.  She warned me it probably wouldn't taste good by the looks of it. Being the person I am, I wouldn't let cheesecake go to waste and just toss it. I ate the most I could of what was inside, maybe a bite or two with the spoon they gave us in the bag. I have chunks remaining and I honestly am afraid to eat the rest. Usually Applebee's is a great place, but I have no idea what they were thinking when they gave my mom this.

Kioni H.,"Oak View, CA",3,10,8,3.0,1/30/2016,"Second time here, started a weekly trend coming every Friday or Saturday since it's just a few miles up the road from my job with coworkers. Service is great and we never wait long for our order. Food is also great! The first time I had a chicken salad and shrimp pasta which is one of my faves! This time I ordered their ""All Day Burger"" which has hash towns and a fried egg which is pretty good BUT I gave them 4 stars because although it was okay it was very bland..moist but bland..like literally had no seasoning, no taste at all.... AND I ordered onion rings instead of fries and they literally gave me 5 onion rings and I'm not talking about the huge onion rings that restaurants can get away with giving 5. No their onion rings are small and to top it off have like no onion in them and were very hard, didn't taste fresh at all but they have pretty good cocktails. Last time I ordered a blackberry sangria which was pretty tasty and this time I ordered a sunset margarita which is now one of my faves and AppleBee go to's for now on. So my only complaint would be ..I wouldn't go to Apple Bees and order a burger anymore and they could be a little more satisfying with their portions although it's enough to fill me up I didn't pay for a meal for 5 small hard onion rings.

Geraldine C.,"Avondale, AZ",43,33,9,1.0,4/22/2014,"First time at a Applebee's out here in Oxnard and can I just say that it will definitely be my last. I thought it was convenient since it was right across the street from the outlets, but boy was I wrong.  First off my husband and I had to wait to get seated when there were clearly seats available. Finally after 15 minutes of waiting and bringing it to the hosts attention that there were seats available, we got seated.  Not to mention that when we got seated we had to flag down a waiter to finally get drinks ordered but by that time we already knew what we wanted. I ordered their classic cheeseburger and fries and my husband ordered their chicken strips.  We got our plates rather quickly and once we started eating we knew why. My burger was very pink in the middle and both my husbands and I's fries were cold and unseasoned.  We tried to address the waiter but he kept saying to give him a minute and that he would be back. After a few minutes and seeing him take care of a few other tables before us, we decided it was time to go. We let the host know what had happened and he let his manager know and the manager kept saying we had to pay the bill before leaving. The manager clearly didn't want anything to do with the situation and clearly just wanted to get payed. After arguing with the manager for 10 minutes my husband and I got half off our bill and we left. Very hungry and very mad.   This place is the worst. We will not be coming back.

It was none of those things which is really too bad because it looked delicious. My bad that I have no photos but I was not dining with fellow Yelpers and non-Yelpers look at me stranger than normal when photographing my entrees.  Went with the wood fired salmon, the wood fire roasted veggies, and cheese&bacon potatoes. And then we waited and waited and waited some more. Thirty minutes later our entrees arrived and one of them was wrong but the rest of us went ahead and started eating. I cut the delicious looking squash and it was not only smoke flavored but the equivalent of chewing what I can only imagine a charcoal briquette must taste like...okay that was going to take some getting used to! The salmon was lukewarm and my sad little potatoes with some sadder looking cheese and tiny brown things that could be bacon...or not.

So he ate alone and was done before we even got our meals. 2. I ordered the salmon and got a piece about half the size pictured in the menu. 3. They provide a recommended tip at increments of 15, 18, and 20% - however these tips were based on the total bill including the tax. 4. We talked to the manager about the above and although she listened attentively and commiserated she offered us nothing to compensate for our concerns.   We were a bit surprised that she didn't offer us at least a discount for our meal or a future one--less than stellar customer service.  I felt like they were really glad to see us leave.

However I've been coming to this location over the past 3 years and I think it's fair to say they've earned an honest review. I can easily give them 4 stars based in food, drinks, service, and atmosphere.  Atmosphere: 3.5-4 stars. ITS APPLEBEES, Like how much do you really expect from a chain? It's clean, plenty of seating, sports on the tvs always, and this location personalized it's decor to the city so I think that's great. Also the bar crowd isn't bad, very good vibes all around. Food: 4 stars. Obviously you get what you pay for but with that being said I always leave feeling like I had a good meal for about $10 a person, you really can't beat it. Extensive menu and the 2 for $20 is always my groups go too. My foods been correct and tastes good so no problems there. Service: 4 stars. Not many misses. This location is good with staffing and bringing your food out ASAP. Like I've said I've been coming here for about 3 years, I one point I'd come to the bar here about once a week so I feel like I have a fair say in knowing the service. For people giving low reviews about service id say they had a bad night because for how long I've been coming here it's always been pretty good. Bar area: 5 stars! Drinks are hit or miss you really just need to find what you like. Once you do though you'll be a happy camper! Great selection of beers, liquor, and plenty plenty of mixed drinks! Mojitos, long islands, margaritas! They've all been great. Plus their happy menu is out of this world, most of these drinks range between $3.50-6 you can't beat that!!!

So we spent the morning shopping at the outlet and recalled all the commercials we've been seeing advertising the burger, I mean who doesn't want a good burger. So we popped in to check it out. It was pretty packed but we were seated quickly because we didn't mind sitting in the high chairs near the bar area. The waitress came right away, Sophia, pretty, nice and super sweet. She explained that appetizers and drinks were half price (football season). We ordered the burgers straight away along with drinks. The drinks came right away but 45 minutes later came cold fries and burgers with no condiments (dry). We immediately called over the server to feel the food, my boyfriend was playing with the fries lol and she called over the manager who personally took the food back to the kitchen and they both apologized. After about fifteen or so more minutes my man was like forget it. The people next to us, who were there before us, still hadn't received their food either, so we decided to leave. He walked out and I called over the server to pay for the drinks. Soon after the manager came and told me they were comping the food, packing it up and she apologized again for the wait and the service. The two stars are for the manager and the server. I'm glad we didn't pay for the food, it wasn't good. The sweet potato fries were hot but half cooked so yuck. The burgers were bland, needed some taste. And who doesn't put mayo or mustard on a standard burger. There was no lettuce tomatoe nothing. Like I said, I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it. Should have known with a two star rating.

I arrived at 5:45 I was instantly seated which was good but we were waiting on one other person so we ordered the drinks and waited for our last guest but happy hour was about to end and we told or server to put our appetizers in. Now when she said that ""if you don't want us to put the order in right now for the appetizers you can wait until your last guest arrives and the will still be charged at happy hour price"". Ok that's great but when our guest came we put the order in and we wanted to add one more appetizer for them, the server then said that we would be charged full price. So I asked to speak to a manager which he understood quickly and that matter was resolved. When our food had came we ordered our dinner, at about 6:00, and as the other appetizers came out at about 6:15 I was thinking ok 15 minutes for our appetizers. That's ok because it's busy. Within the next forty five minutes the server came by twice both times to refill our drinks which had been empty for five minutes each time. At 6:45 we asked for the check and to just asked for the food to go because it was taking too long. I asked to speak to the manager a second time and I told him we had bee sitting down for an hour and haven't even gotten the food that we order 40 minutes ago he apologized but did nothing about it. Didn't take off a drink or the birthday dessert for my two year old she didn't get sung to or enjoy her ice cream or her corn dog. We received the food at 7:00 and the manager tried to give me a 10% off coupon but I told him I wouldn't use it because I would not be coming back.

Again, the veggies seemed like they were frozen and dethawed. They all tasted the same and not like the vegetable they were supposed to...  We had a dessert - the triple chocolate meltdown.

They are always good and that cheese sauce is so yummy! My Partner in Crime (PIC) thought the twisters should be seasoned. Being that I need to stay away from as much sodium as possible, I thought they were good plain. I mean you have that amazing cheese dip to slather them in. I was undecided on which entre' to choose. But ended up getting the Riblett Basket with the southern bbq sauce. The ribs were moist, the sauce was kinda bland, will try a different flavor next time, but definitely good. The fries were seasoned just right and were crispy on the outside and just right in the inside, u know not to dry and bountiful. My PIC got the Chicken Tenders Platter which included cole slaw and french fries. reported the slaw was crisp and fresh tasting and was on the mild side meaning it was not overwhelming. We both had the same opinion on the fries.

Custom to the normal means of hospitality, this restaurant is far below the par level.  As my patrons and I sat diligently we noticed both larger and smaller groups were seated after ourselves as they only have waited for five to ten minutes while we have sat patiently for thirty. In addition, its apparent that the bar seating area's rules can change at a moments notice with the discretion of particular servers, thusly makes the idea of ""patients is a virtue"" simply obsolete. The food has came lukewarm in multiple visits with a few entrees either cold, warm  or one actually at serving temperature. The level of customer service is a serious issue that a majority of servers must be accustomed to learn once again. The restrooms are probably cleaner than the interior and exterior of the restaurant. The only positive aspect of this location is that it is located right off the freeway.

Stacey D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,27,,2.0,9/18/2011,"Let me start by saying that I typically stay away from Applebee's because of a story I was told by a worker on things that happen ""behind the scenes"" there (this was a different location but you have to wonder).  Perhaps it's not fair of me to generalize from one story, but that's just how many of us can get when we hear something that we don't like. Anyways, I decided to give the newly-reopened Applebee's here in Camarillo a shot.  Went there on a Thursday night.  First impressions was that it looked fairly clean (but it's new afterall) and the hostess was friendly and seated us quickly.  There was just two of us and she placed us in a quieter section of the restaurant which was very thoughtful. Admittedly, service was pretty decent, but not stellar.  They were friendly and attentive.  Food didn't take long.  My son ordered a hamburger with no onion (but they still included the onion), and I got one of their 550-under entrees.  Both were pretty good. Here's what's so bad.  My plate arrived looking as though it hadn't been washed!!  UGH!!  Smears all around the food, multiple fingerprints, spots that I couldn't recognize.  It looked disgusting.  The manager said it was ""hard water spots.""  Are you serious?  I know what hard water spots look like and servers are not supposed to grip plates all over like that.  My son's plate looked better but far from spotless.  What a shame.  Decent service and food but sorry...  You bring me a plate like that and then try to run some BS by me.  Serious down grade.  Not going back.  Now I remember why don't like going to Applebee's.  Thanks for the reminder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=100

For starters, we received no welcome.  The hostess grabbed three menus and showed us to a table in the back.  Our waitress showed up 5 minutes later and we ordered a sampler appetizer.  It took nearly 20 minutes for it to come out (and mind you, there were maybe 5 other parties in the restaurant).  Our chicken wings were cold, the spinach dip seemed to be 10 parts cream to 1 part spinach, the mozzarella in the mozzarella sticks was hard and chewy, and finally the quesadillas... actually, they weren't too bad!  The queso cheese and crispy tortillas made for a tasty simple quesadilla. For our meals, we ordered turkey club sandwiches and burger sliders, all with a side of onion rings.  My friend who ordered the sliders got through 1 before she said it had such a odd taste she couldn't keep that one burger down.  My other friend and I both got the club sandwiches.  She finished hers reluctantly because we hadn't eaten all day and it was 3pm in the afternoon.  I could barely eat half of my sandwich because it was a tasteless pile of mush.  It was so drenched in sauces and slimey cold cuts you couldn't taste a thing.  And lastly, the onion rings had such an odd taste to them as well, as if they had been fried in stale oil.  Needless to say we also only received a handful of onion rings (literally, we each received 5).

Here's the good: The Hostess, The Beer, The Food Runner, The Manager. The Bad: Service was stupid slow.  It should not take 2.5-hours to eat at Applebee's. It took us 15-minutes to get the check, which was wrong and another 15-minutes to take off the two things we never ordered.  Having one bartender behind the bar is not enough to serve the bar and restaurant.  Drinks took forever.  Waitress disappeared multiple times and then she asked, ""Is something wrong?"" at the very end of our meal.  Not to mention my medium-rare (how I ordered it) steak was as chewy as taffy.  Bad grade meat (no matter what the menu says).   Needless to say, I will not be back. p.s. - Poor music choice for the restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=120

Kate F.,"Camarillo, CA",63,12,,3.0,6/27/2011,"The day my two boys have been waiting for is here...the Camarillo Applebee's has reopened under new ownership.  The outside of the building has been spruced up with new paint and new signage.  The interior has also been greatly improved with new decor that is updated, but still relevant to the community.  Where the previous owners used collages of local photos and memorabilia, the new owners have chosen photos of local landmarks and activities.  Tasteful, bright, and clean.  There are also a dozen or so well-spaced flat-screen monitors playing various sporting events. Although I'm not sure when they reopened exactly, it's clear that the restaurant is still in the infancy stages.  There were 3 times as many employees on-hand today as necessary and many of them seemed to simply be observing.  (A bit of a shame, because they could have been a shade quicker with refills, but it wasn't a big deal.)   Good news first - The kids meals were perfect. My 8-yr-old reports his chicken tenders were tasty, and not scorching hot, and only wishes restaurants wouldn't serve applesauce with an adult-sized soup spoon (but that's certainly not unique to this place). My 4-yr-old loved his corndog and fries (big surprise there), also not scorching hot. I tasted a few of his fries, and I have to agree that they were quite good. Not so good news - The ""Paradise Chicken Salad"" was a bust. The grilled chicken was tasty, but the rest of the dish was just not great. Now, I know it's supposed to be a Weight Watchers dish and to stay under 350 calories is tough, but the lack of flavor was disappointing. The bulk of the salad was romaine lettuce and shredded cabbage. There were some carrot shreds and even fewer microscopic bits of pineapple and tomato tossed in along with 4-5 mandarin orange slices, and about 5 small chunks of green apple around the edge of the plate. The menu claimed that it was tossed in a ""cool balsamic vinaigrette"" but it must have been only a few drops. The concept has potential, but not at the current ratio of ingredients. A couple last peeves - While I understand not bringing place settings for the kids, whose meals don't require silverware, at least bring a few extra napkins. And no, beverage napkins that have been catching condensation from the kids' lemonade cups aren't enough. Also, our waitress lacked some basic social skills. Speak up, look at me when you speak, and use complete sentences. (OMG - I sound like my mother!) All in all, we had  a good lunch.  The kids LOVE this place, and as any parent knows, happy kids tend to lead to more peaceful meals.  We look forward to the staff getting adjusted to serving ""real"" customers.  Lord knows we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=120

Christine K.,"Lawndale, CA",0,18,,4.0,6/24/2013,"My husband and I are regulars here (we eat here several times a week). We generally are very happy with the service and the food. Our favorites tend to be: Appetizers: Wonton Tacos - The BEST! Very flavorful and unique. Brew pub pretzels - my hubby loves these. The cheese sauce has a great beer flavor, and the pretzels are always crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. wings - tasty potato twisters - a bit hit and miss for me. It seems extremely hard for them to get these cooked so that they're crispy but not overdone. Generally, they're dark with a slightly scorched flavor, which my husband is happy with. I prefer golden brown, but it appears that if they don't overcook them, they turn up soggy in spots where they're bunched together. If they got rid of the crazy cut of the potatoes and just made them flat chips, it would cook more evenly. The cheese sticks and quesadillas are also pretty good. I find the bread for the sliders to be a little too mushy. Entrees: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Bourbon Street Steak. It's always tender and juicy and comes with a great sauce on top (ask for extra). I've tried several of their other steaks and prefer this one. The Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp was good the one time I had it, but I definitely prefer the steak. The garlic herb salmon, three cheese chicken penne, cup of tortilla soup, creamy parmesan chicken, oriental chicken salad, and riblets are all pretty good. Desserts: Brownie bite, a small brownie wedge and small scoop of ice cream with hot fudge hits the spot without too much guilt (either for the waistline or pocketbook at $1.49). The butter pecan blondie is super rich and deadly. (Though not as good as a pizookie from BJ's, it's still pretty darn good.) Hubby tried the chocolate mousse shooter last night and enjoyed it. Drinks: A little hit and miss. They do seem to hold back a little on the alcohol during happy hours. I like the fruity ones like the white peach sangria, and some of the fruity martinis. Hubby likes the house margarita and corona-rita. Check for their specials during different times and on different days. If you come often, be sure to pick up the $50 gift card that comes with a free $10 gift card (offered during limited periods of time).

The riblets are basically the rib tips/ends slowly cooked in (their?) bar-b-que sauce This is another establishment pre-Yelp that I used to rave about. Well, my tastes have somewhat matured. So, this place is just ""OK"" now. They also have a fairly good sampler platter that you can munch on while watching a game or two on the numerous tvs around the restaurant.  If you're coming for a game with your buddies, it's best to ask for a table around the bar as that's where most of the tvs are.

Sara A.,"Camarillo, CA",1,6,,1.0,1/26/2012,"I'd like to give this place a 1/2 star, if possible (I'm new on Yelp)                           First things first, we did not receive a welcome to Applebee's upon entering the restaurant. I had been wondering why I hadn't been to this Applebee's before they closed and after they had opened. Now I know why. The service is shoddy, as it took awhile to be greeted at our table. Restaurant wasn't even that busy, so I didn't understand why our server didn't greet us right away. Everyone at my table had received their drinks in a timely manner, but it took about 20 minutes to receive the water that I ordered. We had to remind the server/waiter to bring my water. As a vegetarian, there aren't that many options for one to order, especially not for the '2 for $20' deal they brag about.              Anyway, I ordered pasta from the 2 for 20 deal and asked if I could get the pasta without chicken and the server brings the food. Once he brought the food and after taking a few bites, I noticed that the pasta had bits of bacon minced into the alfredo sauce. When he brought the food, and maybe he was trying to be funny, he stated that my pasta was the way I ordered it, 'chicken and all'. Hahaha, very funny, but I didn't appreciate the sarcasm considering the fact that I was already fuming after the poor excuse for a greeting we received at the door and how long it took to be waited on and receive my water.                 After our meal, the manager came up to the table and asked how everything was and if there was anything he could do and that he had already deducted a whopping $8 from our bill. The shadiest thing is that he said we wouldn't see the deduction on the bill, we would just know that he deducted $8. Then when we received our bill, we noticed the itemized $8 deduction..Where is the consistency in his gesture? I understand he was being kind in mediating the situation, but his honesty was shady (for lack of a better word). When he asked how everything was..I stated that things were mediocre at best and the waiter should have known that there was bacon in the pasta sauce.  The server did not ask us how we were doing during our meal or if we needed anything, we had to flag him down. Meanwhile, the table next to us was receiving stellar customer service from Neil P., who knows why or how this was justified.                  Also, when Neil came around to take my picked-at salad, he didn't ask if I was done with it, he just took it without asking if I wanted a box or if I was done with my meal. At this point, I just wanted to get out of this place and go home. By the way, the waiter/server's name was Neil P. and the manager Frank Navarro was not too concerned with my overall opinion of the service (as he quickly received my answer and moved on to a different area of the restaurant) or the fact that they messed up my food order AND charged us for the salad at first, then upon noticing that I didn't eat my salad they took the charge off for the salad (nice gesture, but a little late with the customer service).                             My husband and I, plus the rest of the individuals we inform of this wondrous place are never going to return! I hope this place closes again as their food is bland, service is poor and integrity has been blown to bits. My patience was really tested in this place and I would like to think of myself as a patient and sensible individual. But.. I should have known better as this is a corporate chain which should have stayed closed! What was I thinking? Just say 'No' to Camarillo Applebee's and maybe even the other ones..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=120

Diego V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/2/2013,"I must say that I've been a fan of Applebee's for a while, service is always good but this last time I really had a bad experience, I ordered steak and it was way over cooked, Sheela (our server) quickly put a new order, a manager named Tim (supposedly a manager) took the steak to the table with some sort of apology, when I had my steak at my table another girl showed up with another steak, I was already fine with my ready to start eating and all the sudden without even asking this guy Tim took me steak and took BOTH back to the kitchen to make sure it was the right steak...are you serious?!! Anyways when he got back he had the nerve to ask me if everything was okay, I said that it was fine just for the fact that I was going to eat by myself and he said...""well at least they cooked it again for you""...I swear a couldn't believe it, I told the waitress the story in a funny way and later when I was done he came back again to ask me if I wanted to take the leftovers home...there was NOTHING to take other than pieces of grease on the plate, that's when I thought he was just making fun of us and I decided to take the time and write this for people know and hopefully management of this restaurant know how stupid this guy is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=140
Marisela A.,"ASTORIA, NY",72,45,1,4.0,7/11/2011,"We decided to stay in Camarillo and have a little summer beach weekend so when it came to dinner time we wanted to eat somewhere we knew would be a safe bet and decided to check out the local Applebee's.  We definitely made the right choice.  This location has recently reopened and the restuarant looks nice from the outside and the inside.  There's a very friendly staff and our server was great about refills and kept the beer flowing.  I ordered Margherita Chicken which came with piping hot garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  My boyfriend ordered the Asiago Peppercorn Steak and was prepared just right with plenty of spicy peppercorns for that extra kick.  We also indulged a tiny bit with the Triple Chocolate Meltdown and it was everything we had hoped a rich chocolate dessert to be.  We even saw a cute little bunny in the grass when we walked out to our car.  What else can you ask for in a restaurant?  It was a great experience and it really hit the spot.  Next time you're on the 101 and you're looking for a good place to refuel that's also open late, you won't be disappointed at this Applebee's. =D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-camarillo-2?start=140
