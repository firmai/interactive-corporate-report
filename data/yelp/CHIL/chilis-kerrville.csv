Doug W.,"Pleasanton, TX",0,3,,4.0,8/31/2017,"Great meal. Great service. My wife and I each got ""lighter choices.""  She got the Margarita chicken and I got the Ancho Salmon. Both were excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Jason L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,,1.0,12/28/2017,Chili's needs to get back to service.  Waitstaff here more interested in socializing than working.   Staff buzzed around without actually stopping at their tables.  Manager was a useless as the neon signs.    Worst margarita ever.  Bartender couldn't pour water.  Miserable.  Avoid even if you love chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Dennis B.,"Johnson City, TX",7,2,,1.0,11/22/2017,1:40 In afternoon and tables open everywhere you  look and yet the wait list is 25 minutes.   Wait staff just walking around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Mary Kathryn M.,"Houston, TX",6,77,,4.0,8/1/2016,This is your typical Chili's. The food is just as good as any other Chili's. The service is not any worse or any better than any other Chili's I have been to. What makes this place stand out is the view! Being from out of town the views are what bring me back to this place time and time again. I have the best memories of coming here a child with my family and playing out in the field until my food came. I would always catch fireflies in the early summer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Ashley S.,"Pflugerville, TX",16,257,60,3.0,1/16/2017,"The food and service is average and sane quality as others. If you enjoy their food, you'll like this place. It's a chain, of course.  *tip if you order a salad I'd recommend half the dressing they normally put on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Dillon D.,"Arlington, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/2/2017,Hands down one of the worst Chilis I have ever eaten at. Besides the terrible service working there the food has gone way down hill. Way over priced and super sloppy presentation as well as taste.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Carol M.,"Kerrville, TX",0,1,,5.0,8/26/2017,Had not been to a Chili's in years since I was living in a rural community...moved to Kerrville recently and had been installing locals restaurant's apps on phone.  Got a few coupons from Chili's decided to go for a birthday meal.  The food was amazing...steak extremely tender... vegetables cooked perfect.  The wait staff was very courteous and friendly.  Anthony was our server and he was so entertaining.  Will make this my to go place to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
John C.,"Woodville, TX",1,3,,1.0,9/28/2016,"My wife and I eat our several times a week and recently Chili's has gone down hill.  Last time we ate there the food was cold, late, service was slow and the music way too loud especially for the older crowd that frequents this place. We decided to try it again for lunch and it became apparent the place was not crowded (for a reason).  We did place our order but after 30 minutes of waiting we just left ( I left $10 on the table for the drinks). I told the receptionist about why we were leaving and she just shrugged her shoulders. I hope Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday takes this place over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Morgan H.,"Escondido, CA",4,30,5,1.0,6/5/2016,"Wow!! Let's start with that. It took 15 min for anyone to say hi to us. After we ordered, we got food in a timely manner. Then ordered a dessert....um.....how long does it take to make this dessert? Well about 20 minutes went by and a manager came by and said she just put it in, no apology. She could care less also, just like the rest of the staff. Something needs to be done about there moral. If you don't like your job, find a new one. Take pride in whatever you do, be your best always no matter what. And the very worst Chili's award goes to you Kerrville!!!  This town sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Joe H.,"Coppell, TX",2,88,,3.0,10/2/2016,Not being a big fan of Chili's in the DFW metroplex I was quite surprised by the Kerrville location. The bottomless soup and salad was tasty with a beautiful presentation. The service was super and the price is reasonable. Obviously the management of this particular Chili's needs to give lessons to most of the chain,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Hugh H.,"Kerrville, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/5/2016,"I have eaten at Chili's since I was a child in the DFW area, where Chili's started.. I have to say the new atmosphere, menu, and service is terrible. Burgers are smaller, potato buns? Really? Just not the same as I grew up, put the high school jerseys back on the wall, we don't go to Chili's for some upscale dining experience. We want a place to go eat after Friday night lights!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Chris A.,"Center Point, TX",1,27,1,4.0,10/26/2016,"It was a great night with delicious wings and good chicken tenders. One concern was that tonight, it appeared to be understaffed especially with the kind lady waiting a whole lot of tables around us. A little slow, but a good pace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Ian I.,"Kerrville, TX",0,30,,3.0,1/23/2016,"Never had an issue with the time for food even on a busy night. Tastes well, good staff. It's a pain at night to find the parking spot to pull into. I asked for a White Russian, they had to ask the bar tender if they can make one. WHAT? Don't you go to School or take a class to be a bar tender? Well I got one, wish I never asked for it. Still good food, friendly staff and a fun place to enjoy a night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
D.j. C.,"Mountain Home, TX",37,3,,5.0,9/18/2015,Always great service. And.friendly staff and management. Love the honey crispers and margarita presidente. Cold shiner on.tap.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Julian D.,"Hockley, TX",41,35,6,3.0,8/21/2015,Food takes forever and chili's always suck but this place has a chill atmosphere. Waitress was a badass chick. Will go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Annika J.,"Fredericksburg, TX",1,6,2,4.0,11/26/2013,"Despite the negative reviews, my husband and I's experience wasn't too terribly bad; our waitress Kari was very sweet and really made sure our food was good and that we were happy. The only downside for me was with the kitchen. I ordered nachos and sweet potato fries. They were both really really good but presentation was horrible at best. I didn't find any hairs or anything like that but the paper in my basket of fries was nearly off the basket and hanging out, not centered at all. And my nachos weren't in any particular order, rather the bare part of the chips facing outward, they were all strewn everywhere with many piled on one another.  I will definitely be back again, because the food and waitstaff were great- just the food presentation is a hands down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Sarah M.,"Kendall, TX",36,4,4,2.0,7/25/2013,"Awful service. Let me preface this to say that I was a server at a different Chili's, and slow service is totally unacceptable and a result of bad training on the part of the management.  Came in for lunch around 2:00, when it wasn't busy by any stretch of the imagination.  Our server had to be reminded by another server TWICE before he greeted us and took our drink orders. After that, we waited 15 minutes for him to bring us our soup, which was cold, and which we immediately sent back. Waited another 10 minutes for more soup, and my husband's came back lukewarm.  When our food arrived, it was decent - standard Chili's fare - but once again, our server had to be flagged down when we needed our check, and then again when we needed him to take it to charge our card.  I feel like, because this particular Chili's is one of the only big chain restaurants in the area and because it's on the river, they feel like they can get away with bad service. I won't be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Tracy S.,"Ingram, TX",0,2,,2.0,4/7/2016,"I give it two stars because our server was great, but we had issues with the kitchen. We had 8 people with our party one of which was a child and his food came in last. Half of our plates were cold and super greasy. Might come back more than likely not",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Chris L.,"Houston, TX",0,3,6,1.0,8/1/2015,Food takes forever to arrive and does not look like the pictures or match the description. Came twice and the experience was the same each time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Tamara S.,"Ingram, TX",37,13,,1.0,2/19/2014,"I have not been to this particular location since early October of 2011.  The only reason I went that time was because it was late, I was in Wedding Planning Hell, had just spent a day with My Mother and desperately needed a drink.  Last night, My Husband and 12 year-old Son went to dinner there.  I was pleased there was not a wait.  We were seated quickly.  I deposited my purse and headed for the restroom (FILTHY) and returned to our table to find our waiter (let's call him.... Patrick) sitting between My Husband and Son (and moments later, directly across from me).  However, he was not just sitting... He was sitting on the backrest of the chair, one foot IN the chair, and his crotch right at about eye-level.  In the South it is generally accepted for a Woman to be called ""Hon, Darlin'"" or the like --  However, when your waiter is sitting with his ass on the chair back, his crotch at eye-level and his foot about 8"" from the surface of the table, being called ""Sweetie"" just didn't give me any kind of warm feelings.  It was just plain skeezy.  We ordered our appetizers and drinks which he brought out promptly --  However, while he was obnoxiously schmoozing, he managed to dribble two of our drinks contents across the table which we cleaned up with napkins as he seemed COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS.  The food was as you would expect in a Chili's Restaurant. My Guacamole Burger had zero flavor, the meat was well-done (not medium rare), and the 'grilled' jalapenos looked and tasted as if they had come out of a can and had NEVER seen a grill.  Cold, flavorless, boring. It sat in my gut all night like a rotten, living being that refused to digest.  My Son had the 9"" Pepperoni Pizza and seemed happy enough, though I suspect part of it might have been the endless glass of Dr. Pepper that sat in front of him (and to the left of our waiter's genitals).  My Husband had the Bacon Cheeseburger which was also over-cooked.  While we were eating, two older ladies came and sat down at the table next to us.  The same waiter came to their table and stood, with his hips thrust forward and proceeded to chat them up in the same skeezy manner.  I was relieved for them that he did not 'have a seat' on their table (chair backs) as well!  I know that as a server in an eating establishment you have to put on a certain amount of charm, a bit of a show, and have a large personality if you want to make those tips!  I get that...  But this guy just came across as  plain creepy.  I'm interested in eating and having my drink kept full...  Not on what you have in your pants, Pal. My Son:  ""Please tell me we never have to come here again?""  Me:  ""No Son, never again.""  And that's WITH the endless supply of Dr. Pepper...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville
Leandra B.,"Austin, TX",176,126,102,3.0,4/5/2012,"The service is hit or miss.  My husband and I took a break from a hospital visit and sat at the outside bar for a quick drink and the server, who was standing right in front of us keying orders in didn't even acknowledge us...at all.  I had to go inside and order for ourselves and as my husband said, it was a good thing we had no intention of eating because our entire time there he never asked if we needed anything or even looked in our direction.  I heard the people sitting next to us complaining about never getting a refill on their drinks.   Sadly, this is one of the more popular restaurants in Kerrville so we ended up back there a few days later for my mother's birthday, (her pick).   The waitress was friendly and very attentive.  We had a great meal.  I guess the way to go is to walk in with very low expectations and you may be surprised, or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville?start=20
Angie O.,"Kerrville, TX",1,1,,1.0,5/1/2015,By far the worst Chili's i have ever been to. Service sux and food sux.  Every time we come  hope for a better experience and it gets worse.

Joseph S.,"Kerrville, TX",0,6,,1.0,12/3/2013,"The worst Chili's I've been to by far. Long time resident of the area and unfortunately have been familiar with it for years. Terrible service, poor and inconsistent food, dingy feeling - for those who have had a good experience there you hit the luck of the draw. As many years as it's had that reputation, it speaks of the management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville?start=20

N.C. F.,"St Petersburg, FL",0,45,27,3.0,1/22/2008,"What sets this Chili's apart from others is the location.  Adjacent to the beautiful Guadalupe River which flows through the heart of Kerrville, you can request a river-view table or, in nice weather, be seated outside and enjoy the Hill Country weather. The menu is standard Chili's, so no need to comment on that, but you're sure to enjoy the view. Note:  this Chili's is due for renovation, which is due to be completed by late spring of 2008.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kerrville?start=20
