21,Coty G.,"New Orleans, LA",25,25,52.0,5.0,2015-02-14,Came in after a quick shopping trip. Had the pleasure of being waited on by Juliette. She was amazing and very attentive. Ordered the wings for an appetizer and they were cooked to perfection. Had the mini pepperoni extreme pizza and a strawberry splash. Everything was prepared fresh and the wait wasn't long at all. This place just opened up Monday (2/9) and I will definitely be back. Be prepared for dozens of choices when you are looking at the 16 page menu. Also had the white chocolate macadamia pizookie for dessert - heavenly!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=60,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188

It can be a bit loud but that's expected. And I like their music selection.  The menu is huge. Something like 16 pages. On one side, it can be a bit overwhelming but on the other, it just means you have more options. The service is great. The servers are obviously trained to say ""my pleasure"" as opposed to ""you're welcome"" or ""no problem"" & it can come off as forced but that's only a small thing. They're knowledgeable & attentive; BJs seems to do a very good job training their employees.  The food has been good every time. Good not great. The burgers are pretty big, the pizza is always tasty, the pastas are okay, and the Pizookies are delicious! Overall, good place to meet up with friends or bring your family.

76,Ashley R.,"Slidell, LA",18,10,5.0,4.0,2015-02-22,"New restaurant. Only been open for almost a month and it's pretty good. It's been busy since it's opened. So why not try it out. I've heard nothing but good things.  We got here around 1pm and there was about a 25 mins wait. Neat how they have it set up to text you when your tables ready. We got seated and our waitress made it known that she was running behind so we kind of expected things to be a little slow. The menu is huge! Tons of variety... It was about a 10 min wait before we got our drinks and another 40 mins or so before we got an appetizer. The crispy fried artichokes are really good. I could eat them all day. My boyfriend ordered the chicken wings and he said they were just ok but agreed the artichokes were really good.  15 mins later we got our entrees. I ordered the extreme pepperoni deep dish pizza. He ordered the ribeye and we also got a chicken tender kids meal for our daughter. Everything was good. Really no complaints at all as far as the taste of the food goes.  I think Bc it's such a new restaurant for the area, the fact that it's so busy probably affects the speed of everything leaving the kitchen, but then it could have just been our waitress.

70,Kristy P.,"San Diego, CA",119,6,2.0,4.0,2015-03-09,"Brand new restaurant. There were tons of items on the menu. I ordered a Kale & Brussel Sprouts Salad. This salad includes blueberries, grapes, pepitas, cranberries, goat cheese crumbles, onions, cucumber and candied pecans. I ordered the salad with grilled shrimp on top, no pecans or cucumber, with balsamic vinaigrette. When the salad came out, it was missing pepitas, cranberries, goat cheese, onions AND the grilled shrimp. Plus, a different dressing was poured on top. Not to mention, my son's potatoes weren't sent out and our silverware was dirty. This was all very frustrating and I could tell I was about to get bitchy. HOWEVER, our server (Aaron C.), was a complete professional. He was personable and kind and actually took time to squat down next to the table to be eye to eye. He explained that the person making salads was brand new and didn't have the information needed to include the exact ingredients.  He ran around and retrieved everything that was missing. Once I had all the ingredients to my salad, it was BY FAR the BEST salad I've ever had. I will most definitely be back. Hopefully, the new restaurant kinks will be worked out soon. I'm just very very pleased with how the server diffused the situation.

94,Jessica M.,"Slidell, LA",123,97,61.0,2.0,2015-03-13,The only reason they're getting two stars is the good memories I have of the San Diego locations. This one was deplorable. We were seated and then had a 45 minute wait at the table with only water.. drinks and apps were not brought out -until we reminded them multiple times- though we ordered within 5 minutes of being seated. The managers did not even care to comp us a pizookie. I think the establishment is only going to survive on the reputation of the other locations cause one visit to this place and walking out seems logical.

I went for the Mediterranean wrap, which wasn't too bad. It wasn't really a large portion of food, but it was something that could fill you up for a few hours at the most. The server was really attentive in making sure that our drinks were constantly filled, and the highlight of the evening had to be the famous pizookie. If you're coming here with a large number of people, your best bet is to get the pizookie trio that way there's more choices in what flavors you get to try. Being on break from college for a bit, a majority of our friends decided to catch up, and this is the place we went.  The trio came out to around $9.95, and sharing it wasn't too big of a problem.

But I heard all the raves and was really hyped to try it.   They take reservations, and being new we called ahead! Got seated at the table and waited (no exaggeration here) 12 minutes for a server to even come get our drink order. When asking what alcoholic drink she suggests she is very short and leaves after suggesting two and goes to another table. Disappointing.  Ordered bar drinks & appetizers. (The pizza dip) worst appetizer I ever had. Tasted like the cheese was old. So we switched to cheese sticks, but mind you after ordering appetizers we waited 25 minutes and ordered our food. We did not, I repeat, DID NOT even get our appetizer until after we were done with our food.  So not only did it take forever to get drinks, and our server was super short with us, and our appetizer didn't come out until after our main courses, my pizza was cold because when bringing our meal the lady didn't have a pizza stand to put it on so she stood by the table with the pizza for literally 5 minutes until she could find our waitress and wave her down to signal her for a pizza stand.  It was not a very good experience. I won't be back until they work out the kinks with their kitchen and staff.

72,David L.,"Astoria, OR",87,39,2.0,2.0,2015-05-15,"Giving it two stars because it's normally great. Our most recent visit was atrocious. We got in fine, sat down at our table and ordered our drinks. I asked the waitress if I could sample a couple of beers and she said that would be fine, and we ordered our pizza and salad. About ten minutes later she arrived with two half size glasses of the beer I wanted to SAMPLE, along with a water for my wife and I. After a few minutes of talking with my wife about the size of the samples (which I did not consume), I flagged down the waitress and asked her how much they were. She informed me that they were  $4.25 per sample! I've had free samples of the beer at this facility before, and they came in large shot glass size glasses. I then flagged her down again to tell her that I didn't want to pay for those because I just wanted to SAMPLE the beer. A good waitress would have recognized her error and offered them for free, but this waitress simply took them back and poured them out. Approximately 45 minutes after we ordered our food (we noticed the time due to the text that we received before to be seated), we received our salad, and 15 minutes after that, we finally received our pizza. After we finished our pizza, she came by and offered us our first refill of water. An hour later the waitress offered us our first refill... This may have been the most frustrating thing. We noticed other waiters and waitresses servicing their tables much better and faster. It was a very frustrating experience as we were both very hungry when we arrived, and it took them an hour to get our food and first refill of water.

I'm guessing this place is new and haven't yet had their grand opening, because they have some major problems. I travel quite a bit and have been to many BJs locations across the country, never has my service been this bad. When we arrived we were told we would be seated right-away, they just had to clean a table meanwhile 15 min later we realize that there was a hostess shift change and they failed to communicate the table was for us gave it to another party that arrived after us. So 30 min. later we got a table. Then it continues with the deaf waitress (I'm only assuming because we had to repeat our order twice) seemed very unfamiliar with the menu and confused by our requests (no substitutions requested BTW). Then the kitchen is running behind and it took them another 40 min to get our food. When the food came my ""well-done"" burger came it"" medium"". Finally as we are preparing to leave they can't run my credit card because the idiot manager decided to update the computers in the middle of dinner shift. I had to sit and wait an additional 20 min. they didn't offer me anything for my inconvenience, the manager never came by to check on me, nor was he available when I asked to speak with him.

60,Elizabeth B.,"Logan, WV",1,8,16.0,2.0,2015-07-15,"The boys were excited to go here (as they are with any place that makes their own root beer); they have this place in Clearwater and Pinellas Park, Florida, so I was familiar with it. Saw three open booths and hoped we would get one, but was told they were reserved and for parties larger than our three and a child. I call BS to that because there was a couple with a small child in one of the booths, but I bit my tongue. So no booth. At least we were seated at a larger table I suppose. Our server..I'm not sure if she had never served before or if she was just on the flaky side..but I had to just laugh to myself or I was just going to get upset. We had to ask her to bring us silverware and then she only brought one set. We had to ask for drink refills...also (which I know is not the server's fault) they were out of frosted mugs for the root beer, and the cups that were used were hot which put a damper on the boys excitement. The timing of the food wasn't very good either..we got some sort of large sampler platter and we had barely started eating it and our entrees arrived. So my burger and fries were cold by the time I got to them. I had the watermelon and feta salad and it was fantastic. Nice and light and the mint was a lovely balance. I would definitely get that again. Maybe the black and blue burger would have been better if I had eaten it when it was fresh? When I got to it, the thing was a grease ball and not so good. My 4 year old enjoyed the cheese sticks from the sampler..I was told the pizza was good. I was less than impressed with the whole experience, and I know the meal wasn't cheap.

88,Buz B.,"Slidell, LA",17,128,22.0,2.0,2015-08-03,"This is a ""brewhouse"" that serves mediocre food. That's about it, really. I was excited when this place opened up, but was quite disappointed to discover that they do not brew their beer in the store, it is shipped from California or wherever. There's just something cool about a REAL brewhouse. This isn't really a brewhouse. It's a brewhouse's restaurant 1300 miles from the actual brewery. The house beers are alright, though. I like their heffewiezen. They also have a pretty good selection of the usual. I can get regular domestic or imported tap elsewhere though, so when I come here I get their house beers. I don't like the actual restaurant itself. It is entirely OPEN. No little nooks or crannies for you to lean back against and chill out in private. The store is all open and lots of completely empty space. It lacks ambiance. It lacks style and comfort. Maybe people out west like that. A bunch of non-offensive nothingness. The openness of the building is very uninviting to people who like to sit down to a nice cozy meal and a brew. Their menu LOOKS very appealing, but I've only ever had the fish and chips here because it is rather expensive. Out of the 3 times I've had their fish and chips, I was rather disappointed every time. The first time, the fish was just right, good portions and all that, but I was very turned off about those thin boring fries. Man.... screw those fries. You'd have to grab half a dozen of those dumb fries just to get a taste of potato. I was so turned off that I even left a complaint on their website. They called back and I spoke to a manager who said he was sorry that I didn't like their skinny fries, but they ""tested well"" across the country and he hoped I can get used to them. No. I won't get used to your skinny crap fries. They suck. Serve REAL fries. The other two times I got the fish and chips, the fish came out overcooked and barely any flavor. I probably won't go back there again for that. I might try something else like their cajun lasagna, though. That looked good. Their peperonni flatbread, however, is very on point, and leads me to believe that their pizza might be rockin. Speaking of rockin, you'll be rockin and rolling and slipping and sliding on those floors when you try to walk anywhere. They keep those floors so slick, it's almost as though they don't want anyone walking anywhere but to their table when they arrive and back out the door when they leave.

I don't think I'll go here very much in the future. Like I said, there is NO ambiance to this place. It's all very open and impersonal. The food I and others have had was mediocre at best.

84,Carlotta D.,"Metairie, LA",47,19,2.0,4.0,2015-09-07,"It's really interesting to read the mixed reviews. Our dining experience was great.  The wait staff was super friendly, the restaurant was very clean, and the food was very good.   There was definitely a manager on staff. He was conspicuous, prominent, and engaged.  We were very pleased with the service. Our waitress was fun, interactive, and well-informed about our expansive menu choices.  The food had a lot of flavor, even the mozzarella cheese sticks were very tasty.    The only drawback was that the hostess attempted to place us (two adults) next to a table filled with children.   When will restaurant hostesses ever figure this out?  Adults with no children do not want to sit next to other adults with children.  We opted for the bar, but in Louisiana, there's no guarantee you won't find children in a bar.   Although there are mixed reviews, 50-50 favorable and unfavorable, I think our experience goes to show that when there is a manager engaged in the daily activity, you will see substantially better service and a better quality of the final food product.  I would recommend this place and suggest that you go and check it out  before letting a few bad experiences stop you from enjoying what might be a nice treat. Ask for Nicole.   And,unless you already know what you want, don't go rushed.  The menu is quite large; it took us ten minutes to comb through everything.  P.S.  Lots of vegetarian choices too!  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.7359999999999998,3.3600000000000003

Overall, the main reason I'm giving this restaurant only two stars is because of one thing-satisfaction when it comes to food. With almost everyone on our table not being able to finish our food... it was just too bland-literally everything we had ordered there. Even the ahi poke dish was a disappointment with it's portion size. The pizzas, both that we ordered-tasted like it had no tomato/marinara sauce underneath the cheesy texture. The pasta was downright bland and had no flavor, possibly needed more seasoning. The clam chowder in the bread bowl? Nope. When it came out the bread seemed cold and every part of it was soggy. If it had just came out of the oven to be set out to eat, it's reasonable to say at least some parts of the bread would not come out soggy... it literally tasted like the entire bread bowl was soaked in water for an hour.

It has a big menu, and can be overwhelming. We have never really had anything bad, most dishes are above average, especially the burgers. Then one night, I ordered the club sandwich and everything changed and now I'm writing a yelp review. So my advice? Don't get distracted. Get the club sandwich. Then, if you are not satisfied, go ahead and get the brisket bacon burger. Its got brisket AND bacon.

At this particular location, the soup is never hot. Their clam chowder soup is just canned soup.

It IS a chain restaurant so I shouldn't be surprised but there are so many other complaints (lol). Especially with their basic salads like with their chicken tender salad (whatever they wanna call that) the lettuce is majorly chopped up in bits and they only put 3 or 4 chicken tenders on it and wanna charge you $15 for it.... why???
