46,Rachel I.,"Burlington, WI",7,45,1.0,2.0,2012-02-06,"I hate coming to this location. We have been here a handful of times (since July till now) and if it wasn't for it being dinner time (= traffic), we would go to the Allen location. All but the last time, the place was dirty and the servers sucked. Each time I told my husband I didn't want to come back and so we finally tried Applebees which is next door to Chili's. MUCH better experience there. We only went back to Chili's this last time because I was given a gift card. The last experience was actually pretty good. The server, Erica, was great and the manager walking around (a blonde older woman, cannot remember her name) was very nice. We got the Chicken Crispers original and the chicken was very spongy and gross. The manager brought us the crispy Crispers and they were much better. Erica offered to take one of our meals off the bill, but we were not telling her they sucked for that reason. I had eaten almost all of it until I couldn't take another bite for fear of throwing it back up due to how gross it was. I only told her my complaint as I thought it might be the brand of chicken (I've had spongy chicken with certain brands)... Apparently it's just how it's cooked when it's the Original. My husband only ate one or two of the Original ones but did eat up the Crispy ones.   In the end, despite another ""bad"" experience at this location, Erica and the manager saved it. We normally do not get that meal at Chili's, so I'm not going to hold it against them. Since we had a much better experience w/ the staff that day, perhaps we'll be back instead of going to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney?start=40,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001
41,Ms M.,"Fort Bragg, NC",54,117,19.0,2.0,2013-01-01,"For some reason, I remember Chili's being good in the 90's. Either I was too young to know good food, or they have gone down hill.  This location depresses me. It needs to be remodeled. I kept expecting the 90's cast from Friend's to pop out and sing ""I'll be there for you."" I don't think it has been remodeled since before Ross and Rachel got together. The food hasn't upgraded itself either from the 90's. The chicken fingers are mostly fried breading. The fries are covered in so much salt, you may need to chug a lot of those mugs of water. The staff is young, maybe too young to be waiting on tables, as they seem spacey. I did get a good burger one time. I picked it up, and saved myself from eating inside. That was a good burger! There is a Raising Cane's chicken fingers going in right in front of this location. This is the most exciting food news to happen on that entire street corner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney?start=40,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864

34,Heather D.,"Anna, TX",0,9,7.0,1.0,2014-03-24,"The last few times we have been here the service has been less than satisfactory all-around. We have been twice in the past month and at least one of our food orders was wrong each time. We asked for extra ranch or cheese when the meal was served, but it was never brought to us. I feel that the wait staff may be waiting too many tables at once. On our most recent dine-in, our waitress was at our table maybe five times the entire night. She seemed to appear when the manager was waiting on us or someone else was bringing out our food and drink refills. It took so long for someone to bring us our food it was cold! When she picked up our plates, after we were done eating, we sat at our table for fifteen minutes waiting for her to come back. She never asked us if we were ready for the check or wanted dessert when she cleared our table.

We were seated promptly but then didn't get noticed by our waiter for about 10 min. The service was pretty bad throughout dinner. Ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and got the standard wattery chilis salsa and cold chips. Two kids ordered kids cheeseburgers and fries which they said was good. Two adults ordered two different burgers and fries which were both tasty as well. I actually substituted a beef patty for a turkey patty which was nice. The bartender is on point with the long island ice teas. We still give them one star due to lack of menu knowledge and poor poor server/customer service skills.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney?start=20,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

We first started with the queso because,  I am addicted.  I need an intervention.  I think they may put crack in to to make you keep coming back.  I can't go in without eating it.  Did I mention I love the queso? I don't know how they do it, but is is literally chili meat with cheese dip.  It comes in a cute cast iron skillet that is convenient for me to lick clean.    Ok, onto the food.  I ordered the soup and salad.  I know boring, but I did just eat the queso so I have to eat a healthy dinner.  The chicken enchilada soup is AWESOME!  I get it without pico, so just be warned it doesn't say it on the menu, but they put pico de gallo on top.  I like the house salad with ranch dressing.  The ranch tastes homemade.   The waitress was friendly. Please note they have a very convenient togo area.  You just pull up to a stand and they come out to your car.  You know for those queso emergencies and you are craving it and you need it right now, but you don't want to go inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032

2,Tressette S.,"Frisco, TX",129,23,68.0,4.0,2017-09-01,"We have an awesome waiter named Bo.  This place was packed.  Although the wait was 30 minutes, no fuss here since we're hanging out on a Friday with the fam.  About to grub on various delicacies....Let's go.  Our waiter kept the drinks coming without request.  Only gripe was the place was too cold and the salsa wasn't that great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
20,Ardra M.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,,1.0,2017-09-04,I have been here several times and there's many tables available yet they won't seat us.  They say it will be a 15 min. wait.  Not good customer service at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

1,Tonia M.,"Dallas, TX",16,4,,1.0,2017-10-04,We've given this place 3 tries over the last year and have been disappointed every time.  The first visit took over an hour to get food then the food was cold. It was a random Thursday night around 5pm so the place was practically empty. No reason to wait an hour then get cold food. About 2 months ago we went for dinner with our 4 year old. They brought out her food and said ours would be put in less than 5 minutes. 20 minutes later we get our food. My chicken was raw. Sent it back and just asked for a burger since I thought it might be quicker (and didn't want to chance raw chicken again). They brought me a burger ... completely raw!  Tonight I went with my 4 year old. They said they had burned her pizza and needed a few minutes  to make another. 5 minutes later they delivered a half frozen pizza and my salad with raw chicken. Just stay away ... maybe they'll close and we'll get a restaurant that knows how to properly cook food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
0,Kacey R.,"McKinney, TX",113,190,265.0,3.0,2017-10-19,"It's Chili's... I mean, that's how I'm starting my review. You can't have super high expectations for the place, but it still gets the job done. I've been coming here for years though (not often, but every now and then). The food is always good. Last time I went, I had their chicken enchilada soup. I've had it before, and it's pretty tasty. You know the go to is Chicken Crispers and their queso which is money. Trying to be ""healthy"", I stuck with the soup on this trip. Our service was very good. We sat in the bar area, and it was pleasant. Had a little issue with the bill being incorrect, but our server got it taken care of quickly. One interesting note, we didn't have cable at the time of the past Presidential Election. We drove around trying to find a spot to watch it. Came to this location, and the bartender said they were not showing it because they didn't want there to be any trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
3,Rebecca B.,"Washington, DC",35,164,81.0,2.0,2017-11-27,"Service was awful but I feel like they were extremely understaffed on this particular day. The Deep Eddy's lemonade was delicious, though it took about 20 minutes to get my drink in. I ordered the soup as not much else on the menu is gluten free. My housemate ordered a giant burger which did not come with fries until about 15 minutes after she finished her hamburger. I feel pretty bad as this place was busy and there were only two servers, but I feel as if restaurants should account for these kinds of incidents. I gave an extra star because the manager came by and apologized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
4,Tandy J.,"McKinney, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-01,This is the worst restaurant ever i waited 20 minutes on hold to order food and they never came back to the phone. So i went in because it's on my way home and it took me standing in the to go line alone six minutes before they said someone will be right with you and took him another 3 before he took my order. As i was ordering he when in the back for at least 2 more minutes so i left and i will never return. They always have poor customer service. I'm not giving them anymore chances.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
7,Shelly K.,"McKinney, TX",38,4,,2.0,2017-12-04,"It took forever for the front person to even show up to take our name. He was walking so slow that I saw 3 other groups walk out in frustration. On a Monday night, they had ""run out"" of chips. They were then ""having problems with the fried foods"" which resulted in us not getting the fried pickles that we ordered in lieu of the chips and queso. When our burgers arrived, the fries were missing. When they were finally done, they were nice, hot, and crispy.  While our waiter was friendly and apologetic, the rest of the experience was definitely subpar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
