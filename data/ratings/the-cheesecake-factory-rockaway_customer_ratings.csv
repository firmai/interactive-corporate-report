3,Bill M.,"Dover, NJ",344,166,568.0,5.0,2017-12-19,"Finally The Cheesecake Factory is open in the Rockaway Mall bringing with them the largest menu on the Planet full of Amazing dishes and phenomenal one of a kind specialties.   I have been waiting months for this day to get here. Was it worth the wait Bill you ask??..... . ..  Yeah it was !!   (sorry my mouth was full)   So for my initial visit I went with the Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic and it did not disappoint. With every scrumptious bite I discovered ingredients like ; mushrooms, peas, garlic, bacon, and sun dried tomatoes smothered in a delicious cream sauce that was out of this world.   They also have three varieties of unsweetened tea, I had the tropical that had a hint of passion fruit, they offer sweet teas as well of course but why go there. Mint was another choice and regular tea I think was another choice, but they had me at tropical and it was Great.   My server Marisela couldn't have been sweeter, she was even sweeter than the Cheesecake, lol. ah and the Cheesecake that I chose was the Chocolate Hazelnut Nutella Crunch which was truly a delicious experience and the reason that I came here in the first place. Me and about 400 other Cheesecake fans.  You know that I'll be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
16,Mary S.,"Mendham, NJ",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-20,"Went here today, our waitress (Nycid) was amazing and so polite. Our food took almost 2 hours to come out and when It did It wasn't even that good. The manager came over a number of times to apologize, I expected him to take care of some of our meal, he took off one $9.00 item. Our check was still around $30.00. Great service but other than that me and my guest had a poor experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
2,Bob C.,"Rockaway, NJ",0,9,2.0,5.0,2017-12-20,"So today is the official opening of the Rockaway Cheesecake Factory.  All schools and government offices have shut down in honor of this momentous occasion the Township has eagerly anticipating for months.  Had the honor of witnessing Jay Z and Beyonce conduct the ribbon cutting ceremony at 11:30.  The Blue Angels aerial show was pretty cool, too. So we started with the the Ahi Tartar ad an appetizer.  It was fantastic... I really recommend it.  It's very light and flavorful. As we were just having lunch, we didn't get fancy on the entrees.  I had the Americana burger and Nancy had the Roasted Pear flatbread. Nancy says the combination pear, arugula, and gorgonzola was exquisite and reminded her of some of the meals she had whilst touring wine country out in Napa. Nancy told me to delete that and to say the flatbread ""Came out as expexted""... but I can read between the lines. My burger came out rare, when I ordered medium.  However, it was taken care if quickly and professionally.  My burger was a touch salty, but everyone was so nice, I didn't want to take off a star. This place is going to be a hit no matter what, but it's off to really good start. Welcome to the neighborhood!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
12,Katelyn C.,"Rockaway, NJ",266,7,1.0,5.0,2017-12-21,"Hostesses were friendly and accurate on their wait time despite being totally swamped by hungry guests. Service was amazing, our sever was incredibly attentive and friendly. Our food took (what they thought) was a long time to come out, but I wasn't bothered nor did I think anything was taking too long. Regardless, a manager came over and apologized. My boyfriend had a club soda and was offered a refill before he even finished his first glass. Overall great first impression, definitely on par with this chain restaurant's reputation for attentive service. Will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
11,Bill F.,"Randolph, NJ",42,13,,4.0,2017-12-21,"Food was great, but it seemed like many of the servers were still training, hence the service was very slow. Hopefully it will improve after the holidays, because we'd like to go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
0,Robert N.,"Naples, FL",14,285,108.0,5.0,2017-12-23,"A great place for lots of food made from scratch.  Although not the cheapest around, you get your money's worth. Is it five stars?  Nope.  Probably four stars.  Added another star to offset those unreasonable enough to give one or two stars for service hiccups on the first day they're open.  What did you really expect?  They have lines out the door and it's their first day on the job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
14,Ashley N.,"Dover, NJ",235,3,,5.0,2017-12-23,"Excellent service , thought it was slow from their new opening (and the chaos of all new staff) the servers and managers made me feel welcome and kept my belly full with fresh bread, delicious food and beverages, and a smile at all times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
10,Tony R.,"Andover, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-27,"1:40 minute wait, to not have 2 of the three drinks requested  Then out of 2 of the four appetizers Cancel dinner request.  Not ready to handle the rush  Could have told people before waiting  Poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
19,Sharron S.,"Stanhope, NJ",0,3,4.0,3.0,2017-12-27,"Wait was pretty long (90 minutes) as expected being opening week during school break. Waitress was really nice. Table was dirty when we sat down, my daughters silverware was filthy and had to be returned. Kitchen was really behind so appetizers came out the same time as main course (about 40 minutes after sitting). This happened to the people next to us as well. Ordered dessert to go and waited an abnormally amount of time as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
13,Giovanna V.,"Rockaway, NJ",0,5,1.0,4.0,2017-12-28,"AMAZING food, but be prepared for a long wait as they are still new! I got the Almond Crusted Salmon the first time i went and it was really great. the salad it was on was very different tasting but i loved it! It had kale quinoa and other stuff i'm not sure but it had a hint of lemon which was great. The second time i went i got the pasta di vinci which was also amazing. totally recommend that or the chicken madeira was great, my date got that. i tried it and the sauce it was in was amazing, it kind of reminded me of chicken marsala but 10x better. I loved the cheesecake also! But be prepared for a long wait- and MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!! or else you will wait forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
1,Pam T.,"Belleville, NJ",13,1,,1.0,2017-12-28,"You need to train your front line staff in service recovery, specifically 2 young women hostesses working Thursday, Dec 28 at 8pm We were given an 1hr. and 45 minute wait, came back after 1hr and 15 minutes because we noticed that there were many empty tables.   The hostess made it clear that she had no intention of seating us any earlier because the restaurant was not equipped to manage it.  She then warned us about how much worse the wait was going to get if she seated people in all of the empty tables.  Thanks for the warning...we will not be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
18,Ari L.,"New York, NY",1,24,14.0,3.0,2017-12-30,"I've been to plenty of other Locations so it is nothing new to me and I know what to expect.. let's start with me walking to the hostess stand first of all I'm standing in front of the hostess not only did she not GREET me which is her JOB but after asking how long she didn't even try to acknowledge putting my name down she basically just turned away I had to ask to put my name down. After waiting for 1 1/2 Hours to be sat I had to wait another 10 mins to be greeted by my server, after getting bread we had asked her for more butter.. not only did she return WITHOUT it she said ""were you able to make it work or did you still need more butter"" what in the world? Not to mention she put in my husbands order wrong he ordered the chicken Marsala and got the chicken Madeira, he didn't mention it because he said it was good so he didn't mind. But boy oh boy do you need to hire ""EXPERIENCED"" staff, it seems like you just hired anyone off the street and I get it you're a franchise so you probably won't care because people are gonna come in regardless because of who you are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
5,Nicole M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",84,91,12.0,4.0,2018-01-03,My family and I came here for dinner on Christmas Eve so luckily there was no wait for dinner as we planned to see a movie afterwards. The service was pretty great considering they had just opened earlier in the week. We have been to the Cheesecake Factory before so knew about the large menu and portion sizes. The food was pretty good and I especially enjoyed the drinks and dulce de leche cheesecake. I can't wait to return once it gets less busy for another great meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
4,Kristin F.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",101,85,70.0,3.0,2018-01-03,The new Cheesecake Factory in the Rockaway Mall looks fantastic! I went for an early dinner with my friend and the line to just put a name down for a table was to the door on both entrances! It was insane! We walked through the restaurant and saw so many empty tables and realized they must be short staffed. We finally just sat at the bar because they still serve their full menu there. I ordered the Ahi Tartare which was raw tuna on top of a mini avocado tower with ginger soy sauce. It was delicious! I ordered the Carne Asada Steak Medallions with a side of rice and feta corn. That was delicious as well! The steak was more done than I asked for but it was still good and very flavorful. The entrees took about 40 minutes to come out. I give 4 stars to the food but 3 stars to the slow service. Maybe when they hire more people and move a little faster will I update my review.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
15,James C.,"Wharton, NJ",0,1,1.0,2.0,2018-01-04,"It took me little over an hour to get seated.  But long wait time isn't the reason why I'm giving it two stars.  Hostess did let me know it was going to be over an hour wait so it was expected.  However what I was disappointed with was my meatloaf dish.  The sides of corn and mashed potatoes were excellent.  But meatloaf was cold inside.  When the waiter asked how my food was, I mention my cold meatloaf.  He talked to his manager and had my dish reheated.  My two sides came back steaming hot and my meatloaf, a tad bit warmer than before.  Perhaps the chefs are unable to spend the time needed to cook to perfection as the restaurant has been packed since it's opening last month.  It surely didn't meet my expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
8,Mike D.,"Milford, PA",0,5,,1.0,2018-01-06,"Arrived on Saturday evening at 445 pm to a very long line at the front desk. We were a party of 5. The hostess informed us of a 75-90 minute wait. We took the buzzer and returned around 75 minutes later. We continued to wait, at around 90 minutes a host came outside and said their reservation system was malfunctioning. He took our number and said we should be seated shortly. As we continued to wait, we noticed several open tables and it appeared they were struggling to keep up with a short staff. The atmosphere was chaotic and unruly. Every time we asked the host for an update they seemed to be annoyed and just said over and over you should be seated soon. They need more training! We were finally seated just over 120 minutes. Order was placed at 700 pm, bread arrived at 710 pm. Meals arrived at 745 pm.  I have eaten at other Cheesecake Factory sites before and never seen this type of disorganization. Also, their food is not the greatest out there. While they have a large varied menu, the food is average in comparison to other chain restaurants. So we waited like dopes for over two hours to dine on OVERPRICED mediocre food. For the prices they charge you figure they would offer free WIFI, nope! We should of just hit the food court and saved three hours of our lives, oh well. Lesson learned... If you arrive here and see a long line, STAY AWAY, FAR FAR AWAY or enjoy the long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
7,Kendra K.,"Randolph, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-13,"My husband and I visited last night. I must say this location sucks. I know they are new but they need someone from the short hills or willowbrook location to show them how it's done. Service was extremely slow and we only ordered 3 appetizers!!! I can't imagine how long it would've taken if we ordered entrees as well. I'll take the drive to the other locations, not worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
17,Chloe A.,"Morristown, NJ",0,6,7.0,2.0,2018-01-13,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but this new location in Rockaway has horrible staff. My friend and I went on a Wednesday afternoon at 3:20. We were seated right away because it wasn't busy at all. You'd think since they weren't busy the service would be fast, not at all. We waited 15 minutes or more for a waiter to come at least introduce themselves but I had no sight of who my waiter even was so I went up to the hostess and told them the situation and soon enough a waiter came but quickly reassured us that she would not be our waiter, that our waiter was on the phone. The phone really. She did take our drinks down. When our drinks came that same waiter took out order because our ""real waiter"" still wasn't ready. A few minutes later our real waiter came I believe her name was Tiffany but I don't quite remember. She then asked if we wanted bread, obviously we wanted bread that should come automatically like all Cheesecake Factorys they don't even ask. So she brought out the bread right when our food came and they messed up my order of course. They apologize and said it would be 10-12 minutes. The food was all good but the staff really needs to step it up and I still had to pay for my meal even though they messed it up I would think they at least take it off because I only ordered an appetizer which was only $7.50 and they brought me out pasta. I mainly came for the desert. It was just a very bad experience and sadly I was so excited for this location to open but I will not be going back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
6,Gerri L.,"Denville, NJ",0,60,,4.0,2018-01-14,"Enjoyed a delicious lunch yesterday.  It was a Saturday at noon and we were immediately seated.  The hostess, waitress and runner were all very friendly and attentive.  Delicious food as always with Cheesecake Factory.  If there were some growing pains when they first opened, all seems to be running well now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
9,Ellen S.,"Hackettstown, NJ",0,2,,4.0,2018-01-14,"Food was great,  our waiter was nice,  the service was slow though. I would go back but maybe call to see if there is a wait before heading out. Cheesecake was delicious as always.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-rockaway,,,,,
