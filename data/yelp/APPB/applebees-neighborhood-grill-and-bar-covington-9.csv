Denny C.,"Puyallup, WA",14,50,34,2.0,5/27/2015,"One positive about Applebee's is the prices are fairly reasonable.  I'd say if you're out for a late night snack and a cold beer it might be worthy of visiting but I'm not impressed with the food.  It seems to be clean and staff is fairly friendly but again the food is not that good. It doesn't matter what Applebee's I visit or how many times I keep giving then another chance, never leave impressed with the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=20
Ko T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",52,152,496,3.0,1/27/2013,"FOOD AND DRINK Ordered Bourbon black and bleu burger with mayo and no pink; and raspberry iced tea. Burger was perfectly cooked (see my photo). Fries were seasoned just right.  My iced tea was so-so. I wish they would add a little bit more raspberry syrup or whatever they use to flavor the iced tea. SERVICE My waitress was friendly, but she tends to enjoy talking to her coworkers more than to check on her customers. After she delivered my food, she never came back to check on my food or my drink. I would have understood if she was busy with other customers, but there were not a lot of customers. She was chatting with her coworkers and helping them roll utensils in napkins on the other side of the bar area. Meanwhile, here I was having to eat and finish my burger with an empty drink. Not cool! When she finally came to my table (after I was done eating several minutes later), she did offer and got me a refill. It would have been better if I had my refill while I was eating and not afterwards. MISC Free wifi. In the bar area, the tables on the left side has access to power outlets. I thought that was a good idea. CONCLUSION I gave three stars for food, free wifi and available power outlets. I took away two stars for the lack of service and not so good raspberry iced tea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=20
Rob F.,"Kent, WA",37,103,,4.0,10/23/2014,"I have visited Applebees in Covington several times over the years.  Typical comfort food, however, Applebees has introduced low calorie meals recently.  The food is very consistant in quanity and quality. The wait staff is overwelmed sometimes so they can be a bit slow to take your order/serve you from time to time.  Most of the time, you get a good to great server that takes good care of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=20
Sylvia M.,"Auburn, WA",58,120,,5.0,12/25/2014,"I wanted to update my review because we have always had good service here, but last night was superb.  No loud music and the guy who was managing has been there for awhile and he is fantastic!  I did not see his name tag but it was busy last night.  I constantly saw him out in the dining area conversing with customers in a friendly manner as well as helping deliver food.  I am sure that's the reason the Covington location is better than Auburn.  Management is fantastic!  Also our server was great as well.  She was very attentive and our food came out quickly and we got our normal Applebee's sized portions.  I say this because at Auburn you get half the amount.  Even though I live in Auburn, definitely worth a bit more of a drive to Covington.  Better service, better management, consistent portion size, good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=20

Jeffeory G.,"Tacoma, WA",0,4,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  I guess Applebee's has decided to cut their portions sizes to, lets just say more than, half sized.  All the photos on the menu appear the same except in the fine print the calories are smaller.  The cup of soup is under 3oz served for $4.00 no roll, and things like tortillas for the French onion are at request for an additional .50 each.  I had been a customer of Applebee's for years and have come to expect salads large enough to split easily.  Well we ordered the Thai Shrimp chicken salad, missing the 310 calorie fine print and asked to split it.  The waitress said nothing. She did not make any suggestion or ask us if it would be enough.  The waitress comes to our table caring two plates in two separate hands and places them in front of each of us. I looked down and thought that's a bit stingy for half a salad, not looking at the other plate.  I think to my self well I guess they split them already, okay I guess.  Then I look up and my table mate is looking at me impatiently, As I see her bowl is completely empty.  These were gigantic 16"" salad bowls that were 6"" deep and there was 4"" of salad, only 1/2"" deep, there was like 4 leafs of lettuce, that's it.  When waitress brings us the check and asked us is everything okay.  We start to pay and she seeing the look on our faces without a word goes and get the manager.  Apologies and excuses all the way around, manager took the 11.00 4oz salad off the check.  The Thai shrimp salad ends up being 3 oz of shrimp and crispy noodles with 1 oz of lettuce for 10.69 plus tax.  If this is Weight Watcher's ides portion control your going to starve to death.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=20

I am a Good cook, I know what a steak is supposed to look like, the second one they sent out was ridiculously raw!!!!

He was fully aware of the situation as it was happening!!! He even admitted that to me on the phone that he was aware of he situation ...

Dign G.,"Seattle, WA",132,27,200,4.0,12/2/2017,"Place has a few bad reviews & 3 star rating but I had a pleasant experience overall. The food was good and the price was decent. The staff was very nice and polite.  SERVICE: Came when it looked pack but were seated in about 5 mins despite the hostess saying the wait would be about 10-15 mins. Servers were very kind and patient -- we ended up changing our order and they were flexible. Gave no attitude. Manager also came out. Served and greeted a few tables. It was very nice.  MAIN:  My boyfriend and I ordered the 6oz. And 8oz steaks. The steaks were cooked evenly and accordingly to what we had requested. They both tasted good. The broccoli on the side were a little overcooked so there was no crunch to them.  SIDES: They actually brought me the loaded potato casserole bake instead of my mashed potatoes. They fixed it quickly and brought me the right side in less than 2 minutes. The loaded garlic mashed potatoes were good though. There were at least 3 scoops of mashed potatoes -- couldn't finish it all. Boyfriend's twisted tots were cooked nicely and none of them fell apart. The mozzarella sticks were like standard mozzarella sticks, cheesy.  DESSERT: Got the brownie bite. Came with vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce drizzled on it. Brownie was warm and melted in your mouth. Very chocolatey. Good balance with the vanilla ice cream",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9

Rich H.,"Kent, WA",8,14,3,4.0,1/22/2009,"This was our first visit to any Applebee's, ever.  I must say it was a very pleasant experience.  As usual, we went early, around 4 PM on a Thursday.  The restaurant wasn't busy. Our server was Cherie and since things were rather quiet she was able to attend to us easily but not too often, so her timing was just right. We went to Applebee's to try out their Weight Watchers menu items.  By the way, you might think that the portions would be unusually small but that was not the case.  However, if you are eager for a 16oz steak than my dinner was under weight.   We started out with Onion Soup au Gratin.  This was very good.  It rated a 4 out of 5. As main courses, we had the Garlic Herb Chicken and the Steak with Portobellos.  I am the portobello fan, so that was my entree.  Here is where the steak size mattered, it was only 4 ounces. It was cooked exactly as requested and surprisingly was more than enough after the onion soup.  The garlic herb chicken was a larger portion and my wife was not able to finish her entire entree. Both entrees came with ample portions of steamed broccoli and herbed potatoes.  Each entree gets 4 out of 5. They dropped down 1 because the chicken could have been a bit more ""herby"" and the sauce on the steak could have been a little less salty.  We consider these very minor issues. We finished off the meal with coffee and the chocolate raspberry layer cake.  The cake had been taken off the main menu, but our waitress discovered that it was still available.  Speaking of our waitress, she was very, very good.  As mentioned earlier she attended to our needs and several moments reminded us of Roy's in Hawaii, where she came by and cleared away empty sweetener packets, filled glasses, etc. with the stealth of an experienced server.  Earning positive points with each visit to our table.  She gets a 5 out of 5. The atmosphere was quiet and the decor is sports themed.  The seating area surrounds the bar and each are open to the other, so that if the bar was crowded, the noise level might be an issue.  However, it was not a problem with our visit.  There is sports memorabilia literally everywhere along with numerous TVs strategically placed so that everyone has a clear view.  This isn't important to us and they were not distracting. Cost was very reasonable and we will definitely return. Update:  I forgot to mention that the music at this Applebee's was just right for us, a mix of new and old.   For folks using Weight Watchers, Applebee's listed all the nutritional values for their menu items.  This makes it easy to make good choices and be a bit more adventurous when reaching the dreaded dessert menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=40
Jenny D.,"Kent, WA",52,13,,2.0,11/17/2010,"I unfortunately keep giving Applebees a chance every couple years or so and get disappointed each time. Their food continues to taste like something that has been previously frozen and is bland. No more chances, I'm done!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=40

Kay S.,"Kent, WA",3,22,9,2.0,5/2/2012,"Tried this place for the first time.  I ordered pasta and got a huge bite of cold sauce!  I had to spit it back onto my plate.  The chicken on my pasta was extremely dry. The staff did correct my meal and brought me dessert.  So, I'm glad that they tried to fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=40

Dave K.,"Auburn, WA",1,80,2,4.0,8/4/2010,"Dropped in after golf. Quickly seated, very polite and helpful wait staff,and good food - we had the 3-appetizer (both of us) plates. I recommend the Won Ton Tacos - they're great! A little slow coming out, but worth the wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=40
Carolyn H.,"Kent, WA",0,21,1,4.0,5/18/2010,"Applebees is pretty consistent with their food and with their staff.  They are always courteous and the food comes within a decent amount of time.  With a 3 year old and a newborn, this place is pretty family friendly.  We usually go for their breakfast which is served on Saturday and Sunday mornings (but they don't open till 10 so if you are an early riser this may not work for you.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=40
Burger T.,"Auburn, WA",5,28,,2.0,8/20/2009,"This is a review of their A-1 Burger, it was part of their 2 for 20 deal and I thought I would give it a try. Lack of Bacon was disappointing, but I knew going in that it would be missing unless I paid extra, steak sauce, barely saw it or tasted it. Onion straws? It was a few pieces of grilled onion. The burger and bun were fine, even good, but the experienced billed wasn't what I got, just stick with a more basic burger if you go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-covington-9?start=40
