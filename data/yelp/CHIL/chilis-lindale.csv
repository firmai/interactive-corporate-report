Zarquala M.,"Tyler, TX",0,40,67,4.0,8/11/2017,Chilis is a staple in casual restaurants. Prices are steadily climbing and this may be due to economy or trying to stay profitable. A ribeye is almost $18. The food is a mixture of American and Mexican. The menu has changed over the years to include lots more items like tacos and enchiladas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Scotti S.,"Lindale, TX",57,6,,2.0,12/10/2017,Food is always brought out wrong or cold. The wait staff tries but the kitchen staff hinders then. The hostesses are always young high school girls that are more concerned with talking and hanging out then greeting and actually getting people seated. We only go here for the drinks at the bar and maybe an appetizer,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Alicia M.,"Irving, TX",72,3,,2.0,6/4/2017,"I went there two nights in a row & both nights I got a grumpy waiter/waitress. Not very friendly & definitely not attentive.  Also, I only ordered guacamole & it came out brown as brown can get.  Pretty disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Kay H.,"Granbury, TX",0,5,,5.0,10/23/2017,"We just did take out tonight, but Joshua took my order which was a little complicated. He deserves an at-a-boy. He asked specific questions about my order, checked the order before pickup and when I arrived rechecked every thing with me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Jerry L.,"Metairie, LA",4,70,28,4.0,1/20/2017,Chili's has always got a good menu and the food is good.  The staff at this particular Chili's is always very friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Lori H.,"Chico, CA",1,71,99,5.0,6/5/2017,"The manager, Gary  and Cynthia, our waitress, go overboard. We had undercooked salmon and they worked overboard to make it right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
T M.,"Lindale, TX",0,6,,2.0,5/3/2017,"The quality of food AND the service is Hit or Miss.  Love Chilis but not this one!!  Slow service most of the time but not always.  I've had servers ask me to give them HIGH scores on the survey when they see I am using the kiosk at the table, I was appalled!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Barbara K.,"Mineola, TX",22,2,1,3.0,6/7/2016,I can't believe some of the things they've removed from their menu.  Someone is not using their brains.  Ribs are still good though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Kiara M.,"San Diego, CA",8,14,10,5.0,4/15/2016,Thank you Katie Mac for the best service I have ever had. My family and I were having a horrible night and you turned it around with your fun personality! Awesome service! Awesome steak! Awesome Margaritas! Thank you for showing us Cali people some southern hospitality! I'd come back to Texas to eat at this chiles!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Patti L.,"Tyler, TX",0,4,,4.0,9/8/2015,"This particular location changed my mind about Chili's - the service here, from seating to settling the bill, was far superior to another of their locations in nearby Tyler and the manager is very pleasant and available if needed for the smallest thing.  The food was also well-prepared and delivered quickly.  We tend to arrive a little off-peak because they are a very busy location being so close to the interstate.  Not a big fan of the little electronic devices (prefer the personal service) but that was no problem for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Todd S.,"Tyler, TX",58,298,211,2.0,6/18/2013,"I like Chilis. It's usually safe and reliable. What I hate are the tiny ""small town"" locations. Always a long wait, and the bar here gets full and seats about 5 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Christiana S.,"Trinity, TX",0,7,,3.0,8/31/2014,The food was good I had to send my food back because there was hair in it. The manager was nice and comped my meal and promptly got me another plate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Marjorie G.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,,3.0,7/31/2011,"Ate here last night while visiting friends in the area. We were seated with no problems, our waitress was attentive, our service quick and the food cooked correctly. Those of us with free refills had new cups placed in front of us at just the right time, not when we still had half to go, and we never had to wait. Not only that, she was unobtrusive, did not disrupt our conversation, and generally provided what we needed and otherwise left us alone.  Much appreciated!   With the food, well, it's Chilis, so as far as food from Chilis goes, it was good.  My only complaint is that the tables were squeezed very close together, making maneuvering a bit harder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
Kayla V.,"Mineola, TX",21,8,4,2.0,9/21/2013,I usually come here with family on Friday night's but tonight was horrible we called in a head of time to get quicker service the hostess said it would be a 25 min wait later we checked in 40mins later the hostess FORGOT about us! She actually said she forgot about us!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale
