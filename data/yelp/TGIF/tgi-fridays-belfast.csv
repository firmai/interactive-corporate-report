Caoimhe M.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",39,92,447,4.0,8/10/2016,"Tgi's is a worldwide chain restaurant. My first time trying their food was in New York & I was sold. When it came to Belfast I was over the moon. Belfast's version doesn't quite hit the same spot as New York but it is still dependable if you want some American comfort food. The decor is quite funky with lots of old toys and records on the wall making it really colourful. Staff are friendly and quick to give you their attention and introduce themselves. I visited with my two young nieces and they were delighted to be given some colouring in packs and crayons to keep them busy whilst their food was being cooked. The kids menu is your normal burgers, hot dogs, fish fingers etc.  The cocktail list here is pretty extensive and includes mocktails which is always nice to see when you want something other than a soda. I chose a raspberry, mint, elderflower, rose & soda concoction which I can't remember the name of but it was really refreshing and fruity.  For my main I had their Jack Daniels sesame chicken starter as a main with a side of sweet potato fries. The JD sauce is sticky sweet and tangy with a very light flavour of JD.  It's really good, although too much would be quite sickening. It can be found throughout their menu and seems to be their signature sauce. The sweet potato fries are perfect here, fresh, crisp and piled high.  We were sat around a raised round table which was quite uncomfortable due to its height and felt quite cramped. It was also very stuffy in the restaurant and some air con wouldn't go a miss on the few days the sun comes out to play. They have a lift for wheelchair access. It's pretty slow and noisy but does the trick. Overall this is a good place for families or a group of friends to catchup over cocktails and diner style food at decent prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Andy M.,"Bangor, United Kingdom",50,36,95,2.0,1/5/2016,I think TGI Fridays gets all the credit due to being such a big chain. I personally don't see the hype about it.  You can eat in local restaurants for far better quality and just the same price wise. Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad but it's just very mediocre. The staff are very good and do everything they can to help you and the service was quick despite being very busy. Which maybe isn't a great sign either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Christine S.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",58,511,849,2.0,3/7/2016,"Good points: they have a good menu choice and the interior is nice and spacious. Unfortunately the standard of the food is just average, but the price is extortionate. Definitely not worth it. Both times I visited, the service was average. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Ciara S.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",824,753,6097,2.0,9/30/2015,"I'm not a fan of TGI Fridays. Tasteless, bland, processed food which is over priced for such a low standard. There are better restaurants in Victoria Square than this uninspired American Diner...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Emma B.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",31,422,1531,4.0,5/11/2015,"TGI Fridays is a lively quirky diner that serves a range of burgers, chicken, steak, fajitas, seafood and so on.  My favourite is probably the Jack Daniels chicken.  They also serve a range of appetisers - the loaded potato skins are lovely!  The cocktails are great also.  Word of warning though, when it's your birthday they tend to make a fuss of you in front of everyone so be ready for it!!  Look out for the cinema deal too where you get meals, drinks and Odeon cinema tickets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Noel D.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",5,31,3,4.0,2/15/2016,"Start off by making sure you have room for a TGI Sundae, they're amazing and could be shared between two. A wide variety or cocktails alcoholic and virgin to hit the spot. My favourite meal from TGIs is the sizzling chicken fajitas. Fresh vegetables, delicious sour cream and guacamole with chicken perfectly cooked. Recently portion size has decreased so no longer worth five stars but still worth a try to newbies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Jamey C.,"Ashgill, United Kingdom",0,2,,1.0,7/11/2015,"This is a poor excuse of a T.G.I Friday's menu is lacking in variety of food options nothing like my local Buchanan street Glasgow, I can't fault the staff they were superb and friendly, the food also lacked in presentation and volume and colour nothing like Glasgow once again so onto the burger i ordered today the cheese on my cheese and bacon burger was a few grated bits of cheese as if out a packet with a tiny rasher of bacon to top it, I wasn't the only one disappointed as a family of five of us dined here tonight ranging from 47 to 13 all let down miserably by this experience, one of us ordered the 7oz steak well done instead he was served with a very extra rare steak with a pool of blood after a complaint management apologised for they're mistake and refunded the steak along with 2 free cocktails for our next visit, once finished I spoke to the manager telling him of TGI Fridays in Glasgow and the extensive menu he then told me that they had an extensive menu until TGIs cut it down to a very limited range, shame as this has effected both customers and atmosphere, as I've said the staff were great but I don't go to TGIs for the staff more the food and on this I would steer clear of TGIs next time I'm in Belfast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Andrew B.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",3,139,163,4.0,9/27/2010,"I have only been here a couple of times and I have loved it but have found everything to be on the pricey side. They have your typical bar/waiting area with sky sports news playing in the background.  The service is good and you do not need to have a booking, you can just walk in and you should get a table pretty quickly. This restaurant is pretty true to the chain but is just that little bit expensive to justify making it a regular stop. They do good milkshakes and have a good little movie menu cinema deal which is well worth it. Don't all rush at once!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Brian C.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",3,447,450,4.0,7/22/2010,"Yes yes yes. Finally an American style diner which is actually good. Springsteen's springs (pun) to mind when I was here and all I could think of was that TGIs is miles better. It is a pretty typical American restaurant - big food, big ideas, big restaurant! It really isn't to everyone's taste. Some people are revolted by the idea of an American restaurant with burgers, ribs, steaks etc. I think they are called vegetarians... But they do have a couple of salads and ""apparently"" 500 cocktails, which even if they didn't do food, I would still go in. It is a great place to go if you are in the middle of a long day shopping and you find your energy waining ever so slightly. It also works if you are having a pub crawl and you are starting in the city centre and working your way out home... which I definately recommend :D The rack of ribs aren't quite Tony Roma standard but are certainly almost as good. The chicken quesadila is great and very well made. I had an attempt to try make it myself but it failed pretty miserably. TGI's does it well. May not be to everyone's tastes as some meals can look a bit too 'fast-food'-esque, but overall it's very very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Paula G.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",2,389,417,2.0,9/29/2010,"OK, I'm just going to be up front from the get go.  This isn't my kind of place and I only went in because the kids have been cajoling me to try it for months.  So in we went and the kids love it.  Me, not so much.  It was loud and bright and in your face which I suppose explains the difference of opinion.  On to the food.... Maybe I'm getting old and fussy but I don't want to have to wrestle with an unwieldy big menu while trying to sort out the kids.  The list of food available was quite mind boggling but at the same time didn't seem to give much variety.  It's basically meat with chips and/or coleslaw.  The children ordered chicken strips from the kids menu and wolfed them down.  A sure indicator that they had been cooked from frozen and resembled something from McDonalds. My rack of ribs was OK.  The actual flavour was quite nice but there was very little meat on them there bones and I thought they were overcooked.  I'm no chef but the ribs I make at home using one of Nigella's recipes are much better.  Yes, OK, I am getting old. Everything came with frozen skinny chips which I don't really find Ok to serve up to an adult in a restaurant where main courses cost around £16.  Coleslaw came in a weeny little pot and what there was of it was quite nice. My advice? Take the kids who will love it and just have a drink yourself.  You'll need it to survive the noise levels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Tia C.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",9,345,280,3.0,10/2/2010,"TGI Fridays are all over Dublin too and are always very popular for work nights out. It's a big chain but it's certainly not a bad one.  They serve authentic American food like burgers and chips, steak, or chicken dishes. It's pretty basic and whilst it doesn't have the atmosphere for a special meal treat it as a quick bite joint.  As it is on the top floor of Victoria Square, it's a really popular place to pop into before going to the cinema. Popular and quality but average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
declan f.,"Ards, United Kingdom",13,385,220,3.0,9/26/2010,"TGI Fridays is a fairly good chain of restaurants, as you know what you are going to get when you go there: American style doo is an American style diner environment with overly weirdly dressed waiters. The menu is really large and varied, and it is actually difficult to narrow down what you want as the menu goes over several pages. I came here one Friday when my girlfriend were in uni all day and hadn't ate all day, and here going to the cinema and decided to try here. I got a bacon cheeseburger with Jack Daniels BBQ glaze and it was really tasty. The sauce was very moreish and my beef was a good bit nicer than my girlfriend's chicken burger which was frankly unremarkable, not bad, but not spectacular. However for desert we got this kind of Oreo ice cream creation which was really nice. Our waiter was wonderfully nice and attentive so that is a plus that this place has going for it. It can be very busy, so if you are determined to eat here be sometimes prepared for a long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
Robbie B.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",1,652,628,3.0,9/8/2010,"This place is what it is. That may seem like an obvious statememt but its true. It's an American style restaurant & bar, serving a fabulous range of authentic American food and drink, all in a fantastic party atmosphere, Try the Jack Daniels Grill range - exclusive to TGI Friday's. Not forgetting TGI Friday's huge range of exotic cocktails. This isn't really my kind of place to be honest. Its a bit of a chain with the ambience painted on the walls but its not bad to go and check out if you fancy a quick bite to eat and a drink before you to to the movies.  Pretty basic, but its alright.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast

J K.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",9,492,558,3.0,8/14/2010,"I'm torn between the kitsch American attitude of this place, the memories of my first time in New York and the friendly staff. At the same time this place has an awful lot to work on... My first TGI was just across the road from the Empire State. Back then before the chain reached our modest shores I hadn't quite established what sort of place it was. I vaguely remember Jack Daniels glazed baby back ribs which were, as you can imagine, superbly moist. I first went to the Belfast restaurant just after it opened, with my girlfriend for a half decent steak and large portions. I can't remember the scenario or the circumstances but we ended up here.  The menu is complicated, large and diverse. By diverse I mean it's a long list of dead animals (which is no bad thing in my books) The only concern I have is £13-14 for fajitas is seriously pushing it. I ended up with a sirloin (you get two sides with your main) cooked rare. It was brought to my table after a pretty long wait (there were maybe four tables in a very large restaurant. I called a waiter over and told them my side orders were wrong, to which he apologised and took the offending plate away. The antics began shortly after when, the head (I don't know if they were the head of anything but they were superior in some way) waitress came over, apologised for my food being taken away and brought the exact plate back.... things are not going well.  All was rectified in the end however, at £17 for a 10-12oz sirloin of average quality and two small meagre sides.... not impressed. The standard of food in the city has increased exponentially in recent years and this will not survive in a sea of fantastic pre-theatre menus and solid pricing by some of the top restaurants in the city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-belfast
