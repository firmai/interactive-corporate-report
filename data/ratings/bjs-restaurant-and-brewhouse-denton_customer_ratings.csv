41,Amy S.,"Carrollton, TX",288,25,,3.0,2014-10-01,"Good food mediocre service. We got more attention from other servers and the manager than we did our own. Our entrees ended up coming out 15 minutes before our appetizers which was irksome but it was delicious nonetheless. Our server brought our check about 5 minutes after the food came out but we wanted dessert. You can't go to Bjs without getting a pazookie! So we ordered it through the manager because I'm pretty sure Alexandra (our server) wasn't gonna come back until we were ready to pay. Overall it would have been an almost perfect experience if only we had had a different, perhaps more experienced, server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=80,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001

40,Jim B.,"Dallas, TX",75,79,7.0,3.0,2014-10-28,"Normally I'm a big fan but tonight the food quality of my dish was not up to par. But since all the other times I've eaten here the food is always outstanding I'm definitely going to give them more chances.  The chicken for the balsamic glazed grilled chicken was very overcooked, dried out with a burned charcoal flavor. However I will say the calamari was absolutely fantastic and that's what kept my rating from being lower than 3 stars. There were 8 of us and the server did a very good job keeping our drinks refilled and being attentive to our needs separating our checks and getting our payment done quickly.

42,Jimmy J.,"Denton, TX",3,18,1.0,3.0,2015-01-29,"Food (2 stars): I was unimpressed. I haven't been to many BJ's to know if this place is serving the standard quality. The menu is quite large with a plethora of options. On this trip I was with the whole family and was able to sample a variety of the menu. First, they have a great beer selection. Tons on tap and more in bottles. Their house beers are around $5.50 a pint and roughly a $1 cheaper than any other draft. I tried the Brewhouse Blonde and Harvest Hefeweizen. Both were very good. For an appetizer we ordered the Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. The whole table agreed the Chile Verde did not taste that great and really ruined the fries. Also the cheese seemed to be the first thing added to the bowl because it was all melted at the bottom and not on the fries. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger; it was just ok. Red Robin and Chili's make better burgers and for the $10 price tag I expected more. The bacon and cheese were cut thin; I could see through the cheese to the burger. The lettuce was completely wilted. If they put mayonnaise and their ""signature burger sauce"" I could not tell as both buns were dry. My wife ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. The meat was very tender and tasty. The breading stayed together and did not fall off but had little flavor. The country gravy had a good consistency and flavor but they didn't serve enough on the steaks to have with every bite. The mash potatoes were dry which made the fact that they were served without gravy even more obvious. The boys had the Kid's burger and chicken strips. The boys all agreed that they were good. The lettuce for their burgers was served on the side, so it was nice and crisp; wish they would have done that for mine. Facilities (5 stars): Being new, this place is very clean. Walking in the dining room is laid out well with the bar area on the right and tables on the left. The bar itself is an artistic focal point with lighted shelves illuminating the well organized bottles of liquor. There are several TV's located through out the bar and restaurant; not to many to be in your face but just enough so you can watch from any seat. Booths are comfortable albeit a little tight. The bathroom is clean, but laid out rather odd and 1 of the 3 automatic faucets did not work. The parking setup is the only issue and it's minor. There is minimal parking in the front, so we had to park in the back and walk around. Service (4 stars): We had good, but not great, service. The restaurant was probably at 60% capacity. We wanted to sit in a booth and one was available but had to be bussed. It took about 5 minutes to have the table cleaned; not a long time at all but considering I didn't see them cleaning any other tables before ours made me question why it took so long. Our server was attentive and kept the boys' sodas refilled quickly (one of my major markers on quality of service, my glass better not be empty). Orders were brought promptly and issues (missing ranch) were resolved with speed. Value (2 stars): For a mid-week dinner out with the entire family, a couple beers, and an appetizer our bill after tip was around $70. This is on the high end of what we look to expend and for the quality of food not a good value. It would have been nice to have some happy hour specials. Overall (3 stars): I like the layout and look of this BJ's. The beer was nice and cold! I'll be back to sit in the bar and have a few drinks, but the family agreed we probably will not be back for a dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=80,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002

34,Riley L.,"Denton, TX",128,176,58.0,4.0,2015-02-08,"The beer that BJ's actually brewed is really good, but it's all over $5.25 a glass, so that hurts. The food was pretty good, but it was about the same level as Chilis, TGI Fridays, and Applebees. Service was great though and we had a really good time just sitting and talking. Didn't feel rushed at all and continued to get good service the entire time we were there. The beer is worth a try but it's expensive and the food is on par with all the other chains, but there is a huge selection of everything.

We ordered drinks and some water for the table.  My water arrived with something green floating in it.   Our server wasn't anywhere to be found so had to wait until she returned to take our order.  We placed our order - Cherry Chipotle Salmon and French dip steak sandwich.  We saw our server only when food was being served.   When the food arrived it look good.  The Salmon was very good but didn't have a lot of the chipotle sauce as they advertised.  All the couscous was lemon tasting as someone added a lot of lemon to the dish.  Overall it was good.  As for the French Dip, it looked appealing but aft r a fe bites we realized the sandwich was actually cold.  We couldn't find our waitress so my date continued to eat his sandwich being hungry.   After almost completing his dish, our server appeared.  We asked if the sandwich was supposed to be hot.  She said yes and got the manager.  We told him the same thing.   He said he would notify the kitchen and offered to make another sandwich.   Considering my date ate most of his we declined.  It was nice to see they remove his entree from the bill when we checked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=80,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

The host staff never walked out to the seating area to call my name, either.  When I asked about seating I was told we would be the next table that was seated however another party was seated before us so my party left.  I feel that the host staff needs to be trained to ask for the party in a reasonable amount of time if the party does not show up after being texted.  I was very disappointed since I have not visited BJ's Brewhouse in several years and I was looking forward to dining there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton?start=60,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724

We flagged down another waiter to take the potatoes back.  Ribs were ok....that was the only decent part of the experience. This was their their second chance we tried them n about 7 months ago and it was even worse.  Husband got sick from the fish.

I had a pumpkin pizookie that was pretty good but I bought a large chocolate chunk pizookie for my daughter and took it home and the cookie portion was cooked to a crisp. this is the second time we've been there and the second time we ask for a gluten free menu which is so small and printed out on regular paper you can't even see it not even the waitress could see this or read it.

I am in Denton often for work and usually struggle to find something different for mealtime. This location being new, I thought I'd give BJ's another try. Bad idea. Waiter was a fuzzy, less than enthusiastic guy who had the tone of ""I hate being here"" in his voice. When he finally plopped our drinks on the table he said ""I'll be back in a minute"" and walked off. He returned about five minutes later to ask if we had decided.... Um... While waiting for the food to arrive I noticed ALL wait staff was moving in half speed. I had plenty of time to notice that this place had the same cold pretentious atmosphere that I hated about the first BJ's I had been to.

Another several minutes later the waiter passed by and said the food was almost done. When I initially sat down, I checked and answered an email. That was at 12:08.

My sirlion was tiny and was definitely almost well done instead of medium rare. I didn't want to wait another 20 minute for another puny piece of meat, so I ate it with disgust. It came with 5 pieces of asparagus and tasteless mashed potato all for ~$16 I believe. Glad I didn't order the $22 ribeye. The salmon dish looked nothing like the picture. It was barely half the size. The shrimp pasta dish was not good I'm guessing because only the shrimps were eaten, and we didn't take the rest of pasta home (mostly untouched).

Then came the entrees and they were just basically reheated food with the Barbacoa chicken and a personal pizza.  Both entrees were not even heated thoroughly and were just lukewarm.

8,Greg B.,"Denton, TX",18,33,54.0,4.0,2017-01-26,"This place has surprisingly become one of our new favorites in Denton. That also has a lot to do with the great location right next to the Cinemark and the times that they're open. They stay open until 12am most nights. The service is usually pretty good, although there's been a couple instances where we've waited longer than usual just to be greeted by the host and given a table. I'm talking several minutes of looking at open tables and for assistance with no acknowledgement of our existence.  I'll say though, they've definitely made up for it with the delicious food and drinks we've had here. We typically get our food pretty fast after ordering, and the waiters that have serviced us have all been outstanding and friendly. This restaurant has an enormous menu, so much so that you might be overwhelmed by the vast amount of entrees and drinks offered.  They surprisingly have really tasty boneless wings with several sauces to choose from. On this particular night I had the Spicy BBQ sauce, which I've had here before on my wings and they're very good! Super crunchy, hot, and full of juicy chicken with the perfect amount of sauce slathered on them. Their root beer glaze flavor is also delicious. Ariel went with the Mediterranean tacos, which she loved! She also loves their sandwiches. They also have delicious pizzas and desserts. Particularly the pizookies and monkey bread! Even though we've been several times, there's still so much on the menu to try, which we both look forward to very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

13,Tiffany K.,"Shady Shores, TX",85,25,8.0,1.0,2017-02-26,"I was here for lunch today with friends, it was a busy, understandably so, it's a Sunday. I orders the lemon thyme chicken. A lunch size portion of herb-roasted chicken breast seasoned with Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub. Served with brown rice, sautéed red onions, fire-roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes and roasted brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce. Sounded good & looked good too. I was brought a bowl with brown liquid with two pieces of chicken, not oven roasted, look like it was boiled. No bright colored oven roasted peppers or Brussels sprouts. It was a brownish collard sauce with mushrooms and and over cook brussels sprouts, couldn't find one pop of color in the whole plate, look disgusting. I took a bite just to see it could taste good ? No I politely called the waiter over and told him that there was no way I was going to eat... Go ahead and just bring me a turkey burger, he apologized and said yeah doesn't look right. The turkey burger shows up looks great cut it in half? Something doesn't look right it's raw. It's raw???  i'm so glad I did not take a bite of it. I was shocked that any cook whatever do that, my 14-year-old nephew knows how to cook a turkey patty and he knows that you can't lay it on the grill for one second. In my heart I honestly feel that it was done to me on purpose because I sent the first plate back. I wished I would've taken a picture of the first plate of food, it was disgusting looking. Very rarely do I send my feedback or complain but when I am paying $13 for a lunch that looks nothing like what I ordered I'm not going to just eat the cost and throw in the trash. I'm now feeling so upset that anyone would do that! The manager came over and apologized saw the raw turkey burger &  acknowledged that it was raw. She asked if I wanted anything else ?   No thank you.  she took it off my bill and we left. I love BJ's in Louisville.

He brought out the wrong food then proceeded to tell me ""well you ordered this."" Then the whole meal went on just like that. Our drinks were refilled only after they were empty, and after we made a comment it seems he stayed away from our table as much as he could. Just a bad attitude. Terrible service.

Food is pretty decent.  They seem to be making an effort to get some more healthy options on their menu.  We tried the roasted cauliflower and the beets.  Both were good, but prices are a little high.   If you are going for a nice dinner or date, than this is not the best place for you.  This is a loud and busy place that's much better suited for watching a game or going out with friends.  They have a ton of tvs all around the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-denton,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

That is DEAD WRONG!  No excuse for this as the place was only about 15% full, though not surprising when one looks at the menu prices.  Note that the sandwiches on the ""Hoagie Rolls"" are mostly bread in their pictures.   Our first time back in more than a year and all we noted were inflated prices.
