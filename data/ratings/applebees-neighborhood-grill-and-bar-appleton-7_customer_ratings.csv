21,Xianfox F.,"Appleton, WI",41,6,1.0,1.0,2012-12-02,Tried to eat here yesterday. Tried. No one ever waited on our table. We ended up leaving and going elsewhere. The whole time we were there I could see 5 staff members loitering at a table in the bar not 10 feet from me. I'd give them zero stars if I could.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
17,Jimmy C.,"Appleton, WI",2,145,22.0,2.0,2012-12-28,"Our visit was around 12 on a Thursday.  We waited for 5 minutes at the front waiting to be seated and then had to choose between a small booth or wait for the hostess to wipe down a table, we chose the small booth.   With it being earlier in the day I had thought the staff would be more polite and chipper, I was wrong.  Everyone we interacted with was off putting and seemed as if they hated they were there.  Seemed to be a lot of confusion of which food order went to what table and so on.   Our food was mediocre, fish was really greasy and the sandwich had all of the contents loaded mostly to one half.   If I eat at this restaurant, I try to eat at the other location.  I have never had a good experience here.  Whether it be the food or the staff, something has always gotten messed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
16,Scott B.,"Appleton, WI",33,18,28.0,1.0,2013-06-01,"Let me put this as succinctly as possible: DO NOT EAT HERE! Go ahead and get a $2 long island if you want to get trashed on the cheap, but do not bother eating here! Horrible food and service. I ordered a burger that was supposed to have blue cheese crumbles on it and they barely had any on. When I questioned the waitress, she took it back to the cook and came back with the following response; ""The back of blue cheese crumbles was down to the bottom and they didn't want to open another bag"". WTF?! That same night, my whole party was dog tired from moving our apartment and I had forgotten my debit card. You'd think the waitress would have tried to flag us down. Nope. Nothing. Never going there. The food at the other Applebee's across town is just as bad, so don't waste your time their either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
20,R T.,"Appleton, WI",0,10,5.0,1.0,2013-09-21,The waitress bypassed my small group of two to help a larger group that got there after we did. It was very rude. We left and never went back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
0,Beth H.,"Black Creek, WI",0,13,5.0,1.0,2013-09-29,"We ate at this location yesterday (09/28/2013) about 2pm and had terrible service.  First the hostess acted irritated that we even came to eat.  Then when she was leading us to the bar I asked to sit at a regular booth, she complied after rolling her eyes and giving me a look that said ""seriously.""   Our waitress had a much better attitude but her service was still below par.  When I asked for water a waiter came by a few minutes later and slid it on the table hastily and while continuing to walk away said, ""There's your water.""  The restaurant was terribly dirty too.  We had menus on our table that had sticky food chunks on them.  I saw food drippings all over, on the walls, the booth seats and backs and our table had been wiped down but it still felt grimy.  Our booth seat had a huge hole as well. Our food was good, but we can get good food elsewhere with nicer staff and a clean environment.  WE will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7?start=20,,,,,
1,Joe B.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,14,,1.0,2014-02-08,"Had a steak, never again. Dry, over cooked, and bland. I had ordered it medium rare. Waitress adjusted the bill, never did see the manager.

13,Amy K.,"Kaukauna, WI",0,3,,1.0,2014-11-23,"Applebee 's has really gone down hill.  They used to have really good food, now it sucks!  Last time we were there, they brought my kids' meals out 15 min before our dinner, so by the time we got ours, they were done eating and rambunctious so we could not enjoy our dinner.  Food was horrible.  Fast forward to today, thought we would give then another chance.  Once again, food was terrible.  Husband got a club sandwich and bread not even toasted and looked like something they just threw together without a care in the world.  The rest of our food was mediocre at best.  Server seemed very pushy to rush us out since we were his only table and was interrupting him watching the Packers game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
12,Nancy W.,"Combined Locks, WI",648,8,4.0,1.0,2015-02-25,"We always came to this location,  NOT anymore! !!l last five times we have been here we have waited almost an hour for food to come out. One of the times waitress forgot to put our food in after an hour apologized but did not do anything about it,food at this location is missing ingredients their entrees my oriental salad came out with just the greens and no almond noodles. ..So again we are here and our food just came table and it has been one hour to the dot! !!!my husband said I'm done! !!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
14,Dave Z.,"Appleton, WI",30,4,,1.0,2015-03-04,Horrible service. Every waiter/waitress I've had there except Melinda has been awful. I used to go there all the time but I will not be returning anytime soon because even their food has gone downhill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
19,Don D.,"Appleton, WI",0,1,,1.0,2015-03-21,The greeter at the door was filthy. The food was low quality. Worst of all my soda has lettuce in to. Terrible!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
18,Danielle W.,"Appleton, WI",0,22,,5.0,2015-03-21,I don't know what people are complaining about. This place is great. I really loved our meals and the service was fantastic. No complaints whatsoever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
15,Stacey B.,"Menasha, WI",7,5,1.0,1.0,2015-04-22,"Wow, I agree with the other reviewers.   This place has gone downhill.  Met a friend for lunch, thank goodness we weren't in a hurry.     It took 5 minutes for our waitress acknowledge us, then almost 10 more minutes before she came back to take our drink order and then at least another 7 minutes before we received our drinks.   There were 5 other tables besides ours and three servers, so not overly busy.    We ordered and it took an long time for a grilled cheese and a 1/2 salad and second salad.   My friend asked to substitute chicken instead of shrimp.   The waitress came back to tell us it would be an extra $3.49, did she still want it?    At which time she changed her order and ordered a different salad and asked for no dressing and salsa on the side.   It came fully dressed.   The chicken was cold.   Our waitress returned it and brought her a new salad.   The new salad had the tortilla strips as advertised in the menu ( the first one did not), the chicken was warm and the salsa was on the side.   Yeah!   I ordered the lunch combo.   My salad was drenched in so much dressing, I couldn't eat it.   It looked like soup on the plate.   I did say something and I will say the manager acknowledged my issue and refunded half of my combo cost.   Very disappointed in the food and the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
11,Renee K.,"Ontonagon, MI",0,3,,1.0,2015-06-22,"First of all the floor was absolutely disgusting!  Had to walk over it several times to get to the restroom. Nasty! It was unkept, wet and a true fall hazard. The food order we placed was incorrect,  twice. Ordered chicken for 4 kids and got mozeralla sticks & macaroni,  just wanted chicken and mozeralla sticks...just like the picture.  The waiter attempted to bring us macaroni mixed with chicken. Not only did we get bad service but the manager just came over and said, "" this is his first week."" Poorly managed, the manager could have asked, "" how can we fix this situation to make it better."" Instead the waiter just said he will take off the meals, which were apparently 99cents each. The manager could have made it back to the table at least a second time to check up on the coworker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
10,Catrina H.,"Long Island City, NY",26,19,16.0,1.0,2015-07-12,The staff is nice enough but the food is absolutely atrocious. The meat on the chicken wings were grey in color...most likely from a few days earlier. The burger was ridiculous. We ordered a triple bacon burger to split and it literally had half a piece of bacon in it. Wow. So sad that a chain could be this bad. Steer clear of this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
8,Bruk K.,"Douglas County, WI",0,1,,1.0,2016-12-03,I had a terrible experience here. We waited not only 15 minutes for her to greet us but another 10 just for two waters. Then the server walked away  as we tried to order beverages. The server was pushing us out of the restaurant right when they closed. They turned off all the tvs and music to get people to leave. She came and asked for the bill 3 times. The bartender was complaining about other managers so that we could hear what she was saying. This was a terrible experience. I will not be coming back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
9,Heath W.,"De Soto, MO",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-23,"The food was pretty good. However, when I asked to sit in a different place than the hostess wanted me to sit, she acted as if I just broken a law. She finally conceded when I told her I did not want to sit in the bar but in a booth. The waiter that took my order was nice but was borderline rude -- not friendly at all.  The music was too loud and aggravating. I travel to Appleton almost weekly.  I will never come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
6,Sarah W.,"Appleton, WI",1,10,,1.0,2017-02-25,"Inedible food, horrendous service. Worst Applebee's I've ever been to. We just got some drinks and appetizers after a movie, so it wasn't a big ordeal. The waitress was horrible! For example, we finished our drinks and it was 25 minutes before we received any service. My boyfriend wound up having to go to the bar (we were at a table in the bar area) for service. The food was borderline inedible: the pub pretzels were soggy, the chips with the artichoke dip were stale, and the mozzarella sticks were frozen in the middle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
7,Mary B.,"Kimberly, WI",18,6,,1.0,2017-03-11,"I'm going to tell you about our last 2 experiences, since we never said anything about the first...we thought it was a fluke. We went at the beginning of December, to the east side Applebees with a group of 4 adults and 1 small child (high chair age). We were seated fairly fast, and it was a nearly empty restaurant, although still hours before closing. We waited for 20 minutes, and no server ever came to our table. I finally flagged down the hostess and asked if we even had a server. She was surprised and said she'd get our server. Ten minutes later, Attalah showed up to take our drink order. It took another 15 to get them....it was 4 Pepsis. Nothing complicated. No alcohol.  Anyway, we ordered, and I asked for the BBQ fries (had no idea they'd be discontinued, and the server never mentioned it)...she took the order as normal. While we waited, our drinks got low...no one ever stopped, and she stayed as far away from our table as able. Our food arrived, and my fries were normal, so I said something to the person who delivered our food (a manager), and he said they were discontinued. I commented that it would have been nice to have been told that, since I'd have ordered something else. I also asked if we could get refills and explained the kind of service we'd been receiving. He seemed very meek, and got a ""deer in the headlights"" look. Never offered to change my side, or anything. Just terrible. Then, last night, we tried again. 2 adults, and the same young child. We were seated alone, amidst 5 or 6 dirty tables, and the hostess never offered us a high chair, so I sat waiting for the server with a toddler on my lap. He arrived (Zach), and also didn't offer a high chair, my husband had to ask. Then he immediately asked if we were ready to order. I explained that we hadn't even looked at the menu. Again, the restaurant was mostly empty, and we felt we'd been segregated by the dirty tables because we had a kid with us. He brought a high chair, that was dirty and sticky and had no strap. So I asked for one with a strap. He switched them, and that one had a broken buckle. My husband tied my daughter into it anyway, and we looked at the menu. And waited. And waited. There was a table with 3-4 servers eating in the bar area, the place was dirty and gross, and the server acted like he had no clue. We didn't even order. We asked for the bill for my iced tea that I didn't touch and left. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
2,Brianna H.,"Green Bay, WI",21,49,33.0,2.0,2017-11-03,"I've had great experiences and food at Applebee's but this one I was not impressed with. It started off great with our hostess seating us fast. The waiter we had got our drinks but then took awhile to come back and take our order. The food came a bit later, but it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. I got the three appetizers deal. A cheese quesadilla, which didn't come with the normal green salsa, the beer cheese pretzels and chips with salsa. First the quesadilla was warm, the cheese for the pretzels had a film on top. Granted I know cheese gets this way but it has definitely been on the line in the back for awhile for the waiter to pick up. The chips were just covered in oil and I only had a few after just tasting the oil they were fried in. Usually these appetizers are delicious, but not this time.  To top off the ok food, the waiter took 15 minutes to get the bill to us. He came over and took our plates, took other orders over the phone and walked around. He had the bill in his hand the whole time. He finally came over after we stared at him for awhile trying to get his attention across the restaurant. Usually you can pay after you eat at the kiosks on the table but the waiter never put the bill on it. I would have given this waiter the benefit of the doubt but with just two other families there it was pretty obvious we could have had better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
5,Dylan S.,"Falcon Heights, MN",13,7,3.0,1.0,2017-11-04,"This place sucks!!!!! We waited 25 minutes for a round of drinks. During that time the bartender was not behind the bar but was flirting with the waitress. Appetizers came out the same time as the entrees, and the list goes on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
3,Andy W.,"Appleton, WI",3,75,110.0,1.0,2017-11-07,"Out with my wife and some family for a lunch to a place my Mother in Law always likes to go to. Today was the 'Nashville Spicy Chicken Sandwich'.  It's a Crispy fried chicken breast, dipped in a spicy cayenne pepper sauce, topped with coleslaw and pickles served on a Brioche bun.  Overall a disappointment, the chicken didn't taste like chicken (how is that possible?).  It was way overcooked. The slaw was nothing special. The sandwich was served with some fries that were average.  The only positive I can say is, it lived up to the 'Spicy'. Our service was average, kinda slow for refills and the food took really long to arrive.  I won't be coming back, too many other choices in town for a good meal for the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
4,Ann R.,"Greenville, WI",94,6,1.0,1.0,2017-11-18,"This place is obviously understaffed and poorly trained. We've had multiple poor service experiences here, but tonight topped the cake. It took over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by waitstaff and another 10 minutes to get 2 drinks. The restaurant had one man at the bar, 2 2-person tables in the bar area and less than 10 small tables in the restaurant with customers. The bartender was very nice and should be running the place if he isn't already.  He worked his ass off.  The blue haired waitress tried hard...seemed overworked and not happy. The blonde waitress rolled her eyes at me when I asked for plates, napkins and silver wear. I didn't realize you had to ask for those things when you've ordered food. Too much competition out there to have such terrible service.  Obviously there's a bigger problem here when the review is 1.5 stars. Pull it together people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-7,,,,,
