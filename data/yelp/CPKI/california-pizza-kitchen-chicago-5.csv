Ricardo R.,"Chicago, IL",89,8,3,4.0,3/11/2009,"So it had been a while since I wanted to try this place and yesterday was the day I decided to try it. I definitely loved the place decor and feel and it had good service. It was already past the lunch hour rush and it was empty. The wait for our pizza of 14"" was quite lengthy given the fact that the place was empty. However my brother and I did not care since we had time. When the pizza came it looked delicious and in fact it was. It had a good rich taste (we have half Hawaiian and half The Works) which gave us a good contrast of flavor.  One thing I did mention to my brother was the fact that it did not have enough cheese and it needed a bit more so that it could be more like a pizza and not a bread with toppings and a hint of cheese. Other than that, I liked everything else and I will definitely come back some time soon and I hope they do not disappoint me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Jenna S.,"Chicago, IL",788,1311,69,5.0,11/9/2008,"Why have I never been here before?!   I go out to lunch pretty frequently with my mom, who works at Washington and Clark.  We usually go to the Marquette Inn which has pretty decent diner food, but for this particular lunch date we were looking for something different.  OMG this CPS ASAP is amazing!!!  It's like a cheaper, mini-CPK.  How awesome is that?! The seating is first come, first serve which I'm sure can be really annoying during the lunch rush.  However, we were able to get a table quite easily and we snagged it before anyone else could go over.  Their menu is bigger than I expected, especially for a place that essentially says it's a smaller, quicker version of a normal CPK.  I ordered my two favorite menu items: Sedona Tortilla Soup and Thai Chicken Pizza - OMG heaven!!!!  My mom ordered the Tomato Basil Soup and the Sausage Pizza.  We both loved the soups and pizzas and the service was friendly and quick.  We placed our order at the counter and about 10 minutes later someone brought our food to our table.  10 minutes is pretty quick for CPK.  The soda fountain was nice and very clean so it was easy to get refills without asking.   AND our total was $25!  For CPK, that's hella cheap.  Normally, we spend about $40 for two people at the regular restaurant, which is super expensive.  It's good, but expensive.  At this location you can get a small or large portion of pizza and, frankly, the small is good enough for one person.  At the restaurant, the pizza is just one size and usually each person orders their own.  However, this restaurant size is the ""large"" size at the ASAP and it's highly unnecessary.  The small size is a perfect four slices for one person and it's still as good as the restaurant pizza.   All in all, a great experience.  I love me some CPK and this just made my experiences even better.  I can get quick, to-go CPK at a lower price - amazing!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Tara M.,"Chicago, IL",124,243,2,3.0,7/3/2008,"Oh CPK, I have always loved your ASAP location in the Loop. I remember when it first opened, and went there almost weekly when I worked close by. But today you disappointed me, making me wonder if ASAP actually stands for As Slow As Possible. My coworker and I trekked over around 11:30 today. We anticipated that the restaurant would be empty, given the fact that hardly anyone is working today. Sure enough, there was no line and we walked right up to get our food. I ordered my usual--chicken salad sandwich, no tomatoes, with a side salad. It took about five minutes for me to get my food. My coworker ordered an individual BBQ chicken pizza. We waited, and waited, and waited...and 25 minutes later, his little buzzer thing started going off. Yes, 25 minutes. Another group who had gotten into the restaurant before us waited even longer. And we watched one guy order, receive and sit down and eat his entire lunch and leave in the time that we waited for that one, tiny little BBQ chicken pizza. Now, granted, they were working on a pretty big catering order at the time, so it is safe to assume that those pizzas were crowding the oven. But they still need to accomodate to their regular traffic. I can't imagine what it would have been like on a normal work day if it was this bad on the day before a holiday. Don't get me wrong--the food was great, but that wait will probably keep us from going back anytime soon. CPK, way to take the ""soon"" out of ASAP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
erica s.,"Northbrook, IL",28,83,,2.0,9/2/2009,"I've been to CPK ASAP a few times, and when I went downtown, I felt like having a quick pizza. Naturally, this was the place to go. I must've been there at a good time because the woman took my order quickly, and asked me if I wanted a drink to go with it. She gave me an empty cup and I went to the pop machine, got my diet coke (pepsi, ick!) and sat down in an outside seat, because it was a beautiful day... I read a FEW chapters of my book before my lunch even got there (which is totally not okay since it's supposed to be ASAP!). Upon tasting the pizza, I was not impressed, either. I'd had the same pizza at the CPK ASAP in the Oakland Airport a couple weeks ago, and was much tastier.  I should've gone to Sbarro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Debbie E.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",89,937,16,3.0,12/12/2009,"Had delivery for a lunch meeting. Typically the full size salads are huge. We had a mix of half and full size salads and all were about the same size, meaning that the full size salads were not as typical as they usually are. And at about $10.99 a salad, that adds up, even for the expense account. They were as tasty as usually, though.  It was 10 bucks for delivery, well, OK, we did order about $100 worth of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
meg g.,"Chicago, IL",69,99,3,2.0,12/4/2008,"I wasn't going to complain about the ""6 minutes"" (10) I had to wait for my tomato basil pizza (the sauce tasted like tomato paste with seeds and came with a pile of fake Parmesan cheese as if the shaker broke mid-shake), but it was the LONGEST ten minutes in recent memory. I was held captive waiting for a shitty pizza while Jamiroquai, John Mayer, and what was probably some American Idol contestant's big hit, played over the sound system.  California Pizza Kitchen ASAP: not that fast and not worth the aural torture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Frankie W.,"Eugene, OR",225,279,47,4.0,2/4/2008,"mmm yummy pizza.. I really like their garlic selection mainly because..well.. I'm a garlic fiend ... The amount of pizza they give you is moderate, well..actually I was still pretty hungry after the first pizza  but I didn't want to eat more than my friend hahaha.  The fact that my friend only ate half a pizza while I ate more than 3/4 of mine made me feel like I have a very big stomach and that I am a fat person.. except.. I am smaller than my friend.. Oh yes, and I could care less about my weight when I am around people too. Very roomy place, you won't have to wait very long for a seat.. But then, I've been here twice and pff.. like I would know anything, right?  Wait, yes I would.. that's why I'm writing this review. Anyway.. pizza seems a little expensive.. they're about $8-$15 dollars, I believe.  Okay, I'm a frugal person, what can you do about it? They have other selections but people obviously come for the pizza.  Duh, what is the name of the restaurant again?  Ah, yes, California PIZZA Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Megan H.,"Chicago, IL",8,29,,2.0,7/28/2009,"Being an ASAP location, it does not offer the entire menu.  I went to pick up 2 salads for lunch and the total came out to $20 and change- totally not worth it.  The salad itself was good, but again not especially worth the money, and wasn't even pre-mixed.  I had to add my wan-ton strips, crispy thingys and avocado in there myself (the avocado an extra $2 btw!).  On a lighter note, the people in there seemed especially nice.  I feel like i made new friends just ordering lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Nicole G.,"San Diego, CA",228,332,92,1.0,6/27/2007,I stopped here thinking everything on the ASAP menu would be ready to go.  I was SO wrong.  I had to wait over 20 minutes!  The pizza wasn't even as good as it is in the sit down restaurants.  My chopped salad was just strips of iceberg lettuce with shredded white cheese and shredded salami and chicken....not especially pleasing.  I will not go back here unless I have no choice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Ellie B.,"Chicago, IL",256,292,2,4.0,4/24/2007,"I am constantly jonesing for a BBQ chicken salad, extra avocado.  It's the greatest love of my life.  Next to vodka.   The first time I went in there, it was during lunch, and I can attest to the fact that it was an absolute ZOO.  The woman running the food was fairly incompetent.  But it doesn't negate how tasty the food was! This morning I went in there for breakfast and I'm not certain I'm going to go back.  I ordered a spinach omelet with egg whites, and I'm fairly certain that any cholesterol I attempted to avoid was multiplied ten fold due to the grease that saturated the entire take out box.  My eggs were wading in a four-inch-deep pool of grease.  Yum.  Yum. The toaster was broken, so they offered me a free fruit cup.  SCORE!  I didn't even want the toast, so guess who's the big winner??? Four stars though for dishing out those delicious salads within walking distance of my office!  (Yes, that really is worth 4 stars.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
becki s.,"Chicago, IL",83,146,,4.0,10/23/2007,"Another great loop lunch spot. This place respects the fact most people have only ONE hour to eat, and get you a hot pizza, sandwich or very yummy salad QUICK!  And for those in a real rush, they have some of their most popular salads ready made to buy and run! I can usually find seating as people move in and out quickly. In warmer weather, they have a good amount of tables outside If you havent been to a CPK before, they have artistic kinda pizzas...i guess i can call them that. They arent known for 'just cheese and pepperoni"" although, if you want it, you can order just that.   --- I recommend trying the Thai Chicken Pizza and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I believe that those are their signature dishes and def my faves!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Rachelle G.,"Chicago, IL",91,420,,4.0,2/26/2007,"Went after work one night for a quick dinner so I can't comment on the service during lunch. Friendly staff, I wouldn't necess. consider it asap but considering that it's not fried/grilled food, they were fairly quick. Everyone should try the bbq chicken salad, prob. one of my faves!  Absolutely delish.  I actually crave for it every now and then. Very spacious dining area, although I could see it being packed during the typical lunch rush, but what place isn't? This will def. be a regular lunch spot for me once the weather gets warmer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Colleen S.,"Noblesville, IN",64,198,11,5.0,8/23/2007,"I picked up a couple of pizzas after work at 5:15 that I'd pre-ordered. They were ready, hot and they rang me up quickly. In and out...hence the ASAP name. I think they deserve those 4 letters.  I also ordered a delivery for catering this week and it went flawlessly! The lady who takes the catering orders is VERY knowledgeable and helpful - not to mention friendly as heck! My delivery was on time and came with plenty of plates, utensils, dressing...etc. neat and orderly in the bags and LARGE portions. Everyone here loved the food and the delivery guy was polite!  I have nothing bad to say about them! So I'll be calling to spend a couple hundred bucks for another department again very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Missy M.,"Chicago, IL",19,123,,2.0,3/28/2007,"Why can't this place just get it right?  There are always issues when I make the simplest of orders.  I don't even want to talk about the price.  Unbelievable.

Bruno A.,"Chicago, IL",7,79,,4.0,9/11/2007,"On a Friday night I expected this place would be packed. Walking in there was no wait, though there was a good number of people eating. The server was friendly and prompt and the food came quickly. It is a comfortable restaurant and no overly crowded as were all the other places nearby at the time. A good selection of pizza and some standbys for those less daring like myself. It was a very pleasant experience, I would come and visit again if I am nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Katty D.,"Chicago, IL",133,80,4,4.0,11/9/2007,"the service here is great.  its not always the quickest, but every time the manager has seen me and my party squirm out of hunger, he magically shows up with complimentary brownies.   i am always, ALWAYS craving the BBQ chicken salad.  try it at your own risk - you'll get addicted.   if you're going to order pizza, you might want to call in your order, those do seem to take a little bit longer.   otherwise, this is a definite weekly stop for me and my coworkers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Allie B.,"Chicago, IL",22,82,,2.0,7/27/2006,"It was CPK for sure, but defintately not ASAP.  Twenty minutes for lunch in the loop is too long to wait, IMO.  Let's put it this way, I was not LOLing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Yvonne O.,"Chicago, IL",168,810,12,2.0,12/10/2008,"CPK used to be pretty good.  Either ASAP means they are taking shortcuts on the food ingredients, or the chain has just gone bad.  I love a good Hawaiian pizza, but this one takes them FOREVER to make (never less than 15 minutes from the time I order to the time I leave) and has HAM on it - like lunchmeat ham that they cut into spirals and threw on.  The pineapple is fine, but where is my Canadian Bacon - and where are the crispy edges on it?  Where is the sauce too?  And why was there a big pile of celery in my box the last time I went?  Last time I checked, celery is not an ingredient!  They also sell red velvet cake which is just weird - that has nothing to do with California or Pizza - Red Velvet is a southern thing, leave it to the bakeries and experts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
Jared L.,"Chicago, IL",9,91,1,4.0,1/5/2007,"Standard California Pizza Kitchen fare, in a timely manner.  Solid choice all around.  One problem is lack of seating.  Every time I've been here it's packed.  Usually you're forced to wait like a hawk for a table while you wait for your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chicago-5
