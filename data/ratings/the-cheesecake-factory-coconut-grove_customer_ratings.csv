I really didn't have any expectations I just went hoping for good food and a good time. First the place is set up really nice the tables were already set for you my only problem with that is they had the forks, spoons sitting on the table without any napkins under it and I'm like damn that's kinda dirty looking. So I look past that order my food fish and chips and it was damn good. You ever closed your eyes when you eating? That's how good that fish was.

100,Monica B.,"Saint Johns, FL",94,195,82.0,1.0,2012-01-18,"Unfortunately dinner a couple weeks ago was a big crap-ola with the food. The appetizers (corn tamales & the avocado rolls) were decent but my hubby's $15 kobe burger was barely ok in taste  & the sweet potato fries were cold, not warm... Like I just left them in the fridge for 10 min cold. Not kidding!  Alas he decided not to complain so I kept my boca shut. My bro in law's burger also ok, but the fries were also borderline cold. Yuk.  My lettuce mushroom wraps were oilier (dunno if that's a word!) than a Texas drill hole & for reference a romaine skinny ass piece of lettuce doesn't help when u try to wrap stuff to it.  I had to roll that skinny thing like a joint and i didn't know if i should smoke it or eat it!!!  Please use standard iceberg or bib for Pete's sake!

98,Natalie P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",290,206,28.0,2.0,2012-02-26,"Blah blah blah. It's the Cheesecake Factory. Here's what you need to know: Food: exactly like every other Cheesecake Factory. Décor: pretty much the same as every other Cheesecake Factory. Ambiance: family central, noisy. Service: annoying, slow. I could have sworn that at 8 pm on a Saturday we were seated in ""kiddie central."" There were screaming children and their lazy parents everywhere - our table of four twenty-somethings would have really appreciated NOT being seated beside Princess Screams-a-lot. Annoying children aside, our server was a real PITA. His name was Daniel and he drove me crazy. After my drink still hadn't come out 15 minutes later, I flagged him down to let him know. His response? With sass: ""Yeah, I know, my bartender is really backed up right now."" How is that my problem? I think you mean, ""Oh no, I'm so sorry! Let me see how that's coming!"" Magically he ran right over to the computer and my drink was out in 2 minutes - he just clearly forgot to punch it in. Weirdly, after every time someone at our table said ""Thank You"" to him, he would respond with ""Thank You for Coming."" It was EXTREMELY obnoxious, but we made a game of it, and tried to say ""Thank You"" to him as many times as humanly possible. It was pretty nice payback for his incredibly negative attitude. If it weren't for the friends we were with, the manager probably would have gotten a piece of my mind. Anyway, if you hadn't guessed by the two stars and the review to this point, the Cheesecake Factory is not exactly my favorite restaurants and this is DEFINITELY not my favorite Cheesecake location. Per usual, I'll be avoiding it whenever possible. Especially because of overflow of children and their useless parents.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=80,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.9200000000000004,3.0400000000000005
101,Elizabeth M.,"Miami, FL",132,81,114.0,5.0,2012-03-05,You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.  Let me start off my saying that I am not a cheesecake fan... definitely not my dessert of choice.  However the food and service are always consistent and that would explain the line at the hostess station. The menu is huge!  So grab one and narrow down your choices while you wait for a table.   My favorites: Drinks - PASSIONFRUIT ICE TEA is delish!  Long Island Ice Teas are fantastic! Bread - Only time wheat is better than white is at Cheesecake. Appetizers - Tuna Carpaccio (AMAZING!) and avacado spring rolls Entree - Pasta Davinci Dessert - Tuxedo Cheesecake (Not your ordinary cheesecake!),https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=100,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.2520000000000002,3.1200000000000006
110,Adalberto M.,"Miami, FL",585,330,158.0,4.0,2012-03-08,"Brace yourself for some large plates! It's Cheesecake Factory. An Italian chain that is somewhat upscale in comparison to the rest, but casual enough to feel comfortable.  If you're headed this way on a weekend, make reservations or get comfortable at the bar because you're going to wait. On that note, they make really good long island ice teas, and their ""well-mannered dirty martini"" is great. Ask for blue cheese olives.  Any of their pasta dishes are decent. My favorite is the Louisiana Pasta with breaded shrimp or the Cajun Chicken pasta. Both have a little bit of a kick. The portion is huge, so you can definitely share. Not too hungry? Get their small plates, cheap and pretty good! Dessert? Helloooooo Cheesecake! During the holidays they have a pumpkin pecan one, which is my favorite.

128,Dee P.,"Hialeah, FL",0,2,,1.0,2012-05-12,Rude service - Joe Canton in particular insulting. 25 minutes waiting for the waiter to take the order. 50 minutes for the overly well done hamburger and the chicken less Navajo to arrive. - top it off with a mgr Joe Canton who insults you even though you are not being disrespectful.

Our service was great, nothing negative to say about it.   The thing is, the Cheesecake Factory's menu is the same in San Diego or Portland or Miami. . .basically fancied up versions of menu staples, but pretty good nevertheless. Bonus -- when I was eating, Pitbull came in.

Every time asked him about a certain plate his answer would be like ""I don't know because I dont eat Tuna"" or ""I don't eat that either"". Those were his answers. Wow. I wish he would have lied to me. I am very far from being a difficult customer, really... I dont expect the waiters to like everything on the menu or to give me their personal opinion on plates, that's always nice indeed, but at least be ready to give me a little description on what i'm inquiring about. He ended up just bringing the manager to my table who pretty much ended up being our waiter. He was very nice and suggested me something after describing it in detail. Once my food arrived, it was completely different from what me and him had discussed. I was starving, so I just sucked it up and ate it. The manager did come to check on  me, I explained to him my disappointment, he offered and insisted that I get a new plate, the one he had described, but I declined his offer because I was almost done with my food and had a movie to catch. So he said he would take it off my check, although I thanked him and insisted for him to not do that because I ate my food after all, he still did it. So I did appreciate that... but their waiters need to step their game up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=140,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8240000000000003,3.1600000000000006

The bread was warm and delicious. My friend ordered the Chicken Piccata and I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos.. and this is where it went downhill. They boy needed salt, badly. They were seasoned but there was no flavor which is a shame. The rice and beans that came with my dish were great though so it wasn't TOO bad but the fact I had to put salt on my food really diminished my happiness.  As always, I always come with the intention of eating cheesecake but because of the portions I could not even fathom the idea of ordering any. Ugh. The service was great.

As usual, the menu was overwhelmingly massive, and the food was good and generously portioned. I failed, yet again, to finish my whole meal.

79,Carrie R.,"Melbourne, FL",127,84,20.0,3.0,2013-07-23,"You may have been taken here on a date when you were in high school thinking you had made it into official adulthood and overlooked the gaudy decor because, hey,  you were big time now. But come here as an adult and your kind of wondering why a place called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" is fashioned as though it was erected from ancient ruins.  Any how, the food is a typical hodgepodge of everything and the kitchen sink and the portions are almost certainly not meant for normal consumption during one sitting. So fortunately if you care about your calorie intake there is a ""Skinnylicious"" menu that helps navigate you through what should be a normal serving size (though it will look minuscule if you glance at the indulgent family that is surely stuffing their faces in a booth near by). In a nutshell, service is efficient and the food is predictable- the ""skinnylicious"" menu is not bad- the fiance and I shared a pear and blue cheese flatbread which was pretty delicious, the sweet pear was balanced by the sharp and salty blue cheese. I ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich with a side salad and it was ok, not out of this world but not guilt inducing. My fiance ordered the turkey burger with the same side salad and no complaints were made.

The waitress was very friendly and her smile was very well received after getting the side eye from the hostess when I asked to not be seated in the hot terrace-like area with the big windows.  I ordered a veggie burger with no mayo and received a veggie burger with a side of mayo and traces of mayo in the lettuce and bread.  Looked like they prepared my burger with mayo, remembered that it wasn't supposed to have mayo, wiped some of it off, and them brought it out to me.  No thanks.  The burger was taken back and the manager stopped by to apologize, which was nice. After having been waiting for food for an hour I finally received my second burger. It was room temperature on the outside and cold on the inside. Cold.  Like straight from the fridge cold. I had three bites because it was 2pm at this point and I was insanely hungry, but it was a gross, cold, soggy/uncooked disaster. The goat cheese and beet salad my husband ordered was ok, but I've had the same salad at another cheesecake factory and it was a lot better. My kids grilled cheese had the most amount of butter I've ever seen in a piece of bread and the ""fresh"" fruit salad that came with it was a soggy mess.

I also want to mention that I have serving and hosting experience. During each grievance my party was more than polite.  First off, the hostess seated us in back room by the windows, which was disgustingly hot and packed! Everyone looked like packed sardines! She squeezed us at a table where in order to pull my chair out to sit, I had to hit the customers seat behind me. It was so loud I had to yell at my partner sitting across from me! We asked to be seated in the front part of the restaurant where there was plenty of room!! I cannot fathom the rational of trying to seat customers in a noisy, sticky back room when there is ample space in the front of house. There are too many tables in that back room, none of the customers were seated comfortably.  Service was mediocre at best. I ordered a Cobb salad and asked them to replace the bleu cheese with mozzarella. When my salad came out, the lettuce was tired looking and wet. It also had bleu cheese, no mozzarella. The waitress apologized and took it back to the kitchen. When it came back out it had no cheese at all, and no chicken anymore! They clearly just scraped the top portion of the salad off and didn't bother replacing the correct toppings. The kitchen should not be so lazy but our waitress did not even bother checking to make sure the order was correct. I didn't bother sending it back because clearly this staff was incompetent. Once is acceptable but if a customer has to ask you to DO YOUR JOB twice, that's excessive. To date, this was the worst cheesecake experience I have ever had.

I came prepared, having studied their online nutrition guide. It would be fun to play a guess-how-many-calories trivia game here, as one of their salads clocks in at over 1,500 calories, and some of the fruity cheesecakes (wild blueberry for one) actually score higher on the calorie scale than the chocolatey ones.  They were busy on Saturday at 1:00 pm prime time, so I planted myself at the bar. The food came out incredibly fast and all the staff was very pleasant and friendly.  Since I already knew I was going to order a slice of cheesecake, I got the healthiest salad on the menu: Seared tuna with greens, avocado and tomato. I asked for lightly dressed greens, and they still came out more saturated than I like. The salad was good but nowhere near worth $18.  Oreo Dream Cheesecake... Layers of crushed Oreos, dark chocolate cheesecake, vanilla cheesecake, thick milk chocolate icing and Oreo crumbles. Incredibly rich and fatty. Not too sweet. I took my time eating it, even though the guys next to me seemed to get some weird satisfaction out of watching me.  The cake was even better once it came to room temperature.

I do want to warn you though, that being on Cocowalk, this location can get quite full.  We had a 30 minute wait, and though that normally would have made me give this location 2 or 3 stars, our waiter Kathleen was so great and so patient (we had 3 kids in our party, on a play date, so you can imagine how indecisive and rowdy they can get), that she is the reason I decided to give them a 4.  At one point, I needed to accompany the girls to the restroom, and the waitress was perfectly fine with that.  She made sure they didn't clean our table and rushed me off to go take care of the girls.  If all the waiters are this great, then I definitely stand behind my 4 star rating.

I ordered the delicious Tamale that is $5.50 during the Happy Hour which is HUGE and perfect for sharing. In addition, we also shared the herb crusted salmon that also brings shrimp. Both of the entrees are perfect for sharing. I enjoy coming here because service is relatively quick, food is fresh, and clean. Although, service today at the bar sucked! I constantly had to call the server over for water or anything we needed. The server was very connected to his phone, talking with other co workers, and watching the TV.

First off, it's relatively small. I don't know if it's old, but it feels that way. And due to its proximity to a cinema, it's packed with large, loud families. Let me reiterate: LARGE, LOUD FAMILIES.  Actually, its likely because of this factor alone that service is exceptionally slow, the ambiance isn't as ""date-night-esque"" and the interior feels cramped.  That being said, there's nothing wrong with the food coming out of the kitchen. Same old classics, done consistently with every other Cheesecake Factory we've all likely been to.  My favourite is the Chicken Littles, a mountain of crispy tenders with mashed potato and corn. However, this time, I had El Hub get it while I ventured out into territory I had not yet explored in Cheesecake Factory before: Thai Chicken Lettuce Cups, which were actually delightfully fresh and filling.

Nonetheless, here we go:  The location in Coconut Grove is a perfectly average spot. You get exactly what you expect out of the Cheesecake Factory. Big menu with diverse selections, big portions.  I got the the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and, from my read of the menu, thought it would be like a buffalo chicken sandwich. Not so. The coating on the chicken sort of has the spicy sauce cooked in, as opposed to poured on or being tossed in. So as served this was dry, not spicy enough, and a bit underwhelming.  I asked for extra hot sauce and blue cheese dressing which I added myself. And it turned out that the sandwich was pretty good with the additions.  My sweet potato fries were average.

However, I think since employees at one location can really make a difference I am reviewing the Coconut Grove Cheesecake Factory. We were cheerfully greeted and seated immediately. The house manager, Siobhan, was delightful. She checked on us several times to make sure everything was alright. Our server was Marvin. Some adjectives to describe him are attentive, conversant, witty, and professional. These 2 individuals rate 5+ stars. The food this day, however, was somewhat hit and miss, not of the calibre of previous Cheesecake experiences. The Mac'n Cheese balls were great. The artichoke n'crab dip was fantastic. However, they provided an insufficient amount of crackers to dip with. Quick-thinking Marvin brought some fresh warm tortilla chips, but it wasn't quite the same. The DaVinci pasta was good but had a meager amount of chicken. The eggplant parm/pasta, and the garlic smashed potatoes were standard fare good. The Shrimp Scampi was on point awesome, however the accompanying steak Diane was somewhat over cooked, dry and a little tough. I conveyed my thoughts about the food to Siobhan, and she graciously accepted the ""constructive criticism"". Of course the cheesecake, in this case the ""Tuxedo"" was decadently delicious.

We have always had good experiences with the food and staff right from the start. Except yesterday. Mrs. Viviana, the lady that served our table, was apparently in the last half an hour of her shift and took short shrift of our custoner needs. First of all she did not greet us properly to make us feel welcomed. Second she pushed us to order when we were still reviewing a menu we were no longer familar with. Maybe she doesn' t know that the modern concept of a restaurant was born after the French Revolution guillotened thousands of noblemen and left their domestic help unemployed. They went to the Paris city centre to open businesses  with separate tables and a written menu. No more long shared tables and voiced menus for clients like you can see in ""The Prancing Pony"" of ""Lord of the Rings Part I"". Is she still living under the 'Ancien Regime'? Her abuse did not stop there. She did not bring us water or bread right away; she dropped my bottle of beer without pouring some of it as a courtesy. The worst came when we ordered. We have always enjoyed their pasta and seafood dishes with real Parmesan cheese grated over them. We asked for the ""Shrimp and Angel Hair pasta"" with a caveat. Extra shrimp for my son and extra squid for moi.. We were very hungry. ""We don't have that. Shrimp is the only seafood here."" she said grumpily. ""Excuse me,"" I said, ""you do have squid because I saw a dish of 'calamari' in the menu.""  ""Oh, sorry, I don't speak Italian,"" she said, sniggering."" I took a long hard look at her. ""But we do so don't try to BS us!""    After an uncomfortable impassse, Mrs. Siobhan McMahan, the manager, came to our table to sort things out. She explained that they could not sautee the squid so I settled for double Shrimp. We did some small talk and all was well.

Arrived close to 7 o'clock and our party of 5 was seated pretty quickly. Surprisingly, they weren't too busy at this time on a Friday, which was great for us since we didn't have to wait long to get a table. :)  Now, for those of you who have never been here before, their portions are pretty big. Don't fill up on the complimentary beard if you want to finish your meal. They certainly don't want you to go home hungry so definitely come on an empty stomach!  Luckily for me, I was practically starving by the time we made it to the restaurant and though I was slowly being seduced by the bread that was wickedly trying to get me to eat it, I held on strong! That was until the appetizers came and, needless to say, there went that notion. My sister was really craving the nachos so we started with that and got some pot stickers to start off the night. Our waiter was more than friendly, he certainly had some quick wit going on with some of our outrageous questions that seemed to have gotten asked. He didn't miss a beat. I am now convinced he is definitely a Jedi and really does meet up with Yoda out in the Everglades. =D Totally cool by my standards!  Also, one must have cheesecake when they go to the Cheesecake Factory! I mean, it's in their freakin' name for crying out loud!! :) The dessert menu is full with all sorts of tasty goodies that I'm sure will have you wishing you could have one of each.

Our table was sticky when we got seated. The steak was far from medium and friendliness is not known in this location. I ordered a cocktail which was done incorrectly and they did not attempt to fix it. It was a pure disappointment and I urge you to choose a different location.

24,Tyonna B.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2016-07-06,"I NEVER write Yelp reviews but this was ridiculous. I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory in Miami since I've moved here but I wanted to go for my birthday dinner because it has decent prices & I like the food for the most part but the experience here ALMOST ruined my birthday. This particular location is TERRIBLE. The service was unbelievably slow. We sat down for an hour before we got any of the bread that they serve & we didn't get waters for ANYONE unless we specifically asked. That's stuff that should be given immediately, not an hour later. But whatever. The food was subpar for me (I got the chicken nachos & they weren't even hot by the time they came out). None of the food was served at the same time so you had half the table waiting and the other half waiting an extra 10 minutes before the plates arrived. The service continued to be slow so we asked for the check the SECOND we got our entrees.....still took 30 minutes. The worst part for me was the fact that it was a birthday celebration. They knew it was my birthday because we explicitly told them multiple times. My friend told me at the end of the night that he was pissed because he went to the back and also notified someone that it was my birthday & asked them to sing and give me ice cream....because that's what they do on birthdays & I heard them in the restaurant singing to 2 other different people already. But guess what? It never happened. We had sat there for almost 3 full hours & it was almost 11:00 PM so I decided to forget about it & just told everyone they could go home because it wasn't worth it. Terrible birthday dinner for me and if I could re-do it all over again, from what I'm told: DADELAND Cheesecake Factory is much much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=20,3.04,3.13,3.13,,3.094

I am particularly used to the location at Aventura Mall since it is closer to my home. Our waitress took our order and brought our food out, which did take some time but I wasn't too picky about that. The food quality could have been better. I don't know if it was due to the fact that they were about to close in about an hour but I order the Shrimp Sandwich along with the Macaroni Cheese Balls. My fries were cold like they were sitting there for days. The fries tasted stale and cold. The waitress was going to take the fries back and get me a fresh batch but I was already full and did see it fit for them to make some more fries if I wasn't going to eat it.

I had heard many great things about the Cheesecake Factory and wanted to try it myself. This was the biggest mistake EVER!!! Our server was excellent and took the time to go over many things on the menu that I had questions about. It took me about 20 minutes to decide what I wanted because the menu is full of so many options. We ordered the fried Mac N' Cheese balls as our appetizer. They were delicious and something I've never tried before. Then I ordered a salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes, a pretty healthy choice, right? I was hospitalized later that evening because the salmon contained bacteria. 4 days later, I was finally released from the hospital.

6,Zeina T.,"Miami, FL",35,3,,1.0,2016-11-03,"Wow! I never take the time to write a review, but this was a really bad experience. How disappointing! I usually love the food there, but the staff at this location specifically is soooooo unprofessional including management.  I walk in to dine at the bar after a long day at work thinking it's one of favorite spots to eat, and nothing can go wrong. At 1st, I stood by the bar waiting for the bartender Desiree to finish texting. I waited and waited and she wouldn't turn around and never even realized I was there. So I had to interrupt her texting, and finally placed my order which I already knew without needing a menu, being a regular customer. My cellphone had run out of battery, and I needed to turn it on and use it to request Uber once I'm done. So I asked her if she could get it charged. She said that the charger is available but not for guests needs. I asked for the manager on duty and asked what this meant. The manager Nina who took long to see me said that the bartender had her personal phone charger and is free to choose whether to let me use it or not. 1st, the bartender shouldn't be on her personal phone to begin with ignoring me while I'm waiting for service. And 2nd , no one is supposed to be more important than the customer.  I ended up just walking out immediately and going to another restaurant. I will only go to Dadeland location from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove,2.96,3.17,3.17,,3.086

I changed my mindset to specifically order non-healthy meals, since I find that they do not have good options for healthy meals. As an appetizer, I ordered the Korean Fried Cauliflower. Though it may seem healthy, it probably wasn't because it was delicious. I think the menu said 1,000 calories - wow... It wasn't filling at all as an appetizer, but I would definitely order it again. My main entree was the fettuccine alfredo. I remember it tasting differently from my pre-yelp younger years. Of course when the waiter comes, I make him put an entire mountain of cheese on the serving for me. But by the time the cheese is gone, I noticed there wasn't any real flavor to the alfredo sauce. While pasta most likely always tastes delicious, this one started tasting a little bland towards the end. In my very many trips here, this is a reoccuring issue.

I've been going to cheesecake factory for years and it never disappoints me  but this location was by far one if my worst experiences ever! I'm from Orlando Fl and was on vacation in miami area with friends from California! I decided to take them to cheesecake factory since we all love it! We saw that this location is permanently closing in a couple of days and that should've been a hint to us or at least if should've rang our bell but we didn't pay attention to that! It seems like they just dont care anymore since they are closing! We started with factory nachos when we got our nachos we had a fly on the top enjoying the pico de gallo and sour cream, we noticed as the waitress was putting the plate on the table we told the waitress and we removed the fly ourselves i asked my friends if they wanted to send the plate back (as a matter of facts the waitress didn't offer us to send the plate back nor apologized or even said sorry) we decided to keep it and just removed from the plate all the chips from that area. 2 of us chose the Renee's special=worst decision ever, salad was soggy and even croutons were nasty, when Im about to try my soup my soup spoon was dirty with what looked like dry chocolate, my partner's soup salad was also dirty with what looked like dry cheese by this point we were giving up. By the way when we told the waitress to get clean silverware and showed her how dirty they were she just said ""oh ok i bring you new ones"" not even an ""im sorry"". My friends pasta was horrible, oily and flavorless by this time we just asked for our check and decided to leave!! It has been by far the worst dining experience with careless/inattentive waitress and wasted money! We decided to take our business to a local cuban restaurant instead to have a well deserved dinner and at least we had an awesome experience!
