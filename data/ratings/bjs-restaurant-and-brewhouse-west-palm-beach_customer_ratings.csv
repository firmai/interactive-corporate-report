144,ElizaBeth W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",56,132,29.0,4.0,2014-05-20,"We had the opportunity to eat at BJ's before they actually opened to the public. The location is very convenient - right off 95 and next to the new Palm Beach Outlets.  We had a reservation, so we were seated right away, but they do have a pretty large waiting area if you were to come when it was busy and without a reservation.  All of the staff was very friendly and accommodating - many members of the waitstaff stopped by our table to see how we were enjoying our experience and our meal. Our 9 month old twins were with us, which was another reason so many staff members stopped by. People can't help themselves when they see cute babies! Our meals were good! I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and I would definitely order it again! My husband had a bbq chicken pizza and he said it was good. We sampled a couple of BJ's beers. I had the Oasis Amber and my husband had the Goliath - both tasty beers! We didn't have time to try their famous Pizookie for dessert, but I definitely look forward to trying it when we return.  It's definitely worth mentioning that they have a free rewards program that you can sign up for before eating there at  . After signing up, I immediately got an email for a free Pizookie! Basically, with their rewards program, you earn 1 point for every dollar spent and you start earning rewards after you've spent $75. They also have convenient online ordering with options for dine in, take out, or curbside takeaway. The take out and curbside are pretty self-explanatory, but with their dine-in ordering you can place your order before you even arrive. They will go ahead and hold your spot on their wait list and then when you are seated the kitchen will immediately being preparing your meal. After the meal, you can even pay with your smartphone if you want. Pretty cool! Overall, this is a good family-friendly restaurant worth checking out before or after a day of shopping at the outlets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=140,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

138,James I.,"West Palm Beach, FL",46,67,3.0,1.0,2014-05-29,"We had a pretty bad experience at this location last week, which was unfortunate since we enjoy BJ's and were excited to have them opening in West Palm Beach.  I don't know if it was because it was their first/second week or whatever, but the service was an absolute mess. We were there for over two hours for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. We never dealt with our initial waitress. Many different people brought us food, got our refills, asked us if we needed anything, etc. The same meal we'd already received was brought to the table two or three times. Also, I ordered a buffalo burger - it was cooked well when I initially bit into it, but it was pretty much rare after that. It took forever to get a new one made, so I got to eat my food alone after everyone had been finished for a while. The manager came over to talk to us after all this and offered our party free desserts, but those took 20 minutes just to get to the table.  It definitely wasn't the experience I was hoping for. We'll give them another a shot, but it likely won't be for a while. I sure hope they improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=120,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
101,Alex G.,"Lake Worth, FL",116,117,363.0,4.0,2014-05-31,"Considering they have only been open 2 weeks and I have been in twice I'd say it's a solid 4 stars. Service was great each time and although they forgot my order on the second visit they made up for it and that's all most customers are looking for. Mistakes happen but if management takes the time to address the issue and make sure you are satisfied then what's to complain about. I've been to other BJ's so the menu was not new to me. I'd say you can't go wrong with the burgers and the pizza is awesome! Even the small can feed a crowd! The spinach dip is so so... it's more cheesy then creamy and needs a tad more spinach in my opinion. The avocado egg rolls are really tasty and I love that they cut them small so it's perfect to share with a group.  Pizookie!!!! Get the trio, you can thank me later :) Fresh baked warm cookie with vanilla ice cream. You will not want to share. The salted caramel is divine and the double chocolate is so sinfully delicious! I want one now. Not only do they have a great selection of their own beers and many more but their cocktail menu is very impressive. I've tried a bunch of their own beers but the Tatonka Stout is by far my favorite. Dark, rich and thick. Pure heaven! I highly suggest calling a head and putting your name on the wait list before you arrive. Since it's located by the new Outlets it tends to be really busy and the bar seems to be a very popular hangout.  I'm sure I'll be back again since they offer a great rewards program and I'm already racking up the points!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=100,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

Let me explain, my visit was at 4pm on a Tuesday and they had wait staff standing around not cleaning off tables and chit chatting about their personal lives the wait staff was also unsure of what was available, you also have the bus boys talking trash about their fellow teammates in front of customers, and as we get right down to it the food... My boyfriend had a burger and said he could've gotten a better one down the street at McDonald's I however got the steak it was over cooked, dry, and seemed like it was rolled in pepper and salt. My father got a simple sandwhich and the lettuce was wilted along with the tomatoes. I suggest this place gets their shit straight before they get more bad remarks like mine.

93,Allison N.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",252,695,596.0,4.0,2014-09-28,"I actually quite enjoyed the food I had at BJ's which was sort of surprising because I wasn't expecting a lot. My family and I decided to come here for lunch before I left town and the place was PACKED. I mean, I have quite honestly never seen this many people in one restaurant in West Palm Beach at the same time, except maybe the Cheesecake Factory. But even with a full house, we were still able to get a table speedily, which was great. We started with the potstickers and the stuffed mushrooms. The stuffed mushrooms were much better than the potstickers. Now, I'm not totally sure what was in those mushrooms except it was some sort of cheesy deliciousness that was slightly breaded. They were topped with this creamy green sauce which was pretty tasty as well.  The potstickers were okay, nothing too snazzy.  My dad and I split two entrees -- the scallops and the lemon thyme chicken. I quite enjoyed the lemon thyme chicken since it had a GREAT flavor and the brussel sprouts that came with it were really good and not overcooked. The scallops were also pretty tasty and not too fishy. Service was decent. Our waiter brought me out another soda before I had even finished half of my drink which was sort of weird since my water remained unfilled for the entire rest of the meal. Strange, but nothing too out of control. I'd come back for that lemon thyme chicken.

95,Deb M.,"Jupiter, FL",29,21,34.0,4.0,2015-01-17,"Tried this place bc it is right by the outlet mall and I needed sustenance before beginning the shopping expedition today. I wanted to order a few diff meals on the menu but since I knew I'd be shopping I just ordered an appetizer and dessert. I can't bear the thought of throwing away half my meal (I never finish a meal bc portion sizes are ridiculous in the US of A) instead of taking it home for leftovers...and nothing would be good after sitting in my car for hours as I shopped.  So, I tried the Fritto nachos...I Love Frittos and I love nachos so this sounded like a match made in heaven. I was impressed with the presentation of both the appetizer and dessert. They came out looking EXACTLY like the pic in the menu. That really doesn't happen very often.  The nachos were delish. Still crunchy even though they were underneath a lot of wet, gooey, yummy stuff..cheese, chili, sour cream. It felt really odd eating nachos with a fork, but bc Frittos are so much smaller than regular nacho chips eating with fingers isn't an option...okay it's an option but a really, really messy one.  The baked beignet was yummy too...and picture perfect. Not like a beignet from Nola but still very good. The strawberries were fresh and the whipped cream too. I love strawberry shortcake so a pet peeve is ordering it and tasting that, these have been sitting in the juice too long, flavor that happens more often than not when eating out. Don't know why it seems to happen a lot but it does. Not here though, and the whipped cream was real, definitely not Ready Whip.  The waitress (Kristen K) was pleasant and efficient. Another pet peeve is seeing the attitude change in the server when they realize the check is gonna be a small one. So whenever I have a good server and I have a small check I always tip on what the cost of a full meal would be..usually the price of what my hubby and I would spend on lunch or dinner. I'm sweet like that :-)  The only negative I would say is that the hostess was cleaning the door when I got there and told me she'd be right with me...and finished cleaning the door as I stood at the hostess stand waiting. When a customer comes in that should be the priority, the door will be there after the customer is seated. She was not friendly and didn't smile either. That has got to be my biggest pet peeve of all in regard to dining out. Hostesses are supposed to make the customer feel welcome and smile, and say more than ""One?"" when greeting a customer.  But overall a very good experience at this restaurant...if you like good ""bad"" food, like nachos and strawberry shortcake beignets definitely give it a go.

When I saw my food come before the appetizer I cancelled the order but we still got it and paid for it. Then my check took forever to come and when it did the waitress got everyone's check wrong.

We were able to use a coupon I saw on Yelp once I checked in that gave us a free app with 9.95 meal purchase so my husband and I got the Ahi Tuna and it was phenomenal. The food itself was a 5. Our waitress was nice but first thing she said was that she was pretty new so we didn't expect top notch service. We showed her our coupon and she spoke with the manager who came over and introduced himself to us which was nice. The restaurant was definitely cold so bring a light jacket. The restaurants were fairly clean. No covers for the changing table. (I have an infant so this is something I notice even though I bring my own changing pad). Our waitress did fairly well for being so new and a bartender actually brought my husband his beer (not sure if maybe it was forgotten when he asked for another or what) and she came with one too so she left us an extra beer free of charge.  Wouldn't mind coming back like I said no complaints about the food!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=80,3.12,2.79,2.79,2.448,2.9220000000000006

It's a big, noisy place, but that's what it's supposed to be.The menu is quite large, but not all the pages are bound in the same order.  Was it going to be one of the interesting burgers or a pizza.  Well, since this place started as BJ's Pizza before it changed its name and menu, I opted for a personal pizza.  A caveat, as a New Yorker, I'm biased toward NYC style pizza. I was surprised by my BJ's Classic Combo with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. About the size of a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza, this is vastly better. The dough, unlike most Chicago-style pizza (BJ's model), was buttery and yeasty (my daughter said it still reminded her of Pizza Hut but less salty, however). There wasn't a ton of cheese and the toppings were flavorful. The craft beer selection is wide and a sampler of four 5 oz pours was just $6. The Hefeweizen was spot on with loads of banana and bubble gum eatery notes and the Jeremiah Red Ale was a nicely balanced, drinkable brew. Less-liked, but still okay, were BJ's PM Porter, which was easy to drink, but nothing too special, and Nutty Brunette, which had a husky, grainy character. Service was a tad sluggish, but overall worth a revisit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=60,3.36,2.83,2.83,2.252,3.042

My friend and I only got appetizer and desserts since I had eaten a late lunch and was not hungry.  Their guacamole and chips was mediocre but had a good kick to it.  Their dessert did not disappoint , many dessert options in their menu.  I would recommend getting the trio of the pizooki desserts. They are known for their pizooki dessert and if you have never eaten it before it is a cookie almost like a pizza cookie.  They bake it, I'm assuming in a tin baking circular plate.  They have many flavors but we got chocolate, salted Carmel, cookies and cream.  Our favorite was chocolate.  All three came with a scoop of ice cream which tasted really good.   Overall I would try them again but to eat main course and dessert.  And maybe not sit in the bar area to get good service.~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach,3.4,2.87,2.87,2.38,3.082

For our meals my daughter ordered Chicken fingers and fries (wedge/steak fries) and I ordered the Fried jalapeño burger and fries (thin fries).  It's pretty hard to screw up chicken fingers and they certainly didn't here at BJs...my daughter loved them and the fries nice sized portions of both.  My burger, which I ordered medium came out well done, but was still tasty...and juicy actually.  It's a pretty big burger, especially after a salad and appetizer, so I actually didn't finish it...well, to be honest I needed to leave room because my daughter was 100% going to order the trio Pizzookie's!   If you've never had a Pizzookie you need to give it a shot.  Cookies cooked in a small deep dish pizza tray and topped with ice cream...SO good...and I'm sure they are good FOR you as well!  We ordered the Salted Caramel, the Triple Chocolate with Ghiardelli and the Chocolate Chunk.  I may have left some of my burger on the table...but my dogs wouldn't have been able to lick this dessert tray any cleaner. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is it drives me nuts when you have a beer menu and you don't update it when you no longer have the beer...or AT LEAST let the wait staff know what isn't available on a given night.  Additionally, while our service was fairly quick, our waitress never came back to check on us or refresh our waters or ask if I wanted another beer until 10 minutes after we were done eating our entrees...and then it took another 15 minutes after we finished dessert to get the check.  So the service was a little mixed...otherwise the meal was great and I would MUCH rather go to a BJs than one of the local chain places up in Northern NJ.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=20,3.44,2.87,2.87,2.448,3.098

34,Joe H.,"Boynton Beach, FL",331,96,182.0,5.0,2017-03-28,"BJ's is my favorite Brewhouse in the West Palm Beach area. They have ample parking outside so you have no problem finding a spot when you arrive. The dining area choices are perfect as they have a good sized dining room area and they have a large bar with lots of high tops available so you can have some beer and watch the game. Speaking of the game, BJ's has a LOT of TV's for the sports enthusiast. Behind the middle of their bar (up high) they feature a block of 4 large HD TV's with different games on each TV. There are a few more tv's on that wall and tv's throughout.  Onto the beer. BJ's has their own beer selection from their brewery (the WPB location's beers are brewed in Texas) and has a great menu describing them in great detail. They also have a great craft beer selection to go along with their offerings so there is something for any beer lover. The food selection is what is really impressive at BJ's. They have a section of their menu called ""Enlightened Favorites"" and they list the calorie content of the dishes for all of these selections. This section of their menu in beyond impressive with bison burgers, turkey burgers, vegetarian tacos, barbacoa cauliflower tacos, peanut chicken with soba noodles, salmon tacos, quinoa bowls, and many salads including a seared ahi tuna salad. Having such an amazing selection of healthier fare truly sets BJ's apart from the competition.  I got the Barbeque Bison Burger which comes with lean, ground buffalo, boldly seasoned then grilled to order. Topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, seared green chilies and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce.

Bj's also has a rewards program that I signed up for while there and an accompanying app. You get a free Pizookie (baked cookie dessert) for signing up and 1 point for every dollar you spend. You get $5 off for every 75 points you accumulate.  On a scale of 1-10 for Brewhouse's I give them a solid 10. Their beer selection is awesome and their food offerings are unparalleled.

This is not an exaggeration, it took almost an hour for 2 pizookies, and that was after waiting more than 30 min to even order. We were last to leave so another server tried to saddle us with other ppl food. We were told there were 2 items (totaling $21) were not on because someone else paid for them. So in turn, they added 3 items (totaling $35) and told us it was equal. We did not pay.

But now the boneless chicken wings caught my eye. After several rounds of eenie, meenie, minee mo  I ordered the wings. So tonight finally the chicken parmesan and some nice broccoli.  My goodness it was terrible. When the expediter brought it out I couldn't wait. But even before it was in front of me the bartender had noticed the wilted olive drab broccoli and he ordered a side for me. But alas the chicken was way overdone and dry. The parmesan was DARK brown not the light golden depicted. The chicken looked like it had been pressed and it had been cooked until dry and chewy. The meal comes with two sizeable pieces. I ate little more than half of one. I had to make a  serious effort with my knife. I had expected to cut it with my fork. And I believe if cooked properly I could have. I am adding a picture. Note the original broccoli as compared to the piece from the side. The really sad part about this besides my disappointment was that this excuse for dinner should have been intercepted by the cook, can't call this guy a chef,  or by the expediter.

The menu was pretty big, so I'd love to come back and try other items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
5,Erica J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",13,99,100.0,5.0,2017-11-11,"First time I have heard of this place, was when I went to Orlando for the parks. The atmosphere is casual with a beer theme. This time around I did the soup and salad combo. I loved my bread bowl with the chicken tortilla soup and salad was mozzarella and tomato. Great service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach,2.92,2.79,2.79,,2.8419999999999996

12,Bea D.,"Wellington, FL",1,30,20.0,2.0,2017-11-26,"I've eaten at this BJ's location 5-6 times, and the food prep continues to decline. I would love to show you a picture of my quinoa bowl with blackened chicken that ordered on Wed. night, unfortunately the quinoa was missing (replaced by cold brown rice) and my chicken was grilled. Turns out my dinner companion got my blackened chicken. Looked and asked for our waitress, she came 15-20 later, asking, ""how's it going, everything good?""  I said no, told her my little tale of woe, she followed up by asking if we wanted dessert. No Thanks! She brought the bill, she's discounted my dish by $7.95. Great,but what I wanted was the quinoa bowl I had last year, that's still on the menu, but that the kitchen no longer seems able to recreate. SUGGESTIONS:  reduce menu selections, get better managers, and fire the kitchen staff and start over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach,3.08,2.84,2.84,,2.9360000000000004
8,Adam B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,14,,1.0,2017-11-29,"Decided to go back after the response to my complaint on here.  IT WAS WORSE.  The food was disgusting and a tiny amount.  Upon speaking with the manager we got into an argument due to his heavy handed style and when I asked to pay and leave he told me ""he didn't want my money and to get out before he had me escorted out""   There was even a witness at the bar to all of this. KEEP THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS DISGUSTING PLACE They have made an enemy of me....for life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach,2.96,2.83,2.83,,2.8819999999999997
14,Jesse P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,1,1.0,5.0,2017-12-02,Once again this place never ceases to amaze me. Food was quick coming out and spot on in taste. 1 pound of wings for the price is a steal when they taste is as good as the picture. Service was quick and courteous.  I chose a beer they brew an was pleasantly surprised how flavorful it was. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach,3.24,2.91,2.91,,3.0420000000000007

3,Quintella J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",144,87,204.0,4.0,2017-12-08,"BJ's restaurant was pretty darn good and they offer daily specials which we greatly appreciate.  I got a great five dollar cocktail. our waiter name was Omar he was not only handsome but he was a great waiter he was very prompt, friendly and made great recommendations we had the deep dish pepperoni pizza can I tell you all type of amazing it was so good!!! I would highly recommend the pizza and we also ordered the Sriracha queso of which was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant for any party size, age and food desire because the menu options are endless and the atmosphere is bar/dine in with a laid back but nice feel and not to mention the location couldn't be better ( its right next to the Palm Beach Outlet.

0,Kristen A.,"Boston, MA",0,47,10.0,4.0,2017-12-18,"Had a superior visit to BJ's this time! The food menu has been expanded to include some clever and tasty dishes that appeal to all diners, including vegetarian and gluten-free folks. Lucky to snag two seats at the bar, we each got a beer flight and a snack. We both loved the in-house Pale Ale, I think it was called Piranha, and the Green Flash West Coast Double IPA. Snack #1 was so good I am going to try to duplicate it at home - the Turmeric-Roasted Cauliflower, which was wonderfully spiced not just with turmeric but also cumin, paprika, and some chili powder. It came with perfectly cooked red lentils and crunchy roasted slivered almonds. Just awesome! My friend reported that Snack #2 was excellent - the Couscous Mac'n'Cheese. (It's gluten-free, but she isn't, she just thought it sounded great.) It comes with bacon, tomatoes, and lots of cheese, and it vanished as quickly as my cauliflower. The service is super-friendly and professional. I love the atmosphere. I don't know about table service, as the bar is the place to hang IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach,3.44,3.01,3.01,,3.182

2,Joe B.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-28,"Went to BJs this evening Thursday Dec 28,2017 My wife read off the menu and asked for a Bacon cheeseburger for under $10.00 was told that Item was no longer available.  We both ordered a Blond beer , was also told that they were out of blond. I ordered fish and chips and asked for cocktail sauce for the fish and was told they didn't have any. That's three items they did not have in one sitting. If the items in question weren't available why were they not removed from the menu. Or told so right off. Afraid there's many more better places  to dine without all the negatives.
