Elizabeth P.,"Kansas City, KS",7,18,,1.0,2/8/2010,"I've never been a big fan of the food at TGI Friday's, but this location in particular seems to always have issues.  It's near my house, so I've been several times with friends or family and nearly every time have had slow service, or incorrect orders.  Once, I went for dinner around 7pm with a group of friends, and waited nearly and hour and a half from the time we ordered food to the time the food arrived.  At the time, it seemed all of the staff was more interested in a basketball game on the restaurant's TVs than in serving our group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-shawnee
