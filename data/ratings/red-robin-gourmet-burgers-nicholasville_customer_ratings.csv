I know they are known for their burgers, but I can't get enough of their chicken fingers or their bottomless fries (Clucks and Fries). They also can do most things gluten free! They even have gluten free buns (surprisingly delicious ones, I'm told!)! However, the type of service you get (and whether or not your fries are actually gluten free) depends on your server.

43,Olivia B.,"Bloomington, IN",47,438,30.0,1.0,2013-07-26,"I usually don't review national food chains: making an exception (bc of *). Have eaten here 12+X (usually in bar area, if alone) when I'm trapped locally for work (2010 - ). As others noted: no alcohol (even beer / wine) on Sundays. Chain is all about burger toppings / combinations, w/ seasonal / special offerings.  None standout, though, because (at least at this location) they don't season their beef while / after it's cooked.  Yep, that's right: no salt, no pepper.  Every. Single. Burger. I've. Had.   Second, for the love of G*d, make sure to switch out the ""regular"" bun. By the time it comes out from the kitchen, the bottom is soaked thru with foul grease. They don't toast their buns, so only the more substantial buns fare well. Next: the civilized world has agreed on a system for describing how they want their red meat prepared.  There's rare & medium rare (which would be understandable for a restaurant to refuse to serve), there's medium, medium-well, & well.  THERE IS NOT ""NO PINK"" & ""PINK"".  If your customers are so effing stupid that they can't order a burger properly, why on earth would you think that this binary (still entirely unseasoned) option would result in any greater satisfaction in what was served? Prob 4: Bottomless steak fries are damn near inedible (no matter what you season them with yourself).  I've ordered them a good half dozen times & have seen what others I've eaten with have been served  They're NEVER properly fried, they're meally & soft (never crisp), unseasoned, and just, frankly a waste of my effing gym time.  I have never, ever, in the course of at least a year, asked or seen anyone ask for more fries. They're effing terrible.  Prob 5: Mac&cheese side is literally cooked (plain) spiral pasta with a sprinkle of cheese over the top.  Was stunned to discover, as I knew I was paying $1.50 upcharge for what amounted to a nickle's worth of plain pasta covered in no more than fifteen cents worth of [pre-shredded] cheddar, in a little dish.  Effing VILE. Prob 6: Each of the 10 or so times I've decided to eat at the bar, the same bartender* is working.  She's* always training some new employee like a wee little lamb (note: I've never seen any of the folks she's* trained actually working there on subsequent visits), which means I get to overhear far more than I'd prefer about Red Robin corporate, marketing, upselling, and whatnot.  Am guessing not all that is communicated is ""corporate-sanctioned."" Prob 7*: Queen bee's* service is spotty at best.  She* appears entirely solicitous...except she* disappears (and none of the other employees present in the bar area will provide service if she* isn't there, directing them explicitly to do so and supervising) for fifteen - twenty minute periods, fairly regularly.  Understand that an employee's attention may be needed elsewhere, but when other employees will literally make eye contact with a diner trying to request something, look down, then look away and continue to follow the game on tv...That's some bullshit. Prob 8*: I've worked in restaurants.  I understand both the well-intentioned & manipulative desire to return change to facilitate being adequately to well-tipped.  What I don't understand is making EFFING STUPID change for diners who have not requested such.  I swear to X, every time I dine at the bar (again, same ""Queen Bee*"" as the official ""server,"" I have never received  change including a bill greater than a $5. That includes the time I stopped in a had a beer while watching a football game and only had a $50 and the time I paid for dinner for one with a bill.  This nitwit* literally gave me 25$ in 1$ and fives in change, and 45$ in $1 and 40$ in $5.  Not once, after picking up my payment has this woman* said, ""Oh, sorry, been a slow day, only had small change...Is that ok or would you rather charge?""  Instead, I end up with an effing stripper wad, for no effing good reason, after I've tipped well over 20% (despite bs). Dear Queen Bee* (Yeah, you're probs 9 & 10): You're not actually that great a server.  You're pushy.  You're far, far more focused on pushing your weight around with the servers,  training & assessing the poor pups who are assigned to you than actually serving customers, who aren't actually interested in hearing about corporate or how to make a blah, blah, blah, or whatever.  You disappear.  If you can't tone it down, at least turn the tvs up, since we're the ones your tips come from.  I used to think that this place had an empty bar because it was in Jessamine County, so folks weren't sure of the serving policies.  At this point, I'm pretty sure it's because you'd be the assistant manager all the servers and kitchen staff hate...and frankly, as a customer, I'd rather not deal with you either.  Grow a social skill, for X-sake.  Even just the one would be a mitzvah. & STOP giving me stupid change.

I ordered the guacamole burger (bunless) and a side of black beans. My burger came out cold with cheese that was not melted, along with a huge portion of lettuce wrapped around a not very substantial size of meat, especially for the ridiculous price. I was less than impressed. The beans tasted sweet to me and were not good, they were also luke warm. My husband had a burger on a gluten-free bun that he really enjoyed, he said the bun was very tasty. I tasted his fries, and they were not seasoned at all, very plain and a bit undercooked.

38,Michael M.,"Lexington, KY",38,63,101.0,3.0,2015-07-22,"My wife had a coupon for a free birthday burger from Red Robin so we decided to make that our dinner destination. While our first visit (approximately two years ago) failed to turn us into regulars, it didn't turn us against the place either.  Maybe we had ordered the wrong dish. This time around we decided to share two gourmet burgers: the Bleu Ribbon and the Chili Chili Cheeseburger. First the positives... for one of our sides we chose onion rings and they were made from scratch and delicious! On the other hand the Garlic Parmesan steak fries were bland as Hell. The seasoning  blend must have been sprinkled on after the oil had dried because it didn't stick at all. Even though the sweet and spicy ketchup was a nice change of pace, it couldn't redeem this boring side dish. As for the burgers, the patties were thin and completely lacking seasoning. So to recap: too much bun, not enough beef, zero flavor. One last thing, the chili on the Chili Chili Cheeseburger had black beans in it. I'm sorry but if you're adding chili to a hotdog or burger it needs to be a no-bean chili, and certainly not black beans. I'd give a score of 2 & 1/2 stars if that was an option, but it's not, so I'll round it up to three. One last thing, the soft drinks were watered down.

No doubt it won't impress the foodies as 5-star food overall, but in the world of Red Robins, this is a 5-star Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
32,Elaine D.,"Lexington, KY",14,479,,2.0,2016-01-21,"I readily admit to being a food snob and never cross the threshold of your basic fast food places.  Today, I wound up at Red Robin for a to-go order.  I expected far less when walking in, but It's pretty nice inside.  The staff was very friendly.   My order came out in about  15-20 minutes, but I wasn't in a hurry, and they were very busy.  While I planned on a burger of some sort, the bruschetta chicken on ciabatta roll with a side of broccoli was suggested.  (Other sides are fries or salad.)  The sandwich was a very a large grilled chicken breast with Provolone, bruschetta salsa, balsamic cream, pesto aioli and a chiffonade of Romaine. The broccoli, a goodly portion. was simply steamed.  I refrigerated it for later use.   The sandwich was pretty decent, certainly better than I expected from a place of this caliber.  To me, it's a quasi-fast food place -- and I'm still a food snob.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

Honestly, I thought it was more of a fast food or fast casual type of place, it's not. It's a sit down restaurant that I wouldn't recommend if you're on a lunch break or in a hurry. I ordered a basic burger and one would think that a place that prides themselves or claims to have ""gourmet burgers"", that it would be something more than what it was. Actually it came out cold and the bun was soggy. It had obviously been sitting awhile before it was brought out to me. After waiting 45 minutes, I was hesitant to send it back, but if I'm going to splurge the calories for a burger, I want to enjoy it. The manager apologized but was a bit odd about it. Don't ask me ""what do you want me to do? Is half off ok?"" That's just odd, I just wanted a burger, I'm not going to tell you or ask you to take $$ off. After another 20 minutes of waiting for the replacement burger, I came close to walking out, but I roughed it out and I must say that second time around was much better, just not what I would call ""gourmet"". The steak fries are bottomless, but not very good IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Before last night, it had been a few years since I had eaten there, but decided to give it a try since my fiancé is having surgery in a few days and is forbidden from consuming any carbohydrates (she liked the option of getting lettuce instead of bread). Anyway, while she was happy, I found my burger (The Burnin Love) to be bland and not Burnin. While nothing is ever usually spicy enough for me, this burger had zero spice. The fried peppers were flavorless, the salsa was flavorless, the bun (onion roll) was messy and pointless, and the actual hamburger seemed like it was a patty straight out of the freezer and defrosted. It was gross. Kudos for having some low carb options at a burger joint, but damn your food sucks.

35,Gene T.,"Lexington, KY",0,7,,1.0,2016-08-27,"My family of 5 has been visiting Red Robin (this location and, before that, one in Cincinnati) for at least the last dozen years or so.  I think we're finally done.  Here is a copy of an email I sent to RR corporate regarding our latest, and last, visit.  The only response from corporate was a ""thanks for your feedback"" email.  No attempt to save us as a customer, nothing. ""Just had to drop a note to describe the horrible experience we had last night at this Red Robin location. We've been eating at Red Robin for over 12 years and this is only the second time I've ever been prompted to write about an experience we've had that's made my family question ever going back. To summarize our negative experience, in no particular order:  - Was seated promptly but at a table that had extreme light reflecting off cars in the parking lot. We asked if blinds could be closed but were told, ""They don't go down any farther."" So, we asked to be moved. Hostess moved us to the adjacent table...with the same issue. The amount of light reflecting towards these tables was obvious, so why would the hostess even seat anyone at those tables until the sun went down further?  - After being seated no server came by for over 10 minutes.  - We were a table of 4. Table of 7, immediately behind us, got their entire order fully 5 minutes before we did...and we were there 15 minutes before they were!  - Our kids wanted to play games on the game pads at our tables (hostess had to scoot two tables together, so each came with a game pad). We couldn't get either game pad to work. Both had error message, ""We want you to have fun (but you need to order your drinks first)."" We kept asking server about it, she said she'd ""check on it"", but never did. By the time the food came we gave up...no time left for kids to play games at that point. So, we just wanted to give Red Robin another $2.00 (to play gamepad) but couldn't do so.  - Bottom of buns on my and my youngest child's burgers were burnt. We didn't say anything to server. We just wanted to leave by that point.  - Wanted to order a beer. Server had no idea what draft beers were available and left to check. After 10 minutes I just walked to the bar and ordered my own beer to bring back to the table. Server never acknowledged that I had to get my own beer, even after I asked her for another!  - All 4 meals literally came with 4-5 fries. We were told they were cooking more so we asked for more when available. They never came. Again, at that point we just wanted to leave. So much for ""bottomless"" fries.  - When placing order asked waitress for sides of ""campfire"" sauce and the in-house ""hot ketchup"". She literally said, ""If I write it down it will confuse them in the kitchen, so remind me after your food comes."" We gave up and never said another word about it.  - Had to ask for refills every time...was never asked if we wanted any.  - If manager had stopped by our table once we would have mentioned our concerns to her. She didn't. We did, however, watch her sitting at a table talking with another employee for most of our time at the restaurant.  - Finally, when it came time to pay, I laid my credit card on the table and the server said, ""You'll need to use the pad for that."" I replied, ""I'd like to but both give an error message (as I detailed earlier when talking about how my children wanted to play games on the pad)."" Server said, ""They do those all the time,"" and took both pads away. Five minutes later she said neither pad was on the right table. After another few moments she found the ""right"" pads (one of which was clear on the other side of the restaurant) and asked me to use one of them to pay. Exasperated and ready to leave I said, ""Can't you just process our credit card?"" She said she couldn't and asked again that we use the pad. Really??  In short, we used to have pretty relaxing experiences at Red Robin. This time was anything but and it will be quite a while before we return, unfortunately. Employees clearly need additional customer service training at this location.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nicholasville,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

The last time we went to Red Robin, we were not overly impressed with the food, and I experienced digestive problems following the visit. However since our last visit years ago, my brother and his family had raved about their excellent experiences at this location. So, we decided to give it another try. We will not return to this restaurant again. The fries were excellent and the service was decent. Oh, and our daughter's corn dogs appeared to be OK. However, my hamburger was undercooked. I made it very clear that I wanted NO PINK in my hamburger. Unfortunately, at least part of my hamburger reminded me of the nearly-raw hamburgers my great-aunt's husband used to serve up every summer at his house in Georgia. The main reason we will not return to this restaurant is because of what my wife has gone through for the last 12 hours.

22,David G.,"Lexington, KY",65,151,177.0,3.0,2017-03-05,"Let me start out by saying that I don't fully get the gourmet chain burger idea. There are tons of great local burger restaurants in the city that charge a fraction of the cost of Red Robin with much better tasting burgers. The fact that Red Robin doesn't participate in Lexington Burger Week should indicate something to all of us. That said, I have to admit I like something about the ambiance in here. Can't exactly put my finger on what it is, but something puts me at peace in this joint. And that's a good thing, because the service is slow. It takes a really long time to get your meal. So you'd better enjoy the wait. Unfortunately, I ordered the Peppercorn Burger (waitress' recommendation), and the wait wasn't rewarded with an awesome burger. It wasn't cold, but very cool. It didn't have a lot of flavor to it ~ I'd call it close to unseasoned. The fries were pretty good, though.  They claim the fries are bottomless and the drink refills are endless, but let me give you the caveat. You need the waitress to get them for you. If she ain't around, there's nothing endless or bottomless to it. I was actually wondering at one point if they train them to avoid you after they've delivered your meal.  So, if you want to pay premium prices for ok burgers, have at it. This might be your place. The fries are good. I like the ambiance. The kids' meals are only $4.99. It ain't all bad in here.
