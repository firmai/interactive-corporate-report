NIcholas N.,"Westminster, CA",8,11,26,3.0,7/2/2017,Got a promotion coupon so stop here for dinner. Food was good but the prices compare to Cheesecake Factory are about the same but the portions are way smaller.  I would rather spend $$ at Cheesecake Factory than here. Pizza  prices are over price. Salads too. Wouldn't come back here just for pizza or salads.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20
Laureen C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",10,32,3,1.0,4/29/2017,"My mom and I were eating here tonight and my fiancé came in halfway through dinner solely to just pick something up from me, he wasn't staying, so he stood at the edge of our table for less than 30 seconds. One of the male employees (not sure if he was the manager or not, but he was not our waiter) walks over to the table and was like ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave, there's no soliciting"" -- the employee didn't even ask if he knew us before making such an INSULTING and RUDE assumption. Taken back by the command, my fiancé asked him why he assumed he was soliciting and told him he was here with me (pointing). We never received an apology. The male employee retreated back to his pow-wow of other waiters and gossiped about what just occurred. No apologies whatsoever!  I never pull the race card, but yes my fiancé is black, and yes he was surely targeted! Never going back! Corporate will hear from us. I understand people make mistakes, but this was handled and approached so so poorly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20
Sophia D.,"Westminster, CA",348,92,41,3.0,5/16/2016,"Decided to go here for dinner tonight since I had a gift card I got for graduation a year ago. Ordered the Waldorf chicken salad, Mac and cheese crisp, Thai chicken pizza and a Hawaiian pizza for my niece.  I thought everything we ordered was good but not as amazing as I thought it used to be. The salad had a nice amount of dressing and had candied walnuts, grapes, apples, Gorgonzola, and celery. The pizza was good, I just wished it came out a little bit hotter. The Mac and cheese crisp thing was not good, it had a funny taste and we had to take it back, so our kind server took it off our bill and apologized. Oh I forgot I did order dessert, the butter cake with ice cream and that was soft, buttery and warm. I enjoyed that since I've never had that before. Overall I think I would give this place 3.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20
Karah G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2017,"I've been here several times, with no issues. But tonight was just terrible. Our waiter took forever to take our order and when he did he was very unprofessional. When we got our food, not only was my pizza burnt badly on the bottom, but I couldn't even ask our waiter for a side of ranch because it took him 30 minutes to come over and ask us if we needed anything else and when he did, he said ""I'm not doing anything so do you guys need anything else?"". Just a terrible experience all around. Also worth noting, the restaurant was not busy. Will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20
Ally P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",89,8,1,1.0,6/28/2017,Went with my friends tonight and was totally shocked on how we where treated as PAYING! guest in the restaurant. Walk in didnt get greeted by a hostess had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes for someone to come over and to seat us. Get to our table and Emily was so slow! She took over 15 mins to take our order in that time we contemplated going somewhere else maybe we would had better treatment! My soup was horrible had no taste my friends pasta had way to much garlic in it and we will NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!! Maybe you guys need a trading day and get back on your A+ game!!

Jevonah K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",108,89,152,5.0,1/23/2017,"Went last night for a late night dinner and Emily, our server, was very professional. She didn't come to our table right away but apologized for it and never made us wait the rest of our meal. We appreciated her lovely personality and her attentiveness to our meal and refilling our waters and getting us out check and boxes to take home our uneaten pizza. She made sure my 5 cheese pizza came with pepperoni without any additional surcharges and my boyfriend's BBQ chicken pizza had plenty of chicken on it unlike the Burbank location we went last time. She made sure I got my points with the dough application and the appetizer WA sbrought first, before our meal, even though we ordered it first which I always stress about since some places forget to bring it out first but Emily made sure it came first and separately from our meal. We ordered the califlower BBQ appetizer which is always so amazing and tastes like chicken wings from heaven.

Lindsay D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,3.0,9/24/2017,"Disappointed in early lunch visit Friday. 3 tables occupied in the bar. Although we were seated first, we were last to get bread, which was dropped off (3 plates stacked) just before the meal. Mom's soup was just warm, but our waiter didn't check back with us to see how things were or fill my empty water glass. Check was delivered with no offer of dessert first. I hope he considers the meager tip may have been the lackluster service and not my cheapness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20
Emily Y.,"San Dimas, CA",229,1,,1.0,10/8/2017,"We arrived at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and asked for a table of 10. Note the restaurant was only around a third full. The hostess named Bri simply responded ""no we don't have room for you"" and upon asking for other alternatives, such as splitting our group in half, she said they couldn't do that either and we were more than welcome to go eat at a different restaurant. We are very disappointed in the rudeness and inability to accommodate customers who are even willing to be flexible and split up our party. We left and will likely not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20

Parking is usually a little difficult since it's located in the Bella Terra plaza.  Service was okay. It took a little while to get out waters and bread.  Wild Mushroom Pizza: This is my favorite pizza here. I know there's no meat, but it's so delicious. I get it with the truffle oil. My boyfriend really liked this despite being a meat lover!

CPK Fooled me once, with 2 egg rolls cut in half and calling 4 egg rolls but I forgave you... but this time, you have gone too far with up-charging for 5 TINY PIECES of cold mediocre cauliflower.

Nhung N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",600,185,244,3.0,8/27/2015,"I hardly eat here but when I do I usually get the tequila lime chicken pasta but I wasn't that hungry this time. I ordered the tortilla spring rolls which really were egg rolls. You get a sampler of any three flavors. There were three flavors to choose from: Mediterranean veggie, Thai chicken, and Baka chicken. I couldn't decide so I got one of each.  My favorite was the Thai chicken. The peanut sauce was very good, tasted like it could come from a Thai restaurant. My second would be the Baja but just because I like guacamole. My least liked would be the Mediterranean just because the cheese over powered all the veggies. It was also served with marinara sauce which is odd to me since I felt I should have been served with hummus or other sauce. It ended up tasting like a mozzarella cheese roll.  The reduced stars would mainly be from the service. It seems like waitress has forgotten about us. When it came time to get the check we waited for ten minutes with our empty plates just looking for her. The rolls are a good try though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20

I enjoy their soups and salads and even the salmon here was pretty good. Service was fine, food came out quickly. Portions are descent, but it is a bit pricey for chain restaurant food.

Peter V.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",883,199,835,3.0,3/21/2016,"Honestly, I'm thankful that I got a $100 CPK gift card for Christmas to use because I wouldn't really spend that much of my own money to eat here personally.  First of all, I'm not a big fan of mainstream restaurant chains. CPK, BJ's, etc...they all are not that great in my opinion. Second of all, all the food is way overpriced. Like seriously, I know food ain't cheap these days but the prices on the CPK menus were crazy expensive. Third, it was predominately Caucasian. Asians don't really spend that much money on food actually. Cheap is the way to go.  Since I had a $100 gift card, we tried to spend close to $100 as much as possible. We ended ordering three pizzas, one pasta dish, two half salads, and two drinks. I don't recall the names of the pizza but I posted the pictures on Yelp. My favorite would have to be the thin crusted pizza...it ended up being one of the cheapest dishes actually. The most expensive pizza that we ordered was the $16 one but like it honestly tasted the most basic. you could easily get that from Costco for so much cheaper haha. The salad were pretty basic too. The pasta was good but the portion was not generous at all. Cries. In the end, we pretty much spent $100 flat including tax. Yeah I don't think I will be coming back...but it was a nice fee meal hehe. Just seem plain and basic in all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=20

Juliet C.,"Westminster, CA",0,20,,1.0,3/23/2017,"My daughter and I went here at an off time. It was pre dinner time, around 4pm. The restaursnt was not busy but appeared fully staffed for dinner shift. We were seated in the bar (my child is 6) when all others were seated in restaurant.  A total of 6 people passed us by, some more than once each: each without so much as an acknowledgement. Busser, Server, Host, another Hostess. Host/Hostess and another employee chatted at the front.  Manager passed by and Bartender saw us.  After waiting at least 15 minutes without put existence being acknowledged; we went to Islands and experienced exceptional service. This restaurant is example of what not do do in customer service. I am not a huge Islands fan. However, I am a fan of decent service and my kid likes Islands. Ill be sticking with Islands and their exceptional service delivery.

Tanya P.,"Laguna Hills, CA",31,59,3,5.0,11/25/2017,"The last time I went to this California Pizza Kitchen, I ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps.  They arrived quickly and were totally delicious! Tip: Our server was really helpful and informative.  My friend had a number of questions about various menu items, and she answered all his questions throughly and professionally :-) Over and above the shrimp lettuce wraps, my friend and I shared the mahi mahi tacos, which were The Bomb!

Kent V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1003,294,698,3.0,12/4/2017,"I haven't eaten here in forever and now I remember why. I ordered take out from here last night for 2 people. I got their Hawaiian pizza, fire roasted veggie salad (added chicken) and an order of their split pea and barely soup and potato soup. The man on the phone said that each soup is good for 1 person. Before placing my order I checked their menu on there website via phone and nothing had prices next to it so when the guy said your total is $54 I was a little taken back but figured it would be a delicious meal.  The Hawaiian pizza I received was cold and average at best. When your restaurant has pizza in the name, you figure this would be the highlight of your meal, but nope. Any pizza from a local restaurant would have been better (Valentinos, Porkys, etc.). The salad was delicious, lots of veggies including artichoke hearts, avocado, corn, etc. The grilled chicken had a lot of flavor too but when I saw the price tag at 19.99. I was taken back. This is a pretty casual restaurant, even with the chicken added it shouldn't be more than $16. The soups were good but small portions....good enough for 1 bowl for 1 person and they were both priced at 7.99. Overpriced and not worth it for the small amount and quality.  The overpriced salad was the highlight of the meal lol. The pizza did absolutely nothing for us....little toppings, dry bland crust. You're better off getting pizza and salads at any local pizza joint for 1/2 the price... now I know for next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach
Michael T.,"Orange, CA",250,33,78,4.0,9/12/2017,"Decided to go here on a whim while driving down Edinger. The restaurant is located right off the 405 and Beach in the parking lot of Bella Tera.  Inside is clean and nice decor. Not a lot of people on a Tuesday night, which is never a bad thing (I hate crowded places). Some music but not too loud. Our server, Rafael, was polite and attentive. He always made sure we were taken care of.  The food came out pretty quickly. I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettucine ($14.99) and thought it was a little bland and needed more sauce. My girlfriend ordered the Pesto Cream Penne with Chicken and Shrimp ($12.69 + $7.50) which was actually quite good despite the tiny chicken bone on her first bite.  The total was about $41 for the 2 dishes and a diet coke. The food quality and portion is about right for the price.

Chris D.,"Garden Grove, CA",509,896,5326,4.0,8/8/2017,"I've always been a fan of CPK.  I think their pizzas are very good and they have an interesting variety of them.  Since I count calories I tend to go to chain restaurants more often these days since they have the nutrition guides available.  They're not as good as non-chain restaurants but I'm willing to sacrifice a bit for the convenience of knowing how many calories I""m consuming.  I try to eat fairly healthy but I want to enjoy myself too and nothing is more enjoyable in the culinary world than pizza.  I'll can enjoy a $25 pizza at Mozza's or a pizza hotpocket, I'm not picky.  I think CPK has really improved over the years.  The toppings are very high quality and they even offer Nueske bacon now which in my opinion is the best there is.  An entire pizza is about 1200 calories for majority of them which is high but since it's the weekend it's acceptable to me as long as I'm smart about the rest of the day.  The pizza's are large and very filling.  Donna is always trying to convince me to split a pizza and a salad but eff that... I want to consume a pizza not lettuce. I've been to Seal Beach, Long Beach, and this Huntington Beach location.  Even though foodwise they are all the same I think this location is the nicest inside with the most room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach

Ken G.,"El Cajon, CA",38,38,2,1.0,11/26/2017,"Staying at a hotel across the street, we decided to order some curbside pickup. I ordered a pizza and my wife, the shrimp scampi zucchini pasta. Curbside pickup about 5 minutes longer than the time given. The girl brings out the drinks and a large bag of food. Tells me to hang on while she waits on the pizza to finish. She brings the pizza and I leave. Get to the room. The first thing I pull out is a box with a small pizza in it. Next another small box with a pizza in it and finally the pasta. Wrong Pasta!!! Instead of Shrimp Scampi Zucchini, we think we ended up with Bolognese Spaghetti. Moving onto my pizza, remember the one I had to wait for, it was cold.

We wanted chicken on the Margherita, and our waitress Alejandra was happy to help us customize the pizza. When our orders arrived, we noticed that the Margherita didn't have any chicken on it; however, we didn't mind because the pizzas were good-sized portions. Our waitress Alejandra offered to give us extra chicken on the side, but we said that it was fine. After a few minutes, Laura (possibly the store manager) came to our table and asked us if we really were fine with the pizza, and offered to bake us another pizza for us. Still, we said that we were fine, and didn't need them to bake us another pizza. A couple minutes later, Laura came out with a fresh new pizza, saying that the chef had made us another pizza at no additional cost. She then said that she took the pizza off of our bill because it wasn't perfect the first time. We never asked for anything, much less for another free pizza, yet they went above and beyond to make sure that our visit to their pizza kitchen was absolutely amazing.

I've been to the other big , popular fish place within walking distance and was super disappointed three different times over the years with their halibut, comparing its size, taste and price, I said forget it. Then started my quest for a good halibut nearby.  And I found it at California Pizza Kitchen. Who knew.  Over the years I've had the salads which are very good, the pizzas, I like the roasted veggie, my bf likes the pepperoni with A side of fresh, chopped oregano.  I tried their seasonal menu. One item was root vegetables with chicken and it was so dry, so forget that. That was my only stay away from item.  They have good red wines, and I tried a mixed vodka drink that was made with three olives cherry vodka and sprite.. I don't know what it was called , but it was so good. I tried to copy it at home using 7-up and limes.  Lunch times have a special with a soup and side pizza which is a pretty good deal. Service is fast enough.

I didn't want a salad and a pizza. I also wanted a dry martini... although I don't drink anymore  (I promise, oh my Guardian Angel). Ok, Maybe I've earned one after the martini I had last week at Smokey Joe's . I've been hanging out with parents for a week.  It's been uh, interesting.  Anyway, CPK has a pizza which is half pizza, half salad.  Are you kidding me?  it was a pretty darn good pizza and sure enough, was topped by salad stuff. Greens and cheesy things.  By the way, the martini was so good, I spilled it. Our good server Andrew was kind enough to replace it.  Oh, and I spilled the first martini about half way through it's lifespan on the table.

Jasmine R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,17,,5.0,4/23/2017,"Came here for lunch on Easter Sunday and we were worried it was going to be packed due to the holiday. Surprisingly the restaurant was fairly dead when we walked in (as was the rest of Bella Terra, it seemed). Yet from that moment, the boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised how quick the service was given how none of the staff could have been ""in the zone"" as the restaurant had been pretty empty for the last several hours as confirmed to us by our host who sat us immediately upon us walking through the door. Not a minute after being seated our waiter was very prompt at taking our drink order and getting us some complimentary bread and dip oil. He was very attentive throughout the entire meal with refills, more complimentary bread when he saw we were done with our first round, and later, boxes and the check. It was one of the smoothest restaurant service experiences I've had in recent memory. As for the food, everything was perfect. We started with the Club Avocado Rolls which were perfectly crispy and came with more than enough dipping sauce (don't you hate it when you get a tiny cup of sauce for an entire order?). For our entrees, I decided to try something other than my old standby, the classic BBQ Chicken Pizza, and ordered the Tequila Chicken Fettucine and my BF ordered his usual, the Jambalaya Fettucine. Oh my, I believe it's going to be hard coming back to California Pizza Kitchen to get pizza after I tried the Tequila Chicken Fettucine. The pasta was perfectly al dante and the sauce was magical. Definitely getting this next time. My BF's Jambalaya Fettucine was delicious and spicy like usual and he's glad to say that he's never been disappointed with his usual order, at least at this particular location (we can't say that's been the case at other CPKs we've been to).

CPK is now cutting corners and has gone cheaper with dough, but offers new crusts. The new dough is quite different and a bit off-putting. The tostada pizza is pretty much an actual americanized tostada, but with less toppings here. The chicken was skimped. It disgusted my boyfriend and they immediately explained the new dough to him. They then gave him a non-pizza item. I was okay with my white pizza with apple wood smoked bacon. The dough used is a bit chewier than usual, so you may have a bit of trial and error here.

Trisha V.,"San Francisco, CA",409,191,254,3.0,1/19/2016,"Solid place to eat, but I generally find that most chain restaurants aren't that amazing, to begin with. My aunt ordered us the Thai Crunch salad and avocado eggrolls for appetizers. The Thai Crunch salad was very Americanized (to be expected, frankly) so it wasn't that great. I did like the avocado eggrolls, unexpectedly. It had good flavor and textures, and I would order it again if I ever decide to come back to CPK. For pizzas, we ordered their seasonally inspired sunny-side up egg and potato pizza with bacon, The Works, and the garlic chicken. My favorite of the three was the garlic chicken. The Works was subpar and the egg pizza was slightly disappointing. I feel as if the toppings on the egg pizza could have been more evenly distributed. If you have a choice though, get your pizzas with thin crust! It is so much better than their regular crust. Finally, for dessert, we had the red velvet cake and the chocolate souffle cake. I liked both but they weren't extraordinary. Overall, you can count on CPK to not have offensive food. However, if you're going to spend $20ish per person, I think you're better off going to Korean BBQ or a smaller restaurant in Costa Mesa. The food scene in this part of OC is pretty good that going to CPK should be a last resort kind of deal. Like I said, CPK is solid but not worth it frankly.

Michael E.,"Garden Grove, CA",423,63,35,5.0,7/19/2015,"Pizza is something you can literally walk around the corner and find and be pretty satisfied with. What sets this place apart from the rest is their level of service, and friendly staff that makes people repeat customers. It's located inside the Bella Terra area so there's plenty of parking, they remodeled the place pretty recently so everything looks more modern and clean. Expect to be greeted immediately, they're very attentive here and if you don't believe me you'll see for yourself when you visit. Ask to sit in Andrew' section, he'll take care of you.  I feel like the first couple of moments when you meet your server set a precedence on how the rest of the meal goes. Andrew was easy to talk to and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. Service was fast and Andrew was knowledgable on the menu whenever we had any questions. I'm still kind of upset that they got rid of the Sante Fe Pizza, but the spicy chipotle chicken is a pretty good alternative. Good amount of heat, and they don't skimp on the meat. Mushroom sausage is a close second too. Again, the biggest difference between good and GREAT servers are the ability to make a connection with your guests and make them want to come back for more. I'll definitely be revisiting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=80

They give you some fresh bread and olive oil with spices to start out. My favorite item is the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage hand tossed pizza. The crust is crispy and never soggy, and they are generous with the cheese and toppings. It always has a great flavor. The small portion of the Caesar Salad is actually on the larger size! You could split it if you want a true small portion.

Not sure how long it's been on the menu, but keep it around and I'll keep coming back.   Other that than, yes this CPK is in Bella Terra which has now grown into a shopping/dining/apartment living destination so traffic gets crazy and parking is difficult, but it's still better than finding a place to park in LA.  ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=80

Food was cool especially when you hungry. I enjoyed that they wasn't stingy on the cheese.  Negative point is that you paying for personal pizzas at $12-16 a pie. 3 stars only cause of the service 1 star for the food tasting the way it should when fresh. 5th star missing due to the price.  You can go to Blaze or Pie-ol-ogy get any amount of toppings for $8. But go to Blaze lol ever since pieology went franchise they pizza quality went down and taste so weak and blah like cheap dough.  Sorry CPK but I always never liked your prices and only went here due to my friends choosing it. Even in the early 2000s I hated your prices. Pricey for a small pizza when $16 I can get more quality and quantity. I wish you well and hope you know 4/5 stars is the truth and not being bias on my experience.

A couple of nights ago, I had ordered the Habanero Carnitas, and I'll tell you one thing:  If you don't like your carnitas spicy, LEAVE THE SALSA BE (the habanero salsa came on the side) unless you want to have your tongue burned.  Ahem...anyway, the carnitas were tender, and the vegetation (onions, spinach [pesto], etc.) was perfect.  And to the fact that I rarely to almost never consume the pizza crust, this crust was actually pretty good.  Not too chewy, and not too soggy either.

We were greeted & seated right away from the employees who were very friendly and kind. The staff were very attentive and helpful with everything. We were served our drinks immediately and then were asked if we were ready to order. We got our drinks which were strawberry & mango and just a plain strawberry lemonade yet the flavor was very bitter and more sour than usual, very sour... After asking if we could get more sugar on the side, they offered to remake our drinks and were super kind about it. We just asked for sugar packs instead just so we wouldn't give them a hard time. After adjusting the drinks with the sugar, the flavor was much sweeter but it just wasn't the same as the usual house strawberry lemonade. As much as we didn't want to give them a hard time, we asked politely if we could just substitute or change our drinks. We ordered mango and strawberry ice teas and the drink was made perfectly this time around. Food wise we had ordered the chicken tequila fettucine, half bbq chicken and half pepperoni whole pizza, and a chicken Cobb salad. The food was great and we had no problems at all.

Again, impressive!  Then, apart from the awesome phil, we had our server... ROXY! Extremely helpful & patient with our huge party. With it being my first time, I was uncertain of what to order (apart from pizza) & I didn't end up liking the pasta dish. She offered to bring a new dish of my choice without additional charge... I passed & she gave me soup -on the house. She was very personable with our party & never seemed in a hurry or rush to get to other things. Excellent service here!!

Their pizzas and salads are the best options when you come here, while the rest of the menu is generally just ok.  The pizza's have recently changed recipe because the chain has decided to go more ""artisan."" With this the pizza crust has changed a little, they have more toppings then they use to, and the toppings are not as evenly placed or as evenly cut as they used to be.

The Reisling was refreshing, the others went well with our meal. - AND they finally got rid of that complimentary spongy wonder bread and now they give fresh, warm sourdough bread with olive oil dipping (Nice change up CPK!)

For more than one occasion, I've given this place a chance in improving our experiences there. I've never really had a problem waiting for a table. And most of the servers there were real kind and courteous. However, what makes this place less extravagant is the delivery of the food. I'm vegetarian and for a number of times, I would inform the servers specific instructions to be certain that there won't be ANY meat on my plate. Unfortunately, more than 70% of the time... there would always be at least one or two pieces of chicken found in my entree. What makes it worse is that I'd take my girlfriend (who is also vegetarian) here and she too would have the same experience. On one specific occasion, me and my girlfriend had ordered a salad. Surprisingly enough, there was no meat found lurking in our food. However, we found a strand of hair instead. We kindly asked our server to have our salad replaced, which she was more than happy to. A few minutes later, the manager came back and tries to accuse us that we had left the strand of hair in the salad... explaining that none of their cooks has long hair and all always wait hair pieces to hold their hairs up while they cook.  That was the final straw... I don't think I'll ever go back there after that specific incident.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=180

If you are looking for something light and sweet then the Mesmerizing Margherita is your girl! One BITE and you'll be HOOKED! The service was below average at this location. The server was MIA the majority of the time. We had to remind her to bring our condiments multiple times.  On another note, she got our bill wrong and took FOREVER to correct it.

It has always been an enjoyable dinner everytime i've been there and thats starting from about 10 years ago..? The last time i went, the fettucine noodles were a bit undercooked and the sauce for the chicken dumplings was a bit too tangy. I must say their complimentary bread there is good though.

My Hun and I tried this location out one night celebrating a promotion. We walked in at about 430 (usually when business is not very busy) and asked the hostess for a table for two. She says Okay give us one minute we will clean one for you. Sure, as I glance around the 20 empty booths in front of me. We waited for about 5 minutes til we were seated. Our server greeter us and didn't tell us his name (lucky for him). We asked him for waters to start and a bowl of soup. He brings that out then asks if we were ready to order. I asked if he can bring us a side of lemons then we will have an answer for him! Somebody else brings the lemons out for us a couple of minutes later. 10 minutes pass no signs of our server. We finished our soup and sat there waiting and waiting. So finally I grab another lady's attention and ask if she can put our orders in for us. She was very sweet and did just that. Our ""server"" then kept walking back and forth from our table but never checked in with us. We wanted to order drinks but weren't able to because he seriously never came back. Someone else drops off our food and still the server did not come by. Even though we were seated right next to literally right next to the p.o.s. System where he was putting in his orders. About two bites left in our food LO AND BEHOLD our server speaks to us!!! We ask him for the check (since we didn't know when we would ever see him again) and guess what....someone else closed it out for us!!! Man I did not want to tip that guy but I wanted to be fair to the people that he will tip out later that did help us. Being in the industry myself, I understand you get caught up at tables and things happen but the guy walked by us about a dozen times. He could have easily stopped for two seconds! Meanwhile, in front of us there was about four cpk employees eating and talking in front of us. People kept stopping by to talk to them and they were kinda loud. I wouldn't mind if I wasn't out celebrating and could hear your voice through my conversations. But really, how unprofessional. The food was pretty good but service is a big part of going out to eat.

Can't go wrong with that.  I also love this place because they donated a bunch of pizza boxes for an art lesson I am doing in my classroom.  My students and I really appreciate it!!!

As the years passed the quality fell off, the service style changed and  what remained was a disappointment. Yesterday we decided to try it again, and I am really glad we did. From what we were told the new CEO is very hands on and is very involved in the resurrection. Every table was greeted by the manager, a very nice touch. The new bread, a welcome change baked every ten minutes or so.  The food quality seems up, the revised menu is a welcome change and a big bonus they switched after years of being a Pepsi house. They now offer Coke products including Coke Zero.. Bonus. Add in some very personable service from our waiter and overall we were very pleased and will be back.

Shawn M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12,14,2,1.0,6/6/2014,"I will spare a depth description of being served raw food, a lack of apologies by anyone in a managerial position. Here is the email I sent to their management and to their corporate offices. messing up what I ordered is one thing, Serving me raw food and management to engaged in conversations with bar patrons is ridiculous and entirely inappropriate. In fairness I will alter this review to show what response they have given to me if I should ever hear back.  To Whom It May Concern: Yesterday June 5th 2014 I ate at your Huntington Beach location 7851 Edinger Ave at around 7 PM. My previous experiences eating at this and other CPK locations has always been good and the quality of food has also been good. However yesterday the management and cooking staff failed miserably and I can assure you I will not be returning to this location ever again. The issue surrounds what I ordered and the way in which is was cooked, or should I say in this case, dangerously undercooked. I ordered the Chicken Picatta, something I tend to order often when I visit CPK. David, our server who was the only pleasant part of this meal was attentive and brought my food to me and the rest of my party in a very timely and professional manner. I began to eat the dish and got pretty well through it before I realized that the chicken I was eating was raw inside. While I understand there can be some occasional miscommunications with the kitchen staff over the timeliness of the orders and the items within an order, this was ridiculous. The other two people in our party of three got their food first, mine came about 4 minutes later. There should be no reason since I was the last one served for my food to not have been fully cooked. This is inexcusable to me and David our server was not to blame. When I brought the issue to his attention he was very quick to remedy it and what appeared to be just a host, came by to let me know the new piece of chicken and pasta was being cooked.  What is annoying about this to me and what I hope you will address to me is why a member of management did not personally come to my table and apologize? I would have understood in spite of concerns I might have for my health given that I have no idea how much raw chicken I had consumed. However no one from the CPK management team did so. Perhaps I can save you some time in wondering what your management was doing, they were standing at the bar for the length of our entire meal 1 hour and 3 minutes talking with two patrons at the bar. The conversations must have been quite important to not leave this post for that long of a time and certainly eclipsed the need to possibly go and personally address a guest who was just served raw poultry. I hope the conversation was worth the damage to your reputation, I am in the service industry and while I know your probably not the least bit concerned with Yelp or other venues where people can appraise their visits and give honest feedback, I feel many more consumers need to know what they can expect if something should go wrong at your restaurant.  I feel it is ridiculous I should come in and spend money somewhere on food, have it be served dangerously raw to me and not even have a member of your management say something as little as ""we are sorry"" to me. This location is in an area where there are several options for eating and considering the amount of time I spend in that area and the fact I live in Huntington I guess I will spend my money elsewhere. I most certainly will not be returning to your location given this ridiculous situation that I was willing to let go if your management had been able to pull themselves away from whatever life changing conversation they were having in order to say sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=160
Eliz T.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,57,,5.0,10/16/2014,"My family and I eat here at least once a week. The food is great and the service is even better. We were lucky enough to get Roxy one evening and we've been asking for her ever since, we even wait until she has a table in her area just so we can experience her phenomenal service. She is what makes this place the best. She anticipates the needs of her guests and always seems to know what you want before you ask. She always has a smile on her face and is so genuinely nice. I can't eat anywhere else anymore as the service just doesn't match up. Don't get me wrong, the food at CPK is very good, but I think Roxy's service makes it even better. It really is a pleasant environment to dine and while I am praising Roxy quite a bit, her colleagues also seem to be very on point and friendly. It's always such a pleasure to eat here.

Katheline L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",173,93,171,3.0,4/15/2010,"So, yesterday after putting out my thread on any good places to eat at Bella Terra, i decided to go to King's Fish House. When i went there around 7 o clock there was a 45 minute wait. I wanted to try somewhere new, but I decided no meal is worth eating past 8. Went to CPK with a no wait line at all. The place was pretty packed, but i was able to get a table with my boyfriend and his two friends. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. He checked up on us frequently. i ordered the chicken club sandwich again. (focassia garlic and cheese bread with chicken, lettuce, avacado, and bacon ) w. a side of sedona tortilla soup. ) When it came out i was super excited to just go crazy on it, and take that first big CRUNCH like last time. SADLY it was NOT crunchy at all, it was soft and soggy... i was able to bend the bread like it was nothing. I was so disappointed, i knew if i continued to eat; i would have left upset and not content. I HATE complaining, but I had to do it. I kindly told my waiter can he take it back, and make the bread toasty because it was just too soggy. He was sorry, brought it to the back, and got it toasted. It came back out to me how i wanted. Nice golden brown with a crusty exterior. It was way better, and he even said, "" wow that does look better"" . I was a little disappointed that i really enjoyed my food last time, and this time it was somewhat a drag, but it's all good.  Better luck next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=160

I've never been a fan of funny pizzas, like the BBQ Chicken pizza but some of the group seemed to love them. I had the fettuccine with the creamy garlic sauce and paid an extra $4 for chicken. To be honest, it was unimpressive.....you could tell by looking at the color of the noodles on top that it sat under a heat lamp for a couple minutes....and $4 for an extra ounce or two of chicken seemed a bit much. The creamy garlic sauce was actually kinda bland...I considered returning it for a moment....but didn't want to wait for another dish. It wasn't horrible....just not up to par with most restaurants that I'd order this at.  On the plus side........the service was terrific and everyone else seemed happy with their meals. We got a seat in about 15 minutes...not bad for a Saturday night.  Also there's a $5 coupon that comes up on Yelp when you check in.

It is one of our quick restaurant picks, but I always find myself hoping for more than what it actually delivers. You know when you read a menu... and it sounds good, but when you finally get it, it is as described, but something just isn't right? I always get that feeling. For example, the description for the Thai Pizza sounds great, interesting, and flavorful. However, when I get it... it is exactly as described, but just doesn't have that extra kick to it. The flavors just aren't distinct. They kind of roll around together. You end up wondering what you just ate and if you should be feeling satisfied. I feel the same about their other dishes. They definitely have interesting ideas, but the flavors need to be more distinguishable... the same goes for the texture of the food. Their food tends to be on the saltier side, which leaves my tongue a little numb at the end of the meal. I really recommend getting a salad and a pizza to share. It helps to balance it out. Just don't go crazy and get the Thai salad with a Thai pizza.  I do enjoy their appetizers quite a bit though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=240

I haven't been here for quite awhile, but upon my return, the hostess was super nice, made small talk with me as i was seated to my booth. Once i was seated, my server came up and asked if i wanted any drinks or appetizers. I think her name is Kelly (unsure though), but she was very nice. She came back with water, then took our order. While we were eating she would always check up on us. When i was about to leave, i didn't want to waste my strawberry lemonade so I asked for a cup, instead, she brought me out a brand new one!  Made my morning (i wake up around noon). She was so nice and such great service!  (: On to the food, for appetizer we got the White Corn Guacamole + Chips (i liked it, it's pretty small, but it's good): avocado, corn, bean in some kind of sauce with tortilla chips, for main course, i ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with chicken (not too bad, a little creamy, didn't finish it in one serving), dessert: strawberry shortcake (new item: i didn't like the biscuit much, strawberries are good with the ice cream, but pretty sweet for me) After today, I would think of coming back more often now. I love the service and enjoyed my meal. (: BTW, it gets pretty busy around lunch time, good thing i came a little before noon and got a booth right away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=200

Leyna K.,"Garden Grove, CA",33,49,13,3.0,2/28/2012,"This CPK is one of the better ones. I just really hate their revolving door. I don't know why they had to split it into four. Makes it so damn annoying to walk through.   I haven't been here in a while but I hear they have little screens at the tables that you can use to order and pay now? I'll go check it out one of these days.  Service here is pretty much the same as in any other chain pizza-pasta restaurant.   They servers are nice and they'll come check on you from time to time. Nothing exceptional.  I always order the roasted garlic chicken pizza, and sometimes, the garlic cream fettuccine. Both are about $10, if I remember correctly. I like how they make the pizzas here. The crust is thin, but still thick enough so that it's not crunchy and charred. The fettuccine tastes okay, but it gets boring after a few bites. I had this brownie and ice cream thing once and it was good, but not worth the price. It's a pretty good place for lunch and dinner if you're feeling like having some extra ""fancy"" pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=200

Corey V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",240,25,29,4.0,8/18/2013,"Being from Chicago, a pizza that is less than an inch thick and topped with foofoo like barbecue sauce, pineapples, chicken, etc is a joke. I tried CPK kiosks rushing through airports and always laughed at the pizza and was turned off by the crappy sandwiches and salads. I actually gave away a $100 gift card to CPK because I was convinced they were all just like the lousy airport kiosks. So one day my friend that I gave the gift card to and I stumbled upon this place and I gave into the invite. It surprised me how nice this place was. I even tried the thin crust margarhita pizza and liked it. The menu selection is good and everyone in our party enjoyed their meal.

Alex V.,"Westminster, CA",1033,330,189,4.0,4/29/2011,"4 stars, this being said I base this review on what I ate there. The Chipotle Chicken pizza there is pretty awesome, I got it thin crust which made me not feel like I ate an entire pizza after eating an entire pizza. Service there is pretty standard, helpful with a smile, nothing out of the ordinary and not shitty at all.  Another plus is there's tv's everywhere, if you're into sports, not that I am, tonight you could have easily been watching 10 tall dudes huffing and puffing trying to get an orange ball in a hoop that's 10 feet up.  CPK def did a good job of giving you a bunch of easy to understand pizza's not like some spots I've been in LA where I can't even spell the ingredients because it's so fancy.  My sister did the dasterdly deed of getting a piece of red velvet cake for dessert. Good god, this thing was huge, no wonder one piece of that is the same caloric count as an entire meal. I had 2 small bites so I didn't feel too shitty for eating it, especially after consuming an entire pizza, and not even on cheat day mind you. So yes, if you want a good chain pizza place for sit down, that doesn't have a bunch of shitty arcade games, this is probably the place for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=200

Not the server's fault, just spread too thin. I watched two different parties of two wait at the bar until they finally left for lack of greeting. I've been a long time loyal customer, but never experienced such a crappy visit as this evening. Pizza was still nice. But if you're sucker enough to spend $15 on the ""Roasted Veg Salad"",  expect a poorly dressed handful of wilted, browning and stale lettuce with a tablespoon or two of unrecognizable paste of eggplant and roasted pepper. Oh, nearly forgot the teaspoon of ""roasted corn""... There was supposed to be asparagus in here, but it was MIA. Add a couple sorry and dry artichoke hearts (""warmed"" so I know they made this train wreck to order...) and you're looking at maybe a $0.75 food cost. MAJOR RIPOFF $$$! The server seemed surprised when I asked for a little more dressing, and wow did we wait on that request. This place used to rock it. The $80 bill leaves me looking for a new go-to.

She was super hungry.  We had the Korean BBQ beef tacos for appetizers also but it was way too spicy for me but my friends loved it. I loved how fresh the salad tasted and the pizza was yum yum delicious and juicy....perfect dinner for what I was craving.  The BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy and the pineapples were juicy as well.  Our dessert was pretty good...a nice hefty serving of vanilla bean ice cream with a chocolate souffle and loads of chocolate syrup.  The souffle was very chocolatey. The artwork in the place was pretty cool. It has painted CPK boxes framed on the wall all over the restaurant.  Very nice.  The service was great!

We started with the lettuce wrap appetizer as well as the spinach artichoke dip. The lettuce wraps were excellent. The artichoke dip was nothing special, and the chips it came with seemed a little stale. Most of my family got pizza. I got the club pizza and was pretty underwhelmed by it. All the flavors were there, but it was lacking. It is supposed to come with hand-tossed crust (I got the wheat crust) and I was disappointed because it seemed super thin. I was hoping ""hand-tossed"" meant it would be more traditional crust, but it was thin, overly chewy and difficult to eat. My boyfriend got the garlic chicken pizza and while the flavors were okay, there was no sauce at all. Just melted cheese with chicken, onions, and garlic on a thin, tough crust. Meh.

The hostess made us feel very welcome and sat us in a nice booth, right away and away from the cold.  Roxanne, our server came over right away as well, greeted us warmly and took our beverage order. We explained that we might order an appetizer but since we were unfamiliar with your menu we asked for some bread to tide us over which she brought right away, along with some delicious flavored olive oil! Yum! After tasting it we were intrigued and when Roxanne checked back to see if we were ready to order we got in a really fun conversation with her about it, the type of conversation where you realize you're going to have a lovely meal because your sever loves her job, cares about her customers and is really fun, to boot! She was very  knowledgeable, explained what seasoning they put in the olive oil and that it is made fresh every day! Upon our request, she was even gracious enough to give us the brand of olive oil you use. We told her we still weren't quite ready to order so she said she would check back.  We were having so much fun talking and tasting and enjoying the bread and olive oil! Roxanne came back in a timely manner and again, being very knowledgeable and professional answered all our questions about the menu. She said that she would recommend what we were considering so we placed our order. Roxanne must have noticed that we finished our bread and was sweet enough to bring us more and more olive oil, too!  We ordered the lettuce wraps and we did not have to wait long at all! They were absolutely delish! We loved the ginger-sesame sauce and me, being a spice nut, I asked if CPK had any kind of hot sauce. Roxanne offered two kinds and I went wild over the habanero one! It tasted homemade but I forgot to ask. It was a decent portion but when we ran out of lettuce Roxanne cheerfully brought us more. Gotta get my veggies! LOL! Well, we had an amazing meal! Roxanne could not have been nicer and checked back several times. She took care of all our needs and even brought containers so we could take home our bread and olive oil! What a sweet gesture! Roxanne is top notch and definitely a KEEPER!!! Thanks, Roxanne for making our evening so enjoyable! You ROCK Roxanne! You deserve a raise and to be employee of the month (if you have that? Ha!)!

Ryan F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",107,129,1,4.0,3/15/2009,"When this place first opened, it had a lot of kinks to work out. Waiters were poor, the food was slow, and they routinely messed up orders. Now that it's been around for a few years, the whole establishment has improved significantly. If you're familiar with the CPK menu, this location will give you more of the same. Protip #1: Parking for this location is typically horrible (it's part of a huge mall). You might be inclined to park near the building on a Friday or Saturday, but don't. Try parking closer to the Staples and cross the street. Protip #2: If you order take-out, check your order before leaving (literally dig through the takeout bag).

Ok, this is where I went from curious about CPK to *crosses fingers to make a religious symbol* back, BACK AWAY FROM ME, BEAST! Honestly, I had an open mind going in. I really did. I almost chose a burger place but I decided, hey, why not - let's try this cute little commercialized joint with my grandparents after a night of celebrating how I got my scholarship. The garlic shrimp pizza I got destroyed my stomach first of all. And everything was so decadent and outrageous - I just wanted a normal pizza for chrissakes! My old-school family was equally confused at what to do... but they ordered fairly normal ""flavors"".. and didn't get sick like I did. If there's one thing that I'm careful about, is that if I throw up or feel incredibly horrid after a meal, I stay away from that type of food forever. Not just ""oh give it a month"" or ""try something similar at a completely different place"". No, I never try it EVER again if it made me even slightly sick.

I'll say everytime i come here i order the same 3 things, especially if i come with friends i make them order what i want to eat because no one ever complains about what i like to eat because i only eat delicious stuff. Hell ill tell you what u need to order and you'll fall in loveeeee with it!! Ok lets start with pasta YOU HAVE TO TRY the CHICKEN TEQUILA FETTUCCINE.  It's absolutely perfect in every sense because if i dont have to season the pasta that means its PERFECT!  It's a spinach fettuccine in this oh so orgasmic savory creamy, fresh cilantro in a tequila-lime and jalapeño sauce very inriched flavor espcially if you  squeeze  lime in it, oh geez i remember when i first had it i came back for dinner to have it again it was that memorable to my taste buds! If you want a REALLY good salad always get the thai crunch salad, it's a perfect salad away from the ordinary bland american crap.  The mix of the peanut sauce with lime-cilantro sauce but mixing the two gives you this sweet and not quite sour but savory purfect mix of two dressing to make a good salad, but sometimes i notice they are stingy on the chicken probably the econmonys fault. but the best salad ever!! also NEVER get the Moroccan chicken salad its crap! and gross. oh miso salads pretty good too but thai crunch wins! For pizza i had a good amount of different types but my favorite is the sweet and spicy italian sausages, maybe im bias on this pizza cause this girl LOVES SAUSAGE! but yeah if your gonna order a pizza here dont get something lame like pepperoni, explore your taste buds and try the different arrays of taste for pizza. but if u want really good pizza go to Bj's across the street best pizza ever! So yeah those are the 3 things i always order with a sugar free peach ice tea also good. One thing.. the service god i must of gotten the worst waitress ever twice in a row, same waitress, with a different party of ppl on different days.  I have so say she was like what philipino or something she made me want to complain to the manager and when tipping i wanted to tip her a note saying ""HERE'S A TIP, LEARN TO BE A BETTER WAITRESS OR YOU'LL NEVER GET GOOD TIP"" ill say i came here sat in the table and it took her 5 minutes to greet us and get ask what drinks we wanted then another 15 minutes to get our drinks infact we got our drinks right before we got our food. then she never brought us bread untill i had to ask her, everyone was starving too, oh and she never brought us straws when we asked her after we got our drinks. SHE NEVER EVER EVER refilled any of our drinks and took forever to get my condiments of ranch, dijion sauce and red pepper, SERIOUSLY?!?! GEEZ THE RESTAURANT WASN'T BUSY AND YOUR NOT UNDERSTAFFED WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU GIRL!?!?!?! i hope she got fired because the next time i went to eat there and i got her it was like de javu, but this time i was with my friends and not my parents so giving her no tip was easy. other than that the other servers are cool just dont get that one girl u'll know if you get her because she'll make your experience terrible but then again i been to cpk over 50 times and the service is usally subpar to good except that one waitress, but the food will always be good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=260

The wait was one of the first things my party noticed. Appetizers took about 15-20 minutes to arrive (lettuce chicken wraps) and our pizzas came out 15 minutes after (so 30 minutes from time of order). Another negative is the pizza I *always* get when I go to CPK is the Roasted Chicken Garlic - they ""ran out"" today. How do you run out of a pizza? I thought everything was made from scratch. If that's the case, how can you not make more? It's not like I went on a slow night, it was Sunday night.  I ordered the next best looking type of pizza on there - the Spinach Artichoke and Chicken. When it came out the crust was nearly burnt, it was hard as tack and I barely managed to finish the whole thing.  Our waiter was great, and I know it's not his fault the kitchen failed to produce probably one of their more popular pizzas, nor was it his fault the food turned out crappy.

When we sat down at our booth, we both noticed that there are mini ""kiosks"" where you can scroll thru the menu, read news online and also pay for your bill. Pretty neat. For my meal, I ordered the Pepperoni pizza with wheat crust (boring, I know but I wanted to keep it simple). I've had this before at the Irvine location and it sucked but I was pleasantly surprised that this time around, the pizza tasted fresh and the dough had a good, chewy texture with a hint of sweetness.

James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1105,935,1830,3.0,2/21/2010,"I've decided to give CPK another chance since casting it off around 2006? Yes, if you're looking for a fantastic meal, then you're at the wrong place. But it does deliver in getting you full and semi pleased with what you ate. The artichoke dip here was definitely bland, almost no seasoning went into making it, and I could tell that there was a lot more oil/grease than there probably shold have been. I tried the hawaiian pizza and the pesto penne pasta. The pizza was okay, decent size, thinner crust, but nothing I felt was out of this world. I actually enjoyed my pasta, just enough sauce to coat the pasta, and tasted light. 2.50 to add chicken?!? bleh. And as mentioned, you have to say you want bread in order to get it. Pretty weird if you ask me especially since the server could easily say ""would you like some bread"" instead of making patrons think weird things about the chain restaurant. P.S. this location has a nice open feel to it, and I guess CPKs in general are decorated nicely inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=120

Dominic B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",101,20,,1.0,6/23/2013,"Tonight, sunday night at 7:20 walk in and sit at the bar. It was not busy in the restaurant but not slow either. Sat at the bar, just myself and waited for about 5 minutes.  A gentleman wearing a blue dress shirt saw me and without hesitation came over to greet. Got me a water and communicated with another gentleman behind the bar, most likely the bartender.  The bartender then comes over hands me a menu and rudely says do you know what you want to order, as if he had something better to do. I very politely said no I will just need a minute. Spent about a minute or two looking at the menu and made my selection. The bartender walked past me probably about two times. Not once making eye contact. I then realized maybe I should close my menu to signify I am ready so I closed the menu.  The bartender walked again by me twice his head was up and i am pretty sure he saw me. I waited another 5 minutes with my menu closed and looked over to my left where the patio is. The bartender is talking with a female crew member. That just about did it for me. Thank you gentleman in the blue dress shirt for starting me off and telling your crew member to take care of me, it's a shame he didn't follow through with his responsibility.  If I was a female, the bartender would have probably followed through. 3 reasons why someone doesn't do something; don't know, can't do, and don't care.

I tried the cream of asparagus soup and was overwhelmed with joy. The grilled veggie salad is one of my favorites (sans avo, of course). Add shrimp or salmon to it to beef it up a bit. For some reason the salmon is uncannily good here. Especially added to a salad. The artichoke dip is also nice. I know artichoke dip is almost always good but because of that, I think my standard of ""good"" artichoke is much higher than that of others. I think there is something here for everyone, young or old, adventurous or not.

Richard D.,"Tustin, CA",36,52,,4.0,8/15/2012,"I doubt that for most folks, CPK would qualify as comfort food but it is for me.  I've been a customer from its beginning in Los Angeles, when it was operating off the menu created by Ed LaDou (Wolfgang Puck's first pizza chef at the original Spago), and it still is a go-to for some of my favorites even though the chain has changed hands a couple of times.  CPK has a pretty disciplined training program so servers are generally skilled and attentive and you pretty much know what to expect in terms of atmosphere in that the restaurants all have a similar feel.  I've had favorite menu items come and go based on periodic menu changes, but the Sicilian and Thai Chicken pizzas always make me happy as does the original chopped salad (hold the scallions and the garbanzos, please).  The way the restaurants are set up, just about any size group can be accommodated and with the diverse and evolving menu choices, it's safe to say that there is something for everyone.  I always look forward to my next visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=280

N K.,"Cerritos, CA",0,95,,3.0,9/4/2010,"What has happened to CPK? They never had the best pizzas, pastas, or appetizers. But, at least their food was descent and delicious.  Today, I could only give their food a 2 star. The 3 stars was due to the attentive service.  Appetizers: Among the 7 or 8 appetizers, 3 of them were some kind of rolls which covered more than 1/3 of the appetizer choices. I thought the choices were pretty limited. I had the avocado rolls which were deep fried with some dry diced chicken, very salty bacon bits and tiny bit of avocado. My server recommended the lettuce wraps which again had some dry diced chicken with asian sauce, served with slices of lettuce. I did asked myself why didn't I go to a Chinese restaurant for this dish. Pasta: Jambalaya wasn't too bad, with enough ingredients(shrimp, sausage, ham, and crawfish) in it. Pizza: Hawaiian bbq chicken pizza tasted kinda weird. It's salty due to the bbq sauce but at the same time with a distinctive taste of sugar. The taste was off. The crust was not chewy or doughy. Even the whole pizza looked kinda sad, not appetizing at all.  Drinks: extremely disappointed with its new ""Cranberry Cooler"". For the first couple sip, I got chills down my spine due to its acidity.  Couple more sips, I found it tasteless. I was expecting this to be a refreshing drink, but it's almost like drinking slightly flavored water. Service: my server was efficient. The manager came to each table to socialize a bit. The atmosphere has always been pleasant. Very disappointed. Probably will not return any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=280

The management seems like a joke, (tell you what you want to hear to your face, then when they go back to fix it, talk shit to the nearest server or assistant manager) but my server made up for it. He was a really friendly guy, wasn't too attentive that was annoying, but frequently checked on me, and it didn't feel like a sequence of service, or a list or required duties for him to get the job done. Mike was his name, and from what I could tell, he was running the bar, bar/lounge, my table, part of the patio, and what appeared to be a take out service. I know, sounds like he would be forgetting my bread, or bringing out the wrong drink, but he was surprisingly very collected. I had the chicken ceaser sandwhich on herb onion foccia bread, with the tortilla soup. All was pleasantly presented, and tasted great. To end of my trip to the HB location, I finished with a red velvet cake with a scoop of ice cream. There is a god.
