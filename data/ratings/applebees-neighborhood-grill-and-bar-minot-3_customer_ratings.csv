14,Susan W.,"Minot, ND",7,44,1136.0,2.0,2012-06-01,"It's Applebee's so I don't expect much.  This Applebee's is the same as any other.  Just ok.  Super busy since there aren't many restaurants in town.   The Mozzarella Sticks were your standard sticks, over priced, frozen but good and there are about 8-10 per order.  The Blackened Chicken Penne Pasta was bland.  The chicken wasn't blackened, it seemed like a frozen pre grilled piece of chicken and the spinach wasn't even cooked.   The Husband had a Bacon Cheese Burger and said it was really good.   My son ordered Chicken Strips Kids Meal with Broccoli and it looked good, nothing special, your standard frozen strips but tasty.  The Broccoli was steamed nicely. I posted pics, check them out! Service was good, fast and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
21,Anna N.,"San Diego, CA",579,191,263.0,1.0,2012-07-05,"I have only been here a few times and normally it's okay but the last time I went on Monday, 5/28/2012, it was disgusting. Okay, service was good for Minot, the place is clean, and is quite busy. However the food this time was disgustingly salty that we couldn't eat it. The four of us did a 2 for $20 and shared our appetizers. The Queso Blanco was served with tortilla chips and the queso was tasty that we almost licked the plate clean, but the chips were horrendously salty! I wiped off the salt off of one chip and it COATED my small sharing plate. We complained and got a new batch, which had a lot of salt as well, but we thought not to complain anymore because we wouldn't want our food to be messed with and figured there wouldn't be a change since this basket of chips were bad as well. The boneless wings with the sweet and spicy sauce were good (not dry and had a good bite to it). Not my favorite sauce but that is a favorite of one of my friends. The blackened chicken penne was tasty. The noodles were served el dente with a light cream Alfredo with cooked spinach, diced tomato, Parmesan cheese, and slices of slightly tender blackened chicken breast. The bourbon street chicken and shrimp was another story. The shrimp was cooked well. They were tender and juicy with a good flavor. The chicken was cooked well but was coated with a bit too much salt but shaving off some of the crust helped. The potatoes had the same issue as the chips! I saw a layer of salt on my food and others who had any starch on it had the same issue. We were all thoroughly disgusted with how much salt there was in our meal after complaining once. We mentioned the amount of salt which shocked our waitress but we thought to be nice and not send the plates back.  Overall, the server was very sweet and the place is nice. This may be an isolated incident, but I think the next time I'll ever go here is if my friends force me to come here. I'd rather not die of diabetes eating here or have to scrape the salt of my food in order for it to be edible. Even the guy who literally adds salt to everything couldn't even the food and started scraping off the salt. Maybe if they rethink the amount of salt they add or teach the cook that day that with salt, sometimes less is more, then I'll consider coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3?start=20,,,,,
20,Kyla F.,"Minot, ND",2,14,,2.0,2012-11-05,"The past couple times ive gone too Applebee's its not been good at all. Waiting for our table the staff & mgmt were arguing in front of us.  We were seated in the very back, when it wasnt busy at all, and when we got to the back looked like all the staff were on their lunch breaks just hanging out. Our server was very rude. All the tables were dirty and the floor not vaccuumed. We were the only ones seated back there(??) Also, the manager there that wears glasses (michael maybe) is one of the rudest people ive ever come into contact with. Hes rude to his staff in front of guests, and rude to the guests. Wont be going back for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3?start=20,,,,,
15,Vincent B.,"Minot, ND",6,34,3.0,2.0,2013-08-09,"Most Applebee's would rate as average (around 3 stars, 4 if they have a good wait staff); the food being the same across the country (mostly frozen, premade stuff). This one is over crowded with a staff that doesn't care and the food quality is unpredictable ranging from average to bad.  Mostly what you find here are oil workers and out of towners who just want a place to get drunk and don't care about the food quality, so neither does the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
13,Tiana T.,"Pinconning, MI",65,62,67.0,2.0,2013-08-28,I'm grading this based on the fact that its a chain and I'm comparing this to other Applebee's. Most chain restaurants rarely fare more than 3 stars. The only time they deserve four is when their pre-made food is executed perfectly and service is exceptional.  This outpost is neither of those. The place was rather crowded even for a Wednesday evening. I'm assuming the Comfort Inn next door plays a key role in that. I attended with a few friends that have been in Minot for a while. The first thing you notice is that the place is easily 10° colder than outside. My female friend admitted that the place is always cold and she regretted not wearing sleeves. In their last trip she went so far as to order hot cocoa. The food was sub-par. We waited a little over 20 mins for our food. 2/3 entrees ordered had issues. My steak was ordered mid but came out well. I also got to bite into a large chunk of garlic in my potatoes. My friends meal was missing a side.  Service wasn't any better. The waitress wasn't pleasant. Out food runner slammed the plates. Except for mine. She handed it to me when it was still clearly hot enough for her to need a towel.  Will I go back? Probably. Will I be excited? No.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
17,M S.,"Sulphur Springs, TX",0,8,5.0,3.0,2014-06-10,Read it first  I'm really not a fan of this chain but tonight was good . They had a 3 sampler for about 14 bucks Not bad  Service was good and portions were ok I count on the reviews because of my travels. So when in Minot it's a least a safe bet,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
19,Amy E.,"Minot, ND",11,8,,2.0,2014-07-18,"We go in often, and it's the same as always. All employees act like your inconveniencing them. Managers too! The food is typical frozen, thrown in the microwave type dishes. But it's to be expected. I always have to order my pasta with extra Alfredo sauce due to it severely lacking on my plate... oh and they charge for that too ""just a heads up"" We continue to go there until I can find another place to get good Alfredo sauce. So when you go, don't expect the wait staff to appreciate your visit, no matter how much you tip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
22,Cristy C.,"Belgrade, MT",0,6,,1.0,2014-09-16,Went for lunch I'm in my forties and have a temp I'd and was refused to be served alcohol I think the real reason is they hate out of state customers my id has worked fine for months,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3?start=20,,,,,
9,Brain P.,"Minot, ND",2,51,9.0,4.0,2014-12-21,"This is a great place. Not sure why all the haters they must just be those ""elite foodies"" but my food has always been good. The staff has always been accommodating and friendly.  The posts about out of towners and oil workers is your typical tash talk of people that don't want change.  If you want taste and decent food at a good price then this will work. If you are a hipster and don't like change then please go else where or even stay home and cook organic.  I'll be back to chow down. One other great feature the curb side to go. Check it out.  Boom!!

16,Bianca O.,"Minot, ND",44,52,,4.0,2015-02-26,"I like the new pub grains dishes. I gained a lot of weight from restaurant food over the past couple years so having Applebee's healthen up some of the dinner dishes was a nice thing to see.

One of the two entrees ordered is missing a side as well. Won't go back and wish I could take my tip away from the car side to go server. I wanna add that after I left my Car side to go spot, just around the corner three employees were sitting outside smoking....smoke break at 5:15 pm mind ya!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
18,Michelle H.,"Minot, ND",0,21,,1.0,2015-06-05,"Came here for lunch and had a question about the size of the martini I had asked for. The server came back to our table with a attitude and said the drinks were ""pre measured"" and set the drink down and asked with sass if I still wanted it....brought it to the managers attention and she seemed as if she could careless about the issue. Will not be coming back l have worked in the service industry in the past in Orlando, Florida and know what it means to give customer service to your tables. Listen to the previous reviews and save your money. This establishment obviously doesn't welcome those who are not from town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,

8,A C.,"Regina, Canada",2,8,,4.0,2015-11-01,"In town for a very quick stay, and flying out in the middle of the night. After a very long and stressful travel day, decided Applebee's was a great (or one of the closest) option.  Walked in to find the place half full. The 3 hostesses at the front were absolutely miserable. Requested a booth, and were told to wait. If we took a table, we could sit right away.  We took the table and were seated right across from a few empty booths.  Overall, the food was good, came out hot and in good time. Server was great, once she came over to our table. Miscommunication with the hostesses we were told. Not her fault.  I rated 4 stars due to the miserable greeting at the front door. Food quality was wonderful, but then again maybe I was just starving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
11,Heather D.,"Garden Grove, CA",25,10,1.0,4.0,2015-11-29,What happened Applebee's???! The Applebee's I've gone to in California had much bigger portions and didn't go light on any of the sauces. This Applebee's doesn't compare to those ones back home. Other than that the people were kind and our waitress was amazing. The food was pretty hot and it still tastes pretty good but it was all just sorta dry and small. I got the Mac and cheese and they sure went light on there bacon and sauce. My boyfriend got the steak which was pretty small compared to the other Applebee's. At least we got a few refills on our drinks though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
5,Sarah B.,"Mesa, AZ",2,171,10.0,4.0,2016-01-19,"Oooh !  crabby apples here, such bad reviews.  I will add mine because I had a really good time and the food was great.  Went to have dinner with a friend and it was a super busy Monday night, all the Minotians out having a good old time.  Very friendly and busy with families and all kinds of groups.  Lots of socializing among people who seemed to know each other - go figure, small town ! Anyway, my meal was excellent - the quesedilla burger and fries - and my friend's steak looked very good.  I have never had anything other than really good service and food at Applebees, here or anywhere else in the country.   So, thanks for the good food, good atmosphere and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
3,Theresa J.,"Oceanside, CA",25,45,2.0,2.0,2016-06-10,"The place seem to be very busy, and the server when we walked in didn't have a smile or a greeting nothing.. people there seem kinda rude. The waitress was in a hurry and rushed us to order. And wasn't around after the food got to our table. The people there that was eating there were giving us dirty looks due because we have children with us . And the kids were quiet the whole time.  The only thing good was the food. Other then that nothing else was. People need to learn customer service and the people in the town need to learn how to smile and get there noses out of the air and stop being rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,

6,Lori F.,"Velva, ND",1,5,,1.0,2016-09-30,"If I have to give them a rating one star is about it. I would advise you not to get the drive through. The girl who came out was nice. But the food is horrible.  We like our steaks medium-well to well done closer to well. That is how we order it every time. The steaks were medium at best. You would almost think that this was done on purpose. As we order 3 different steak meals. 1st steak was a 12 oz that was a little on the fatty side and was medium well not closer to the well we asked for. The 2nd steak was medium at best and had to be ""re-fired"" when it got here. It came with rice that tasted like it had a half a bottle of oregano dumped on it and grilled vegetables that came whole not cut the squash and zucchini came cut in half instead of cut. The squash looked disgustingly gross laying there. So veggies had to be cut up into pieces.  3rd steak about the same a bit more fat running through it and the fries that came with the other 2 steak were good and the Mac and cheese.  I won't be coming here again soon. To pay 60 bucks for this kind of food was not worth it.  Over all will not come here again unless I can go inside.  No more car side serves for us they screw you and give you the fattest meat. They must not have very good kitchen staff is all I can come up with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
2,Maritza G.,"McAllen, TX",0,11,23.0,5.0,2016-10-01,"Ordered: 1. SV Beef Nachos Appetizer 2. Lunch combo: clubhouse grille & 4 cheese Mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken 3. Brew Pub Philly 4. Side house salad 5. Berry refresher drink  The nachos were amazing and I'm from south Texas. Very good food. I was very impressed by their new menu and will definitely be returning. Service/staff were very tentative and friendly.  The clubhouse grille had all sorts of awesome flavors like a sweet, smokehouse, salty flavor.  The dill cucumbers on the side had like 6 different flavors in it: sweet salty and then wait a little longer and you get a spicy kick.  Garlic Parmesan fries were awesome. They had a lot of different foods and choices: Asian, Mexican, American - hearty food.  Didn't try their steaks but they're not a steakhouse so I wasn't sure about ordering that.  5 stars all the way. Good job Applebee's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
4,Eddy R.,"Sabin, MN",0,1,,1.0,2017-02-14,Writing this as I am waiting in a carside to go line. Yup a f'n line. I didn't create the traffic pattern. Just following along.  This is the most BS way they could have done this system.  Been in line for 15 min. Order was ready 20 min ago. Still 10 min away from the car hop.  I am unable to move in any direction. Angry customers blocked in trying to leave.

0,Julia J.,"Minot Air Force Base, ND",0,8,4.0,4.0,2017-11-28,"I was hesitant to try this Applebee's since I have had bad experiences at other locations, I'm glad I did though because this is great ""fast casual"". The menu changes often and the 2 for $20 or $25 makes it a favorite for a dinner and a movie date without a large price tag. The burgers are a bit dry and bland compared to JL Beers, but the mac and cheese and butcher's meat + potatoes are both winners. As people who usually share a dessert the Triple Chocolate Meltdown is delicious as the perfect size for two! My husband loved the Fireball lemonade but cocktail menu is a little too fruity for me. The service has always been friendly and as fast as can be expected on a busy Friday or Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,,,,,
1,Evan K.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,21,5.0,1.0,2017-12-10,I haven't been to this Applebee's location in the past year where they haven't messed up. It's so rare that they don't make a mistake on your meal. Car-side to go is the ultimate rip off. They will give you half the food then screw up your bill so it's more expensive and then expect you to tip them? Don't even bother trying to bring it up to the manager either. He's the biggest idiot there. Has been there for years (somehow) but he does nothing to fix your order and half the time he is the one who screws you at the car-side to go. I would recommend going to wings and rings or Buffalo Wild Wings instead. Sad because I love Applebee's but the employees and management at the Minot location make it not worth the hassle.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-minot-3,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
