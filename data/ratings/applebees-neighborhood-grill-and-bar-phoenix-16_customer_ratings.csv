70,Darlene P.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,120,411.0,2.0,2012-09-29,"Not going to beat around the bush here, the biggest problem with this place is the food.  We thought it was AWFUL.  Not good, not okay, but AWFUL.  This was our first and last time there.  We took a few bites and left. My husband's burger tasted off, like ground beef was past its freshness date.  My riblet basket was worse.  The dish had 2 unrecognizable ""riblets"".  They were these 1/4 inch thick, flattened things...at first glance they looked like rehydrated mini sheets of beef jerky.  When you broke them apart, they seemed like real meat with flat bones, but then you taste it and it tastes like those gross artificial, frozen pork products you find in bad cafeterias or cheap buffets.  The kicker was my son's kids meal.  He ordered cheese pizza.  What arrived was a tortilla with cheap-tasting red sauce and  cheese.  A tortilla!!!   Now he's 5 yrs old and was hungry, so he actually ate a few bites, but I cringed as I watched him eat it, and vowed to never come back.  I don't know how this place stays in business.  I can only imagine they make most of their profits from liquor/beer sales.  The only decent things we ordered were my other son's chicken tenders and milkshakes for both kids.  Luckily, those are hard to screw up. Other things to note:  After ordering, we noticed that every so often an unpleasant odor, like a sewer/dirty-bathroom smell, would waft by, though we were nowhere near the bathroom.  Also, the server, while nice and attentive, seemed to know the food was awful....we sensed it in her body language, that she knew why we were in a hurry to leave and leaving uneaten food on our plates.  The nice server was the only reason this place gets 2 stars rather than 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16?start=60,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

Nothing super special but the Bees is a good solid choice for food or drinks when you don't feel like thinking about where to go.  They recently got Kilt lifter in which is a bonus! Honestly its a solid place for those trying this budget thing out.  There are many specials and the food is always decent enough.  Service is friendly, but at times can be sketchy.  But since they are rotating servers all the time, I can't hold that too much against them.

64,Morris K.,"Phoenix, AZ",1172,85,,4.0,2013-05-13,"My wife and I come here for the Unlimited Soup and Salad. My wife always gets the Santa Fe Salad and usually the Broccoli soup. If it isn't the soup of the day then she will get the French Onion Soup. On occasion she goes for the Corn Chowder Soup. Her only complaint is they serve Pepsi products instead of Coke.   For me I always get the Oriental Chicken Salad with either the French Onion Soup, or the Corn Chowder. If you have never been to a Applebee's for their Unlimited Soup and Salad  you should give it a try.  This particular location is clean as one would hope and the staff is attentive as expected. It is a nice place to grab a quick bite in the neighborhood CUSTOMER SERVICE: The wait service is always friendly and quick.  FOOD: The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but it is pretty good and reasonable priced and always a  good value. AMBIENCE: Fun with a very comfortable feel but sometimes it trends a little loud but not so much that it still wouldn't be a good place for dates and casual conversation.

66,Leanna A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",7,142,106.0,3.0,2014-05-30,"I was considerably impressed with this Applebee's, especially taking into play the fact that I usually can't stand any Applebee's.  Came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. The place is considerably small, but we were seated immediately. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Salad and he got the appetizer trio or something like that with buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks and pretzel sticks w/ beer cheese. It came out in a reasonable amount of time. Being on their under 500 calories menu, I figures that the Thai shrimp salad was going to be sub-par, however it came out with 14 (I counted) well-seasoned, perfectly cooked and de-veined mini shrimp on top, which in my opinion is a really good deal for $10.99. The dressing was good, and was a nice mixture of spicy and sweet. I felt that they put a little too many pieces of shredded carrots and edamame pieces in it compared to the lettuce, but it wasn't a big deal. My only complaint would be that some of the lettuce wasn't as fresh as it could be and there were a couple of wilted pieces. Overall bill came out to be around $32 which is a tad high in my opinion for an Applebee's but whatever. I can't complain.  The service is plainly average. Our server was there when she was supposed to be, but there wasn't anything fantastic or above average about her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16?start=60,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

The nice commercial about the take two entres is very misleading. The nice juicy steak in the commercial is just a steak nugget, barely bigger than my thumb!  For that price you also get a wedge of iceberg lettuce which amounts to 1/8 of a small head of lettuce. Strangely the ""meal"" is delicious but what exactly on the plate was worth $10.99?? By the way, if you want a real second entre, the price is $11.99. Was the excess charge for the skillful way the cook kept the nugget from falling through the grill? Maybe it was for the extra char on the nugget? Or maybe the 4 leaves of raw spinach under the nugget?

There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy.

Your lunch will either be $7-$9 depending on what combination of items you pick. I think I nailed it with my selection of the chicken cheese penne bake and the chipotle chicken wrap. They are lunch portion sized, but it filled me up quite nicely. The pasta had nice strips of white chicken grilled on top and wasn't overly cheesy while the wrap had enough flavor on its own, but was helped by an orange dipping sauce (chipotle).

Instead the waitress gave us the bill for the food. Thankfully  minus the charge for person #2 burger.  How ever I still feel slighted or over looked because the manager never made an attempt to check on us or speak to us. The waitress apologized numerous times but her apologies didn't make the food come out any quicker, or stop the missing items.

I was violently ill for about 48 hrs.  Needless to say, every time I heard the name, I would think of the Asian chicken salad I had ordered, and how something didn't seem right with it.  Then, I think of the pain I was in, and the violent vomiting and bowel movements I had for 2 days. Again, it goes without saying, that I avoided Applebees for a very long time. My ex finally convinced me to try it again, as their menu had changed a lot, and had some new items on it. So I gave it a try. WOW.  I ordered the all day brunch burger.  Did I say wow?  That burger was the most flavorful, juiciest burer I have had in a long long time.  The hashbrowns on it, with the fried egg....YUM!  It comes with ketchup...but no one in their right mind puts ketchup on a burger.  Gross.

My grandparents are in town and this is one of their favorites back home so we decided to stop in tonight. We were seated fast and the waiter came taking our drink orders right away.. He came back about 2 minutes later with our drinks..we were not ready to order a yet (group of 6) so he said he would come back soon and check with us again..it took him 15 minutes to come back and take our order..lucky my kids were playing with the tablet they had on the table and lost track of time.. He came and took our order and to my surprise he didn't write down one thing anyone said .. He just kept saying ""yes sir"" ""ok"" so at that moment I was a little worried if he was going to get everyone's order in correctly. We waited another 30 minutes for an order of Spanish dip and mozzarella sticks..which he never brought us any plates for. 25 minutes later half of us received our main dish. My grandfather ordered baked potato and was given fries.. He let him keep them and went and got him a potato. He said the kids meals and my husbands chicken and shrimp were coming.. We ask for another round of drinks.. He said he would be right back.. Another women came out with my husbands meal but didn't know about the kids orders.. We waited another 20 minutes for my kids food and our drinks to come. Everybody else was almost done with their food..They had chicken tenders and fries and a cheese pizza and fries. Of course it took another 15 minutes to flag him down for our check.. 75$ check I only left a 8$ tip.. Trust me I didn't want to leave that. But I will say the food we received was good.. We all did enjoy our food...just wish we could of enjoyed it together. This experience was a real big disappointment for my family.. We just wanted a nice evening with our grandparents and it turned in to a frustrating long night.

There were only a few other guests there, mostly sitting at the bar. We were sat quickly and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back quickly to take our meal orders. My husband got the Standard Burger, the waitress asked him ""Pink or No Pink"" to which my husband responded ""No Pink"" and even followed up with ""Well Done"". Personally, I would think that meant he wanted the burger cooked all the way through. We got our food out and my husband cuts his burger in half... Low and behold the burger is pink throughout.  We call the waitress over to the table, show her the burger and remind her that he asked for well done. She responds with, ""it's only a little pink, but I can put it back on the grill."" My husband verifies that she plans on putting a but in half burger back on the grill, with all of the sauce and cheese already on it...  She then says, ""oh, you want a new one... Okay.""  Meanwhile, my brother and I have our food and are done eating. The manager brings his new burger out to us and explains that we will not be charged for the burger, we ask for it to go and the manager has an attitude about it and walks away while my husband is APOLOGIZING to him for the extra task! (If the food was cooked the correct way in the first place this would have been a non-issue) We then get the food to go and tip the waitress (for what I am not sure) and are walking out, all the while the manager is glaring at us from the bar.

As we first walked into this place the smell was not so good. I could not recall the smell but it was not that of a restaurant.  We get our seat and look at the menu.  The waitress takes our order, and then goes on to explain we chose great meals. She wishes she could afford what we ordered. She also gave us a sense that she did not like her job. So I assume the pay at Applebee's is subpar, or her productivity is of the same level. As she walked away she looked to the hostess and said I need to smoke lets go. I'm sure the management does not have a clue of how bad you truly are.  I ordered a medium steak, to my surprise I get a rare steak. My wife orders a medium well steak and gets a medium. This lets me know the chef has no idea what he is doing in the back and the training program is below par. I would have sent it back but this place looked to like one of them that you would get more than you asked for.  As we go to pay, which now is a machine because the waitresses are so busy talking crap about everyone to take my payment. Anyway, they tried to charge me double on my drinks. The waitress went back to the manager 3 times before they finally took my credit card and manually ran it with the proper bill.  I am completely unimpressed with this Applebee's. I also assume that this chain has fallen off the caring list. There is a lot of work that needs to be done.

It appeared that our waitress was covering half of the tables by herself while the other 4 waitresses we saw shared the other half. This on top of having more than 1 table that didn't speak english, making it harder for her to take the orders, could have been alleviated with a better distribution of waitresses. It took us far to long to be served (not our waitresses fault) than it should have. Finding out that there were things on the menu that were no longer being sold was kind of a bummer but not the end of the world. We ordered an appetizer and the kitchen forgot to make it. My wife's salad looked like it had been sitting out waiting to be served since the morning and was missing a few of the normal components. My meal was fine but seemed to have been tossed together compared to usual. It seems like service and quality have gone down hill very quickly at this location and it should be addressed immediately.

I only gave it a star because it require me to rate it but I feel it deserves a half stare. After eating here I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  It started with a phone call. They said there was no wait. That should have been my first clue, for a Friday night rush. When we get there 3 mins later there is actually a 15 minuet wait. You cannot tell me that in 3 mins 4-5 tables came in all of a sudden.  Then came the ordering. The waitress messed up my drinks, also had to ask for water 3 times before I got some. We ordered appetizers when we ordered drinks.   Appetizers took an hour to get and 1:3 were cold and only a partial portion 3 tacos and not 4.  At that point my table asked for a manager. The manager said it was a coaching experience for the waitress. Did not apologize and blames the computer for the issue. And rudely said (eye role heard in her voice about the partial appetizer comment) ""let me go get that last taco for you.""  When our food was arriving the waitress said the potato would take about her 5 min. The person who got the potato said ""I don't want a potato microwaved"". I agree with her statement. If you go out you should not be getting a potato microwaved.   The steak was hard as a brick and the grilled veggies were solid half slabs not sliced and they were raw in the middle.  The waitress said there would be 4 grilled veggies and the woman only got two labs of squash and 3 red pepper slices.  So the ""manager"" said ""I'll go back and get you another side"" in the most Obnoxious tone I've ever heard. I have no idea how she can be a manager. I feel like our waitress was more a manager than the actual manager even though she was slow.  As soon as she realized our irritation  she became more attentive.  In the end we got one meal taken off which is the least they could do.  I will never be back to this one. I know a better one in central phx I will be glade to drive an extra 30 mins to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

3,Michelle B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",129,7,,1.0,2017-10-21,I'll give this one star because I have to but honestly they deserve not even half a star. My boyfriend and I just sat in this restaurant for almost 25minutes and didn't even have waters yet or have an order taken. Took10 minutes for someone to even greet us and I was amazed considering how many employees were standing around (including managers) and not one was providing any help or appearing to be a team atmosphere. Especially considering there was maybe 3 tables in there and over 7 staff members standing around talking. Coming from someone in this industry I can say that I am beyond disappointed with how poor this place is ran. 90% of a restaurants reputation is the service provided and in 25minutes I can say the lack of service speaks for itself. Step it up and look into new staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

7,Kim P.,"Phoenix, AZ",41,26,,1.0,2017-10-28,"We went here last night for dinner, and I have to say our waitress was horrific! She did not check on us once, had a very nasty personality and was very rude and snippy to our entire group of 5 and a infant. As we watched all the other servers make rounds and smile and be kind, our waitress had a stone face and her personality sucked! in fact, she did not even tell us her name. I personally had a burger, and  the bun was very burnt and hard. my daughter did not like her meal at all, it was tasteless and bland. We waited 20 minutes to ask about our bill and a box for take home for the dogs. Today, I wake up throwing up with severe stomach pain. Horrible food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
9,Chris B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,1.0,2017-11-18,Went there and was seated immediately. Waited 15 mins for the waitress to come just to take out drink order. The place was empty. Maybe 8 customers between two waitress. Food came out and part of it was cold. Would not go to this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-16,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
