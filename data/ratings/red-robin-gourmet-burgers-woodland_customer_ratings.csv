I am allergic to peppers i noticed the blue burger had sauce that I could not have and so told the waitress I could not eat that and I was allergic and would swell up to it. Did she tell the cooks in the back? Not a clue but when I bit into the burger I knew the sauce I ask for it not to be there was. I could not believe how my mouth burned and then my arms started to go red. there are people out there with allergies thank god I had some of my pills in me from this morning but I had to run home to take some more. RUDE YES, AS ALL HELL! as for my big birthday burger what a waste. she knew what she had done wrong because she kept saying sorry as we wanted to leave but she took forever to bring us any thing aka ranch for our fries, the check to get the hell out of there! our change to get the hell out of there!

I ordered the Turkey Burger, and it was SO good! I never know how tasty and delicious a turkey burger could be. I loved that it was a healthier option than a regular hamburger too.  And bottomless fries? YES please! They also have some great dipping sauce choices, but I just stuck to my usual favorite, ranch.  The food was great, but the service was not.

Great job by the cooks.  When we walked in we were greeted by a server. She took us to our seat. It hadn't been wiped down so my girlfriend asked that it be wiped down. The greeter who sat us went to the kitchen area and grabbed some napkins. Get this! Instead of wiping it down she handed the napkins to my girlfriend. What?? Seriously?  Our waitress was friendly and pleasant. I had to ask for a lemonade refill after my glass sat empty for about 10 minutes. Other than those two things our visit here was worth repeating.

Their ""gourmet"" burgers are quite alright and nothing to rave about especially at the prices they are set at.  It's not a disappointing meal as the OK burgers are balanced by the gimmicks of the fries/drinks. I haven't seen this location super packed like other locations, but that may be the result of having a restaurant in woodland.  The service is on par with other sit downs and the waiters will come around and ask if you want more fries, etc... instead of you asking them.

I have tried to really hard to give this place numerous chances to at least earn my loyalty.  I am not asking for the French Laundry here, I want service to be relatively prompt and accurate.  They rarely get orders correct, forget key components of take out orders and there have been several times that I and my companions have fell oddly ill after ordering innocent items such as salads.

93,Sheena T.,"Silicon Valley, CA",289,450,138.0,4.0,2012-11-14,"Love, love, love Red Robin. I've been here about 8 times, and its never failed me. I've always ordered the bottomless freckled strawberry lemonade (and occasionally, if I've been good with my diet and exercise regime, a root beer float) and as for the appetizers, sometimes the towering onion rings or the trio with the sweet potato fries. The onion rings, have always, without fail, been crispy and fried to perfection. As for the entrees, I usually alternate between a classic chicken sandwich, a southwest chicken pasta, or clucks and fries - all of which are plenty delish and delectable. The chicken sandwich puts McDonald's chicken sandwich to shame. I hate myself for even putting Red Robin's chicken sandwich in the same sentence as Mickey D's! I'm sorry, Red Robin. The service here has been always pretty consistent, attentive, and friendly with not too much of a wait time during the times I go, and its convenient they open until 11 or 12. It takes about 10-15 minutes maximum for the food to come out if the restaurant is fairly occupied, which is perfectly fine with me. Their bottomless fries and drinks have always been a favorite, and kept me coming back! There's a ""Royalty Card"" here now, and I believe if you register it and have ten meals on it, you get one meal free.

164,Jeff R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",47,134,59.0,2.0,2013-07-10,"I generally enjoy Red Robin and stopped into this location for the first time in almost 2 years.  I was trying to grab a quick burger for a late lunch and get on my way back to work.  It was late afternoon so the restaurant was almost completely empty; I decided to sit at the bar for what I hoped would be fast service since time was short.  I was greeted quickly by the bartender and offered a drink; I ordered a beverage and since I'm familiar with the menu immediately placed my food order.  I sipped on my drink as I watched the baseball game on the TV while being completely ignored by the bartender who was in the middle of re-organizing the bar and doing some cleaning and maintenance.  After about 10 minutes I looked over towards the kitchen and saw the cook place my burger on the counter, fully expecting the bartender to go grab my meal I waited patiently.  Another 5 minutes passed and 2 other customers came in and they were greeted and offered drinks which were served as I continued to wait for someone to bring my food out to me.  Finally the bartender walked out from behind the bar and headed towards the kitchen; unfortunately she didn't even go to the counter and get my food, instead briefly chatted with another server and then came back with some items she had grabbed from the server station.  She inquired with the other customers if they were ready to order and they both placed their food orders.  Bartender went back to tasking and another 5 minutes passed before she realized that maybe my food was ready.  She went over to the counter and grabbed my meal which had now been sitting under heat lamps for over 10 minutes.  The burgers are generally halfway decent and the bottomless fries are a bonus but my meal was lukewarm and I had only about 12 fries in my basket.  In a hurry I ate my meal and finished my drink before I was done; as I took my last bite I was asked if I wanted another beverage.  I politely declined and didn't dare ask for more fries as I didn't have 15-20 minutes to wait for what would have amounted to 10 more fries.  Considering how slow the place was I found this service to be a joke. Red Robin has great happy hour specials, a nice selection of appetizers, burgers, and other menu items so you can count on a pretty good meal.  Service was a big problem on this visit but I may be willing to give them another chance if I was eating in this area again.  If the service is the same as it was on this visit; I will never return!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=160,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.6000000000000005,3.1200000000000006

It sounds weird but it was surprisingly delicious. Tip: Sign up for their Royalty Club.

I like the burgers, they are pretty tasty, although they typically don't resemble the pictures very much.  The one thing that drives me nuts about this place is the sweet potato fries. They always come out cold. Always. Last time I asked the waitress for hot sweet potato fries, and explained to her that I always seem to get cold fries. She brought me cold fries again. I realize that they are probably a lower volume item than the normal fries, but that's not really a reason to not make them fresh...  Also, bring a jacket.

Meat was cooked to about medium and fries were all hot.  SERVICE: Service was fine, we came earlier during lunch, so we didn't have to wait to get a seat, to order, or to pay. VALUE: Given the fries are endless, this would be a great value for stuffing your stomach. Even without the free burger in mind, this place is ok if you like variety in your burgers. If you're not into fries, then it could be somewhat expensive for the size of burgers you get.

My roommate can only do turkey/chicken burgers, so I wasn't too sure (she recommended it), but it's to die for! - What needs to change (safety wise): Okay I never thought about suing a place kind of thing, but I realized sometimes it's a good thing if it changes something, to raise awareness, and to be taken seriously.. I went on Friday night, it was rainy day. This poor older middle-aged - older man fell flat on his face because the mat wasn't placed where it should have been (and it was soaked), so the floor was slippery (he was leaving) and he fell not because he was clumsy because he didn't walk fast or anything.. Literally, I think he should sue because they didn't do much to change that condition when he left. My roomie's friend is pre-med and he thankfully was there to see if the man was okay or not. He could repeat numbers, but not have them backwards..  One of the workers just told him to sit down and to have water repeatedly (I felt like it wasn't genuine but an avoidance to get into trouble), but honestly didn't even mention of doing report, another worker did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.444,2.76

When I arrived I was directed to complete my transaction at the bar. Tiffany, the bar tender, takes my money and goes to retrieve my order. As she walks away I realized I forgot to ask for ranch with my California Chicken Burger. I followed her to the kitchen and waited at the glass to get her attention. As I waited and watched patiently, little did I know, I would soon say the words ""I will never eat here again!""  Tiffany calls to get the cook's attention and he hands her to go bags. She quickly and flawlessly opens the box. She then picks up the burger in foil to examine it. Unsure of the burger, she opens the foil to look at the meat. Still unsure, she takes the burger completely out of the foil and holds the burger directly in her bare hands!!! Tiffany's UNWASHED STICKY BAR AND CASH HANDLING FINGERS ARE ON THE BUNS OF MY BURGER!!!!!  I talked to manager, David,to inform him of what I saw. David was unmoved by my story. David simply recited a script he was to memorize and regurgitate to customers that have witness unsanitary acts. He let me know that they have a hand washing policy but does not explain what that exactly meant. David didn't think it was odd that she didn't wash her hands before she touched all of my food. David also didn't say that ""she should have"" washed her hands before handling my food. They probably do that all the time.  Definitely got my refund.

My dad and I wanted to share the garlic fries, and when we finally got them, there was barely any in the basket-not even a dozen of them. They sucked anyways.  Also, another waitress appeared who helped just one table in the bar area, she spent the whole time flirting with the guys there instead of helping any of the other tables. Oh, also! The bartender messed up the order of the couple by us! She was very rude and confrontational about, saying there was a ""miscommunication"", when they had to send back food and didn't get things they ordered.  I think the bartenders name is Paige, it's the only name on the receipt. She is an outright incompetent bitch and should not be working with the public.

We all asked for medium, but all three burgers came out very well done. I would actually characterize them as crunchy. I only ate half of my burger before giving up. I wasn't going to say anything to the server, but she looked at my plate and asked if everything was okay. The manager-in-training, Josiah, ended up coming over, and I'm not sure why he is ""in training,"" because he did EXACTLY what a manager should do.  He was very apologetic, and since I didn't want anything taken off my bill, he gave my family a gift card that we could use in the future.

76,Ashley C.,"Sacramento, CA",58,89,156.0,4.0,2015-10-12,"I have lived in Sacramento practically my entire life and had never stopped in Woodland, CA prior to this week and oddly enough those circumstances both landed me at this red robin with different people sharing the experience with me. The second visit was a better experience but the first wasn't horrible by any means. The first visit was on a Saturday at just about noon and the place seemed packed when we got there but my in-laws were able to get us a booth quickly. We were seated within probably two minutes and that was just because they had to clean our table. We were starving since we had been outside at football games all morning. Our server was very nice and was prompt at filling our drinks which was very nice since we were so thirsty after being out in the sun. The have amazing Dr. Pepper if you are a fan. We ordered quickly but seemed to wait a long time for our food. After about 30 min the 3 of us got our food. I ordered the river whiskey chicken sandwich on a gluten free bun as I always do and when I picked it up the bottom bun was hard. I know that gluten free items are often dry so don't get me wrong when I say I was shocked that I could tap it with my nail and it literally made a clinking sound which made us all chuckle. I flagged down someone and they got us our server. He was very apologetic and offered to take it back and have it remade and I told him it wasn't a big deal and if he could just get me another bottom bun I would be fine, no sense in remaking it. It took over 5 min to get a new bun. It was warm and toasted but they didn't bring me any of the condiments that originally came on my bun and since the gluten free bun runs dry it is necessary. Since it had already taken so long and my in laws were nearly done eating I opted to just take the rest of my mother in laws blue cheese sauce that came with hers. It was really good but wasn't exactly the best flavor combo for my sandwich. My mother in law had the mushroom blucheese burger on a roll and my father in law had a mushroom Swiss burger. They loved theirs and said they were juicy and flavorful. Second visit: My husband has been away for work for nearly a month now and asked me to meet him here with our little guy for an early dinner so we could all spend time together since he had the afternoon off. This trip was much better! Our server was again very nice and friendly. I ordered the same things and this time it was probably the best one I have had to date. The bun was soft and the chicken was incredibly juicy! Our son had the pepperoni pizza and mandarin oranges which he loved and my husband ordered a fried seafood platter which he seemed pleased with. It did take a whole for our food to come out even though they were pretty empty inside. Since we were spending time with my husband and trying to just take our time and enjoy each other's company before we had to split ways we decided to order desserts. My son and I started a monster size Nana Nana moo moo milk shake which was banana and chocolate. I wasn't a fan of it since I grew up on  banana, chocolate and peanut butter milo shakes with malt made from my papa I have pretty high standards, however big shocker our 7 year old had no problem drinking his half and then topping off mine.

108,Melissa K.,"Woodland, CA",0,38,,3.0,2015-11-29,"Sort of ok for a chain restaurant. Had a great waiter ! He gave good service, unfortunately it is the corporate set up that failed. They require that food servers bring the food and deal with the kitchen, not your waiter. They do not care if you get the food cold or the wrong food as the waiter still has to give them a percentage of the bill. If you give the waiter a small tip or no tip, he still has to give a percentage of the total bill to the helper staff. Our waiter was great and attentive, unfortunately since he couldn't bring the food, the fries were stone cold, and two orders were wrong. The Whiskey River salad was served, but really was the regular chicken salad, no bbq or special veggies. When asked the delivery person brought a side a bbq sauce and said, just put that on! It took five minutes to replace the order of ""bottomless"" fries with some that were at least warm. Of course when we wanted more (we did pay extra for bottomless) they didn't arrive until we were done and paying. The chicken sandwich that was being promoted in their advertising stressed Arugula on it, but came with nothing. We were told the kitchen was out and could be replace by salad mix. We still tipped our waiter appropriately as not his fault, but not really happy with other service or food. We live one mile away, but will not be returning soon. This does not happen at the other burger place in town. Will definitely keep our business there. Update: four of the five people in our party got sick for the next 24 hours.

Both times we visited, we were seated at the exact same table: right next to the kitchen in a high traffic walkway, and backed right up to another table that is so close that when people are seated at both tables it leaves approximately 8"" of space to walk through. We have a baby who uses a high chair and because of the booth style seating on one side of our table, the only spot to put the high chair was directly in the walkway. Servers had to squeeze through with trays of food and drinks hovered over our heads, and it didn't happen just once or twice, it was constant.

They provide salad as one of the free substitutions for fries. I totally get trying to expand the margin; but, geez!

This is unacceptable, and they should be able to get them out a little faster. It's fries after all! If McDonalds can whip out new ones in 8-10, a Gourmet restaurant should be able to. SOMETIMES the employees get a little lazy and don't bring out the food quick enough. It's warm and under the heat lamp. This is the managers fault for not properly training the employees, not the employees fault. This definitely could be fixed. I think the ""excuse"" was that the fries were too hot.

0,Nicos B.,"Davis, CA",79,69,40.0,4.0,2017-12-11,"We stopped by for lunch because we wanted bottomless fries and their whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap. The wrap was fresh-tasting and good. The fries were hot and warm and we got a couple more baskets to eat. I think they purposely make the fries a little bland so that you season then yourself; they taste better with the seasoning on the table.  The service was okay. She wasn't the greatest, but also not the worst. Just almost average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland,3.12,2.92,2.92,,3.0000000000000004
5,Rachelle S.,"Sacramento, CA",105,44,5.0,5.0,2017-12-18,"I'm basing my review on online orders only as that's all I've ever done there. But they are absolutely wonderful with online to-go orders if you need a quick pick up and good food for your office lunch whether it's just you or you and your co-workers.  My orders have always been on time and ready to go. It's super easy to order online and then when I go in, I just state I ordered online and they do my official ring up (that I've pre-paid and am picking up), gather my food and send me on my way. They even send you off with a to-go cup of fries. The woman who has checked me out both times is super friendly and makes sure she tells me my order and points everything out and sends me off with all that I need. I definitely recommend online to-go orders! They are quick and convenient with good food that'll hit the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland,3.24,2.95,2.95,,3.0660000000000007
4,Alisha M.,"Sacramento, CA",26,36,16.0,5.0,2017-12-30,Seated quickly. Our server Irenmo extremely attentive. We didn't have to ask for anything because he was on it. Teriyaki burger was juicy and honey Dijon wings were delicious. Food was hot and beers were cold. Son loved the French fries and chicken. Thanks for a good lunch. And we appreciate the kid sized sinks in the restroom.. my son thought that was really cool!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland,3.24,2.96,2.96,,3.0720000000000005

I always get a red Robin cheeseburger but today I got it with the pretzel bites and they were actually really good! The hostess that helped me with my to go order was very polite and professional I'll definitely come back and dine in sometime!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland,3.32,3.0,3.0,,3.1280000000000006
