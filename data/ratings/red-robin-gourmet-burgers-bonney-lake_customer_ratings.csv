82,Vince M.,"Auburn, WA",14,10,1.0,3.0,2014-05-19,We have been going to Red Robin for years...in fact in 1980 I printed some of the original plexiglass lighted signs when they first were expanding from their Eastlake location in Seattle.  We received an invitation for a free meal for their grand opening.  The food was great like usual.  We went back again a week or two later.  Both times we were seated in the bar on tall tables.  This location is very small and they crammed too many tables in the bar.  It's hard for the servers to get between the tables and I felt like we were dining with the tables next to us.  I didn't look around at the other seating but all the bar tables seat two and I think if you come in as a party of two you will get stuck in the bar.  This arrangement of tables needs to change.  If I go back to this location and the bar is still set up that way and that is our only choice of seating I will go elsewhere.  I'm giving 4 stars for food and pricing but a 2 for the seating to average a three star,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=60,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

The tables are crammed together and it's not comfortable if you have small children.  Ordered an appetizer for 4 that we never received.  Never had my drink refilled, even after asking.  Asked for a box for leftovers multiple times before saying screw it.  We eat out a ridiculous amount per week and will not be coming back to this sardine can. If asked by friends or family if we've tried this location, which happens regularly, I will tell them to not waste their time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

As someone who works in the food industry (bartend/server) I understand how ""things happen"" and know that customer service is a HUGE priority. This place sadly lacks that. Walked in to see one hostess sitting down, and the one managing their desk didn't say hi or greet us....just gave us a blank stare. We (my mother and I) sat in the bar and were also given a blank and cold greeting by the bartender. Does anybody smile?!

Today was my oldest actual birthday and our youngest is on Jan 17th. As we arrived it took about 30 min to be seated which is fine it was a holiday we expected that.   then once we sat down it all went down hill. They took our orders then we all got our drinks but my husband didn't get his. Took almost 25 min for his to arrive at the table.  Then we ordered and asked for frys while waiting, we have done this every time going into a red robin. Our frys never came and finally our food  did. I let the waitress know it was our kids birthdays and last week I tried to add them to our red robin account under the kids/teen eclub section but every time I clicked on it the page said server unavailable so i was not able to add them. So i asked if they would honor it the manager came over said no and acted like i was crazy about the website. As we all finished our food we asked for more fries but my husband then asked are there more fries we asked for some while we were waiting and never received them. She then very rudley said they were busy and they don't have to bring out fries before our food only after.  The service was very slow, wouldn't honor our kids birthdays (it was obvious we were there for them as we had other family there celebrating), and our waitress was completely rude.  We won't be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=60,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

First they always try and put my family of four in the middle table which is in the way of everything.  They attempted to make a few more 4 spots so they have 3 tables that are directly in the middle of the restaurant. Second, if you go in during lunch time or any normal busy time expect to wait and wait wait when there are tables readily available. It's managed very poorly.

When you go to what it seems to be an entrance there is a sign asking you to make your ""grand entrance"" through the side door. Inside,the atmosphere is NOT AT ALL what you see at other Red Robins locations. Hostess is clueless and seemed like she was lost. Waitress was friendly but did not seem to pay attention to what she was doing. Took forever to bring my coffee and when she did it was cold. Our food was served by a very nice guy who happened to be the manager (which we did not know at that point). We didn't have any napkins and all the other waitresses seemed to be too busy to see we were trying to get their attention. We had not been to a Red Robin in quite a while, but last time we did, plates were not plastic/melamine and cheap looking. Plates were all greasy and looked like had been handled by 15 people before getting to us. Gross. In fact I was so grossed out I did not eat and told the waitress I wanted to talk to someone about it. Five minutes later, there comes the nice guy, which we learned was the manager,he brought our napkins (!!) and  listened to what I said with a look of dismay in hiss face. He did not appologize for the greasy and dirty looking plates, no. He said it is normal because the cooks wear gloves that get greasy (?) . I have eaten some greasy burguers before in many different places, and they were served in perfect clean plates. So no excuses here, please. He was nice enough to offer me a fresh made burguer since that one was already cold but I was totally thrown off  that I declined.He still had the waitress pack the burguer to go, and bring it to the table, and we were not charged for it. My husband had a couple of bites of his but was also displeased by the dirty plates, so we left to eat somewhere else.

I have been to this location a few times before and I've never been real impressed to be completely honest. The service and food are always very mediocre. There is no 'real entrance' like all of the other Red Robin restaurants I have been to. I swear the servers there are taught to ignore people who would like more bottomless fries. The one thing I do like is that they let adults order off of the kid's menu. I do not eat much, so it's nice to be able to pay for what I'll eat even though its a kid's meal. The actual location of this restaurant is good because its in the heart of Bonney Lake in a complex with a Famous Footwear, a Verizon, and a Bright Now Dental. Something I also found interesting is that I don't think I saw one male server while I was there. They were all younger females. Like most other Red Robin's, it was not a real quiet place. It's great for a kid's birthday dinner/party or a affordable family dinner, but I wouldn't say it's a great place for a nice first date. Also, this particular location is on the small side compared to other Red Robin's that I have been to. A lot of the times I'll see a group of teenagers that use it more as a hangout spot.

Please keep this guy. I never see him stop moving, he's always checking on us and he's a really nice guy. If I do come back, it's for Jason. Second, whoever the girl was in the pink quarter-sleeve shirt who was his supervisor or manager or whatever (I want to say her name was Nicole?) needs some serious one on one with someone who can teach her good customer service, because her awful attitude and constantly sour face made me nervous about asking her for anything. My fiancé asked Jason if it was okay if we could switch from fries to broccoli as our side after the first round; something we didn't think was that big of a deal. Well, according to pink shirt, that ""we don't really do that"" in a snotty tone, to which Jason tried to tell her it was okay and she snapped at him. Which, by the way, she was barking orders at Jason the entire night and acting extremely unprofessional. Between her bad attitude, the hostess looking like she was more invested in her phone than helping anyone, and Jason being the only helpful employee here, I probably won't be back for a while.

She had to work twice as hard to accomplish the same, not fair.  Our food was horrible. Our son got the kids hamburger meal.  What he got- two slices of bread and a slice of meat.  Nothing else not even any condiments.  We gave him lettuce and tomato off of ours. My salted caramel shake had no caramel in it, which I think the waitress realized cause she tried to put more in my shake for me.  My husband and I split the Guac/Bacon burger.  Um, could we have some guac please?  And I think there was some bacon on it, at least my husband claims there was.  Our family is on a strict budget so this was a real treat for us to be able to go out.

I ordered the crab cake Burger, which was on the seasonal menu. Excellent crab flavor, however the mayo type dressing on the burger was on the sweet side for me. The dessert was delicious but decadently chocolate. These were their brownie sticks that where dipped in chocolate and drizzled with sea salt. It came with a raspberry dipping sauce, which to me tasted too much like watered-down raspberry jelly. I liked the dessert without the sauce.  Service here was excellent.

48,Susan J.,"Enumclaw, WA",0,2,,2.0,2017-05-18,"We were a group of 8 women going out to celebrate with a departing co-worker.  We called a week ahead and asked for a table at 7:00.  The girl on the phone took our name and info.  Upon arriving, we were told they didn't have our info and do we know who we talked to? (blame game).  We waited a half hour for a table but were told we would get free appetizers for the inconvenience. Cool. We finally got seated, ordered, food was good.  Two of us overheard a busboy say "" did you notice how quiet it got once they got their food?"" Twice. Mind you none of us were drinking alcohol, we were just visiting.  When we went to leave my friend spoke to the hostess and reminded her of her offer of free appetizers and the fact that we didn't get them.  She asked if we had told our waitress. No, didn't think we had to. ""it must have been a miscommunication between the manager and the waitress"" (blame game). She also told her that it was a little rude overhearing the busboys comments to 2 different staff. Again excuses, ""are you sure he was talking about you?"" (as if that would matter).  I should add that our waitress was very nice and courteous.  When we left the hostess opened the door for everyone..that was our big reward I guess.  I probably will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
28,Rebekah H.,"Sumner, WA",50,20,5.0,1.0,2017-05-30,"So usually I like Red Robin's, but every time my husband and I have tried this specific Bonney Lake one it has never been a good experience. I figured after 3 crappy outings, it was time to post a review. In the past we've gone during somewhat busy times and have copped up our bad experience to their business. However, there was no excuse this time. We went on a Monday afternoon and arrived at 2:50PM so that we could enjoy their 3PM happy hour. Not only was our food lukewarm, but both batches of fries we received were burned. There was only 3 or 4 other people eating, and we still couldn't hear the waitress because she was talking too softly. At the end of eating our meal looking at the receipt only 1 of our 4 items were marked at happy hour prices. When we told the waitress, she told us prices were automated at time entered into the register. This wouldn't have bugged me so much except for the fact that we had told our waitress we were here for happy hour and ordered strictly from the happy hour menu. We would have happily waited a couple more minutes, or even if she had mentioned that these would be full price for another 10 minutes, I would have understood.  We ended up just paying it and probably won't come back to this specific one. There simply isn't any excuse for the over done food or the crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

38,Emily D.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-01,"I'm usually a fan of Red Robin, and not normally one to complain, but I want to deter people from coming here. We used to go for our birthdays, family gatherings, sometimes date nights, etc etc. This Red Robin establishment is a joke. When we first moved to Bonney Lake two years ago, the food was good and fresh. Now every time we go is worse than the last time. We finally hit a point where we refuse to come back after waiting a ridiculous amount of time to pick up an online order, having their bratty manager roll her eyes at us when we expressed our frustration at waiting so long when all we were looking for was an apology, and then opening up our order to find burned burger patties on soggy buns. YUCK. Red Robin, you need totally new staff here or you'll continue to lose customers. And fire your manager. Her reaction to our (completely justified) frustration was ridiculous and extremely unprofessional. Thankfully the Red Robin in Federal Way is much better tasting and better run than this absolute nightmare. Hopefully they'll renovate and get this place back to what it used to be, but until they do, we will no longer return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

21,Lynette A.,"Bonney Lake, WA",2,7,,2.0,2017-12-13,"I truly don't know if these reviews  do anything.  But here i go.  My husband ang i came into the bonney lake red Robin  for a late dinner.  9:15 pm.  Being gluten free there were few items that i could order.  One being the clam chowder.  The waitress brought mine, which was thick, but cold, and my husband's was watered down and cool. The waitress informed us that if we didn't like it we could get more. I tried mine, which was cold. I sent it back to warm it up. She didn't cone back with it. I questioned where it was. She threw it out. Never telling us that once it left the table  they can't put it in the microwave. I questioned her again about the soup and she snapped at me and said, I'll get my manger,""i don't have to be talked to like that"". Are you kidding me?  Guess we stop going to this red Robin. Gosh, where's the good service anymore.? It's not even closing time. Before wee even ordered they asked if we were going to have dessert because they were closing the ice cream machine down.  Are they open until 10 or what?  The manager took over our service. But we won't be coming here. I don't need to be treated like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bonney-lake,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
