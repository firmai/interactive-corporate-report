40,Charlie L.,"Orangeburg, NY",1,125,28.0,4.0,2012-11-04,"A year ago or so, this place did have some weird sh!t going on. I liked getting the burgers, and there was a time or 2 when the burger looked like it just came from a hurricane. Fast forward to today and luckily this place has improved a lot. I still get the burgers and they have been great. I almost always get the buffalo wings which are amazing.  It is a good thing they improved, because imo it would have suffered the same fate as the aweful Bennigans that used to be in New City, NY.

33,Jeff W.,"Hillsdale, NJ",92,434,33.0,1.0,2012-12-15,"I have said this countless times before, it's a chain, you know what to expect walking in. However, how you are treated makes or breaks the way things go. Case in point I was here with a friend for lunch and a few brews on a day off. The bartender was outrageously inattentive. There were barely any customers around and definitely by no means busy. She was more interested in talking to the regulars and playing with her iPhone then paying attention to customers whose glasses were empty for long periods of time. If I could take pictures of people and put ""Avoid"" under them, I would! Just an absolute shame, and she works for tips....didn't get much that day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet?start=20,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

Rude hostess seemed pissed that we walked in for a late lunch while they weren't busy. It took at least 15 minutes to get a waitress - and only after we flagged someone down (I guess the 7 occupied tables were a bit much to handle. Our waitress was nice enough even though she forgot our side order of guacamole (hence the 2, rather than 1, stars). The food was uniformly overcooked. Bathroom was disgusting.

Our supposed waiter didn't  even take our order and it was over 20 minutes when somebody finally came to say hi.  We order our drinks and food all at once since we had waited so long.  The kids meal which always comes out first took forever I had to stop our waiter, who never came to check on us if he could hurry it up since my child was starving.  Finally his food came and our food came 30 minutes later just when we were about to leave.  Not once did he come by to see if we needed anything but yet he kept going to the table next to us to make sure they were ok.  It was the WORST experience ever.

We waited over 15 minutes just to have our waitress come over and take our orders. The food took forever to get to us, and was on the cool side. And of course where we were seated, wasn't any better. It felt like the forgotten corner. We almost wore multiple trays of food as waiters were coming out of the kitchen while unsupervised children were running to and from the bathroom. We got here at 4:15, and didn't eat until 5:00.  The only reason I'll give it two stars, is for the fact our waitress was polite and tried to do her job. When she had a free moment or remembered us, she would get us refills on our drinks. Overall, I wasn't pleased.

Now, I've never had bitter ketchup but I imagine that this is what it would taste like. My sister got the chicken crispers which she apparently didn't care for too much either.

Me and my friends would eat and dine and laugh for hours. However, one day this chain started going down hill. This has to be the third poor experience I've had in Chilis. I have complained to corporate and decided to give it just 1 more chance to redeem it'self.  When we first came in we were seated and met the waitress in about 10mins, and she was very genial and pleasant, took our orders and got our drinks swiftly. She helped me make my decision in getting an entree. It was great until the going got tough. The restaurant started filling up and my drink was near empty. We got our food and were on our own. We ate and sat drumming our fingers until the waitress finally showed up, and waited even longer it seems to get the check.  By then my drink ran dry. She tried to refill it but it was already time to head out the door. My friend and I finally swore to never return - even if we are starving and on our last leg. Could've spent $5 bucks in McDonalds and sat in my friends car and have a better time than the one I did there. I mean I ordered Fajitas and they were good granted, but the food is like a 3/5. It's not going to burst my taste buds, but it'll do the trick. But eating out is about the experience...the ambiance...the atmosphere. NOT worth it.

I also go there often with a bunch of ten or so friends and all of us enjoy it.   We go towards the end of the lunch hour when the waiter/waitresses have time to put up with our dumb questions and mixed up orders.   There used to be a great manager named Tony who was also friendly and helpful and we hope to see him back after he recuperates from a recent illness.

I ordered the cajun chicken pasta which was ok. There wasnt much sauce at all. It was actually a pretty dry dish for stating it came with alfredo sauce.

3,Michael J.,"Ballston Spa, NY",1,70,66.0,4.0,2017-03-26,Had a great experience here the other night.  Had a short wait on a Saturday night but it wasn't bad!  Service was ok and the food was fantastic. I had the smokehouse platter which was a ton of food for $18.99 and it wasn't bad BBQ for a chain restaurant.  Apps were also very good (loaded boneless wings and mozzarella bites.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

4,Victoria R.,"Spring Valley, NY",72,36,,3.0,2017-06-23,We came on a Friday afternoon and we're seated right away even though it was pretty busy. Our server was nice and quick. I was happy with my food but after I ordered I saw the specials menu or new menu with better options and I wish I had seen that earlier. A suggestion-waiters can tell people about other menus for more options? The restaurant was nice but it smelled like wet dog and our seat was still a little dirty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
1,Elle N.,"Suffern, NY",0,7,9.0,3.0,2017-06-29,"Review your bill carefully!!  Came here on a weekday afternoon with 3 children. As soon as we got there, there was no hostess and took about 10 minutes before someone sat as down. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. Food is mediocre. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants since most of the food is frozen, fried and just downright unhealthy. Anyways when the bill came, I couldn't help but notice that there was a ""table entertainment"" charge for $1.99! What the heck! Then I realized it's for the tablets that they have on the tables! It would have been nice if I was notified that there would be a charge for using it! Sneaky move!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
