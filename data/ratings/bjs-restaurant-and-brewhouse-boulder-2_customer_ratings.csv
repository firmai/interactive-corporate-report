17,Mike B.,"Denver, CO",1,3,,1.0,2012-11-15,"Went in to meet a large group, and it was packed so I went to the bar to get a beer because the wait staff was ""taking a while."" I tried for five minutes to get the bartenders' attention and couldn't even get eye contact. Gave up and left. The floor was also waxed almost to the point of being a skating rink. I'm sure the food is the same mediocre junk you'll find at any BJ's, but the service here was extraordinarily bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007
74,Shana M.,"Louisville, CO",0,9,,1.0,2012-11-30,"This is not a good choice for dinner - at least it wasn't for us.   We sat for 15 minutes without being noticed by any waitstaff.. even though they walked by us several times waiting on other tables. We were ready to leave and possibly hop across the street to Baker Street Pub ... instead someone walked close enough to us that  I literally had to grab him to get his attention.  Yes, 2 minutes later... a waitress shows up.. hallelujah!  This was 8:00 pm, so not the busy dinner rush.  We ordered two entrees - a 'cobb' salad and a lemon chicken pasta dish. The pasta was horrible.  It was as if they had spilled a full salt shaker's contents on top of our dish.. it was extremely salty.  My husband likes salt and most of the time will even add salt to his food, but even he said this was over-the-top... WAY over the top on the salt, not edible.   So, the cobb salad was strange.  Not your usual cobb... it was tiny pieces of chopped, what looked like iceberg lettuce, a little bacon, crumbled feta I believe, and really unsure what else was on that salad.  It was also very salty.  Actually we weren't sure if it was just the massive salt in our mouths still from the pasta that we were still tasting, but nonetheless... not a good salad.  This food was WAY sub par for the price, and the service was lacking. When we told our waitress about our disappointment with our food, she did send out the manager to talk to us.  The manager seemed to insinuate that we were making up the salt thing... she said 'huh, not sure why it would taste like salt when we don't even add salt to that sauce...'... and 'maybe it was the ranch dressing... that can be salty'...    I don't know, it was SALTY manager, so please believe us and give us some credit.  Anyway, she took the food off of the bill, and so we paid for our beers and were on our way.... never to return.  Still hungry.  At least the beer gave us some nourishment until we could get home and eat PBJ's.   Sad, because we had been to the BJ's on Pearl Street back in the day, and it was really good food (pizza) and an enjoyable atmosphere/experience overall.  We also had lunch at the Westminster location previously and it was much better food and service than this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=80,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

The mac & cheese was ok - creamy but not really with cheese so much as butter and stuff, I wanted it to be thicker and have more cheese.   The root beer was good though, and DH enjoyed his dish, although with $3 and 3 pieces, it was a bit steep.

8,Vincent V.,"Seattle, WA",83,181,276.0,1.0,2013-01-28,"Very courteous and helpful service. Except for the tacos, the food appears too salty. Shrimp scampi comes with heavily seasoned (salt and lemon juice) which may appeal to you if you're a heavy drinker. When the waitress offered to ask the kitchen to make it less intense they made a new dish exactly the same way. The shrimp tasted good though.

That's an unpaid endorsement for the film ""I Love You Man"", it has nothing to do with this restaurant.  I work really close to BJ's and we used to come here for happy hour a lot. It feels like what it is- a big corporate restaurant that tries to pass itself off as a microbrewery.  The service here is super slow. Always. The happy hour pricing isn't even that good.

Finding a parking space took no less then ten minutes, but thankfully our friends had come early and already gotten a table. The waitress DID show up within a few minutes of us sitting down, but that was the only good thing she did. It took over 20 minutes to get water, the appetizers we ordered when we first sat down didn't show up until we complained to the manager. And at that point more then 60 minutes had passed. On more then one occasion the waitress forgot what we even had ordered and had to be reminded. The manager ended up giving us the appetizers and a round of drinks for free.

The other people at our table ordered pasta dishes.   I ordered a sandwich.   Mine was fine.  The others liked theirs. What was really outstanding, though, was our service.   The place was fairly crowded when we first arrived.   From beginning to end, though, we received excellent service.  That was nice.

I got the crispy chicken sandwich.  The chicken was dry, the bread decent, soft and not too crunchy.  The skinny fries were good.  Hubby got the gluten free pizza.  I tried a piece.  It was soggy and unappetizing, like a cheap frozen pizza that's been shoved to the back of the freezer.  The kind you eventually offer to your babysitter because you just don't want to have to eat it but don't want to throw it out.   Also, what's up with the plates?  The mozzarella sticks came out on a square plate.  I can accept square plates on the basis of easier storage, but frequently I find I need to turn the plate around to easier access something on it, and it's much easier to do with a round plate.  My sandwich and fries came out on an oval one, which I'll accept as a nod to sandwiches in those oval baskets, even though it forced them to cut my sandwich into an odd shape.   But the pizza . . . the ROUND pizza . . . came out on a TRIANGULAR plate.  Whose bright idea was THAT?   Also tried the Strawberry Patch.  Kind of like a pina colada, but with strawberries.  Not strong at all.  There were more drinks on the menu that I would want to try than any of the food.  Yeah.  I'm a sissy drinker, but if you put strawberries in it you'll get my attention.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=60,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

71,Ash C.,"Boulder, CO",4,52,32.0,3.0,2013-03-18,"First words of advice - - DON'T TRY THE PASTA HERE! We went here on a very busy Friday night, and it was packed. Good atmosphere, what i would expect from an all American family dining place with a sports type bar. We were seated pretty quickly and drinks came out on time.  I ordered one of the chicken pasta dishes can't remember exactly what it was. My pasta-  It came out lukewarm and soggy and flavorless. Theres really nothing to describe it except those 3 words. I wasn't that hungry to begin with so I just ate the artichokes and some salad. My friend who didn't order anything else but her pasta really couldn't stand hers. My pasta's chicken wasn't burnt like hers. She called a manager over and they sorted it out. She got a different entree altogether and was very pleased with one of the burgers. The fries that came with were very good! When the manager asked about my pasta dish, I just said I'd rather not get anything else, and that although mine was cold and flavorless and soggy as well, I ate most of the chicken so I wasn't expecting a totally new dish. When my bill came I was surprised that my entree was waived. I felt bad that they did that, since I ate most of my chicken and artichokes. I just didn't touch the spaghetti itself. But that was very thoughtful of them.  Service was great. The waiter was attentive even on a busy night and he was more than happy to bring the new dishes and ask how it was.  Food. The pizzas here are really delicious! So i assumed the pastas would be as well. Next time I'll just get pizza or a burger. The salads are pretty decent as well. I hope the next time I go and decide on a pasta, they will have changed something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-boulder-2?start=80,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003

65,Stephen B.,"Longmont, CO",4,11,,2.0,2014-02-23,"My family of  four went last night around 9:30 pm. For a Saturday night neither the bar area or the  restaurant appeared busy. There were several servers, busboys,and managers working. We were seated in a booth and assured our  server  would  be right over. Several of the staff passed by  our  table. After about 10 minutes, I told my wife that if no one came to our table be ]fore I  counted to 30, I would go to the  hostess stand to let them know we were still waiting on a server. Just then our  server showed up with two glasses of water for the  four of us, which I found odd. Why did she  only have 2 glasses of water? Incidentally, I told her that two glasses were plenty. If her plan was to bring us water, why not  bring all four at the same time. So, now  we have water. She was not ready to take our  drink order because she had to take care  of another table, so she left. Now I am feeling like the service is pretty poor. I have been to plenty of BJs locations, but this was my first time at the new one in Boulder. My wife and I both worked  in restaurants in college, so I am willing to give the waiter a pass if it is busy, or if they were double or triple sat. I surveyed the area, watched what our server was doing, and decided she was not ""in the weeds"". We finally got  our  drink order placed, and then our food order. The food was typically BJs quality. I have no complaints there. Through out the meal our server checked on us once twice, and left me waiting a fairly long time for my second beer.  Overall the service was mediocre. I am not really sure what the issue was with the server. Maybe lack of training, or maybe she just did not want to be there. She was nice enough and did not  give off that I am bothered by customers vibe that you  can get some times.

It was plopped on the plate with little attention to detail. The presentation was sloppy and uninviting. I had the the chicken club with bacon. The chicken had no flavor and the consistency of a dry sponge. The fries were obviously frozen and deep fried. My husband had the Maui Maui with some sort of citrus rice. The fish was dry, flavorless, and very poorly prepared. But the worst part of the dish was the rice. It was half boiled and tasted like they squeezed a bunch of lemon juice on it.  Next, the service. We were seated by a very nice host, who was joking and inviting. However, our server was obviously disinterested in providing us a decent dining experience. He took forever to get our drinks and never once asked us about a refill. When the entrees arrived, he never came to ask how the food tasted. Again, I'm a very forgiving customer.

Didn't realize it was a chain until the bartender mentioned it. For the most part, the food is just ok, not spectacular however, for the prices they charge, but the portions are large. Too salty though for me, so I have to ask them to skip all the salt where they can. I'll salt the food myself, if it needs it.  The last time I was in, on Halloween to watch game 4 of the Baseball World Series, I first ordered a thin crust pizza. It had waaaayyyy to much cheese on it, not enough veggies, and the crust was mushy. Made me feel a bit ill and almost killed my appetite. The waiter removed it from my bill and I ordered the Asian salad with chicken instead. It was a large dish, but also just ok. I thought the chicken was under cooked, so I pushed that all to the side. I took over half the salad home and recooked the chicken before daring to eat it the next day.  The alcohol selection is good, though one time I ordered an Irish coffee and it was terrible. The bartenders are wonderful people though, so I let it slide. I like the beer selection here and the wine choices are good as well. Service is a bit iffy at times. Earlier this year, I met a friend here for happy hour and we were ignored by our waitress. Waited 20 minutes for the waitress to come to our table with water and to take our order. And no, it wasn't busy. This was not good as my friend had some not so good news that day and she really needed cheering up. Having bad service only made her more unhappy and angry too. Needless to say, I left a very small tip and a note explaining why. The next time I came in, to meet others for happy hour, I asked the waitress to please not ignore us like the last girl did, and she made sure our table was covered well. Tipped her well for being on her game.  Noise levels here can get pretty loud, depending on when you come. My friends and family like to come here for the big screen TVs. I like those too, when I'm interested in a game, but putting the large one behind the bar into multi-screen mode is very distracting for some people, myself included.

This was our third visit to this location and we have yet to be disappointed!! We ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad to start. It was out of this world fantastic!! I wanted to take about five more orders of it home with me. The dressing was fresh and tasty and the tomatoes were just the right ripeness.  So, so yummy!!! My husband ordered the BJ's favorite pizza - as he always does. It did not let him down. (I don't like pizza, but I like this pizza.) I ordered the chicken and quinoa dish. (Don't remember it's ""official"" name.)The chicken was cooked to perfection! Very moist and flavorful. I liked the quinoa which was flavored with spinach, tomatoes and other good stuff. I loved it. My only ""complaint"" was that it had a sort of lemony flavor and I'm not a fan of lemony things. I looked at the menu and there was no mention of lemon. Next time I would order it and ask them to omit whatever gave it that aspect. (The server said they use several different types of oils and that it probably came from one of the oils.) I cannot remember the server's name, but she was GREAT! She did an excellent job and had a fun sense of humor. She seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. She said she has the mozzarella salad for lunch with avocado if that helps the manager identify her!  So, I'm going to end on a negative note. We dined there at 5:00 on Friday June 10th and it was FREEZING in there!!! My husband never gets cold and HE thought it was very cold as well. I think they were anticipating a big crowd later and were just trying to get ahead of things. We always have dessert, but were too cold. We drive from Lakewood to come to this BJ's.

I had the boneless wings because I haven't been able to find great wings since I moved away from the Midwest area, so I was really expecting something tasty. These were among the worst wings I've ever had. I probably ate 2-3 pieces because every bite had that weird tendony/chewy/gross part of the chicken texture and I couldn't stomach it.
