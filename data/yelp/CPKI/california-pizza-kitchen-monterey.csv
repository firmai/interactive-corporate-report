Luke B.,"Downtown, Memphis, TN",1,15,,2.0,6/29/2017,"The service was good but pizza and pasta were mediocre at best. If I'm going to spend over $50 at a chain restaurant i expect a little more flavor in my food.

Michelle C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1622,584,3174,4.0,1/17/2016,"BBQ chicken pizza. After shopping in Del Monte my sisters and I wanted a small snack. We ordered a frozen lemonade (good), a bbq chicken pizza with bacon, kids cheese pizza,a kids brownie and a kids ice cream scoop. Luckily we had a great server.  I don't really divert from the BBQ chicken pizza. It's tasty and the cilantro on top makes it pop. The kids pizza was a bit greasy. The brownie was very dense and I believe the ice cream is Haagen Daas. It's okie dokie by my standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=20
M G.,"Pacific Grove, CA",5,141,91,3.0,5/11/2017,Our server was great!  However due to things being pre-made we were unable to order what we wanted which was a big disappointment.....two of the dishes we wanted could not have scallions removed ..... margarita pizza was pretty good....house salad ok....blood orange sangria was EXTREMELY SWEET...almost like a syrup....not my cup of tea so to speak.    Butter cake good...change my life good...no....glad we had gift cards... again service good...host seating us nice and welcoming....underwhelmed with food....will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=20

Kyle C.,"Monterey, CA",108,25,4,4.0,10/20/2016,"Great food, awesome service, and cool atmosphere. Last night was my most recent trip and I sure did enjoy the food. Thai crunch salad with avocado really hit the spot while my girlfriend throughly enjoyed her Mahi tacos.  Service was swift and attentive. Drinks refilled with with ease.  Only reason it didn't get a 5 star from me is due to the very high prices.  Would recommend to try if your doing some shopping at the Del Monte Center and want to make a day of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=20

Kellie P.,"San Francisco, CA",42,187,,5.0,4/5/2016,"My boyfriend and I were in Monterey for the day, working a bridal fair. We were tired and hungry after, so we went to CPK. The server was friendly and great. The food was great. But the real reason this review is 5 stars is the service that I received after we left. Say whaaaat? Well, it turns out that I was so tired that I accidentally left my wallet behind and we got all the way home to San Francisco before I realized it was missing. I called CPK, and spoke to the manager (Brian) who said that nobody had turned it in yet but they would do a thorough search as they were cleaning for the night. Brian called back about an hour and a half later to say they found it. I was so relieved! I asked that they mail it to me, expecting that it would take several days to arrive. But Brian called me the next day to tell me that he was sending via FedEx and it should be there the next day. We ate there on Sunday night, and it's Tuesday morning right now and my wallet is back in my hands with nothing missing inside. THANK YOU to Brian Marshall and the whole CPK staff for the great food and amazing service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=20

We really liked the patio seating and appreciated that it is pet friendly.  The service & staff at this location were always great.  Our meals always came out quickly and drink refills were promptly taken care of.   The food was tasty and fresh too!  The CPK is located in a shopping mall just off the highway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=20
Cheesecake D.,"Monterey, CA",35,8,28,5.0,2/1/2016,"Today I ordered online a half Chopped Italian Salad to be picked up Curbside. I got back to work and realized they didn't give me the dressing. I called back to find out if they might have tossed the salad in the dressing but they said they usually put it on the side. I told them that I didn't get one. She apologized & said she'd get the manager. Before I said it was ok she had put me on hold. She came back on the phone to tell me they would bring me a dressing in which I said it was ok. She insisted & got the address for my work which she said she could be there in 8 minutes.  She said her name was Danielle & told me what she'd be driving. I went out to meet her & not only did she bring me 2 dressings, she said the manager, Pete gave me a complimentary piece of Red Velvet cake as well! I've never had such great customer service over one dressing. Thanks Danielle, Pete & CPK!

Krystle T.,"Arcadia, CA",392,417,1397,4.0,2/8/2015,"When I crave pizza in CA, I think of CPK (sometimes): the name is just so convenient.  Price: Typical. Look to pay about $15 for a pizza. Parking: LOT Service: Friendly and fast. For those getting take out, they have curbside pick up so you can just chill in your car while you wait for pizza! Food: I always get the mushroom pizza because I love mushrooms. So mushroomy and delish. No red sauce though... I asked for this on a thin crust which was an additional $2(?). Notes: Nothing really stood out from the other CPKs I've been to other than the company, I suppose. Overall: If I want to play it safe and simple, I'll come here for pizza, otherwise, it's nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=20
Janice C.,"San Francisco, CA",530,2174,5892,4.0,12/1/2013,"Let's face it. CPK's pizza? not the most authentic, but definitely delicious! Especially if I'm in the burbs and have to eat at a chain restaurant, CPK will always trump Cheesecake Factory or PF Chang's. The sangria has a weird off taste to it, probably because of the added cranberry juice. Well, I'm not one to waste alcohol so I still finished it.  ;-)   pair that with their ever reliable mushroom-sausage-pepperoni pizza and you really can't go wrong.

Miran C.,"San Francisco, CA",272,575,200,5.0,7/29/2014,"I am reviewing online ordering, CPK salads, and curbside pick-up.   Really convenient and so much tastier than Safeway salads.  Granted, the CPK salad is 3x the price of a Safeway salad, but the chicken is much fresher and the quantity is gigantic (it became my lunch and dinner).  I know, I sound unpleasantly cheap when I make a CPK salad sound like a splurge. Anyway, my favorite is the Chinese chicken salad (thank goodness it is not called the Oriental chicken salad).  Free bread and olive oil dip, too.  Yum!     Online ordering  on my phone was very convenient.  I chose to provide payment upon pickup.  Plus, the service at curbside was very nice and fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=40
Kate F.,"Monterey, CA",1,49,1,5.0,4/16/2016,"I was never really a CPK fan before I went here one night. And the pizza was actually really good! The customer service is also really great. Both when you dine-in and also when you do take-out. Their take out is super easy and the food tastes just as good. My only complaints are that it's a bit pricier than other pizza places (example: $17.00 for a Sicilian which is a flatbread pizza, not too large either) but it's worth it for me. The only other complaint I have is sometimes the pizza isn't served as hot as I'd like it, but maybe that's more of a personal preference. Otherwise, I love this location of CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=40
M C.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/24/2016,Be warn missing Chicken. If you find it let me know. This was my first time going. Thought I would try this place out. Ordered the kung pao spaghetti. The overall taste was good. But my only complain is the portion of chicken in the plate. If it had  2 ounces of chicken that would be exaggerating. The chicken was so little that it looked like the peanuts that were also in the dish. Mind you I was not the only one with this complaint my wifes zuchini chicken pasta was also the same about a ounce of chicken. As well as my sister in laws fetucine was short on the poultry. Safe to say I will no longer be eating at this establishment again. Very disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=40

Joe I.,"Salinas, CA",0,24,23,3.0,6/1/2015,You are better off going somewhere else for pizza if you are hungry. We ordered habanero and barbecue chicken pizza and they both hardly had any ingredients on them. Very skimpy. I like my pizza with lots of cheese and sauce and toppings . We always go to Giannis on Light House Ave and will stick that if ever wanting pizza in Monterey again.  Flavors are good but way too small and skimpy for pizza. I like leftovers and a nice crust. This reminded me of a tortilla with skimpy toppings on top. I hate to see what the thin crust looks like.  Server was very nice and it's a nice place inside just wish the food was a little heartier and not so cheapo.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=40
Stephanie N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,8,5,5.0,7/23/2016,"Every time we eat here I'm impressed with the level of service and the fantastic pizza. My personal favorite, pear & gorgonzola pizza, is perfection. They have a great manager working at this location. He's always walking around visiting the customers, helping his staff. He's a great leader by example. Cpk offers the deals with your phone number and military discounts. Atmosphere is nice in both the bar or restaurant.  You can watch the pizza go into the big fire oven.

Leah P.,"Gibbon, MN",5,80,5,3.0,3/19/2012,"Maybe my taste buds are changing. I used to really like CPK but now it's really only Meh. I think ever since they took the fresh summer rolls off the appetizer menu I haven't been as excited to return. I went back yesterday only because my beau had never been to a CPK and I wasn't in the mood to cook at home and we were already at Whole Foods at the mall.  The pea and barley soup lacked flavor, I don't think it was spiced with anything more than salt and pepper.. and i added more pepper to it.  The focaccia was soft and warm and cheap so that got my approval even though I typically try to shy away from breads.  The veggie pizza with eggplant left me wanting something with some extra flavor so I added chili flakes.. which did very little.  All in all I doubt I will be returning to a CPK any time soon.

Down-marks for the noise.  This location seems to attract a lot of families with noisy kids.  There are always infants in booster seats somewhere in the restaurant throwing tomato slices on the floor.   Also, down-marks for dropping Tortilla Soup from the menu.  My family used to make an afternoon of coming to CPK for a bowl of tortilla soup before heading over to the movie theatre. Plus marks for the great pizza.  They have interesting combinations that you might not think would work, but they surprise you when you try them.  Be adventurous with the menu; you will be rewarded.

The Waldorf salad is still a star and its always a must have.  Moms loves the Greek pizza and bf enjoys the pastas.  Portions are nice and we always have a little left over for lunch the next day.  However, the quality of food they've been serving hasn't been matching their set prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=120

Since I was by myself I was unsure of how i would be treated. (you know sometimes they give you a look since your eating alone, like you need an excuse or the waitress is think she is going to get a little tip since the bill will be small) but the place was not that bad.  The waitress was very nice talking to me about how she moved out to Monterey for school, pointing out certain points about the city since I was on a job detail that might have me out there permanently.  When I went I was informed that half of the menu was not available for some reason, lack of ingredients so I choose a pizza that they still had. (This was an incovienace because I love chooses, but I am sure that it does not happen every time.)  The food was pretty good. I would not rate the pizza in my top 5 but possibly top 10. I got some apps and it was so small I wouldn't even call it an appetizer I would just call if an izer.

Shiho F.,"Carmel by the Sea, CA",4970,2834,2440,3.0,5/17/2012,"Overall a decent dinner and wonderful service.  I got my usual Waldorf Salad but unfortunately it came with some browned Granny Smith Apples that were far from crisp and turned into apple sauce when I bit into them, mealy if you will.  Doused in their lovely ranch, I almost didn't notice.  The Cobb was fine and my friend devoured her plate of Avocado Club Eggrolls and again service couldn't have been better. My only issue is their Gluten Free menu... so happy that they've adopted one but they need to follow through.  According to their website they are working with the Gluten Intolerance Group or GIG.  I think they need to do a refresher course as my Sedona Soup sans the tortilla chip toppings definately had wheat in it.  My allergy is so severe that I get crazy sysmptoms within seconds.  I've never had a problem with any of their salads or dressing (thank the food gods) but one sip of this soup and I immediately got congested, my stomach started to bloat and within a minute I looked like I had gone from maybe prego to 8 months... if you think I'm kidding come what me lick flour off your counter.  Bowling ball in my gut, inflamations all around (lower back and neck pain) and here's the kicker, I get open sore welts... well maybe not that bad, but huge pimples that not only hurt but pretty much blow up.  Gross.  I'm sorry but it's true.   I know people think I'm crazy and that I shouldn't eat out.  I probably shouldn't but that's like telling Valentino Rossi to stop racing or telling Nicki Minaj to stop with the pop-y tunes (not to mention somehow catchy) and ridiculous costumes.  It's not going to happen as it's probably one of my favorite things to do.   If there is no wheat in the soup (perhaps MSG?) then I'm sorry but they will need to take extra care to not cross contaminate the food.  For ex. If someone places a gluten topping on the soup and fishes it out... it still contains gluten, or if they keep the soups near the flour used to make pizza... not the best idea.  I'm just throwing it out there and surprisingly and comforting to me... the more I talk about it, the more I hear that I'm not the only one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=120

Years and years ago, I joked with a friend about designer pizza. We tickled each other's funny bones by dreaming up warped combinations, and I came up with an abomination: Chinese pizza. Then, a few years after that, CPK comes up with--Chinese pizza (they call it something else--Wonton pizza? Peking Duck pizza?--I don't think it's on the menu anymore). Um, wow! It was actually really good. Other designer pizzas here are also yummy. I'm also a fan of their appetizers, like the Tuscan bean soup, Tuscan hummus, and especially the Spinach Artichoke Dip (nobody doesn't love CPK's Spinach Artichoke Dip!).

That said, it is extremely frustrating that a business (a company interested in actually making profits) does not accept takeout orders at 9:15pm. Really?? They close at 10pm yet they don't have time to make a thin crust pizza and salad in the 45 minutes remaining until closing time. What's even more annoying is the fact if you were to dine-in they would seat you at 9:15.  Annoyed at this asinine policy, I called CPK back and asked to speak to the manager. The 12 year-old girl who answered the phone could barely even handle picking up the phone and saying ""hello"" let alone actually connect me to the manager. She hung up after telling me to hold on. Not particularly satisfied with this level of service, I called back again. The same moron picked up the phone and put us on hold for about 1 minute and then disconnected the line, again.  CPK, whoever you had working the phone on 11/31/13 at 9:15pm should probably just work as a hostess -- although I'm not certain she could handle writing down names there's certainly a chance she'd fare better at that than answering the phone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=120

For $14 or thereabouts (big enough to serve two people), it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect at least an entire half breast.  I might give them another try and ask them to put the chicken ON TOP of the salad, so that I can see right away whether there are only 3 or 4 little morsels.

I added the chicken for some extra protein.  I got the half salad and one of their small bites of focaccia bread with olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and herbs.    The salad was excellent!  The bread was tasty, but really seemed like what most restaurants would bring as a ""freebie""...but that was $2.50, so no biggie.  Service was very good.  The check came to almost $16.00, which I think is expensive for a half salad and some bread.  I'd come back, but not on a regular basis.  It's definitely a pricey place to eat, I think.  Overall, a good experience.

I didnt get his name but he was a taller, black guy and if management reads these, GIVE HIM A RAISE! Very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. Our server was also great. The reason I am writing this review though is because of our pizza. I have never been a judge of pizza because to me, all pizza is good haha. Ive had about 40+ pizza's from this place and the meat craver's pizza WAS THE BEST! All sorts of meats on this pizza but the magic behind the pizza last night was the CRUST! Oh my goodness. Just a very light tinge to the outside of the crust and the inside was melt in your mouth deliciousness! 2 THUMBS UP to the chef that was there last night. I was so impressed that I even made a comment to the gentleman that helped us earlier. Another cool part was we went in at 8pm and they close at 9pm and no one made us feel rushed or even seemed to be in a hurry to get out of there. That really impressed me. Good Job CPK.

Jenna M.,"Salinas, CA",3,15,4,5.0,8/17/2012,"It had been several years since I've eaten here.  I don't think it was for any particular reason that I stopped going, perhaps it just seemed overpriced.  However, I decided to give it another shot and I am very glad that I did!  There is a reason that this place is always bustling!  And the pizzas we ordered were well worth their price! The wait time was reasonable and I appreciated the seating layout. We were given a booth that is raised about a foot off the ground. This is a great design because even though the restaurant was very full, I could see over the other tables and therefore did not feel crowded in. Our server Jose was very friendly and helpful when we mentioned that we were more or less newbies.  He proclaimed that CPK's motto was ""Be Adventurous"", so we could feel free to try something new and exotic. And if we absolutely hated it, they'd make us something else.  Well no worries there because our 2 pizzas were absolutely delicious! We got their signature pizza with BBQ Chicken and Apple-wood Bacon, as well as a Pear & Gorgonzola pizza, as well as their fried mac&cheese appetizer -which was sinfully great!  3 extremely different taste options, but they were all excellent! Be warned, this is not your average pizza place. Don't come here if all you want is pepperoni and cheese on thick, chewy bread. But do come here if you want to try delicious gourmet concoctions that just happen to lay on a thin pizza crust.  Granted, the unique factor can be somewhat startling at first. I was very surprised when my pizza arrived covered in what appeared to be a salad.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted great, but I was not keen on eating a salad-covered-pizza with a knife and fork. So I pushed my greens off to the side and dug into the pizza.  That first bite reminds you that this is not your average pizza.  Once you let your brain register that, you can simply enjoy the delicious flavors.

I never have to check my order and there's always extra bread and chili flakes even when I don't ask for it anymore. They just know me and I really really appreciate that.  I never order pizza here but I love the tomato basil spaghettini with goat cheese and grilled chicken. I'm not suppose to eat wheat or I break out in a rash but oh my gosh is it worth it! Something about those tiny little noodle strands mixed together with plum tomatoes and goat cheese with a hint of rosemary from the chicken makes me do a happy dance in my seat.  I usually get the same takeout person which is probably why he gives me the equivalent of two loaves of bread at any of time of day and promptly dumps a handful of chili pepper flakes.

Dashoo S.,"Monterey, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/5/2016,"As a former (disgruntled) employee, I have to pitch in my two cents. I was treated wrongly here after undergoing training and the management could absolutely care less about me leaving. Never apologized or explained their motives for removing my shifts constantly, and never giving me a chance to work. It was the worst experience I've ever had and I was very disappointed because I had high hopes that the staff would somehow make their new team members feel as a part of their team but they do not. Even though the entire training emphasized this, which is so ironic. Not only that but I was mistreated by a coworker at the time who was supposed to be training me for my new position. Instead I was ignored the entire night until I asked for constructive criticism at the end of the shift, but instead she went on to criticize my appearance. This place is extremely unprofessional in the way they handle new employees. Oh and also, the food is horrendously overpriced. Not from a biased opinion, but from a former customer who had eaten here plenty of times before being hired. Make your own pizzas at home with 2x the toppings for half the price. Overall, this place left a bad taste in my mouth from the rude staff and both the food. There is indeed a reason for the other low reviews.

The avocado egg rolls remind me of a chicken club- bacon avocado and chicken with cheese.  I like these on a sandwich better than a roll.  Service was a bit slow.

I, too, have some prejudice against this place for being a chain, but when I really think about it, I never had a bad dining experience here. The food options are great, and it was always really delicious. I tried a lot of different pizzas from their menu, as well as some of the pasta entrees. The bread with oil and vinegar was pretty delicious all by itself.  I went there a lot. Towards the end of my time in Monterey I got one of the Thai pasta dishes most of the time. It was tasty and spicy, just how I like it. Having found nothing wrong with this place other than the fact that it's a chain, I have given it five stars. If you've never tried it, you should.

It's the only sandwich on the menu I would order. I have had the Sicilian Pizza a few times in the past. Pretty good. Better than the ones you can buy at Safeway and cook at home. Try it at the restaurant, it's good.  So it's not just a pizza joint but a place with lots of salads which the women love and other stuff for us guys. It's not Iolis (Carmel Valley) but ok for a chain place.  The service was excellent and the food came about as I would expect it, slow. Good if you are in the area and hungry. I was.

Ralph T.,"Stateline, NV",14,438,28,3.0,12/2/2011,"Dined here with the family I know it's CPK but really talk about rushing you out the door. Luckily with our group of five we were seated in a booth without having to wait on a Friday evening.  Service was quick if not annoying and pushy. The server was a little too friendly and wanted to be part of the group.  She checked back several times throughout the meal which was good, but each time it was a conversation that interrupted our meal.  A short is everything OK would suffice. I ordered the Moroccan Chicken salad, half order, it was big.  A full order probably would have taken two plates.  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were well blended.  I also had the Tortilla Spring Rolls one with Thai chicken and the other with Baja chicken.  They were good but the Thai sauce was excellent. The Baja chicken was served with a small side of guacamole.  Good serving size. Between the salad and the spring rolls I was full. My wife had the Roasted garlic chicken pizza. She said it was good with great garlic flavor. Our server asked the girls if they wanted another glass of wine, each said yes.  They brought the other glass. When our server came by she asked if she could pour the remnants of the other glass into the new glass, the girls had not finished their first wine.  I didn't think this was proper. At the end of the meal we ordered a Sunday for my granddaughter.  Before the dessert was brought the server left the bill.  I guess we were done.  She also tried to take my spring rolls before I was done.  Again, I know they live on turnover but really let your customers relax and maybe I'll leave a bigger tip. Overall, except for the service, the food was good for CPK.  I have eaten here before with my granddaughter and the service was not so abrasive.   If you are dining with little ones this is the place to go.  Good food, fast service but not cheap.  For five of us it was 80.00 without the alcohol.  Wine cost was on the high side for this type of restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=100

Alright, getting over the guilt.  My last experience there was a disaster. The food took FOREVER and mine was a grilled chicken breast, plain, with no oil. Simple. It took 45 minutes. The server took about 20 minutes getting my friends and I WATER.  My best friend and I decided to try it one more time tonight. What server shows up at our table? Same one. The guy had said he was fairly new the last time, so I thought maybe after 2 months, he would have gotten his act together. I thought wrong. I decided to order a salad. Instead of the chicken offered on the salad, I asked for a plain, grilled chicken breast, grilled with no oil (I've served for 3 years, and this is extremely simple to do). I also asked for mushrooms to be added to the salad (also about as simple as it gets). When the food came out, my salad was completely wrong. The chicken was an oily mess. It was the chicken I had specifically requested NOT to have. Also, no mushrooms.  Our server said he would fix it right away.  It took 25 MORE minutes (after the initial 30 minute wait) to get this salad out.  By this time, I was eating my fork and I was irritated beyond belief. This has happened before. I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but alas, they failed.  Oh, and to top it off, THE SERVER CHARGED ME. I do give credit to the manager. He tried his best to amend the situation (like saying he was going to take the salad off the tab, but the server didn't show him the ticket). I told him not to worry about it.  They won't be getting my money ever again anyway.  Sorry CPK. I'm never coming back. I've given you way too many chances.

We put the frozen banana on a fork, and he just gnawed on it so happily! So that was fantastic! In fact our whole first half hour was great.

When we got dinner, it was great, though. We were very pleased with it.

(and my son had a simple sundae with his kids meal) It took sooooo long to get to us. Probably 20 minutes or so? It took forever. And then nobody checked up on us and I really wish someone had. I was enjoying one of the first bites of shortcake, when... oh no! I got a bite of a garlic/oniony flavor. It was awful!! Not at all what I expected. I think I got a crouton. Ok, so sometimes things fall in and I guess we deal... that's fine. But a few bites later I got another garlic bite. Gross. I wasn't happy at that point since we still didn't even have the bill or anything. We pulled another server at that point to get us our bill, paid and tipped and when I left I mentioned it to my server (would have told her earlier had she ever checked up on us!)

I wasn't expecting much from our server just by the way he carried himself. Once we did get the salads, it was good, not great, but sufficient. I also ordered a Paloma cocktail. It's apparently new to the menu and it shows by how it was prepared. All I tasted was watered down tequila and just the tiniest hint of of passion fruit.  I think it tasted watered down because of the amount of ice they put in the glass. By far the worst cocktail I have ever ordered! When the pizza arrived, the bad taste in my mouth changed for the better. I ordered the Sicilian, a CPK favorite. The pizza had all the flavors I was looking for to fix my cravings. Its a thin crust pizza and has Spicy marinara with Italian sausage, spicy Capicola ham, salami, Fontina, Mozzarella and Grana Padano Parmesan. Topped with herbs. After we had finished, at least 10 minutes went by before our server presented the check. He informed us that his shift was over, but that a waitress would take care of us. The waitress never came, so after 5 minutes we walked up to the deserted hostess stand. We stood there at least a good 2 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. When some one finally did notice us, it looked like the manager, she seemed too busy to take care of it herself and wasted more of our time while finding someone to except our money! Overall I gave this place a 3 star even though they deserved a 2.5. I went there craving pizza, and the pizza was the only thing that was great about the whole lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=140
Jennifer D.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",2010,646,2275,4.0,9/12/2017,"I enjoy California Pizza Kitchen more than other similar chains. No matter where you go they are pretty consistent with food and service.  This location was very large and super clean. Our waiter was excellent and the manager even came by to assist him with drink refills and clearing the table (even though he was doing great on his own).  Overall, great meal and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey
Probie-One Five -.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",94,38,62,1.0,12/7/2017,wOw. Can I give a ZERO?   No bread.  No ice in the iced tea.  Asked for a glass of ice. Never arrived.  Asked for red sauce on my pizza.  Received NO SAUCE.  Finally got a small down of red sauce .. on the side.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey
Eliza S.,"Carmel, CA",25,20,,1.0,8/27/2017,I love the thai crunch salad or oriental chicken salad but recently they have been sooooo cheap with the portions and messing up on sides Tonight we ordered the sicilian pizza. There was no cheese and it was burnt! Shame on you Monterey CPK. NIce way to rip People off. More pricey less quality!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey
Kristian C.,"Monterey, CA",183,122,453,2.0,7/5/2017,"I don't know why I do this to myself. We wanted something to eat were we usually don't go. We ended up here. Such a vanilla place. I guess it has its draw of families with kids or tweens on dates wanting to feel like they are adults. Really strange, lots of teens on dates? I remember that, wanting to impress the beautiful lady who said yes, I know, I'll take her to Olive Garden! yup Nothing really great about this place, or the chain. Competition is starting to eat into their market share. Blaze pizza and Pieology, where you can create your own pizza in half the time, half the cost, and no tipping needed.  Please do yourself a favor and skip this joint.  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey

Neil E.,"Charleston, SC",2,71,8,5.0,12/24/2017,"I sat at the bar and had an individual pizza.  Flavors were great. I also had an IPA beer which tasted good.  I've had ipa beers at other establishments that were less tasty.  So whomever is choosing the beer to supply made a good choice. The bar is a great design feature on CPk's part.  When it's busy, I can sit at the bar and not worry about being seated in a booth next to crying babies and screaming kids manipulating their parents with their whining.  The bar tender was very pleasant and checked in on me on occasion.   Really made the effort to ensure I wasn't forgotten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey
Veronica O.,"Paso Robles, CA",115,83,528,5.0,8/13/2016,"I love this CPK. Great set up and yummy food. I live in an area with very few chain restaurants so chains are a great for me. You can't go wrong with their hand tossed pizzas or fresh salads. Always consistent and yummy and great price.  This one is by the Del Monte Mall so great to fill up before some shopping.  The manager Pete took time to say hello and chat. Feels like a great personally owned restaurant vs a chain.  Great beers on tap and they had my favorite...805, yum.  It is a little hidden as is the entire mall so type it in your nav and visit the interior section of the mall as well. Garden setting with gorgeous plants and amazing areas to grab a coffee and chill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey
Kate B.,"Irvine, CA",233,239,350,5.0,7/13/2016,"Updating my review again. I can't say enough good about this CPK location. Pete Marconi is the best manager at this location. He is always there and is always making sure everyone is happy. I can't say enough good about him.  I recently ordered the coconut blossom cocktail and it is by far my new favorite drink. It was just right. The food is always spectacular here.   Gabe is one of the new servers on the CPK team and we had the opportunity to sit in his section tonight. We've eaten here over 30 times this past year and Gabe far surpassed all service experiences. He's a keeper!! Along with Pete Marconi and the other primary manager, they operate this CPK the best I've ever seen.  Job well done. Keep up all the great work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey

We will definitely be back. They not only have pizza, but a great variety of other dishes. We highly recommend the carne asada pizza, it's incredible. We also had the mac and cheese small plate and that was so yummy! The fish tacos are also very good. Shout out the best server in town, Mikaela!

Jen C.,"Marina, CA",0,14,1,2.0,9/8/2017,"I ordered the Thai chicken pizza, my favorite. Unfortunately it was more like Thai peanut pizza. I counted 5 maybe 6 pieces of chicken on the whole 6 piece pizza which was literally covered in crushed peanuts. A far cry from the last time I had it at a different location which used peanut halves and a good ratio of chicken, cheese and other ingredients. Unfortunately this was a big letdown. The peanut sauce I had leftover from my appetizer was a real savior here because the pizza was barely sauced so thank heavens for two well filled bowls of sauce with my Thai spring rolls. The service was friendly even if the management seemed a little clueless. Overall not an awful experience just wish the food quality was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey
Taylor M.,"Marina, CA",0,10,1,3.0,9/2/2017,"Tried this place a few times since we live pretty close. Nothing special about this pizza, nothing 'wrong' either... it's a chain so I don't expect to be wowed. They get really busy so curb side pick up  is super unreliable (often turns a 20 minute wait into a 45 minute wait). Staff is friendly and quick to resolve any issues and if you choose to dine-in, staff is prompt and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey

SnibD D.,"Monterey, CA",40,27,56,4.0,1/16/2017,"Since CPK came to the mall in NY I never tried it, it may have been the name.  Born and raised eating NY Italian pizza from a pizza parlor owned and operated by Pat and Tony, why bother right?  Well, after coming to the coast and state of this establishment I was finally forced to try it.  We took my daughter out for getting all As this quarter and she chose CPK after our movie.  I was hesitant and it took me a while because I don't require a lot of these toppings on my pizza.  Well to start, we had Gabe the server and he was spot on with his recommendations and suggestions.  I always like to ask the servers what they would eat or do eat from the restaurants they are serving us in.  They do not have traditional buffalo wings as an app and we asked about the buffalo cauliflower he said it taste just like chicken.  We all laughed and said yeah right Gabe, but we ordered it anyway.  It was amazing and Gabe was right! They do something to give it a crunch on the outside like fried and sauced wings.  My daughter has been asking me to try to make at home prior and this app has encouraged me to try because I kept telling her no I'll just make the wings.   I am very particular about my beverage and the bar did not disappoint-a Long Island Ice Tea shaken and poured no ice in my drink-it was refreshing and I only needed one!!! As for the pizza I tried the Margherita, my daughter did the BBQ chicken with bits of bacon, and my husband got a chipotle one w/beans, corn, and some other stuff on it.  When the pizza came out the table was silent due to all the eating that was occurring.   Happy I tried it it is a good dining option now that pizza parlors aren't readily accessible.  Thanks Gabe and CPK we will be back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey

Carolina G.,"Monterey, CA",174,108,44,4.0,3/21/2016,"Very accommodating, if perhaps a little slow on the service end. I've had many experiences where if the pizza and drinks are not to our liking, they'll send them back. Indeed, there was one time where I ordered a vegetarian pizza, and somehow ended up with a meat one. The manager was horrified at this lapse, and in seeking to avoid offending me, he or she (I don't remember) sent me a new pizza and did not charge for my food.  Anyhoo. This place serves consistently good pizza; the last two times I've had the Five Cheese and California Veggie pizza. CPK is great for kids, and my son is constantly asking to come here. This CPK is also a staple with my family when we are eating in groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey
