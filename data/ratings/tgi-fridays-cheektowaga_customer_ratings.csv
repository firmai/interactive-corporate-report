10,Nana V.,"Bellingham, WA",2,47,,2.0,2013-07-30,Two stars is me being generous.  The fries were too salty and cold. The drink I ordered was so sweet it burnt my mouth.  The desert chocolate brownie was a thin crust with warm melted ice cream.  My coffee had a bright red lipstick ring on the mug.  But the servers were nice.  It was not worth my money.

13,Matt C.,"Depew, NY",2,21,3.0,2.0,2014-01-03,"I haven't been to this location in forever. Went actually due to someone giving me a gift card.  After being seated, it took a few minutes for the waitress to come around, but it wasn't that bad of a wait. She was nice, which excused the slight wait.  The food is decent, but not something that I have to go back for. I suggest the boneless wings if anything. Menu is a tad bit pricey, but acceptable.  The main problem with this place is that it definitely needs to be cleaned. The menus had food on them, and the booths were equally dirty. The TV in the booth (which is a nice touch, but some of the cable channels come in snowy), was very dirty. Looked as if no one cleaned them for a long while. Fingerprints and smears on them. This location definitely needs to step up their cleaning game. Maybe have the hostess that was just standing around doing nothing but watch the bar TV's do something productive?? Just a suggestion I guess..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga?start=20,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736
6,James S.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5,8,4.0,3.0,2014-06-27,"First visit to Friday's since they've re-done the menu. Menu is now a fancy book with paper pages. Food was good quality but disappointing in places. They've reduced portion size on some dishes. The pretzel dish with beer-cheese dip now has about 50% less cheese than before which was a big let down as its a personal favourite They've added a few new cocktails, including shakers which were a nice addition to the menu. The service was excellent however, and made up for the issues with food. When we mentioned about the reduced size of the dip and second dip was brought out on the house.

23,Dennise R.,"Buffalo, NY",101,131,410.0,3.0,2014-11-21,"I have to say that this place has made a huge 180º. After having a few not-so-memorable experiences eating here I was very happy to see the improvement in food and menu quality... yes I said menu quality. I really like their new menu design look. I especially enjoy their choice of paper stock. My drink of choice for the night was The BFM, which is basically a Cadillac Margarita. It was very good. Since Friday's loves to do their 2-1 drink I decided to have 2. For appetizers I had the Bacon Mac & Cheese bites. I could have eaten 10 of those! But I had to console my self with only two, since I wasn't by myself and I guess Sharing is Caring.. blah, blah, blah.... Anyway, they were 4 delicious little balls of fried mac and cheese with bacon sitting in a plate of cheese and bacon sauce with a piece of fried bacon on top. .....Bacon As my main course I had the Craft Beer-Cheese Burger. I was craving a good burger and this did not disappoint. The burger comes with chipotle mayo but I ordered that on the side because my partner doesn't like mayo and again, sharing is caring so on the side it went. This burger besides having delicious beer-cheese it also had jalapeños and guacamole. It had the perfect kick. Hot but not, OMG my mouth is on fire hot! I also have to make a note about the service. Our server Daniel T. was perfect. Funny and attentive.

29,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1286,982,738.0,2.0,2016-01-18,"If you're thinking about it, don't. Stopped in around 10:00 with some friends because it was the only restaurant that was open late on a Sunday other than Applebees. We were seated right away and the place was pretty vacant at this hour with the exception of a few people sitting around the bar. We were seated at a five person table which was odd considering we were four and a four person booth would have made a bit more sense to me. Nevertheless, the seating was fine and our server came over to take drink orders shortly after we were all seated. In all honesty, the service was really sloppy for lack of a better word. From the way he was dressed to his mannerisms, it was unprofessional from start to finish. Yes, Fridays has a casual atmosphere, but his shirt didn't look clean, it was a hanes t-shirt, he didn't stand up straight at the table, it was way way too casual of a demeanor and it was really evident. When I asked about the tuna tartare appetizer and if it was any good, his response was, ""Well I don't eat fish so."" Yeah, well I don't eat foie gras or anything with truffles, but if it's a hot seller (which the menu noted it was) you bet I'm going to tell a guest that it's very popular and then give a little description about the plate, none of that here. We had an array of waters, beers and speciality drinks at the table. My friend ordered a strawberry daiquiri and while it was too sweet for me, she really enjoyed it and was fairly strong. We started with the tuna tartare appetizer, my friends got soup and an ""Apps all around"" where you are able to choose a few different things. He chose the PB&J boneless wings, pot stickers and loaded potato skins (I think.) After our order had been placed for about 7 or 8 minutes, our server stopped by to clarify which kind of wings my friend got and said, ""Hey did you get Buffalo or BBQ wings?"" Well, he got neither, but again everything was so informal, too informal. The tuna tartare wasn't the smartest idea; not sure what I was thinking ordering raw fish at a Fridays. It wasn't bad, it was sliced tuna on top of crispy wontons with some avocado cream sauce and jalapeños, completely edible, just not great. There was too long of a gap in between our tuna appetizer and our entrees, way too long, it's Fridays, everything is frozen, there was no reason for the extended wait time at 10:45 on a Sunday night. My friends thought the boneless peanut butter and jelly wings were interesting, a little odd but that's the reason they chose them in the first place. The rest of their appetizer sampler seemed to be enjoyed for the most part. My boyfriend and I both went with the sizzling chicken and spinach dish which was advertised on the menu as being a ""healthy option"" under 500 calories. The presentation was slightly laughable; the skillet consisted of spinach that was tossed onto the plate haphazardly with a piece of chicken breast smothered in a sauce that tasted like soy sauce and sugar covering a few slices of yellow squash. The side dish was the best part of the meal, grape tomatoes with three teeny balls of mozzarella cheese. I thought that the sauce on the chicken was anything but healthy, and it had a very strange flavor, not enjoyable. The portion was very small and we left hungry. Have to keep in mind that this was a ""healthy option"" so I shouldn't be expecting a large quantity. With that being said, two coors lights, two chicken entrees and a tuna appetizer came to $50. $15 for each entree was FAR too overpriced for the quantity and quality; $9 max for that dish would be much more appropriate. To leave a restaurant hungry, $60 later with tip is a disappointment. Everything from the service to the food was underwhelming. Most likely would not come back here for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga,,,,,
