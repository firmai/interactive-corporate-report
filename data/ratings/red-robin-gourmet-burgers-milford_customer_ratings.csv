19,Andrew H.,"Cincinnati, OH",134,101,,4.0,2012-02-22,"Red Robin...I'll just sum it up like this. It's one of the best burgers I ever had. I've had Five Guys before, and it's one of the best I've had as well, but keep in mind that I've never had the pleasure to experience Quatman's, Terry's Turf Club, or any other of those burger joints I hear people going on and on about.  I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger...BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, onion straws, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. Hold the lettuce, mayo and tomato. Done medium well. It was a damn good burger though it cost me almost $10. The plus side to all this is that bottomless steak fries come with it, so it makes the $10 seem like a good deal.  It's a good little joint, with a solid product, and a good option for those looking to eat on the eastside of town or before going to the movies nearby. Service was solid, quick prompt attention with a friendly wait staff. This place is always packed at night and on the weekends.  I'll definitely be back, but not before I check out Terry's Turf Club, or Quatmans.

We came home to visit and decided, we don't have any at home so let's give them a try. Their commercials sound great; well that's about all that I can say that is good about them. I figure if it was not for the bar they would not make it, their burgers have no taste, the fries came out raw (they looked cooked but were not), my sweet potatoe fries were definitely over done, our server forgot multiple requests and then made things harder on herself by taking care of each one individually.......back and forth. This place is extremely loud, concrete floors and no acoustical ceiling, sound bounced from everywhere.

40,Tabitha W.,"Cincinnati, OH",73,401,960.0,4.0,2013-09-19,"While Red Robin's claim to fame is their gourmet burgers, I find them a bit more run-of-the-mill American chain restaurant. Which isn't always a bad thing.  After an afternoon spent at the Old West Fest, we were pretty hungry, so we decided to stop here since it was along the way.  While I wouldn't call them 'gourmet', I do give them points for their sizable burger selection.  Pretty much everything is customizable. They offer a Gardenburger or you can get the BOCA Original Vegan Burger (I opt for BOCA every time now that that's an option.)  All burgers come with unlimited fries, which is a nice bonus.   Red Robin is another restaurant that's jumped on the small plate bandwagon, a notion I love. We tried the the Yukon Chips & French Onion Dip - they were good but nothing too special.  We also got a side of Mac 'N' Cheese - that was probably the worst part of the meal. The cheese just didn't seem to be adhering to the pasta right and it just all around lacked flavor.   This location was clean and resembled every other Red Robin I've ever been to. Always a decent option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003
26,Matthew B.,"Cincinnati, OH",38,29,,2.0,2013-11-24,"We needed a quick meal before the movie.  We got seated quickly by friendly staff.  We all got burgers.  Mine was wrong - I wanted it wrapped in lettuce with onions, it was in a bun with cheese.  The napkins wrapped around the silverware had some pink stain on it like they keep them next to the pin lemonade dispenser.  My burger was not especially hot or juicy like a burger should be.  My gf and her daughter thought their ice water tasted a little funky - probably chlorine.  I didn't notice.  My burger came in a basket with wax paper while theirs came on a plastic plate.  I'm the only one who needed to cut their burger and bed-o-lettuce so by then end the paper was cut as well, and maybe I ate some of it by accident.  Also, not that I don't like sitting close to my GF, but the seats left barely enough room for two people and a purse.  Oh, and the french fries were thick, not crunchy on the outside, and didn't have much flavor.  Let's see, did I miss anything? Oh, yes, they have a double burger and a single, but they don't tell you how much meat is in each one, so you can't cost compare.  I like to know how much I am getting for my $.  Not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=40,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

The burger was good.  If you like barbecue sauce, this sauce was a little too sweet for me.  The sweet potato fries cost $1.50 extra, but I think it was worth it- especially  paired with the barbecue sauce from my burger.

7,Natashia P.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,18,1.0,1.0,2014-07-17,"The weekend of July 4th, we had some friends in from out of town and seeing as Red Robin is a fan favorite among our group, the six of us decided to stop by for lunch on Sunday. I am seriously regretting that decision after our experience that day. We were seated right away by a very inviting hostess who mentioned the dessert special for Red Robin members. Following this, our waitress (I will leave her name out) came to take our orders, but did not seem very interested to be at our table. It took an overly long time for us to get our food from the kitchen. When we got our orders, we found out why. All of our meals were lukewarm. Not one was warm, so they weren't waiting on one to be finished before bringing it to us. It most likely sat on the counter until our waitress got around to bringing it out to us. The food, despite being lukewarm, was still delicious, so I commend the kitchen. Our waitress was cordial, but not willing to do more than she must to get our service. My boyfriend asked for more fries, which we got not too long after. But when one of the other couples asked for fries and I asked for more fruit not five minutes later, it took over 30 minutes for her to bring it to us. I timed it; and during this time period, I saw our waitress in the kitchen area messing around with another server. She was placing clips in his hair and putting her hands in his hair. I watched her afterwards to see if she would wash her hands or go to the restroom where she may have washed her hands and she didn't. Disgusting! Everyone at the table was finished with our food and all of our drinks had been empty for ten minutes before our waitress finally brought the fries and fruit. She set it down and was getting ready to walk away before I spoke up and asked for drink refills for the table. To top it off, the fruit she brought me was bad. The third couple in our party was also going to ask for a refill of fries, but decided against it after she took so long. To top it off, it seemed the waitress was really rushing us out the door. She brought us our checks without asking if anyone wanted dessert. I had to stop her before she handed the receipts out to say that we all wanted to order dessert (two of us had the member cards and were getting the special deal). We ordered our dessert to go as we were concerned it would take us another hour to get out of there. And then we didn't even get a proper receipt to take with us, so there is no telling if she actually corrected the receipts or not. I was appalled at the terrible service. If we hadn't had friends visiting us, I would have found a manager that day to complain. Red Robin is a favorite among our group, but I can safely say that all six of us will think twice before coming by again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford?start=20,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.628000000000001

My son had the Ensenada Chicken Platter.  He was looking for something he liked that was also low in fat and calories and he said he will get this meal every time now. The place was mostly empty so service was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

35,Joshua S.,"Milford, OH",13,2,,1.0,2017-08-11,Never have I left anywhere more infuriated than I did tonight! Wish I could leave some scathing review of what was probably going to be some over priced steak&shake but I didn't get that opportunity and neither did my wife! After waiting for a full hour our group was seated without enough seating! My wife and I and our 9 month old daughter were left without anywhere to sit. We waited as our hostess made absolutely no valid attempt to help us find somewhere to sit. We even offered to sit away from our group. Still she left us with nothing but an attitude and no where to sit. So we left...our group who are celebrating my MOTHER IN LAWS BIRTHDAY!!! I really want to scream obscenities to the manager but I'm above the food and service my family did and could of received. You just don't work all day excited to eat somewhere after work and receive this kind of treatment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

But he kinda looked like doc Holliday with out his hat and well guns. But any way the place was hopping but they were on it.  It was clean and the food was great and timing was on point.  My burger was my own creation of onion bun. Blue cheese. Tomato lettuce onion and campfire sauce sounded weird but it so good.  Wife got the classic with an egg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
29,Cindy W.,"Cincinnati, OH",221,116,610.0,2.0,2018-01-12,"As of December/January 2018: We have attended twice in the past month, and unfortunately things have changed for this restaurant.  This is the second time that we have returned and sat in the bar area only to wait forever for fries, refills on our drinks, and our food. Our server was quite busy, as he/she was responsible to wait on the customers at the bar, make drinks for the entire restaurant, and serve our food. Last night, he had about six tables and an additional six people at the bar. He was expected to serve us all. Kudos for him for trying--but that is way too much pressure to put on him. We did not get refills of drinks nor what we needed. I was also sorely disappointed in the bathrooms. When I visited in December, they were pretty bad. When I returned in January, nothing had changed. It was very dirty. They were out of paper towels in the girls restroom. Three people told the staff and an hour later, they were still no paper towels in the bathroom. Unfortunately, the food was not cooked well. Plus, the avocado I ordered was already brown. I had to go to the kitchen to get a side of mayonnaise because my server was too busy. Bummer, for I love Red Robin! I do not think I will be back to this location. Honestly, I will be visiting Texas roadhouse next-door when I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-milford,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
