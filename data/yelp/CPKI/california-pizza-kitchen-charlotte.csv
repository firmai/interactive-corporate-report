Jordan S.,"North Charleston, SC",123,7,3,5.0,1/10/2018,"Even though lots of these reviews seem negative, I had a pleasant experience back in November when I visited.  The restaurant was completely crowded, so my party of 5 sat at the bar. Our server took a little while at first, but he was obviously very busy with bartending and such. I ordered the Berry Sangria and it was delish, one of the best sangrias I have had. For dinner, I tried their new Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti pasta, and it was just phenomenal. I am a huge mushroom fan and the past was cooked very well. While our meal was being served, the manager came over and spoke to us. She was very knowledgeable and displayed great customer service. We ended the meal with the Butter Cake and the Chocolate Souffle Cake. Both were very tasty.  I look forward to returning tomorrow afternoon for my next business trip to Charlotte!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte
Nick P.,"Richmond, VA",0,18,,1.0,10/7/2017,Totally burned and someone thought this was acceptable to deliver to their customers.  Ridiculous that I paid over $50 for burned pizzas. No idea how to show how burned these pizzas were except.  ,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte
Brantly W.,"Charlotte, NC",1,32,13,1.0,8/20/2017,"When you eat here, expect to feel as if you a bother to the employees. My friend and I ate here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and sadly I believe it will be my last visit. The host area is unorganized and unattended. After another employee got the host a few ppl ahead of got seated and then we did. Upon being seated it took several minutes for the waitress to show up. (& it was not slammed, so being busy isn't an excuse) Her demeanor and attitude was very unfriendly. Her service was poor. Meaning the amount of time it took to get our good and drinks, never once got a refill, and taking awhile to process our checks.  The only ounce of friendliness was when she dripped the checks off BC she was thinking about us tipping.  She acted like she hated being there.  And the the same attitude with the food runner.  The food itself was ok. I got the chicken wrap app as a meal and my friend got a salad. But in my opinion it's over priced for mediocre food and bad service. Do yourself a favor, save time and money and go to the food court instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte
B. R.,"Charlotte, NC",0,4,,5.0,1/6/2018,California Pizza has great food and wonderful service.

Trevor H.,"Durham, NC",183,31,44,4.0,12/20/2017,"I have been to this location twice in 2017 and I have had pleasant experiences each of the times I've eaten here.  Both times the waiter/waitresses were friendly, and for the most part attentive. Something that stood out to me and left a good impression was that I was greeted by both managers, and one of them specifically made sure I was satisfied with my experience.  All the staff that greeted me had a smile and pleasant demeanor.  The restaurant was clean including the bathroom.  Both times at this location, I have ordered the Carne Asada and was pleased that they have an option to have a wheat crust.  The pizza came out in a timely manner and was delicious.  The steak on the pizza was very tender​ and full of flavor.  The Carne Asada is my favorite pizza at CPK and I highly recommend​ it to all you carnivores reading this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte

Ronee J.,"Charlotte, NC",0,17,2,1.0,11/24/2017,Black Friday ...we were looking for a great dinner by ordering takeout...ordered 2 pizzas and a large Thai Salad.  One of the pizzas was basically raw...uncooked crust and raw veggies.

Ericka H.,"Charlotte, NC",208,4,13,1.0,12/19/2016,"Food is pretty good here, but this was not a good experience.  I picked my daughter up from school for lunch to celebrate getting into her first choice for college and thought we could order as takeout and ask if we could actually dine in so it would be ready when we got there. When we got there, we discovered that the restaurant wasn't open yet and we waited.  They were a few minutes late opening so the restaurant was completely empty.  I asked for a manager so we could see if we could dine in, since we were now starting to run low on time.  She responded by saying that take out was  for take out and that she could do it THIS time since it was slow. The tone was condescending and she informed me that they do it that way because servers depend on tips.  I told her that was why I was asking BEFORE I paid for the meal so we could tip.  It was entirely too much drama so early in the morning.  Managers need to be trained to solve problems and not create them.  Your restaurant is completely empty and you act like it's a bother to seat me for lunch, when 'm stating that I have no problem tipping.  That just makes no sense...   The simple way to handle this would have been to say, ""Sure, I can transfer your ticket to a table ticket and have one of our servers take care of you.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte

Amy R.,"Richmond, VA",0,21,4,2.0,9/5/2017,"I have a soft spot for the chicken Waldorf salad, but have had two frustrating experiences at this location with the same waiter. I felt like he was constantly trying to upsell us. When we asked for water, he was like ohh bottled water right? And when we ordered our food he started rattling off a bunch of appetizers saying you want one? He did this as he was leaving so we were constantly saying no no. Just the things we asked for. Don't add extra stuff onto our bill. Then when it was time for the check, he was nowhere to be found until he rolled up saying ""you want dessert, right?"" I realize they want you to spend more money at their establishment, but it felt like he was trying to trick us into paying for things we didn't ask for.

Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,792,2219,2.0,4/26/2015,"Errr,, ummm,,, I'm definitely struggling for words here. I'm trying to comprehend how the pioneer of the Buffalo chicken pizza is now serving uninspired,  lackluster pizzas. Every time I took a bite out of my Thai Chicken and The Works pizza, I'm a bit dumbfounded how a popular place like this can serve severely bland tasting pizzas.    The food was so blah,, we ended up playing the ""would you rather..."" game.    A: Would you rather eat pizza from CPK or Pizza Hut?    B: Pizza Hut!!    A: Would you rather eat pizza from CPK or Little Caesars?    B: Little Caesars!! Yes, it was that bad. I don't know if these guys are actually tasting their food, but whoever the head chef/cook in that establishment should definitely invest in some tastebuds.    Lowest rating would be a one star, but the extra star is for their service,,, the host seated us right away, we received our waters,, ordered our drinks and food in a timely fashion. Our server was on point and we were well taken cared of. Even my beer came frosty cold.   It's such a shame that amidst all that stellar service,, the quality of food eclipsed all their hard work. This CPK sorta did it for me, it'll probably take a bit til I step into one of these joints again.

Aaron G.,"Charlotte, NC",1,67,25,1.0,2/19/2017,"This place is a case study for what happens when the manager doesn't give a crap.  The floors, doors, glass and walls are dirty.  The greeters are inconsiderate or inept, trying to sit people looking for a quiet dinner next to tables of screaming children.  The waitstaff is clueless and left us sitting for 20+ minutes unhelped.  1/2 of the orders at the table came out lukewarm from the kitchen.  We left after waiting 10 minutes for the twice promised to-go iced tea that was never delivered.

Unfortunately, they missed the mark today. We came on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm as a party of 5. The hostess, ""Abbey"" told us it would be a 25 minute wait. As we waited, we saw other large groups get seated before us. This was infuriating to say the least. I spoke to the manager, ""Bob M"" who was only mildly apologetic and not concerned about the lack of hospitality.

Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,3.0,7/29/2013,"In general I really enjoy CPK. This visit the only thing I didn't enjoy was that the place has two entrances and the hostess had some difficulty determining who came in first (even though we were very polite when telling her that we had come in ahead of another group) they were on her list first so they got seated first. If a place has two entrances and they are getting busy, its a good idea to establish a line and stick to it. The only reason we were there was because our first choice restaurant had a 2.5 hour wait and CPK only had a 30 min wait. Anyways, once we were seated everything was good. Our server Elisabeth was great. We had the Focaccia bread and the Fried Macaroni small plate as our appetizers. The bread was good and the mac was ok. The breading on the mac was delicious the mac in itself was a bit lacking in flavor. We had three pizzas at our table - The Meat Cravers on orig crust, Jamaica Jerk Chicken thin crust, and Hawaiian BBQ. The Jamaican Jerk was spicy but very tasty! All three were really good. The flavored lemonades and teas were good. All in all, we had a good experience. Standard CPK from what we've experienced. Good food and good service and reasonably priced.

My friend and I ended up ordering children's pizzas (6 bucks for 4 microscopic pieces of mediocre pizza, yay) and the service was very average, and continued to get worse with the less money we spent.

Joshua R.,"High Point, NC",108,86,138,2.0,1/2/2016,"The California Pizza Kitchen at South Park was below average due to the less-than-good pizza.  I visited for lunch with my family and ordered the hummus appetizer before getting the salad and pizza lunch duo. The humus was good, and the spinach quinoa salad was very good. The spiced pecans and champagne vinaigrette were especially good. My issue was with the pizza. The shaved mushroom and spinach pizza was soggy and gross. I took a few bites and just couldn't eat a mush pizza. I tried a piece of the BBQ chicken pizza as well. While not soggy, the BBQ sauce was sickeningly sweet. I wouldn't have normally dropped a restaurant rating all the way to two stars since a lot of what I had was good, but the pizza was bad and it IS a pizza place after all. Good pizza isn't rocket science. Stop trying to church it up and make a good, simple product.

I was here for work so I have never been to this location before, but I have been eating at CPK since I was younger. As much as I love this place, I wish they would just come back with their Peking Duck Pizza they used to have!! This location in particular, I sat outside for lunch and thought the patio was pretty spacious for shopping mall. The view was also nicer than some of the other ones I have been to and you are staring at a parking lot. The waiter I had was very fast and friendly as well, definitely a place I would stop at if I had to get food and be in and out.  I ordered the small plate wedges salad as well as the hawaiian pizza while I was there. The small wedge salad was pretty good, I mean you can't really mess up a salad so I can't complain. The thing I love about the CPK pizzas is the crust, it is not flavorless and always really sweet. Kind of like a Kings Hawaiian roll on a pizza, which is why I make a point to order the pizza everytime I am there. When I ordered this pizza at this location, the crust did not taste like it was supposed to and I was disapointed!! My favorite part is the crust and I did not eat any of it on this visit.

So you hear pork taco and you think pulled bbq pork with all the fixings right? WRONG! I was presented with 2 of soggiest soft tacos I had ever encountered. But the soggy exterior was not the most offensive part.  I took one bite of the pork taco and thought that the server got my order wrong. The inside of the soggy taco was filled with cubes of greasy fried pork! I thought to myself 'What in the world?' Oh and if the mushy oily texture was not enough of an insult to my pallet, let me add that the entire bite was bland.  The combination of the soggy taco and cubes of greasy fried pork left me speechless and grossed out.  The server came around to see how things were going and I told him I was expecting a different experience with pork taco. He asked me if I would like something else and I told him no.

The environment was nice and the servers were very friendly.  My favorite part of the meal was probably the complimentary warm bread.  It came with olive oil and had an great crispy crust.   For lunch I got the Waldorf Salad, which was huge, and it was pretty good.  I did not have a chance to try and of their cocktails, but I am not sure if the restaurant feels like the place where I want to go to in order to enjoy some drinks.

Staff had always been wonderful and prompt and our food, amazing as expected. The only hiccup was the 1st visit with my son, he ordered a kids pizza and i ordered one of their salads, because I LOVE their salads, but instead, the server had accidentally entered in a Flatbread ""small plate"", - i let the server know, he left the flatbread on our table & let me know it was comp'd (obviously), and he'd go place the salad order rush. No biggie. The flatbread had mushrooms & spinach & since I love both I tried it and it was so good, I tracked down the server quickly & told him not to worry about ordering the salad, I was fine with the Flatbread & not to comp it. It was a simple mistake that they went out of their way to correct & worked out in my favor because I ended up with something I wouldn't have tried normally, but was so good my mom & I ordered it on our future visits lol along with avocado egg rolls (omg) and other apps.

Kristian C.,"Orlando, FL",333,41,27,3.0,9/12/2014,"Very disappointing and I didn't even eat there. My very first job was a hostess for a CPK and the people I talked to did an awful job. Once I made my selection on the prompt a girl picks up the phone and says, ""hello""....hello? I'm not calling your personal phone! How about your name and where I'm calling? Duh! Then she couldn't tell me anything about delivery, said she should though and then transferred me to the guy who would. He was equally underwhelming. I asked if they delivered and he said yes but his delivery guy is out. That was it. So I inquired further...out delivering or out for the night and then he says out for the night. Jesus what is wrong with the youth nowadays. Most seem to have no work ethic and seriously lack common sense and customer service. UPDATE: Within a business day the store manager reached out to me and apologized for my experience. He said they are currently undergoing a service training company wide. While I applaud them for this corporate wide effort this is definitely something they could do internally.

However last night I had family in from out of town and we stopped by the pizza kitchen after being told the nicer restuarants around the mall had over 2 hour waits. We were told the wait at the pizza kitchen was only 20 minutes and decided to add our name to the list. We came back 20 minutes later and were told it would be an additional 20 minutes because the current table they picked for us was still seated. Not a problem, we browsed another store and came back to be told the table was STILL occupied. We decided to have a seat and since the small waiting area was full, the hostess told us if we sat right outside they would come call us when it was ready.  After waiting a full hour from our original check in, we went back for the 4th time and the hostess told us our name was called, and when no one claimed the table they sat another party. We immediately asked why no one ever came to call us in the seating area and they simply said we usually recommend someone waits inside the restaurant. No apology, no further accommodations.  Needless to say we left and waited for the buzzer from maggianos to go off and had a MUCH more enjoyable experience.

Chad E.,"Charlotte, NC",187,2236,1436,2.0,12/30/2011,"Whatever the reason, I have typically avoided CPK whenever I see them (almost exclusively in airports).  There is just zero appeal.  But while waiting for some glasses down the way, we needed to decide on something, and other food court fare had even less appeal, so off we went. The day was a decent one, so we opted to sit on the patio.  Not a good choice.  Apparently they did not have much say in the design of the patio, as it looks like something pulled directly from a Dr. Seuss book - all sorts of crazy angles.  I am really amazed that everything does not fall directly off the table, so some unknown law of gravity must be at work.  Maybe they have the ghost of M. C. Escher on staff. To make matters worse, this little ten-person patio is way smaller than the dozens (hundreds?  thousands?) of tables inside, so if you get stuck out there, you will probably have horrible service.  If it was just us, I could blow it off as something personal - but it seemed like every table out there was constantly looking around for someone, and more than one actually got up and went inside to ask for someone to come out. As has been mentioned, the prices are pretty high.  I do not know if this is typically for CPK, as my only comparison is to the locations in an airport, but I do know that for what you get, it is not the best deal.  Made me want to hang out in the food court and try to get a few free samples from the fast food Chinese guy, hoping he would take pity on me.  Unfortunately I could probably miss a few meals, so I doubt he would give me more than seven before he told me to move along.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=40

Drew M.,"Charlotte, NC",6,34,,1.0,11/4/2013,"Normally, this restaurant has a great reputation.  In Florida, it was one of my favorite places.  Here in the Southpark location in Charlotte, it is actually really bad. The last few times I went, the service was terrible, the hostesses rude, the food was bland and skimpy on portions, and the atmosphere awful.   The very last time I went, it was so bad, that I emailed the corporate office to let them know they are being represented poorly here in charlotte, and they sent me a couple of free meal coupons. So, this past weekend, I went there to give them one last try. Upon arrival, I noticed quite a few tables out on their patio, and the day was glorious...74 and totally sunny.  Once inside at the hostess stand, I requested a table on the patio.  She told me they had ""stopped seating outside"", and it was 1:00pm??  I then said, well I guess we have to sit inside, which she then told me there was a 15-20 minute wait.  When I questioned all of this (since there were no people waiting, and the dining room was practically empty, she said they were short-staffed.   Wow!  Talk about your horrible management!  This is so sad.  I hate to see a good company go down because of horrible management.  Needless to say, I did not stay to eat, and will never return to this location again.  I do wish there was another Charlotte location in the Ballantyne area that had a different manager so they could be as wonderful as they are in other states.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=40

The head chef came out and explained all procedures in making their GF pizza to assure me that there would be no cross contamination and the manager brought my food out, explaining that he had washed his hands and not gone near gluten before serving my food.  I was extremely impressed with their customer service and dedication to providing a safe place to eat for those of us with Celiacs and gluten intolerance, unlike The Cheesecake Factory which has a GF menu but makes all the pasta in the same water, GF and regular, which defeats the purpose of a GF menu for Celiacs.   But back to the pizza!  It was the most normal tasting GF pizza I've had, it was actually doughy and wasn't brittle or super thin.  Even Tim said he couldn't tell it was GF.  I'm definitely coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=40

As typical for any place near South Park mall at lunch, the place was packed.  Fortunately, we were seated quickly and promptly waited on.  Upon pursuing the menu and not wanting pizza, I came across my selection...Carnitas Tacos.  The order arrived at the table as two flour tacos w/ not too spicy shredded pork in the middle of each taco.  Topping these tacos was salsa verde, shredded lettuce, cabbage, red onions, and cilantro.  The dish does come w/ avocado but I nixed that topping.  W/ a squeeze of lime, these tacos were pretty decent.  Great flavor and filling w/out leaving you stuffed.  The side of tortilla chips was the only part of the meal that tasted overly processed...like corn flavored Baked Lays.   All of this for $10.75 was a little pricey for two tacos and chips.  But then again, you are in SP and everything here is a little pricey.

Faith D.,"Charlotte, NC",165,1120,761,3.0,4/13/2009,"California Pizza Kitchen is conveniently located in South Park Mall. It is an ideal place to rest your feet after shopping.  I went in the late afternoon and had prompt service. The server was attentive, but seemed distracted by multi-tasking.  I ordered the goat cheese and rosted red pepper pizza. It was very flavorful! My husband ordered the Mediterranean salad and it was good too.  I tend to enjoy non-chain restaurants more than chains, but California Pizza Kitchen did the trick. Like I mentioned before, it's a great way to rest and eat after walking around the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=60
Dave E.,"Charlotte, NC",8,28,48,3.0,9/14/2013,"Guess there's a reason it's not called the California Chicken/Pasta Kitchen. Ordered a chicken pasta dish and asked if they offered a half portion option... the answer was unfortunately ""No."" Full order came, but only 5 to 6 thumb size pieces of meat. No where near enough for a $12+ meal. Server responded by bringing over the manager; he explained how the meal was prepared, but did agree to have some extra chicken grilled up and brought over at no charge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=60
Anthony Y.,"Huntersville, NC",47,34,1,2.0,7/15/2013,"Slow service. Management lacks leadership. Other than that, the food is on par with the high quality standards of all the other CPK stores.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=60

Christopher S.,"Annapolis, MD",45,394,22,3.0,3/10/2010,Normally a very good place to dine. I have noticed a change in their ingredients which has diminished the quality they are known. for. The Sicilian Pizza sausage has been changed to a different grade and is not nearly as good as in the past. The other night I had the Thai Pasta with chicken. Where's the chicken? The portion of chicken was extraordinarily small. I was very disappointed.  The service was excellent as usual.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=60
Mike H.,"Charlotte, NC",0,21,,2.0,3/11/2013,"The food is delicious but the service has never been good.  One night, my date (who is lactose intolerant) asked for a salad sans cheese. The salad had to go back three times before they got it right. My pizza was cold before my date could even eat. Another night I received a beer with a huge chunk of slushy ice in it. This was after clarifying our order twice, as the waiters don't like to write things down.  My verdict: if you want CPK, get takeout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=60
Alisa N.,"San Antonio, TX",56,58,72,3.0,1/9/2012,I've been to California Pizza Kitchen in TX and GA and usually I have a good meal however I wanted pasta this time and the server convinced me that the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine was delicious. Well the sauce and spinach fettuccine was great but the chicken was dry and left a lot to be desired.  Next time I will stick with real tequila and a pizza please!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=60
Charisse H.,"Charlotte, NC",0,1,,1.0,7/19/2014,"Been to this location plenty of times and never had a complaint but after today, I may never return.  The appetizers we ordered came promptly. However, the spinach artichoke dip was room temperature instead of hot. After flagging down the waiter (since he never checked in on us) he quickly got it heated. Then the main course of barbecue chicken pizza came. It tasted quite great.  While talking with my company, the waiter came, and instead of refilling my drink that had been empty for quite some time, he took my lat piece of pizza and the spinach artichoke dip away without asking if I was finished or if I wanted a box! (Which I did as I was still eating the pizza and planned on boxing the dip).  He then finally refilled my drink- halfway. That was the cherry on top-- after the whole mess of a night he only refilled my drink half way even though he had an entire pitcher at his disposal.  I will be avoiding a return to this location due to this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte?start=60
