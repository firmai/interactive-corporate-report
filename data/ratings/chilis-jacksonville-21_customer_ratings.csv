26,Jim H.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,22,,1.0,2013-04-13,"Not the place to go if you want to have a conversation with anyone at your table. The place has terrible acoustics, and is ridiculously loud. The drinks (even the beer) seemed watered down, and the beer mugs are smaller than average. When one of our party told her the margarita was awful, she whined ""You didn't like it?"" She still charged for it, but had such a rotten disposition it was easier just to pay for it than to argue with her. And the food is just adequate at best. Not a place I'd return or recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=40,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

17,Cathrine C.,"Newport News, VA",389,343,506.0,4.0,2014-03-20,"DELISH!!! Chili's has definitely stepped up their game in the sit-down restaurant category.  I went to dinner here with my coworker for her 20th bday (which we mentioned to 2 different workers, but went unacknowleded). The menu is HUGE so a lot of page turning...over and over and over again. My coworker and I finally settled for the 2 for $20 dinner. We got our chips and salsa appetizer about 5 minutes later and they were so good! The chips were super crispy and warm and the salsa was the right amount of spiciness. As we were eating we toyed around with the little black tv machines on the table. They are definitely pretty neat, but I wouldn't pay 99¢ to play games on there. I did like that you could order dessert and pay your check on there with a card. And you could even split the check up to 3 times - sweeet! About 5min after that, we were approached by by this awesome balloon guy (his name is Joe) and asked if we had any requests. My coworker said it was her birthday and shed like a turtle. He did that and made me a cat one, and boy were they do cute. We felt bad that we didn't have money to tip him :/ Anyways, our food came in about 15min later and it was so great! I got the chicken crispers with buffalo sauce and my coworker got the same with no sauce mixed in. We only ate about half because we munched through so many chips and salsa.  The server we had was kinda slow on service but he was very nice. We had a great experience just because of how good the food was (and Joe was cool too!). Definitely going to go back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004

It was one in the afternoon. It took a minute to be seated.  The lunch menu offers soup/salad and half a sandwich.  I chose a house salad and half turkey sandwich.  I requested the bread not be toasted, the server wanted to know if I wanted my cheese melted....I had to let her know if I wanted a cold sandwich.  (It got a little complicated) The salad was ok, the bread (wheat) on my sandwich was a little hard.  It tasted ok, but I did not eat most of the bread.  The server let us know that we should use the device on our table to pay by plastic or pay her with cash. This was my first experience with the ""new"" way of paying.  It calculates the tip for you and you can slide the scale to the percentage that you are comfortable with.  The server sat in the booth with me to explain the device and to clear the table.  (I was not crazy about that)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

I will say if you order the nachos be prepared they're not like any other nachos you would expect they did have a lot of seasoning which tasted good but ultimately way too salty also they had no lettuce no tomato nothing but cheese and chicken on tortillas cut into triangles...also the little touch screen thing at the table that you can pay your check on is useful except you can order anything on it except for drink refills or dessert...very frustrating! go at your own risk,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

It's funny that I live on this side of the city and never went to this chili. The interior has changed a lot from what I remember. It looks much cleaner and more modern. Of course, we had to wait about 15 minutes before they could find us a table. I love how they have the tablets on each table. You can scroll through each menu item and see how the foods look like for the items that do not have pictures in the menu. I came here with my future father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her daughter for dinner. We came for the family bundle deal for $30 which includes an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 kids entrees, and a shared dessert. Very great deal for a family. We got the Fresh Guacamole Chips and Salsa, Margarita Grilled Chicken with skillet mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli, 1/2 rack of ribs with fries, 2 grilled chicken kids meal. The chips and salsa was good. The chips are thinner than what I remember in the past. The guacamole was fresh and tasted just right.  The Margarita Grilled Chicken was tender, very moist, and my sister-in-law made a point that it looked and tasted like ""fake"" chicken. I can see and taste by what she meant. It was kind of awkward to see chicken breast being sliced to cleanly and rarely any chicken mean streaks that you usually see. I still ate it anyways as I was really hungry. The skillet mashed potatoes was good and the steamed broccoli was cooked just right, not so soggy and not so raw. The best part was the Molten Chocolate Cake. Love the ice cream in the choco cake method. LOL. Always my favorite. You can never mess up on that dessert. Very cold and warm at the same time.

6,Ashton J.,"Jacksonville, FL",366,68,178.0,5.0,2017-01-09,"I have always had great service here! I love that there is a vegan option on the $22 for 2 and the $35 for for 2. This option being the fajita with no butter, no cheese, no meat, instead add broccoli and beans to the already existing onions and bell peppers. This comes with a little scoop of guacamole and remember to request for corn tortillas instead of flour. DElicious!!! I love the layout of this Chili's!!! It has a bar section, and different areas that are either focused toward smaller groups/couples or large groups/parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
9,Kinsley V.,"Fruit Cove, FL",55,166,21.0,4.0,2017-03-05,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop in for a quick causal dinner last night and weren't disappointed. We almost didn't walk in when we saw how many people were waiting to be seated but I'm glad we did because we were seated within 10 minutes of walking in. Our server was friendly and attentive and we never had to wait long on anything. We ordered chips and the loaded queso to start off and the queso was divine! We both enjoyed our entrees, my steak was cooked just right and his fajitas looked delicious. They also have great bar specials all day everyday. 2 for 1 select beers, and house margaritas! If you are looking for something that's a step up from your regular margarita, I recommend their famous presidente margarita! Overall, this is a great casual place to grab lunch or dinner right off of bustling San Jose Blvd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
16,Joe C.,"Union, SC",36,8,,4.0,2017-03-08,I really enjoyed my visit to this location not only for the excellent food but for the outstanding service that I received. I was fully informed on all of the specials when I was seated and had a really great rapport with the waiter that was at our table. If you are going to Chili's be sure to check out the fajitas fully loaded they are awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
32,Ursula W.,"Sanford, FL",0,18,,5.0,2017-03-27,"Went to see friends,we decided to go with Chili's order to go. I live in Lake Mary, we always go to that Chili's but there curbside was horrid, something I will never do again. However at this location it was awesome! I went to there order on line, after I placed the order it kept telling me they did not have this or that? So I called Andrew was amazing! He took my order over the phone, went over everything with me two times to make sure it was right. I got there about 20 minutes later to get my food, I wish I remembered the wonderful woman's name who brought me the food also got Andrew for me so I could thank him. The food was fantastic, order was all there and correct,  super hot. Our friend's  live about 11 minutes from this location, even though there were super busy, they made me feel really welcomed, also Andrew took the time to quickly come see me so I could thank him for all his help. I love our Chili's in Lake Mary, but not so much there curb side, but this location they have new fans. My friends had never gone, nor did they know they offered this service, they loved how easy it was, also how great the food was. We have now found another great Chili's to go to when we are in town again. Thank you so much Andrew for turing this curbside doubter into a fan!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

19,Scott L.,"Saint Johns, FL",4,25,9.0,2.0,2017-05-20,"Good food at a great price.  Too bad we ended up with a waiter who didn't speak.  No greeting, he never asked about our food, no refills of drinks, nothing.   A great night out ruined by a waiter who was too good to serve us.   Maybe he will get fired and our next experience will he better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

Service was very slow and the waitress left for long periods at a time and when we got our food 2 of my friends had a piece of hair in their food. It's a clean place but would not recommend for the lack of service and hair in food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

2,Dona P.,"Jacksonville, FL",19,12,,1.0,2017-11-20,"Waited a full 5 minutes at the door before anyone even greeted me. It was not busy at all. When I finally was acknowledged and seated it was another full 5 minutes before I even saw a server. He acknowledged me and said he'd be with me shortly as he went to take the order of the table next to me. They were there when I got there and he was just getting to them to take their drink order! Again, it was not busy at all! At that point I decided this was going to take way too long for lunch and left. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
1,Linda V.,"Jacksonville, FL",64,310,790.0,3.0,2017-11-28,"Since we had this $25 gift card we came to this Chili's which has been here forever! 1st time on a Friday night and we're told would be a 45 min. wait. I looked around and a huge room of tables was roped off.. not in service, we left. We came back on a Tuesday and were seated on the side where it was pretty packed with customers and only 3 servers.  Took about 10 min. to give our order. Then we waited... I got up to look around and the restaurant was not busy.. seemed two places on the sides had the customers... very few any where else including the bar.  As I was looking the hostess asked could she help me and asked if we ordered drinks, I said a couple of beers. She said she look into getting them so I said how about some chips to for our wait.. she said sure! When they came, they looked wet! They were covered in grease so we only ate a few, normally I'd send back but since free we just didn't eat them! Our order came 25 min. later and it was warm..not hot! It looked to be plenty of meat but some was grisly; I had to spit it out. The extras were plentiful and tasty-grilled onion, red/gr. peppers, not warm black bean soup, rice, sour cream, guat, tomatoes, shredded cheese.  After we got our bill they charged us for the greasy chips! I asked hostess about it and she said she'd call her manager, he came, I explained and he took them off the bill. In general the staff was friendly but I think they are understaffed so service is slow and food is only warm! I hope I don't get anymore gift cards for Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
