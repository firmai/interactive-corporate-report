It looks like a nice place for kids to eat with all the statues of the bird, but the food left a lot to be desired. I had the mac and cheese with rib tips and my sister had the shrimp tacos. The shrimp tacos were very good. The shrimp were grilled to perfection and the cabbage added a nice crunch and the avocado mellowed every thing out. Now my mac and cheese on the other hand, I give 3 thumbs down. It was literally boiled pasta with no butter, milk or cheese with a drizzle of cheese like substance on top. I brought this to the waiters attention and he told me that that's how they make their mac and cheese. Smh. I returned the fail that they call mac and cheese and got shrimp tacos instead.

32,John H.,"Charlotte, NC",265,1284,687.0,3.0,2012-11-30,"Menu with a ton of different burgers?  Yes, please!  Unfortunately for Red Robin, it's a chain... so you can get your burger from one state to the next.  The university location seems to be fairly slow (not busy) but our server was nice enough.  We were there during peak lunch time and it was barely full.  I guess it's hard to get away from this place without dropping $12-15 dollars for lunch.  Granted it's a pretty hearty meal, but a bit expensive for lunch. The dining room is kept clean and there is plenty of nick-knacks on the walls to look at to kill the time. One thing that they have going for them is their ""special"" Red Robin seasoning, which unfortunately on my last trip was a bit solidified in the container which leads me to believe how long it has been sitting there or how NOT often they refill or keep that seasoning at it's best.  Mostly salt, but still. If you are looking for a quick lunch... I wouldn't recommend this place since it was pretty relaxed.  I could see myself getting easily annoyed if I was trying to get somewhere since our server seemed to have fair command over the section, but it felt like the getting the checks took forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte?start=20,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003
34,Nathan W.,"Corvallis, OR",10,14,,4.0,2013-05-07,"Good grief, people, it's a chain restaurant. You pretty much know what you're going to get when you come here: decent food, plenty of it, at a reasonable price. If you go in expecting the best food you've ever had, you're gonna have a bad time. Recognize that this place calls itself ""Red Robin Gourmet Burgers"" for two reasons: 90% of the people who eat here equate ""big and messy with lots of stuff on it"" with ""good burger,"" and ""Red Robin Really Big and Messy Burgers That Taste Pretty Ok"" didn't test as well with focus groups.  If you want a really good burger, go to a specialty burger joint that's not a chain. If you want a big burger loaded with a lot of flavorful things like bacon, jalapenos, avocado, and barbecue sauce, accompanied by a ton of fries and a frosty adult beverage, Red Robin would be a good choice.  Is it truly gourmet? Not hardly. Is it gourmet enough for most Americans? Definitely.  Anyway, I went to this location while in town on business. Nothing that I wasn't expecting, and just what I was looking for: a decent burger, some fries, and a frosty adult beverage on the company's dime. Service wasn't the best I've ever had but was perfectly acceptable, the food was plentiful and tasty, the beer was cold, and the company paid for it. Nothing to complain about.

12,Shakeela M.,"Monroe, NC",11,9,3.0,5.0,2016-12-27,I went to lunch by myself it was a great. I had a chicken sandwich with the bottomless steak fries. My server was great.

6,Tiffany C.,"Monroe, NC",0,19,7.0,5.0,2017-02-01,Shasta was absolutely brilliant.  She knew exactly what we needed for dietary needs and assisted in ordering them. She kept up on drinks and food. Definitely deserves a pay raise.  The bathroom could use some attention. One out of three sinks worked and the locks on the stalls were broken.  Other than that the food was good. Service was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006
16,Vanesa S.,"Charleston, SC",0,1,,5.0,2017-03-01,"Went there today for a bite to eat before driving home 3 1/2 hours. We were instantly greeted and the hostess even engaged in a bit of conversation. We were seated and our server didn't take long to arrive. I'm not sure of his name but he was very efficient and polite! Our food didn't take long to arrive and it was hot and fresh and they even remember to put no tomatoes. The little Ziosks on the table were a bit confusing when I wanted to pay in cash but use my Robins card for points. However the server showed me exactly how to use it. If I'm ever in the Charlotte area again, I will definitely be visiting this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006
13,Wendy A.,"Charlotte, NC",8,7,,1.0,2017-03-15,"The worse experience I have ever had... Order was wrong twice, drink came with flat soda, wedge salad had brown lettuce, and fries were cold both times they were brought with my meal (never asked or given refills). When all of this was disclosed to the manager, his ONLY reply was ""Well, thanks for being patient"". Charged for grilled onions that were left off of my burger and when I informed the waitress and told her I did not want them any longer, she stated OK yet proceeded to bring them in a condiment cup anyways (probably in order to keep the charge on my bill). The bartender was MIA most of the time, server not very present as well, not to mention I had to seat myself when I came in! I have been to the Northlake location, and several others due to my traveling career however this has to be the worse one out of them all...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005
10,Kyle B.,"Charlotte, NC",9,55,94.0,3.0,2017-04-02,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon. EXCELLENT service by the hostess(don't remember her name) Extremely friendly and kind. Sydney was our waitress. She was friendly and knowledgeable. As we spoke to her we realized that she was the bartender and also serving tables. I remember coming last time and they would use their employees in this way. As we observed her activity at the bar increased where she had to make everyone's drinks. But in doing that her attention to our table became less and less. To the point where we no longer were given refills and the bottomless steak fries were not replenished. It's not Sydney's fault, I just wish Red Robin would use their employees in a more suitable way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006
15,Teresa M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,2.0,1.0,2017-05-06,"ZERO STAR REVIEW... SLOW delivery!! I ordered from here and it was supposed to be a 40-45 minute wait for delivery, which I thought was reasonable. Well, they kept changing the delivery time. I cancelled my order (for 5 people!) when it hit a 2.5 hour delivery time. When I called to cancel, they didn't even apologize!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006
4,Sheila E.,"Charlotte, NC",7,20,54.0,4.0,2017-05-17,"You can't go wrong with Red Robin! My family comes here a few times a month and the staff does remember us, which is great. One waitress who no longer works there knew my parents' order by heart, which they loved and now another waitress is trying to do the same thing. :) Who can beat bottomless fries? We always ask for them to bring some before the food comes since they are so yummy. I love getting them with buzzard wing sauce and ranch dipping sauce and covering them with that special spice they have on the table. My mom gets the side salad, which is also unlimited and they bring that before the food also by request. My favorite entrees are the Royal Red Robin (burger with an egg over easy on top and bacon, which I get on the side and take home for my dog) and the Crispy Chicken sandwich. I ordered the adult chicken tenders and fries and the Tavern Double one time each and I liked them both also, but not enough to choose over my favorite entrees. I got the macaroni and cheese as an additional side once, but it was very filling (it was bottomless and I still couldn't even finish half) and I'd never choose it over the fries.  I ordered the Buzz Tavern Double once and I hated it. It's a double cheeseburger with special spicy sauce and mac and cheese in between the patties. It sounds good in theory, but I don't recommend it! My dad said the same about the smoky tavern double.  Make sure to join their loyalty club because you get a free burger during your birthday month, a free entree after 10 meals purchased and coupons every week. We've gotten coupons for free appetizers before and we tried the fried pickles and the onion rings. Neither were anything special and we never ordered them again. Besides, who needs apps with bottomless fries? I'm not a big dessert person, but I ordered the birthday cake milkshake once and it was just ok. My sister likes the Cookie Magic shake. The other desserts sound good, but I've always gorged myself on too many fries to want to order them.  Red Robin is yummy, comforting and family friendly, so you have nothing to lose by stopping by when you can!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006

2,Stephalie C.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",165,10,3.0,1.0,2017-08-27,I live a walking distance from this location. Which i was excited about this when i first moved it. But unfortunately i never get good service here. There is always an issue! I order online as they suggest to save time. I give them 25 mins before i arrive to sit in there 15 mins with out getting acknowledged by anyone. I had to walk to their kitchen employee line to get someones attention.  They compensate my food but the food is COLD ! The i try ordering over the phone giving them yet another chance and the lady was rude and hung up on me.  Dinning in the service is okay. Just be careful with your time when ordering online and over the phone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005
7,Rose Z.,"Ayden, NC",0,19,,1.0,2017-10-05,I have been to many Red Robins and this is the  worst one. The servers stand around talking as the manager watching  this behavior and allows it. The service is slow and no attention to detail or customer service. You wait over ten minutes for food and drink refills. They advertise unlimited refills good luck getting them. We have been here over four times before I am leaving this review. Things have not changed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
0,Tommy M.,"Charlotte, NC",6,17,,4.0,2017-12-14,"I've been back a couple of times since my last review, and just a few weeks ago I ate here with my sister and brother-in-law, as they both enjoy this chain. I don't go here if it's just me, but I don't mind meeting others here since it's convenient and it's not that bad. My last time was probably the most enjoyable. Granted, it might have been because I was there with my sister and her husband, but I felt like the food was better, too. I don't think I'll ever like this location as much as the one in Greensboro; when I'd eat there, I remember thinking the original gourmet burger was the bomb, whereas here it's just really good. I wanted to revise my original review, though, because I feel like this is closer to four stars now. Maybe not a solid four stars. But close. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-charlotte,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

Sadly both of our burgers were overdone to the point that any lover of a juicy medium burger would be turned off.
