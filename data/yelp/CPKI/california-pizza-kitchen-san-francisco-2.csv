Sheril P.,"Livermore, CA",2,20,5,2.0,11/24/2017,"TERRIBLE service!!!!  We were a party of 10 and the pastas came out first.  The server tells us that the pizzas will come out later because it takes longer.  45 minutes later, our pizzas aren't out yet and the server said it's because everyone likes pizza and it's more popular?!?!  What's the name of the restaurant?????  Pizzas came 50 minutes after our pastas and the server didn't offer us any cheese or pepper.  I've never heard that excuse at any other California Pizza Kitchen - ever!!  I will never come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=20

When I entered I got a nice spot in a corner, perfect for me to eat alone and to sit back and relax. The waiter was very very friendly! I got my cherry coke (so nice they have it here) and a California pizza. It tasted perfect.  One thing I noticed.. Staff were walking around but also sitting at tables. I even saw a chef walking around in the restaurant with his phone.. Ehm.. Is it just me or is this normal?

Alison C.,"San Francisco, CA",477,211,683,5.0,9/29/2016,"Sorry not sorry, CPK is delicious!  I'm the Whole Foods, kale salad type but sometimes you just need some chain pizza to hit the spot.  This location is huge, you never have to wait for a table during lunch. The service is spot on and I like all the different types of seating. Booths! Large long tables! Banquettes! They got you. We even came here with a little baby plus stroller and they sat us perfectly at a table with plenty of room.  I always have my girlfriend that loves CPK order. She is the expert! Today we had Thai pizza (so culturally wrong but tastes so right!) and the Italian chopped salad. Add salami and it's an Italian dish at CPK. We also had giant diet cokes and they hit the spot.  It looks like they're pushing all kinds of new cocktails, wine cocktails, flights...I like your style CPK and next time I'm having a bad day you'll be my first stop to get day drunk!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=20

Marcus H.,"Napa, CA",197,2,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Kudos go out to our local California Pizza Kitchen, or CPK if you prefer.  For those who don't know, CPK is a kitchen that serves pizza. That doesn't keep them though for trying new things. Case in point, they went out on a limb and tried their hand at pasta; specifically Mac & Cheese tonight.  Now, normally Mac & Cheese is a dish best made by a college student on a budget completely out of their mind on a cocktail of weed from last night and caffiene as part of studying for exams tomorrow.  Of course one can't hold CPK to those impossibly high standards, and they did a fine job. They only misunderstood that they needed to cook the mac and cheese, or that it's best served hot (or at least warm). They also tried cooking other pasta- a pesto penne. Sure they misunderstood the italian term al dente to mean ""hard, crunchy pasta served cold"", but cooking non-pizza is hard! Not to half-way do anything, they are also experimenting with serving liquor.  I appreciated our server's dedication to learning how to serve liquor and how to pour fluids from one container into a glass like a human would at the bar, with such dedication I couldn't crush his dreams of learning how to socialize at a bar like a real boy. I realized that my waving for attention was both selfish and in vain, so I escorted myself to the front desk to request my own bill to pay and leave. Seeing places like CPK try and live beyond their station is refreshing in our modern climate of settling for ""only doing the things you're skilled enough to do"", no longer will America be held back my the limitations of things like competence! God Bless you CPK! I await the day you decide to try your culinary skills at other advanced foods such as microwave oatmeal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=20

Sonny W.,"Fremont, CA",19,375,189,2.0,1/25/2017,"Came here to feed the kiddos as we parents had a dinner event. We ordered strictly from the kid menu. Pizza was okay (it is in their name so it better be!). However, we made the mistake of ordering some fusilli pasta with meat sauce. Seriously, it was leftovers. It did not feel hot enough and the sauce was spotty, dry, with chunks of meat. Nothing appealing. In fact we send it back to get reheated but that clearly didn't improve it (only made it edibly hot but now ever-more dry). So, stay away.  Staff service was good but food and service comes together...

Meanwhile the manager is just sipping on a soda behind the bar, I go to the front to pay because it's taking forever and the host makes me wait again.

James S.,"Houston, TX",171,232,46,3.0,12/29/2017,"This is your standard CPK chain restaurant. The space is quite spacious, with ample seating, and a large menu. I'm a big fan of their pizzas since they have something for everybody, and the quality is good and the price is affordable. If you are looking for a super thin crispy pizza, their crispy thin crust is hard to beat. A popular appetizer would be the spinach and artichoke dip. I stopped by here twice after a long hiatus from the chain. First time was amazing, with great food and service. Food came out piping hot, and the flavors were solid. Service was attentive and friendly. Second time, not so much. This was primarily because of the poor service, that ended up trickling down into later parts of the experience, e.g. slow/no drink refills, no table bread, asked for a substitution, and waiter only got it half right. Overall 4 stars, plus or minus 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2
Gabrielle C.,"Oakland, CA",9,12,,2.0,12/29/2017,"Initially my favorite CPK spot is in Emeryville, on Bay Street. Ate here with my family before seeing Aladdin.  Ordered the Cream Pesto Penne. It was delicious but tasted a little off. I also got a cucumber mint lemonade which I loved. One or both of those foods did not agree with my stomach. After I was done eating, I suddenly felt cramps in my stomach. We had to walk 5 blocks to the Orpheum theater, and I could most definitely not make it. We had to drive and while I was in the car, I was certain I was gonna throw up. I didn't. I also thought I was gonna get super sick during the show, out of both ends. Luckily I had medication that helped a lot. Never thought I would get food poisoning from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2
Kay H.,"San Francisco, CA",123,92,57,3.0,12/24/2017,"My favorite dish would be the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine dish and it's horrible when they cant get it right.  I usually take all my CPK orders to-go, because the restaurant smells too much like floor chemicals.  The last time I ordered CPK, there was a thin film of oil on top of all the pasta dishes, which meant that the container wasn't the right one for the steaming hot pasta dish. I can't entirely penalize the restaurant because of packaging, but because CPK is a chain restaurant, I'd think they have a team of executives at HQ that come up with packaging details.  This place is barely packed on the weekdays and is spacious and somewhat clean. It is located right next to Office Depot tucked away on 3rd street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",394,752,959,3.0,12/15/2017,"Surprisingly there aren't a lot of pizza options along Market Street, especially around the Westfield Mall area. We were craving pizza one day and decided to try CPK out, as I have only been to one other CPK location previously.  We arrived at around 2:30 pm, and the entire restaurant was dead. There was nobody at the hostess station to greet us, but a waiter told us to sit anywhere we wanted. Because it was before 4 pm, we were able to take advantage of the lunch special. We each got one of the specialty pizzas paired along with either soup/salad.  Pizza was good, even better than the frozen ones you find at your local supermarket frozen aisle. The caesar salad was a bit disappointing, not much flavor and the lettuce didn't taste very fresh.  Service was attentive, though it took our waiter forever to get us our check. Not the best pizza place by any means in San Francisco, but if you got a group gathering or celebration, CPK is one of the few pizza joints in Downtown SF that can cater to your needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2
Ami I.,"New York, NY",76,57,84,3.0,1/6/2018,"Typical CPK, although I mistakenly expected a better version in California than the ones on the East coast. Overall, though, this was a totally satisfactory and affordable meal. We had the  flatbread, the shrimp scampi pizza, the banh mi bowl, the shrimp lettuce wraps, and the arugula asparagus salad. The pizza and the bowl were definitely the highlights, but I'd stay way from the flatbread, which was incredibly dry.  Also, great vegan options on the menu, from pizza to salads to soups, a vegan can actually get a great meal here.  Our waitress was very attentive and nice, although she did forget to bring out one dish, which we never ended up getting.  Still, a classic and enjoyable CPK dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2

It's my favorite dish here, but not sure why they microwaved the dumplings. The skin was so dry and chewy.  Lettuce wrap's lettuce wasn't that fresh. The only good dish was jambalaya.  The service here was ok, very slow, looked like they were short on staff, but our waiter was friendly.

Melissa L.,"Silicon Valley, CA",193,285,336,4.0,9/19/2017,"This place is like any other CPK which is great because there's consistency in the chain. My favorite thing to get lately are the power bowls. Better than the plain salad and to be honest feels healthier because there's dark leafy greens and grains.  I got the Santa Fe power bowl (pictured) which is super tasty. Love the green cilantro lime whatever it is dressing. Love that it comes with plenty of avocados, farro, beans, corn, red cabbage, lime chicken....basically a bunch of stuff.  I normally wouldn't eat here in SF when there's plenty of other great eats in SF but I passed right by and had a gift card so thought...why not??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2

I got an arugula salad to start that was average. The real winner was the spaghetti bolognese (added mushrooms) - one of the best pasta dishes I've had in awhile. Great flavor! Really hit the spot. It was a large entree so if you're not that hungry, beware you will have leftovers. The cherry on top was the pumpkin cheesecake, a seasonal dessert with ginger crust and praline sauce. OMG so good! My dining companion and I agreed it was better than pumpkin pie and we frantically checked to see if we have a CPK in Indiana - no luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2
Elena N.,"San Francisco, CA",1408,2429,10582,3.0,7/7/2017,"A couple of my coworkers ordered lunch from CPK last Friday, June 30th. I had picked another restaurant for my office lunch, but they were nice enough to share. Our delivery order arrived around 12 noon via Caviar. *Charred Shishito Peppers: East Asian shishito peppers pan-sautéed with soy, garlic, and red chili, Calories 220, Contains soy ($7.49) *Spinach Artichoke Dip: Served hot with housemade blue and white corn tortilla chips, Calories 930, Contains eggs, milk, soy, and wheat, May contain crustacean shellfish, fish, peanuts, and tree nuts ($11.99) *California Club Pizza: Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken, and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with wild arugula, fresh torn basil, and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo, Calories 1320, Contains eggs, milk, soy, and wheat, no avocado, Substitute with Wheat Whole Grain Crust: Calories 25 ($15.99) As much as I like knowing how many calories are in the dishes I eat, I kind of think ignorance is bliss. That way, I don't feel so much like a fat a$$! But getting past the calories listed, I actually enjoyed the wheat crust on the pizza. And the salad to put on top of it. My coworker didn't use all the greens since they provided them on the side. I ended up grabbing a bunch of her leftover greens to eat with my slice of pizza. I adore shishito peppers, so they were good. Nice char and seasoned well. I found the spinach artichoke dip a little bland. Wanted to add salt and pepper to give it more flavor. I haven't to a CPK in years. Probably the last time was in Emeryville about five years ago? It was nice revisiting as I used to go to CPK a lot back in college. (There was one close to my university.) For a chain restaurant, their pizzas are still pretty good. Especially that wheat crust.

Amir A.,"Sacramento, CA",9,44,118,2.0,12/12/2017,"We dropped by here for a quick bite outside of our hotel. This was our third attempt at a CA Pizza Kitchen. To be quite frank- we were unimpressed. The main reason we came here was to feed our toddler some cheese pizza and though he was hungry, it only took one bite from the pizza to destroy his appetite. The pizzas here are NOT great, don't come here expecting it to be what it advertises itself as- a pizza kitchen. Rather, come for the drinks, salads and maybe, possibly the pastas (?).

Jonathan R.,"Concord, CA",257,886,1047,3.0,12/8/2016,"Once again, my best friend and I were burdened with the task of finding dinner in San Francisco, a city that is a melting pot of unique cuisine. The first place we found had a 45-minute wait that we just could not do. The second place we looked at was over $30.00 a plate, which was out of our budget tonight. Right before settling on Denny's, Mel's, or god forbid, McDonald's, we came across CPK.  I love the California Pizza Kitchen, and she has never been, so this was the perfect place to be. The place was pretty empty, but there was also no host at the front. Instead, the bartender ALL the way in the back made his way to the front just to seat us. We were seated right next to the exit, which on a very cold and rainy night, was not ideal. Every time the door opened, we were hit with frigid air.  We were hungry so we knew we wanted an appetizer; however, we did not want to spend $12.00 on one, so we went with the hummus starter. The plate comes with six pieces of flat bread, and a small dish of hummus topped with slice tomatoes in the middle. Both the bread and hummus was good, and definitely worth the price.  We ordered the The Works with no black olives. The pizza came out, and it looked beautiful. Not Victoria's Secret beautiful, but more like Picasso beautiful; it's unperfect and unique. It's all about the flavors though, and the flavor train was definitely present. The best part of the pie for me was the sausage. The sausage alone carries so much of the flavor that I could just eat that alone.  We ordered dessert, and like the appetizers we went for the cheapest one possible. It was a salted caramel pudding, with homemade whipped cream, and a cookie crust on the bottom. The whole thing was served in a little jar. It was small, tasted delicious, and in another word: Perfect.  The friendliest waiter of the evening wasn't even our waiter. His name is Jon, and he started a conversation with us because of our Nightmare before Christmas attire. He was incredibly sweet, fun, and I'm kind of sad he wasn't our waiter. Our waiter was fine though, and the manager of the place had a bit of a weird vibe to him. He took our check with money and we thought he was going to close us out. Instead, he hands the check to our waiter, who was just about to take care of another table. So, there was not point to what he did.  On the check there is an extra fee about a SF health care tax, or something like that. It's not a huge amount, however, it wasn't very pleasant to see either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2
Carla L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",59,18,52,2.0,7/10/2017,"This is based on our experience on 7/2/17.  We came in for early dinner & just wanted something light. It wasn't very busy or crowded when we came. My family & I ordered 4 pizzas for everyone to share. We ordered the Sicilian, Margherita, Roasted artichoke/Spinach & California Club pizzas.  It didn't take too long for our order to come- we waited for probably about 20 or so minutes. However, to our disappointment, our pizzas came cold & not hot at all.  It was as if they had been ready for some time, but were not served to us right away, as food should be served at any restaurant. We immediately notified the waitress who brought them out & she looked at us with disbelief.  She said ""Hmm that's weird... it's probably because we're a little understaffed. Well I can have those reheated for you...""  Being understaffed shouldn't be an excuse as to why you're serving cold food to your customers.  The California Club pizza consisted of a salad on top of a pizza, which is understandable for why it is not served hot. The others, however, should've not been served cold. When they were brought back, the waitress seemed to have an attitude & said ""Make space for me.""  The pizzas were all pretty good, but it was very disappointing that they weren't served hot. Some of them were hard/over cooked after they reheated them...  It makes me wonder if we were even served freshly made-to-order pizza... Additionally, our original waiter seemed to disappear & did not check on us until later on, when we were about halfway done & to give us our check.

They did it again, CPK style: excellent food and service, to make up for their terrible Emeryville sister location it seemed to us.

Came here on NYE and service was SO S.L.O.W.W.W.W.W.W.. Our waiter clearly hates/hated his job, barely looking at us while he took our order and acting ridiculously annoyed at our questions. It took a good thirty minutes for our food to come, and another ten for our drinks. Speaking of, the sangrias are absolutely delicious!!  We all split a Spicy Fennel Sausage Flatbread for appetizer. For $6, it's a pretty good deal. The flatbread was super crispy. I ordered a half-order of Moroccan Chicken Salad ($11). I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken, but I did like the butternut squash, cranberries, and beets. SO pricey though. My friends ordered the California Cobb Pizza, BBQ Chicken Salad, and Shrimp Scampi Fettucini (part of the Lite menu). They said the fettucini was disappointing, with only ~3 pieces of shrimp.

Both the asparagus & arugula salad   and the crispy (breaded and fried) artichoke hearts   were just okay. On the other hand, the sweet corn tamale ravioli (filled with cheese & bits of poblano chiles) was a winner.

Fist he's on his phone behind the host both and he noticed us 5min later,    Food was ok server was ok , but to many tables for him never got a refill , after I asked for the Check and try to pay , the waiter says sorry sir its declined ... (I'm from out of town ) so I called my bank and they said no sir u should be ok. Looks like they typed in wrong info and should only slide card. Have them run it again my bank says.        2 mins later the manager comes back and say all good went through. Then looks at the check and he made a mistake. He charged someone else's bill to my card so he goes back refunds it and tried to charge me and he tells me my card is declined. Not once did he apologize for the long wait or the mistake his employee made by typing in info instead of sliding the card. Not once did he apologize for his mistake charging my card. Ended up paying cash but no one should ever go through this . I as a manager would have apologized and maybe applied a discount or wave the whole bill for his mistake and his employee.

I ordered the California Club, and as you can see in the picture, came with 6 oz of bread and four pieces of chicken. At 13.00 bucks, you would expect a little more. Oh BTW, that was just for the sandwich alone.  We signed up for the ""loyalty card"" and received a free ""little plate."" We both chose the fried mac and cheese.

Meanwhile our dirty plates and glasses were still on the table for 15 min. Someone else brought us our coffee and tea, she didn't brought any plates with it so she just put the tea spoons on our dirty plates which we had used for dinner! Still, after this lady brought us our coffee & tea, our dirty plates and glasses and silverware were still on the table which made our table look like a mess.  When I wanted to make my tea I notice that there was barely any hot water in the little tea kettle and that it was very dirty inside.  I asked for new tea kettle that is actually filled with hot water. When I got my new hot water I made my tea and when I finished pouring water in my tea cup I saw the exactly same amount of water that was left in the tea kettle as I got it with the first one: no doubt they just grabbed a previous guest's tea kettle and gave it to me!

I went here for dinner, catching up with a few friends I hadn't seen in months. I've been going to CPK for years, and they are consistently reliable, consistently good. However, it's like any large food chain--too big, too commercial for my taste.  Wild Mushroom pizza: great pizza. The mushrooms were very tasty. It tasted amazing once I put parmesan on it.  Fettuccine Alfredo pasta: decent pasta; not sure if it's any better than what I can buy in a jar at the grocery store.  California Club pizza: pretty good. It was basically a cesar salad on top of a bacon/caramelized onion pizza. Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, chicken and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with avocado, chilled arugula, basil and romaine tossed in lemon pepper mayonnaise. It would seem like an odd combination, but who can beat a 2 for 1.  Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake a la mode: Mmm... Gluttony.

Today our chopped salad was comprised of the root ends of romaine lettuce, some very sad tomatoes, and canned black beans and canned corn.  I think they kept the leaves to use in the Caesar salad, which was oddly accompanied by a herb-ranch dressing.  The sandwiches were all on focaccia bread and were really tiny.  Maybe an inch across?  Too much bread and not enough filling.  The desserts were just OK too.

We sampled their new flat bread menu. My favorite was the one with fennel sausage. I was really blown away by the quality and size of their salads. Our table shared the Caramelized Peach salad and the Roasted Veggie salad. All the ingredients were fresh. The dressing was tasty without being overbearing.  Most surprising of all was the dessert! We shared the Salted Caramel Pudding (yum!) and the melt-in-your-mouth Butter Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream (food coma, be damned!). It's funny - I always had preconceived notions of CPK.

The food is great, I cannot stress that enough.  But when you come to CPK, you know what to expect (at least if you have been there before) so I really am looking for a fun or relaxing dinner and that is exactly what you can get.  The noise level is appropriate, too.

We started off with Lettuce cups with shrimp & a Spinach & artichoke dip.  The lettuce cups were nice & crispy but super wet like they were just washed & dumped on the plate.  The actual shrimps were also a little too sweet.  The dip was really run-of-the-mill.  For main, we shared a Pesto chicken pizza which was pretty small & pretty meh.

We rushed in to quickly order take-out so we could scat as soon as possible to avoid driving/parking fines.  We ordered a Thai pizza, shrimp scampi, two soups (tortilla and pea), and a chicken pasta (forgot the name). Everything was prepared within 15 minutes. The manager realized that we were in a hurry and he rushed the workers. They weren't slow, we just needed to go. Thanks! As for the food. It was good. The Thai pizza was bizarre because I have never had it before. The chicken pasta was large--we had three chicken breasts in that dish. My favorite was the shrimp scampi--because nothing could go wrong with garlic and butter. The food was bit on the salty side, but decent.

The food also was well done and very well served.  I mean I have always loved the food quality here but today I saw lots of progress, change or improvements! My waitress was a  sweet young lady (I see her name as Lily on my receipt) and I think she did the best service I have ever seen at California Pizza Kitchen!  Here is the reasons: First of all she greeted me with a sweet smile and politely asked me if I like the table that she just guided me to.  Then after I made my order, she asked if I want my salad first.  She brought my drink first and the salad a bit later. And I got the food at the end. The timing was perfect and she was checking on me making sure that everything is ok or I need something else.  I just liked the way she did all of this process gracefully and politely. She is very respected and she knows her job really well. It's been so long since I got that quality of service in downtown San Francisco .   I just wanted to thank you guys for the amazing service and management.  Lily with her fantastic smile and service and you guys with the perfect food just made my day!

Also, the take out people were really nice. They offered me bread and olive oil.  Why 3 stars? The pizza was expensive and the olive oil container had a crack, causing some oil spillage.

Joanna L.,"Los Angeles, CA",482,760,930,3.0,1/8/2014,"Last night in SF and both my parents and brother were exhausted after a days walk in the SF Botanical Garden and Fishermen's Wharf, we decided to just order takeout  from this CPK which was conveniently located right across our hotel (the Westin on Market St). I love how they have online ordering too - made it so easy and mistake free - as long as there's no computer glitches...heh. So for dinner we ordered: a thin crust meat craver's pizza, a veggie lover regular crust pizza, a thai chicken pizza, half of Caesar salad and half of a Cobb salad. I thought that the Caesar and Cobb salad would be a lot since it was pretty expensive - about 11 dollars for the Cobb and 8 dollars for the Caesar - however it was pretty small when I got it. Thin crust meat cravers pizza was good but the crust was a little soggy and not crispy like I wish it would be.  Thai chicken pizza wasn't how I remembered it - it wasn't as good unfortunately - a lot of carrots and sprouts but not a lot of chicken and the sauce was super salty.  Veggie lovers pizza - best pizza out of the group - nice and abundant variety of veggies! always good. :) Both salads were just overpriced for the portions.  The take out service was alright - I didn't know that they have to charge 10 cents for the bag that we needed to carry out the three pizzas and two salads....but at least it wasn't a plastic bag - it was a reusable bag and kind of a cool carrier too.  I was kind of disappointed the girl forgot to give us the bread for the take out - but the pizzas was more than we can eat anyways.

The service was pretty fast and our waiter was sweet, although he did offer us cigarettes at the end of our meal, which we found to be a bit strange. We couldn't decide if he was joking, but hopefully so since you can't smoke inside restaurants in California. Not to mention no one should be offered cigarettes when 8 months pregno like myself.

Alas, I bit the bullet and came here for a post-happy hour dinner with my colleagues from work. The venue is huge, and you'll find yourself being escorted between what seemed like dozens of rows of tables. I started my meal with low expectations. On the other hand, I have to admit that these folks make some really good pizzas. They won't change your life or anything, but you'll be perfectly satisfied with a white pizza ($12.10) and the spicy chipotle pizza ($12.85). Extra points for some creative pizza offerings, like the habanero carnitas original crust pizza ($13.6).  On average, us hungry folks downed one pizza per person with ease. Huge fan of the appetizer menu. In fact the apps were the star of the table, with everyone reaching restlessly for the morsels.

My favorite is the $9.99 BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad which is a ginormous mound of chopped lettuce, black beans, sweet corn and jicama, mixed with cilantro, basil, shredded Jack cheese and crispy corn tortilla strips tossed together in a ranch dressing. It's all topped with chunks of chopped chicken breast, diced tomatoes and chopped scallions. An in-between item I go for are the $7.99 Chicken Lettuce Wraps, nominally an appetizer but bigger than you would expect. It's a jumbo version of what you'd find at a trendier Chinese restaurant - minced chicken mixed with shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, green onions in a soy-ginger sauce. It comes with what looks like a head of iceberg lettuce, even though it has have been carefully unlayered for pocketing purposes. The menu gets mixed marks for me, but the space on 3rd Street is hugely expansive. It has a warmish, prairie-style feel like they were going for Frank Lloyd Wright but in a chain restaurant sort of way. The college-age server was attentive to the point of hovering, but we didn't mind his unintentionally unctuous manner. He has plenty of time to grow bitter like me. FOOD - 3.5 stars....great and hearty salads, appetizers suffer from super-sizing, and the pizzas just get carried away with themselves AMBIANCE - 4 stars...I like the wide, open spaces but haven't been here when it was packed with large parties SERVICE - 4 stars...he tries...oh Lord, he tries TOTAL - 3.5 stars...leaving it at 3 stars until I take another shot at their other menu options",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=160

WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE EVER. Apparently, the waiter didn't put our orders in right away. Then had the kitchen rush it. INCOMPETENT IDIOTS.   Gave us free/gross looking slices of cake.

My best guy friend and I were at the SFMoMA and dying to eat something that wasn't trendy, high priced, or made with ingredients we couldn't pronounce so like a beacon on the very dark oversized alley called 3rd and Market, we saw the CPK sign and immediately knew that was the one place we could agree on.  We were greeted by two hosts who were cleaning the windows and sat immediately and given a whole library of menus. Our server Maria was adorable and made helpful suggestions about the few menu items we were familiar with. I love their new small bites menu and the wedge salad, greek plate, and the half glass of wine are a wonderful idea!  My buddy and I split the chopped salad and the broccoli and sun-dried tomato fusilli. The appetizers and entrees were timed just right and everything tasted amazing and hit the spot. The only problem with doing 3 courses at CPK is that you can't seem to move onto the 4th.

Not all understood why, but hey, I like consistency and stability). If the bro came he'd get a pizza. This was a tradish for us and thus I became very fond of the restaurant. After coming here though one tired Saturday night, I was shocked to find the menu had CHANGED.  No more sundried brocolli tomato fusilli.  I'm not sure what I did after that.  Maybe got the BBQ chicken pizza, but was bitter most of the time.

Sure enough we were sat immediately and our server made sure to visit our table within a few minutes. He made great recommendations and didn't mind that we were often caught up in conversation.  I wish I could say the meal was as pleasant as the staff. My co-worker did mention to me that one of the reasons she was reminded that she did not dine at CPK as much as she would like was due to the calorie counts that are all over the menu. She told me she felt embarrassed and it often discouraged her to order what she really wanted.  I ordered a raspberry-lemon drop martini (which was recommended by our server) and it was quite delicious! I then ordered the tequila-lime chicken fettuccine and received it at a luke warm temperature and was surprised to see small bits of what looked like chicken nuggets versus chicken breast. There was definitely a lack of quality with my pasta dish. The dessert that was ordered was the strawberry shortcake and although the ice cream we added to it made it taste better, the biscuit was overly dry and we ate around it.

Dinner was very delicious! and we were having a good time even though, the server didn't give us bread. i know CPK offer bread but our sever said "" it's too late so we don't have any more bread."" i understood but the unpleasant moment is when we paid the check. our check amount was $72.23 something,my father gave $100 bill to our server, but the server gave us change $27 without NO CHANGE, so i asked him (the sever is a white guy with brown color beard and has very loud voice) ""where is my changes?"" and then he is acting weird, he just grope his body and his pants pockets and siad out loud "" NO Change!"". I felt very unpleasant. I didn't ask  the change from his pocket.I just asked him about my change from restaurant.  i meant, i felt bad about our server's acting. i understand if the restaurant has any change because we came late but he sould ask us before he gave us check or change. that is MANNER!

I mean, it's a chain, and it's pretty consistent and good, but not mind-blowing.  I sort of group it with places like Cheesecake Factory, in that it's consistent, has an extensive menu, and is a safe bet.   I think that most of the pizzas on the menu are fairly good.  I can't remember all the ones I've tried (sorry, I know I'm being extremely helpful right now), but I don't think you can really go wrong with them.  They're all solid pies, cooked right, and best of all, CREATIVE.  The crust is good, the toppings are generous, and you'll usually always bring some leftovers home for a midnight snack or tomorrow's lunch.  Good deal.  The last time I went, however, I experienced an epic food fail, and thought that I should warn you all.  First of all, they didn't give us any bread.  They usually start you off with some, but I guess they forgot?  Not cool.  Then, my friend and I ordered the Moroccan chicken salad to share (since we had just come from eating a meal right beforehand, that's how we roll).  Anyway, it was just a WHACK and badly made salad.  The ingredients struck me as just simply ODD when put together.  There were dates, beets, some generic dressing, tasteless bits of chicken, avocados, tomatoes, lettuce.  I don't know. . .I'm a big fan of good salads, but this was just really weird and tasted like nothing.  Very odd pairings of ingredients.  And by odd, I really mean BAD.  We still ate it, but it was not good.  Don't get this.

Steph L.,"San Francisco, CA",203,120,4563,4.0,8/22/2009,"When CPK first opened several years ago, I was skeptical that this restaurant would survive in this neighborhood.  The neighborhood is an outskirt of the downtown area, has a dark alley and busy bus stop.  I'm also not a big fan of chain restaurants since it's usually mediocre and not as authentic as local Bay Area restaurants.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when we entered the venue.  The decor was nice and bright and I was surprised that there was little to no wait for a table of 6 on a Sunday evening. Since this was my first experience at CPK, I did some yelp research prior to my visit.  I was craving for something pesto [based on other yelpers' reviews] but wasn't too crazy about ordering pizza partly because I've seen the CPK pizzas in the frozen aisle at your local supermarket.  I also heard nothing but raves about this chain restaurant and its how their food is consistent.   I ordered a Mango Mojito.  I was a little disappointed at the Mango Puree, but overall it was decent although I definitely had better.  We started off with the Avocado Club Eggrolls and Spinach Artichoke Dip.  I must say the Avocado Club Eggrolls surprised me [since I typically don't order eggrolls unless its the Vietnamese Imperial Rolls], but the the dip it came with was typical Ranch and Thousand Island dressing.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was DELICIOUS [A MUST TRY], I seriously could not stop myself from getting seconds and thirds.  I shared Pesto Creme Penne entree with my friend, since we were already semi-stuffed from the appetizers.  We were definitely disappointed, it was something we could have done ourselves at home for like $5.  Unfortunately, we did not have the appetites to start with the dessert menu. The waiter was pretty attentive and filled our waters frequently, asked for additional drinks/food for busing half tables at the restaurants.  Pros: - All Day Parking @Ellis-O'Farrell  [on Sundays] only $6  - MUST TRY 1) Spinach Artichoke Dip and 2) Avocado Club Eggrolls - Decent attention from the waiter - Short wait to be seated Cons: - I actually tried calling to place a dinner reservation for a party of 6 [since yelp and the CPK website showed that they took reservations], but apparently they don't take reservations unless its a party of 8. - Pesto Creme Penne was not good at all.  I felt like it was something I could make at home.

The floor manager came out with the salad, and instead of offering to remake it, he gave me an etiquette lesson on how to order. After making a 45 second deal about whether I really wanted it remade, he loudly offered my salad to my dining partner, repeating that it's just going to be wasted and thrown away. The food itself was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Day 2: We sat outside (which was nice) and our server (who was billed as ""one of the best"" by our host) was brash and came off as impatient even with questions like, ""what local beers do you have?"" (the menu prompts you to ask.) My partner ordered the Four Seasons (each topping represents a season, cute idea, right?) without mushrooms, which our server informed us ""only made it three seasons."" We thought it was a joke, but then he paused and waited as if to let us reconsider our choice, as we had picked the wrong answer. Later, we asked which seasons were represented by each topping. The server didn't know, he'd learned in his training, but forgot. He told us to just make something up. (To his credit, he asked another server later and told us.) My pizza (all hot toppings) was cold and tasted like it had been left in a window too long.  The same floor manager was on, and came over to tear open our promotional cards, and upon seeing me, said something to the effect of, ""I hope you remembered to order your dressing on the side this time!"" with just a tad too sharp an edge to be joking. He took the promotional cards and opens them (like a server's supposed to) then scratched away the part that the customer does, while holding it away from me, and read my results to me. (10% off, sorry you didn't win anything.)  The employees didn't seem particularly thrilled with their jobs (several complaining about being under staffed and phasing too early both days) and it showed. One server referred to the host as ""the hostess girl,"" which I thought came off as pretty condescending. All and all, I was pretty disappointed that our annual CPK experience was such a letdown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=200

Anna C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,31,1,4.0,8/2/2011,"CPK has always been a great restaurant chain in my book. I went to my first one outside of California, actually, and have been hooked ever since the early 90's. Our only CPK in SF (since the one on Van Ness closed down), is conveniently located in a major artery of the city - great access to businesses, hotels and downtown public transport. The restaurant is well-maintained and well-staffed. I am greeted each time I enter, and thanked each time I leave - really an overall stellar experience. I commend the restaurant for re-vamping its menu and catering to more gluten-free foods, well done! The salads and pizza are great options. I'm less hooked on the soups and pastas, maybe need to try them a bit more to be a better judge of quality. For the price, and consistency of service and quality, CPK is a great lunch/dinner option that won't break the bank! The only suggestions I have are: 1 -  to re-evaluate the temperature level in the restaurants - safe some energy, they don't need to be that cold! AND, 2 - to check the music level - always way too loud for my tastes.

Jonathan D.,"San Francisco, CA",50,29,,3.0,2/5/2012,"We decided to try out CPK for a post Super Bowl dinner.The place was pretty empty and the service was fairly prompt. We had a nice server, who was more than happy to help, but got some of the order wrong.  We ordered;  App: Firecracker Shrimp: The portion was surprisingly small, and fairly bland. It tasted like the walnut prawns you can get at any chinese restaurant tossed in some Sriracha. It was small shrimp,in a pile on top of fried sai fun noodles. I could have made it at home, better, in 5 minutes. Entree: Meat Lovers Pizza: I hate canadian bacon - since it is not real bacon and has that smack of ham flavor I cant stand. I asked the server if I could substitute the canadian bacon for extra peperoni. He said that would be fine. I also asked to get the Multi-grain crust. I received the pizza pretty quickly. It was hot and fresh and really tasty. The only issue with the pizza was that it was on the honey wheat, not multi grain, crust with the canadian bacon invading the harmony of the other meats. At that point I didn't mind so I ate it anyway. Im sure there was a mix up in the kitchen and he picked up the wrong pizza. Lemon Chicken Piccata: It came pretty quickly. The chicken was cooked well and it was nicely presented. Upon first bite the lemon flavor was overwhelming, but then quickly mellowed into the other flavors of the sauce. Each bite was another lemon attack. It wasn't bad, per se.... it was just intense. The pasta portion of the dish was a little undercooked. It was still hard and gummy to the bite. Otherwise it was pretty good.  Desert: This is where the meal shined. Brownie Sunday & Soufflé Cake - similar flavor profiles but by far the soufflé cake outshone the brownie sunday. The Sunday is served in a ala mode with some whipped cream garnishes. Its pretty good. The soufflé cake is the Brownie Sunday on crack. Its lighter fluffier and its served in a pool of rich vanilla cream. Its soft, and velvety and extremely tasty.  The overall meal was good, It wasn't great. The portions were pretty small. The food came fast, and hot. The server was pretty nice and helpful as well. Over all the meal was ok.

Simone W.,"San Francisco, CA",544,102,7,3.0,3/15/2010,"I'm finally becoming a San Franciscan!!! :-D Conference at the Westin Market St day one. Small group decided to go to CPK which is just across the street from the hotel. My first thought was ""No!!!!!! We are in SF!!!!!! Why would we go to a chain restaurant when there are thousands of places to be explored?!?!?!""  But I chose not to speak my truth and just sighed. :-( It was Saturday afternoon and the place was busy, which surprised me. 20 minute wait for a group of 5. I looked around and couldn't really figure out if the crowd was local or tourists, although in my mind I WAS SURE only tourists would commit such sacrilege.  We sat down and it took almost 10 minutes for the waitress to arrive. She was friendly and guaranteed she would get our food fast, as we were pressing for time. After looking at the plethora of choices on the menu and the big portions all around me, I decided for the Tuscan hummus with honey whole-wheat pita. My friend chose the cesar salad with shrimp. Others had salads, soup and the ravioli. She kept her word - the food did come fast. As to my hummus, of course I have had much better and didn't expect to have the hummus of my life at CPK. The pita was very good though.  My friend's cesar looked somewhat poor, without pizazz, and I have to say that all the dishes looked like that - just meh. We ate and talked about our experiences at the conference. Nobody was AMAZED by the food, but it served the function of a fast lunch just across the street.

We were in a large party, around 15 - 20 people and it was my ex's 21st birthday dinner. They have this strange rule of not seating parties until everyone arrives, but luckily we are all fairly punctual and we were sat promptly.  Though the menu is varied, the food has a unified chain-like taste. This however, is not a bad thing because i enjoyed the menu items we selected. The thai chicken salad is a bit salty, but the oriental flavors of cilantro and peanut standout quite well. I am a fan of their BLT and Scampi Pizzas, unique and tasty.  Even though we were a party, service was spot on.

They usually have my diet coke refill on the table before I am half finished my first one. Both recent times I've been there with a 10+ person party, and they have tripped over themselves to serve us and accommodate us. The food, for a chain, is decent. The menu has a lot of items but they are all variations on salad, pizza, pasta, chicken. Even the pickiest eaters can find something they like, and the ingredients taste pretty fresh for a chain. I'm a fan of their Thai chicken pizza. Today I had the Thai Chicken Salad (dressing on the side), and it too was good. I've never had an issue there.

Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,5.0,11/28/2015,"Surprised to see such mixed reviews on this place. Having a conference for work back in early October led me to a location pretty much across the street from this place. I was with my co-workers on an hour and a half lunch break and one pitched the idea of pizza. I saw the California Pizza Kitchen and I was a bit skeptical at first. My skepticism was based around the fact that the town I live in (Stockton, CA) had a CPK near the Mall for only a brief time before it went under. I hadn't eaten at the location when it was in town but had automatically assumed that it wasn't any good. Also, when you look at a Brand that pushes out Frozen Pizzas (see -  ), you start thinking the real deal is going to be as weak as the Frozen Pizza. I should've known better.  We sit down with about a party of 10 total and we're immediately greeted and have our drink orders taken. It was pretty dead inside for a Monday afternoon around lunch time. I noticed a couple people walk in and one of the employees knew them (as if they were regulars there). With it being pretty quiet inside with only a handful of parties, I started gauging the employee culture. I heard the bartender cracking jokes with a server, and every employee had what looked like to be a genuine smile on their faces. There was a sincere personable vibe among the staff on how they were treating the customers. It came off as if every person walking in the door was a regular.  We waited a bit for the food to come out (necessary with a party of 8). The wait wasn't too bad. The food was cooked to perfection. It's like everything came off the oven at the same time. My pizza was hot, it had more of a soft texture to the dough instead of a crispy texture, but the pie still had the golden brown look to it. Our waiter was very attentive and offered us refills to go. Overall we had a fantastic time and the food was really good. The conference was a multi-day event and I ended up eating here again the following day. Wish there was one in my town that did as well. I know Pizza is a hard business to be in. Look at all of the chains out there, along with the non chain businesses, you can pretty much find pizza anywhere every couple of blocks in San Francisco. Next time I come to town and I'm in the area, I'll be stopping by. Expect me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=40

Even though we came at the height of fidi lunch time (12:30pm), there were still open tables (not sure if that's a good thing...). We decided to do family style, and we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 pizzas, 1 salad, and 1 pasta. For the appetizers, we ordered the avocado rolls, a spinach-ish dip with chips, and the humus. All the dishes were good. We ordered the spicy Italian sasuage pizza and some mango-chicken pizza. The mango-chicken one was very flavorful, unique, and delicious. Finally, we got some portobello mushroom raviolis. That was good too. Service was attentive and good. Overall, this place is great. The price is slightly high for the portions, but this is fidi.

The menu is fairly broad, so there should be something for everyone. The ambiance is pleasant and roomy - not an easy find in SOMA. And, if you get there before 12:00, there is almost never a line, unless there is a huge convention at Moscone. I usually order the thin crust pizza, and it rarely disappoints. However, the last time I was there with colleagues, my pizza was dry as a cracker and somewhat cold. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to delay my colleagues.

There were only a few customers and yet we stood at the door for a good while until someone finally appeared to take care of us. Annoying, but our super friendly and helpful waiter made up for it. For a chain, the food is great. I was happy with my carne asada pizza and my friend enjoyed her wild mushroom one. We loved the crust, which is pretty uncommon for both of us. We shared the white corn guacamole for an app; it was okay, but I wouldn't waste money on it again. I was amused by the effort in plating bland guac and freaking Tostitos.

We had heaters above, but one was broken, and the others didn't let off enough heat to keep anyone warm. b) Waiter consistently forgot requests. A friend ordered an appetizer and a pizza and the appetizer came -after- the pizza, even though she asked for it to come before. c) Water was only refilled once 90% of the table ran out completely. Lemonade was never refilled. d) Bread was the last thing to arrive. Hello? Luckily they didn't bother us when we had to wait for another thirty minutes in the outside patio area for our ride.

Michael N.,"Daly City, CA",71,48,4,4.0,12/13/2009,"Had lunch with a good friend here last week. This was my first time in this location and I must say the atmosphere is nice. It seemed like a more upscale restaurant than CPK.  The server offered us free wine, which was certainly a nice offer. My friend took them up on a glass of pinot grigio. As we could have imagined it was just an ounce or two, which was just enough to whet her appetite for lunch. Makes me recall my time in Paris where most restaurants would offer a free digestive (liquer) before lunch!  I had iced tea, which if you know me is my favorite drink with lunch. I like iced tea so much that it can almost ruin my lunch if it's bad tea. CPK's was okay. My friend ordered fish tacos, which I know doesn't sound like something you'd get at CPK, but they know pizza isn't for everyone. She liked them. What I found curious though is that they come with chips and salsa and the salsa portion seemed to be the largest part of her lunch. I guess it makes the whole entree look more substantial. Little wine, big salsa. I had a veggie sandwich on onion and herb bread along with the minestrone soup. The sandwich was tasty and right sized for lunch. The soup was salty. I exchanged it for the split pea and barley, which hit the spot on a cold and damp day. We did not have dessert. All in all I was pleased with the atmosphere, service and food.

More than the ravioli dish! Double boo :( BUT, the new Moroccan Chicken Salad is very low in calories, and it's very delicious: Moroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers.

Food is good, tasty and consistently dependable:  - I've had the bruschetta for appetizers and any of the pasta dishes that had a white wine sauce for a main course.  - The chicken rolls are good too. Light fare with good guacamole - Try the pesto pasta - very nice! Also tried the jambalaya with shrimp which knocked my knickers off... ok... just my briefs with how savory and spicy it was! - Wine selection is not bad. Had a Pinot Noir which was nice, fruity and went very well with any of the pasta dishes. Have a decent selection of beers as well as draft beers... it ain't no Pilsner but does the trick. 2. Service staff is friendly but definitely a wee bit quirky (thanks for giving the right word, Jessica T.!): - Sometimes uber friendly and approachable, then again, sometimes somewhat standoffish, and then again, sometimes a bit lost. - But last time I went there, the chef in training cooked my dinner with the wrong kind of pasta and the server was apologetic, and offered to send it back which was thoughtful. I had it as is... why waste food... its just pasta! 3. Location: - Nice location and almost a quiet getaway when you walk in from noisy 3rd street - Great place I visit sometimes on the way back from work when I'm too lazy to cook, want to load up on carbs and a nice glass of wine, a book and some quiet time - Noise level is low so if you like a quiet meal, head here - Never tried the outdoor seating just because 3rd street can be a wind tunnel some days but think they have heat lamps All in all, nice place, dependable, consistent, good food, good ambience and definitely a chain I frequent regularly either by myself or with friends.

I called in ahead of time and when I went to pick up the order, I got FABULOUS customer service every step of the way. I was greeted kindly and directed to the takeaway station, and every associate working at the takeaway counter participated in putting my order together. There was someone telling me she put (tons!) of bread and butter in the bag, another repeating my order, and I believe a manager ringing me up. Everyone was extremely kind and friendly!  Also, I usually have my vendors credit card or a copy with their signature and authorization of me using their credit card with me and the manager here was very kind in taking the information and making sure it was all legitimate. I showed him my ID/badge and everything. I didn't feel at all that he was giving me a hard time but was being very careful to make sure no fraud was being committed, I really appreciated that.  Even though I made it there a little late to pick up the food, everything was packed neatly and still fresh when we opened it all up to eat. It was packed separately so nothing was soggy.

She came back to the table without our drinks (which were waters) to take or food order. We each ordered a petite wedge salad and a gluten free Jamaican Jerk to share. She finally came with our waters about ten minutes later. When she brought out our salads she asked if we wanted any dressing on them. I though that was a better question to ask when taking the order. She brought our dressing at the same time as our pizza.

I've gotten three pizzas consistently, although I should try to get some other kinds of pizzas to diversify my palate: Jamaican Jerk, ""The Works,"" and the carne asada pizza, which comes with this salsa-like tomatoes that I would rather wish they didn't include. All of those pizzas are fantastic (yes even the carne asada with the tomatoes I dislike).  The servers are also fantastic; they are quirky, upbeat, and very down-to-earth.

Yan G.,"San Francisco, CA",367,485,4,3.0,5/9/2008,"CPK is definitely not the best pizza money can buy.  It's not even all that great, and it's actually pretty expensive.   CPK allows you to be pretty creative with your pizza.  I mean, can you get a Thai Chicken pizza (chicken, peanut sauce, bean sprouts, basil, etc) or a California Club pizza (lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, avocado, etc) at your local pizza joint?  Unlikely. Somehow, you even get the illusion that their pizza is good for you.  ""California"" must mean healthy.  Sure, CPK pizza is not as greasy as those pies at some of your regular pizza hangouts, but who are we kidding?  It's still pizza. The decor screams ""chain restaurant,"" but at least you get a booth most of the time.  I also like the open kitchen, so you can watch your pizza being made.  I guess you can't expect luxurious digs at a restaurant sharing the building with an Office Depot and a parking garage (see my review of Hearst Parking Center). Also, I don't really understand the one and only TV in the corner, always showing CNN.  What's wrong with showing ESPN or a ballgame? Service here is hit or miss.  My friend and I have lunch here a couple of times a month, and we never know how we'll be treated on this particular day.  Most waiters are polite and courteous, but are, by en large, incompetent.  Due to a high turnover rate, it is sometimes hard to find someone who knows what he/she is doing.  You always see waiters with that confused look on their face, trying to use the restaurant computer. 3 helpful tips from 'regulars' for you: * Show up before the noon lunch rush, or risk waiting in line for a while.   * Make sure to ask for bread and butter, or risk not getting either. * Order a half salad for 2 people to share, or risk having leftover salad on your gigantic plate.

Jay Y.,"Cerritos, CA",172,239,931,4.0,4/18/2009,"Life saver.. that pretty much sums up what I think about this place. Easter weekend, my gf and I decided to take a trip up north to the Bay area just to get away from the Los Angeles/Orange County life.  ON Easter Sunday, we got so wrapped up in sightseeing that we forgot that restaurants would most likely close earlier on that day.  The original spot where we wanted to eat dinner at of course closed WAY earlier than anticipated so we were stuck with trying to find a place to eat at 8:30 at night.  Seeing how we were from out of town, we didn't know what San Francisco had to offer for dining spots, especially on Easter Sunday.. so the hunt began and every place we called was in the process of closing or was already closed.  For sure we didn't want fast food or some mediocre food so it started to become mission impossible for us... that is until we came across CPK. It was already 9PM.. I called and they said they were to close at 10PM.. luckily we just happened to be right around the corner, so CPK it is. First off, as far as CPK goes, this CPK is just like any other CPK.  The menu is the same, the quality of food is the same.. it's just an all around ordinary American restaurant.. nothing to WOW about.  The reason I gave one extra star over an ordinary ""A-OK"" rating.. was because of the service.. especially close to closing hours. Rachael was our original server.  Very polite, very helpful.. and surprisingly in an upbeat mood for being close to closing hours and at the end of her shift.. I don't think that girl knows how not to smile.  haha. My gf and I were REALLY hungry at that point and since we were on vacation, we decided to ""splurge"" a little bit.  We ordered two appetizers (the Singapore Shrimp Rolls and the Lettuce Wraps) and we each had the Jambalaya pasta.... yea we were pigs that night.  The food was good but nothing extraordinarily special.. just glad to have found decent food.  Rachael on the other hand was very helpful and patient.. although it did take a while for her to get to our table to take our order.. but understandably so, I don't take kind to waiters who keep pestering you to hurry up and place an order so I wasn't too bothered by it.   I did find it a bit odd as to why her tables were spread across the restaurant which was why I thought it was taking her a bit long to get to our table.  Once our appetizers got to our table, she was quite attentive to our needs and made sure everything was up to par as far as our dining experience was going.  About half an hour into our dinner, she informed us that she was coming off her shift and headed home and that Kat was going to be taking her place (which I find very responsible because now days most people just leave and the next waiter just takes over).   Even as she was leaving, she was still working.. giving us a smile and waiving goodbye. Kat was very polite and helpful as well.. but her attentiveness to her patrons wasn't as on par as Rachael's.  Kat disappeared from time to time but again.. it was already past 10PM at that point, so I can understand that she had closing/cleaning responsibilities as well.   Overall.. it was a pleasant dining experience especially since we were coming at closing time on Easter Sunday.  For out-of-towners.. I was very satisfied and felt welcomed for my business.  I'd dine here again because of the experience but then again.. it's JUST California Pizza Kitchen.  Never know tho.. maybe I'd find myself in SF again craving CPK??  haha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=360

The atmosphere of the dining room is warm and the open kitchen with the wood oven gives the restaurant a homey feel.  The menu is big and filled with many options. I settled for the CPK tropical tea with rum, lemonade and ice tea. It was tasty, but a bit on the weaker side. For dinner, I ordered a cup of the split pea & barley soup and a half order of the Original BBQ Chicken chopped salad - my favorite dish ever! Both were delicious and I was not disappointed at all. The half size portion is very generous and I ended up taking some home.  Our server was very sweet and though she made some mistakes, it didn't matter. I had asked for the dressing on the side for my salad and it came with dressing and when I mentioned it, she apologized right away and put in a new order.

Karen K.,"San Francisco, CA",43,156,115,4.0,8/20/2007,"This is the most gorgeous CPK I have ever been to!  The interior is really well decorated and designed.  There is a patio out front with heat lamps and those clear plastic walls.  The main dining room is decked out in warm honey tones with lots of wood and stone.  There are a lot of counter seats and overlook the open kitchen.  I went last Saturday and the crowd was very white (probably 95%) and looked touristy. Onto the food - yes, it is a chain, but I really like CPK.  The food was consistent and tasted just how I expected it to.  For starters we shared the spinach artichoke dip and The Works pizza.  The dip is really good and came with blue and white tortilla chips.  I think it tastes better with the plain white tortilla chips.  The Works pizza was ok - nothing special.  Apparently it is a new addition to the menu. For the entrees, I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine.  It's really unique and it's not something you find easily anywhere else.  I like the tangyiness of it.  The portion size is medium, but definitely filling since it's on the oily side.  We also ordered the Fettuccine with Garlic Cream sauce with chicken.  It was good, but nothing special.  The Chicken Marsala, on the other hand, was fantastic!  It came with 3 generously sizes pieces of chicken and a side of pasta with asparagus and mushrooms.  The sauce is fantastic!  I highly recommend this dish.   For dessert, we ordered the Hot Fudge Brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  I am not a big chocolate fan when it comes to desserts, but I must say this was damn good.  The brownie was rich and soooo good! Because there are a few new pizza additions to the menu, it looks like they have discontinued my FAVORITE one...the Pear Gorgonzola with the salad on top.  I was very, very bummed.  :( Overall, I would definitely go back.  It wasn't that crowded (even on Saturday night), but that might be because it's sort of tucked away despite being close to Union Square and downtown.  I don't think they have really advertised this location.  This place is great if you're looking for Cheesecake Factory-esque food, but don't want to wait two hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=360

My first experience with this new storefront on 3rd street was pretty much what I expected: An above-average pizza at an outrageous price and a long wait.

On the first visit, I had to grab a pizza-to-go, and though the pizzas take 25 - 30 minutes to bake, I was not notified about this until toward the end of the wait.  I'll let that slide, since they're still working out all of their communication kinks. Jamaican jerk chicken doesn't really make for a very good pizza, since it's too sweet. But I would expect the other toppings to work much better.  The second visit wasn't as pleasant. I ordered fettucini with garlic and mushrooms, which ROYALLY SUCKED MY TIGHT ASS!  Good lord, that was horrible!

Finally at about 1:30 we tracked down the manager to tell him that this type of service is unacceptable and that our lunch hour was just about over so we were going to have to get our food to go. The manager packed up our lunches in to go boxes and brought them to us, and they were really cold, which meant our food had been sitting there for a while completely ignored by our server. The manager took the most expensive meal and a drink off the check, but then screwed up the charge to one of the credit cards so we had to wait longer to get that cleared up.

Having recently fell off the Vegetarian wagon, I indulged in the Tequila Chicken Fettuccine.  One of the best pasta dishes on the menu!! I also tried some of the Buffalo Chicken pizza which was really good.  The food is pretty much the same at every CPK, but what made this location stand out was the service.  The manager stopped by our table to check on us, which was a nice gesture.  Even when we left, the hostess asked us if we enjoyed our meal.  At chain restaurants, it's the little things like that that make the meal worthwhile.  I'd definitely visit this CPK again in the future. Some tips if you visit this location: They validate if you park in the Hearst Building Garage after 6pm, which means you have to park after six. (I misunderstood that and ended up having to pay $19 bucks to park for a few hours!!). Validation is only a discount, not free. My friend paid $11 for a few hours.

They seated our party of 6 promptly, no waiting. OH, I know! The boss did pay, so I at least I felt like I got my money's worth. I was completely underwhelmed by this place and I wasn't expecting much. I mean, after all, it is fast food pizza trying to be something that it's not. And I'm not even sure what that is. Anybody? I decided to order something safe, so got a pasta dish. I don't remember exactly which one, but that kind of sums up my whole experience there... forgettable. And they must be hard up for staff. They seemed way too friendly. The kind of awkward, personal-space-invading, trying-way-too-hard friendly. The waiter made a presumptive comment to me that was completely inappropriate, especially since he didn't know me, and I was with co-workers.

Sean D.,"Emeryville, CA",11,57,1,3.0,7/15/2008,"Let me start off on a bad note... I wonder if this one and the one in Emryville are managed by the same person; because at both the service leaves much to be desired. At this one, we got there and the place was only about half full, but there was still a few parties waiting to be seated and no one around the front to great people. After about 5 minutes, the 2 groups in front of us got seated, and then they skipped right past the 2 of us and seated the lady standing behind us! We would have walked out if we werent so tired from work that day.  Thankfully our waitress was much better then the hostess and the rest of the meal went great. Even though I still wish CPK would freshen up the ingredients of the food with a bit better quality. We left the waitress a good tip because she was great, but wished we could have made a note, not to split it with the front staff. This CPK was odd because usually its the host staff that is great and the servers that suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=380

The California Pizza Kitchen has a wide variety of unusual pizzas and also the normal pizzas that you would find everywhere. I like the specialty pizzas. They also serve pasta and salads.

Kelly G.,"Washington, DC",643,1117,2185,3.0,5/23/2009,"I am a chain restaurant pasta whore. I'd walked up and down Market street on a rainy Monday alone and famished long enough. I just wanted to be by myself. I'd declined two lunches from co-workers and other people at the conference. But I was starving, ravenous and strangely enough, eventhough I'd walked past tons of restaurants, delis, taco trucks, you name it, nothing was doing it for me. I wanted a big bowl of chowder in one of those bread bowls. Couldn't find it. Maybe I'd walked the wrong way out of the Hyatt. Anyway, I passed a guy with a CPK bag and thought hmmm...maybe that'll work. One of those huge bowls of pasta. So I turn on 3rd Street, cross my fingers. Yesss! I found it. Bellied up to the bar and ordered the shrimp, asparagus, spinach linguine. No tomatoes I say. The server assures me she can leave them on the side and refers to them as cecco. She also guarantees the dish and if I don't like it, she guarantees I can either get something else or get that dish fixed up to my liking. Well now that is an offer I can't refuse. When my dish comes, so does a huge dish of warm tomato, basil & garlic. Just the thing a person who originally asked for no tomatoes wants: a whole bowl of warm tomatoes, basil, & garlic. So I start in on the dish. It is fair. It could use some garlic cream sauce and some parmesan cheese. I pick at it till she comes back to ask how it is. Before I could even say ""it needs help"" she says ""it needs something doesn't it?"" I agree. So I send it back for the garlic cream sauce treatment. While I'm waiting, I ask for bread. Everyone else seems to have it but me. Oh well, no sweat. When the dish finally comes back out, I am in chain restaurant pasta heaven again. So creamy and swirly and mmmm good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=380

Tables are well spaced out and I would definitely suggest this place for groups. Pizza was amazing! Loved the crust. It was done just right. We had the wild mushroom pizza and enjoyed every bite. The pasta was a little more 'al dente' that I like but maybe that's my personal taste. The spinach artichoke dip was very tasty!

You don't have to stick to the menu either, they encourage you to experiment; I change up my pasta and pizza orders all the time with no attitude from the waiter.
