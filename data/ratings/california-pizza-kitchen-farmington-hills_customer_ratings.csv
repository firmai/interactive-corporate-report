31,Celestial P.,"Woodinville, WA",0,41,2.0,2.0,2012-09-03,"Pita-ful Policy: Can't a lady get a piece of bread around here? I went here for a dinner, and one of my dinner companions wanted a piece of bread to eat with her salad, just something to push the salad onto her fork.  Jenny, the waitress, informed her that they normally serve complimentary bread for free, but they were out of bread today. Instead she could buy 8 pieces of pita bread for a dollar.  She asked again if she could just have once piece? Jenny said no.  If she wanted bread, she'd have to buy a plate. Then she said that she didn't want it, on principle of the thing they should substitute accordingly and not charge her for a piece of bread.  The kerfuffle continued: should Jenny bring bread, and would she charge for it?  It was getting ugly. Another at our table insisted that she should bring the bread and he would pay the dollar. Nearly ten minutes passed before the pita bread arrived. In the meantime we asked ourselves why the waitress had brought four bread plates and distributed them around our booth if no bread was going to be given for them.  When Jenny arrived with the plate of pita bread, our salad lady asked, ""Did you ask the manager?  Jenny said no, she had not asked the manager. The bread would be charged. At the end of the meal, with a plate of 7 pieces of pita bread crowning the table, our salad lady asked the waitress, ""Did you charge for the bread?"" Jenny said yes, so she responded with, ""Well, then, I want to take it home with me.""  Whoa now, is anyone named Jenny paying attention? Customer is clearly still disgruntled. Would have been a good time to think of bringing the manager over, especially since the restaurant was now nearly empty of dinner crowd. Instead she brought a take-home box. She was polite, but tried to make herself scarce. The bread was charged on the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=20,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

In the meantime, as I was waiting I was watching other servers, especially the woman making pizza and another of what appeared to be a ""seasoned"" server.  The pizza lady touched everything.  She handled the food with her bare hands, I watched her do it again and again.  The ""seasoned"" server was preparing a to-go drink for someone and help the cup at the rim, with fingers inside the cup.  She cut bread using her bare hands and then picked the bread up with a plastic baggie, I assume to not further handle it.  I just wonder who's managing, or in this case, not managing this restaurant.  It was not busy, even though I was there at noon and there is just no excuse for sloppy and gross handling of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=40,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

27,N P.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",53,224,,4.0,2013-12-18,"4 stars for CPK in general so that's where my rating is.  But 3.5 stars for CPK in terms of service both at this location and 3 stars for service at the Troy location.   At this location, I've had to wait for what seemed like an eternity multiple times for carryout.  Also dining in is also slow but that could just be because of staffing issues.  The Troy location also has a long wait but that place always seemed busier.  At Troy, for whatever reason, our server ignored our empty water glasses and disappeared for long stretches of time.  I think she may have checked on us once to ask about our food.  Simply ordering pizzas and drinks should not take an hour-and-a-half on a weeknight toward the end of the night.    To be more positive, CPK as a chain has gone above and beyond for vegetarians and vegans by posting information about these options ( ).  They also have posted about allergen information ( ), gluten free options ( ), and nutrition information ( ).  OUTSTANDING.  I wish EVERY restaurant did this. Still, as noted on the website, there may be variations based on location so it is important to check with the server at each location.  At this location here in Farmington Hills at least they tried to help even though it took awhile.  I don't think there was any reference to these pdf lists though.  At Troy, I don't even think the server made an effort to help when I told her I was a vegetarian.  I ended up with a salad and no cheese there which is silly.  I wish I had known about this list. I do love CPK for posting this information on their website (Thank you CPK for acknowledging the vegetarians and vegans in the world lol)!  The food generally tastes great with nice combinations of toppings that taste pretty fresh (and with some creative toppings like pears) and a delicious crunchy crust.  I hope that service is better next time I visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills?start=20,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

The crust is on the thin side and the edges can get a little burned but over all the GF pizza is better than most. Great flavors and fresh ingredients. They also have a couple starters that are gluten free. My favorite is the guacamole and chips. It's avocado smashed with onion, corn, cilantro, and beans. It's really good.

The food isn't bad, but nothing to write home about, either. We went there on the first cold, snowy Sunday night of the season -- and they had no heat! We didn't realize it until after we'd ordered (we thought we were just cold from being outside), but then, we noticed other patrons sitting in their coats. We asked the server, and she basically said that they're aware of it. She apologized, but no offer of warm beverages or compensation of any kind. I decided to get the two in a bowl soup. I'd wanted the split pea with barley and the squash, but they were out of the squash, so I got potato. It arrived in a GIANT rimmed dish -- with a tiny, shallow bowl. it looked pretty, but it was literally 2 soups side by side in the same bowl, nothing separating them. And there wasn't much soup; probably not much more than a cup or cup and a half. It didn't come with bread or crackers or anything else.  And the dish it was in was stone cold. The pea soup was warm, but since the potato soup was hot enough, I didn't bother sending it back. For $8, it was not a good choice. My sister got the lettuce wraps & asked for additional lettuce and gave me some. It was pretty good, and my mom seemed to enjoy her flat bread. But again, nothing came with anything else.

But the arugula salad was pretty good. For be price, not worth it. I was sat by a bunch of real loud teenagers who acted like it was their first time in public. This set the tone for me, I was probably a bit grouchy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
17,K M.,"Keego Harbor, MI",0,1,,1.0,2016-06-01,"This past weekend, I ordered the pear+gorgonzola pizza. Within seconds of it being in front of me I saw a large earwig bug in the lettuce of my pizza! It was shocking and gross. The manager explained that that particular produce is pre-packaged. I'm confident that the bug came in the packaged lettuce, beyond their control.  This lettuce gets delivered to all CPKs, so beware! Although the staff was apologetic, we will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
12,heather o.,"Vista, CA",27,26,14.0,2.0,2016-10-07,I called ahead to order lunch for me and my salon girls. The guy who answered was fun and communicated well. When I came to pick up our order the girls that put it together sucked!!! I had to go threw the order to make sure it was right and they seriously only gave us 4 pieces of bread!!! There were 4 of us ordering and when I told them we needed more bread they gave us 4 more pieces I'm sorry but when you eat in they will bring you as much bread as you want but it's like pulling teeth when you call in!! It's not like our meals were discounted,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

7,M D.,"West Bloomfield, MI",30,65,11.0,4.0,2017-03-07,"Not just pizza. In fact, their pasta dishes and salads and wraps are some of the best in the neighborhood. Try their Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti, or the Kung Pao Spaghetti (yes, you read that right), or their Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza. Once you get over the diet-friendly portion sizes, you will very much enjoy your experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

I liked the way it was presented and also the dressing for it was delicious ..it wasn't too oily or soggy it was tender and crispy..a good substitute for chicken wings.. main course we had California veggie pizza and a mushroom pasta.. the ingredients on the pizza was very fresh and it wasn't layered wit extra unhealthy cheese like how other places prepare a pizza the size of it was also good to share or to have it as a whole....it was baked well and wasn't too heavy on the stomach wch makes u feel less guilty  the mushroom pasta was the best amongst all the pasta was soft and cooked well it tasted fresh and loved the way the whole dish was made... amount of Parmesan cheese and garlic were just perfect and  made the whole dish delicious... it was a very generous portion...  overall a nice place to have a good meal wit less guilt,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

1,Natalie D.,"Farmington, MI",23,13,4.0,2.0,2017-11-06,"My daughter and I were at Lululemon at 12 Oaks Mall and CPK had a table set up, where they were serving samples of their arugula & quinoa salad, as well as their corn & black bean guacamole. They were delicious, so we went downstairs to CPK for dinner to order the real deal. They were amazing!  Last night we were shopping at Hunter's Square and decided to stop at this CPK to order our new favorite salad and appetizer. We walked in and were greeted by the host, who offered to seat us (me ?) at the bar. I inquired about whether or not my 11yr old could sit at the bar, to which he replied ""no."" (So why are we discussing this? Lol!)  Our waitress took forever to come take our drink order. We placed our entire order, and she brought it all out together... Drinks included. Hmmm...  The guacamole was shaped like a small upside down cup. No effort at all to make it at least appear like it didn't come out of some sort of pre-packaged something. The avocado was in chunks... It was bizarre. Tastes the same, I suppose, but part of dining out is the presentation. The chips were stale. It was just bad.  The salad was just ok. Chicken added to it was fresh out of the microwave! Not impressed with this location. If I want CPK, I'm going back to the mall where they at least try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-farmington-hills,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
