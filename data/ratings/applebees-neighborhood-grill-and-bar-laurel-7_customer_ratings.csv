71,Katie M.,"Laurel, MD",13,41,2.0,1.0,2012-01-11,"Umm, really bad to say the least. I have been here twice, once before dinner when it was super quiet, and once late at night (11 PM) when they had kareoke. Needless to say, it was very loud and like an amateur version of American Idol. As a vegetarian, I tried to order an entree on my latter visit, but none were available automatically vegetarian. I asked the server if it would be possible for me to just remove the chicken from the entree, and he appeared baffled and told me he didn't know if it would be possible. Honestly at that point, I didn't care if he just ate the chicken himself or picked it off the plate before he delivered it! Ordering food with minor alterations should not be that difficult. Once I did get the entree it was a combination of too rich and horribly bland, it definitely sat like a brick in my stomach. Their desserts aren't terrible, but give the whole restaurant a pass if you can. Apparently people love it on Fridays though, based on the turnout that was there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7?start=60,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

The food is totally normal Applebee's quality, but if you don't have more than an hour to eat lunch, don't bother going here. The servers are generally friendly and have gotten my meal right everytime, it just seems to take forever for the food to actually come out of the kitchen, even when you sit at the bar and order immediately. It's also worth noting that I've never been during rush hour; usually between 2 or 4.

I eat at this Applebee's location due to lack of good dining options around my hotel. I was hungry so I decided to give it another chance. The server was very new, but he really tried very hard to be helpful which was nice. I had one of the new 550 calories items on the menu. I was not expecting much but was somewhat surprised that the ""sizzling chile lime chicken"" was kind of tasty. The rice was a little dry, but the chicken had decent flavor and the broccoli was cooked well.

Our waitress also lacked any personality and did not seem very friendly at all. She failed to refill drinks and anytime anything needed to be handled for our table she sent some other guy to do it!

I was just at the Applebees in Bowie two days before I met a friend here for lunch.  It happened to be convenient and centrally located so, yeah, Applebees it was. It wasn't overly crowded when we got there on a Saturday around noon which is really fine by me. Our waitress (Dani) was on top of things and super friendly with a great sense of humor. I went for the Signature Sirloin under 550 calories meal. (Watching my figure for the new year). Very tasty. Although, it has a slightly different configuration from the Bowie Applebees. Still, I enjoyed the meal. A plus - when I checked in on Foursquare and it tweeted out, Applebees connected to ask how lunch was on Twitter.  I like places that do that.   So, I'm good with this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7?start=20,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

74,Ricky J.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,10,,1.0,2014-02-15,"I bought a $50 gift card on Dec 23 & got $10 voucher to be used later. After Christmas, I went there alone for a quick bite, and was seated by a dreadlock waiter and told that he'll be right back. After almost 10 mins of waiting without menu, had to get up & help myself to a menu from a counter, then wait some more for him. Finally when he comes, I told him what I wanted to order & of the $10 voucher. He said not to worry and present it when check comes. I ordered something worth 12 & no drink. Food came in less than 5 mins, spich is very wilty & partially cold, as is the baked potato. Chicken is hard at the edges & rubbery in the middle. Forced myself to have few bites and wanted to pay, but no waiter in sight. I saw few waiters chatting away by counter when there is not a single soul in the whole restaurant, but they could care less than to check on me, when I'm looking around, so I had to get up, wave to them and still walked over to them, as they simply stared in my direction, instead of walking over to me. I asked for the check, which he brought & I gave him my credit card AND THE VOUCHER FOR $10. I got it back in 2 mins, placed on my table. When I opened it, saw that  they had  my cc $14 and not deducted the $10. At this point, since waiter was MIA, I got up, walked ove and asked to speak to the manager, who appeared after another long wait. He mumbled an apology about charge but no explanation about cold, wilty ""food"". He brought me another charge of $4 BUT NO RECEIPT FOR REFUND. He said the printer cant print receipt for refund buut it would show on my cc after few days. It never did and I ended up being charged $18, when I should have been charged $4.

I know how horrible that sounds, but it was true. I ordered the lunch special that included a soup and a main entree. I got the chicken tortilla soup and the mac and cheese with honey chicken tenders. There was no chicken to be found in my soup and it was salty, salty, and sour. I was very confused. And tomato-y. It was like super salty and chunky ketchup with a leaf of cilantro. Weird. The chicken tender was a joke. It reminded me of those pieces of bread you put in the microwave too long and they get hard and chewy. Also, it was like half of a half of a tender. Three pieces of chicken. I know it was a lunchtime deal, but y'all didn't have to do me like that. I must say that the honey that dripped from the chicken and onto the mac and cheese was delicious, though.

Our server came shortly her name was Courtney. Keep in mind this is not our first time coming to applebees and i usually always get the same stuff. I ordered the same drink i've gotten from other applebees (the peach quencher ice tea) . 10 mins go by and we get our drinks. I first noticed my tea looked like my friends regular mango tea. My tea was supposed to come with peach slices. I asked her isnt my tea supposed to come with ""real fruit"" that it states on the menu. She immediately says No. i brushed it off no big deal. Right when we got our drinks my friend places a order for the $14.99 appetizer thing ahead of time while we look over the menu. 15 mins later Me and my friend decide to get the 2 for 25 . Our appetizer was onion rings..please tell me why the onion rings came out before anything. At this time we started eating the onion rings and i notice we didnt have any silverware no napkins and most importantly NO SAUCE?!  Like c'mon mannn just brought us a plate of onion rings?!? Wtf!  Still keeping my cool. Our server payed more attention to other tables beside us. As she walked away i had to yell her name just to ask her to get us some sauce. An hour goes by and still no $14.99 app thing we ordered as soon as we came in. Thought nothing of it. Mistakes happen. Then, our main food comes out. Yet , still no silverware.. i guess we're supposed to get our own? The server walks by and manager walks by and says ""oh i'll go get them some silverware""... didnt kno it was that complicated. The host at the door came by and asked us if we needed refills TWICE! I had to be a little rude and ask ""am i supposed to eat with my hands?!?"" He immediately went and got us some . Even after all that time and our food was cold i still managed to keep calm. I've worked in the food industry for 12years. I kno how it is but c'mon. Show some respect. Treat others how u would want to be treated. So what if youre tired. Get the damn work day finished. Dont halfass it .if it was you or your mother or father in my shoes.. wouldnt u give them the best service and want them to be respected... the server came by ONCE during our meal. Thats when my blood started boiling. I immediately asked for the check . Got the check and i couldnt believe it... never got the appetizer we ordered but we're still getting charged $14.99 for it. At that point i was pissed. The audacity. Told the server she went and checked .. and yes they forgot. Asked me if i still wanted it i said NO! Paid for my stuff and left. This visit really pushed my buttons. Oh and mind the fact that it was someones smartass idea to have a loudass art instructor teach a painting class of 30 people. All i kept hearing was the class. Simply retarded. People are trying to enjoy a nice quiet meal. I just want to say to these young servers ... GROW UP! DO YOUR JOB! Doesnt matter what kinda job , do your best!

3,Donald W.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,4.0,2017-12-26,"This Applebee's staff is always an issue.  The 1st waitress with green hair forgot about us.  After 30 minutes we asked her when she would be available for us to order our appetizers and drinks.  She said ""it takes her a long time to find things in the computer.""  Finally, we were given a different waitress (Meeka).  She was great!  The food sucks, the drinks were weak as well.   The manager was hiding in the back somewhere.  He/she never came out to see how things were going.  Won't go back for a while.  Hopefully, they'll get enough complaints to get the ownership to make changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
2,Sarah M.,"Laurel, MD",217,79,10.0,1.0,2017-12-31,Help me now. One and done. Never ever again. I came for $1 long islands. Served out of Lowe's igloo counters by a bartender with his entire butt hanging out and boxers showing. Also the bar is filthy fruit flies flying and the fruit tray is so sticky. I don't think this place has seen a deep clean in at least 6 months. Followed by a sewage leak and smell in the bathroom that would make You puke... which they solved by spraying perfume. Asked to speak to the manager which isn't here today no floor manager no kitchen manager literally no management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-7,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
