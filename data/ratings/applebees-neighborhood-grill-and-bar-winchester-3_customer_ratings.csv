11,Senior P.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,16,16.0,1.0,2012-08-26,"We usually visit Applebee's once per year, when we are in the Clark County, Kentucky area, as it is one of the few dining options in the area that has a bar.  Otherwise, this is not the type of place we'd frequent. The only reason we're writing this review is to express our intense irritation about this national chain's current menu.  At present, the only items on the menu that are vegetarian are fried appetizers such as cheese sticks and potato ""twisters"" (chips), spinach artichoke dip, and tomato-basil soup (note: even the entree *salads* all have meat on them).     It is unacceptable that Applebee's doesn't even have one entree option for vegetarians.  There used to be a spinach flatbread pizza option, but it is gone.  This is nuts, because even places like Burger King and Buffalo Wild Wings (other stops we frequent on our yearly trek to the midlands) have vegetarian options (BK has a gardenburger and BWW has a gardenburger, a black bean burger). There is no reason why this chain can't have a bleeping package of garden or boca burgers in the freezer so a diner can substitute it for a meat patty.   On a side note, the servers might not want to laugh when diners inquire about vegetarian options.  Our server also suggested that we simply order, for instance, a salad without meat.  We refuse to pay anywhere from 10-12 dollars for a salad comprised mainly of iceberg lettuce.

7,Chad C.,"Lexington, KY",425,823,1603.0,3.0,2013-07-03,"I have been here many times and every time received good service.  The atmosphere is nice, but the times I have been in there extremely loud.  The staff are very pleasant and helpful with recommendations on menu items.    I usually test them to see if they have recommendations and half of the time in places the wait staff are stumped at that.  It would seem that is one of the first things they learn during training, but I guess not.  Either way...I usually go with the waiters recommendation.   It is an enjoyable, clean, and family friendly place to have a  sit down meal.  They have a full bar also if you prefer to drink your dinner.   I enjoy their 99 cent desert shooters as well.  mmmmm brownie bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
16,Michael F.,"Helotes, TX",10,25,2.0,5.0,2014-05-04,I have to update this review.  They have come a long way.  Last 3 visits were top notch in food and service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,

12,Danny W.,"Portland, OR",83,124,15.0,3.0,2014-12-02,Pretty good food. Definitely nothing special but it was good for a chain restaurant. The waitress was attentive without interrupting which was nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
17,Scott C.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,21,11.0,1.0,2015-05-11,"Walked in and stood at the hostess station and was looked at by about every employee in the place, finally after about 5 mins the hostess showed up to seat us.  After we were seated the waitress came up and did the drinks then the food order. Got the drinks very timely but the food took 30 mins to get after ordering. Once the food came we were not checked on until my wife asked for a to go box. I ordered the triple bacon burger, was not worth $11.  There was supposed to be a sauce on the burger and they didn't put it on, thank goodness I asked for the lettuce, pickle, and onion. Was about the driest burger I could choke down. The other orders were ok, not worth the wait for somewhat ok food. Probably won't be back to this location again. Very disappointed in the service and the food at this location. I could understand the wait if it was busy, but it was not.  I talked with a manager there about our experience at her location. When I told her about the service and the food issue she really didn't seem to care and that I was bothering her. Not sure if she was a main manager but her lack of people skills and not much caring about the operation of her location was to say the least a shock. Most places seem to care about your experience at their establishment. On a later note, have been up most of the night with stomach cramping, not sure if it was from the food here but was fine until I visited this place. Definitely will not go back, may try another location. Usually have great service and food at Applebee's but this location is the exception.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
13,Karen M.,"Buckhannon, WV",0,23,,2.0,2015-05-17,"The food is never similar to what is presented in the menu pictures. Typical fare for a chain restaurant. Very limited vegetarian options. In an effort to improve this, I contacted corporate. In a very thoughtful, long email I was informed that I could order any chicken dish without chicken. Any beef dish without beef, etc.  Not being interested in carbs, carbs, and more carbs, I have not been back. Put a veggie burger on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
10,James D.,"Winchester, KY",0,5,,2.0,2015-07-08,"The food choice and quality has gone steadily downhill  over the past couple of years. What used to be a menu of good value dinner items, prepared by competent chef's and cooks has now become mainly 'bar food' of inconsistent quality and showing the skill of minimally experienced line cooks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
8,Jim N.,"Winchester, KY",22,498,13.0,4.0,2015-10-09,"What a pleasant surprise! The kids wanted to go here for dinner and we had a great experience. We had chicken, Thai shrimp, ribs, burgers, and the Bourbon steak (one of the better steaks I've had this year!), plus desserts. Everything was tasty, cooked perfectly, and served with a smile....prices were reasonable too. We'll definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
3,Travis B.,"Lexington, KY",26,15,28.0,2.0,2016-12-20,"Always the same experience with there food. Great service tonight, horrible order to table times, and once it got there it was cold basic bacon burger And fries that was extremely bland. This place never can find a decent and consistent cooking staff. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars was because of the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
6,Jennifer S.,"Winchester, KY",4,14,,1.0,2017-01-02,"Went here on a week night, not a Friday. We were able to park right out front. There were two of us. We looked around and there were lots of empty tables. We were told we would have to wait a few minutes, we asked, ""Just a few?"" The hostess replied we would be waiting at least 20 minutes. We left. Can't attest to the food. We just weren't willing to sit and wait while looking at lots of empty tables. Poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
4,Joseph E.,"Monroe, MI",17,4,,4.0,2017-01-17,Applebee's invited us back to make things right and the service could not have been better. They apologized and did not make excuses for what happened.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
2,Anthony K.,"Irvine, KY",35,3,,5.0,2017-04-27,"Went to this place because it was close to the Clark Regional Medical Center. Waitress was extremely helpful and friendly (Jodi). She made sure that we never ran out of drinks. And our order to eating time was very quick. I very much would recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially if you need food while a loved one is in their hospital (only .4 miles from Clark Regional Medical Center).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
1,Jay S.,"Lexington, KY",26,26,13.0,2.0,2017-04-30,"So far, I am unimpressed. Fifteen minutes after ordering drinks, (a peach margarita and a pitcher of beer) my party and I were still waiting. Meanwhile, the bartender is far too busy on her cell phone to accommodate our order.  The water and un-sweet tea did, however; arrive within minutes.  OK, WOW! Food finally arrived. My friend and I both ordered the New Spinach Artichoke Cavatappi . This dish is literally spinach artichoke dip dumped atop a plate of noodles. Another member of my party orders the Fiesta lime chicken which came undercooked and cold in the middle. The dish was sent back where it was obviously microwaved. This was apparent once she tasted the rice that is now tough and chewy. My wife ordered the three cheese cavatappi which was tasteless for lack of a better description. This meal was a total disaster. I give this place two stars because Our waitress, Sandy, was great and the manager apologized and comped our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
5,Joshua B.,"Lexington, KY",18,93,24.0,2.0,2017-05-10,"After much debate my wife and I decided that on our first date night in over a year that we would stay in winchester and not venture to Lexington and just have dinner and see a movie closer to home. Needless to say that was a mistake.  We got to Applebee's with over a hour and a half to spare before our movie started.. After sitting and waiting for well over 15 minutes the waitress  shows up and was extremely rude because she was mad the hostess opened up the booth searing section after she had closed it down or something of that nature and of course it was our fault that she had to get up and do her job... But anyways, I wasn't all that hungry so I just got a simple Mt Dew and a order of boneless wings with the sauce on the side along with both ranch and blue cheese dressing as my wife likes one and I the other. My wife was obviously complicated and ordered a Blue Hawaiian Long Island Ice tea and got the brisket tacos without Pico. See what I mean, that's a extremely complicated order.....  (I got carried away here and forgot to mention that  we waited over another 20 minutes between ordering our drinks and ordering our food. I sat and watched as my wife's drink sat on the bar for well over 15 minutes  before the bartender actually got our waitress to deliver it to us..) Well once the food finally arrived my wings were cold and could have broken a window they where so hard not to mention I didn't receive the ranch nor blue cheese. Fearing it would end up taking another 20-30 minutes to receive my spit covered replacement wings I kept my mouth shut and just got over it. My wife got her food and I must say they looked Amazing!! They had been cooked perfectly,  put together by someone who took pride in what they do only to be ruined by our wonderful waitress whom left them sitting so long the tortilla had become to hard to eat.... She did manage to eat the fries after the hostess took it upon her self to check on us after my empty drink sat on the table for who knows how long and she brought me a fresh drink and my wife some ketchup and mayo... She herself even made a comment that our non existent waitress had ""obviously forgotten about us""..... So after basically having to chase her down to get our check and pay (yes I was nice for some reason and left her a 5 dollar tip, she may have sucked but I'm still not going to be a dick) we finally managed to get to the theater and only miss about 10 minutes of our movie... Do a hour and a half spent getting cold and hard food, no refills, treated like a horrible person for making someone do the job they agreed to do and a little making fun of a guy at the bar who I kid you not didn't stop talking to a girl beside him the entire time we sat there lol. She honestly may have got to say 10 words back to him lol. I could just about bet a second date isn't gonna happen lol! But anyways I recommend if you have somewhere to be then don't take the chance on getting this girl as your waitress as you'll more than likely be late lol! !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
0,Michael M.,"Paris, KY",1,21,,4.0,2017-12-10,"I travel for my work quite a bit, and the Winchester Location is by far my favorite Applebee's. I eat dinner at this location with my family about 5-6 a year for several reasons. First, they do a superb job recognizing Veterans Day. Second, it is always clean. Third, the wait staff is very friendly. And finally, the food is consistently good. Service can sometimes be slightly slow, but I think that is across the board at all Applebee's locations. But if you are willing to relax and enjoy some time with others, this location can't be beat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-winchester-3,,,,,
