There are written tests and multiple shadow shifts.<br>-Our restaurant staffs way too many employees at times when they're not needed and as such, it's difficult for us to pay our bills.<br>-The High 5 Hospitality (sort of like a fancy code of fun rules) says on rule #2 that CPK wants you to be who you (really) are. And yes, the word ""really"" is in parentheses. The problem is that this only applies to some people. Tattoos are okay, crazy colored hair is okay, but piercings are not. This is hypocritical. It allows some people to be who they (really) are and not others.

On my first solo shift, I was giving a 5 top on a busy night. As expected, I wasn't able to keep up so well. At the end of the night, I asked to only have 4 tops for just a short while and the on shift manager happily agreed. I've had two more solo shifts since and I've had 5 tops both nights. For a company so focused on customer service and service details, there's a huge lack of awareness of what's possible for a newbie to the restaurant to even do.","If employees were treated as well as customers, this job would be awesome. It's too difficult to pay my bills with this job-even if I get tipped 20 percent with every bill. There are too many employees scheduled at a time and it's costing all of us money. We're all hurting financially. I'm still very new at this job and even with serving experience, it's crazy to give my a 5 top on my first solo shift. That makes no sense! For a company so utterly focused on top notch customer service, it must be clear that it's nearly impossible for a new hire to serve 5 tables on a busy night with great service details and a smile. A person needs at least a shift or two to adjust to four tables.<br><br>Also, the High 5 Hospitality is hypocritical. I'm sorry to say it, but it is. #2 on the list says that CPK wants employees to be who we (really) are. But this seems to only apply to some people.

Better than working retail (but that is almost any job in my opinion).<br>2.) Your co-workers (that is, only the people on the exact same level as you) generally are friendly and help you when you ask.<br>3.) The company somewhat tries to establish a culture about working there.<br>4.) When I worked there, the dress code was pretty easy and fair. I heard it's gotten much more picky at the expense of the employees since I left though.","Disclaimer: What I am about to share are a number of reasons why I personally feel this company is a bad employer. Not everyone will have the same experiences as me, but you should be aware of what I experienced. This is not meant as a rant.<br><br>1.) Your pay is awful, even though they claim it's ""competitive."" In fact, I had my pay slashed by dollars per hour while working there. They felt that, as a tipped employee, I no longer needed my fixed hourly wage (the state minimum wage), and that my tips plus a menial wage of $4-6/hour would cover the difference. You could get paid WAY better somewhere else, don’t let them stop you from looking as I did MANY times.<br><br>2.) You will sign both an at-will employment agreement and an arbitration agreement - multiple times. I had to sign many legal papers twice while employed there, and there were at least 10-15 pages of legalese between all of the forms I signed (there were others in addition to the aforementioned two). Essentially, this company feels that it's acceptable to fire you whenever they want, and for whatever reason (or no reason) they want. Also, forget about a trial by jury when your life goes bottoms up because you've lost your job for no reason, because you either waive that right or don't keep your job at CPK. Do YOU want that kind of job security?<br><br>3.) No sick days, no vacation days. Unless you're in management, don't think about getting a paid sick or vacation day. Ever. I never was offered one, nor was anyone I know that wasn't a manager of some sort unless you count company contests that they conducted. The people who won those were probably the only non-management that got vacation days, and to my recollection none of them worked with me.<br><br>4.) Favoritism. You'll hear this complaint a lot with many businesses, but my managers played favorites over the most immature stuff. Yes, the managers do try to form relationships with underlings outside of work (see below), which is EXTREMELY unprofessional and explains why the favoritism exists. I have seen multiple times managers keep servers in the WORST sections of the restaurant over and over, while other managers put some servers in the BEST sections of the restaurant every single time. There was at least one server who quit because they would always get the same awful section every day (maybe they got lucky if the manager who made the floor plan thought they were hot), and I can tell you that it was one of the hardest sections to sit. Also, expect to get disciplined while others don’t despite doing the same thing. That happened CONSTANTLY.<br><br>5.) Unprofessional staff rampant. Managers sleep with servers, servers sleep with servers, people seek blatantly unprofessional relationships and make sure to bring it up in front of guests. This has been just SOME of my experience, but I feel that it was a pretty big problem that the general manager (GM) and assistant general manager (AGM) either weren't competent enough to pick up on the relationships (they also both had outside relationships with certain individuals in question) or just blatantly disregarded their existence, not sure what happened there.<br><br>6.) Advancement doesn't exist. They say they promote from within. Don't believe it if you hear it, unless you define promotion as going from being a host to being a server. If you wan't professional advancement, look for a job with the corporate office or their call center, but I wouldn’t expect much if any professional advancement without a degree, pure dumb luck, or both.<br><br>7.) Scheduling is awful. I wish I could take a picture of my HotSchedules (scheduling app) app on my iPhone as proof. They literally block you from taking anything that MIGHT be a busy day months in advance. No joke. They blocked Black Friday in 2013 almost a year before (I still had access then). Then they blocked Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Patriot’s Day, and any major or minor holiday from being asked for off MONTHS in advance. That also includes any vacation days the local schools might be having because little kids might come in with their families (it's a family restaurant). My scheduling manager made asking for days off extremely stressful. If you are a student, I HIGHLY advise you not work for this company.","Stop caring about the bottom line and start caring about the hosts, take-out servers, counter servers and general servers that are the reason you actually make money.

In the past few months, emphasis on service has degenerated to an emphasis on hard sales. New server reviews are formulated by PPA's or per person average. This isn't calculated by the amount of sales divided by the amount of guests. It is calculated as a point system that punishes the server if your items have low points. For example, if you have a family with two kids meals, those kids meals are worth less than one adult plain cheese pizza. Server sections are designated based on their PPA's as well as scheduling.<br><br>We used to be allowed shift meals if we were scheduled to work a double shift (am and pm shift combined) but now we are not. On top of that, we aren't allowed to order food while on the clock nor allowed to take our leftovers home if we do order a meal. If we want to take anything home, we have to pay full cost. This is problematic from an affordability stand point but also that if you are working 11am to 10pm, you can't order food until you're off the clock. However, you also can't order food too late before closing time either. So you have to hope you're tables are finished, your side work is done, and you're off the clock at least an hour before closing time. If you are lucky enough to order food, you can't box the leftovers, but are required to throw the food away. We also have an increasingly limited selection of what we are allowed to order off the menu.<br><br>Labor hours are calculated based on a complicated formula that is inconsistent with the realities of a day. For example, say there is constant growth in sales from 12pm until 2pm because of the lunch rush. However, sales and labor hours are monitored and the upper management will reprimand managers because there are still staff on the clock after 2:30. It doesn't take into account that we're not herding guests out the door, to allow the server to get off the clock. There should be more time allotted, more flexibility.<br><br>Lastly, this week we found out that hourly employees, not sure if that includes back of the house, but bussers, hosts, and bartenders are having their wages reduced to minimum wage. This is regardless of their tenure or pay. For example, staff members who received $10 an hour or have been with the company for 15 years are as of immediately, receiving reduced wages to $7.25 an hour. It was an extreme shock.<br><br>On top of all this, staff are being berated if they have too many work hours. I don't mean overtime, I mean that if they work 20 hours a week, and other employees release their shifts to be picked up, and another employee picks up those shifts, increasing their work hours to 30 or more, they get hassled. This is because if they maintain 25 hours or more a week, they qualify for insurance and an annual ""bonus"" of about $150 (depending on tenure). If they average less than 25 (for lower bonus or insurance qualifications) or 30 hours, they are disqualified or lose their eligibility.<br><br>Changes to the menu, serving portions, cups, cutlery, plates, napkins, etc, have all been replaced with cheaper, smaller items, to allow for less portioning out and reduced costs and most importantly: increased profit. I have had many guest complaints because as they said, things ""now feel cheapened"".<br><br>The company is being squeezed dry for profit at every turn and what was once a great company to work for, with great guests, is now feeling morally depleted and a lack of morale shows.","To store managers, I feel sorry for you because i know how much you are being pressured literally hourly, with requests for updates, reports, action plans, and overall corrective measures to increase profit.<br><br>To the upper management: you are killing the company.

Section sizes are decreasing (a good thing! I'm used to 8-12 table sections) and new uniforms are being released.,"Once the dust settles, we'll see which cons still remain. The managers are overworked and underpaid--the usual restaurant crap.",Calm down. I've seen managers do some really nasty and illegal things over the years and corporate never does anything.

That shouldn't be happening."
"""Decent money, bad management""",2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0," Jul 18, 2012",Past,Server,"Newark, DE",No,No,Neutral,Part-time,Less than a year,Better than making minimum wage,"Management plays favorites, super unprofessional, will change someone's schedule so they miss a shift and then fire them, writes people up for small things like not filling a salt shaker. No appreciation for work done. We had the worst numbers in our region, I believe due to management issues.","Grow up... this isn't high school. There was one good manager that listened to employee's issues, and the kitchen manager was professional. But most of the management was outwardly rude to employees that they didn't like and would find small reasons to let people go."
"""Same social dynamic as a middle school; if you weren't part of the right clique you were doomed to fail.""",1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0," Jul 31, 2012",Past,Server,"Scarsdale, NY",No,Neutral,Yes,Part-time,Less than a year,"The money is fantastic. Paid very low hourly, but you get to keep nearly all of your tips (just pay some out to the cooks and the hostess).","You are expected to pay for everything you need. The uniforms are very specific and you are not given an allowance or anything. You have to buy all your own shirts, pants, shoes, etc. The dissonance between management and servers is also far too much.","I see a job as something professional. I did not share personal information unless asked specifically (so a non-answer would be awkward), yet I was reprimanded for how I felt about kids. in any other situation or with other people it would be a non-issue. But managers have far too much leeway and if they have a personal opinion about you that is negative, it affects how they treat you. My advice? train your managers to be more professional."
"""Fun place to work, don't get stuck.""",5.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,," Aug 2, 2009",Past,Server,"Chandler, AZ",Yes,Neutral,Neutral,Part-time,,"California Pizza Kitchen hired me with minimal experienced and gave me pretty extensive training. I made decent money and the food is good, however most of the people there were in college and we didn't take it too seriously. As long as you take it for what it is, it'll be the best time of your life, and there is a pretty close group of servers, at least at my restaurant.",My restaurant didn't have a very good employee meal programs but that varies between stores. Be wary of lifers and people who take their job too seriously otherwise it'll be fun.,Take the job a little less seriously and give servers a little bit more room.

They were willing to help me out if I helped them. Many of them were in similar life situations (just graduated college, trying to get a job). I made a lot of good friends.","Management often rewards the people that ""sell"" according to their Steps of Service rather than the people that turn tables quickly with satisfied customers. Often, the servers who did the Steps of Service had others running their food and filling their tables' drinks, as the customers weren't well attended to. These folks tended to get swamped, because they were good salesmen, but poor service professionals. I think rewarding servers on their overall sales for the evening would be a better goal. Also, the location I worked at didn't have very many customers - management should have looked into more effective customer acquisition strategies.",Concentrate on the customer.
"""CPK is a great place to work, dealing with cheap customers?

The number one rule is ""Make CPK a great place to work"" and it is.","As a server your income is mainly tips, you must depend on the public to tip you. Most tip 15-20%, but some don't (especially in this economy). When the company runs a promotion, giving the customer a discount, your tips go down. People don't tip on the original total and the company doesn't reccomend or suggest that they do. The servers have a problem with that. Other restaurents inform customers that gratuity isn't included in promotions.","Every promotion should clearly state gratuity isn't included. Restaurant.com coupons clearly state ""Please remember to tip you server on the full value of the guest check.""<br><br>Strong servers and/or servers with seniority should be given a raise in their hourly wage as well."

They hired a really great bunch of people.","Management. They drink on the job, are unapproachable, blame the staff for anything and everything, break their own contract rules (no eating upstairs but they eat upstairs), they didnt pay us for the first 4 weeks we worked there, they dont pay their accounts for their bar suppliers so were always out of stuff, dont give proper training cuz they dont know what they're doing themselves but will be the first to blame all the other staff, dont support their staff in any way possible or give them any benefits (not even free food after making them work long hours), for the first 3 weeks of opening nobody got any breaks.",Don't open up the second store just because your contract says you have to when you cant even handle one store
