10,Lisa B.,"Bronx, NY",17,70,7.0,4.0,2012-11-09,I really like this place and probably the only Applebee's I've only like. Food is good and the service at the bar is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yonkers-6?start=40,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000005
44,Jimmy C.,"Yonkers, NY",2,36,199.0,3.0,2012-11-26,"I think they are doing better here.  I had a basically good experience on ""Black Friday."" Although I got a table quickly, the place filled up rapidly after that. This restaurant is almost ALWAYS busy, and half the staff & customers often seemed pissed off, 'cause it's in the shopping center and it's kinda small and it's noisy. The service was good. You have to be prepared for many different waiters, like, surprising you with the different parts of your meal, but, other than that, you should be okay. My bloody Mary ($7.15) was VERY good. The nachos were a good deal at $5.25. The chicken with portobello mushrooms and 'taters ($10) and steak with parmesan shrimp and garlic mashies ($22) were basically good.  But I later noticed that my cup of coffee was $3! Yikes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yonkers-6?start=20,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001,1.6440000000000001
52,Beth R.,"Astoria, NY",155,114,2.0,1.0,2013-03-27,"Atrocious service. Sat at the bar for lunch on Saturday. There was only one bartender; she could barely keep up with the drink orders for the wait staff (for their tables), much less provide us with adequate service, despite the fact that she was quick. She appeared to be the only employee doing any work in the packed establishment. It was March Madness, with 2 NCAA basketball games being televised at the time, and yet neither was being shown on any of the ~10 sets in the bar. But CNN without closed captioning was on one, some random minor league soccer summary was on another, and the NIT basketball game was on all 4 sets behind the bar. I ordered a SkinnyBee margarita. It is tiny, too sweet, not fresh tasting and overpriced. Next I ordered a vodka soda. One sip revealed there was no carbonation in the soda. I understand there are often mechanical problems in bars/restaurants. But it took about 10 minutes to get the bartender's attention to notify her. She made me a new drink using a different soda line, and it was fine. I ordered the Zesty Roma Chicken & Shrimp, which was actually quite tasty, especially considering it is under 550 calories, but then again I was starving by the time it actually arrived. Oh, and then I had to stare at and smell it for over 5 minutes without silverware; I couldn't get the attention of the bartender or even any of the employees as they passed by! My friend finally just got up and grabbed a set for me from the end of the bar. I was surprised the food was lukewarm (and not completely cold) by that point. No one ever followed up with me to ask how the food was. By the time we finally got the bartender's attention again, we requested the check, didn't argue that there was no comp on my botched vodka soda and left as fast as we could. Applebee's, there are a lot of people looking for work in this economy. You should be able to find and hire some people who actually WANT to work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yonkers-6?start=20,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003

The service was not exemplary, but it wasn't bad either, contrary to most reviews.  Ordered the Mozzarella sticks and Creamy Chicken Parmesan. The chicken was not as hot as I would have hoped, but other than that, the taste was pretty good. However, the quantity is not worth the high prices. I was probably 30% less hungry than I was when I walked in but that was about it. Overall, I don't think I'll be going there again.

The waitress took about 10 minutes to come to our table, seemed distracted taking our orders, didnt bring the drinks until 5 minutes after taking our food order. I guess I didnt expect such slow service when the place wasnt even packed. The wait staff definitely needs training. While we were waiting, one dropped 2 plates of food from another table and when our food was brought out, the guy handed it to us on the opposite side of the table so we had to reach over the kids to get it. He could have easily taken a few more steps to go around to our side. Thank God it didnt fall on top of them since the plates were extremely hot and I burned my finger grabbing it. Highly doubt I will come here again.

Because of the convenience of its location and huge parking lot, my boyfriend, his daughter, his sister and I decided to go there to eat. I rather like Applebee's and was excited to order chicken wontons. We got there and were sat super quickly. I told the hostess that we would need a high chair and one was delivered right away. We were placed in the bar area which seemed strange because we had a baby but it was a good size booth so we mad due.  Then we waited...and waited. It took another ten minutes for a waiter to come over and introduce herself. By this time, I had already hopped on yelp and checked in. And when I did I wanted to get up and leave. The reviews were horrible. All about long waits and poor service. This was not looking good.  JJ was our waitress friendly but she didn't tell us or offer us any specials. I do not like that at all. I still to this day don't know if there were specials going on that night. WE were going to ask her when she came back to check on us but because she took so long, we forgot.  We started off ordering beverages. When my boyfriend asked her about the type of whiskeys they had she only could name Jack Daniels. I do not understand. And instead of saying that she would go check, she stood there. Ok we'll move on them. We ordered a jack and diet coke, blue moon, coca cola and pineapple juice. Ten minutes later, the drinks started to come. No they didn't come all at once. They came one at a time. With minutes in between each delivery.  Not a fan. Thank goodness we ordered our food with our beverages because we really didn't see JJ again for another 15 minutes. By that time I had to flag someone else over for silverware. We ordered boneless buffalo wings, plain wings with oney mustard, mozzarella sticks, hot wings, and a steak dinner (medium well). We said to bring out all the apps and then the steak right away (because we knew that would take longer). And it did...take longer. I'm sure she forgot about.  The wings orders were wrong and needed to be fixed. The steak was more medium than medium well but my boyfriend was so hungry he ate what he could and left it. We all pretty much left the food there. No one was thrilled with their order. The reviews are right. This place is not the place to go.

38,Barbara R.,"Yonkers, NY",25,11,,1.0,2016-09-27,"I found out that Applebees is franchised out and corporate doesn't give a rats ass what individual owners are doing with their Applebees. It's really a gross place, and we will not go there again. The waitress said, ""Yo I'll hook you up with the bartender, how low life is that? The poor Asian kid, the other server couldn't get hooked up with the bartender, awe, we felt bad for him. We saw enough, we'll find somewhere else to go that we don't have to get hooked up. I think that is so low life. I think, if I come to a bar restaurant during Happy Hour, and the server has to tell me that they'll hook me up, I'm done. It's Happy Hour we should be ""hooked up"" automatically. Honestly, the people that work at Applebees should have some control and self respect? I think proper ethic training would help. This is complete ""Poor Management."" You walk in these restaurants today and you have to be prepared to walk out and go home and cook and make your own cocktails. The world has become a cesspool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yonkers-6?start=20,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002

34,Fordmustanglover 2.,"New York, NY",0,39,129.0,3.0,2016-10-16,A very nice Applebee's. Not too shabby. A little bit on the expensive side but the food is very good. The food took 15 minutes to come out but it's ok. The bathrooms do smell bad like a dirty ocean and the sinks are all messed up but its because they are renovating the bathrooms. Other than that a very nice experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yonkers-6,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

19,Steve M.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,5.0,1.0,2017-05-29,"Bad even for applebees. Inattentive staff. An old man fell right in front of the greeting staff and they just looked at him. They didn't even walk over the one foot where he fell from them. Patrons were the ones who assisted helping the elderly gentleman to his feet and walking him to his table.  Food- order was wrong. The waitress stated that we ordered four meals when there was ONLY 3 PEOPLE sitting at the table, insisting that we ordered two sirloin stir fry meals (in retrospect I wished I ordered zero.) Hmmmm. Then they also tried to partially charge us for the additional meal, insisting that their math was more accurate than my wife's (who has a PhD)!

28,Lisa S.,"Yonkers, NY",1,10,,1.0,2017-06-23,My mom took my kids here to celebrate them have a great school year and well lets just say she should've taken them else where! The wait was well over 45 minutes without so much as an apology or explanation! When they were FINALLY seated the server took another 15 to come and ask for their drink order she tried to give our order at the same time and the server said I can only do one thing at a time! :O! Ya I know it just kept getting better! The ONLY reason they didn't leave is because the kids all had swim class later so they didn't have time to go anywhere else but WE will NEVER be going back to that Applebee's! We have enjoyed lunch here before but that was in the middle of a work day when it wasn't so busy. You would think that at the beginning of the summer season these people would have their game faces on well THEY DON'T!!! So unless you have PLENTY of time to wait DO NOT GO TO APPLEBEE'S in Cross County!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yonkers-6,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002

Done perfectly as we requested.    Had the Wednesday- special Apple Sangria- large goblet.  Very tasty.  Food served in a timely manner.   Would have been 5 Stars except for these 2 comments.  The carpets need cleaning, noticed order upon entering.
