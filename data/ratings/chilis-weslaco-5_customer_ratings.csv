7,Adolfo Z.,"McAllen, TX",11,20,,1.0,2016-06-24,"I have eaten at several Chili's and this location is by far sub par.  The service was extremely slow.  We did not all get put food as the same time.  By the time we were finished four of us were finished, the fifth person was barely getting their meal.  Sitting at the table must have been awkward being the only person eating.  I know it was awkward for us to see that person eat.  When you go out to eat as a family you expect everyone to be served at the same time or relatively at the same time but this was unacceptable.  We had to go and ask for silverware and I had to choke down my meal because I never received a refill on my drink.  After we ALL finished our meal and were set to pay, we asked about the veteran discount.  To our surprise we were informed that they did not offer a discount for veterans.  This was the first Chili's location in the state of Texas that does not acknowledge veterans.  My father-in-law and I are Marine veterans and we can say without hesitation that we will not be eating at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-weslaco-5,,,,,
2,Jaime L.,"Weslaco, TX",9,41,,5.0,2017-01-09,"Came here Saturday after work, and the staff was extremely friendly. Our waiter had a down-to-earth attitude, and it made the experience even better. The food can be kind of hit your wallet, but the taste is worth whatever you spend. As a bonus, the Molten Lava Chocolate Cake comes out as the cherry on top of a really good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-weslaco-5,,,,,
1,John S.,"Edmond, OK",0,94,14.0,3.0,2017-02-01,We went to chilies last night.  We had the small sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  We also had a small side salad.  We enjoyed the meal very much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-weslaco-5,,,,,
3,Murdoc K.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,43,9.0,1.0,2017-02-01,"Good gawd... stay away from the country fried steak. Shit was horrible. I couldn't even eat it. I tried. I took a few bites, chewed, chewed, chewed, the ""meat"" just clumped up and had a rubber texture. Seriously. Take a rubber band chew on it, that's how it felt chewing the ""meat."" I say ""meat"" cause I've never ever had meat like that. Can't believe I paid for that. My plate looked untouched almost. I just nibble at the corn and mashed potatoes. They were okay tasting, but I was over it and wanted to leave. I'm going to get a gourmet burger from McDonalds, compared to this junk.  Service was just ok. I ate at the bar. Service would probably get a 3 star.  I was going to average them out and give a 2 star review, but changed my mind. As I was typing the food was way too disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-weslaco-5,,,,,
4,Vanessa C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",56,1,,4.0,2017-02-27,"I loved being able to be on the waitlist, arrived with my guest and was accurate. The meal I ordered wasn't filled like the previous times I ordered. And the waitress forgot our appetizer before our entrees. Other than that it was great being able to use Yelp to reserve our table :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-weslaco-5,,,,,
6,Criste G.,"Weslaco, TX",0,28,5.0,5.0,2017-05-17,"Took my parents out to dinner and was hesitant about ordering a cosmopolitan done the old fashioned way..sweet with the original Skyy Vodka, not those new trendy ones, and a shot of Contreau with a twist of lime.  Mariana the part time weekend bartender knew exactly how to prepare this cosmopolitan! She said she wanted to see who ordered the martini made like in the old series Sex and the City!  Alas yes, I am of a certain age!  My parents always get a window table, the food perfect, the service great and if you are there Thursday through Sunday ask if Mariana is the bartender!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-weslaco-5,,,,,
5,Santos H.,"Weslaco, TX",15,1,,1.0,2017-07-22,Came today with my family place was not packed a lot of empty seats. Sat dor 10 minutes before they even came to take our drinks. Waitress was busy talking to a customer she knew and all others were chatting in the back. Never got offered a refill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-weslaco-5,,,,,
