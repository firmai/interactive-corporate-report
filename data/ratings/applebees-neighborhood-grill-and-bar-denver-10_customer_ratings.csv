2,Sarah V.,"Denver, CO",234,299,57.0,2.0,2013-07-22,"I haven't been to an Applebee's in a few years, but I got a couple of gift cards and decided to stop in for a family dinner. We ordered 2 kids meals and 3 adult meals with 2 appetizers.  For dinner I got the grilled cheese (it has a fancier name), and it was very good for a grilled cheese. My daughter got the three cheese chicken penne and it was decent, a bit lacking in flavor but edible. The appetizers were probably the best part, we got a cheese dip and also fried cheese sticks, they were both exactly what you would expect.  The total for the food that we got was almost $75!!! Like I've told you before, I am not a cheap skate or anything but wowza, 75 bucks for some less than great food? That's a lot. We could have gone to another place where the food is amazing and eaten for $10-$15 per plate and enjoyed it a heck of a lot more! I'd say that for these prices, you may as well hit up some place better, it's my pet-peeve that people choose these ""cheaper"" restaurants when really they end up costing almost the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

19,J H.,"Denver, CO",5,6,,1.0,2014-02-19,We have been here a few times and for the most part enjoyed the food and this last time was no exception. So the reason I'm only giving this place a one star is because we were celebrating my husbands birthday there and he had received a birthday card from his parents. He didn't get a chance to open his card during dinner and as soon as we were out the door he remembered that he left it in the table. He went right back in and found that it was already gone along with our plates that had been cleared. We asked our waitress if she had picked it up and had also ask the other staff if they had picked it up of corse no one admitted to it. We also asked if perhaps it had been picked up on accident and thrown in the trash and they said they looked and didn't see it. We also asked the one table that had anyone near us while we were dining and they said they didn't see it. It's not very likely that any other diners took it. We found out that the gift in the card was a pretty awesome gift.  We are really disappointed in this restaurant.  And will not be back. My advice is don't leave anything there and expect to ever see it again. :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

The staff friendly and understood my problems with being in public with my Autistic boy and accommodated us.

1,Paul B.,"Denver, CO",1,5,1.0,2.0,2015-04-03,"I don't expect too much from Applebee 's but this store seems to have a ""don't give a damn"" attitude from the service to the food to the management. The server was polite but only marginally attentive and when it became clear that we weren't going to be a big ticket, her interest faltered. The pretzel rods and cheese was the highlight. The meatballs were mealy and cold.  The other items were bland.

39,Brett I.,"Greenville, SC",2,22,22.0,2.0,2015-04-08,"On a Wednesday night, my Family of 4 chose Applebee's with two other friends. What a big disappointment. My kids are 2 and 8 months. Apparently it is to much of a hassle to put us in a section that has been cleaned for the night. They sit us in the bar area..... Two babies and 4 adults. Then we get a waiter who looks like he needs to be somewhere else. After we order waters, he pawns us on someone else, like the ticket wasn't worth any money or his time. Our new waitress is Kayla... She is the only reason I gave it any stars. She rocked. 15 minutes into the dinner, a guy at the bar starts having a loud swearing contest 4 ft away from my kids. We talk to the manager and they calm the mood around the bar. Food was not up to usual. This Applebee's is the place to go drink if you are a real winner and 35.

4,Beau S.,"Westminster, CO",106,3,,1.0,2015-11-24,First I would like to say the staff was amazing. We ordered food to go and did the 2 for $20 deal with a dessert. When I went to pick it up I had to wait an extra 10 minutes because they didn't have it ready. I understand there was a game on and a few people dining however I showed up after the time suggested for me to be there. When I got my food and took it home I found out that I was missing 3 out of the four sides and the appetizer we started with (chips and salsa) tasted very stale. So when I called to ask about getting our sides they apologized and offered to make them fresh. Deal they made the error correct and I was semi happy. So after we ate our meal we decided to enjoy dessert (the 2 chocolate cake thing with ice cream) however we were very unsatisfied with the flavor. I don't even know how to describe the taste it was just terrible. Needless to say I won't be going back to this Applebee's not because of poor service just the poor quality of food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20,,,,,
7,Ladie G.,"Westminster, CO",0,5,,1.0,2015-12-13,"So we went to Applebee's again. This time I was not at all impressed. Seemed like the management had their panties in a bunch, threatening the servers and cooks. My server was great and food came out hot and In a timely manner so I don't know what the problem was. This is the 3rd time I've been to this particular location and every time it seems like the management is on the warpath about something there, just real negative all the time really kills a positive vibe. makes me not wanna go there ever again.  to be witness to the servers getting treated like crap really kind of upsets me because the servers don't get paid anything but tips ,  it makes no sense for them to have to put up with poor management. I don't know Applebees you better get your priorities straight and look into the way your management treats your employees. and of all the Applebees that I've gone to this one has to be one of the worst when it comes to management",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20,,,,,
38,Teresa L.,"Denver, CO",4,33,6.0,1.0,2016-01-23,"Always seems to be some sort of issue when we come here, I don't know why we continue to give chances. This time around we sat at the bar, it took 10 mins for anyone to even acknowledge us, even tho many people had been walking in and out of the bar gossiping to each other. We finally were able to order, we did 3 apps including wings, and artichoke dip. The chips for the dip were all broken up, seriously in small pieces (I would've taken a pic if my phone hadn't died). We requested a ranch and blue cheese for the wings and only got this small thing of ranch and when we asked for blue cheese they gave us a much bigger dish of it with attitude.

0,Melanie S.,"Westminster, CO",0,2,,1.0,2016-02-14,"I get the feeling that most Applebee's customers are not exactly perusing Yelp before making the trip but I feel a review is necessary regardless.  We made the choice to eat here on Valentine's day because it was close to the highway and I had to go to work that night. This is our second visit and probably our last.  The server was very friendly.  The food was very bad.  Period.  The beer took 10 minutes to get to our table.  The soup had some sort of chewy non edible piece of meat.  My salad was dressed incorrectly and the manager actually argued with me about it being correct.  In addition, the salad looked more like a side portion than a 9.99 full salad.  The burger was reasonable but very, very greasy.  Kids meal was ok I suppose but the yogurt looked a little curdled.  I was so dissapointed in the food I spoke to the manager again and he did comp our meal.  That was the right thing to do, but I still feel like I won't be coming back.  I left hungry and upset about the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10?start=20,,,,,
30,Kayla R.,"Thornton, CO",65,43,165.0,4.0,2016-02-22,"The atmosphere of this particular Applebees is chill. I walked in to no host and after about 5 minutes of looking around I just ended up sitting at the bar. I got a glass of their house Pinot Grigio (which was Barefoot) and started of with a bowl of their Tomato and Basil soup. It came out hot and nicely garnished. I didn't mind the texture, however,  it seemed thicker than other tomato soups I've tried. I barely taste the basil. The soup itself was pretty decent, although reminds me of pasta sauce.  For dinner I ordered the new cheeseburger rolls and wonton tacos. My husband got the beer cheese burger and fries.  The cheese burger bites were very crispy and cheesy, I expected more meat, however am over all satisfied. The dipping sauce is great adding a nice hotness to the dish.  The wanton tacos were nice and crispy, however a lot spicier than I remember. The parsley on top was kinda sloppily cut but didn't take away from the flavor.  My husband loved his burger, it was cooked perfectly and looked beautiful. The fries were super crispy and seasoned. He was very satisfied.  Finally I got the most genius dessert, the brownie bite. It was the perfect size and the brownie was warm and was complimented by the Icecream!  The price was good, the food and service was good as well. This particular Applebees is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-denver-10,,,,,
