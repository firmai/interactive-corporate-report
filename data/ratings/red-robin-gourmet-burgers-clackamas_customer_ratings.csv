113,Kami C.,"Clackamas, OR",105,138,21.0,2.0,2012-10-18,"This is my first review typed in FOREVER. So I might as well get the steam rolling now and end with the good ones. So last night on October 17th, 2012 my boyfriend and I went to Red Robin for some dinner after my shift ended at 8pm. We entered and we're greeted within 5 minutes. This meaning the hostess was at the edge of the bar folding stuff and I assume (yes that makes an ass of you and me) she didn't want to use her side vision...however she did apologize so that is a great thing! She seated us and told us our server is Taylor. I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE SAT AT THE BAR .....simply because I think the service would have been outstanding. We each ordered alcohol and water...when we got our water Taylor said he would be back with our drinks....then our appetizers came! Nothing yummier than HOT & FRESH Mozzarella sticks and onion rings....WITHOUT SILVERWARE. Halfway through our apps...we got our drinks. Now doesn't your drink usually come with your water?! Our food was great and was not a problem.  The main things that bothered me were: 1) Umm what happened to ""EXCUSE ME'...as I started to grab my yummy wrap I noticed an arm inches from my nose and a pitcher attached to that arm pouring water. What ever happened to ""Excuse me for reaching over you OR Would you hand me your glass so I can fill it? Usually I am good about handing the glass but I did not see the water pitcher or notice his reach right away. RUDE! 2) I'm used to a midori sour in a short wide glass with little ice. This glass (which I should have taken a picture of) was half the size of a graphing calculator, loaded with ice, and cost me.....$5.29. Dear lordy lordy I basically had a shot of midori sour. 3) Just the overall customer service was not exciting. The worst server I have had there ever. I grew up in Oregon and was gone for 4 years. Came back in May and been to this Red Robin 4 times now and this time was THE WORST.  Never checked on our food, reached over my food to poor a water glass at the other end of the table, and the drink was dinky! Of course....I'll be back...I'll just choose my waiter! The area I hate to sit in (the booths by the bathroom) will be my new spot because those girls and manager know how to provide service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas?start=100,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007
96,Laura C.,"Portland, OR",164,792,140.0,4.0,2012-11-25,"Normally, chain restaurants like RR are not high on my priority list of restaurants, but my co-workers got me to sign up for their birthday club - to get a free birthday burger.  Not that chains don't have good food; but you've been to one RR, you've been to them all. I like originality. However; there's no disputing they make a really, good burger!  Having gotten my free birthday burger email, I decided to use it today after church and split it with my mom. Then my brother decided to tag along. So much for walking out of there without spending a penny (besides tip).  When I arrived, my mom had already been seated. She gushed about how sweet the  waiter was; having brought her a refill of soda without her asking (must be bottomless like the fries??) When our server, Taylor, greeted us, I explained that we were there for my free burger. Instead of giving that surly look some servers give (my guess is they're questioning whether you know to tip on on the entire bill before the discount), Taylor smiled and was all ""Sure! Great. No prob. What can I get for ya?""  Without asking he then brought us our burger, split in half. The cook also divvied up our sweet potato fries. Taylor asked how we liked the meat cooked and like a good server, he took note that we wanted it well done. The chef then followed orders and cooked it well (so often they do not and my meat comes out bloody). The Bleu Ribbon Burger my mom and I split was to die for! I knew I couldn't go wrong when I read the description (""Basted with a tangy steak sauce, topped with crumbled Bleu cheese and crispy onion straws, lettuce, fresh tomatoes and zesty chipotle aioli on an onion bun) and every bite melted in my mouth.  My brother and I got into an argument, so Taylor diffused it with more of each kind of fry (I didn't think we'd asked but it shut us up).  Yes. Not only did we tip on what would be the whole bill, but we gave Taylor 20%. If only every server were the genuinely nice! (I've had mediocre service at RR before, so Taylor brought their 3 star rating up to a 4) I'll be back for sure. This time next year. ha ha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas?start=100,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024

I'm a big fan of this chain for more-than-a-drivethru-experience meals.  Literally every time I've been in, someone else has To Go for a tavern burger. I don't know what that is but people love it.  I love their salads and wraps. Their Avocobbo salad has avocado, bacon, bleu cheese, olives, tomatoes, hard boiled egg and your choice of dressing with a slice of foccacia. Their honey mustard is better than anywhere else's I've tried.  It can definitely get expensive if you order drinks while you wait, I would steer clear of that.

93,Trisha S.,"Austin, TX",1,2,,1.0,2013-09-08,"Very disappointed. Visited this location on Saturday evening around 6:30. Sat at the bar due to too long of a wait for a regular table. One bartender, Kristina, for the entire restaurant (first mistake). Lost our appetizer order (second mistake), onion rings did not arrive until after our burgers and after we complained about not receiving them. Waited 45 minutes for 2 burgers. My burger, which was a Burning love with chicken and sweet potato fries, came out, cold and completely soggy. Almost as if it was a mistake from another order that had been sitting in the window for two long. Even the fried jalapenos, which make the burger, were a soggy mushy mess. I ate the chicken out of one half of the sandwich and left the rest. The bartender asked me if I would like a togo box to take the rest home and I told her, no the sandwich was completely soggy and I couldn't eat it. At which  she said she was sorry and proceeded to get our check without even seeing if we wanted another beer or dessert. It was handled very poorly and after the mess up with our appetizer I didn't want to be ""that"" customer who does nothing but complain. But when you get terrible food and not so good service someone needs to know about to so that maybe it doesn't happen to someone else.

104,Paul P.,"San Jose, CA",1,11,,1.0,2013-12-26,"What happened to Clackamas. I grew up coming to this Red Robin all the time, and I remember the servers being super nice, and the atmosphere in general being very welcoming. My family came here for dinner, and from the moment we walked in, I felt like we were in a completely different area. Once we were seated, our server paid no attention to us. Further, the place was not busy, ad when we asked for a basket of fries, her response: ""I can't guarantee it since we're very busy right now."" For one, who says that? Isn't red robin known for bottomless steak fries? If your establishment is built upon that motto, you better live up to it. Secondly, I took one look around the entire restaurant and I can count many empty tables, so clearly this server did not have a sense of her surroundings.  Once our food came out, it was fine, but I had lost my appetite due to the poor attitude of the server. As we were leaving, and putting on our coats, another waitress said, ""please move along"" while using jan motions pushing us. Wtf?! I was about to give her a piece of my mind.  I don't know what happened here, but this place has just gone down hill like there's no end. The servers act like they are from the trailer parks, and have no proper training in customer service. It's sad that the happy valley area has gotten so ghetto. I blame it on the MAX train system coming in, but that's still no excuse for service at a restaurant to be sub-par.

119,Jason A.,"Portland, OR",57,257,16.0,4.0,2014-11-30,"Getting better, give it a try!!!! I decided to give Red Robin another try after my last review.  They were quick to message me and get more information which I appreciated, and I was able to speak with management which showed their concern and care for their customers.  That goes a long way with this reviewer. I went back with my parents a few nights ago on a Saturday night.  I was very surprised to see the complete remodel.  It looks fantastic.  They've painted, and re-configured their walk in and waiting area, making it customer focused and much quieter.  I never cared for the kids room with games and loud noise. It was busy as expected, and we waited about 15 minutes, which was more than fine with me at dinner time on a busy weekend.  I especially appreciated the young man at the check in keeping an eye out for an empty booth in the bar area, and when one opened they called us over.   Food was very good, and a much better improvement since my last visit.  Service was spot on and very friendly as well.  I ordered my usual veggie burger and we all split an onion ring appetizer which was really nice.  I assumed we'd be waiting a bit for food, but they were able to get things out in plenty of time, and our food was hot. Only negative here was that I had ordered cheese on my burger and didn't come with any.  I knew this was an extra charge which is the norm these days so I brought it to the attention of our waitress.  She apologized and quickly offered to remove the charge from the bill.  I would have appreciated it slightly more if there was an offer to remake my burger, but it wasn't too important so I didn't sweat it.  People get way too upset about little things like that anyway. Red Robin seems to have come a long way in recent months.  Perhaps the expediting could still be a bit better and has a few kinks to work out, but those things are just going to happen in a busy restaurant from time to time. Overall, I'm pleased to see some changes here and I'll be happy to return.  Check this place out and their great new remodel, you'll be pleasantly surprised!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.384,3.3200000000000003

81,K F.,"Portland, OR",0,57,1.0,1.0,2015-05-18,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Yesterday's experience was the most humiliating, mortifying experience I have ever had in a public place. It was my 25th birthday, and my 60 year old parents and I sat in the bar for lunch. I handed the waitress my DMV issued temporary drivers license and expired drivers license for photo ID (I had to renew), and she immediately went to speak with the manager. When she came back, she said the manager refused my ID. I asked to speak with him, and when he came out, he said that he was not trained to accept that form of ID, and I would not be allowed to order alcohol in his restaurant. The ID I presented was just as legal as any other form of ID they had been presented by other patrons at the restaurant. After explaining to him that my ID was issued by the state, and is a legal form of identification, and offering other forms of legal ID, he refused and rudely asked me, ""What do you want?!"". I responded that I wanted my food and the birthday mai tai that I was legally allowed to have, and he snapped that he would just get me my drink so I would stop. I thanked him, but maybe 5 minutes later, he returned and said that nobody in that establishment would be serving me a drink or would accept my driver's license as they were afraid they would lose their liquor license. You can't lose your liquor license by following the law. You can't lose a food handler card by following the law. When I told the manager that this is what the DMV issues as a temporary ID, he argued with me and treated me like a criminal at my birthday lunch with my parents, in front of dozens of people. I told him that the next time someone comes in with the form of ID that I had, I could only hope he treated them less like a jerk. He loudly, and rudely, claimed that he couldn't and WOULDN'T read my driver's license. I pointed to where my ""Under 21 until..."", ""DOB.."", and ""Name..."" were, and he wouldn't even look at it. He could read it, he could see that I was of age, he just decided that it was his day to treat someone  worse than the rags they use to wipe down their tables. He looked at me as if I was a punk criminal trying to get away with underage drinking. I had been to a wedding the night before, and the staff had no issues reading it when I ordered a glass of wine. I was so humiliated by the manager that I left with tears in my eyes and everyone staring at me as if I was the bad guy.

20,Cassandra C.,"Oregon City, OR",265,186,461.0,1.0,2015-05-31,"We decided to go to Red Robin after about five years of absence. We were feeling the ""cool"" burger experience with a full bar and fun ambiance. Ten years ago Red Robin was known for its fun great food, burgers cooked to order and general casual awesomeness. I do not know what happened to this Red Robin aside of the fact that they have been through the full bloom of a now heavily built up area. With the Clackamas mall, trendy new restaurants and high concentration of shopping traffic this Red Robin died inside. Our time there was pretty bad. It was really bad actually. It was enough for me to email the company in distress which I usually avoid. It broke my heart to pay for our meal. Only two members of my party ate some of their food and they were very unhappy with it. The rest of the food was taken away at the end of the meal with one bite taken and a server who did not ask us why.  We ordered the appetizers of Fried Zucchini and fried fresh Jalapenos. Why? The Zucchini was not mushy or oily, it was still to the bite and fresh tasting. I will give them that. The batter itself was overcooked and greasy. They mixed the two appetizers together creating a glob of fried jalapenos and zucchini. Two or three bites in and we were done. A drink order of Crown Royal Whiskey on the rocks tasted like a hard candy. The glass was unwashed and still had the residue of whatever fruity cocktail had once been in it. This is unforgivable. We asked the server if perhaps they had accidentally served us a flavored whiskey but were informed they did not carry any flavored whiskey. It was simply a unwashed glass.  The burgers that we ordered, we all ordered ""as rare as you can do them"". We know that most restaurants have to cook to a certain temperature for health regulation reasons. Red Robin in the past has always been able to provide some good tasting beef at medium rare while staying within those guidelines. They cremated our burgers. I have to admit that I was shocked almost to tears at my over ten dollar burger which came without most of the listed toppings and was burnt. It was a deep grey color on the inside. I could not eat more than one bite. I had the Prime Chophouse. I dislike McDonald's burgers, but even theirs would taste better. I will never go back to this location. We were ignored by our server.

It was the perfect amount of spicy with chipotle sauce and pepper jack cheese. It was yummy. My child got the fish and chips, and for fish and chips at Red Robin, they were good and crispy.

Most of the time I have had fairly pleasant experiences with them , this one was not so great. Restaurant was cold, it was cold outside and the wind was blowing but even with my jacket on it took some time to warm up inside. I ordered water without ice, it came with ice. My daughter ordered hot chocolate, it came lukewarm. The waitress did offer to bring her a warm one and did  bring me water without ice I think after she heard me discussing with my partner how they had messed this up. They now have electronic touchpads you can order on at the table, you can also play games on these but it cost you money. This is a big distraction when you have a young child who wants to play the games that are priced at a premium. This diminished the experience I had as my daughter was more focused on wanting to play games and not happy that she wasn't allowed to. They also keep advertising pictures of dessert, anyone with a child knows when they're flashing ice cream and root beer floats the ""can I have"" questions come over and over again. I ordered the guacamole burger as I had before on a number of occasions. The toppings on the burger were sparse, usually while eating a burger there it makes a bit of a mess on the plate. I guess looking for the positive here there was no mess the negative, a lot of flavor was missing. It was still an OK burger but not what I expected. My partner woke up at 3 AM with a very upset stomach after eating her normal dinner there. The floor had a bit of a dirty greasy feel to it.

There are just too many good burgers in this town to settle for a mediocre chain. But my husband, for some reason, thinks RR is terrific. We went on Christmas Eve prior to catching a movie at Clackamas Town Center. This was our first, and probably last, experience with their tabletop consoles. No thank you, we don't want to play games (for a price) while we eat dinner. Actually, we choose to engage with each other instead. We did use the ""call your server"" option when we were being ignored. Leah, our server, came over, turned off the device, then told us she'd be back in a few minutes. WTF?  What's the point of calling her if she's still going to ignore us?  All they're doing is reducing staffing and increasing customer frustration with this little doo-hickey. Our burgers were ok, not great, as always. Fries came out cold, and based on Leah's response, my guess is that this happens a lot. It happened the last time I was there too. From what I hear, RR is trying to increase profit on the whole bottomless fries option.

We only had a party of 3 so it was not like we were hard to sit.  Not surprisingly the other tables also got their food before us.   Next is not only based on this visit but rather my sinking opinion of the franchise. There was a time when I would argue that it was a great deal with their bottomless fries (THAT THEY USED TO GIVE OUT STRAIGHTAWAY BUT NOT ANYMORE) and a nicely prepared burger that i think USED to be a great bargain. Also I really liked their BBQ chicken salads that are now just a splattering of iceberg with a cold piece of chicken on the side.  I've watched this over the years shrink from a well-prepared bowl of salad to an appetizer side stretched out on a rectangular plate.   Now back to my experience today.  The burger on our order looked like it might have been sitting a while and my salad did not come with dressing or the sides of Texas toast.  Not the best experience and my son who was meeting us before work had to dash out because of the tardiness of the staff.   The waitress actually felt bad because they forgot the dressing and proceeded to deliver about 4 servings too many  like that was supposed to make up for it.  You know how wait staff gets that feeling of dread when they come back to ask if there's anything else they can get you?   Kind of looks a little like embarrassment?  Well that's they way she was with us the remaining time we were there.  We could not wait to get out of there.   Wanted to try the desserts as well but could not bear another minute there.   The best part of the trip you ask?  The ability to just swipe my card at the kiosk and pay my bill without having to wait for a check to be delivered.  Needless to say I will it be back and as for the Clackamas store I might just use my time to visit the Chick-fil-A next door.  At least there I'm sure of what I'll get and I'm a timely manner.  So long red robin and you can take your rewards card(that still has a free birthday burger on it) back too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.052,2.12

There is another Red Robin inside the mall, so if you use your GPS to get here, make sure you map your route to the correct one you want to go to.  Parking is severely inadequate, especially so now that the lot is shared with Chick Fil A. A few in our party were able to find parking in the lot but some had to park at Petco or Target across the street. We had a reservation and I arrived second to last and they told me how to find the table. It was very crowded and I'm unfamiliar with this location so it took me a few minutes to find the group. It would have been nice to have been led to the table but I understand that they were very busy.  Our group of nine had our own little room  which kept the sound down some. We had separate checks and were accommodated very well. Most of the group had a burger. I had a wrap and one of us had a pasta entree I think.

7,Martin F.,"Oregon City, OR",170,497,178.0,3.0,2017-02-21,"Red keeps innovating with their menu - most hamburger joints put out a fairly standard fare of options and that's it.  Sort of like going to McDonalds and getting either Chocolate or Vanilla Ice Cream or going to Baskin Robins for 31 flavors.  The Chocolate or Vanilla options are going to be less expensive, but seriously, if you can afford it, wouldn't you want to explore many of those other choices? The staff work as a team - your food is brought out as soon as it comes up - either by your server or someone else.  The ingredients are top notch and who can complain about bottomless fries?  (Perhaps a sad choice because anyone who would take advantage of this is certainly far from bottomless). I had the chili-chili burger, served open face.  To me, ""open face"" that should have translated in to ""wow - there's so much chili on the burger that the bun just can not contain it all"".  Sadly the cook at Red translates that to ""put the smallest amount of chili possible on top of the center of the burger and show it off by leaving the top of the bun off to the side"". The wife went for the soup and a wrap.  The combination of french onion soup with a chicken wrap was a great combination for her. We will keep going back - it's more expensive than I would like, but the setting is nice enough, the adult beverage selection is wide enough that it is clearly the ""Baskin Robbins"" of burgers and not McDonald's.  You just gotta expect to have to pay for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas,2.44,2.6,2.6,,2.536
6,Robert G.,"Clackamas County, OR",36,585,5929.0,4.0,2017-03-04,"Fern bars  and  coupons The term ""fern bar"" probably originated when men sported mustaches and women worked hard on their feathered hair.  I still find it funny.  And I still use it.  A ""fern bar"" was basically a low- to mid-priced (chain) eatery featuring burgers, sandwiches, and libations which was decked out in downmarket wood paneling, brass railing, and, you guessed it, greenery such as ferns.  They could also double as pick up places. Having lived in North Clackamas County for quite a while, I knew of the Clackamas Red Robin but never went there.  I had been to a Red Robin once before.  It was probably in the Southeastern U.S. somewhere.  My opinion of the chain was neither negative or positive.   Well, a red coupon arrived and it knocked off $4 off of a meal costing $10 or more.  I decided to go to the nearby Red Robin, south of and across from Clackamas Town Center and sharing the parking lot with Chick-fil-A.  After all, I needed dinner.  That coupon expires tomorrow, March 5th. A person walks in, sees the hosting stand, and has multiple choice when it comes to where they might sit.  From left to right, there is a more dim seating area with booths, a brighter and bigger seating area with a taller ceiling, an area of booths raised up in true ""fern bar"" fashion sort of behind the bar, and then the bar with its stools and eating area fronting the greenhouse type windows.  I ate in the bigger dining room. There is a lot to choose from and they present burgers many different ways.  There are also chicken burgers, entrees, some Mexican staples, appetizers, and a boatload of cocktails. I had a turkey burger.  I had them add sauteed mushrooms.  The platter came with steak fries.  And one can have more of these steak fries upon requesting them.  I thought that was sort of cool.  Truth be told, the turkey burger was very good.  The fries were good, and it was even better that I could enjoy a second batch of them.  There were some interesting lemonades being served but, being winter(y), I stuck to a cup of coffee. The service was very amicable and expedient.  The server kept checking in on me.  The prices are fair and, if one sticks to an entree and a non-alcoholic drink, the tab is reasonable.  It's when people go bonkers on appetizers, desserts, and booze that the tab climbs ... but that's true anywhere.   Well, Red Robin is still a ""fern bar.""  It's also a sports bar.  And I also discovered it appears to be a date night sort of place for younger Clackamettes and Clackameisters.  Good God, especially to the latter.  And I'm going to be nicer than most of the reviewers.  Do I give it a 4 for F-E-R-N?  Or do I give it a 3 for B-A-R?  Even if I averaged the two, the 3.5 would round up to 4 stars.  For its genre, what can you expect?  It's true to form.  I'm o.k. with 4 stars for Red Robin - Clackamas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas,2.52,2.62,2.62,,2.58

Our pediatrician's office is not too far from this location, and lo and behold! It was booster shot time for our youngest daughter, Turtledove. When the Male Unit and I asked what she was in the mood for, the reply was, ""Steamed broccoli!"" And so, we headed for the nearby Red Robin. We've been to other Red Robins before, as Turtledove and our goddaughter, Ladybug, enjoy going there after seeing shows or movies. They tend to be pretty noisy. I'm legally deaf, and it would still be far too loud for me. Thankfully, this was not the case at the Clackamas location.  The hostess saw me coming in with my cane, and was quick to ask me where I'd be most comfortable in a sincere and polite manner. She even offered to let us change tables if it wasn't working out for me, which I appreciated. The food was good, and I particularly enjoyed the strawberry lemonade. It's also nice to order some broccoli for Turtledove and not have the server try to convince you to smother it in cheese! I had the Clucks & Fries, which are particularly nice with the honey mustard dipping sauce. The Male Unit had some sort of mushroom burger, and reported it was a perfect medium.  Easily the best part of the experience was our server, Noelle. As my husband is also in the service industry (and I used to be), and there were few other customers at the time, we had a nice chat with her about the many pros and cons of the business in Portland (particularly how the now-widespread use of electronic ordering/game tablets on the tables are loved by some customers and loathed by others).  But what I appreciated most was how she interacted with our daughter. Following the immunization, she was less like her usual, chipper Turtledove self and more like her rarely-seen alter-ego, Snapping Turtle. But Noelle had her smiling and laughing in no time!  The next time Turtledove & Ladybug want some Red Robin, we'll return to this location. Same food, less headaches!

5,C S.,"Portland, OR",0,8,2.0,1.0,2017-10-14,"Another if I could rate zero stars I would as I do like the food but trying to get it is getting to be not worth it.  I ordered online for curbside pickup a salad and a burger.  I arrive at the restaurant when order said would be ready and park in designated spot and call the number listed to let them know I was there.  It just rang and rang and rang.  Finally somebody answered and asked me to hold while he checked for the order.  I WAS ON HOLD OVER 5 MINS when I went inside to find out what was going on.  There was nobody up front so I had to flag down a server I think to see if I could get my order, started to tell her somebody left me on hold and she was gone.  Five mins later she comes back and says my food is in the bar.  SHE SAID SHE WAS TRYING TO FIND A MANGER BUT WAS NOT WORTH TALKING TO THEM AS SHE PUT IT ""THEY ARE A WRECK"" and handed me my food.  Horrible, horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas,2.48,2.45,2.45,,2.462
0,Ariel H.,"Oregon City, OR",234,5,2.0,5.0,2017-11-28,"Wow! This restaurant sure has evolved to catch up with the modern look and atmosphere. It's clear there are many fast paced changes being incorporated from the corporate stand point but the staff seem to be doing their best to adjust and make their guests happy! I continue to enjoy every meal delivered to my table from this store! I understand wait times for tables and for food on busy nights, but most of the time I have prompt friendly service and delicious food! I am very difficult and often modify my food to where it is no longer a recognizable menu item, and very rarely do my complicated orders get messed up, and when they do they are fixed quite quickly! Today I had the Big Taco Tavern with ancho grilled chicken, added chipotle mayo, had the guacamole on the side, and upgraded to the delicious voodoo fries that I'm absolutely in love with! Tasted amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas,2.64,2.48,2.48,,2.544
1,Megumi A.,"Clackamas, OR",5,6,6.0,1.0,2017-12-08,"I'd give 0 stars if I could. After placing my order online I immediately called the store to verify pick up time and to verify I'd like extra of both kinds of fries ordered. I arrived 5 min prior to my ready time and calIed. I waited for approximately 15 min when a young man came out and said my order wouldn't be ready for another 15-20min. I asked why i wasn't told when I first arrived and why is the wait time so long now. He answered they got a rush after my order was placed.  I had 2 young children with me that were hungry (which is why we choose pick up).  As I was waiting another pick up order pulled in, went inside for 10-15 min and came out with their order. Their order ready time was 15min AFTER mine was quoted online. I finally received my order at 7:50 (50 minutes I waited in my car with starving children and no check up). I was not offered any comp for my wait so I asked to speak to the manager. Our order was cold, didn't get extra fries until I pointed out I didn't get what I specifically asked for and my order was wrong! I paid extra for avocado and didn't get any in my wrap. It was my kids bedtime by the time we got our cold food and I had to demand a refund...which I still have yet to get. I will not be giving Red Robin any more of my money when there are so many other businesses that can efficiently run a dinner service.  Update: never got a refund and when I call to follow up a month later they said they send out gift certificates (which was never mentioned as I would never agree to give this location another minute of my time) Run as far away from this business as you can. Better yet eat at Chick-fil-A. I could've gone through the drive thru and gotten better service/food. They share the same parking lot",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas,2.64,2.48,2.48,,2.544
3,Stephanie C.,"Portland, OR",0,11,,2.0,2017-12-31,"You may get bottomless fries in restaurant, but if you order to go you'll be lucky if you have ten in the box. Pretty much a rip off, that's the last time I come to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas,2.6,2.48,2.48,,2.528
2,Michaela T.,"Portland, OR",183,78,37.0,3.0,2017-12-31,"Gotta say, I was seriously unimpressed. Asked for fries ahead of time per usual, did not receive them. It felt chaotic and stressful with the waitresses changing twice and constant commotion. We did not all receive our drinks at the same time same goes for the food. When we did get our food, the fries were cold and mushy. I order the same thing every time, bbq chicken wrap, chicken was dry and there was hardly any sauce. Not my favorite experience and definitely not my favorite location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clackamas,2.64,2.46,2.46,,2.532
