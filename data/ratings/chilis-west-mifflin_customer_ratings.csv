38,Jeffrey K.,"Clairton, PA",1,60,,5.0,2012-08-01,"A year or two ago, Chili's updated their menu. And in doing so, eliminated the best burger from any chain, and maybe any burger joint, the Ground Peppercorn Burger. But today, the staff informed me that even though it is not on the menu, they still will make items from the old menu, and I was able to order one. It was every bit as good as I remember. The staff here is excellent, food preparation was very good. The only downside is that the interior is a bit dated, and they don't have wi-fi(if you need such a thing).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-mifflin?start=20,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997
30,Darren W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2949,1450,4662.0,3.0,2012-08-04,"Ehhh, Chili's is adequate if not astonishing.  I last came to this West Mifflin Chili's franchise in 2003. Then unemployed, I was being treated to lunch by my sympathetic mother and bought Metallica's St. Anger fresh from the factory with what little cash I had on hand at The Exchange in nearby Century Square... It turned out that I liked St. Anger a bit more than my meal.  Last night, Kay discovered a gift card for Chili's in the abyss of her satchel. To the wilds of West Mifflin we headed to redeem it only to wait 20 minutes for a table amongst suburban families and Harley-Davidson aficionados.  The salsa we were given was more like a cold, spicy soup. The tortilla chips were akin to eggshells, falling apart in the salsa and the dismal mud of the Skillet Queso, a dull quagmire of cheese, beans, and tiny morsels of beef.  Kay wanted no part of the guacamole, so to quell my superfood craving, I ordered the Avocado Burger... Cooked to a medium-rare as per my specifications, the patty, humid, thick, and perfectly fine in every way,  came inside a whole wheat bun with Swiss cheese, avocado slices, and an ""avocado-ranch"" to make it a bit more intriguing than the standard bacon-cheeseburger.  The thick fries were a bit too starchy and mushy on the insides. Am I who I think I am? A discerning fan of spuds dunked in hot oil? Hey, it's my favorite track off the record. I had to find a way to work it into the review somehow.  Onto dessert... Something tells me the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie is Chili's best dessert. Call it a hunch, something I can't quite point at?  A warm cookie dough with nuts, coconut shreds, hot fudge, caramel, and vanilla ice cream is an easy crowd-pleaser considering every other such restaurant has a similar item on their menus. Hot-n-gooey met cold-n-creamy, married, and had a respectable child.  That's Chili's: Respectable and not much more, and like the album St. Anger, I like the place more now than I did 9 summers ago. They are what Mad Mex would become if Bob Rock got a hold of them.  P.S. Chili's used to have an onion blossom appetizer on their menu once, didn't they? If so, would that make it Mustaine or Newsted? Can we expect a new band or side-project? Will it defect to another restaurant like Jason did with Voivod? P.P.S. Shamefully, two of the waitresses came off like Lars and James, tyrannizing another poor server as if she was Kirk. Ours was more on the Robert Trujillo side; she was new and just stayed out of it. Nonetheless, it was uncalled for. Tense, awkward, and painful to witness,  it certainly hindered the enjoyment of our dinner a notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-mifflin?start=20,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

The fish was fresh and hot. The mango and avocado pico de gallo on top of the fish was a flavor explosion in my mouth. My son had a cheeseburger and ate almost all of it.

I feel that this was the worst visit I've ever experienced at any of your Chili's locations in my life. I'm 23 years old and work very hard for the money I get, on top of going to college full time for further my career and live on my own. For me to go out to dinner, it's rare but since I used to work in the restaurant industry, I expect good service and understand what is required from a server. The service I received at the West Mifflin Chili's was horrible. The hostess seemed annoyed that we were coming in TWO hours before closing. I requested a booth, she gave me an attitude and said ""fine."" No smile, no professionalism, and no manners. I then get seated where there's only one other two top seated, didnt get greeted for 7 minutes after being sat. It took us about 45 minutes to get our food that had been clearly sitting under the heat light for atleast 10 minutes in the kitchen. He did not come back once to check on us after getting the food.

The service is always great- I will say that. My boyfriend and I usually sit in the bar area- tonight we sat in a booth. The restaurant itself is always very clean. The food is mediocre. I always try new items and I have yet to find something that I love. My boyfriends favorite menu item is their honey chipotle chicken crispers- I must admit that the sauce is pretty tasty. Their chicken is just off to me.. I had their chicken fajitas tonight and the chicken is so light colored it just appears like it isn't prepared right. Clearly, I know it's a chain restaurant and mostly all of their items are originally frozen...

I ordered the queso dip with a side of ranch. 10 minutes later the chips arrived but no queso or ranch. Instead there was salsa. The sever said the queso would be out shortly. I reminded her of the ranch. She so oops I forgot it, let me go grab it for you. Another 15 minutes goes by and finally the queso comes out. Again I ask for some ranch.... 5 minutes later it finally comes. During this whole time I am with out a drink. I ended up having a different server get me a drink. Now when the entrees come out mine is literally dropped right infront of me hard enough that it CRACKED THE PLATE!!! The plate itself was greasy and you could see it was wiped with a dirty towel.

13,Denny V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",50,153,272.0,1.0,2016-01-26,"Ok... Got talked into coming here from a '2 for $20' email offer I received, the steak looked great.  Got in & seated right away.  Handed menu's & nothing was mentioned of the '2 for $20'.  Had to find it on the 'Waitress replacer', that stupid digital game console they have at your table.  Asked waitress about it, she picked up the 'replacer' and read from there.  Wow, I could have done that!  Nothing mentioned about steak as a choice.  Thought we misread the email but it was too late as I had deleted it.  My wife ordered the Grilled Steak Fajitas, Add Shrimp, Add side or Rice & Beans, NO GREEN PEPPER.  I ordered the AUCE Enchiladas.  I also ordered Chips & Salsa.   The C&S arrive right away, the entrees arrive a half hour later.  A Half Hour?  Admitted- the restaurant was a little busy- but we were seated right at the kitchen door and there weren't orders flying out that door.  My Steak Enchiladas looked great.  My wife's Fajitas had green pepper on them!  I usually give the waitress / kitchen staff the benefit of the doubt on really special requests but asking that ONE ITEM be left off the plate and they screwed up.  We flagged down the waitress and when she was told about the peppers, the waitress simply said, 'Oh, I will have them re-fire another...'  It was clear that the waitress screwed up.  What was confusing was that she WAS WRITING DOWN OUR ORDER as we were giving it.  My wife 'opted out' of the 're-fire'.  She insisted I eat mine but that she wasn't going to have a new one made up because of the stories we've heard about how they treat 're-fires' at franchises.  She was happy to just let me enjoy my entrée.  The manager came by to apologize and to again offer a 're-fire' but we turned it down. When I was about half way through my enchiladas, the waitress came by to ask if I'd like to get another one started.  'Yes' I said, 'Chicken this time please...'.  I finished my first order and waited... and waited... and waited... So long that another waitress stopped by to ask if she could get us anything else, to which I replied 'I'm still waiting for my second order of Enchiladas'.  She went right over to the To-Go Register, did a quick search, typed something in and went back out through the kitchen.  At no time did our original waitress stop by to check on us.  We waited for another maybe 10 minutes and decided to cut our losses.  We paid through the 'Waitress Replacer', grabbed our coats and got up to leave.  As we were headed out our waitress appears and says, 'Oh, are you leaving?  My manager was on her way over...'  Really?  To tell us what?  That they can't get anything right?   It's a real shame too because we have been in a rut recently where we've gone to the same restaurant over & over and we thought we'd try something new(er), meaning going to Chili's.  I used to spend countless nights at other Chili's when I worked on the road, but never have I experienced as much disregard for the customer...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-mifflin,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

My mom recommended we go here for lunch because she loves this place (bizarre to me, but mother knows best). The menu reminded me of what you'd find at a T.G.I. Friday's or Applebee's. Even though it was the day before Thanksgiving, the restaurant was really slow. We had three servers, including a trainee, waiting on us.  Food was average and decently priced. My family are experts on the menu and pick the same thing each time they come, so the ordering was paced to how fast I could make a decision. We weren't rushed by the servers and the timing of the food arriving was almost perfect. I did have to cram the last large bite of the loaded cheese fries appetizer into my mouth to clear enough room on the table though. But eating more cheese fries is something you will never hear me complain about.  If you're looking for a casual American or Tex-Mex restaurant, this might be your place.  The 2 for $20 deal allows two people to get select entrees and share an appetizer. It's in close proximity to the Century III mall and a shopping center, so you can come here for some reasonable priced food after a day of shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-mifflin,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

Thankfully there were booths (small booths.. One person per side) however, the tables were so tiny. Anyways let me get over that lol. For appetizer we went with the trio where you can pick 3. We went with southwestern eggrolls, sliders and fried cheese balls. The southwestern egg rolls were amazing. The other 2 apps were also good.

I saw an employee wiping a  nearby table and I quietly approached her and discreetly asked her to please clean our table.  She, very pleasantly, complied but also felt the need to tell us several times that it mustn't have been cleaned properly the evening before. We were thankful that she wiped the table for us, unfortunately it was still remained pretty nasty :(.  I am not sure what the use to wipe the tables with??? Food wise, baked potato soup was fairly bland and not very good.  The turkey avocado club was a big hit, as were the fries.  The nacho's with beef added we also pretty tasty.  The double burger was dry and not very edible. Unfortunately when our server checked back to see if everything was okay, the club sandwich person quickly responded ""yes, great!"",  poor double burger person was unable to express her disappointment.  She had cut the burger in half and tried to soldier on but couldn't come close to finishing the half.  Thinking she, herself, was being too critical, gave the other half to the not picky, hungry member of our party.  He took one bite and confirmed that it was not her imagination - it really was awful! When our server came back she was informed of the dissatisfaction and did take it off the check but also seemed really perturbed about it and became rather unpleasant. Let me just say, everyone at this table expects to pay for their meal when they dine out, but we certainly expect to receive edible food.  It was a BURGER (not some new innovative culinary experiment, that was simply not to someone's personal taste) that was terrible.  The waitress didn't prepare or cook it, I presume,  so why is she taking criticism personally?

3,Tony R.,"Bonita Springs, FL",105,8,,1.0,2017-06-16,"I put my name in at 648 and was told the wait would be 25 minutes, we got sat at 750, no waiter for almost ten minutes and then was told that food would be at least 30-40 minutes and that they are out of chicken, pasta, and tilapia. I understand things happen but someone could have told us prior to us waiting three times longer than our quoted wait time that there was no food. We decided to leave. When I spoke with the manager, she just laughed it off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-mifflin,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
