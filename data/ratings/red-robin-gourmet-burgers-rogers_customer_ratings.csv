I do enjoy the mushroom swiss burger with the parm cheese spread. Fries were super hot. While ""bottomless"" and even though I asked for some when I ordered (always a great appetizer when you are hungry), the waiter never brought them so they get dinged for that fail.

Waited there for 10 minutes and still no wait staff.  After another 5 minutes we managed to get someone to come and take our order. All of the wait staff was in their break room area 'relaxing' and goofing off. When the order finally came out they had gotten it wrong but after so much time wasted it wasn't worth getting it fixed.

20,Rene Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,79,161.0,2.0,2014-01-25,"When I want a good burger around here, Red Robin is the place I think of first because it is very close, and it is always fresh. Last night we decided to venture over so I can get the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger, while my husband planned on the chili burger that ""never disappoints."" This visit was unfortunately lacking.  I asked for my burger to be cooked medium-well (no pink), but there was plenty of pink in my burger. In addition, there just seemed to be something missing from my burger with every bite I took. I finally opened up my burger to review the contents and there was no pickle relish... the stuff that is supposed to make the Gourmet Cheeseburger special. My husband said his burger was good, but the chili seemed to be more spicy than usual.  I completely forgot about the redesign of this chain last year that I don't like. I really preferred the burger basket with fries instead of that silly presentation they have going on with their metal fry cup that gives a tiny serving of fries.  What was more disappointing was the unprofessionalism of the staff. We were seated in a tiny booth on the wall of the kitchen/prep station partition. I suppose the employees believe that the half-wall dividing them and the patrons provide a sound barrier, but it doesn't. It is rather unappetizing to hear employees talking about serving poor tippers or talking about what they want to do on their day off.  Although RR is a 2-minute drive from my house, I will not come to this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rogers?start=20,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003

WAIT: I came to this location a couple of weeks ago. We were a very large group, so we called ahead. We got there and only had to wait a few minutes, not too bad. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I understand since we were a large group and had separate tickets that can be confusing - since my ticket had a extra charge, but she took it off with no problem.  FOOD: This is the part I keep trying to like more. I'm just never blown away or thrilled with my food. I ordered the Burnin' Love Burger, with lettuce instead of a bun. I've had this before and I wanted to give it another chance. It was just fine, not bad by any means, but not amazing.

34,John A.,"Rogers, AR",0,33,,1.0,2015-03-03,"I don't eat out alot but I do enjoy Red Robin, the majority of the time I get it to go, all I can say is don't ever order your food to go from this location. A month ago I called in and it took almost 15 minutes for someone to answer the phone, they told me they were short handed and the restaurant was packed, I show up and not only is the place almost empty but the staff is just standing around. I pay for my food, get home and see my plain burger cooked medium actually was cooked well done and had all the toppings on it. I filled out the survey, was contacted by their management and given a digital gift card. Tonite I placed the exact same order and asked for a side of ranch and honey mustard for the fries. I show up 20 min after I placed the order (that's how long they said it would be) and proceeded to wait for another 10 minutes. Once again the restaurant was maybe 40% full. The girl working the bar had no idea how to use my card and after 5 minutes I became so frustrated I just paid in cash. I get home only to open my order and see the exact same thing, burger cooked medium, with all the toppings only this time they went above and beyond by forgetting to add the side dressings. This is far and away the worst location I've ever been to and I this location would be better run by trained chimps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rogers?start=20,,,,,

But I have to say the service at this location sucks. The bartender, Dakota, is clearly a 'worker' he runs around making drinks, doing dishes and that's it. He barely serves his customers because he's alone in the bar on a Friday night.  a A manager looking guy came and said, ""are you ok, let me know if you need help"". Clearly not going to give him help. There are several empty tables in the bar area that haven't been bused for a while. My husband asked if we could have a table the you guy at the host stand said they are taken, I'm pretty sure they didn't want to clean them.

He proceeded  to take an order from every person in between  his sips of NOS energy drink looking at the computer screen , with no intentions to turn  and face any guest for their order. As he was busy making drinks he continued  with a bad attitude, right along with every other server in the bar area talking  about how terrible their night was. If you have time to talk about how terrible your night is, you have time to be more proficient at your job. Having to ask to make a dinner order when a place is so busy could be understandable. Dakota saying a few more moments when I ask to order as he is entering  his tips in the computer  sipping more energy drink with a bar full of people waiting  to cash out and/or order is awful. I was appalled by the attitude of staff and terrible service. To all Red Robin staff. You never know who may be in your place of work to tip you %50. Act professional.

8,Justin W.,"Rogers, AR",14,32,68.0,5.0,2016-03-16,"We come here pretty regularly. Kyle the server is fantastic. (He kind of looks like Ryan Reynolds.) He always waits on us so promptly and courteously, checking on us several times but not being too hawk-like. The manager on staff, I'm not sure of his name, but he is always right there and displaying servant leadership by working right alongside his people. We always get at least one, sometimes 2-3, check-ins from this guy. He's super nice. I've encountered several other waiters and waitstaff at this location and I've never found anyone to be less than courteous and helpful. In fact, I'd venture to say the #1 reason we tend to frequent this joint is because the service is always stellar... And we always leave a bit happier than when we came in.  As far as the food goes; it's always hot, fresh, and cooked to order. My favorite is the Big Pig Out; a thick, juicy patty, topped with American cheese, bacon, and slathered in bacon aoili with a sesame seed bun. Mmm. So Delicious. Not to mention the bottomless steak fries with a side of campfire sauce, wooeeeee! As far as their premium burgers go, the A1 Peppercorn burger has always been a favorite of mine because of the hint of heat. The Banzai burger makes an appearance at my table every trip, because of the thick slice of pineapple topping the fresh all-beef patty.  They even have a badass option on their lighter-fare menu! A burger place with an awesome low-cal option? Yeah, I'm not kidding... It's called the Chicken Ensanada Platter and if it were a person it'd be someone I'd enjoy hitting the town with. It comes with two nicely-spiced, grilled chicken breasts drizzled with a light ranch sauce and some super fresh Pico. It also has a small side salad topped with a light bit of tortilla strips for some crunch, another side of Pico, and another side of ranch. The two breast platter rocks in at like 430 calories. For the taste explosion you get with this platter-- it's hard to believe. Super healthy and super delicious, who would've thought they could coexist on one plate at Red Robin of all places.. Oh, but it does, my friend... It does. Try it.  As far as desserts go, the Towering D'oh rings (reminds me of Homer Simpson lol) is the go-to for our table. Even if we're stuffed, we get those bad-boys to go. The short stack comes with 4 freshly-made sugared mini-donuts and a side of thick, hearty chocolate dipping sauce (tastes like legit Hershey's) and a side of rich berry dipping sauce (a bit thinner consistency). I can't tell you which dipping sauce I like more, like people with more than one kid-- you don't pick favorites, you just love them equally.  So let's see-- delicious, hot, made-to-order burgers, delectable desserts, and a wait staff who actually cares about your dining experience? Yes, please-- I'll be a regular. Sign me up. :) This Red Robin location rocks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rogers,,,,,

We were seated at a table with booth seating on one side and chairs on the other. The kitchen is partially open to the dining room with a pick up counter between the two.  The hamburger offerings are quite extensive and you can swap out the burger for chicken, a garden burger or a Vegan Bocaburger. Nice! Burgers come with endless fries but you can substitute. Other sides include sweet potato fries, and fruit. Check out the menu. They have craft and other beers on tap and I understand Kyle the bartender is pretty awesome.

This was around the 5th time we have dined at this location.  The hostess said hello and then walked us over to the bar area. I said politely that we would prefer a booth. She did not say a word and walked us over to a booth. She tossed the menu down on the table and walked off never looking back at us. It was so weird. If the restaurant was busy I would have sat at a barstool table but we were tired from walking and wanted to relax in a booth. It took a while for our waitress to arrive at our booth and right from the start she had an attitude. We are sure the hostess told her we were difficult to deal with. She brought us water and asked us if we were ready to order. I told her we needed a few more minutes and she rolled her eyes. This is the worst experience we have ever had with this location. All of the other visits the service was great. Our food was good but our waitress never came back on her own to check on us. The restaurant was not busy at this time. We had to ask another waitress to bring us more of the bottomless fries. We are Royalty members so we saved $6.99 on our bill which was great. We still left a tip but this waitress didn't deserve one at all. Her name is on our receipt but I will not state it here. As for the hostess she needs to go. While half way into our meal we watched her do the same thing to another group of guests. She took them to the bar area and they requested a booth. She tossed the menu down and walked off. A lady in that group mentioned that they had made her mad. This hostess needs to know that she is the first impression of the restaurant. If she doesn't like her work she needs to look for another job. We will be going back because like I said above, my husband loves Red Robin but if the service is as bad as it was on Saturday we will let the manger know. Just like the employees of this restaurant we work hard for our living and going out to eat is a treat for my husband and I.

But these minor details aren't why I have them 2 stars. There were 2 issues. 1 slow service, even though I  come in and it gets busy. The bartender/waiter just needed to learn to be more efficient as a waiter. 2 where is the local !@#%^^ craft brews? I asked and was told, here the waiter just acted like he did give a rats rear when he looked down at me and said ""Corporate said no more local beer."" No sympathy of any kind and turned away as I ordered unsweet tea. He actually had to turn back around and be told twice. Don't know if they had local beer for longer than a hot minute but I won't be going there again. For just that reason alone. I say give the customers what we want. And support our local economy and small businesses too. Their competition has local craft brew.  Notice how most places put the domestic local beers in a category that lets them up charge for it.
