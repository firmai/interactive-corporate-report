We ordered appetizers, and they never came. As we were waiting 20 minutes for the appetizers, the entrees came out! So our waitress said sorry and tried to take the entrees off our table and go get the appetizers. That makes NO sense because by now the appetizers would have been cold, and they would have left the entrees out as we ate the cold appetizers. We canceled the appetizers.

609,Grace C.,"Yonkers, United States",0,4,,3.0,2012-05-27,"Okay, so maybe five hours ago I would've given this place a 4-star rating (Yay! I'm a fan) but after this evening, I'm sticking to a 3-star rating (A-OK) and I'm not giving this place a 1 because one of the waiters came to our rescue for the second time (thank you, Anthony!!!) and I've had good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory (with minor mishaps) before. The Cheesecake Factory should give Anthony a promotion because he is very attentive (to people like us who have been waiting for twenty-five minutes for our waitress to tend to us). He wasn't even in charge of our table and he was the only one who had the decency to tend to us. Bravo, Anthony!  Anyway, we waited forty minutes to be seated and granted it was Sunday afternoon, we were okay with that and we're use to it when it comes to this particular Cheesecake Factory. Okay, so we were seated and that is when my perception of this place spiraled downward!! (I use to love coming here). My husband and I were so mad because after being ignored for twenty minutes, we decided to speak to a manager. Was she any help? NO!! She assured my husband that she would take care of it but she didn't do anything about it, Anthony did!! She continued to avoid our table and even spoke to the people at the table next to us, who were having service issues with the waitress who was supposed to tend to us. The lady next to us told us, ""You didn't miss out on anything."" The manager didn't even look at us, no apology, NOTHING. I get it, it was busy, but after someone is seated, IT'S GAME TIME!  Moving on to the food. I always order the Americana Cheeseburger, no pickles (because with the pickles the burger turns out too salty), no onions (because when they do put grilled onions, they put waaaaay too many and that completely overpowers the other flavors), no tomatoes because I just prefer it that way and medium-well. Usually (not all the time) the burger turns out great, but tonight, I guess they just didn't have their game face on. It was a little bland. I ordered it with the sweet potato fries and they were too soft all around (they're supposed to be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside). I guess they were sitting out for too long. The sweet potato fries here are hit or miss. Half of the time I have to send them back and get a new batch. Sometimes they are overcooked, sometimes cold.  I think this place has a lot of potential but management, I think, needs to get more involved and some of the staff need to be re-trained (except for Anthony). There is one manager who is very attentive though. He would've solved the problem right away, but this blonde short-haired woman, didn't care enough to make it up to us. Actually, since she told my husband she would take care of it during their conversation, my husband told Anthony to ask her, how was she going to take care of it. All she could do by the end of our meal was give us a free cheesecake and not charge us for my daughter's ice cream who was growing very impatient during our almost two hour wait. (I always tell her to remain calm though). Sorry lady, cheesecake is not going to solve your lack of hospitality sense. I decided to go with the red velvet which is good but too sweet. I love sweets but they have to be well-balanced. I have had the Godiva cheesecake, which I really recommend!! Not in this Cheesecake Factory though. Luckily, we got out right on time for our parking to be free (not a big deal but a good perk!). They validate but you're lucky if you get out on time. Just bring $3.25 just in case. We will not be returning. Sorry Cheesecake @ Ridgehill, we really did want to like you. We tried like six times and each time the service lacked more and more. Hope this helps fellow Yelpers!  *They do brunch on Sundays but I've never tried the food. I've also tried the Four Cheese Pasta and the Avocado Eggrolls and both are really tasty.

I'm a fan) but after this evening, I'm sticking to a 3-star rating (A-OK) and I'm not giving this place a 1 because one of the waiters came to our rescue for the second time (thank you, Anthony!!!) and I've had good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory (with minor mishaps) before. The Cheesecake Factory should give Anthony a promotion because he is very attentive (to people like us who have been waiting for twenty-five minutes for our waitress to tend to us). He wasn't even in charge of our table and he was the only one who had the decency to tend to us. Bravo, Anthony!  Anyway, we waited forty minutes to be seated and granted it was Sunday afternoon, we were okay with that and we're use to it when it comes to this particular Cheesecake Factory. Okay, so we were seated and that is when my perception of this place spiraled downward!! (I use to love coming here). My husband and I were so mad because after being ignored for twenty minutes, we decided to speak to a manager. Was she any help? NO!! She assured my husband that she would take care of it but she didn't do anything about it, Anthony did!! She continued to avoid our table and even spoke to the people at the table next to us, who were having service issues with the waitress who was supposed to tend to us.

514,Kaylan N.,"Cortlandt, United States",0,5,,1.0,2013-02-23,"Tonight was by far the most horrible experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I've had bad experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory before, but I keep on giving it a chance because I enjoy the food and the close proximity to my house.  Last time I went to the Yonkers Ridge Hill location, I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and they forgot to take out the layers of parchment paper before serving me the sandwich. I took a bite of my sandwich to find myself taking a bite of wax paper. The manager was very sorry and refired my order.  By the time I got a new sandwich, my whole table was done eating their meal. However, he did take the sandwich off the bill. Needless to say after twenty minutes of waiting, I asked for a box to take my food to go.  Tonight, we went to at 7:30. We walked up to the hostess and she said the wait would be 30-40 minutes. On a Saturday night at that time, we expected to wait for a little while. We waited for 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 hour and finally an hour and twenty minutes went by. I finally went up to check with the hostess after I saw several people that arrived after us be seated. The hostess looked in the computer and couldn't find our reservation at all. She said there was no record of our name or timer number. AFTER 1 hour and 20 minutes of waiting we weren't on the list! She quickly apologized and said we would be the next table seated. Then she proceeded to seat another table of two. As soon as we noticed this we brought it to her attention, she apologized again, and finally after 1 hour and 30 minutes, we were seated. We waited three times the promised wait time.  We get to our table and wait 5,10, 15 minutes. No one comes to greet us, take our drink order, nothing. I went up to the hostess station and brought this to her attention. I walked back to our table and someone came to the table to take our drink order, we said we were ready to place our whole order because we waited so long and were beyond starving, but we were quickly told ""I'm not your waiter, but I'll take your drink order.""  Finally, after almost 20 minutes of sitting at a table, the saving grace of our meal, Allan R. took our drink order. He was extremely apologetic and accommodating. Allan quickly took our order and got us our meal. Our food was very good. The manager took the appetizer off of our bill for our troubles. However, the fact that we had to wait 2 hours for a meal was completely unacceptable. The manager knew that they messed up with our reservation and said nothing. The manager knew that no one showed up at our table to take our order and only after the two hours of waiting did he approach us. He was very kind once he approached us and apologetic, but at that point, it was too late.  My fiancee and I frequent the Cheesecake Factory because of it's expansive menu and good food. However, these huge mistakes in customer service are far to frequent for my liking. We will not be returning to the Cheesecake Factory in Ridge Hill.

550,Kenisha L.,"Bronx, United States",7,6,2.0,4.0,2013-05-06,"I have frequented the Cheesecake Factory establishment many times and have grown the innate ability to identify the differences in quality of the food and customer service. I can honestly say that the customer service at this fairly new Cheesecake Factory restaurant impeccable. The manager (Ben) is very accommodating and understanding of the true meaning of high-quality customer service.  I ordered a dinner to-go that unfortunately did not make it home with me, I was a little irritated as I was assured by my waitress that everything was there and I was charged accordingly. Upon realizing that my husband's dinner never made it home I contacted the restaurant at once.

Looked like a real circle jerk, who cleans the table? No one, wait, crickets, we left. WTH? Went to the ""yard house"". Rock on ""Yard House"". Professional service, well done!!!!

445,Jerry M.,"New York, United States",17,157,25.0,3.0,2013-05-11,"Yes, The Cheesecake Factory is tacky. Yes, the dishes can be repulsive, the menu is overwhelming, service is mediocre, and portion sizes are disturbingly large. It's a chain restaurant that represents much of what is wrong with this country - obese individuals perusing the menu with the 2000+ calorie salads and not batting an eye, then, they bring it home to enjoy as a late night snack. Now that I've said that, I also must say - I love it here. I hate myself for eating here, I really do, but if someone suggests it, I'm game. The buffalo blasters are the most gluttonous, mouth-watering, artery clogging appetizer I have ever enjoyed. In my perfect world, we could all eat buffalo blasters for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever having to worry about our skyrocketing cholesterol levels and collapsing life expectancy. Yes, they are that good - the pinnacle of appetizers. I've tried a number of entrees here, they all have the same theme - am I supposed to eat this by myself? Yes, you are. Buckle up and enjoy the ride. Each dish feels as if it was created for everyone to enjoy regardless of your particular taste nuances - from newborn baby to Michelin 3 Star Chef. The Cheesecake Factory isn't for everyone, but I can guarantee that anyone will be able to find something on the menu and enjoy - how can I hate on that?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=180,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.636,2.56

The time before, our food took rediculously long; our waitress was upset we bothered her to let her know that our order was incorrect; and they brought us raw asparagus... Literally...

Yes, the dishes can be repulsive, the menu is overwhelming, service is mediocre, and portion sizes are disturbingly large. It's a chain restaurant that represents much of what is wrong with this country - obese individuals perusing the menu with the 2000+ calorie salads and not batting an eye, then, they bring it home to enjoy as a late night snack. Now that I've said that, I also must say - I love it here. I hate myself for eating here, I really do, but if someone suggests it, I'm game. The buffalo blasters are the most gluttonous, mouth-watering, artery clogging appetizer I have ever enjoyed. In my perfect world, we could all eat buffalo blasters for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever having to worry about our skyrocketing cholesterol levels and collapsing life expectancy. Yes, they are that good - the pinnacle of appetizers. I've tried a number of entrees here, they all have the same theme - am I supposed to eat this by myself? Yes, you are. Buckle up and enjoy the ride. Each dish feels as if it was created for everyone to enjoy regardless of your particular taste nuances - from newborn baby to Michelin 3 Star Chef. The Cheesecake Factory isn't for everyone, but I can guarantee that anyone will be able to find something on the menu and enjoy - how can I hate on that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=180,2.68,2.69,2.69,1.9320000000000002,2.686

When this was newly open, my husband and I were very excited since we didn't have to go farther to white plains or palisades, but the first time we had ordered cheesecake here, the cake was mushy. The texture felt like the cake has been out from freezer for too long. The female manager at the time apologized and replaced it, but it was still mushy  2. I love cheesecake factory so we gave it another try. The following time i ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were burnt. I am not someone to complain about how food taste but sweet potato fries is one of my favorite side dish. I told our server who informed a heavy set male manager. Mgr explained to us that their fries come out like that all the time. He said that they were using some new cooking oil. I insisted that i have been a customer of cheesecake factory in several branches and also had sweet potato fries in other restaurants and never was I ever served burnt fries. Instead of serving me a new cup of fries, he took the one I had, came back in less than 2 mins and told me that he got me new set of fries. I didn't eat the fries anymore because they were the same burnts fries. I was a bit insulted, did he really think I was going to believe it?!?  3. Final straw! My sister in law wanted to celebrate her bday dinner at cheesecake. We waited for 1.5h for our seats. When we finally got seated and having coffee, a cockroach crawled on the table near my coffee. I caught the crawler with the napkin and showed it to the current manager (oct 12, 2014) he took the napkin with crawler and moved us to another table as his solution. This place is at its worst. Never will I come back or invite nor encourage anyone to eat here at this branch. The managers need serious training! The servers are accommodating, but if the management tolerate this type of food and environment in front of customers, u can only imagine what goes behind close doors.

At first glance the waitress, EBONY was very nice, but we noticed she seemed rushed. She did not write our order down but we thought nothing of it at first. 1. Appetizers came out at the same time as our meal.  2. We asked for separate plates and never received them 3. Asked for ketchup 5 times and only received it once we saw a bus boy passing thru, so we asked him. 4. We order 4 meals and only 3 came out because she never ordered it. 5. We order a small hamburger and it was burnt, completely burnt. we tried eating around the burnt areas but it was horrible.  We told EBONY about it and asked her if we could speak to the manager so they could replace it or take it out the bill. We waited 20 minutes and The manager never came to our table and she stated that the manager said that because we had taken some bites of the burnt hamburger that they couldn't do anything about taking off the bill.  And we were fine with that so we asked could they replace it because we were hungry. We also asked about the meal that had never came out and she excused herself as if it had been order but it wasn't. So We waited for our meals and once it came out (15 minutes later ) we decided to just take it home. BUT Once we got home we noticed the hamburger they had replaced, was completely raw and uncooked. Even though the service was horrible, we still tipped her 15% . Our bill was $100. Hopefully one day the service will change and managers and waitress will realize that their lively hood depends on the customers.

296,Ann F.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,,1.0,2014-11-03,"WORST BRANCH! DEPT OF HEALTH SHOULD VISIT!!! Let me list down my reasons: MUSHY CHEESECAKE, BURNT FRIES, AND CREEPERS ON YOUR TABLE. 1. When this was newly open, my husband and I were very excited since we didn't have to go farther to white plains or palisades, but the first time we had ordered cheesecake here, the cake was mushy. The texture felt like the cake has been out from freezer for too long. The female manager at the time apologized and replaced it, but it was still mushy  2. I love cheesecake factory so we gave it another try. The following time i ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were burnt. I am not someone to complain about how food taste but sweet potato fries is one of my favorite side dish. I told our server who informed a heavy set male manager. Mgr explained to us that their fries come out like that all the time. He said that they were using some new cooking oil. I insisted that i have been a customer of cheesecake factory in several branches and also had sweet potato fries in other restaurants and never was I ever served burnt fries. Instead of serving me a new cup of fries, he took the one I had, came back in less than 2 mins and told me that he got me new set of fries. I didn't eat the fries anymore because they were the same burnts fries. I was a bit insulted, did he really think I was going to believe it?!?  3. Final straw! My sister in law wanted to celebrate her bday dinner at cheesecake. We waited for 1.5h for our seats. When we finally got seated and having coffee, a cockroach crawled on the table near my coffee. I caught the crawler with the napkin and showed it to the current manager (oct 12, 2014) he took the napkin with crawler and moved us to another table as his solution. This place is at its worst. Never will I come back or invite nor encourage anyone to eat here at this branch. The managers need serious training! The servers are accommodating, but if the management tolerate this type of food and environment in front of customers, u can only imagine what goes behind close doors.

At first glance the waitress, EBONY was very nice, but we noticed she seemed rushed. She did not write our order down but we thought nothing of it at first. 1. Appetizers came out at the same time as our meal.  2. We asked for separate plates and never received them 3. Asked for ketchup 5 times and only received it once we saw a bus boy passing thru, so we asked him. 4. We order 4 meals and only 3 came out because she never ordered it. 5. We order a small hamburger and it was burnt, completely burnt. we tried eating around the burnt areas but it was horrible.  We told EBONY about it and asked her if we could speak to the manager so they could replace it or take it out the bill. We waited 20 minutes and The manager never came to our table and she stated that the manager said that because we had taken some bites of the burnt hamburger that they couldn't do anything about taking off the bill.  And we were fine with that so we asked could they replace it because we were hungry. We also asked about the meal that had never came out and she excused herself as if it had been order but it wasn't. So We waited for our meals and once it came out (15 minutes later ) we decided to just take it home. BUT Once we got home we noticed the hamburger they had replaced, was completely raw and uncooked. Even though the service was horrible, we still tipped her 15% . Our bill was $100. Hopefully one day the service will change and managers and waitress will realize that their lively hood depends on the customers. If you having a bad day or are ready to go home and are rushing, you should think about the quality of service you are giving to the customers who ultimately are the ones who pay your salary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=280,2.6,2.43,2.43,2.372,2.498

Only once did i need to wait about 30 minutes or so but we went to Sephora across the street and time went by fast.  The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I haven't had to constantly look for my server because they always come to check up on us.  I love love LOVE the Piña Colada from here. Don't like Piña coladas with alcohol so i always order the Virgin Piña coladas and they're amazing. Recommend to everyone! The food is also good but i wouldn't say its amazing. I'd Recommend the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and also the Pasta Da Vinci. Sometimes i find the food too greasy and then i look at the calories of each plate and see why its so high. I just wish it was a bit less greasy. I like how they give free refills with the soda though.  The place is really nice, dim and have outdoor seating good for the warm days ahead.  Lets not forget the reason why they're very famous....the CHEESECAKE. Love the cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake is delicious but my favorite is the classic cheesecake.

When I got there the wait was supposed to be an hour, which was fine since they have tons of drinks at the bar, but even the bar was packed. That was a problem, but suddenly some dude just asked if I needed a table. ""Yeah..."" 2 minutes later I was sitting down checking out the drink menu. That guy wasn't the server but I still ended up tipping him. CF has a bunch of specialty drinks to satisfy any alchie, and I noticed that they have some special low calorie menu, which I quickly dismissed.  The server was very much on point and she suggested some really good avocado egg rolls. Somehow as soon as the appetizers were finished the entrees came out--very memorable service. The Cajun jambalaya was...well, I'd like to have some right now, and the steak Diane with chicken Madeira(?) was absolutely drool worthy. Yeah, that was really good. The server I had was very important though, because she had to leave towards the end and the person who replaced her wasn't the same.

I ordered buffalo wings and chicken sliders with fries . Simple, not too much and thinking I wasn't gonna be as full so I can have a cheesecake... Boy I was wrong . I had six pieces of wings and 1 small chicken slider, and I was beyond full . It was flavorful and the buffalo wings were tasty and spicy . For a place that specializes in cheesecake their wings are to die for . I did order a cheesecake and it was the dulce de leche with caramel cheesecake and it was an amazing choice. Really sweet and you can taste all the sweets given in. Overall the environment, location , taste and portions will leave you coming for more . The price overall was a bit high considering the little I ordered ( just over 60 for the apps and cheesecake, plus a drink) but it was definitely worth it because I was nothing short of satisfied .

Although I came here during a nasty snow storm, the place is beautiful and will definitely be a sight for sore eyes in warm weather.  The Cheesecake Factory itself is magnificent , very late very classy and it even has a full bar. It provides a certain atmosphere of peace and tranquility that makes U feel relaxed and welcome.  I didn't get to dive into the food a lot in terms of options but what I did have was incredible . Coming here hungry but wasn't crazing a meal I stuck to appetizers. I ordered buffalo wings and chicken sliders with fries . Simple, not too much and thinking I wasn't gonna be as full so I can have a cheesecake... Boy I was wrong . I had six pieces of wings and 1 small chicken slider, and I was beyond full . It was flavorful and the buffalo wings were tasty and spicy . For a place that specializes in cheesecake their wings are to die for . I did order a cheesecake and it was the dulce de leche with caramel cheesecake and it was an amazing choice. Really sweet and you can taste all the sweets given in. Overall the environment, location , taste and portions will leave you coming for more . The price overall was a bit high considering the little I ordered ( just over 60 for the apps and cheesecake, plus a drink) but it was definitely worth it because I was nothing short of satisfied .  Ps. Waitress agatha was amazing to us she's an absolute delight !!

178,Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2015-04-28,"I have been a regular at this Cheesecake Factory for the past three years. I have had all of my birthday dinners there. I don't really mind the mediocre service or wait times because I love the food there and, at this point, it's a tradition. I went there on Sunday for my 22nd birthday party. We were seated outside and it was very cold, I ended on wrapping myself up in a hammock to stay warm, but I didn't mind... that's how much I love the Cheesecake factory. My actual birthday, the next day, Monday, a series of terrible things happened making this one of the worst birthdays I've had. My girlfriend's computer crashed (we are seniors at Sarah Lawrence College during our finals week) and I ended up spending a lot of the day with her at the apple store trying to find a solution. To cheer up, before we went home, she suggested a cocktail at the Cheesecake factory. We went to the bar and my waiter from the night before recognized me. ""Hey birthday girl!"" he said, before leaving the bar. I explained that today was my actual birthday so I was just coming in for a drink. The bartender took mine and my girlfriend's IDs, after looking at them for approximately 3 seconds, decided ""neither of these are real,"" throwing them down on the counter and walked away. I called him back over and asked him to scan it or enter it in the computer because it was, in fact, my actual license. He pulled out an ID guide book and told me that my ID should be horizontal if I was 21 (it's a South Carolina ID because I'm a student at Sarah Lawrence, from South Carolina originally). I explained that I had gotten it shortly before I turned 21 since I had lost my old one and needed it replaced. It's vertical, but clearly says ""UNDER 21 UNTIL"" my birthday last year. He asked if I had any other forms of identification that matched this name and I pulled out both of my debit cards and student ID, all clearly stating my name and the ID also had my photo and year at school. He walked away, and for a second I thought he was going to serve us, but it turns out he was just ignoring us and talking to one of the waiters.  At this point, I started to cry. It had already been a horrible birthday, now I couldn't even get a drink at my favorite restaurant. Not only was I not being served, the bartender was rude and condescending. Two men were also behind the bar and we asked if one of them was the manager. The manager came over, looked at our IDs, and still didn't believe mine was real. Let me just say, at this point, that I have never had any issue with this ID. It is my real South Carolina ID that clearly stated it was my 22nd birthday. The manager questioned that as well, holding back a laugh as he said he just ""wasn't so sure about this one."" I asked him to scan it. He didn't. The bartender then comes over, and says ""So you're from South Carolina, and you know Eli?"" I didn't know who Eli was, but he kept nodding to the back of the restaurant so I guess he was referring to the waiter who had recognized me when I walked in. My girlfriend tried to explain that I was here last night for my 22nd birthday, but at this point the bartender wasn't listening and was talking over us. We left, because at that point I was openly crying and didn't want to sit at a bar with these two jerks.  Maybe they didn't have a scanner. That's unfortunate. I just don't understand why they would think I would go to all of that effort if my ID was fake. Thank you for ruining my 22nd birthday, Cheesecake Factory. I have returned here even after shoddy service and many mistakes because I work in the service industry and know that a lot can go wrong in a restaurant. But both of these men were extremely rude and condescending to me just because I look young, refusing to serve me when I was using my valid license.

He pulled out an ID guide book and told me that my ID should be horizontal if I was 21 (it's a South Carolina ID because I'm a student at Sarah Lawrence, from South Carolina originally). I explained that I had gotten it shortly before I turned 21 since I had lost my old one and needed it replaced. It's vertical, but clearly says ""UNDER 21 UNTIL"" my birthday last year. He asked if I had any other forms of identification that matched this name and I pulled out both of my debit cards and student ID, all clearly stating my name and the ID also had my photo and year at school. He walked away, and for a second I thought he was going to serve us, but it turns out he was just ignoring us and talking to one of the waiters.  At this point, I started to cry. It had already been a horrible birthday, now I couldn't even get a drink at my favorite restaurant. Not only was I not being served, the bartender was rude and condescending. Two men were also behind the bar and we asked if one of them was the manager. The manager came over, looked at our IDs, and still didn't believe mine was real. Let me just say, at this point, that I have never had any issue with this ID. It is my real South Carolina ID that clearly stated it was my 22nd birthday. The manager questioned that as well, holding back a laugh as he said he just ""wasn't so sure about this one."" I asked him to scan it. He didn't. The bartender then comes over, and says ""So you're from South Carolina, and you know Eli?"" I didn't know who Eli was, but he kept nodding to the back of the restaurant so I guess he was referring to the waiter who had recognized me when I walked in. My girlfriend tried to explain that I was here last night for my 22nd birthday, but at this point the bartender wasn't listening and was talking over us. We left, because at that point I was openly crying and didn't want to sit at a bar with these two jerks.  Maybe they didn't have a scanner. That's unfortunate. I just don't understand why they would think I would go to all of that effort if my ID was fake. Thank you for ruining my 22nd birthday, Cheesecake Factory. I have returned here even after shoddy service and many mistakes because I work in the service industry and know that a lot can go wrong in a restaurant. But both of these men were extremely rude and condescending to me just because I look young, refusing to serve me when I was using my valid license. I won't ever be returning to this Cheesecake Factory again. Their service has always been so-so, and this is the final straw.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=160,2.6,2.58,2.624,2.6280000000000006,2.588
139,Elsa L.,"Yonkers, NY",135,28,24.0,4.0,2015-05-01,"I have come to this particular cheesecake factory only about 3 or 4 times. I haven't had to particularly wait too long but maybe its because i always go during the week. Only once did i need to wait about 30 minutes or so but we went to Sephora across the street and time went by fast.  The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I haven't had to constantly look for my server because they always come to check up on us.  I love love LOVE the Piña Colada from here. Don't like Piña coladas with alcohol so i always order the Virgin Piña coladas and they're amazing. Recommend to everyone! The food is also good but i wouldn't say its amazing. I'd Recommend the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and also the Pasta Da Vinci. Sometimes i find the food too greasy and then i look at the calories of each plate and see why its so high. I just wish it was a bit less greasy. I like how they give free refills with the soda though.  The place is really nice, dim and have outdoor seating good for the warm days ahead.  Lets not forget the reason why they're very famous....the CHEESECAKE. Love the cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake is delicious but my favorite is the classic cheesecake.  I Haven't been disappointed at this place, and i would recommend. Not sure if they take reservations but it would be a good idea when going on the weekend because the wait is no joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=120,2.72,2.61,2.624,2.9280000000000004,2.654

Sat down and waited for waiter. He showed up 10 minutes later. We ordered drinks   Then we ordered entrees. I asked him what he suggested on menu.  He was bewildered.  Not familiar with menu.  He then blurted out some pasta dish. We waited 40 minutes.  And we did not receive any service.  We were totally ignored.  He passed by our table and looked surprised that we were still there.  He brought us our drinks. We asked him for water.  And he ignored us.  We were DISGUSTED with the service. We walked out. We noticed other tables with their food. Guess cheese cake factory treats people differently.

When I got there the wait was supposed to be an hour, which was fine since they have tons of drinks at the bar, but even the bar was packed. That was a problem, but suddenly some dude just asked if I needed a table. ""Yeah..."" 2 minutes later I was sitting down checking out the drink menu. That guy wasn't the server but I still ended up tipping him. CF has a bunch of specialty drinks to satisfy any alchie, and I noticed that they have some special low calorie menu, which I quickly dismissed.  The server was very much on point and she suggested some really good avocado egg rolls. Somehow as soon as the appetizers were finished the entrees came out--very memorable service. The Cajun jambalaya was...well, I'd like to have some right now, and the steak Diane with chicken Madeira(?) was absolutely drool worthy. Yeah, that was really good. The server I had was very important though, because she had to leave towards the end and the person who replaced her wasn't the same. Mind you, the replacement only had to bring a bill but there was a noticeable quality difference. The other great thing is that the location is excellent.

I'm a cheesecake factory veteran, I've been going for years (this one is still on the new side but I've been to many others) and I know what I like and how I like it.  I very rarely need to look at a menu.  The wait was said to be 30mins but it too a bit longer than that to be seated, that's the main reason I took a star off in this review.  Our waitress was Agatha and when I come here again, I'm definitely going to request sitting in her section.  She was very attentive and made recommendations (even though I really didn't need any).  My other complaint was that my side dish came out luke warm at best, but once I told Agatha about it, she got me a new dish very quickly so I'm not holding that against them. Overall my experience was very pleasant, I enjoyed the things that I ordered.  I was never without a refill on my lemonade (not getting refills in a timely fashion is one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants) and my food was very good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=140,3.16,2.93,2.688,2.32,3.0220000000000002

The sangria did NOT get me even buzzed :-/ ($11!!!!) Upon asking for more bread, he brought it by the time we were done eating. He even gave us a long to-go loaf. Great but still he sucked. Finally, he forgot to bring my yummy birthday cheesecake and singing my Happy Birthday Song. My boyfriend was extremely upset about this. We left him with a $5 tip...he didn't even deserve it.

Was shown a table but asked for a booth the host looked puzzle and made up every excuse not to give us one.  I persisted as the restaurant was half empty. Then was finally directed to a booth. Sat down and waited for waiter. He showed up 10 minutes later. We ordered drinks   Then we ordered entrees. I asked him what he suggested on menu.  He was bewildered.  Not familiar with menu.  He then blurted out some pasta dish. We waited 40 minutes.  And we did not receive any service.  We were totally ignored.  He passed by our table and looked surprised that we were still there.  He brought us our drinks. We asked him for water.  And he ignored us.  We were DISGUSTED with the service. We walked out. We noticed other tables with their food. Guess cheese cake factory treats people differently.

The cheesecake was great, especially their new salted caramel. On our way out my wife and I used the rest rooms. Both were out of toilet paper, filthy and the mens room had a special surprise.

It took Godly strength to leave her the 10% tip I did leave. I think this bar would benefit from a friendly bartender.

109,June G.,"Manhattan, NY",36,36,10.0,2.0,2015-09-12,"While I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory brand, including Grand Lux Cafe, the location at Ridge Hill is abysmal. Initially, I thought their issues could be worked out over time, because every new establishment has to work out its kinks, but this location has now been operational for years. The Good - (1) the Ridge Hill location is super convenient and Cheesecake Factory is one of two businesses in the plaza that validate parking. (2) when the kitchen is on, they serve the usual Cheesecake Factory food well. (3) the bar seating is first come, first serve so often you can avoid the wait The Bad - (1) the kitchen is terribly inconsistent. Cheesecake Factory rests its entire reputation on its machine-like functionality and consistent quality across various locations. THIS location, however, is the only one that I've visited (of many nationwide) in which I never know what I'm going to get on my plate. They've messed up everything from basic Steamed Edamame to signature dishes like Chicken Madeira. (2) Management is constantly turning over so whenever I've had issues, the excuse is ""we have a new [insert restaurant unit] manager"" (3) they seem to be understaffed or don't manage the staffing schedule well - everything is a wait, even when they open.  Ultimately, this place will do business because of The Cheesecake Factory reputation BUT do not go expecting the typical CF experience or you'll be sorely disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=100,2.32,2.83,2.612,2.3760000000000003,2.6260000000000003

I asked the waiter is this chicken she said yea but I still wasn't buying it. So I told her call me the manager he came and I showed him the pink peices and he said I'll have to ask my kitchen manager. He finally comes back and states that they accidentally switched the order. Mind you we don't eat pork!!! And he claimed that they will make the right one now I said no thank you. Instead of having dessert on the house they made us pay for it after saying they will take care of us. The only thing they took off was the app that they got wrong. Cheesecake was served to us still frozen. Literally this is the worst place ever. They tell you 30 mins to wait it's way longer of a wait then that.

The bartender (short Caucasian female long blonde hair) had no personality. I reached for my own menu, asked her to take my order and then threw my card down when I was ready to leave. She never offered me water or any kind of service or small talk. I so badly wanted to tell her if she was as miserable as she seems, she should find a new job. It took Godly strength to leave her the 10% tip I did leave. I think this bar would benefit from a friendly bartender. I would have been easily swayed to get a second glass of wine or a slice of cheesecake. The friendliest she was was when I was leaving, made me feel like she was happy I was leaving.

538,June G.,"Manhattan, United States",36,36,10.0,2.0,2015-12-09,"While I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory brand, including Grand Lux Cafe, the location at Ridge Hill is abysmal. Initially, I thought their issues could be worked out over time, because every new establishment has to work out its kinks, but this location has now been operational for years. The Good - (1) the Ridge Hill location is super convenient and Cheesecake Factory is one of two businesses in the plaza that validate parking. (2) when the kitchen is on, they serve the usual Cheesecake Factory food well. (3) the bar seating is first come, first serve so often you can avoid the wait The Bad - (1) the kitchen is terribly inconsistent. Cheesecake Factory rests its entire reputation on its machine-like functionality and consistent quality across various locations. THIS location, however, is the only one that I've visited (of many nationwide) in which I never know what I'm going to get on my plate. They've messed up everything from basic Steamed Edamame to signature dishes like Chicken Madeira. (2) Management is constantly turning over so whenever I've had issues, the excuse is ""we have a new [insert restaurant unit] manager"" (3) they seem to be understaffed or don't manage the staffing schedule well - everything is a wait, even when they open.  Ultimately, this place will do business because of The Cheesecake Factory reputation BUT do not go expecting the typical CF experience or you'll be sorely disappointed",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=100,2.64,2.74,2.6,1.864,2.7

If you decide to eat here, the nachos with chicken are a MUST. It is their signature appetizer and is absolutely decadent. Literally mouth-watering thinking about it. Also, the shrimp scampi dish is amazing. The shrimp is top quality and the sauce is delicious. It comes with angel hair pasta, which is also great! Overall, definitely one of their top entrees. Everyone also enjoys their burgers because they have a great variety. However, if you love seafood and pasta - their shrimp scampi dish is excellent. Of course, the cheesecake is the best too. The banana creme one is my personal favorite.  The decor is very romantic and beautifully arranged. There is usually a wait to be seated at the Cheesecake factory. Especially after 7pm. However, it is definitely worth trying. They serve you bread with your dinner and offer great drinks to choose from. There is a bar area for those looking to come for drinks and a quick bite. They also offer a ""skinnylicious""menu for people that are on a diet.  It is a very broad menu. Some dishes are better than others. If you try what I suggested, I am sure you will be happy because it was very good. Stay away from the spinach and artichoke dip and the pot stickers.

It took way too long to get anyone to stop at our table for water or to take a drink order. Once we finally ordered, the appetizers came and were just OK. Our entrees came, and the hamburger ordered medium came out looking like beyond well done. That took a long time to find our new server (they changed servers for some reason) she took it back and said they would make a new one. By the time the new one came, everyone had finished their dinners. It was also improperly cooked - rare on the inside and burned on the outside.

My guilty-pleasure food is the mac&cheese burger, although I try not to have it too often, for obvious, artery-clogging reasons. Ive never personally had an issue with the service at this location. Everyone has been mostly pleasant. That being said, I usually avoid the high traffic (weekend) times so maybe I haven't encountered their staff when they're at their most stressed out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20,2.92,2.5,2.628,2.444,2.668

160,cedes w.,"JAMAICA, NY",2,66,3.0,1.0,2016-06-12,"My husband, mother, children and I visited the cheesecake factory at Ridgehill this past week. We visited due to my husband's birthday and my daughter's graduation (This was my husband's first time at any cheesecake factory). From the beginning, I was disappointed with the service and quality of the food. As it being a weekday (Tuesday), it wasn't very busy and we were seated almost immediately outside (upon our request). EVERY SINGLE THING we wanted, I had to call the waiter over to get. I had to find him to get our appetizers in, call him over to get our drinks ordered, request water, ask for him to come so we could get our entree order in. He simply neglected our table. When it got a little chilly, we asked for the heater to be turned on. When the heater turned off, we asked the waiter to turn it back on. He said okay but walked back inside. We had to request the manager when he walked by to help us and turn it on. To add insult to injury half of the time, the waiter was just standing around at the other end of the patio. One other thing that bothered me was that I asked for a glass of water and I told him it was my husband's birthday and I would like for him to get sung happy birthday at the table. He said okay. The food came (much smaller portions than the Nyack and White Plains location) and we finished. He came and just gave us the bill. There was no asking of if we wanted dessert, no asking if we wanted anything else and certainly no happy birthday for my husband. I became infuriated because once I gave him my card he literally stood next to our table eyeing the tip. So lets recap, I had to ask for everything for our meal, you never returned regarding our heater, and didn't sing happy birthday as I requested. We will never be returning to the cheesecake factory at this location ever again. People come to the cheesecake factory for a delicious special meal to share with friends and family. If I wanted to ask for everything or get it myself I could have cooked at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=160,2.96,2.6,2.624,2.116,2.744

137,Kathy L.,"Bronxville, NY",0,9,,4.0,2016-07-10,"We have been to this location a few times. It is kid-friendly and there's a big variety food although the menu can be overwhelming. Overall, it is a good experience if you get there early before it starts to get crowded. My biggest complaint is the take-out counter which has compelled me to write a review.  Here is my breakdown.  Service - We have never had any issues with the wait staff. They are always pleasant and extremely attentive. Our waiter yesterday knew we liked the bread and made sure we had plenty. He came back at the right times after our appetizers, entrees and desserts came to see how we were doing. One complaint about the service is that my child's entrée came before the beverage came.  Food - Food is a hit or miss. There are plenty of eye-catching items on the menu but to read the whole menu takes awhile. I've had the burger before and those are always a hit. I had the fish taco last time and the tacos itself was good but the rice was bland and the beans had a taste to it as if it was many days old.  Dessert - No complaints but should always ask if one wants whipped cream or not. I am not a fan of whipped cream but my child is.  Take-out counter - We didn't want to carry the cheesecake around while we shopped so we came back later on. Not sure where the lack of communication is but there are two people behind the counters and waiters waiting for their dessert and coffee to bring to diners. I don't know why it took over 10 mins for two lattes and two pieces of cheesecake to go. One of them disappeared to get a jar of dressing that was clearly at the counter and the other was pre-occupied. There really isn't a reason to have people wait long enough that one of the maitre'd had to make our lattes herself.

654,Jenna S.,"Yonkers, United States",428,146,,4.0,2016-08-02,"Completely ignore my previous review of the Cheesecake factory. Since then I have come two more times and my experience was delicious. If you decide to eat here, the nachos with chicken are a MUST. It is their signature appetizer and is absolutely decadent. Literally mouth-watering thinking about it. Also, the shrimp scampi dish is amazing. The shrimp is top quality and the sauce is delicious. It comes with angel hair pasta, which is also great! Overall, definitely one of their top entrees. Everyone also enjoys their burgers because they have a great variety. However, if you love seafood and pasta - their shrimp scampi dish is excellent. Of course, the cheesecake is the best too. The banana creme one is my personal favorite.  The decor is very romantic and beautifully arranged. There is usually a wait to be seated at the Cheesecake factory. Especially after 7pm. However, it is definitely worth trying. They serve you bread with your dinner and offer great drinks to choose from. There is a bar area for those looking to come for drinks and a quick bite. They also offer a ""skinnylicious""menu for people that are on a diet.  It is a very broad menu. Some dishes are better than others. If you try what I suggested, I am sure you will be happy because it was very good. Stay away from the spinach and artichoke dip and the pot stickers.

While we waited, we were lucky to get two seats at the bar. Only to sit next to several angry customers who were eating at the bar because their waits had been so long. The bar staff was lackluster and more interested in talking to each other than helping customers. Then the real disaster started when we were seated. It took way too long to get anyone to stop at our table for water or to take a drink order. Once we finally ordered, the appetizers came and were just OK. Our entrees came, and the hamburger ordered medium came out looking like beyond well done. That took a long time to find our new server (they changed servers for some reason) she took it back and said they would make a new one. By the time the new one came, everyone had finished their dinners. It was also improperly cooked - rare on the inside and burned on the outside.

It isn't exclusive to this location and its not the fault of the staff/owners that the restaurant is popular, especially on the weekends. In terms of food, everything is mostly good.

349,cedes w.,"JAMAICA, United States",2,66,3.0,1.0,2016-12-06,"My husband, mother, children and I visited the cheesecake factory at Ridgehill this past week. We visited due to my husband's birthday and my daughter's graduation (This was my husband's first time at any cheesecake factory). From the beginning, I was disappointed with the service and quality of the food. As it being a weekday (Tuesday), it wasn't very busy and we were seated almost immediately outside (upon our request). EVERY SINGLE THING we wanted, I had to call the waiter over to get. I had to find him to get our appetizers in, call him over to get our drinks ordered, request water, ask for him to come so we could get our entree order in. He simply neglected our table. When it got a little chilly, we asked for the heater to be turned on. When the heater turned off, we asked the waiter to turn it back on. He said okay but walked back inside. We had to request the manager when he walked by to help us and turn it on. To add insult to injury half of the time, the waiter was just standing around at the other end of the patio. One other thing that bothered me was that I asked for a glass of water and I told him it was my husband's birthday and I would like for him to get sung happy birthday at the table. He said okay. The food came (much smaller portions than the Nyack and White Plains location) and we finished. He came and just gave us the bill. There was no asking of if we wanted dessert, no asking if we wanted anything else and certainly no happy birthday for my husband. I became infuriated because once I gave him my card he literally stood next to our table eyeing the tip. So lets recap, I had to ask for everything for our meal, you never returned regarding our heater, and didn't sing happy birthday as I requested. We will never be returning to the cheesecake factory at this location ever again. People come to the cheesecake factory for a delicious special meal to share with friends and family. If I wanted to ask for everything or get it myself I could have cooked at home.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=160,2.6,2.7,2.724,1.924,2.66

We were seated and sat and sat for over 10 minutes no one acknowledged us or came to our table,so I went to the hostess and asked her if  someone was assigned to us???She said yes there should be and she walked off  to find out. A minute later this waiter comes over and says I will be your waiter now. I was already aggravated but was glad that we were finally getting service. The waiter took our drink orders and it took like 15 more minutes to get the drinks he forgot our water. He was walking around as if he had no energy or just didn't want to be there,he looked like he could not pick up his feet while walking very lazy! He brought the bread and took our food order. the manager comes over to tell me there is a problem with my order not the right sauce, I said thats fine I will take it.That food took 30 minutes to come and when it came it was cold and did not taste good.

411,Renee R.,"Manhattan, United States",3,69,94.0,1.0,2017-05-07,"Ok let's start off by saying this: my server was really nice and she was just simply overwhelmed with how busy the restaurant was. When I spoke to the Mgr he was a total moron who knew the place was bad with service and there was nothing he could do to manage it because he has no manager skills clearly. He didn't even give a crap when I told him your service in the kitchens are horrible. But let's begin. Went in with my friend and our 3 kids. Ordered kids meals an app plus our food. Kids meals were wrong they brung out only the protein that was ordered but everything else was wrong wrong and wrong. They get their food & it's loaded with pepper. Like rediculously spicy and peppery for 5 year olds (and my kid loves hot sauce) asked for ranch instead we get ketchup. His grilled chicken was pathetic it was like 4 bites of a chicken. By the time 2/3 kids were half way done the 3rd child meal comes along. Mind you weve been there 45m at this time My friend and I are waiting and waiting for our meals. After an hour we ate all our app and starting to really lose it. Hour 15 goes by kids are over the whole experience they're done eating and losing their patience. No crayons or anything to entertain while we painfully wait for our food. Hour and a half later we ask her wth where's the food?? She explains Someone took mine to the wrong table and had her salad sitting under a hot light for 30mins. Asked if we wanted to wait for them to remake mine obviously the answer was a hell no way!!! We pack my friends salad which was hot and sitting around for 30mins which I don't think she should have had to pay for. We paid for everything literally everything expect my meal since it never came. And that was that we waited 2 hour, we spent $75 on 3 kids meals which were garbage a wilted salad that sat waiting to be served for over 30mins and chips w/guac .

We then waited an hour for our food (it wasn't even crowded). I took a few bites of my pasta and the waiter came and said it was a mistake and took it away. He then gave me another dish which looked less appetizing and looked like someone had eaten part of it. I asked him about it and he was very rude to me.

Fast forward another 15 minutes, by then my party had finished their meals and still no food for me!!! I stop the manager to tell him this is utterly ridiculous everyone has finished their meals and mine still hasn't arrived. He acts like he going to see what's going on but never returns. I now stop my waiter to tell him cancel the order because by this point I'm angry annoyed and no longer even hungry . The manager never returned to my table to even apologize or offer anything in return for such disgusting service. Needless to stay I will NEVER return to this Cheesecake Factory again!!!

22,Renee R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,69,94.0,1.0,2017-07-05,"Ok let's start off by saying this: my server was really nice and she was just simply overwhelmed with how busy the restaurant was. When I spoke to the Mgr he was a total moron who knew the place was bad with service and there was nothing he could do to manage it because he has no manager skills clearly. He didn't even give a crap when I told him your service in the kitchens are horrible. But let's begin. Went in with my friend and our 3 kids. Ordered kids meals an app plus our food. Kids meals were wrong they brung out only the protein that was ordered but everything else was wrong wrong and wrong. They get their food & it's loaded with pepper. Like rediculously spicy and peppery for 5 year olds (and my kid loves hot sauce) asked for ranch instead we get ketchup. His grilled chicken was pathetic it was like 4 bites of a chicken. By the time 2/3 kids were half way done the 3rd child meal comes along. Mind you weve been there 45m at this time My friend and I are waiting and waiting for our meals. After an hour we ate all our app and starting to really lose it. Hour 15 goes by kids are over the whole experience they're done eating and losing their patience. No crayons or anything to entertain while we painfully wait for our food. Hour and a half later we ask her wth where's the food?? She explains Someone took mine to the wrong table and had her salad sitting under a hot light for 30mins. Asked if we wanted to wait for them to remake mine obviously the answer was a hell no way!!! We pack my friends salad which was hot and sitting around for 30mins which I don't think she should have had to pay for. We paid for everything literally everything expect my meal since it never came. And that was that we waited 2 hour, we spent $75 on 3 kids meals which were garbage a wilted salad that sat waiting to be served for over 30mins and chips w/guac .  Thanks Cheesecake Factory that was the SHITTIEST EXPERIENCE EVERRRRRRRRR!!!! You really take the crown on that one.

584,Princess R.,"Bronx, Bronx, United States",0,2,,1.0,2017-07-13,"My experience at this location yesterday wasn't very pleasant. I sat at a table with my family for at least 15mins before a server came and greeted us. When the server (Kiy) did greet us he introduced himself and said "" I guess I'm going to take this table because no one else is"". We then ordered three waters one with lemon and a Dr Pepper. Another 15mins went by and still no beverages. He approached the table and we jokingly said did you forget about us? He responses in telling us that they were no cups in the restaurant and that they were short a dishwasher. We told him it was okay to just give us the drinks in to go cups and ordered a pina colada, some apps and our food. 10mins after that he brings our drinks not including the pina colada (which I figured he was going to the bar to get so I didn't bring it up at that moment) or lemon for one of the waters. At this point we were annoyed and didn't want to ask our server for nothing more because it seemed like a bother to him as he continued to past our table and pay us no mind. The appetizers came out and were delicious but once our entrees came everything started going downhill again. Our food did not come out all together. When the last person got her food half of what she ordered wasn't there. We were told that it would be up in a second. 3 out of 4 of us had pasta so we asked for cheese and did not receive it neither. Then finally a manager walks by I'm guessing to touch base and explain to us why the pot stickers we ordered were still not there. He explained that the kitchen was short staff and they had to make the pot stickers from scratch which honestly should have been explained to us rather than having us thinking everything was under control. I'm beyond frustrated at this point and tell them to cancel that order of pot stickers. I then continue to explain to the manager (warren) that we weren't getting anything we ask for this whole night. No pina colada, no lemon, no cheese, no pot stickers and on top of all that horrible service. Little things could have made up for this bad experience but not one time did Kiy try to turn our experience around. When it was time for the bill the manager had to take off the pina colada that we never received and the pot stickers he also discounted a lot off our bill which we very much appreciated but the managers should not be held accountable every time a server can't seem to get it together. If he was communicating with us I'm pretty sure we would of understood a little more. After speaking to the manager for a while he learned it was my older cousins birthday and got her a cheese cake on the house which put a smile on her face.

We then waited an hour for our food (it wasn't even crowded). I took a few bites of my pasta and the waiter came and said it was a mistake and took it away. He then gave me another dish which looked less appetizing and looked like someone had eaten part of it. I asked him about it and he was very rude to me.
