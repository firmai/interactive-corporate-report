7,Rosanna G.,"Redwood City, CA",0,74,,1.0,2013-07-05,I've eaten there twice. Worst meal from an Applebee's twice. Tuscaloosa is the place chains go to die.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
6,Kat L.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",1,11,,4.0,2013-07-27,"My husband & I had dinner here last night & it was great. The food was excellent & our server was awesome. The manager was even stopping by tables to make sure everything was up to par. If you're a drinker, the Mango Long Island Iced Tea is amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
4,MustangQT M.,"Houston, TX",9,123,,1.0,2013-09-13,"People don't go to Applebee's for the food. I mean if you put menus from Chili's, Applebee's and TGIFridays, it would be hard to tell the difference. People go to Applebee's for the drinks and the atmosphere. Well...those two areas are seriously lacking.  Berry Sangria was watery and not that good. Food was either greasy or very bland. And atmosphere...let me put it like this. It was dead. On a Saturday night. With football games on. Oh and the real gem? A waitress out in the open crying into her coworker's shoulder. What? Professionalism much? The whole experience totaled up into a big waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
5,Liz G.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",149,24,5.0,2.0,2015-02-07,"Mediocre service. Our table was forgotten about because as we were told four times, ""our server was very busy with another party."" The manager, Jason, came to attend to our table which we thought meant we'd have excellent service since our waitress couldn't attend to us. We were wrong. This just meant our mozzarella sticks were rushed out to appease us for the poor service thus far. The mozzarella sticks weren't completely done and while somewhat cooked the cheese was just a solid block in some sticks. We didn't want to bother our swamped waitress so we ate the cooked sticks and awaited our food. When our food came the wings looked great and the pasta looked great as well. Except it was covered in bruschetta which I asked to be left from my meal. The manager was more than happy to have a new dish made which I was grateful for. The food came back out within 5 minutes and at first glance and bite tasted delicious. As I made my way to the middle of my plate my ziti pasta either hadn't been drained all the way or had been washed off and re-sauced. I brought my suspicions to the managers attention and he assured me this was not the case and he'd be happy to make me another one or refund my individual meal. He was extremely apologetic and made every attempt to rectify the situation including a voucher for $20 towards next time. While this was much appreciated it just doesn't change our experience. Unfortunately this is the only Applebee's in town. Well more than likely use the $20 for something to-go next time and not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
3,Naomi W.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",39,4,3.0,4.0,2016-02-15,"Went here Valentine's night because the wait was ridiculous everywhere else. Found 2 seats at the bar immediately. Although busy, the bartender immediately took out drink orders and offered food menus. The entree wound up coming before the appetizer so the bartender asked the manager to not charge us for it even though we did not complain.  Thanks a bunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
2,Hadley H.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",445,1,,1.0,2016-08-19,YALL!! We called Applebee's and they said they accepted bama cash once we got here and finished our $80 meal they no longer accepted bama cash. My boyfriend did not have his wallet so he had to drive home to get his credit card come back and pay for it. Besides the fact food and the drinks were amazing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
0,Larry C.,"Demopolis, AL",39,33,50.0,5.0,2017-05-27,Great time while out for the Memorial Weekend. We had the two for $25 from the menu. It was hot when it came out and I loved the green beans and fries. Latisha was our server and she kept coming back to the table to check on us. We will be back! Great job Latisha.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
1,Gianna B.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-16,"Every time I have come here the service has been terrible. I end up waiting 15 minutes to be greeted by a server, or I have to ask someone to get my drink order. On top of that, I went in today and the hostess was sitting at the host stand, eating, did not say a single word to me and took me to a table, threw the menus down and walked away. I ordered my appetizers and they came out after the food. Everything always comes out cold and needs to be sent back. I waited 15 extra minutes for the food to come out lukewarm. I am a server myself and this place is always horrendous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tuscaloosa-4,,,,,
