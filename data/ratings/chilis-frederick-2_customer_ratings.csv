6,Larry S.,"Frederick, MD",7,62,66.0,4.0,2016-03-19,"Praise the restaurant gods Frederick has a Chillies!  Yes Frederick it's true, it's a glorious day as the restaurant gods have blessed us with our very own.  We all know that this is a chain, but OMG it's a good one and we deserve it right. They have great  food, and you can't beat their specials in be bar. The menu is diverse enough to satisfy most tastes and if an adult beverage is your desire, they got that covered.  Look it's all good and while they are working out the opening kinks, I am sure they will be a solid place to chill and enjoy a good meal and cold beverage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
15,Randy M.,"Frederick, MD",2,13,,3.0,2016-03-22,For opening week they did a good job. Staff still new but did a very well. Food was good and tasty and it was a delightful experience. Will definitely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
12,Shuarez A.,"Montgomery Village, MD",12,6,15.0,5.0,2016-03-22,Great addition to Frederick! The experience and food was much better than Rockville location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
17,Jojo M.,"Frederick, MD",0,4,,1.0,2016-03-29,"I did call ahead seating, I received a text my table was ready!! I walk up to hostess table only to be told my table was just given away?!! What the heck?? Takes our waitress 10-15 to come and great and take our drink order when that takes forever we order appetizer it wasn't until I asked waitress if she had placed the order out appetizer come out 20 minutes later. After being here for over 1 hour and half we were told waitress forgot to put in order after another 15-20 minutes waiting which took for over to get drink refills. We then were told after being at this stupid place that it would be another 25 minutes to get our food if I could give them a zero or negative # I would!!! Not worth you visiting crappy place crappy service!!!! I would never come back again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
13,Byron O.,"Frederick, MD",0,3,,5.0,2016-03-29,FREDERICK IT'S HERE! FINALLY! Came in for lunch with the better half. Service was outstanding as was the food. I absent mindedly brought in an Appelbee's coupon when the manager saw it he came over to point out that it was not a Chillies coupon but honored for us anyway. I am so happy we now have a Chillies. We will be back with friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
9,Leilani R.,"Ballenger Creek, MD",11,65,127.0,2.0,2016-04-03,"Having been open for a very short time, they still need lots of work. Expected? I suppose. Our meal ended up being free along with the table next to us. They got the steak orders wrong. The other table ended up eating our steak (unbeknownst to us) because they were hungry. It was when they brought out our steak the other table spoke up after we said it was wrong. They said they didn't complain only because they were hungry and didn't want to wait again.  The other review is about their bathrooms. If you've read my previous reviews you will know cleanliness of bathrooms is important. Both the men and women were trashed. There was even an employee washing up after use and didn't say or take action to get it cleaned after walking out. Staff should take ownership of where they work. Why wouldn't you want your own place of work to be presentable?  It keeps guests coming back! Our original waiter never came back after taking our order and neither did the manager who said our meals were on the house after the mistake.  So.....we just walked out.  Needs work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
16,Christopher R.,"Woodsboro, MD",74,2,,4.0,2016-04-28,"Came to meet my wife and daughter for an early dinner. When I showed up they had been seated for 15 minutes and no wait staff had even been to the table.  My daughter had flagged down a passing server but still no one has come by.  I said something to the hostess' who looked like deer in headlights.  About 5 minutes later 2 of the hostess came over and attempted to get us drinks.  I asked for a manager and when she came over she was apologetic. Basically we had been sat in a section where the server had no shown up.  A server cane over a minute later, saying although this wasn't his section he'd help us out. Joey was very helpful and insured that we had everything we needed.  The food was as we remembered it, so that wasn't an issue.  The issue was the hostess just didn't have a clue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
18,A R.,"Thurmont, MD",0,2,,5.0,2016-05-06,We had never been to a chili's before and came for the first time we had a great time it was great looking place .

19,Cassandra D.,"Frederick, MD",125,3,,3.0,2016-05-06,It's an alright place.  Nice staff. Strange seating arrangements though.  Place was clean.  Food was meh though.  Same exact eggrolls from BJs lol... salads need more work.  The kitchen staff really need to pick up the pace though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
10,Liz P.,"Frederick, MD",0,52,,2.0,2016-05-09,"Annnnd Chilis is still a mess. I went here again because my mom wanted to go here. Literally, the best part about our meal was the chips and salsa.  When arriving, there were like 15 people crowded in the doorway with clearly empty tables throughout the restaurant. People kept asking the hostess why there were empty tables, and the hostess kept saying ""hold on, my manager is mapping out the tables now""...20 mins later.... the crowd cleared out, and we were still sitting there.  My mom asks how much longer the wait, and the girl goes "" We sat you at a high top table in the bar, is that okay?""  Uhm no, its not. We have a 4 year old. Then, immediately, they sit us at a booth that was open the entire time we were waiting?  We order, our waitress was nice. First we got another table's food- sent it back.  Next, half of our order is right, half of it is STILL wrong- sent it back again. Then, my mom's food came back cold...like it had literally been sitting out all day.  The manager was nice enough to come over and comp our meal. Still....what is going on with this place? Get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
8,Steve M.,"Frederick, MD",0,8,2.0,2.0,2016-05-13,"When to Happy Hour today, was greeted at the front and taken to the bar. Server came over in about 5 minutes; told us the specials and seemed nice. We ordered a draft and a daiquiri. Drinks came in 15 minutes, 3 bartenders were not busy. Ordered a couple of appetizers. Took 20 minutes for food to arrive. Guac and salsa were fine, chips were a bit greasy and stale.  The sliders were very greasy as well. Ordered a draft, after 7 minutes I went to the bar to inquire, I mean a 16 ounce draft in a not so busy bar, and it wasn't even cold Way too slow and greasy food, disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
4,John F.,"Charles Town, WV",0,7,2.0,1.0,2016-07-31,"What a shame. Chili's used to be a good place to eat. No more. Ordered a ""craft burger"". Turned out to be a cr@p burger! Way, way over done. Bun was rock hard. They did make another one but it was worse than the first. Over cooked. No tomato , onion, or sauce. Fries were semi-lukewarm. Wife had a SantaFe salad. Entirely to much wrong to list here.  But gotta give credit where it's due. The waiter, Brad, was tremendous. Knowledgeable, understanding, and a really nice guy.  Will we be back. Probably not. Way to many other places to go. It's a shame cuz they do have a great tequila list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
3,Bindu M.,"Evanston, IL",2,8,,2.0,2016-10-24,"Service is very slow and quality of food isn't Very great.  I was extremely happy to see one in Fredrick area but kinda haven't gone back after the two times I was there. Something doesn't feel the same, the staff , the food And the alcohol.  All are very average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
11,Bob V.,"Keedysville, MD",0,4,,1.0,2016-12-21,Had lunch with some friends.  Service was good meal sucks it's 6 hour's later and I still feel like vomiting. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
2,Monica T.,"Frederick, MD",111,54,22.0,5.0,2017-04-23,"This was my first time at the Frederick location! It was great, I love the trivia and the ability to pay without waiting for our server. The food was tasty and the drinks too. :) I'll go back and hope to have the same experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
5,Jordan R.,"Germantown, MD",0,5,,1.0,2017-05-19,"Well, third time is a charm and we won't be back again. Husband's burger was over cooked 2 out of the 3 times we've come, and this time it was like a charcoal brick. Last time it took almost an hour to get us 2 burgers, and it wasn't that busy at all. They comped our meal last time so we decided to give it another shot tonight. Bad idea. Our server was wonderful, however, it still took 45 minutes for a burger and a plain cheese quesadilla.  Nothing fancy. Nothing extra. The quesadilla was gross, and it had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long until the burger was ready. Long enough to cook the lettuce and pico de gaio that came with it, and the cheese was super hard and crispy and disgusting. Seriously disappointed.  There are much better places in the area to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
7,D J.,"Frederick, MD",1,4,,1.0,2017-07-20,"This is my second time here, the first time was during there opening week and the food was grossed then but I figured since it's been sometime now maybe things have changed, well I was wrong. Food was cold and nasty! Order a burger that came out basically raw and my husband food was so bland and cold we couldn't even believe it considering they weren't even busy. Service isn't prompted and the servers don't seem to really care about the customer unless it comes to there tip money, our drinks also tasted watered down. If I could put negative stars I would bc it's just purely gross. Won't be returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
14,Destiny N.,"Frederick, MD",3,3,,1.0,2017-07-30,"The service was horrible tonight. We sat and waited for a server to come over for 15 minutes or more. When she did come we asked for water and drinks, the drinks came and no water. We ordered sweet tea, but they gave us regular tea. When we asked for another one and our water we were told they ran out of sugar for the sweet tea, but use the sugar packets on the table...lol when our food came it was lukewarm. We barely saw our server the rest of the time we were there until she brought The check and asked if we were okay.  I guess it was a good thing we didn't actually want to order anything else. The people sitting across from us waited for a server forever. Finally someone came over and said he would help them and apologized for not knowing what happened to their server. It was 6:00pm in the evening the parking lot was not full, you would think there would have been better service. Never again will we go back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
0,Benjamin B.,"Hurricane, WV",1,12,1.0,3.0,2017-10-08,"In the area, just passing through for a wedding.  We were all starved and just looking for something to eat that wasn't fast food.  We pulled into Chili's, but before walking in I pulled up ""Yelp!"" After reading the various reviews, I must say I was a bit apprehensive.  That and I don't think I had been to a Chili's in 10+ years.  However, I walked away thinking they were a bit harsh.  In all honesty and in my opinion, any problems this location is having; roots solely in management and the kitchen.   Our orders were taken and just took a long time to be brought to the table.  Food was warm and the correct temperature,  and correct.    1.) Chipotle Mex bowl -  DELICIOUS and had a nice little kick!   2.) Sliders - based on the yelp I was worried about this one, but they were spot on.   3.) Fajitas -  honestly, perfectly cooked.   Our service (Owen was our server) was great.  Our server was a bit overwhelmed, as he had a 10 top and then we were seated (4top) and then another 4 top immediately after us.  It was apparent there was just way too much going on for one person, and so a coworker slid over to help out and took down our orders.  (I was actually very impressed with this initiative).  This is why I would say this is a management issue,  NOT a staff issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
1,Rainna J.,"New Market, MD",0,11,,5.0,2018-01-09,"I tried this place first time with my family on New year morning time as both I hops had a wait time of 1 hr. This place was not crazy busy and had a excellent service , we ordered Salmon , pasta , fries with salad every thing tasted great and spacious restaurant with great family environment. Will not forget to mention they have 4 main deserts and all are excellent.I forgot name of desert I had but that one was featured one on menu list and it was tasty. It was definitely more expensive than I hop but we enjoyed here with family.I will highly recommend this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick-2,,,,,
