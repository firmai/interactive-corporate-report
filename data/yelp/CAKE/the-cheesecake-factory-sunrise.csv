Brandon M.,"Davie, FL",82,25,79,4.0,11/21/2017,"Ahhh The Cheesecake Factory..  always an excellent choice no matter what mood you are in.  There is so much variety in the menu here that you don't have to pick a ""type"" of restaurant.  If you want Italian style food, they have it.  Asian? They have it.  American? They have it plus much more.  To top it off, you will have some of the best dessert options in town when you are done!  If it's available in the fall, go for the pumpkin cheesecake!  If you're not concerned about an overly healthy meal, I highly recommend trying the fried Mac and cheese.  Words can't describe this dish so I won't try.  Also, if you want a drink, you have to try the whisky smash.  It might be my favorite drink in the world.  It's strong enough to get the party started for anyone, but soft enough that a light drinker will also enjoy.  The only problem here is that there's almost always a solid wait time because, well, it's worth it.  If you haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory yet then you're obviously living under a rock.  Get yourself there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise
Kiona B.,"Hollywood, FL",187,38,186,2.0,9/25/2017,"Who can go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory, I thought. I'm a fan, but not with this location. You know when you're craving one specific thing and only want that one thing? Well, that was me yesterday. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan speciality and was informed well after ordering my meal that it wasn't available. Ok, I regrouped but the only thing that saved me was the sweet tamale cakes (appetizer for $10.95).  My son ordered a side Cesar salad and when it was brought to him they realized it was for the table behind us. My son pulled his fork from the salad and returned it only to get another salad 10 minutes later. I believe the croutons are sautéed and were waaaaaay too hard to chew.  I'll just stick with the Cheesecake Factory in my neck of the woods.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise

Tina Y.,"Miami, FL",161,36,63,4.0,1/5/2018,"We decided to sit at the bar for faster seating during this busy lunch break. I had stuffed mushroom to start off and had chicken Marsala and mango salad. We had actually ordered buffalo chicken and it was like smothered chicken battered and deep fried. The sizes were huge but had to take it back. The manager came by to check, thought it was professional of him. The other items we ordered was delicious. We had couple wines and enjoyed our lunch. I'd come back when I'm in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise
David P.,"Sunrise, FL",1,22,18,2.0,1/11/2018,"I've been at this Cheesecake a few times, food is cooked well. Servers are polite and attend well. However, I feel like the manager can offer some type of minor customer service to compensate for mistakes. On my last visit my wife and I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (one of our favorites), the kitchen staff forgot to add the Shrimp to the meal. We decided to have them cook the shrimp and added to the meal. Meanwhile, the manager on staff on Thursday night came by while we waited and only offered a simple apology. After which, 15 minutes we received 4 miniature shrimps. Very disappointing. I hope that the next customer can be treated a little better for the mistake. The server on the other hand, was very polite and did her job well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise
Kike A.,"Miami, FL",147,13,6,1.0,10/22/2017,"I usually don't like to leave negative reviews due to the fact that I am in the industry and I understand that things happen.  But for me to get up an leave, was a result of too many mistakes.  First, it took the server 3 tries to bring a diet coke. He kept mixing the drinks and delivering regular coke. Brown bread was not available.  I order chicken and waffles and received eggs benedict, and to top it off, we order penne carbonara and the plate had a mix of spaghetti and penne pasta.  At this point our appetite was gone and decided to leave.  I remember that good old Cheesecake Factory, it was the place to go, but now the quality and service has gone down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise
Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1608,475,1689,3.0,4/13/2017,"This place was packed and so was the mall. There was a wait for regular tables so we sat at the bar where you can order from the full menu. The bartenders (2) were a little overwhelmed as they were making the  drinks for the entire restaurant as well as waiting on patrons eating. I was surprised how many people were having (multiple) alcoholic beverages at lunch -- although most were tourists here on vacation. The menu is quite large and it takes a while to go through it. There's also a list of ""specials"" -- prices are the same on the regular menu so I guess it's just items they are featuring or pushing. Then there's a separate one for skinnylicious meals. These are ""lighter"" versions of menu items. Although that may not mean much. Calories are listed next to most items and if people really paid attention to the numbers some items would never be ordered. Eek! Inside the regular menu is a section -- buried a few pages back and on the lower half of one page -- that lists lunch specials with smaller portions of some items and combos like soups and sandwiches, et al.  I ordered off the skinnylicious menu and got a ""factory"" chopped salad. It had romaine lettuce, bits of avocado, bits of bacon, corn kernels, a smidgen of blue cheese, a few tiny bits of apples, and a few cubes of cooked white chicken meat. It came already mixed with a vinaigrette style dressing. It was a fairly large bowl (with 500 calories). I gave part of it away and basically picked out the pieces of chicken and avocado.  It wasn't bad, but not sure I would order it again.  This is not fine dining and you wonder how they can control such a large menu and do all the things correctly. It's loud and busy. It's not a place to linger and chat, but at least it's slightly better alternative to food court dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise
Rosa L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",283,108,722,4.0,8/29/2017,"My daughter and I went where in the mood for the National Cheese and there and behold we went on a Sunday during brunch. As always it was packed with people, but more crowed for the special event of National Cheesecake. We had food and the new cheesecake to celebrate life together. I also tried a Peach Bellini, which was refreshing while in the outside seating area. The waitress was very nice the service time was not too fast not too slow. We definitely were stuffed when leaving. My 10 year old daughter did mention the bathroom was not as clean as it should be. The time we had here is always special. I'm glad its at a mall so we could walk off some calories. I will be back if out at Sawgrass shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise
Howard H.,"Dania Beach, FL",533,457,3160,4.0,3/26/2017,"My wife and I came here for lunch after walking around the all morning.  It's been a while since I visited this Cheesecake Factory last, probably 5 or 6 years.  But surprisingly, this place looked the same and hasn't change at all from my memory. I am amazed how they managed to keep the place look this good after all these years.  We went to the bar and it looked exactly the way I remembered The menu hasn't changed much neither.  The only differences is before  I used to order the dinner entrees and asked for the lunch portion., but now  there is a lunch special menu.  Since they have just a few beers on top, I decided to order their mojito.  It tasted pretty good but perhaps it was a bit pricey.  I should come back during their happy hours where the same drink will cost probably half of the regular price.  My wife ordered her Long Island Ice Teas as usual.  She thought they were pretty good. For lunch we tried a few items in their appetizer menu.  I love egg rolls so I ordered their egg roll samplers which came with 4 different kinds of egg rolls with 4 different kind of sauces.  They were all very crispy on the outside and the fillings were delicious.  My wife ordered the Tomato Basil Flat Bread and enjoyed it.  And also, how can you come to Cheesecake Factory without ordering a cheesecake?  My wife ordered their White Chocolate Carmela Macadamia Nut Cheesecake.  She apparently loved it because she was worried so much about the calories in the cheesecake.  She thought the carmela might be a bit too sweet.  Overall, we liked our meal.  The drinks were good, and so was the service.  I think we would come back during their happy hours for great deals on food and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise

Our waiter (Michael P) was great!  He was awesome about checking on us.  We promptly received coffee and water refills.  He was super polite too!  He gets 5 out of 5 stars.  My husband and I agree that he was one of the best waiters we have had at this particular establishment. I think the kitchen was slow or backed up, it took a little bit of time for the food to come out.  The quality of the food was good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise

As I was being seated (alone), I realized I left my book in the care.  I rarely eat alone without reading material but my server happened to be there and ensured me he would take good care of me and even allow me to order from the lunch menu... it was only a minute or 2 before 4/ He didn't disappoint.  He was quite busy but do follow through and I had a great piece of salmon at the lower price.  Yummy and happy to save a little.

Dawn C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,,2.0,12/26/2017,"So tonight I went out to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Sawgrass Mills Mall expecting to have a good dining experience. Well that didn't happen. I ordered fish tacos and the dish was $15.50. So I expected a decent amount of fish. Maybe at least amounting to one fish steak spread over the 4 tacos I received. I was so disappointed when I looked at my dish and the pieces of fish all together that were in my meal didn't even make up an average size fish steak. To top it off the rice was still hard . I was so upset , so I asked for the manager, who insisted that it was a normal portion of fish for their tacos.  I did not expect that from this restaurant chain. I normally love the portions you get whether you eat in or take out.  And this was not on the lighter menu section, so they really dropped the ball here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise
Wendy P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",30,4,2,2.0,7/1/2017,I received Chicken Nachos via delivery tonight from door dash. They were thrown in a pizza box with no toppings except cheese and chicken.

Faith K.,"Plantation, FL",222,131,107,2.0,6/16/2017,"Where do I begin with this nightmare?  Stopped in at lunchtime on a Tuesday. I was with 3 colleagues and we were seated in the bar area. As we were seated, I said we were on our lunch hour and we would like separate checks.  The waitress eventually took our order.  Three of us ordered salads and one person ordered 2 appetizers as a meal.  The table next to us was seated about 10 minutes later and we watched them get served their hot meals. As the waitress was MIA, we went to inquire about our food as we were still on our lunch break.  The food finally came (as the table next to us finished their meals) and the hot appetizers that my friend ordered were room temperature.  I ordered Sheila's Chicken and avocado salad and I am here to tell you that there was no chicken and a few diced pieced of avocado. It took a while to flag down the server and she said she would go get me some ""extra"" chicken. I explained it was not ""extra"" as there was no chicken in the salad. I don't think she understood... My friend ate his appetizers because it was such a hassle to get my salad corrected.  Then the manager came over with 2 bowls of chicken and told me this was my ""extra"" chicken. I looked at him with amazement. Seriously, just adding the chicken to the salad is not okay as it does not have any of the flavors melded into it.  He offered to re-toss it as it would only take ""a minute"" - I agreed to have it re-tossed. However, due to the length of time, I took one bite and asked for it to go as it was getting late.  When the server came back, she inquired if we wanted the check ""split by 4"" and I said I had previously requested separate checks.  She again asked if we wanted it ""split by 4"" - There was a serious disconnect so one of my friends took over. A few minutes later she came out with a piece of cheesecake (sadly the person most wanted cheesecake, does not like the coffee flavored cheesecake.  I, personally, don't even like cheesecake. So, my friends picked at the cheesecake, my salad was off the check and we were out to lunch a lot longer that it should have been.  I don't foresee returning anytime in the near future.  There are way too many other places in the area that we can eat at more quickly with less aggravation.  I was sad as I have always enjoyed the salads and the brown bread  at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=20

Marcos M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,15,,1.0,11/3/2017,Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I would go there at least once or twice a month visiting all South Florida locations. I won't give up on it yet but my 2 most recent visits indicate there's a problem that needs to be fixed. Prices have inched up to depart from casual dining into the fine dining category which it definitely does not compete in. The shrimp scampi and Bistro shrimp ordered on the last 2 visits are just under $20 and come with pasta only. The shrimp are medium size not large or jumbo. On 1 different occasions the food was served cold. Inexcusable. Service has gone down hill. No checking back to follow up. Appetizers were ok but overpriced. The cheesecake is still the highlight of the meal. As far as food it was a major disappointment. I won't give up but will not return to the Sawgrass location for a while.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=20
Arturo M.,"Plantation, FL",74,35,35,1.0,4/30/2017,"Was disappointed in this place. Not a fan of ""franchise"" type eateries, but I thought this would be different.  The place was packed and we got a table that was slanted because the floor was kind of on a hill. I asked to be moved and was not accommodated even though there was 3 empty tables right behind ours. Food was blah.. My wife ordered a salad with NO onions.. Emphasized this numerous times. Even joked about it saying watch it have onions...Food comes and guess what it has...... ONIOnS!!! We waited for the waiter and my wife begins to pick out the onions. The waiter strolls over and I proceed to tell him there are onions and he apologizes and asks if she wanted another one. By now she is half way through the salad and was done eating it... Would make no sense getting another. We just ask for the bill. No apologies for the delay, no cares whatsoever. Bill comes and the salad wasn't even offered to be removed. No problem though. Cheesecake factory enjoy that $13.99. You'll never get another dime from me.

The staff is pleasant and welcoming. We had a great experience with the service and food. My only concern was almost all of the utensils were visible dirty. One of the forks had a creamy sauce on it.

Deb G.,"Washington, DC",126,540,532,3.0,10/18/2016,"I have visited the Cheesecake Factory more in the last few months than in the last few years because a few of my friends here in FL are fans. I'm generally a lot happier in hole in the wall ethnic places than big chain restaurants, but I can't deny that the huge menu at Cheesecake Factory makes it easy for people with disparate tastes to eat together. In order to skip the wait on a Friday night, we opted to eat outside - luckily it was sort of nice outside. It was crazy busy, and I'm not sure if that was a typical evening or because it was the day after Hurricane Matthew luckily missed us. Our waitress was delightful and funny, and even though service was a bit slower than I expected because of our out-of-the-way seats, she definitely checked in on us regularly. Now, to the food. Stepping outside my comfort zone, I got the grilled chicken tostada salad. their description: Crisp Corn Tortillas Topped with Grilled Marinated Chicken Breast and Black Beans Piled High with Mixed Greens, Fresh Corn, Green Onions and Cilantro All Tossed in Our Vinaigrette and Garnished with Avocado Cream, Salsa and Sour Cream. When it arrived, I received a huge, huge, massively huge plate of salad greens. Everything else was buried by the salad. Eventually, I unearthed two little tostadas with grilled chicken and black beans on them, and piles of corn and tomatoes that looked and tasted like pico de gallo. So here's the problem - it's served with balsamic vinaigrette. Do you put pico and balsamic together? I don't. After I got a different dressing (BBQ Ranch), it was enjoyable, even though I felt like most of my evening was spent trying to find the different components of my salad. Don't think I'll get that one again. However, it did provide not one but TWO more meals, so I can't complain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=20

Was impressed by the menu, so much stuff. A lot of cheesecakes to chose from as well. We had an ""Original"" and a ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"". The slices are huge, and you could feed a family of four with the two slices we ordered. For that, and cappuccino and a soda, we payed about $ 25, not cheap, but not too bad, and within prices of other chain restaurants. Plus the place was clean and had a nice decor, unlike some other chain restaurants. Our server was a fairly nice guy, but the place was really crowded, and, at time, was kind hard to get a hold of him.

Krizia L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",269,127,368,2.0,11/8/2015,"I think that pretty much every local knows that cheesecake factory here is pretty terrible and a mess when it comes to wait times and a little on service. Worst part is parking and the wait times. This is foreigner and out of towner central. Long story short, got here at 6:30 pm Saturday night for a table for 7. They told us it would be a 30min to 40 min wait. They kept extending the time and we ended up sitting about an hour and a half later. Terrible. Been here many times but it hasn't gotten this bad. Our food took a while. By the time we got it, I already lost my appetite. We were stuffing ourselves with their delicious bread and butter. Price wise, they're okay. Their portions are definitely big and you get your moneys worth or even more at times. Their food is great though. I'll give them that. My favorite is the Farfalle bowtie pasta and shrimp scampi. Their  complimentary bread and butter always served hot and delicious. Their calamari is absolutely delicious too. Lastly they really bring the name of cheesecake very well. My favorite is the red velvet and white chocolate. But because this is foreigner central, a lot of the diners here have luggage they carry with them and it gets crowded and a lot of families. CHAOTIC atmosphere. Disorganized wait time system and hostess even though they have the beeper. This place is not worth going to, to get a peaceful nice date during traffic hours.

Melanie B.,"Hollywood, FL",27,7,,1.0,11/21/2017,I live across the street from the Sawgrass mall. My husband and I have gone frequently to the Cheesecake Factory. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had here. First we arrived on a Tuesday evening at 7:30. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait. So by the time we were seated it was 35 min later. The hostess seats us at a table for four people with only 3 chairs and walks away leaving us standing there missing a chair. We had to take it upon ourselves to find a chair. It took another 30 min to get drinks and our appetizer came out before the bread. The waiter was inattentive in all aspects. We ended up not even having dessert because we were afraid we would've been stuck there waiting for another 30 min. Such a shame this place has gone downhill. I didn't even get into the fact that all the food came out a different times and my husbands dish had chicken and he doesn't eat meat. It was just a disaster from the start.

Very attentive and on top of the drinks. I usually order the same thing every time I go so I was very happy with my tossed green salad from their skinnylicious menu. Passion fruit iced tea is so refreshing. Avocado egg rolls were on point. Two kinds of bread given with the meals. The people in our group who ordered pasta were not impressed with their dishes though. I only tried the chipotle chicken pasta which was strangely sweet instead of spicy and I didn't like it. Fish tacos were reported to be quite good. My sister had a chicken pot pie that was actually more like chicken soup with a round crust on top. Weird. But then came the desserts. Insert the little emoji with saliva dripping from its mouth. Never fails to impress. Everyone loved their cheesecake. The two graduates got a congrats written in chocolate syrup on their plates. Very cute. So despite the pasta fails, the desserts and Jared's service with a smile bumped you up to an above average rating, cheesecake.

Now we have been to this location multiple times before but I have never reviewed it so I guess this was meant to be my 100th review for yelp. Now that's a century !!!!!! Cheesecake Factory are very similar no matter the location and the food is as always very consistent. The service is always 10 out of 10 and today was no different.  We ended up ordering fried zucchini and four cheese pasta lunch portion which is as big as the dinner portion just a couple of dollars cheaper.

Colleen R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",232,186,514,4.0,2/23/2016,"Yes, The Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but there are many reasons it is popular. The food is consistent, the menu is huge, the service is significantly above average, the portions are large, and the prices are what you'd expect. And yes, the cheesecake is good (but definitely pricey).  Complaints revolve around how crowded the restaurants are and how long the wait for a table can be.  All of the above is true for the Sawgrass Mills location. Add in a terrible parking situation, and frankly, I usually avoid eating here. That's a shame because I've eaten here twice in the past three months and had a great meal and a good experience both times.  Friday night our party of three decided to try our luck at Cheesecake Factory around 6:30 pm. Both cars found nearby parking spots right away (unheard of!) and there was no wait to be seated (on a Friday!). Lesson learned - no one is shopping at that time on a Friday and crashing at Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess was very friendly and our server came by right away when we were seated. Soon after, our drinks were served, and warm wheat and sourdough bread was placed on the table. We loved the bread.  Recommendation - two new items on the menu were really great. The blood orange mojito my sister ordered was fantastic. It had a perfect mix of sweet and sour with a zip!  And the side dish of cooked carrots with pecans that I had was unbelievable. Sooooo sweet, and crunchy and just yum.  I really enjoyed my meal of herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and the aforementioned carrots. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and came with a piccata-like lemon butter sauce. Delicious! The mashed potatoes were a pile of creamy starchy goodness. When dipped in the piccata-ish sauce, they were even better. There was plenty of everything to take home for another meal.  My family really enjoyed their chicken and shrimp meals as well, and we got cheesecake to go. I always recommend the chocolate mousse cheesecake if you're a chocolate lover like me! Overall, we had a really good meal - No wait, friendly and efficient service, and good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=40

Kimberly D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",522,362,1188,4.0,3/17/2015,"Located in the Oasis of the Sawgrass Mills Mall, this Cheesecake Factory is one of the busiest. But my friend and I had a great experience, even though there were people waiting out the door on a Friday night. We waited only 15 minutes for a first available table, which happened to be by the bar. The tables were clean and turnover looked very fast. The restaurant is very dark inside and very loud. Our server was really great; I forgot her name but she came to check up on us enough times and was very attentive to our table.  I ordered the steak medallions from the Skinnylicious menu. Even though it comes with mashed potatoes, I was able to change it to steamed broccoli to fit my diet. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium, and it was delicious! Soft and chewy (the way I prefer) and the marinade for the meat was tasty and flavorful. It was my first time ordering it and I would not hesitate to order it again. Although the portion looked smaller than usual CF dishes, I was very full at the end of my meal. Obviously you have to save room for some cheesecake when you visit the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual favorite, the Tuxedo Cream cheesecake. It has a mix of milk and white chocolate that tastes like heaven in your mouth.

Savanna M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",254,966,4960,4.0,8/2/2013,"I'm going to start by saying this is my favorite Cheesecake Factory in the area (considering Sawgrass, Aventura and Fort Lauderdale) and that's based solely on parking.  Yes parking is a mess, but it's more of a mess at Aventura and Las Olas.  As far as food and service goes, it's pretty generic, never had an experience that would swing my opinion either way. That being said, I think I finally figured out the secret to Cheesecake Factory - HAPPY HOUR!!  Happy Hour is from 4-6pm, a little short and early for my liking, but I can usually get in there and enjoy it from 5-6.   Some wines, drinks and beers are $5 - mojitos, margaritas etc.  There are also specially priced menu items at $5.  For a Cheesecake Factory these are great prices!   The corn tamale, roasted artichoke, avocado eggrolls just to name a few are excellent.

I was trying to not spend a ton of money so we went light, but the bill was still about $60 which is by no means light, but I know where I could have trimmed...   We started off with the white bean hummus as a cheap and quick little appetizer.. can't go wrong there.. Love it, and it comes out as fast as the drinks. I had a lunch size pasta, farfalle with roasted garlic and sundried tomatoes, and requested the fried chicken with it for a change.. I usually don't eat the chicken, and was thinking the fried chicken would be a good leftover for the kids later on... We also got the lunch size ""Shepard's Pie."" It's a cottage pie guys...not a Shepard's pie..get it right. Always a delicious option for lunch.. filling and full of hidden veggies... I ordered the kids some chicken fingers, but as usual they ate most of my food, and the chicken fingers went home..  Husband loves the mint green tea.  I told Jamie to skip on the ridiculously small sized glass, unless she wanted to fetch a refill almost immediately..she took heed of the warning and brought him out a big glass, to save her the steps, and him the chance of being parched.  Great experience the other day.  Jamie was a rock star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=80

Her response with an attitude, ""when we close."" Umm but when do you close?, he says. With an attitude she replied, ""11:30PM"". We were starving so we waited for a table. We got seated with menus. About 5 mins went by and the same girl walked back to where our table was with the girl who sat us at the table and pointed over to us and it looked like she was saying something about her seating us at the wrong table (there were several opened tables so it didn't look like it mattered) but I'm just glad they didn't ask us to move. 15 minutes later when we had picked out our drinks and the food we want no one ever came. I went to the girl who sat us and told her no one has asked our order. So she asks one of the other servers to take our order. She asked for our drinks and walked away. About 10 minutes later she comes back with the guys in our party's beer. Another 5 minutes later she brings us (girls) liquor drinks but still no waters. She told us they ran out of bread both white and brown, we were a little disappointed. She took our order and after 15 minutes she came out with bread saying look what I found lol I was confused where she ""found it"" but it was good so I was happy. One other strange last thing was my husband ordered the chicken potstickers and they only brought him 4 ... so 10 minutes later he got the single potsticker they forgot.

Nothing bad to say about this one or any other CCF that I've been to here and other places across the country. Good good and great staff make every experience amazing. The Food: You will always get your money's worth in food, and it's good every time. I'm simply amazed at the binge of dishes they have, which at times can seem a bit overwhelming. But whatever your selection may be, expect a well prepared and flavorful dish. The Drinks: I like sitting at the bar when by myself. The house wines are good. The mixed drinks tend to be hit or miss, but usually they're good. Only gripe is they sacrifice elbow room for more seats at the bar. Cramming more seats at the bar is a good way to send the wrong message to your customers. The Cheesecake: Does anybody actually eat the cheesecake here? You're usually too full at this point to even consider it. But I can say that they do have some great cheesecake. I prefer the strawberry cheesecake myself.

Jessie L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,103,23,3.0,11/30/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always so over-crowded. Good luck not waiting at least a half an hour. Packed with your average fat fuck Americans who need cheesecake like a hole in the head. But last night I lucked out and came here with 3 other people and were seated right away. Upon being escorted to our seating area, the 4 of us almost slipped and fell. The floors in here were so slippery that we could've moon-walked to our seats. One issue with The Slip 'N Fall Factory is that their menu is like an encyclopedia, making it nearly impossible to order in a timely fashion. They have 2 pages of just ""Specialties"", which are mainly all chicken dishes. We found ourselves using the process of elimination just to order. I think that's why the wait times here are usually ridiculous, because most peoples' time is spent on deciding on what to order. Not to mention the horses who stuff their faces with cheesecake that park themselves for an hour or 2 after they're finished to digest their food, disregarding the other patrons waiting to be seated. The food is good. I don't think that I've ever had bad food here. The caesar salad was excellent, after they finally got to us. We saw one food runner whose GPS clearly wasn't working, walk past our table several times with our caesar salads. Later in the evening, he ran spaghetti and meatballs to the party next to us and he served it over the wall next to them, causing his dirty rag that he wipes up his sweat with to fall into the food. The oblivious people ate it anyways. The main courses were very good. About mid-meal, we called for a manager to inform him of the slippery floors and the bloody murder that occurred in the ladies' room. There was blood on the sink, piss on the toilet seats, and no toilet paper. The manager arrived, and he was of Asian descent, about 21-years-old. I've never seen a Chinaman so tall. He informed us that the slippery floors were grease from the food, and he said that he'd take care of it right away. He sent out a sweeper who I saw sweep up about 4 or 5 tiles, and the slipperiness was in every square inch of the joint. On exit, the floors were even greasier than before.

People have been to ""The Cheesecake Factory"" time and time again and know what the deal is, but I love The Cheesecake Factory! So I will review it! My favorite location is in Florida, of course. Everything is always better in warmer temperatures with a little sun. Located in ""Sawgrass Mills Mall"" (Largest mall in south Florida) this Cheesecake Factory is large. What I also like is that  this particular location of the mall is all open, with no rooftop. So you can dine at the seating area outside(which I prefer) and enjoy the nice weather.  Whenever I go down there, I prefer lunch at the cheesecake factory. Their menu is ridiculously huge. I look through about 10 times just to narrow it down to atleast 3 options lol. They had this burger, which I don't see anymore, unless they changed the name, but it was a huge burger with cheese and lettuce and onions and tomato and a perfectly cooked egg right on top. And yes, it's simple enough and a lot of places serve a burger like that, but this one is done really right. Yum! I also love love love their ""Spicy Chicken Sandwich"". Crispy chicken breast covered with melted cheese(your choice) and either spicy buffalo sauce or chipotle mayo served on a brioche bun. I'd go with the mayo. It's a really big sandwich too, even I can't finish it!. I've also had their ""Kobe burger"" which fell in the category of not so great, but i'll give it another go, just to make sure.  They also have this really great lunch special with their pizza menu. It comes with an appetizer (I get caesar salad) and you choose any one of their pizzas. And guess what?! It's unlimited! Their pizza is really good too. I recommend the ""Tomato, Basil, and Cheese pizza"".  So you see, even though  the Cheesecake Factory is a chain and everyone has been there, it has some really great eats.

I specifically asked the waiter how this dish can be made with less calories as indicated on the menu, & he specifically said ""the pastry shell is extremely thin."" I had no problem with that. But what I was served instead was, literally, ONE bite-sized piece of chicken. I had to complain, and the apologetic waiter brought some more chicken. Unfortunately, we didn't see much of our waiter, and had to flag down someone else for drink refills. I can only assume that this location's mediocre rating (I would give 2.5 stars if possible) is due to its captive audience of many thousands of shoppers (most of them tourists) at the Sawgrass Mills outlets.

Alyssa K.,"Fort Myers, FL",383,471,35,4.0,8/4/2014,This review is based only on my experience with takeout at the counter the other day. I have been to this restaurant for dine in before; and while you will get good service and food-you will wait dearly for it: this is a primo location. The take out was pretty fast. The guy was flirting but wouldn't give me the half off cheesecake day discount (I was a day late!) so no go. Sorry ;) That being said it was easy to get what I needed and walked out of a packed house with 4 slices and a hungry car waiting. The menu here is enormous but that's every CF. I will go to CF for dine in: but not on a weekend night and likely not at Sawgrass. The place alone (and parking!) gives me anxiety.

This particular location is extra horrible due to all the tourists wheeling around luggages from shopping. Food is disaster. Never understood why people prefer 300 fish options and food from 50+diff countries --of seriously crap quality food most likely 75% menu is FROZEN vs a simple easy menu selection.

First I ordered an iced coffee. I think they just poured hot coffee over ice because it was very watered down and had no taste. As I'm drinking it my sister pointed out that there was a bug in it. Gross. I exchanged it for a hot coffee instead.  Then our food took an hour to come out. I finally got my omelette and took the first bite. I immediately knew something was wrong with it and I looked Inside and the bacon was so burnt it was black. They remade it but by the time they brought me a new one everyone in my party was done eating and I had lost my appetite.  We asked for boxes for the leftovers and a different waiter came and only had small boxes. When we asked for larger ones he said they didn't have any.

The appetizer salad, which I ordered as an entree is enough for two people, but was drenched in dressing. The avocado club sandwich was very good.

Creamy, and oh! so so tasty :)  I've had a few of their burgers, but yesterday I tried the Macaroni and Cheese burger. It was ok... it does not taste like much. I think they could definitely make the ball of mac n' cheese a little more spiced up, and top everything off with a special sauce, or something. The fries are amazing, though! My mom had the bang bang chicken and shrimp and loved it. I've had some chicken chipotle pasta in the past (can't remember the name) and it was so awesome that I usually take that. The portions are so huge that I have to take the rest home and it's enough to fulfill my hunger at lunch the next day. And let's be honest, pasta is always best when reheated the next day.

My family loves this place and I HATE it for one reason lousy, lousy, LOUSY service. I understand we have a large party food will take awhile but why did it take over 20 minutes just to take our drink order? Our waiters attitude was great he was very nice, just slow with service and forgetful of what we were requesting. The food is never a problem for me and although they did not have what i ordered this night (lemon herb chicken) it was replaced quite well by the Teriyaki Chicken. Appetizers, breads, and deserts are 9/10 times good. If the service was not so horrible I would love this place but even a party of 4 takes 2 hours to get in and out. Why? I'll never know most meals are very pricey anyway so there really should be no delay on the waiters part of how much he/she well get tipped. I usually just tip 20%, more or less if warranted by my standards. Thanks for the time fellow Yelpers, I hope you all have a much greater experience then I, here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=180

A very wide variaty menu, where you can find anything you're craving, one dish can be shared between at least two people, at a very fair price (you can say cheap) and you can't miss a cheesecake for dessert. My advise, share an appetizer, a main dish and dessert between 3 peoples, it will be enough food and you wont spend more than $10 per person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=180
Tom L.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,32,19,2.0,3/22/2011,"We go here quite a lot when I am over in the Plantation/Sunrise area.  It's relatively convenient and the family likes the mall. Now let me start by saying I always order the same thing.  Everytime-no matter what CCF I go to and I have never been disappointed.  I order the little lunch special with the spring salad, chicken salad, and soup of the day.  it's cheap, good, and hard to screw up and none of them ever have. That being said my family are more adventurous with their food and they like to try different things.  Silly them when it comes to places like this. As noted by prior reviewers- loud, crowded, and slow with a long wait time just about anytime of the day.  Sometimes you are seated on top of the neighbors in those stupid little tables that I can't stand and you end up not talking to your spouse the entire time because either you don't want to talk about personal stuff within earshot of others or you are too busy listening to other talking about personal stuff. On this last trip our wait was only five minutes or so.  Then we were seated in a nice booth.  Shortly thereafter Jabba the Hut, our waitress arrived.  To say she was nasty would be an insult to nasty people.  She was downright rude and it seems we were far below her station in life and were interfering with her personal time.  I put an end to this quickly and had the manager changes waiters for us.  That put things back on an even keel. So we ordered and the food was served to the four of us at four different times since it seems the kitchen couldn't coordinate a four tops meal.  My wife's picata was OK but it was a cream sauce and was too salty.  My daughters alfredo was ok but it tasted like a jarred sauce.  Once again my old favorite was fantastic. I guess it comes down to this.  At least for the Cheesecake Factory find something they can't screw up and keep ordering that.  Stray from the path too far and you are going to be sorry. Will i go back again.  Sure, at least for my little lunch special.  I'll just be sure to carry enough garlic to scare the ogre wait staff away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=180

The way to describe the service is ""stressed"", you can tell those poor servers were just going nuts with all the people they had to serve.  You could tell they all were doing their best to keep up.   Because of the incredible amount of foot traffic, they had to stand between the tables that were about 2 feet from each other.  ""What does this mean exactly?"" You may be wondering.  Well, that when they were talking to the other two tables on each side I had a very personal relationship with the servers butt.  That was just something I wasn't too keen on, not being a canine, it wasn't something I wanted at nose level. The food was abundant and very good so I have no complaints on that part.  I had the Grilled Veggie Pizza with Goat Cheese.  It was good eats.   The tea was as always DELICIOUS!

Every time I come to this place to eat, there's a line and a wait. The food is okay, but is it worth the crowded tables? Or the fact you have to yell at your neighboring diner to have a conversation. Not to mention the mind boggling book for a menu? I'm one that prefers to have a restaurant with one or two specialty cuisines. Cheesecake apparently has everything under the sun and it gets confusing. You have to go there and make sure you have a preference or your brain will be playing ping pong with which dish you should order. Everything I've had here is just plain okay. Nothing extravagant or to die for. I have a few people that love the huge burrito, and my father was extremely impressed with a lunch miso salmon. Me....I don't even remember exactly what I've eaten here other than a simple salad dish, and a chicken dish that was unremarkable. The free bread is scrumptious though, so I guess I could just go there for the bread and some cheesecake. I think the only thing worth getting here would of course be their cheesecakes.

It is served with chopped apples, beets, asparagus, edamame, tomatoes, cucumbers and some white cheddar cubes. They bring it with a pomegranate glaze and a balsamic vinaigrette.  I skipped the glaze and just used some of the dressing.  It is very tasty just by itself.  My boyfriend had the lunch salmon portion, which was fairly big.  They serve you a 7oz piece of salmon, almost anyway you want it.  He opted for the grilled version, served with 2 veggies (some veggies are $1 more) ($13.95)  Robert our server was very attentive, polite and patient with us.

After about 15 mins they were able to sit us at a booth which is what we prefer so that was good.  The food was good however my fish tacos could of been a little bit less soggy and contain  more fish it seemed like there was almost no fish in the tacos. They did have a nice spicy kick to them which was told to me by the waitress which was fine since I like spicy foods. My wife had the Shepards pie which she said was good and we ordered chicken tenders for our son who only ate a couple of pieces as he was in one of his I don't feel like eating modes so I'm sure they were fine as our son will Sometimes eat and sometimes won't.  We ordered cheesecake to go as you can't go there without getting their cheesecake.  The waitress was extremely slow and not very attentive she also failed to ask for my I.d. as it states to do so on the back of my card.

Not bad and is what we were told, however, we were not seated in the booth we requested so we were told 15 more minutes.  While waiting I went ahead and ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go for later.  The gentleman ran me up and closed out my order and I waited for my two deserts.  After fifteen minutes I asked him where were my deserts?  Incredibly he forgot to get our order and we had to wait again.  NP  Our table was still not available anyway and we spoke with manager Antonio who was very nice and apologetic about our experience thus far and personally ensured we got the appropriate booth within five minutes.  After being sat my wife and I both ordered the shrimp scampi as we do two to three times each month here.  The scampi is usually awesome and to die for (were addicted to the sauce).  On the visit tonight it continued to go down hill when, after 25 minutes, we were served cold shrimp and pasta so over cooked it was one big clump of rubber.  At this point we were ready to go and chaulk it up as just a bad night.  Evidently our server Cydney, who was very nice as well, let the manger know about our scampi and desire to leave.  The manager, Sandy, came by our table and asked what was wrong.  I told her the shrimp was cold and I also proceeded to show here how the block of pasta was overcooked she snapped ""I can see you don't need to show me"".  It was evident in her tone the she did not want to be there..... Seems she was having just as bad a night.  Sandy asked if we wanted our scampi replaced (over an hour now) we declined noting she really didn't want to be bothered.   On our way out we ran into manger Antonio again who inquired about our visit and we told him the mishaps.   I mentioned to him that after not even getting to eat I thought it was in bad taste that manager Sandy charged my wife for her glass of wine she never finished after such a bad experience.  Antonio agreed and asked us to please stay for a minute because it was his duty to make sure we leave happy and was going to be right back with us.   This is where they lost two good regular guests.  After five minutes Antonio returned and stated ""I am so embarrassed to tell you that Sandy took our meals off our check but insists on charging for the wine (even though it wasn't drunken) and she is senior to his position and there is nothing he can do"".  After getting crap service, crap food, and an attitude from Sandy on top my wife and I just looked at each other and we left for good.  As long as Sandy is employed at The Cheesecake Factory this restaurant is on our ""STAY AWAY"" list.  Fortunately they have a sister company next door Grand Lux Café (run very well) that just got some more regular customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=200
Rusty S.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,37,,4.0,11/8/2010,"As others have said, you'll always get a good meal at this Cheesecake Factory location.  It's not five-star food, but it's always satisfying.  The fact that the kitchen can always churn out good food with such a large menu has always amazed me. As with all Cheesecake Factory locations, the portions are enormous.  The appetizer salads are the size of an entree salad at any other restaurant.  A bowl of soup is literally a bowl... about two bowls at any other restaurant or four cups.  My wife and I gave up on trying to order an appetizer soup/salad for each of us because we were full by the time our entrees arrived. We've since resorted to ordering one appetizer to share.  Our favorite is the Avocado Eggrolls.  If they come out soggy, send them back because when they are crisp, they are one of the most delicious things on the menu. If you've never tried the Pumpkin or Pumpkin-Pecan cheesecakes, get out there before they go off of the seasonal menu.  They are fabulous.  The pumpkin goes down sweet but you get the full pumpkin aroma in the back of your nose and throat just as you swallow.  I never liked pumpkin anything before, but these two desserts are great. My biggest complaint with this location is the table layout.  In the center of the interior dining room are two long benches with alternating two-tops and four-tops.  If we are unfortunate enough to get seated at one of the two-tops, it can totally ruin the dining experience as the adjacent four-tops are only one foot away.  If you get two families with children on either side of you, be prepared for a less-than-enjoyable evening.  My recommendation to the management would be to put all the four-tops and two-tops together as much as possible.  At least couples would then be seated together and be able to enjoy their meal without their conversation being drowned out by larger parties.  Worst case, tell the hostess you're willing to wait for one of the few two-person booths.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=200

I've tried a few items, but of course the cheesecake is really good. The dulce de leche, Godiva chocolate, banana creme, pumpkin (seasonal), and mocha are the flavors I've tried and all were delicious.

Although the menu is overwhelming (put in the form of a small book!), there is something that will suit everyone's taste at this establishment.     Last night my friend and I started with an order of the chicken samosas, which were very crisp and stuffed with well seasoned chicken. They were accompanied by a creamy cilantro dipping sauce, not too spicy but not too bland, very tasty. I also ordered the factory burrito, which was the size of my head! This thing was enormous!

My boyfriend and I used to live about 5 mins away and we came in at least twice a month minimum to order some drinks and some cheesecake in the least! We have also never had any problems with the staff there, we always have a good experience with the servers/bartenders and the wait has been crazy sometimes but they are really good about quoting a proper amount of time. I am in love with their snickers cheesecake and their passion fruit mojito. It is a sweet combination and it can get overwhelming but it is my only way. The snickers cheesecake has a dark chocolate base and then the delicious cheesecake with some caramel and chocolate on top and let me say that it is the most amazing cheesecake you will ever have! The mojito itself is a basic mojito but with an added passion fruit flavor and it is just refreshing and delicious.  I have had a long range of their meals and I don't think there's enough characters here to mention but the Louisiana chicken pasta is worth the time. The chicken is inside a thin crispy parmesan crust and then the pasta is tossed in a New Orleans creamy sauce and it is just amazing.

Charlotte W.,"Toronto, Canada",109,473,60,2.0,9/28/2012,"I am not a really huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but as I was with my Canadian friends, they really wanted to try this place out (as they heard so much about it). I never order from their regular menu as I just can't imagine scarfing down a minimum of 2500 calories in one go. If anyone has ever heard of the book, Eat This, Not That, Cheesecake Factory dishes are often on the Do Not Eat That category...and for good reason too. One of my friends ordered the Chicken Little which basically was a plate of not-so-little deep fried chicken pieces. As he ate, the pieces actually seemed to multiply (that's how big the plate was). My bf ordered the Monster Burrito which comes on a lobster-sized platter. The waitress describes the burrito as big as a wrestlers arm, and she wasn't kidding - filled with rice, beans, guacamole, cheese and sour cream, this will be enough to feed an entire family. At Cheesecake, I always order from the lighter fare menu which lists out caloric content. I had a salad, but my salad came with a heap of rice?!?  My friends ended off with a HUGE slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was delish, but nothing special. All in all, if you want a mega-caloric-artery-clogging experience, come to the Cheesecake.

My wife's entree was significantly smaller than before with much less pasta than the times she had ordered it before.  My burger didn't taste great and I actually had trouble finishing it.  However, the most disappointing aspect of my meal was the fries.  They used to serve the shoestring fries and they would give you a huge amount of them.  They now not only give you less fries, but they changed the fries to a much thicker version and not as tasty.   We did have to wait approx. 15 minutes to get seated.  Out waitress was very good and she refilled drinks promptly and the food was served in a timely manner.   Overall, this location just isn't up to par with the other locations I have eaten at and I wouldn't go back here.  There are plenty of other Cheesecake Factories in this area so I don't need to go back here.  And I hope that they go back to their old style of fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=220

I was a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory back in the day when it introduced itself to the South Florida dining scene back n the 90s. Now, and for a very longtime, I'm not really enthused about dining here. Apart from a very extensive menu that confuses the heck outta me, over time it become unattractive. So, I had a hankering for Ribs and since I was watching my carb intake, I scrapped the mashed potatoes and subbed for Asparagus. Ok, the beef ribs came room temp to the table, the BBQ sauce was good and the amount of asparagus served on the dish was meesly, a mere 6 stalks, after spending already $27 on the ribs and add another $7 to sub for the asparagus, come on Cheesecake, you can do better! Really, thoroughly disappointed, AGAIN!! I only went because my friend had a celebration dinner and I tagged along. The only pleasant surprise for the evening was our server that was efficient, organized and a pleasingly witty personality. Plus, the Coconut Chocolate cheesecake was really good and reminded me of an Almond Joy candy!

Katie H.,"Larkspur, CA",74,603,28,2.0,4/14/2008,"I don't actually hate the Cheesecake Factory. Depsite the often hellish waits, grotesque portions and mediocre service, when I have eaten at other locations, I haven't minded so much, given that I can get 2-3 meals out of one moderately priced entree, and the food is actually pretty tasty.  This was not the case when my sister hosted a post-baptism brunch here on Sunday. She arranged for a private room for our group of 17 and asked to have a table for the 6 kids and a table for 11 adults. The table was set in somewhat of a U sahpe, if the U had very short arms. It was impossible to see, let alone talk to, half of the people in our party.  We were given one server for our party, and she apparantly did not believe in using a tray, meaning it took her about 4 trips to get everyone their beverages. We were given a limited menu to choose from - ceaser salad and pesto pizza for me and a burger for my husband. The ceaser was so bland. My memory of the CF ceaser was that the dressing was creamy and garlicy. This was basically just oil. The pizza was just okay. My husband's burger was good, but overcooked (medium well when he asked for medium rare). The serving of the food was a complete cluster-F. My sister ordered a large pizza for the kids as soon as we sat down and asked that it be brought asap. It came 20 minutes later. Another 10 minutes later, the rest of the food started coming out - again without a tray jack and 2 dishes at a time. It was almost 15 minutes between the time the first person was served and the last.  By this time, my sister was fuming and asked to see a manager. She also asked that the cheesecake she had arranged for be brought out immediately as we had already been there almost 2 hours. At this point she was informed they didn't have a record of her ordering one!  Eventually they got one out, and didn't charge us for it.

My mother and I came here for an after-church brunch a la my treat.  We ordered the crab hash ($12.95) and a lunch portion of the Luau salad ($8.95).  The luau salad was presented very nicely with shredded carrots, mango, romaine lettuce, nuts, and shredded sliced(?!?!) chicken.  The chicken was more reminiscent of lunch meat chicken, but the vegetables were fresh and tasty.  The dressing was nice but somewhat overdressed for my tastes.  The fried wonton skin was nice and crispy but soon became soggy.  Overall, the salad was okay, and it was big enough to split between the two of us. So what happened?  The crab hash was a disaster.  Couldn't be salvaged.  I had ONE tiny piece of crab, the eggs were poached poorly and looked messy, the potatoes were overcooked and oversalted. And surprisingly, the presentation was awful and looked worse than a fast-food diner.   It could have used some fresh herbs!  For $12.95, this was worth maybe $3 to me.  Extremely disappointing!

Joanne W.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,18,,4.0,9/8/2008,"I like the cheesecake factory, not because of the cheesecake (frankly I think I make them better and I have to watch the waistline) but because I know what to get.  I don't mind the wait, because it is one of the busiest malls in the country and it is a cheescake factory.  I don't mind all the dissonance of noise, because I expect it from every large chain restaurant.    I don't mind the fair service, that is neither good nor bad, because every table is filled.  My husband ordered the baby back ribs here and it was remarkably good.  I had the Asian Salad and it was filling and the dressing was above average.  I took a bite of the cheesecake my husband ordered (a chocolate raspberry??) and while it was a little dry it was better than most restaurant brought cheescakes.  Don't come here for great service, out of this world food, and short waits.  Come because you want a filling meal while shoving through the mall on a shopping spree funding from credit card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sunrise?start=240
