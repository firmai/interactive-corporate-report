46,Julie E.,"Boise, ID",195,326,264.0,3.0,2014-07-26,"My husband and me have been staying away from Red Robin a bit since our last experience (at the Parkcenter location in Boise) was less than stellar.  We feel that changes Red Robin has made to 'keep up' with the more upscale burger joints (Five Guys/Smash Burger etc) took away from some of what made them our favorite sit down burger place.  My husband had a free birthday burger available to him though, so we took a chance at the Eagle Road location.   Since we were only the second customers through the door of the day, being greeted and seated was no problem.  We were seated in a booth just behind the passway aisle between the bar and the main restaurant.  In retrospect this was kind of annoying.. HOWEVER we failed to speak up when the hostess asked if the spot was okay, so the onus was on US.  Gone are the table tents that used to tout the current 'special' burger (right now some ginormous thing with brisket on it to go with the new ""Hercules"" movie) Gone are the large glossy tri-fold plastic menus (replaced by smaller, spiral bound booklets).  Also gone are the funky little cardboard coasters for your beverage.  STILL there however, an assortment of intriguing appetizers, beverages, burgers, sandwiches, salads, entrees and desserts.  As others have mentioned, the prices have indeed gone up.  You have to be very careful when looking at the burgers if you are having to watch your pennies.. I wound up with an 'artisan' burger (the black and bleu,.. noms) that was $14 compared to others as low as $7.99.  As we reviewed the menu I saw the hostess coming our way with a family of four.  Parents and two little ones probably no older than 2 and 4.  Despite the entire restaurant being open season, they were seated directly behind us.   I promise, I understand that servers have their set 'areas' and that keeping patrons in the areas with assigned servers is status quo, but I still fail to see why at least ONE booth couldn't have been left as a buffer.   To their credit however, the parents did a wonderful job of keeping the noise level down, there were no kicks to the back of our booth and no little hands sought to try advanced knot tying with my hair (which HAS happened to me in other places).   Hubby chose the crispy chicken sandwich, asking it be placed in a basket (they've done away with the red plastic baskets in favor of what we think are some horrific plates) that his sandwich be wrapped (they don't do that anymore either unless you ask) and cut in half.  He also asked for ranch to dip his fries in.  I ordered the  Black and Bleu burger and fries. (On Ciabatta bread served open face, the burger is topped with sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions and crumbled bleu cheese, a 'knife and forker' delight!).   He was drinking the tropical green tea (a bit to sweet for my taste) I went with  diet Dr. Pepper.   Our order arrived, prepared exactly as we asked it to be.  The food was hot and tasty.  Our server was a bit slow on drink refills (again odd, as there were very few people in the restaurant).  When the manager came around to see how we were doing his arms were laden with notebooks and a box of Krispy Kreme donuts, which I thought was not only unprofessional but left us feeling like we'd interrupted his day).   We lingered a bit over beverage refills and a 2nd order of fries then left.  Oh and apparently they've done away with the free birthday dessert.  But at almost 50 my husband and me are okay with that.  Suffice it to say this was a much better Red Robin experience than our last forray in Boise.  We'll likely go back to this location again, for MY birthday in October.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=40,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

I guess they were low on staff.  However, when we got seated, manager came to apologize for the wait, and our server was 100% perfect in all categories!  Lilya was Ukrainian, with a slight accent, and an ideal demeanor for the job she has.

35,Phillip D.,"Meridian, ID",40,83,,4.0,2014-09-24,"Right off the bat I will say that I am a fan. In case you didnt gather this from the star rating I gave them. Guess what I have when I go to red Robin? yeah, you guessed it, a burger. Well, I did have the Fish and Chips a couple times. So I will review some of the various things that I have had here. I did like the fish and chips here with an exception. The exception is grease. They seem to be very hit and miss with this. Sometimes you can get their fish and chips and the grease is minimal. Sometimes you will get their fish and chips and can barely see the fish for the grease. Ok, so maybe that is a bit of an over exaggeration, but sometimes you have to do these things to make a point. The point being that there was just way too much grease. What I hate the most if when I complain to the server. Often what I get is; ""Its fried. Grease is what happens when you fry things."" I even heard this from a manger once. A bit off the subject, but I hate these sorts of comments. I was in a BBQ joint once and the Brisket was very fatty. I asked the server if there was any leaner and she replied; ""That is the way brisket is. Its always fatty."" I almost came out of my seat! Needless to say, I have no been back there since.  Back on track. I dont get thier Fish and Chips anymore. Its just too risky for me. I have had most of their burgers. These are often hit and miss as well, but this is pretty common when you are hiring cooks and not paying them much. My norm is the chili cheeseburger. In fact, the last couple times I was here, I had the Banzi Burger and had them turn this into a chili burger. Even better is if you replace the mayo with mustard. I know it sounds weird, but there is just something about the acid in the mustard which really plays well to Chili. I love their chili here. It peppery and very flavorful. The only thing I wish they had was a version of the chili without beans. My main advice here it to not look down. On more than 1 occasion, I dropped a crayon (My daughter is 10 and we often play Football with crayons on the table) under the table. When I looked under the table to get it, I was disgusted There was food and trash all under the table. So when you go Red Robin, enjoy the food, but dont look down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=20,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998
52,TheStranger 2.,"Meridian, ID",1,76,8.0,1.0,2014-09-27,"This location in Meridian, is the perfect example of how one franchise can be so bad and one so good.  This location is BAD.   We arrived for late lunch on a Saturday and seated promptly. They were busy, but not to capacity.  It was about six minutes until our server arrived.  She was pleasant and took our drink order then disappeared.  We sat and sat.  She brought no water nor utensils.  We sat and sat.  She brought our drinks, took our order then disappeared again.  Still no water or utensils.  I finally flagged her down and asked for water and utensils which she brought finally.  The Food: Terrible.  I ordered the Big Red Tavern burger.  For $8.79 one would think it would be something better than ordinary.  It wasn't.  Comparable  to a ""fast food"" burger for  $3.99. My GF ordered the catfish with steamed veggies.  Her portions were tiny and they gave her french-fries instead of veggies.  We brought this to the attention of our occasional server.  She was clueless about the meal, but brought the veggies, which were barely warm.  My burger was so small that I kept requesting the ""bottomless steak fries"" and took bites only intermittently.  The Food: Inconstant and mediocre.    The Service: Slow and slower.  The exact opposite of our experience at the Milwaukee location.  We won't ever return to the Meridian Red Robin for any reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=40,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

I'll always keep coming back. Unfortunately, this was not the best of times.  My group and I showed up right at opening for an early lunch and were the first people in. We sat and ordered quick enough and our server Jannel was very sweet. Really, the only problem was that we only got one order of fries. We chose to RR for a mass French fry intake, and in that regard we were let down. Big guys at the table who all ordered entrees were made to split single baskets of fries. Out second basket came after our check had been paid. Not what we had in mind when we we thought of a satisfying meal.   The burgers were delicious as always, the environment was great and the staff was friendly.

Food is pretty predictable with a decent selection and variety.  You can get beef burgers,  veg I burgers, chicken sandwich or salads.  The drinks,  non-alcoholic ones, are bottomless as are the fries.  You can get ranch or fry sauce to help all the fries go down easier. They have a full bar and a decent selection of beer on tap. Red Robin had always been a favorite place for me and my son loves it too.

50,Bill M.,"Meridian, ID",2,56,,2.0,2015-05-17,"My family eats at Red Robin at least once or twice a month.  So I feel confident in saying that we have seen this particular location slide a bit in the quality of service, quality of food and accuracy of our orders.  It continues to be on a downward trend.  The last couple times have been particularly challenging.  If you stay with me, I'll tell you about two specifics examples.  The first one has to do when we order shakes.  When we dine at Red Robin, we always order shakes.  My wife and I each get a monster shake and then ask to split them so we can share with our kids.  In the past, they would bring us the shakes in two adult and two smaller/kid sized glasses, looking pretty, with straws, spoons and extra napkins.  The past few times we have ordered shakes, we usually get a glass and the extra in the metal tin; and are missing either spoons, straws, or both and always have to ask for extra napkins.  Maybe I'm spoiled or my expectations are unrealistic, I think shakes should always come with a straw and a spoon; when children are involved, you should always bring extra napkins; and when sharing is involved, you always present the shared shakes as you would present the normal shakes, and reserve just dropping the metal tin of extra shake for the individual orders.  My second example, and the last time we ate at Red Robin was a to-go order, which we like to do from time to time, since the restaurant can be so crowded and busy.  I called the restaurant's phone number to order and they now have an automated answering system.  I selected the appropriate choice to place a to-go order.  The phone then rang and rang and rang and rang, for approximately 2-3 minutes; so long that it rang back, or I was sent back, to the original automated message.  So, I again selected the option to place a to-go order.  After a few rings, someone appeared to answer and put me directly on hold, as I began to hear nothing other than music and no one ever introduced themselves to me or asked me to be placed on hold.  I find this incredibly rude and one of the worst things to do to a customer calling in.  I played along, and sat on hold for more than 10 minutes; I looked at the timer on my phone before hanging up.  I decided to call back.  This time I selected the choice in the automated system to speak to a person.  (Sorry if I butcher the spelling of names from here on in my story)  Elaina answered the phone.  I tried to tell her my story.  When she heard me say 'to-go' she immediately cut me off, talked over me, didn't let me finish, and said she would be transferring me to the bar.  Being talked over and transferred off before finishing my statement is another of my major pet peeves, as a customer.  It shows a basic lack of respect and tells me I'm not important, just a disruption to your day.  When I was transferred to the bar, I was put back on hold.  I held for another 3 minutes.  As I was contemplating hanging up and driving to the restaurant to place my order, and share my grievances to someone in person, Melissa answered.  I finally got to give my order.  In all fairness, I did call at around 18:10; so I'm sure they were busy.  I don't think busy excuses basic common courtesy.  When my wife returned home from picking up our order, it was wrong.  The quality of food was okay, not what I would expect, with barely cooked fries and a burger that wasn't cooked well done; though wasn't pink, which is the choice you get, pink or no pink.  Unfortunately, having our orders wrong has become a habit; we now expect it.  Luckily, it wasn't anything we couldn't just pick off or do without.  When this particular location first opened, it was shaky.  Then they seemed to improve and we loved dining there.  Now it is becoming a place we don't enjoy going.  We have been having issues with Red Robin locations is other places, cities, states.  We have been told it is because of corporate changes.  I can't tell you what can be attributed to changes; and what is just a basic lack of customer service and pride in your work.  All I know is that with each dining experience, we are thinking more and more that Red Robin is not a place we want to frequent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=40,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

14,Lino R.,"Kuna, ID",190,189,864.0,3.0,2016-04-18,"There are just some restaurants that I struggle to write a review and this is one of them.  I think I am coming to understand that the restaurants I keep coming back to but have a hard time reviewing is because of inconsistency.  Red Robin is just that.  I have had some really good meals here and there have been times where I leave and say, I would be ok not coming back for a while.  Red Robin has gone through some changes recently when it comes to the decor and feel inside this place. Unlimited fries if you order a menu item with fries.  Their campfire sauce is really good and when the fries are hot, they taste great.  I've been here too many times were the fries are either great or stale and cold.  I know from others including myself that feel like the waiters and waitresses get annoyed when you ask for more fries.  I don't know what it is but I have felt that from many employees here over the years. Burgers are ok, sometimes it comes out hot, other times luke warm.  Keep in mind, that is my soap box, I like food hot and drinks cold so take my comments with a grain of salt. If I had a major complaint which isn't a bad thing for Red Robin is the place is usually packed and super loud.  Don't come here if you want to have a conversation with your table.  With their recent remodel, it seems to be more packed, less elbow room and a lot noisier.  Overall, just an average place for me and good place to come if unlimited fries sound good. P.S. Ask for garlic parmesian fries.  They are really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.1239999999999997,2.6

22,Mike M.,"Meridian, ID",2,40,,2.0,2016-05-06,"This is a chain restaurant and it's pretty obvious. The food lacks character and there are all sorts of weird promotions and gimmicks. The tables have a tablet thing that you can use to pay, order drinks, flag your server, etc. If I wanted to order from a machine, I'd get my meals from a vending machine. It's not that this location in particular is unsatisfactory, rather, that appears to be the trend I've seen the last couple times I was at Red Robin.  As I said previously, the food lacks character. I got what was billed as a spicy burger. It was not. It was a thin meat patty with some incredibly salty 'fried jalapeño medallions', their 'ghost pepper sauce' (which is glorified ketchup), and some lettuce, tomato, etc. The fries were okay, but you should really order them well-done or else they'll come out wobbly and mealy.  My girlfriend got some chicken tenders which tasted as though they'd been fried in really old oil. They had a weird bitterness to them that was pretty well masked with the dipping sauce. The best part of the meal was the onion rings. Those were pretty darn good.  The service was okay, but our server seemed more interested in getting us to use the tablet thing than actually taking our orders. To be honest, I got the feeling that this is a chain restaurant desperately trying to stay afloat but really just grasping at straws.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-meridian?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.152,2.52

Milkshakes my kids (and significant other) LOVE, their salads are huge and yummy, and their BLTA Croissant is a perfect pick for a lunchtime meal. Great for groups, great for kids as it's loud in general in there and cleanup of spills/mess is easy due to their stained concrete floors and smooth table tops. Always a great ""Go-To"" as they have something for everyone.

After we ate, our server was MIA so I  told another server and still nothing happened. A while later, our server came out and sang to a table near us (someone else's birthday), but it still didn't jog his memory that there was a little boy waiting for his moment at our table. Then we received our bill. So I went to find a manager who eventually brought out half-melted ice cream and the staff FINALLY sang to my son. We never got an apology or explanation from our server. The whole ordeal took way too long and I was shocked at the poor customer service. We definitely won't spend another birthday meal here.

When my server finally arrived she apologized and told me that she had a bigger table that she was dealing with which is fine, I know you're busy. My is that the restaurant was 95% empty and it took so long to even be acknowledged.  She was pleasant, took my order and left. Sometime later she brought my salad and left. I saw her about 15 minutes later with my burger and she didn't ask me if I wanted another salad or anything. My drink tasted foul and I would have liked the opportunity to let her know  so that I can have water that was drinkable. She just dropped the food and left.  Never saw her again until it was time to pay. She never asked me if my food was okay, never asked me if I would like another dinner salad. Nothing. Nada. There were less than a dozen customers in the entire restaurant and bar. How is it that you can have at least 6 or more staff members out front and no one even bothered to look my way for so long.

Now that, that, is out of the way lets begin the review... It is Friday evening in ""downtown"" Boise and the night life is a bumpin. As I approach the parking lot I notice there are only two cars parked. ""Are they remodeling the Robin?"" I thought to myself, as it is very odd for such a fine establishment to be packed to the entrance. Normally I would have made reservations, however this was a last minute decision. As I enter, there is a young man blowing up balloons. Normally I would say ""yeah blow all the balloons you can"" however he was filling an empty room with balloons. When there are more balloons than patrons... you have a problem. I stand there waiting for him to get up when a young lady appears and ask if we have been helped. I replied ""No, I've been watching this kid blow more balloons than a clown on tour"" so it was at this moment I was finally seated. Instead of a human helping me I had this robot etch a sketch thing take my order. I own a Razr flip phone so I am out of touch with all these fancy gadgets. I finally figure out the hieroglyphics key code in order to request an order. My burger was good. They skimped super tough on the fries which confused me since the entire place was basically empty. When I order unlimited fries I never want to see the bottom of the basket. I stared deeply into the checkered lining paper for 10 minutes before a refill was brought to me.
