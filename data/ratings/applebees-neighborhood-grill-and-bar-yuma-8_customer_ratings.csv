23,Taija B.,"Yuma, AZ",18,17,1.0,3.0,2012-02-22,I've been here at least five times and I'm always seated in the same seat every single time... The service is terrible during the day and improves with they're A team at night. I just ordered takeout yesterday and I ordered nachos. The gave me tons of boxes of the ingredients for nachos for me to construct the dish myself and forgot my drink! At first I was angry but I had Fun building it so that's a plus. Plus the girl tiffany was super nice so no bones about that ;),https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8?start=20,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997
17,Christopher B.,"Miami Beach, FL",294,571,606.0,3.0,2012-07-06,"Went here with a large party and two of the dishes came out over 5 minutes after the others.  The manager admitted that the cooks ""left them off the list"" but managed to recover by comping them without being asked.   Other than that, this Applebee's is not really any different than the others.  The food per the price is not necessarily tasty or well-proportioned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
22,Jamie S.,"Oceanside, CA",27,10,1.0,1.0,2013-08-17,"I've never walked out of a restaurant due to lack of service before. Firstly I waited about 5 minutes when waiting to be greeted and offered a table. I was looked over and the people who walked in behind me were seated first. Then I waited what seemed to be an additional 5 to 10 minutes when the guy came back told me it would be a minute before someone could get me seated... looked at me again and brought me to a table. I requested a booster seat but instead my daughter and I waited 15 minutes at our table with no greeting from any of the wait staff, no drinks and not even the booster seat that was requested. I'm very disappointed  in the Applebee's Yuma locations. I will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8?start=20,,,,,
21,TeeWhy M.,"San Diego, CA",1,40,5.0,1.0,2013-10-06,We almost walked out in the first place for waiting too long for our food. Then the food comes. No apologized. Rude staff. Fat ass manager greeted everyone else but our table(maybe because we're not Mexican). Worst dining experience. Never coming back!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8?start=20,,,,,
20,Latrice B.,"Pasadena, MD",23,22,16.0,4.0,2014-03-03,I have been there a few times and every time its very pleasant.  The employees are very friendly and attentive to your needs. My food was fresh and hot when it came out. This is my favorite applebees in Yuma!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8?start=20,,,,,
16,Kay V.,"San Diego, CA",2,77,1.0,1.0,2014-04-13,"We walked out before our food came after waiting 20minutes. Everyone around us had either dirty dishes at their table or were waiting for food. Absolutely obnoxious environment , very loud music, six different TV shows on so if you and your eating partner are on opposite sides of the table you are watching completely different things. Way to have a dining experience, Applebys. This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
19,Sandra B.,"Independence, KY",26,33,2.0,1.0,2014-05-02,"Waited to be seated for a long time. Acted as if we were intruding on their time. Ordered and after waiting 20 minutes without even salad delivered, we informed the waiter we were leaving. Women came in with a chihuahua and sat next to us. Don't go you'll kick yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
12,Ana G.,"New York, NY",328,67,131.0,4.0,2014-05-27,"I have been coming to this location for years. On this occasion I came is with my family, there was a total of 5 people. We were seated quickly by the manager who greeted us and let us know the name of the server that would be helping us. The server was very polite and courteous. I was pleased with the options and attentiveness of the staff. The food was good, they had something for everyone.  Tip: half off appetizers and drinks during happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
14,Jay S.,"Milwaukee, WI",247,561,1236.0,3.0,2014-06-07,The food was the same as you would expect at any Applebee's anywhere in the country. It was pretty good. The service from Jackie was fantastic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
24,Ray R.,"Yuma, AZ",0,15,,2.0,2014-07-12,"Food was ok, it was what one would expect from an Applebee's.  The service however, lacked something to be desired.  One goes to an Applebee's because you know what your getting no matter where in the country you are, this visit was disappionting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8?start=20,,,,,
18,Neil D.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,10,,4.0,2014-09-10,Happy hour here is a great deal. Food was great and had healthy choices to choose from. In and out with a full restaurant in less than 30 min.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
15,Kristine L.,"Yuma, AZ",18,3,4.0,1.0,2015-01-08,My steak had plastic in it and I ate it. I pulled out what was left from my mouth. I showed and reported it to the supervisor on shift/ Francis; she just told me she let the cook know to becareful. I had to wait to request another plate from the waiter while she talked to her friends at a table for 25 min. I waited a long time for another plate then they wanted me to charge me for both. I come her often never had this awful service usually the other supervisor Belinda is usually on top of things. I don't think they understand the severity of eating non food items!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
13,Timothy R.,"San Diego, CA",64,63,21.0,4.0,2015-03-18,"Okay, I have been here several times since I started Yelping. So to get to the nuts and bolts, the the Food is Generally good to excellent. I have some disappointing experiences here with the food. I will never do the Fish and Chips again, no matter how well or different they are cooked, that one time I had them it was the straw that broke the Camels Back the old grease and mushy and cold. I have only tried a few things on Appetizer menu and the Brisket Nachos are, I say are not what they appear to portray in either the menu description  or quality of the dish. The manager Dawn on both of these occasions was very good with us and discounted the products off of the bill. All in all the service is good to excellent depending on the server.  parking is normally good to fair as well as wait for seating except when the Blue Hairs are in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
11,Suzette R.,"Yuma, AZ",12,20,8.0,3.0,2015-12-08,"First time ordering Carside to Go.  Said it would be ready in 15mins. Ended up waiting 45mins not including the 15 and still waiting for my order. I kept seeing the workers from the Carside to Go section coming out in groups and going to the parking lot and just chilling. If it was going to take longer then I would have been fine with them telling me a longer ready time.  Yet, I was told  short period which gave my hopes up and came here and now I'm stuck waiting.  Besides the time and seeing the workers lollygagging I really like this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
10,Cory W.,"Warner Robins, GA",0,9,,2.0,2016-03-27,"I've been going to Applebees around the country for years. It's always represented a place for a simple, affordable sit down meal. Applebees seems to have lost its way recently. I ordered a salad and steak dinner from the lighter fare menu. The salad was soggy with old lettuce. The steak, potatoes, and toppings was very plain and bland. In addition, the restaurant was dirty and smelled bad. To top if off, the food was very pricy for the portion you received. This chain needs help to get back to the basics of making good food again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
9,Chris S.,"Yuma, AZ",0,38,25.0,2.0,2016-04-20,"Ate here with my father. I have not eaten here in years, now I might remember why. The only reason I am giving 2 stars, is that the service and the appetizer were good. We ordered boneless wings for an appetizer. We both enjoyed them, they were not overcooked nor over sauced. I ordered the classic cheeseburger with the house chips. It was terrible, I could only eat half of it. The meat just had an old frozen, it should of been thrown out the day before, taste too it. The house chips were good, hot and crisp. My father ordered the ribs. He said they were OK, he has tasted better. He was not impressed with it and said that it seems the quality of food from Applebee's has gone down hill. Service was good. Server was punctual and attentive, but I do not remember her asking if our food was OK. I severely doubt I will be back, it might be a few years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
0,Paul J.,"Yuma, AZ",75,527,1400.0,4.0,2016-06-16,Update: the cheese sauce is worth ordering the pretzel on the two for one apps. The cheese burger rolls taste like a cheese burger but in the most fun way possible. The pork chip Diner was tender and juicy. The beans were not good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
8,Greg N.,"Chino, CA",222,10,1.0,1.0,2016-08-31,I understand this is Yuma but I thought this was a corporate restaurant. I ordered 45 minutes ago at the bar and not even a side salad has come out. Bartenders are very friendly and fun but there is obviously a break down in management and kitchen staff. Horrible service from the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
7,Valerie C.,"Yuma, AZ",12,61,28.0,2.0,2016-10-23,Got carside to go. Baked potato was supposed to have butter and sour cream - had neither. Steak was more fat than meat and overcooked. Salad was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
4,Winter E.,"Yuma, AZ",21,28,68.0,1.0,2016-11-16,"Messed the order up 3 times. Service was slow and the food was not that great. Not impressed. I had the lime chicken, it was ok. My boyfriend had traditional wings. First order came out as boneless, next order came out lemon pepper with a little hot sauce. Not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
2,Patti M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",23,20,2.0,1.0,2016-11-29,"The service was terrible.  We ordered the chicken fingers with fries, our food was served 30 minutes later COLD.  I sent it back, it took another 15 minutes to get our order then we could not get our server back for our bill.  I asked for the manager to complain and this woman should be fired.. She told us they were short staffed and there was nothing she could do about it.  I've never been treated so rudely in a restaurant.  I will never take my family there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
3,Dean C.,"Yuma, AZ",2,6,,1.0,2016-12-23,Now I know why I don't eat at Applebees. More noddles than greens in Oriental salad. Chicken way too dry like its been sitting under warmer too long. Over priced.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,,,,,
6,MariAnn S.,"Yuma, AZ",0,10,,5.0,2017-03-08,Had a great time while dining at this applebees! Their GM Mandi is the sweetest person ever! She totally brightened my day! I will definitely be back to this applebees!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
1,Kathleen H.,"Yuma, AZ",12,20,9.0,2.0,2017-07-09,"Waitress was very pleasant.  Appetizer came out was very good. Order Bake French Onion Soup didn't come out until the meal arrived. Ordered the Shrimp with the grilled Chicken Broccoli and garlic potatoes.  Shrimp was tasty broccoli was blan, the look of the garlic potato the way they were placed on the plate was very unappealing.  Appeared to have been squeezed from a tube...I'm sure you can imagine how that looked on your plate....need I say more. The Chicken I took one bite, while chewing felt like it wasn't cooked long enough. Probably will be the last time I'll eat at Applebee's anywhere. Quality vs Price...I just can't see spending any more on their meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
5,Alizé M.,"Fresno, CA",11,5,8.0,1.0,2017-07-13,"Was ordering over the phone for ""carside to go"" she sounded like she didn't know what she was doing didn't even tell me my total and just hung up on me. Now upon arrival we waited out in the car for 15 minutes before a girl came out saying we had to go inside and pay and walked away... when we walked inside and up to the cash register at the bar a girl that worked there I think she was the host(she wasn't at her post when we first walked in mind you) walked straight up to me and rudely said ""uhm excuse me you can't just walk in like that can I help you"" to my little niece by then I was pissed off and over it. If I could give them no stars on there rating I would and by the way the food was gross",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-yuma-8,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
