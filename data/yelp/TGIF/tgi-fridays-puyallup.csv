Nancy B.,"Hudson, OH",136,446,1662,3.0,6/16/2009,"BOGO entree coupon got us to give this location another try. We went late at night and (1 other party in the whole dining room) and the service was still slow. The waitress wasn't even busy with side work... she was talking with people in the bar... other employees... anyone but us.... we sent a star after her... it never came back.  The fried green beans were awesome, the flat iron was a perfect medium, but the bacon wrapped shrimp were covered with Jack Daniels sauce and still had the tails on!!  Automatic loss of 1 star for slathering sauce all over the tails!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-puyallup
Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586,2.0,4/22/2007,"It's cloudy out, so I'm worried about lightning bolts striking me for saying this... but even the damn Olive Garden across the parking lot is better! And Red Robin is too. Hell, even the hated Applebee's at the other side of the mall has better service. We went here yesterday after a long day at the fair, tired and somewhat shell-shocked. The overly perky hostess took us to the very back of the restaurant, which we soon regretted. Our server was Michael and he was one of the best of the bunch, with a winning smile and a good level of attentiveness, though we did have to hunt him down once for a drink refill (but every other time we needed him, he was nearby, so OK). I ordered a turkey bacon cheeseburger on whole wheat, lettuce only. One kid ordered spaghetti and mandarin oranges with a kids' slushy drink, my husband ordered the pot sticker appetizer for his meal, and the other kid got chicken fingers and fries and a slushy.  My Diet Coke didn't have a lime, but two of the kid slushies did, so I just snagged one from them, no biggie. The food was reasonably good, though I got a beef burger instead of a turkey patty; I was too tired to care much since the rest of the burger was as I ordered it, though the two slices of bacon were two of the tiniest ones I've seen, easily equal to only one Red Robin slice (and their burgers include THREE slices of bacon). The fries were good but overly seasoned. So the food was probably three stars, our actual waiter was three stars, restaurant cleanliness was about a 2.5... but the rude bullshit coming out of the kitchen (right behind us) was a one-star performance. Between the ""FUCK yous"" and the other colorful name-calling peppering the loud teenager-heavy kitchen banter, and the fact that we were next to the ""break table"" for four other staff members, it was way more than I wanted to hear. Unprofessional at best, and I could see being downright offended if you were too religious for swearing. I don't care if the place is staffed by teenagers almost exclusively; so is Red Robin, and the service is actually usually pretty good there. But that's because there's always an adult manager or two, who set a good example and keep the kids working and more or less toned down on the loud banter and foul language. The adult manager at TGI Friday's was a true disaster. She was maybe 40, and dressed in something shamefully spangly, and she was hanging all over her very drunk boyfriend? husband? who had just been dropped off by a drinking buddy because he was way beyond the point of driving himself home. She was proud of his manly drunkenness, which included an unlit cigarette firmly clamped in his fingers.  It was at that point that I realized we'd found South Hill's WTC (White Trash Capital). The meal went from a fairly average farce in an unpleasant environment to sheer entertainment. Too bad I was too tired to really enjoy it, and I also wasn't especially proud of these folks' behavior in front of my girls... but the 7 year old fell asleep on the bench and was spared the worst of the language. We won't be back, comedic staff or not. Red Robin is a solid performer and that Olive Garden is the best one I've ever been to (I'd actually give it 4 stars, consistently, even though I'd choose Mama Stortini's a few miles away if it were up to me).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-puyallup

Nick D.,"Puyallup, WA",25,570,14,2.0,4/11/2006,"I'm not a fan of TGI Friday's and not fond of this location either.  Every time I've been here they have messed up my order and there's been somethingwrong with my food.  The drinks are decent here, better than those served at Red Robin 100 feet away but they don't really do much for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-puyallup
