Komatsu O.,Las Vegas  NV,140,46,52,11/10/2017,5.0,I'm sorry hands down 5 star! We went to BJs up north Las Vegas and absolutely loved it! The servers and managers were so helpful and friendly and the food was on point!Henderson location is the same! Our server was so attentive and we were in the bar area! Even the guy that gave us our food was so happy and excited. They never rushed us and they made sure that were attended to.My fish and chips was very crispy and flavorful. The veggie (vegan) was tasty and garnished perfectly! My wife had to have the Poke Salad again and it was just as perfect as before. We signed up for the app  got a free dessert And started earning points!Check them out!
Ryan F.,Las Vegas  NV,74,29,110,10/29/2017,4.0,Ok first of all any and all dog friendly restaurants get 4 stars. Bjs also happens to have a wide variety of tasty eats and they brew there own beer...big bonus and a wide variety of other brews and cocktails.  I mostly get veggie burgers you can substitute veggie or portobello on any of the burger selections. They also offer vegan friendly apps etc.  My wife gets mini deep dish pizza and says it's fantastic.  Today I had Bjs Jeremiah Red house beer and then tried the Jerry Burst  that is berry burst cider mixed with Jeremiah Red. Pretty tasty it turns the beer into more of a sweet treat.  That wraps today's visit.
Gina T.,San Jose  CA,50,111,467,10/12/2017,5.0,I went to different BJ's over the years and hardly have any bad experience with them. Their food are exceptional and always received excellent service  especially at this location. The server that helped us were super friendly and constantly checked on us. We didn't even have to ask for the refill with our drinks.We ordered the following itemsAppetizers:Chicken wings $11.50 - ask them to split in half buffalo and root beer glaze. Very crunchy and little oil. 4.8/5Avocado egg rolls $11.50 - still prefer the one from Cheesecake but their tamarind sauce is good though 3.5/5Crispy calamari $11. 50 - pretty much similar to other restaurants but not that oily. 4.2/5Entrees:-full back pork ribs Thursday promo $17.95 it came with two items and a mini pizookie - worth getting this deal if you happen to come here on Thursday. The sauce amount of sauce was perfectly applied to the ribs and the meat was super tender 4.8/5-seared ahi salad - $15.95 - my brother ate the meat and I ate the salad. Their rice vinaigrette sauce wasn't that sour 4.4/5-seafood tacos $10.75 - my brother said the seafood was well marinated and he would give it 4/5 :-). -steak top sirloin - $16.50 nothing special about this dish 3.8/5-Shrimp & asparagus pasta - $16.95 - too salty and somehow the flavor wasn't there 3/5- tavern cut flatbread brew house classic with pineapple - $17.25 must eat it while it still hot but very crunchy. They burned it a little though 3.5/5- Tavern cut garlic chicken pesto $15.95 - too dry would be better if they have little bit more sauce 3.5/5-Spaghetti with meatballs $9.99 - my daughter regret that she she ordered this dish. The dish was too dried and nothing special with the sauce. 2.5/5I opted not to order my dish so I could try out all the dishes :-). Anyhow  I love their root beer drink.
Poco P.,Las Vegas  NV,1581,350,2533,9/21/2017,5.0,Taylor  our server is taylor-made for excellent customer service  knowledge over beers/beverages  the menu & overall is the perfect person you'd want to get when taking your parents out for dinner. Mom only likes thin crust pizza & dad loves beer  neither have been to BJ's cause where they used to live doesn't have one so trusted me to order for them. Taylor helped w/ the beer & since it's Oktoberfest  brought us a sample. Mom & I decided on the four-beer tasting & dad got the Oktoberfest Lager. Paired perfectly w/ our pizza & the Cardinal's baseball game as we sat in a large lounge booth. (Mom & I's ratings of our Four-Beer Tasting .. Harvest Hef & Oktoberfest were our fav! Jeremiah Red was Tangy & the Brewette was heavy.)I ordered them my fav's & the best of both worlds  savory & sweet! The BJ's Classic Combo 9' Deep Dish Pizza & the mini Salted Caramel Pizookie to share! They loved it & mom said it wa the best deep dish ever! I ordered off the salad & pizza off of the lunch menu. The seasonal Watermelon & Feta Salad  was lite  delish & the watermelon was sweet! Also a 6' Deep Dish Pepperoni Pizza. We arrived earlier than the happy hour  which starts at 3pm  but they have an excellent lunch menu & portion size is filling! Overall  an A+ experience & I have dined at this BJ's about five times before. I have sat twice in the dining area & the rest at the bar/lounge area. I love the beers & food  but mostly Taylor stood out enough for me to want to leave a five star review. Thank you!
Lori R.,Las Vegas  NV,126,57,453,9/16/2017,4.0,The last few times I've come  its been nothing but good. Today I ordered the Barbacoa Chicken and I was very much pleased. Looking for something healthy this is a good choice. The chicken was cooked to perfection. Juicy and not dried. And the barbacoa-spiced flavor was just ... mmmm.... good. Chicken was tooped with the fire roasted tomato salsa which complemented well with the chicken and brown rice.  I couldn't stop raving on how good this chicken was. I omitted the black beans. The brown rice was topped with feta cheese  cilantro  and crema. I honestly didn't care for the crema. But other than that  awesome. If I could make my chicken like this everyday  I could eat this everyday. Staff is friendly and service was great. In the past I've tried their lunch Spaghetti with meatballs and that too was really good. Although the menu is big with a variety of choices (which I hate only because there is sooooo much good stuff to choose from)  everything so far has been delish and this is definitly a place to go too for your picky eaters in your group.
Love G.,Henderson  NV,76,50,61,7/28/2017,5.0,Came here a while ago and never got the chance to leave a review! We waited about 5-10 minutes for our party of three and were seated in a booth. While waiting  they had posters of different specials they had each day  and I believe their burgers were 50% off one day and they also had $3 pizookies on Tuesdays! I decided to try their Long Island Ice Tea  and let me tell you - the strongest I've had it so far! Also worth it. Ordered the avocado bacon burger well done and got some fries with it. My mom ordered the chicken alfredo pasta and my uncle ordered a different pasta with shrimp in it but I can't remember the exact name. Service was a little slow but it's understandable because it during a dinner rush! My uncle had never been to a BJ's restaurant so we ordered the trio pizookie option and got peanut butter  salted caramel  and white chocolate macadamia nut. And for about $9  that's a GREAT price considering you can try THREE different pizookies!
Nicole P.,Las Vegas  NV,452,126,1307,9/24/2017,4.0,It was my first time eating at BJ's so I didn't know what to expect. A client took me to eat here with her family and we were on a time crunch  but the service was fast and the food was great. This location is far from me  but if I happen to find one closer  I might try out the rest of their menu! Sorry this one is short & sweet. :P
Richard S.,Henderson  NV,0,65,45,6/27/2017,3.0,Been here before but disappointed this time. I had the Lemon Thyme Chicken. The chicken was very tender but the roasted Brussel sprouts and brown rice were swimming in the liquid. Very sloppy. The flavors weren't that distinctive. Just a mish mash. The chicken tasted more poached than grilled. One of our diners ordered her entree when the rest of us ordered our appetizers. When she ordered her enter the server said it was put in with the appetizers and couldn't be changed. Wrong answer! The server was rather surely. Even seemed bothered that my wife asked flor extra ranch dressing. We'll be back but we hope our experience and will be back up to our previous times.
Karen W.,North Las Vegas  NV,9,67,69,11/8/2017,4.0,Whenever in doubt  I can always trust BJ's! Always Have my blonde beer  and appetizers! Had the sliders  and glazed ribs..excellent!
Linda S.,Las Vegas  NV,267,50,207,8/12/2017,5.0,Yummy in my tummy!! I love how many options they have. All of them sounded so good at the time and I had a really hard time choosing my entree. I decided on the ahi salad and loved every bit of it. My brother and cousin also enjoyed their plates. Our waitress was pretty cool  checked up on us fairly often and made sure our waters were filled. Now that I think about it  I only reason I went was to use my gift card. I forgot to apply it so yes  will definitely be back soon for a happy hour. Also  their pizookies are bomb.com!! If you sign up for their free rewards program  you get a free mini pizookie. ;) You're welcome!
Eddie B.,Enterprise  NV,0,14,16,11/12/2017,4.0,First time trying this BJ's   honestly over all it was pretty good. We got a salad which was delicious and a fried chicken burger with a spinach dip. Let me start by saying the service was amazing  but ... the fried chicken as funny as that sounds is a beef patty  but that's not the issue  my issue was the patty smelled and tasted funny. We let the waiter know and he jumped to take it out of the bill for us ... which is fine  but honestly I would have much appreciated if he had asked what the issue with it was so it doesn't happen again than just taking it of the bill. It didn't make me feel good to have him not ask what the issue was and follow up on it. Other than that  the rest of the food and the ambiance was pretty good.
Loreal G.,Las Vegas  NV,239,146,284,8/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"Today was the standard 1st day of school dinner for my son and I. As usual most of the food was great (mahi/shrimp tacos  and stuffed mushroom appetizer) but my sons chicken tenders and fries were just ok. They literally came out 3 minutes after I ordered them but they weren\'t up to typical BJs standard. Shame on me for ordering from the kids menu. The berry cider was decent but I sure do miss the pear cider  I\'ll live. Amy was our server and she was great  she was fast  friendly and anyone would be lucky to have her as their server. Oh and unless the food is horrendous I don\'t complain I just don\'t order it next time or I don\'t go back. I\'m not a ""talk to the manager"" kinda gal. I\'ve been here a ton of times and I\'ve just about filtered out what\'s good and what\'s not. Just remember that you can\'t go wrong on Mondays when a large pizza is half off!"
Ayanna J.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,22,13,35,9/17/2017,1.0,The food at BJs is just ok. Definitely not a place for dinner. I recommend you go here for beer and finger foods
Ivy K.,Paradise  NV,11,16,36,10/25/2017,4.0,Online order review: I placed my order around 3:45pm for a 5:15pm pick up. Traffic was in my favorite that day and was parked curbside at BJ's at 5pm. I followed the directions and called letting them know that I'm here to pick up. The nice gentleman said that my order just came thought and should be out in 10 tens. Sure enough  ten minutes later a nice lady came out with all my food. I received my food and she ran my card and I was on my way. The food was hot and delicious! For my first curbside experience I know to be on time next time around!
Stephan C.,Burbank  CA,114,59,3,9/10/2017,2.0,My friend and I went to the Henderson  NV restaurant on July 20  2017. I ordered a chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. My friend had the bison burger. First the sandwich. I come from NY. A club sandwich  aka Triple-Decker has FRESH turkey  bacon  lettuce/tomato with 3 slices of bread and mayo. THAT is a REAL club sandwich. A sliced chicken sandwich from processed chicken as you'd get in a deli on 2 slices of bread is NOT a club sandwich  not now  not ever. I didn't eat it and turned it back  then didn't order anything else. The fries were sparse. The coleslaw.... large chunks of cabbage in a tiny bowl. I make awesome coleslaw at home and have had some of the best coleslaw outside. But this... surely needs to be changed. NEVER use large pieces of cabbage... just as you wouldn't put a thick piece of tomato on a sandwich. This was about the worst I've had.My friend's burger... dried  nothing special. The waitress was great.Personally  I should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant  where everything is tasteless and way over-salted. My fault.We are very disappointed and will not return. America... Chain restaurants  ala Red Lobster and Olive Garden  use loads of sodium. We all know that no matter how old we are  salt is bad for your heart. If not as a teen  then when you get older. It's a fact. Why chains do this is beyond me. Red Lobster packs their fish in frozen ice salt. Their sauces are way oversalted. This is what they told me. Same for Olive Garden. Salt does not bring out the taste... it eventually hurts your organs. Better to find a mom 'n pop shop  not a corporate chain restaurant.There is no shortage of restaurants. Be wise when you choose. I do not suggest BJ's as your place of choice to eat.. 2 times there and I'm done.
Destinee P.,Las Vegas  NV,52,86,39,6/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I have came to this place a few times. It's very spacious and seems like a nice place to hang out. The food is amazing. The menu is very big which gives you so many options. I like to try different things every time I come here. My favorite drink is the pink Cadillac. It's so good  not too fruity but still pretty awesome. I live pretty close so if I ever want to grab a quick meal and hang out this is the place. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who like a great meal  a great drink and able to just relax and be at a place where you can just be yourself and not have to over dress.
Caitlin B.,Las Vegas  NV,192,142,131,5/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Came here on Tuesday around 7pm. There was no wait to be seated but it was pretty busy in general. They had a lot of specials going on including half off bottle wine  happy hour and 3$ pizookies. They are also doing buy one entree get one entree free with purchase of two beverages. We ended up with two entrees  an appetizer  and two glasses of wine for 42$! Our server was great too. Portion sizes are good and there is a good variety on the menu.
Katrina P.,Las Vegas  NV,898,273,186,5/21/2017,4.0,We always end up at BJs at one time or another because it's such an easy and casual place to grab a bite to eat and drink to drank! If you're looking for a wide range of food choices  great drinks and beer  a casual atmosphere and friendly service  BJs is a great place for lunch or dinner. We've come with family  friends  and our little one and it never disappoints. The food is a-okay and nothing to write home about but filling for what you're craving. I love the roasted brussel sprouts  salads  and sandwich combos!
Danbee T.,Las Vegas  NV,174,57,90,8/27/2017,5.0,great spot to come for a bite with friends with a wide range of beers and drink specials. i've tried multiple things on the menu  but usually stick to the chicken mediterranean tacos. tried the new salmon pita tacos which were also awesome! grilled salmon with a creamy aioli  crispy green apples and a slaw with toasted  candied walnuts! pita is soft and the side quinoa/couscous is a refreshing palate cleanser between bites. the root beer glazed chicken wings were great. right amount of crispy bite without drying out the inside and the glaze is not overly sweet. my boyfriend loved the crispy chicken salad with the honey mustard style dressing and my bestie loved the wings. we come here once in a blue moon  but overall  for the beer selection & consistency with food quality  i would definitely recommend this spot if you want a little contemporary american cuisine variety. service can be a hit or miss when dining  but i have noticed that the bar seating area with RACHEL is always a win. having had different servers there  i would definitely say she is the friendliest & best at her job. hard to find servers that actually care nowadays about the service quality  so if you're picky about service  find her! definitely worth a shoutout BJ's!
Joseph A.,Henderson  NV,2,33,41,4/20/2017,1.0,Hosts were rude and short upon arrival.  We were dismissed at first then given instructions to stand and wait. Hostess that seated us sprinted to the table and seemed irritated we were behind. Zero engagement. Dining room was empty as well as the bar area. Dining room was dark  even my 14 yr old needed a flashlight to see the menu.Server was prompt and got our order accurately but again there was zero engagement. No suggestions just took our order. Food was ok nothing exciting. If you are just looking to run in and run out maybe this is the place to you. We've been a few times and it has progressively gotten worse  although the hostess seem to be consistently rude.Won't be back for a while if at all  I can get good food at home  I go out for the whole experience.
Patty M.,Henderson  NV,148,51,7,11/1/2017,2.0,This was our second visit to BJ's. We dined at a time when the sun setting and the shades they have are not sufficient to block it out. We were all seeing spots in our eyes for quite a while from the brightness. We asked to change our table  and the second one was a little better but there was still too much sun filtering through the shades. they have what looks like wooden blinds in the front of the restaurant that they should also put on the side windows. Our server was very friendly  but severely lacking in being observant and listening. She took drink orders for my husband and son  but didn't ask me if I wanted anything. I ordered a dinner salad with chicken. Son had a steak and husband had a quinoa bowl. I am a rather slow eater  and my family finished before me. The server came over and asked if we were ready for dessert. I was shocked  as I was clearly still eating. I told her I was still enjoying my salad and she said the pizzookie takes a while  so we should order it even though I was still eating. Well  here I am eating my dinner and less than 5 minutes later the food runner brings this hot cookie topped with ice cream over to our table. I called our server over and told her I was still eating. She asked me if I wanted a box for my salad. I said no  and SHE TOOK IT RIGHT OUT FROM IN FRONT OF ME! MY FORK WAS STILL IN MY HAND! She also left the check and told us to have a good evening. When she came back for the check  I told her I was shocked that she insisted we order dessert while I was still eating and that she also took my meal before I was finished. She smiled  asked if I enjoyed it and made no apologies. When I asked for a manager  she said she was new and would get in trouble  left the check for me to sign and we didn't see her again. My son said while the steak was good  he felt a little queazy after the meal. I enjoyed the salad  but would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to finish it. I hope a manager reads this and responds appropriately.
Urian B.,Las Vegas  NV,287,83,142,4/8/2017,4.0,This location is pretty solid on service and food quality  so no real complaints. I really like BJ's for what it is: a chain restaurant with a thousand options that's open kinda late. Happy hour could be a little happier on the pricing I think.Pizzas are good  but not grand. Tomato bisque here is the god  though. Get the bisque! Monkey bread pizookie is also a winner in my book. Glad to see that option has stuck around on the menu for a while now. Love their fries  too.Totally worth it to sign up for their emails. Free pizookies and decent dollar amount off promotions all the time!
Keisha C.,Henderson  NV,10,15,8,7/25/2017,3.0,$3 PizookieTuesdayssss  whaaaat?!@!! And half off wine It has been over 5 years since I've eaten here and honestly it wasn't too bad. We had a party of 7 lol. Family dinner night! Our table ordered...Mahi Mahi tacos. You can choose between fried or grilled topped with some cabbage  pico de gallo and i think it's some kind of aioli. De-lish!My love got fish & chips and the couscous macncheese. Fish was pretty good. Batter just a hair too much for him BUT that couscous was really good! Who would of thunk?? Couscous mac.Garlic chicken pesto pizza. G-double O-D-GOOD!Sisters got boneless Siracha chicken wings and a guac burger (bleh  b/c I'm *cough* allergic to avacado. And the little cousin got a kids cheese pizza which by the way looked really good and he said  it was delicious And for desert  pizookie of course. Peanut butter  salted caramel  chocolate chunk  monkey bread pizookie. All were delicious and only $3 on Tuesday for a normal sizeAs for our server  she was awesome. I feel horrible bc I don't remember her name BUT she kept our drinks filled  was knowledgeable on the menu  and was fun! I definitely will come back to try other dishes on the menu and will be back for $3 Tuesday pizookies.
Colin C.,Las Vegas  NV,54,176,161,7/13/2016,5.0,I seriously love this place. I had never been to a BJ's until I moved to Vegas last year and now I realize that they are not only on the west coast but spreading back east. Everything I've tried in the 6 or so visits has been delicious. From the deep dish pizza to the jambalaya  to the ribs  Pazookies... All very tasty! In the past  Cheesecake Factory would be my go to place for a large menu with a lot of great choices but BJ's has certainly replaced CF for me. Every time I leave  I cannot wait to go again. During my last visit  I was introduced to their mobile app which I can use to pay and earn rewards. I love user friendly tech additions so BJ's really won me over with this one. If you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price  definitely give this place a shot.
Shawn C.,Las Vegas  NV,1,37,,10/24/2017,3.0,"I\'ve been to this location a few times  but this review is based upon my experience today:Positives: Waitress was outstanding - right amount of checking and staying away  a true proSat promptly once both in our party arrived for lunchEverything was very cleanNegatives:Only one - if you are putting a sandwich on the ""lunch menu"" at a ""reduced price""  I still expect it to be a decent sandwich. 2 thin slices of ham on a ham and grilled cheese does not cut it  especially at the low  low price of $9.50  c\'mon. Sorry  but I go out to eat for the food  so this significantly drags down my overall experience (flavor was ok).I would still recommend this restaurant  but avoid this paltry sandwich."
Luis F.,Henderson  NV,2,36,130,12/5/2016,5.0,This is a great BJ's  our waitress has been awesome. The service here is and has been . We've landed the same waitress twice and we're so happy. The food has also been good and definitely recommend coming here for lunch. We got seated pretty fast  so that's pretty good.
Sam O.,Las Vegas  NV,105,95,210,1/11/2017,4.0,Had a really great experience here recently! The waiter was very nice and prompt ! I had the triple decker and it was very tasty ! My wife had the pepperoni flat bread and unfortunately was a little on the greasy side !!We love eating here because of all the choices and atmosphere is nice !!
Billie B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,24,6,7/20/2017,5.0,Stopped in here for a late lunch. Sat at the bar and Bill was our server/bartender. Bill was dope and super helpful. I love when people seem to actually enjoy their job  makes for a good reason to come back and ask for them by name. He's a great bartender and when I asked him to make me a surprise cocktail he didn't hesitate and made a great drink. Keep it up Bill. Pizza came out perfect as usual. I've never had a bad bjs pizza though. Good pizza. Great service. We'll be back to this location soon.
Jonathan Z.,Henderson  NV,25,18,7,9/26/2017,4.0,Great variety on menu. Beer list is varied as well.  They sometimes have good beer from their own brewer. The sound is loud. I like their bar and bartenders. The Great White is my favorite white pizza and I usually don't like white pizzas but almost always at least order the mini here even if I am ordering other foods.  Their soups are all greAt!
Spero D.,Henderson  NV,33,11,,6/7/2017,1.0,What a zero establishment. When I got the check  they inserted a business card for Mr. Uphoff  the manager. This implies that he is concerned about your opinion. Not even close. If you are unfortunate enough to get the waitress Jeramie  run. Cold  uninterested  useless and doesn't care about the customer or her job. I wrote Mr. Uphoff a detailed email detailing our experience commenting on positives and negatives. No Response. Not even an auto reply. Zip. After 4 days I forwarded it to corporate. No Response. They are disinterested. Go elsewhere. They food is marginal  service is weak and I spent $65 for lunch for 3 people. No drinks at all. Seriously. Any place is better.
Terry M.,Las Vegas  NV,35,37,1,1/29/2017,4.0,Our first and second time here was an awesome experience!   The food was on par  the service was excellent and we even got the manager to come to our table and take a pic with us and a friend we had brought in with us to try their famous Pazookie dessert.I tried the deep dish Pepperoni and 5 cheese pizza and my ex had a BBQ Brisket sandwich. We practice Dicing 2 eat so the die each made us try a different drink  I had a Black cherry handcrafted soda which I didnt think was that great and he had a soda.  Super crowded but that is usually a good sign and wait time was very minimal.  oh and they have a revolving door to get in and out which I love!The second time we came here  I tried the Paella.  Delicious  not as spicy as they claim it to be but most of the food that people say is spicy doesnt really seem so much so to me  I am so used to eating really spicy food I guess :/   My friend had a steak which was excellent of course.Our Third experience here which was tonight was not that great as far as service goes.  It started off alright and of course the food was excellent as always  The die made me try a flatbread pizza which for me was new as I usually prefer deep dish when we come here  I have had a mini deep dish in the past which was awesome!   My ex who was with me had to try a cocktail called The Strawberry Smash which he said he liked.  And he ordered the bbq Brisket sandwich again which was just as good as the first time he ordered it.  Great thing about Bj's seems to be the food is always consistantly good!When we finished eating though  service became slow and they werent that busy  our waiter disappeared and we waited a full 15 minutes before we finally asked a random server if he could bring us to go boxes for the leftover pizza  some for me  some for him to take.  We waited another 10 mins and never saw our server again  we asked if someone else could take the check for us so we could get going and the man told us that our server was in the back and he would make sure he was told we were ready to go.  Another 10 mins and we were still waiting so we asked a 3rd server if we could pay and he took the credit card and came back a few minutes later.We never saw our server again  no goodbye  sayonara  adios  nothing!  No worries though  we are 20%++ tippers when we are happy and we just were not this time  next time we will ask for a different server.
Presley W.,Henderson  NV,143,7,,9/28/2017,5.0,Bjs is definitely underrated!! I honestly forgot it even exists till recently i've been addicted! definitely fresh delicious food!!! the lunch & dinner options vary my favorite is the santa fe chick salad ahhhhh it is so bomb!!! of course i please myself to a monkey bread pizookie just to make sure i'm extra full & satisfied so i have a difficult time walking to the car lol.. ALSO they have curbside pick up!! or take out orders & the service is always great!
Ricardo M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,13,,5/15/2017,3.0,Only getting 3 stars because of the food !!! Horrible service   took about atleast 10 minutes to be greeted. Server looked like they didnt care much. Ordered my sons food  waited a bit to order mine thinking i would get his quick so he can eat first. funny to say my food STILL came out before his. What a joke!! Awesome food but man get some new staff!
Roo B.,Las Vegas  NV,4,42,4,8/6/2017,5.0,First time at a BJ's...don't know why I waited so long! Great menu options  but opted for the cherry chipotle salmon dish. WOW! Very nice flavors  perfectly cooked. Nice and healthy too. Our server was amazing! Never let our jack and cokes get empty :) Most definitely coming back for the salmon!
Jason C.,Henderson  NV,1,27,1,9/12/2017,3.0,The atmosphere is very welcoming. I ordered a oasis amber beer that was perfect. I also ordered the top sirloin. The steak was just okay  I had to drown it in steak sauce to finish it. The one thing I found to be off putting was the tablet each waitress carries. I felt like I was giving my order to a fast food worker with no personality. I would return  but with lower expectations.
Scott K.,Henderson  NV,0,7,,11/13/2017,2.0,Excellent food and service and atmosphere. Problem is extremely expensive food prices. Two lunches with just water should not cost $50. Please lower your prices. We will not be back until prices are lowered.
Gabriel S.,Las Vegas  NV,122,113,849,12/4/2016,5.0,"Came to this location at 10:30pm on a Sunday night with a friend for a night cap. We got a booth right next to a TV so I could watch sports center while women ramble as usual. Any who.. I got dry rub wings and she got a portobello mushrooms salad  along with a ""Strawberry Splash"" with a little extra vodka inside ;-) Our server Brandon was great  he even took a few bucks off the meal simply because he\'s cool like that! Only other BJ\'s I\'ve been towas in California. I didn\'t know they were a national franchise company. I\'m sure I\'ll return soon. Now that I know about this location. I recommend this place for a nice dinner. Prices not too bad either. Bring 40- 70 bucks with you for 2 people."
Anthony M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,9/27/2017,5.0,Love this place. I have been eating here for the last couple of years. Everything on the menu is great. I really like the pizza as well. Service has always been very good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
David V.,Las Vegas  NV,278,30,11,9/13/2017,5.0,Definitely a better experience this time. I had a RibEye Steak w Spinach Dip for an appetizer and enjoyed both of them. They were pretty busy but my food came quick and the waiter Dan was very attentive.
Gabe S.,Las Vegas  NV,13,34,53,6/9/2017,4.0,I went there in a Friday afternoon and was sat right away even though the place looked really busy. The waitress was really friendly. Food was good. I had the mozzarella sticks which could be served with more marinara sauce. I also had the BBQ salad which as awesome. I asked for Tabasco from a passing waitress who forgot to bring it but the main waitress brought I right away when I asked. Also had some drinks that I thought were on happy hour but we were not sitting in the bar area  so happy hour didn't apply. It would have been nice to know that beforehand. Overall it was a really nice and I enjoyed it.
Shannon W.,Rogue River  OR,0,5,14,9/16/2017,5.0,We love the casual atmosphere and consistency of this place  but the stars go to our server  Rachel. It is quite difficult to dine out with a severe lily allergy. With that being said  she and the rest of staff took extraordinary measures to protect me from a reaction. They created a dish that was so perfect  I actually cleaned the plate. Thank you so very much  I know where I can eat without suffering afterwards! Xx
Trixie N.,Las Vegas  NV,873,269,2921,1/17/2016,4.0,BJs is a favorite for our family. There is always something for everyone when it comes to food and beer selection. Depending on the time of day you arrive  you will probably wait and have to park in the adjacent lot. One trick we used to do growing up that we still do  is drop one person off at the door to put our name down while the other parks. It saves time! At BJs  they have a skinny menu that tells you the calories for the items. For those who don't care  there plenty of higher calorie tasty menu items as well- Burgers  Pizza flatbreads  etcBJs has also jumped on the Sriracha band wagon  a favorite hot sauce to us Asians. They have created a Mac and cheese with Sriracha sauce... Amazing! My daughter likes this dish and I have taken several bites off her plate  I do like it. If you want something spicy or have kids that have jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon  this is a GoTo.I really enjoy their lower calorie items like the seared Ahi tuna salad or their quinoa bowls. The ahi tuna salad is just fantastic. A large bowl of greens  with dabs of wasabi sauce on the sides of the dish. The ahi tuna is nicely seared and adds a fab protein. Highly recommend!
Brian F.,Las Vegas  NV,19,116,261,3/29/2016,4.0,This place has decent food  variety of everything  big menu  full bar  open late. This review is mainly for their Pizzokie's! My go to place to get these wonderful things. Half cooked melty gooey cookie with cold ice cream on top. Hard to beat.Recently came here - I order the Pizzokie trio and the new monkey bread Pizzokie. I ordered the classic (Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla ice cream)  cookies and cream cookie with vanilla ice cream  salted caramel cookie with vanilla ice cream.All were fantastic - the salted caramel with pretzel was my favoriteThe new monkey Bread had great flavor and was delicious! It isn't true monkey bread - but for what it was it was really good!
Ellen A.,Las Vegas  NV,11,13,1,9/1/2017,2.0,On 8/31/17  friends we hadn't seen in over 3 years wanted to take us out. We chose BJ's because even though they are a little pricey  the food has always been good. Not sure what happened but the experience was not what we anticipated. I ordered chicken cobb salad (how can salad get screwed up?). Not sure if it was the dressing  lettuce or cucumber but tasted like it had been doused with bad cologne. My gut still wrenches at the thought. Didn't complain because didn't want to embarrass friends  and they were buying. Just packed up what was left  took it home and threw it out. Husband ordered spaghetti which he said was extremely dry. He didn't want to complain for same reason as me. If I was paying that salad would've been sent back! I'll give you one more chance BJ's. Don't disappoint me.
Abigail T.,Henderson  NV,191,6,,9/9/2017,5.0,BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants! The staff is always very nice and the food is amazing. I usually get the boneless wings (1 LB. of boneless wings for like $12!) and the two best flavors are the dry rub Sriracha or the garlic Parmesan. You can also ask them to do half of the Sriracha and half of the garlic Parmesan. My other favorite thing to order is the guacamole bacon burger. It's amazing and so tasty!
Adelita A.,Henderson  NV,0,9,2,8/21/2017,5.0,We eat here at least once a month. Pazookies are hands down my favorite dessert item. It's worth coming to BJ'S just for the Pazookies. Pizza is also great deep dish.
Kali F.,Henderson  NV,123,23,4,9/3/2017,5.0,Delicious pazzokies  definitely recommend getting the sampler of 3 of them. Our server Julian was excellent and I will definitely be back!
Shawn J.,Henderson  NV,449,792,202,2/12/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I've been a fan of BJ's since I moved to Vegas  and the Henderson location in particular. There are a couple of things that keep me coming back. 1: Fast curbside pickup. Pull in  call the number on the sign  and they bring your food right to you. 2: Santa Fe Spring Rolls...YUM! 3: Avocado Egg Rolls are ordered every time  and are always good. 4: Mediterranean Pizza. It's a taste that's not for everyone but if you love Kalamata olives like I do  you know what you want and this is a good place to get it. Inside service can be hit or miss so we just order it to go so we can sit at home and watch Netflix without having to put up with a lot of extra noise  or watch a good game without sound which I don't like doing. 4 Stars...yeah  it's been awhile since I did my last review but 4 years later I'm still going back  and it's still good.
Jill M.,Las Vegas  NV,4,52,83,1/28/2017,5.0,Great atmosphere! The restaurant always keeps busy and has delicious food! I have never been disappointed with the food  service  or drinks. Ask for Dan! He is fun  friendly  and always good for a smile! Your whole family will love it. Don't forget to try the pizookie. My son's favorite is Oreo.
Kevin H.,Las Vegas  NV,25,16,30,3/17/2017,3.0,My family and I decided to visit Bj's instead of Cheese Cake factory. The server was amazing and on point. They've installed a new system that does not allow servers to create meals. In the past I've ordered a Patty melt with no problem. Today due to the new system it was not an option. I've ordered regular nachos as well...again not so able. My sister complained to the manager who was able to by pass the new computer system. While waiting for the food  runners came to the table with the wrong food. The runner apologized stating he read the ticket wrong. The waitresses seemed frustrated because the system is sub par. The food came with sides that were not requested. My wife ordered Chicken Parm with broccoli but instead got mash potatoes. The main meal came prior to the appetizer. The food tasted fair! Aside from the system and few hic-ups...not bad
Melissa S.,Las Vegas  NV,30,71,4,8/1/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Booooo went here today for a lunch meeting and my salad was gross! It was water logged and brown.. besides I asked for NO honey mustard on my salad and ranch instead... well when i started eating my salad they did the mistake of adding honey mustard and instead of making a new salad to correct their mistake they dosed it in ranch which made it even more soggy.. disappointed for sure!
Michelle M.,Henderson  NV,90,38,,7/25/2017,5.0,Always great food here. Sat at the bar a random afternoon to have a pizookie. The bartender woman Chris is awesome. Hard worker and great personality! She runs circles around the other girl! ...Love BJ's  it's always a great option when we are indecisive where to go!
Moses H.,Las Vegas  NV,182,326,312,1/27/2017,3.0,I had the black and blue burger with potatoe wedges. The wedges were crisp but void of seasoning. The burger was pretty standard and was kind of bland in regards to the Patty  but the bacon and cheese gave it some taste. Had the Brussel sprouts as an app which saved the meal as they were crisp and charred up perfectly. I had the house made root beer and that was super tasty as well so make sure and order one if your a soda fan. Service was great as was the ambiance of this joint. I will come back if just in the mood for apps and drinks.
Jacqui C.,Henderson  NV,53,168,115,3/19/2017,5.0,I've been to this place several times and would come back in the future. On one occasion  I celebrated my birthday here and they give you a cookie pie with a lit candle on top! The pie was delicious at best.Also  their burgers are huge but are very good! Sometimes  I had to take half of it home with me because it was too big for me to finish. The fries are pretty good too.
Brittany N.,Las Vegas  NV,143,120,268,10/6/2015,5.0,Goodness I love this place. It's a chain  but that doesn't mean it doesn't hold a special place in my heart. I can't get enough of the mocktails . They have a berry limeade cocktail that satisfies my need to have a unique refreshing drink. This drink has unlimited refills with fresh fruit in every glass. Bjs staff is always happy to serve you and never lets your glass stay empty. The food is always fresh and I'm currently craving their guacamole as I write this review. I have probably been to this establishment 10 different times  so I don't speak based on an antidote experience.My favorite dishes so far include the tomato soup in bread bowl  Cajon chicken pasta  and their golden beat salad.I'll be back during happy hour for their nut brown ale and discounted appetizers.:)
Sarah P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,63,73,3/25/2017,3.0,Very nice atmosphere and usually consistent food service. I ordered the New Orleans jambalaya and some mimosas. The first mimosa tastes more orange juice than champagne  but the second one was more equal parts  so a bit better. Its a good place to take friends and family because it's upscale casual and food and service is ok  but I don't go out of my way to have dinner there if I'm by myself.
Danielle G.,Henderson  NV,330,611,1678,11/10/2015,3.0,Not super impressed. I mean  it's a chain and a busy mix of families after soccer practice or a oddball mix of guys watching sports on TV. After about 15 minutes of waiting  our blinking remote went off and we were seated at a booth. About 5 minutes later our server arrives and takes drink orders  and returns 5 minutes later. We place our orders and about 15 minutes later the food arrives. Ordered; 2 kids sliders with fries  BBQ chicken salad  Dijon mustard chicken salad. Dessert was chocolate chip pizookie and Oreo pizookie. It was all okay  but just okay. Nothing wowed us. Our server was nice. Noise level was really high  but it's a sports bar place  so that's to be expected.
Walter M.,Henderson  NV,0,9,,8/9/2017,3.0,Excellent selection of beer. Fresh salmon is winner but  the menu is so extensive that it's average at everything else
Jessica M.,Las Vegas  NV,109,1,,8/8/2017,1.0,Bjs management sucks completely! Every location I have been to treat their staff poorly and it shows. I will NEVER be back at a Bjs location. EVER!
Edgar A.,Las Vegas  NV,0,19,1,11/21/2016,2.0,And to think I'm a large shareholder of this company.  California and Texas locations are perfect  but this particular one needs to get their 'ish' together. My waiter was cool  but my Mediterranean deep dish pizza was not cut properly and it was overcooked.  There were advertising on TV screens and on my table of a free pizookie if a mobile app was used  and my waiter was clueless when I asked. When it finally arrived  it was a very small size and burned!  Not going here again.
Denise W.,Santa Clara  CA,26,17,,7/17/2017,1.0,My son and I just arrived in town to visit family...daughter and grandsons. Went to BJs for an early dinner. I did not receive my dinner as ordered  strike one. My daughter tells me that this happens to her meals everytime they go to BJs. My dinner comes back the sauce was left off and minimal veggies are served  strike 2! Grandsons order a dessert each  the pizookie came before the rootbeer float. The pizookie was completely cooled and consumed and I had to ask about the float before it was served  STRIKE 3 and you are out. So would I go back to this BJs...not too sure about that...
John F.,Anthem  Las Vegas  NV,9,42,8,7/1/2017,5.0,Went in there a couple days ago with my wife and 2 boys. Nick was our server. This guy was OUTSTANDING very attentive and his suggestion were spot on. We go here about once a month but this is the first review I write for BJs because of Nick being a good guy and great server! Thank you for taking care of us we will be back. BBQ pizza is the best and Kids love the bazooka.
Melissa M.,Las Vegas  NV,442,226,98,7/5/2016,3.0,Came here for lunch on a Thursday and it's busy as hell. Not my first choice for lunch given the number of options around here. We came as a large group (20) for lunch. Given the number of us  service was decent  albeit food came slow.Food is mediocre. My tomato soups seemed more like spaghetti sauce. My pizza was okay and I enjoyed it again for dinner. The one thing I've found with BJs to be both its advantage and downfall is its large variety of a menu. Two things I can always count on are the beer and their pizookies. Also  their raspberry lemonade was pretty good too.My only other issue is the YELP check in coupon. The servers don't seem to know the details of this BOGO lunch. I was told I needed to sign up with their rewards program or something to get it. The fine print doesn't say anything of that sort on the coupon. Unfortunately I came into the restaurant ready to split costs with a coworker but they didn't honor it.
Ajay C.,Las Vegas  NV,68,54,65,6/1/2016,5.0,BJs restaurant and brewery puts a twist in your traditional bars and brewery's. They have specials and discounts on certain days of the week so make sure to ask or do your research. For Tuesday's  they have half off on wines and deep dish mini size pizzas. They also have their own crafted beers that can only be found at the restaurant. They have quite a few to choose from so it is sure to find one to your liking. They also have different entrees such as burgers  pastas  and more. They have an enlightened healthy menu for those who are on the healthy side. I strongly recommend trying some of their seasonal crafted beers.The athmosphere of place is very moderate  not too loud but not too quiet. There are televisions in about every corner for those who are here for sports. They also have an outside seating area which is perfect when the sun starts to set and the weather gets cool.They also have a dessert menu  try the pizzookie  a fresh baked cookie topped off with ice cream  it's delicious. They have a rewards program where you can earn points and use it on future eats. Enjoy!
Lisa N.,Las Vegas  NV,282,101,1731,10/15/2015,3.0,"Who loves BJ\'s ?? ok kids get your mind out of the gutter. Let\'s talk about the food.  They have a variety of food from burgers  pastas  salads and pizzas. I know they are popular for their pizzas  but it\'s too ""doughy"" for me. I guess similar to like a deep dish pizza  so when friends want to share a pizza I suggest the flatbread. I\'ve tried various dishes on their menu  even visited during happy hour  but the only dish that I enjoyed is their ahi tuna salad.   ok ... the REAL reason why I come to BJ\'s is when you have that craving for a warm cookie topped off with ice cream ... pizookie yuuummmm!! White macadamia used to be my favorite  but now they have salted caramel and I definitely won\'t choose any other.  Oh and if this place becomes a place you enjoy don\'t forget to ask for a BJ\'s card. COME to BJ\'s ... earn points (once again mind out of the gutter). This is cool because they send you offers periodically  and the points accumulate to free entrees or desserts."
Kari G.,Las Vegas  NV,0,16,7,6/6/2017,2.0,I've usually had good experiences w/BJ's - but recently each visit has been worse and worse. Last night was the topper making me log on and write this 2 star review. We ordered curbside to go b/c we wanted just an easy dinner. The curbside process was easy and fast which is the only reason for the extra star. However  the food last night was awful  and had I been dining in 2 of my 3 items ordered would have been sent back. We started with the potato crisp appetizer (basically potato skins). These aren't hard to mess up  but they were so burnt they were not even edible. Literally  fried to a crisp and I couldn't even eat it. Trash  $10.15 out the door - overpriced to begin with now that I'm thinking of it. My wife ordered sliders with cheese which we were charged $1.25 or something for cheese  which didn't get put on the burger. Since we paid already  nothing we can do. Stupid - I'm sure they do that on purpose to get more $ on to-go orders. Who's going to check for cheese in the car? I had some shrimp taco thing which was bland as can be. Literally no flavor...so I mean it was the only non-messed up item in our order but yuck. I had asked for sauce on the side  they put it right on the tacos  so actually 3/3 items messed up. I should be giving a 1-star but the gal who helped w/curbside was very nice. So many other places to eat - I said to my wife last night: OKAY - we're DONE with BJ's.
Mandisa B.,North Las Vegas  NV,121,34,54,10/18/2016,5.0,Great comfort food with a lot of healthy options as well. This establishment takes pride in having the best craft beer  make sure to sit at the bar to get the best service!
Rose P.,North Las Vegas  NV,19,71,27,4/30/2016,5.0,"Been here a handful of times and this review is way overdue! This place can get pretty crowded and busy at times. But you can\'t ding a restaurant just because of that... It means they\'re doing their job and running this place as it should! I have never had a complaint about getting greeted every time I walk into BJ\'s. When it\'s busy  they give us an honest estimate as to how long we will wait. None of that ""10 minutes"" when they really mean 45 minutes! Once we get seated our drink orders are taken almost instantly. We have quite some time to look over the menu  we never feel rushed. When you have no idea what to order waiters/waitresses are always recommending and suggesting things. Food comes out hot and fresh. You never have to wait too long for your food. Approximately between 30-45 minutes  max! I appreciate the waiters tending to our needs and frequently checking up on us. I never have complaints on cleanliness here. The waiting area  seating area  and bathrooms are always so clean! HUGE plus for me! Excellent customer service! Welcoming and accommodating staff. I would highly recommend this place! Side note  if you don\'t know what to order I would suggest: Appetizers- avocado egg rolls  stuffed mushroomsMain Dish- Cajun chicken pasta  (any flavor) deep dish pizza  or broccoli cheddar soup and/or clam chowder with a bread bowlDessert- you can never go wrong with a pizookie! But definitely try the beignet! Hope this helps!"
Andrew I.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,8,49,18,12/7/2016,5.0,Comfortable and stress-free bar to sit at for a quick bite and watch sports. Attentive service staff. Love the ambiance  low key and conversational.
Ryan C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,2,5/12/2017,1.0,"Took a group of people there for lunch. One of the wedge salads came out frozen  not sure how that is even possible if it is fresh and had just been plated. Ordered the Avacado Egg Rolls as an appetizer and found a ""Grown in California"" sticker in one of them. I guess we know where they get the Avacodos from... I know there were 11 people so a lot to coordinate  but the meals did not come out together and some were cold so I think there was a bit of mis-timing in preparing them."
Brent L.,Las Vegas  NV,0,15,4,7/19/2017,5.0,This was our first time at this location but second time at a BJ's Brewhouse. We went for an early supper  around 4pm so it wasn't busy. Our server was very polite and professional. Our food was great and the beer is superb. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo and my garlic knot didn't come with it. Server said they were waiting on them. No big deal. A few minutes later  the manager comes over and apologized for the wait. Then instead of the one that comes with the meal  they give me three. Our second trip to a Brewhouse  our second great experience!!
Liz S.,Henderson  NV,13,6,,7/26/2017,4.0,Thanks for the fast  friendly service - clean and my table was bussed promptly. You're not sitting there having coffee after your meal staring at your lunch dishes on your table. Otherwise  it's your typical BJs.
Linda M.,Henderson  NV,21,470,665,10/8/2016,5.0,From calling in the order  the packaging of the food to the quality of food our overall experience was excellent. We ordered fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and corn  chicken tortilla soup and santa fe salad. Everything was delicious. The packaging was done right with tight lids and cold food separated in another bag from the hot food. I can't tell you what a pleasure it was to get our food home without worrying about any spills! The bags of food could have been tipped over and nothing would have spilled. I order a lot of takeout and this restaurant is now on the top of my list.
Mazlina B.,Las Vegas  NV,64,16,33,10/29/2016,5.0,My fav place with family & friends  dates with my husband  & happy hour with teacher colleagues. Always fun  clean  pleasant  courteous  & enjoyable.
Tomica B.,Powder Springs  GA,7,21,,6/25/2017,1.0,Nope  not a fan of this pizza at all. It was not only expensive  but VERY disappointing. I live out of town  so I'm pretty certain that I will never eat here again.
Coco R.,Henderson  NV,313,10,2,3/3/2017,5.0,An amazing restaurant for any occasion!!! So many food options (all great  but I have my favorites!)  many drink options  and comfortable atmosphere! I've been here many times for birthdays  celebrations  meetings  and just for lunch!Prices vary  you can spend a lot or can find something for cheap! ($15-) Tonight I was there with my best friend for her birthday and our waiter  Brandon  took so much care of us! Birthday pizookie (specialty cookie/brownie desert) & free drink Brandon  you rock!
Melony S.,Lake Forest  CA,101,10,5,4/28/2017,4.0,This is my go-to place to order curbside pickup on nights when I want good food  but don't want to cook. Good pricing and the convenience of pickup.
Bob S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,11/14/2017,1.0,"Kevin Morrison - Manager of BJ\'s in Henderson is a moron. I have eaten at the this restaurant about 150 times in three years. It\'s a fast fix to mediocre food at cheap corporate prices when you have a busy business schedule like myself-a step above Burger King  McDonalds and other fast food chains. Basically this is corporate America - hiring idiots who can\'t deliver simple requests like a decent salad that doesn\'t look like a small Hamster portion with shredded and soggy lettuce and chopped tomato! Looks like one of those prepackaged salads at McDonalds. Sorry  I requested actual sliced tomato  avocado and red onion and real lettuce but the dumb server screwed it up. Let alone I order a charbroiled steak (not fried) and they only charbroiled one side with that facing up (as if I would\'nt notice). When I sent back the salad without eating it this manager - a little ""piss ant"" bald jerk comes running out and tells me to leave the restaurant and not come back! About a month before that the lot was entirely full without one space so I parked my car in the take out area and this little creep Morrison comes running up to the bar threatening to tow me! When I complained to Corporate Management they actually defended him! It must be difficult to find decent employees with the crappy wages they pay. So much for getting repeat business - they could care less. Better to hire twenty bad employees and pay them crap than hire five good ones and pay them fairly. That\'s why their turnover is so high. Steer clear of this place is my advice."
Mr Photo Mtb F.,Las Vegas  NV,6,94,33,7/12/2017,4.0,Today I had the kale salad it was excellent that's probably the best salad that they have and get it with the blackened shrimp good stuff and great service
Arthur M.,Henderson  NV,103,451,1748,8/27/2015,4.0,BJ's is one of our options when the whole family goes out for dinner. They have the seating and are usually staffed to handle larger parties. The restaurant is spacious with plenty of televisions so you can take a peek at your favorite game. Their menu is huge and everyone can find something to eat. But there's only a handful of items that I personally would consistently order though.For me  of course I'm a fan of their craft beer. They have a nice selection that runs the spectrum of flavors with the Jeremiah Red and PM Porter being my favorites. You can order a flight if you're having trouble deciding or want to try multiple beers. Their deep dish pizza with the thick  crunchy  and slightly greasy crust has always been pretty consistent. The Pizookies are a must order. A warm cookie with ice cream is a slam dunk.On our most recent visit  I decided to go with the 14 oz. ribeye ($21.50) with brussel sprouts and asparagus. I wouldn't order this again  nor would I recommend it. It wasn't terrible  but for the price  I can get a better  larger steak from the butcher. The brussel sprouts were mush and I couldn't finish them. We finished with the salted caramel pizookie which was delicious and completely annihilated.I made the mistake this visit by going away from one of my staples  but I wouldn't think twice about coming back for drinks at the bar or bringing the group for a meal.
Alex N.,Las Vegas  NV,100,118,120,2/13/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,The fact that I'm here all the time makes it a shame that I had it at four stars. This is my favorite place to be. The food and the beer are always great. All the bartenders are awesome. They're personable  engaging  and don't make you wait for a beer. My tastes have changed in that I pretty much always get the barbacoa chicken  double chicken  now. The seasonal beers always keep the selection fresh. Sweet sin chocolate ale?! This place is amazing to me.
Diane M.,Las Vegas  NV,203,179,1418,4/9/2015,3.0,First of all the BJ's Mobile App is a good tool to have if you plan on dining here. You can add yourself to the waitlist  order ahead for dine in or take out  see your rewards points  and actually pay on the app. Being able to add yourself to the waitlist before you get there comes in handy since there seems to be a perpetual wait at the Eastern location.  This review is for our last two visits because they were so close together. Both times we were seated within a couple of minutes because we used the app waitlist and on both occasions we had good service and flavorful food and libations. However the comfort level of their seating varies greatly depending on where you are seated. The larger booths are roomy  but the smaller 2 person booths don't have enough space  especially if you order a pizza that takes up most of the table. I wish they would only use these tables if they don't have any other open spaces.Beverages: LightSwitch Lager (4/5) & Top Shelf Margarita (3/5)Appetizer: Crispy Fried Artichokes with lemon garlic aioli (4/5) and House Salad (3/5)Pizza: Vegetarian Signature Deep Dish (mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  onions  seasoned tomatoes) 4/5Sandwich: Roast Beef Dip (5/5)Burger: Crispy Jalapeno (4/4)
Josephine L.,Fowler  CA,0,4,,6/24/2017,5.0,Try the spinach stuffed mushrooms! They are to die for. Even better  Roy was an amazing bartender. I'll definitely be coming back again soon!
Nicole F.,Las Vegas  NV,113,334,1415,10/31/2016,4.0,Ordered the soup an salad for lunch and wow it was good. Haven't been to Bj's in forever  guess I'll be coming back. So surprised how cheap our total was plus the server was amazing !
Susan S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,13,,6/19/2017,2.0,The waiter (Carlos) was hovering over my table with a check  pressuring me to leave so he could seat more people. He was very flirty and made me feel a little uncomfortable. You are there to WORK  not use BJ's as a dating service. I will probably not be back. I said something to a female hostess and she acted like it was normal and didnt seem to care. Very disappointed. The food was good  service poor.
Laura O.,Las Vegas  NV,109,31,40,7/31/2016,3.0,Even though the fine print on my coupon says I get a free appetizer if my check is $9.95 or higher my waiter stated that my personal total needed to be that high  not me and my boyfriends together. Which is insane. Obviously we are going to share the appetizer - just like we are going to share the check. He went in the back to check with the manager and came out less then a minute later with the same answer. Funny how the management/the waiter contradict the fine print in the coupon that Yelp puts out (that's right  I got the coupon from Yelp!)So whatever  we will have some happy hour and go home. Really the only person that suffers is the waiter. We tip on what the bill would have been BEFORE discounts. Duh.
Alice C.,Las Vegas  NV,798,180,1515,2/27/2015,3.0,I came to BJ's for a beer tasting dinner. I like the ambiance here; clean  dimly lit  gorgeous big booths for seating and high ceilings. I had a blast at the beer tasting and enjoyed trying a variety of IPAs! The experience was awesome... the host walked us through the history and type of each beer we tasted and we also were served a course of several small dishes. They poured generous samples of each beer and filled us back up if we requested. I was a little buzzed by the end  but that was expected  right?I've been here a few times since then for drinks and have tried their pizzas and some appetizers. The food isn't anything to rave about and they are known for their pizzas but I've tried much better. The service is always good  can't complain there. I don't come back too often but I would definitely sign up for their next beer tasting dinner!
Kat K.,Las Vegas  NV,4,37,29,3/5/2017,1.0,"Party of 2  seated right away (not packed or busy). Server wasn\'t very helpful while ordering however our order was placed fairly quickly. Crispy fried shrimp and a ribeye dinner. Waited 20 minutes for a side salad and another 10 for dressing. Waited about 45 minutes for our food. The food was extremely hot from sitting under the heat lamps for so long which made the ""crispy fried shrimp"" taste rubbery. Asked for a refill on drinks when the food arrived (45 minute wait for a refill). Sent the shrimp back  took a box to go for the steak. Ended up paying $40 to watch my husband eat his dinner. Server didn\'t seem to care about the service or customer satisfaction and experience. Will never visit this location again. Waste of money."
Justin C.,Las Vegas  NV,29,20,19,5/19/2017,3.0,3 stars is only cause we went on Friday night. Now why does Friday nights suck...well happy hour does not come back at 10 pm like Sunday thru Thursday and Friday night has no dinner specials. So skip Friday nights unless you just love full price drinks and dinner.
Blake K.,Henderson  NV,66,65,7,9/7/2016,4.0,I had a deep dish Ravioli and it was excellent. Service was decent except for the hostesses who were a bit rude. Other than that  I had a very enjoyable dinner. Very nice restaurant in an upscale area.
Rachel B.,Las Vegas  NV,487,141,555,1/7/2015,1.0,"We came to BJs this evening for happy hour and we unfortunately had to sit next to an inebriated man. We asked the bartender Scott at what point they stop serving him and the bartender said ""when he\'s drunk"" and I said ""you don\'t think he\'s drunk?"" We got the manager involved as this guy was touching me and making a scene and i felt it was handled very poorly. The manager just made him slide down and kept saying ""I have to slide down for the fat and ugly girl."" This guy was clearly over served and they let him remain at the bar and continued to make a scene.I absolutely will not be back to this location due to the way this situation has been handled.I am expecting a response and would look into your bartenders over serving your guests as that is definitely a liability."
Jeff F.,Henderson  NV,0,50,14,11/2/2016,4.0,I had a brew house blonde beer and it was very good. It was very tasty yet still on the lighter side. I also had the seared Tuna salad and it wasVERY good. The food was very good and served very quickly. This is a great place
Marlyn V.,Las Vegas  NV,177,29,195,2/9/2017,5.0,Came here after 230p and was seated by the best server ever Davena and she went above and beyond our expectations. It's because of her that I will be back. She only works during the day so come here for lunch on Thursdays for their Baby Back Rib Thursdays. It's totally worth it. And their clam chowder is one of the most tastiest I've ever had.
Dennis D.,Henderson  NV,292,253,1452,12/21/2014,3.0,BTW  for those who care  this is my 100th review!!! Woot woot! Anyways  I Went here for dinner with some friends because one of them never had a pizookie and I just couldn't let that go on for any longer. Nothing too special about this place  but it is known for their pizzas. I ended up ordering the chicken limon pasta which was really good  but that could be because I was super hungry at that time. The pasta was filling  but it was also really buttery and oily. I don't eat that heathy  but it'd be nice if the fatty stuff wasn't just straight up obvious because it can be off putting at times. On the bright side  the two sticks of garlic bread they gave was pretty good and was a nice compliment to the dish.My friends and I got the strawberry beignet and the pizookie trio (white chocolate macadamia  Oreo  and chocolate chip) for dessert. The beignet was pretty crispy which is a big plus and the scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberry pieces made it even better.  I also discovered my newfound appreciation of the Oreo pizookie. If you haven't yet  you have to try it out when you get the chance. Just be aware that the portion sizes for each of the trio is pretty small so it would be a nice small dessert for 3 people to split. This place is a little overpriced in terms of the food and portion size  so just be aware of that.
Samantha C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,5,5/18/2017,5.0,Great service  Bill the bartender makes a mean drink and is friendly  but not annoying  while we sat for a couple of hours. Good beer too!
Naomi N.,Las Vegas  NV,536,244,1691,1/29/2015,4.0,LOVE THE BLONDE BEERHad to grab a quick pazookie trio here after dinner.The place was packed for a thursday night there seemed to be a little wait.We sat at the bar & we were greeted very quickly by the bartender .... we knew what we wanted & ordered right away. I personally can't drink very much & they had a little 5oz. Beer that they sell too! It's so cute and the perfect amount for me. Got the blonde beer & it was delish.Had to give a 4 star on this review because the pazookie cookie was not hot. Maybe they changed it or something but it used to come out hot to the point where u can't really touch the silver tin part  but the tin wasn't even very warm. That was the only thing a little disappointing since I took a friend to try the restaurant for the first time.Other than that great service! =]
Miber J.,Henderson  NV,35,73,30,9/5/2016,3.0,My iced coffee was weird  it was like watered down regular coffee over ice. I would never order it again. For a sports bar there were an awfull lot of children there! Although our food was quite delicious tho mmm especially dessert. Our server was attentive and friendly  the menu was so vast  it takes a while to decide. Our overall experience was good its just that at the end of the day  its just over priced bar food in a noisy environment.
Tania S.,Albuquerque  NM,213,612,1464,4/20/2015,4.0,Nick did a great job getting our orders and drinks quickly. We had an eventful night on the Strip and wanted to chill out for a late dinner out in Henderson. BJ's was a great choice! All the food was so good!Between three of us gals  we ordered some beverages followed by a Pulled Pork sandwich  Hamburger with Wedge fries  then my (pictured) Swiss Cheeseburger with Skinny fries. With room for dessert  we ordered the Chocolate Chip Pizookie  which is a must if you eat here!Over a nice dinner and cool conversation  I can't think of a better place to hang after a typical Vegas night. Great drinks  even better atmosphere  and awesome server! When I'm back in town  I'll be sure to check it out again (aka more Pizookies). :-)
Cindy W.,Las Vegas  NV,16,312,2,3/5/2017,3.0,BJs is an average chain restaurant. My spaghetti & meatballs were fairly good although a bit pricey ($15). It was dark in there & I really couldn't read the menu or see the pictures well. It looked like it said $11 for the spaghetti. My friend's spinach salad looked good.
Chad F.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,1,4,,4/5/2017,5.0,Thank you BJ's for keeping your entire restaurant open during the hours posted on your door. Your neighbors (twin nasty peaks) closes their kitchen an hour before they close the actual restaurant. Makes no sense...but thank you for the great food and service at 11:30pm.
Kashaundra W.,Henderson  NV,0,11,12,4/22/2017,3.0,"Let me start with I was on a much needed date night with my hubby while the kids greyed grandmas hair for the weekend. We were seated at a greasy table top and the seat cushions had grease and food particles on it. Not good and I\'m wearing all white! I only rate with three stars because of the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant. The food drinks and service was great! But back to my issue  I don\'t know how well they clean and sanitize their cloth napkins that the silverware is wrapped in and we use on our face (the corner of your mouth) but for the sake of the community\'s health  I hope very well! I found five cloth napkins in total on the floor under my table and the surrounding tables ( I counted on my way to the restroom).... I noticed a little extra cushion under my stiletto and my husband stepped on something that poked the bottom of his shoe and that\'s when he noticed a couple of forks under our table as well. This is when I began to look around and noticed more than I wanted to. Upon picking up the napkins I saw silverware and trash at all of the surrounding booths! We brought it to our waiters attention and he was highly disappointed.As we finished our meal a bus boy came by to ""clean"" the booth next to ours and we understood! He spent five seconds (literally) wiping down the table with a dirty damp cloth and did a quick swiffer wipe on one seat cushion and neglected the other! He didn\'t bother to look under the table or properly wipe down the entire seating area... it was a total hit and miss. All in all the food  drinks and service are always great but the cleanliness gets worse with each visit...."
Stan P.,Las Vegas  NV,15,95,18,2/15/2017,4.0,New to Vegas recommended by a local friend was pleasantly surprised! We will definitely come back to this place as a repeat customer.
Sheila M.,Henderson  NV,85,22,3,3/6/2017,5.0,Great service and great food! Gotta love a server who continues to refill your glass when you've ordered a pitcher. Have never had a bad experience coming here.
Zachary A.,Las Vegas  NV,66,693,,1/9/2016,3.0,This review is for 3.5 stars.Overall  I enjoyed my trip to BJ's. I came for the brew but also tried some food which was solid. Their beer is surprisingly unique and flavorful for a chain microbrewery. I had the 4 beer sampler for a little under $7 and also was able to sample other brews because the bartender was gracious. All of the ales (pale  IPA  DIPA) were nice and a less hoppy variant of the style. The Porter had a solid chocolate taste and the imperial stout was very smooth for the 8+ ABV. As far as food  I had a quinoa salad which was not overly memorable  but was good enough for a meal. There are 3 BJ's within the Las Vegas area  so wherever you are in town  you are bound to be near one. If you are looking for a solid  not macro brew  come here. They also offer very good guest taps and bottles for very reasonable prices ($5-6.50) when it comes to Las Vegas. The Happy Hour for beer is $1.00 off draft and there are also some food deals. I recommend you give BJ's a try.
J. R. S.,San Diego  CA,7,27,6,3/14/2017,5.0,Good selection of food. There was something for everyone. All of our food was well prepared and great tasting. Our server was Amy C. and she was one of the best servers I've ever had. Very friendly and attentive. She constantly asked if we needed something before I ever had a chance to flag her down. We will come back!
Allison M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,23,11,2/22/2017,3.0,Bjs has always been one of my favorite places. On valentine's day my husband and i came here for a quick bite to eat because he had to work. We were notified they no longer had the crispy thin fries. Appalled  but decided to give the new ones a chance. I HATED THEM. lacking flavor and to be honest i'd rather have their cold thin fries over these any day. They definitely will be losing our weekly or even bi weekly visits. Up the price if you're losing money  but don't change something so good.
Alissa S.,Mission Viejo  CA,3,22,7,5/16/2016,5.0,Food was good  service was great!Brandon has a big booty PHAT if y'all know what I mean.No but really..This location is slightly off the strip in a great location. Happy hour is murder! It took everything I had to reject one of their amazing looking cocktails. I will be back to try each margarita on that cocktail list! Mark my words =]Brandon was adorable  helpful  patient and very attentive. Even with a full row of bar booths. From one industry person to another. Well done Hun.
Nick C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,2,9/17/2016,5.0,At bj's really good service our server was really will definitely recommended my wife a drink that she just got and we'll see how the drinks are and so far so good
N M.,Henderson  NV,24,12,4,12/3/2016,1.0,Hostesses did not put our name on the list after doing the preferred VIP Checkin. Kenneth was great in his service but the hostesses are worthless pieces of human organisms. Does a disservice to the waitstaff.  Food was consistent and good as usual. Unfortunately for the waitstaff  this is the last time we are dining at this chain.
Vegas N.,Henderson  NV,1,41,7,1/27/2017,4.0,I go here when the wife is out of town. She goes with me many times  especially when a big game is one that we want to see. We always sit at the bar. The service is very good  sometimes it might take longer to get our food  but nothing outrageous. The beers are very good  the home make sodas are tasty. The cherry chipoltle salmon is exceptional. A nice sized salmon filet sitting on a field of cous cous and grilled asparagus. The calories and fat are very low. We love the happy hour pizzas. Nice price and very good quality. We are usually not fans of national chains such as B.J.'s. But  the menu is extremely broad with multiple healthy choices and the prices are reasonable for what they deliver.And  in other B.J.'s across the nation that we have visited  the quality is surprisingly similar.
Kirsten M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,24,3,2/28/2017,5.0,I love BJ's there is so much on the menu to pick from. I have been to two of their locations and every time  the staff is so friendly  the portions are big and the price is right. The honey sriracha brussel sprouts are AMAZING! Great place to go with your significant other or even a big group!
Elena L.,Las Vegas  NV,65,33,17,6/15/2016,3.0,Clam chowder is kinda salty  service was alright but the hostesses seemed off  boyfriend thought the chicken alfredo was good but I thought it was pretty average. Eh?
Sandra M.,Fisherman's Wharf  San Francisco  CA,0,13,,1/12/2017,2.0,The chicken tastes like rubber. It's not just this location. Their food aside from the pizza has just really gone down hill. My husband and I shared the Santa Fe salad and the Alfredo chicken pasta. Both plates had gross chicken. The salad was bearable at best. The pasta I sent back because I asked for the chicken well done and it wasn't at all. It was rubbery and veiny. When they brought it back they chopped up the same chicken and tossed more sauce on it. Annoying but not worth the battle obviously. I ate around it. The service was good. I just won't be back because of the food. I haven't had good food here in a while.
Melody W.,Las Vegas  NV,4,22,,4/20/2016,5.0,Nice neighborhood restaurant /bar. Like an upscale version of Applebee's / Benigans.Food is great my family's favorites are the jambalaya  fried chicken breast  barbecue ranch chopped salad. I haven't tried the pizza yet but they sure look yummy. My favorite soup is chicken tortilla soup. Crafted beer and soda are also wonderful.
Jonathan W.,Las Vegas  NV,244,41,25,3/2/2017,5.0,I used to work here and I have to say  for that year that I was employed.. I could've turned into an avocado egg roll I ate SK many of them!! So good! Really awesome spot for a date  which is what I was doing the first time I ever went there  or a big family dinner. The food is some of the best I've had in Vegas!! Get the root beer! I promise it'll change your life. =P
Kelsey S.,Henderson  NV,78,64,94,5/10/2016,5.0,They recently updated their lunch menu only available Monday through Friday and it's so good! I ordered the chicken bacon ranch and meat lovers piadina and it's literally the best thing I've ever had here. It's like the fancy version of a hot pocket. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and I will definitely order it again. For drinks  we ordered the hand crafted margarita and the harvest peach margarita. The bar tender was not shy when pouring the margaritas  which made very happy. The peach margarita is seasonal and was my favorite of the two. If you're old enough  I recommend sitting at the bar - you're right in front of the TVs playing a variety if sports channels and have easy access to alcohol!
Ralph P.,Las Vegas  NV,6,51,97,8/2/2016,4.0,Bjs in Henderson is right near the 215. The Santa fe salad is awesome. The chips add a crunch to the old that makes it super good. I had to take a break from shoveling the entire thing in my face. It's huge  so be prepared.
Emily P.,Las Vegas  NV,144,70,24,3/14/2016,5.0,I must say... BJ's has turned it around! There was a time where we couldn't seem to get the correct food or something yummy looking. However  we started seeing a different group of guys working the bar and times have times!! Yummy food  happy and friendly service  and always great beer choices.PS.. Happy hour goes until 7!!!!
Denise M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,7/3/2017,1.0,After dining in many times and ordering the kale and Brussels sprouts salad  I ordered the allegedly same salad  'to go.' It was terrible...barely filled the container and was missing some of the usual ingredients. I think I found two blueberries and three pecans. Terrible!
Kurt S.,Las Vegas  NV,3,17,3,12/5/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Just doesn't seem as good as it used to. Menu has gotten smaller  starchier  and less interesting. The cooking seems sporadic -- Just not as well prepared and consistent as a few years ago. Things often come out undercooked  burnt  and sloppy. The ingredients don't seem as fresh. They no longer seem to carry the seasonal Goliath and Imperial IPA beers we liked. We still go here now and then  but a lot less often. I hope they will turn this around and return to the consistency and quality they had a few years ago.
Tamara S.,Henderson  NV,38,50,7,11/21/2016,5.0,Fianc and I come here often. We each order something often. Let's start off with the food  the avocado egg rolls are superior   stuffed mushrooms are delicious  chicken tortilla soup looks small but is actually really filling  &parmesan garlic wings are a must. The waiters/ waitresses are extremely accommodating. And the plus is the food isn't that expensive  nor the drinks :)
Ashley C.,Henderson  NV,56,274,157,4/25/2016,5.0,First time ever going to this place  honestly never heard of them. We decided to go for brunch which is on the weekend (Saturday's and Sunday's) I was excited to see breakfast menu. I got me OJ  French toast with eggs and bacon. Really good! My husband had the classic burger with their secrecy sauce and potato wedges. He even said the lemonade was delicious. We liked this place we ate it again in CA. Great food and our waitress and hostess were really nice :)
Aurora D.,Las Vegas  NV,304,272,242,8/4/2015,4.0,Went here for lunch and was impressed with how they kept everything moving during this busy hour. I had the Salmon Quinoa bowl (lunch menu) and it was the perfect size. I asked for the [Ginger Soy] sauce on the side and I'm glad I did  otherwise I think it may have been too salty. The service was great for us as well. Next time I want to try one of their many pizookies!!I don't know that it stands out too much (beside the pizookies) from other bar-restaurant chains but if you need a good solid place to go for different palates  this Eastern location can do the trick.
Candice S.,Las Vegas  NV,1,119,69,7/7/2015,2.0,I try not to go to chain restaurants as much as possible for a reason! BJ's reminded me of exactly why. We walked in and were seated right away because it was empty  however  waited 15 minutes for a server to ask us what we wanted to drink. Waited another 10 for our waters and to order... Waited another 30 for our dinners... Our server seemed over worked and unapologetic. The food was average. Deep dish ravioli was good pepperoni pizza was ok the roast beef dip was dry  chicken Alfredo was dry... Just overall a bad experience...so THANK YOU BJ's for reminding me of why we don't do chain restaurants.
Jim T.,Las Vegas  NV,85,270,148,5/4/2016,5.0,Their pizzas are amazing  love the deep dish pizza. They also have thin and flatbread. They have a good selection of their own craft beers but the Pazooky is the bomb.  Thank you BJ's for appreciating teachers  truly appreciate it!!!!!
Mollie E.,Las Vegas  NV,56,34,1,10/21/2016,4.0,Fantastic service from Felicia. Went during the weekday at lunch and was in and out quickly. She was the perfect amount of helpful without being overbearing. I love BJs
Joann B.,Henderson  NV,34,5,1,12/16/2016,5.0,Mediterranean tacos are to die for!! Great service  exceptional food. Server Christina was awesome!
Danielle M.,Escondido  CA,3,51,9,11/2/2016,5.0,We had our rehearsal dinner here  and it was perfect! The staff were very attentive  and quickly got our drinks and food just kept coming. Also  Joe the manager that took care of us was AWESOME! He was very professional and took really good care of us from start to finish.
Stan C.,Henderson  NV,131,366,196,6/18/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"I have eaten at BJ\'s many times. Mostly I\'ve been here for dinner and once for brunch. This was the first time I came here for lunch. I chose the seared ahi salad off of their lunch menu. The salad was listed as having only 540 calories which made it very attractive in regards to being diet compliant. The salad was quite large in size. It had a lot of what I would call ""foo foo"" lettuce. But it also had avocado  tomato  and other tasty add ins ( including a small dollop of wasabi on each side of the plate). In addition there was a fairly generous amount ahi tuna. Overall  a relatively healthy  fairly dietetic  enjoyable luncheon salad. Combine that with pleasant ambience and excellent service (kudos to Shenna). A good choice for a midweek lunch."
Alisa P.,Miami  FL,0,14,5,6/5/2017,5.0,Gianna had great service and served us with extreme happiness. Glad to have her bring us our food each time(:
mark k.,Lakewood  CA,1,19,,4/28/2017,4.0,BJs is usually a weekly stop for me. Enjoy the atmosphere and the food is always good. I am a beer guy and I love their beers  but at $6 a pop the bill stacks up quick. They currently have specials for each day of the work week minus Friday. Monday is 1/2 off pizza  which if you like deep dish pizza is a fabulous deal  and Wednesday is $4 beer day another good deal. All in all this place is consistent and I will continue to frequent it.
Beth C.,Henderson  NV,9,9,,11/10/2016,3.0,Food is nothing to write home about and the service was horrible. With all the great places to eat here in Vegas and Henderson you would think they would be better. Will not go back.
Cecellia M.,North Las Vegas  NV,170,5,1,11/27/2016,5.0,Been coming here for 3 years now and the food is always amazing  service is great  and I leave feeling fat and happy. Never fails to satisfy.
Ronald M.,Henderson  NV,29,35,80,6/16/2016,5.0,Wait staff is always pleasant and the food is consistently great. Full bar and reasonable prices.
Nicholas D.,Las Vegas  NV,280,25,,11/23/2016,5.0,I will usually go here on my lunch break and they staff never fail to get me out in perfect timing. I usually just sit at the bar and I have to say the lady bartender is without a doubt the best server/bartender that you could ask for. She is friendly  cheerful and just has the perfect personality. I have never had an issue with the food nor the service at this locations  so I recommend BJ's to most of my friends.
Jason R.,Brooklin Paulista  Brazil,187,170,232,5/20/2015,3.0,My vote for best late-night beer in Henderson. Great atmosphere and super-friendly service  extensive bar selection. The sticking point is the menu. Food here is over-engineered and ok quality. I'd love to see BJ's throw out the menu and do fewer traditional bar & grill items better.
Judge X.,Las Vegas  NV,0,31,2,4/19/2016,5.0,This bj's has become a late night stop for us  and Rachel in the bar area always makes our experience here great. She remembers everything we drink and eat  and even the modifications. She's very attentive  always asks how we are doing  and takes great care of us...it's nice to feel like you are welcome and wanted. So I only feel right giving her a 5star review. However be warned  on Sunday night there is a snarky older lady with short hair  in the bar area that makes you feel unwanted and like you are wasting her time  she walks away while you are talking to her as if she cutting you off and interrupts you as if she needs you to hurry up  on everything. We have tried to give her the benefit of the doubt a couple times but now  we just avoid going on Sunday nights.
Kellene M.,Henderson  NV,2,12,9,10/16/2016,5.0,Great place to relax and watch football. The Bloody Mary's are super delicious! Roy is a great bartender and goes the extra mile to remember orders of the regulars. He makes our dining experience very pleasant.
Mary R.,Las Vegas  NV,212,91,73,1/28/2016,5.0,Wow! Came here on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm. Place was full but no waiting! Our waitress was friendly and kind. I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and my friend ordered Jambalaya. Food got.to our table in less than 10 minutes. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked. Although we were full  we couldn't leave without trying the baked beignet.
Stephanie P.,Henderson  NV,87,132,55,1/3/2015,3.0,"My Dad recently moved into a new place. After a full day of my sister and I helping to get him settled in  we decided a nice warm meal was needed on this very  very cold day (last weekend).I decided to go ""old school"" with the chicken tenders served with skinny fries and a strawberry lemonade. Dad had the roast beef with au jus  and my sister went for a burger.The chicken tenders were tender with a generous amount of breading. The strawberry lemonade was unfortunately just too sweet. The fries were cooked perfectly! All in all  not bad."
Mel D.,Henderson  NV,10,12,8,4/7/2016,4.0,Best food and service!!!! I sat at the bar and at a Deep Dish Favorite (mini) and got another once to go to eat the next day for lunch. The trio Pizzokie was super yummy as well. Because I started with the mozzarella and tomato salad (ate it all)  then ate favorite mini pizza and ended with trio Pizzokie  I was more than full. I washed it all down with a Blonde. Incredible food  prompt and courteous service  definitely worth it.
Veron S.,San Diego  CA,114,21,4,10/5/2016,1.0,Place an order of rib eye dinner & salmon dinner came up to about $50 . The meats where under cooked & I complain to the manager Kevin he gave me the run around then says I can only give you a $25 gift card . Horrible customer service & serves people under cooked nasty food . They don't care !!!
Amy R.,Depew  NY,152,43,19,9/11/2016,3.0,Went here for the first time Friday night for drinks and appetizers. Our server was great. I ordered a glass of Chianti and choked on the first sip. It had turned; restaurants need to do a better job of keeping track of when their red wine bottles are open. I ordered a porter instead and that was much better. We had 2 apps and the srirachi honey glazed Brussels sprouts were awesome! The ambience was good for a larger restaurant. I would come back again.
Linda C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,11/6/2016,5.0,I wanted to take my elderly aunt out for lunch today. Since she requires a wheelchair  I need help with that. We decided to call BJ'S and ask if they would assist us if we came by. They couldn't have been more helpful. The manager had a young man named Carlos come out and assist with the wheelchair. We had a wonderful lunch. My aunt had the chicken Alfredo pasta and I had the half California club flatbread pizza and salad. All were tasty and enough to bring home extra! Oh  we had the yummy appetizer  fried artichoke too! Thanks BJ'S You made my aunt happy and that makes me happy! We will be back.
Cindy W.,Royse City  TX,8,199,59,2/3/2016,4.0,I came here with the family to support a school fundraiser. I had never been here so I was looking forward to it. We were seated right away and our server was pleasant. Food was better than Applebee's  and the portions were huge! For a family of 5  it was around $50  and that included the very affordable kid sized sundaes for my boys. Love that they made the desert affordable since my kids are usually still hungry after meals and ask for desert but then take two bites. Such a waste of money! Great atmosphere  nice and spacious. We will be back!
Jennel G.,Las Vegas  NV,316,85,7,3/22/2016,3.0,Kiddos to me server Kris  she made this experience bearable! Came in starving  only to find out Bjs has changed their portions on the salmon. Lunch is now  an appetizer :-(. It was Dry and salty Next time I want to leave hungry  I'll come for lunch
Kurt G.,Denver  CO,192,225,108,11/24/2014,2.0,So I'm not one to call anyone out so I won't. .. But the two star review is due to service I had both times here from the same server. Not horrible  just unfriendly and not very attentive (at one point we went to the bar to get refills). Maybe it's because we were sitting on the patio. Food here is good  nice selection  and i enjoy the in house made beers  but just kind of got the impression my being there was an inconvenience to the server. Solid three stars if not for the service. Womp womp.
Mark H.,Honolulu  HI,1173,309,189,9/27/2013,4.0,I came here following the recommendation of the sales rep at the Bells outlet mall. It was a good distance away from the Strip  out in Henderson--possibly a 15 - 20 minute drive.We sat on the bar for quicker service. We had the pleasure of having Emily serve us. Emily was fantastic--very helpful  outgoing  and offering valuable recommendations. Not to mention she is a cutie! =DOf course when in Vegas  I am always drinking. And dinner here was no different. My buddy chose the 4 beer sampler while I opted for the 8 beer version. The 8 beer sampler totaled 40oz. Not bad for a sampler! And only about $12.xx to boot! Beers were of your more obscure  microbrewery variety and all sooo good. Got a diverse range of flavors and colors of beer.Not knowing what to eat (menu is quite extensive)  we chose the thai chicken wonton based on its picture in the menu. Tapa sized portions which worked out fine since I didn't want to get stuffed off an appetizer. The wonton texture was crispy and flaky. The accompanying thai sauce was a bit strong on the fish sauce--use in moderation. Good consistency of sauce--don't like watery sauce softening the wrappings of my wontons... It was good  but I wouldn't make a strong recommendation on it. If you are in the mood for this  then order; otherwise  not a must have.My buddy ordered the deep dish pizza. Not sure what was the name of the specialty pizza but he ordered the meaty version. He liked it  but I'm a pickier eater. I thought the pizza lacked flavor as if it needed salt which is quite surprising since meat on pizza is usually salty by nature. Not so with this pizza. was the meat boiled prior and the saltiness leached off? idk.... Lots of cheese but nary of tomato sauce. Need a better balance with sauce and cheese... Bartender Emily's favorite dish at BJ's is their jambalaya. With so many attractive entrees in their picture menu  I had a difficult time selecting my entree. Warily  I went with Emily's recommendation and got the jambalaya. Thank you  Emily  for your suggestion! I rarely eat jambalaya so don't have a frame of reference to compare against  but this passed the taste test. Unless you have an aversion to cajun spice  I think you will enjoy this dish.Tried the Pizookie for dessert. Hot  large & thick cookie topped a la mode with ice cream. The contrast of the cold ice cream on the freshly baked cookie is a winning combo!To recap  mixed reviews on their deep dish pizza  but the jambalaya  8 beer sampler  and pizookie are winners! Ohh  and Emily is a hottie! With dozen's of locations throughout the US  BJ's could be a good spot to fall back on for a cheap-to-moderately priced meal..
Jane D.,Las Vegas  NV,0,25,1,4/22/2017,5.0,We come here atleast once a week. Rachel at the bar is the best! She's quite the busy bee too. We love her. We walk-in she already knows what we want. She has our drinks right as we sit. We came yesterday and Rachel was off another employee Justin took care of us. He was really worried about meeting our expectations which he successfully did. He knew we were regulars of Rachel and wanted to take good care of us. We order a somewhat confusing dish but Rachel and now Justin always seem to get it right. There's another bartender that has taken care of us and i can't remember her name but she is just as good. Her smile is contagious. Thanks guys for always treating us like were VIP!
Emily R.,Las Vegas  NV,1755,1640,10503,8/14/2013,2.0,I have to admit BJ's is probably one of my least favorite chain restaurants  so I'm never too excited to go to any location. I was meeting my OG Ryan B for lunch and I remember seeing a coupon for a large any style pizza so we couldn't resist. We came around 12:45 and it was packed. We were seated in the bar area on a high top table and were greeted relatively quickly by our server and gave her our coupon and put our order in for a large five meat deep dish. They were a little slow getting our drinks and refills were a little hard to come by at first  as we had to remind her a few times for drinks. We also had to remind them that we needed silverware  sugar for my tea as well as red pepper flakes for our pizza. Service was friendly however and I cut them slack for being so busy. As far as our pizza goes  it wasn't great. Not as hot and cheesy as I was hoping. Maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have added a crispiness that was needed. I definitely wouldn't have been happy about paying full price for the meal  but at half off it was ok. They took our coupon without problem and even gave us a free mini pizookie with our offer. This was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't blown away  but for free I was quite happy with it nonetheless. I won't be back without a coupon  but at a discount this place will do in a pinch and I do enjoy their beer selection quite a bit.
Tanya B.,Henderson  NV,0,4,11,10/4/2015,1.0,A picture is worth a lot- Due to the contamination by poorly handled meat products in the kitchen others could be at risk. Didn't have much concern for me- so likely didn't take much action behind the scene either. Meat that raw is truly a danger. Oh but took off that meal and 1/2 off the pizza and 1 root beer -I was so nauseated we needed to get up and leave-but had to wait for card to be returned. If I get sick there is proof in pics
Heidi M.,Henderson  NV,9,165,78,11/8/2015,3.0,Clean and friendly service. Food was okay-lacked seasoning. Menu closely reflects the same items as the cheesecake factory.
Mark J.,Reno  NV,889,426,228,11/17/2014,5.0,The best Jalapeo burger in town! Deep fried Jalapeos a half pound burger that is cooked to perfection!I have had it three times and each time it was awesome!
Heather H.,Las Vegas  NV,38,8,6,6/8/2015,5.0,Bry is awesome server!! Greeted us right away and even letbus move to a booth! (: Ordered our beers right off the bat and menu knowledge was strong. They got here quick and mmmmm berry cider brewed in house is to die for!!Ordered stuffed mushrooms and they were the best stuffed mushrooms I'd ever eaten EVER!!! NEXT the tomato salad with yummi mozzarella balls and fresh tomatoes!! And to finish the ahi ahi salad was so great!! Only.problem was I some how managed to get the whole glob of wasabi in one bite and just about died hahah. Next time no wasabi!!Over all bry was awesome and Justin another server also checked in on us(; they both rock. Thanks for an awesome time guys!!
Kara H.,Las Vegas  NV,22,29,6,11/23/2015,1.0,Came for dinner with my husband. It was busy because of football  but we were seated right away. The server took 15 minutes to get our drink order. We were annoyed  but I try to cut servers some slack  especially on busy nights. When he finally showed up  he took our full order  which came really fast. He never checked in with us  and my husband had to chase him down for refills. Meanwhile  our waiter is actually sitting down at the table behind us  giving them his Facebook info so they can add him.This stuff is annoying  but had he pulled it together for the bill  we'd have given three stars. Clearly  that's not what happened. Instead he took 30 minutes to get our bill from us. At the 20 minute mark  my husband walked up to the waiter at a station and tried to hand him a card. Without looking up  he told my husband he needed to sit down and wait. We weren't trying to be pushy  but 20 minutes is a long time to wait for a bill  and we needed to leave. At that point I went up front and asked for the manager  who couldn't have cared less about what her employees were doing. Total waste of money and time.
Vivi F.,Las Vegas  NV,58,53,292,10/29/2015,3.0,Nothing amazing just another chain restaurant. OK drinks and OK  food. We sat at the bar and waited for our bar tender  I'll say we waiting to long. She only checked on us a couple of times  we were here over 2 hours talking and only got 2 drinks.
Victor J.,Las Vegas  NV,81,16,,3/22/2016,5.0,This place is off the chi-zang!!!!!!!!!We had Brandon as our server. He said we should try the Root Beer glazed ribs which were amazing by the way. This place was clean  the energy was good  the wait to be seated was not long at all. I can't wait to go back to try some more of the mouth watering food.
Bethany E.,Henderson  NV,905,945,3660,4/11/2013,4.0,We planned a girls lunch and here I'm so glad we did! I had the enLightened Thai Chicken Salad. It was really good and under 575 calories!  Courtney was our waitress and she was excellent! Our drinks never went empty even during the busy lunch hour! Thank you for a great lunch!Tip: Sign up for BJ's Premier Rewards Membership before you go. You get seated much faster and they immediately email you a coupon for a free mini Pazooki!
Paulina M.,North Las Vegas  NV,1,5,6,2/8/2017,3.0,I enjoy eating at BJ'S but this time the food was different compared to other times we've ate there.. but service is very good!
Katie B.,Waikiki  Honolulu  HI,21,26,15,4/29/2016,4.0,There desserts are the best!!!! Never have I ever had a bad experience. I recommend the bj's favorite pizza. Its a deep dish pizza. The staff is awesome  they are pretty fast for always being busy. Which is a good sign :)
Mike B.,Las Vegas  NV,673,238,789,7/29/2014,4.0,"Let\'s be honest  we come here for the Pizookie!  Ice cream layered on top of a giant cookie. Mmmm.However this time around we also had regular food and beer. Loved their ""blonde"" beer.  It paired well with my Cajun Pasta w/ chicken  a dish I highly recommend getting here. We also tried their calimari which was standard. My friend had the southern style fried chicken. She said it was cooked and seasoned well and not greasy at all! Great.There is a separate bar area  plenty of seating in a nicely dim room. The ambiance was perfect for my group. Our only small irk was that our server was sometimes not present when we needed him. Trying to find him for the check after we were already full and ready to go was one thing. Putting in my debit card with the bill and trying to find him AGAIN just to pay for the darn thing is enough to drop 1 star from this place. Come for the great selection of beers and the food  keep an eye for your server or he might just get lost for some time."
Jenny D.,Las Vegas  NV,862,390,2596,3/31/2013,3.0,After waiting in line for over an hour to see the Easter Bunny Mandi L. and I decided we needed a bloody mary! Hunnie Bunnie wanted ice cream  so BJ's it is! First Mandi grabbed a booth inside but I thought we should sit outside to enjoy the beautiful weather. They set us up with a table but there was no umbrella shading it so it kind of sucked  but we decided to stay outside anyway. Another table said they were leaving soon so as soon as they did we grabbed their table and it was perfect. Hunnie Bunnie had a scoop of ice cream and we enjoyed some spicy bloodies. They garnish these with a big ol' celery stick  a pickled green bean  an olive and a picked pepper. Not bad. Could have used some MORE garnish like a pickle  a beef stick  a piece of cheese... LOL but that's just how I personally like them: mini salad in my bloody glass!
Roger E.,Las Vegas  NV,0,86,1,1/20/2016,4.0,Always been my favorite place to get something good.Casual  great service  eclectic menu  and priced right.
Chrystee Y.,Las Vegas  NV,280,190,134,3/29/2016,5.0,One of my favorite restaurants of all time!! The people are fantastic! Customers and staff are so friendly!!! Food is out of this world amazing! I'd give 10 stars if I could!!!
Kalynn W.,Henderson  NV,82,15,5,7/28/2015,4.0,A group of my friends and I come here almost weekly. The service is always great  the food is usually delicious  and it's a nice restaurant for any occasion  really. The other night my boyfriend and I went around 11pm  and the host left a lot to be desired  she wasn't very friendly at all  but out waitress Michell was phenomenal. Not only did she give us her honest opinion on selections  she kept the refills coming and we never felt like we had to hunt someone down for something. Honestly  I want to start coming and asking for one of her tables  because she made us feel welcome even if it was rather late in the night and she had another huge table she was serving. I'd definitely recommend asking for her as your waitress.
Makena M.,Las Vegas  NV,95,2,1,8/8/2016,5.0,I love love love this place so much. the servers are always very understanding & nice. from the 100 something times I've been here  they've only gotten my order messed up 2 or 3 times. they always make the food amazing and the pizookies are so good!! I highly recommend everyone come here :)
Perry P.,Las Vegas  NV,14,112,20,12/6/2016,4.0,overall  this was great! the food menu is starting to get bigger and bigger  similar to cheesecake factory. hopefully it doesn't get too big  gets overwhelming. the food was good. we started with the avocado egg rolls and they came out very fast  which was nice. the main concern was the service with our waitress. to start  the entire lunch took less than 2 hrs  about 1 hr 45 min. I think the biggest problem was our server...just slow and never around. for example  one of us ordered unlimited soup and salad and the waitress never came around to refill the soup or salad. when she did finally come by  we asked about a certain soup and she said she didn't know so she will bring a sample of it. that alone took 10 min to bring a sample. my friend liked the sample so he requested it and that took another 10 min. we even had to tell her that we were in a hurry  but still no change in service style  she was never around. on a plus note  the pazookie got more flavors/options (I think) and its still as good as I remember first having it. definitely end with a pazookie!
Jasper h.,Beverly Hills  CA,0,17,,8/22/2015,2.0,I have been here quite a few times and added a star because the service is great and the beer is solid  however the food is very weak.I first ate a BJs in Southern California about 10 years ago. The deep dish pizza was amazing; hot and fresh and very delicious  as was everything else. Now  the food at this location or perhaps at all locations is extremely subpar compared to what they used to serve. It almost always comes out room temperature and has obviously been pre-prepped and then slightly heated before being served. A deep dish pizza that comes out at room temperature is probably one of the most disappointing experiences a man can go through. However  if you can get the food made fresh  it is still great  but that's the problem.A couple visits back I had a dish that was as stated above  room temp and old. I let them know and they brought me a fresh dish; it was great. This is not how a restaurant should operate; especially not BJs  when the food can be great.I am pretty sure they keep this up because most people just accept it; sad. If you guys get your stuff together and start making the food fresh; let me know and I will give you another shot. Until then  no mas BJs for me.Why are people so accepting of this and still flock to this joint?!?!
Jay S.,Henderson  NV,0,7,,8/30/2015,5.0,Get RYAN as your waiter. Friendly knowledgable waiter. When u get a waiter like him it nakes my dining experience much more enjoyable.Food was enjoyable. Everyone is happy.
Patsy S.,Littlerock  CA,3,11,,7/8/2016,5.0,Love BJ'S we are regulars and have dined in and picked up multiple times. Food is reasonably priced  Thier membership gives awesome discounts and promotional items. Stay is amazing expecially Tam or Nick they are amazing waiters. They always take great care of us!!! We have also sat at the bar and the bartender was great very attentive  he also made me a special drink based on my pallet. Sad they got rid of the thier greenbeans but they let us substitute. Again if u want great service ask for Tam or Nick!!!!
Mark N.,Henderson  NV,393,44,32,6/9/2016,3.0,Had the calamari and it was super greasy and did not taste good at all  had to send it back. Ordered the mahi-mahi with a shrimp. The server Kenneth is awesome
Robert L.,Henderson  NV,90,13,3,8/10/2016,2.0,So I go to Bj's to have lunch with my Family on my day off  I get greeted and asked if I am a rewards Member I said yes! The Waitress come over and asked the same thing I said yes. I place my order she states I have ZERO POINTS before I get my food! I never asked for a discount so totally messed up my day already! Things should end in a positive at the end of your meal  thank you so much you have earned 1 point towards your future rewards card! is that hard. Plus the fact that her long hair was all over my food I went to have a real meal friends sorry Bj's not cool.
A S.,Palm Desert  CA,61,15,23,12/19/2015,5.0,Came here last weekend with my boyfriend and sister. We got seated just before the dinner rush. This place is huge and can house plenty of people. Our order of cheese sticks were great and very tasty. We also shared an order of tomato  basil and mozzarella salad. It was extremely fresh. Their club sandwich and fries that I got was just what I was craving. Really happy with our choice of going to BJ's. We'll be back next time we're in town.
Linda K.,Lake Saint Louis  MO,0,6,6,1/21/2017,5.0,Great food  wonderful server and atmosphere. Will be back when I'm here again from St Louis.
Jennifer D.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,4/7/2016,5.0,My husband and I came in for dinner with our two kids and my youngest was not happy. She was super hungry and cranky (9 months old). I put in the kids order as soon as our waitress  Shennah (not sure if I spelt that right)  came over. She came back with our drinks AND a starter for my kids. It was just a little kids starter but it was so appreciative and we've never had that given to us before. It made my daughter happy  and she devoured the fruit within a minute or two. We actually ended up ordering her an additional side because she loved it. Our food was good  but our waitress really made our experience enjoyable! She went above what we have ever experienced there before and we will definitely be back. If you stop in ask for her section. You'll be in great hands!
Paulina M.,Henderson  NV,8,108,1,6/15/2016,4.0,BJ' restaurant is such a fun place to go for a casual lunch or dinner. I really do love the location as well and my children can not get enough of their pizzookies if I being honest neither can I! it is a diffident item to get!
Matthew H.,Las Vegas  NV,10,16,2,2/27/2016,1.0,Today put the icing on the pizookie. Over the past several years we have been eating here. Our usual bill is almost $100 every time. For that kind of money I expect the food to taste better than fast food but not better than fine dining. I would have to say over the past six months that the quality in food and especially in service has hit rock bottom. It seems to rank even below Applebee's or Chilis. I have vowed not eat eat there any longer and urge you to find somewhere else  maybe a locally owed restaurant to support.
Billy L.,Monroe  MI,0,244,2,11/17/2015,4.0,The beer here isn't too bad  but nothing spectacular. They have about ten or so house varieties to choose from.My hickory brisket and bacon sandwich was excellent. Service was excellent and everything was clean and in good order.
Leslie M.,Phoenix  AZ,373,595,373,9/1/2014,3.0,"Me and some friends strolled in on a Sunday afternoon. They were serving brunch and the regular menu. Oh-my  brunch  you say? So I take a look at their brunch menu  but nothing I saw looked inviting so I decided to order the gluten free pizza with pepperoni  jalapenos  brussel sprouts  and mushrooms along with the beet arugula salad side. The pizza was tasty and better than some gluten free pizzas I have had  but it was a little small and they were a little too greedy on the toppings - there was even one slice that had looked like it had nothing but cheese on it. The beet arugula salad side was really just that - a side  but for $4.95  you\'d think it would be more than 5 bites  right or is it just me thinking that it should be more like 10 bites? It\'s just arugula  beets  some kind of nut  and dressing - so I would think they would be more generous. All in all  it\'s a brewery - with ""ok"" food  but I did expect that."
Geselle R.,Henderson  NV,886,381,4465,8/30/2014,2.0,Called to make a reservation and they told me to hold and they hung up on me. Called again and they didn't care that they hung up on me and gave me more attitude. Went in and they decided to give us even more awkward and not appealing attitude. Not coming back. Learn some manners. Looks are nice but that can only take you so far. Learn from the north town bjs. Not the first time I've had bad service here.
Orion O.,Henderson  NV,3,20,7,5/6/2015,2.0,"Well  for those that don\'t want to read a novel I\'ll break it down:The food is really good. The service SUCKS. It was seriously dreadful. Unfortunately we won\'t be coming back.I had dinner there last night with my parents. We were all excited to go  cuz someone told us it was really good. I really don\'t like leaving a negative review for places  but It was that bad.We came in about 7pm  and we went to the hostess stand. She just kind of stared at us  and never greeted us. Not a hello  nothing. Ok  whatever  maybe shes having a bad night or something. So we tell her that we\'d like a table for 3. The other hostess came over to seat us  and kind of dropped menus in front of us on the table and just left. No ""hi"" or anything. It was weird.The restaurant was a little busy  but there were still many open tables and a lot of FOH employees on the floor. It was a normal dinner time type of busy. Not anything extreme. Our server comes over and gets our drink order  and right off the bat he seems to really not want to be there. OhhhhKay.... do we like have the plague or something and not know?? We\'d really like to know if we are contagious or something.The food DID come out quickly  and we really enjoyed our appetizer. But  we would have enjoyed it even more IF WE HAD SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS. Like we tried to get ANYONE\'S attention to get silverware  but employes passed our table and glanced at us  then pretended not to see us! omg! So we used our 3 beverage napkins. We seriously tried to obtain some utensils. It was super lame. A runner came out and delivered our meals  and then she tried to bounce out all quick! So  we flagged her down as she was leaving and asked for silverware. And I hate flagging down an employee because I think it\'s rude and tacky  but we couldn\'t get ANYONE\'S attention any other polite way.Our server did keep our drinks topped off  but I would have loved to get another beer - but I couldn\'t!!! I was never asked if I wanted another  and I could not get him to stay at the table for more than like 3 seconds. By the end of our dinner  we actually laughed amongst ourselves because the service was unbelievably bad. We actually felt uncomfortable there. What sucks is we went there to enjoy ourselves  and the food was good. But wow... we made contact with 4 employees there and they all seemed standoffish  unfriendly  and we got the feeling that they all hated their job. Like they really hated it. I\'d go as far to say they despised working there. I mean  is there like a horrible manager there that they all hate?? We felt like we entered the twilight zone. As I stared longingly at my empty beer glass we got the 68 dollar check  paid and left. At least  at this very point we got a ""thank you""! That was nice  however too late to retain us as customers. What\'s sad is we really enjoyed the food  but we felt very uncomfortable. We were kind of annoyed that we felt obligated to tip  but we felt like it\'s just not right to not tip someone.So yeah... AKWARD!!!"
Candy R.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,446,89,748,4/8/2015,4.0,I love there late night happy hour. Really good food and drinks. Mojitos and wine are only 5 bucks and well drinks are 4 can't beat that and very fast service too. I'll be coming back for sure
Hayley P.,Las Vegas  NV,54,12,14,11/18/2016,5.0,"Great service! My mom took my boyfriend and I here the other night to celebrate his birthday. We sat in a booth at the bar. Venue was very clean and had a cool industrial look to it. William ""bill"" was our server. He was very cool and professional. He took our drink orders first. I ordered the blood orange sangria  which was very tart until I put the cinnamon stick garnish into it  after that it tasted great! It was happy hour at the bar  so we ordered the California flatbread as an appetizer  which was delicious and portioned big enough for us to share! For dinner I ordered the ""super salad"" with flame broiled salmon which was AMAZING! The salmon had wonderful flavor and I loved all the different fruits and veggies in my salad. My boyfriend ordered a burger and my mom had the roasted Brussels and kale salad. They both enjoyed their meals as well! For dessert  my boyfriend had a mini chocolate chip pazookie  free for his birthday. Came with a birthday candle and smile from our server  thanks bill! And my mom and I shared half macadamia nut  half chocolate chip pazookie which was delicious! I would definitely come here again."
Marc R.,Henderson  NV,0,9,,1/4/2017,5.0,Always great food and service here! The rewards program is awesome. Kitchen a little slow when they're slammed but worth the wait. Don't go to a big national chain for average fare  head in here and eat like a king! Nancy is my favorite server  always takes great care of us!!
LaShonda G.,Henderson  NV,0,8,1,6/15/2016,2.0,Absolutely not impressed this time around. I've been to many other BJ'S locations  however this one...uh...not great. We both ordered the jambalaya. Huge mistake. Both plates came out really cold. We sent them back (they microwaved them....); came back extra salty (I kid you not). We left. Probably won't be back. :(
J M.,West Hollywood  CA,0,1,,4/19/2015,1.0,Mediocre food. Mediocre service.I have tried othet BJs locations in the US which have been consistently good.Unfortunately I chose to have dinner last night at the Eastern Ave location in Las Vegas with a friend. Wait for table was short as stated.Nicholas  our server  was dismissive and blamed the long wait for our food on inexperienced kitchen staff . When food finally came  IT WAS COLD. As it probably stood in the kitchen for at least 10 minutes. Requested onion rings instead of fries. Greasy and cold.Will NOT recommended and will NEVER eat at this BJs again.Do yourself a favor and go to In-n-Out Burger instead. Better tasting burgers and much better service because at least there you get what you pay for. Not at this BJs
Jennifer M.,Henderson  NV,200,33,79,2/6/2014,3.0,I love the physical location. The revolving door  the huge wall of alcohol and beers -- its lovely :) But the food is o-k. I have had mixed experiences with staff so that's why it gets a 3. There was twice where we had 2-3 different servers( people training i think) then there was mass confusion.. And then there was a time where our server was on point. Overall - its a safe place to go to get variety on American food - and the Pazookie (my fave is the red velvet) is the business!
J C.,Las Vegas  NV,24,314,688,8/18/2015,4.0,Nice ambience. .. friendly service I was there few Days ago I wasn't too hungry but my wife was and she doesn't need too much unfortunately I forgot the name of the server she was very patient I'll explain the menu very well even helping me switching to another beer after I order one.I'll be back!
Emmalynn R.,Henderson  NV,10,38,63,3/27/2015,4.0,I am upgrading my rating because of BJ's new menu which includes now more vegan dishes.
Elaina C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,15,,11/24/2016,3.0,We ordered the ahi salad which I thought was always great but yesterday it wasn't the best. I wonder if they have changed the recipe. But my friend had the steak and it was good. The service was ok but it seemed like he was in a hurry for us to leave so he could go.
Bonnie P.,Henderson  NV,217,597,120,12/29/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Update time! I love most of  if not all  of the food I've tried here! It's such a huge menu to choose from. For dinner  my favorite meal is the balsamic glazed chicken. I absolutely the adore the sodas on tap. Black cherry and orange cream are my fav's. And the pizookie... well  I just can't pass up a pizookie. I can't find anything wrong with a warm cookie topped with ice cream  except maybe for how long it takes them to make it (so order early) and how bad it is for you lol.The downsides for me: dinner  drinks  and dessert at this chain restaurant really add up. It's not the cheapest. Also  the service can be pretty slow and the place gets packed. You can call ahead to put your name on the list so I recommend this if you're going on the weekend. I'm so pleased with the food here that I'm sure I'll keep on coming back. I've had worse service for way less delicious food so I can overlook it...
Jason S.,Valencia  CA,6,36,2,10/29/2016,5.0,Excellent service from takeout! My order was accurate and hot  and Savannah did everything above and beyond to help me out! Without her it would be just another chain pizza place! Stop by and have a pazookie!
Kush B.,Henderson  NV,193,52,33,2/14/2015,3.0,Decent food. Great for bar food and the self made beer was good to try but honestly not the best service. The value was good for the price and that is the best I can say about BJs
Trace R.,Las Vegas  NV,763,116,154,4/2/2015,5.0,Love the Henderson location. Always friendly staff and great food! Lots of choices! One of our favorite places for lunch :)
Kristin M.,Las Vegas  NV,59,68,50,3/4/2016,5.0,Everything was AMAZING. Rachael was so great made sure we kept having drinks. Very busy but great. Didn't miss a thing. She was very nice friendly and welcoming. I told the manager how great our service was and how delicious the food was. Can't wait to come back again great job everyone
Ron E.,Las Vegas  NV,54,3,17,10/10/2015,4.0,I stopped in for a beer after work. The service was fast  the atmosphere just right! I'll be back later for more beer!
Olga R.,Grand Prairie  TX,0,33,8,11/6/2016,3.0,Ok food. My steak came way overcooked  dry and rough  but the manager fixed it. Our server was a bit too chatty  to a point where she'd interrupt a conversation to try upselling alcohol and dessert  and then hung out around the table behind us taking loudly. Delicious brussel sprouts. The menu looked extensive  probably will be back to try other things
Brenda L.,Las Vegas  NV,324,431,1207,1/19/2012,4.0,This is for their chicken tortilla soup ONLY! YUMMMMMMMMMMMM is all I can say. I love how they come out with the bowl filled with the tortilla chips  avocado  lime and chicken and then they pour the broth in your bowl at the table. That way the tortilla chips are never soggy and it's just cool to see. I ended up ordering the half potato (grilled chicken) and soup. It definitely filled me up for $8.00-$9.00? There was a lunch rush  but everything seemed to come out quickly. Overall  I have always been a fan of BJ's and now that its walking distance from work I will be here more often.
Jay A.,Las Vegas  NV,267,431,581,11/17/2014,4.0,A chain restaurant but a very good chain restaurant. I often have to explain when I give this restaurant 4 stars  I am comparing it to other joints in their space  not to a fine dining or even a fast food place. Ok so now that we got that out of the way (until the next time I have to explain :)). Great burgers  great pizza  very great beer! Not so great french fries  yes I have had both kinds. They have the think cut  more like potato wedges  and thin  more like match sticks. Other than that everything is great and so is the service. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
Barney A.,Henderson  NV,29,88,178,12/18/2015,4.0,Great place. Lots of choices. Always good service. Great for large groups. Huge bar area. Lots of TVs to watch the games. Two thumbs up.
Stamone R.,Charlotte  NC,34,169,52,12/17/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,The staff here is too nice  too good at their job  they should all be fired for being too good and then be hired by Gordon Ramsay. The food quality is...above Applebee's  barely. The drink selection is solid  and the place is attractive and clean. Thanks place. Also   heads up to management  it says on Google that this location is open 24/7. I ordered the : Avocado Egg Roll - 9/10    Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza - 7/10              Fried Calamari - 4/10                  Pizookies - 11/10 ;)
Chris V.,Henderson  NV,758,884,4759,2/21/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I didn't see myself coming back here and trying the pizza again. However  with a group dinner scheduled for this place  I had no choice in the matter.It took a while after our reservation time  but we were finally seated in the dining area on the street-facing side of the restaurant. I found out that the food was presented buffet-style for us  and it was right up by the wall for us to access. I guess no enterprising neighbors bothered to try to filch some extra food  but we ended up with extra food at the end.Our menu included a house salad  with an Italian dressing and a ranch dressing  a grilled chicken pasta with creamy white sauce and broccoli (and apparently not enough chicken at all)  and various pizzas. The pizzas were way better than last time  mainly because the crust was not soggy. I guess they know how to cook the smaller pizzas than whatever gigantic monstrosity I experienced in my last review. I didn't get to try the combo  but the pepperoni and the chicken (with mushrooms and tomatoes) were both very solid.Most of us also ended up ordering mini pizzokies. My choice of the triple chocolate was a super sweet potentially-diabetes-inducing assault  and I enjoyed it aside from quickly gobbling up the Ghirardelli chocolate square because it wasn't going to be easy to break into small and even pieces.The one thing I didn't appreciate was that we didn't get refills on water until long after dessert. I didn't find any of the foods particularly salty  but I had a problem when I simultaneously craved and lacked water at the end of my meal. Thankfully  we got additional water refills even while we were just lounging and chatting after dessert  which made the night less uncomfortable in the end.Owing to the improvement in pizza  I'm comfortable in bumping my rating up to four stars. Although my first choice on Eastern Avenue wouldn't be a chain  I wouldn't mind coming back here at all.
Tushar J.,Las Vegas  NV,82,7,4,5/5/2015,5.0,So this is just a drink review. Bjs has an amazing selection of crafted beer. I tried the Nit Wit  Jeremiah Red and the Harvest hefeweizen. They were excellent! If you are a beer drinker  put bjs on your map and check it out for a fun time!
Micah L.,Henderson  NV,42,230,1920,1/18/2015,4.0,I first discovered Bj's when I lived in Orange County. I was stoked when I moved here and found out that there was one fairly close by. This place gets very packed on a weekend or Friday night but I have no problems with it. The staff is very friendly  fast and delivers great service. Love the huge menu they have with tons to choose from. My personal favorite is the Buffalo chicken pizza paired with my favorite beer a Jeremiah Red. If you got room left in your stomach there's the pazookie which is a bit of heaven baked into a cookie topped with icecream.
Darren H.,Henderson  NV,0,22,,12/19/2015,5.0,We really enjoyed this place. The ale was nice and they served up one of the best burgers that we have found in this town. We were seated promptly even on a very busy night and our waiter was on the spot with everything we needed. They without question exceeded our expectations going in to a chain. Well done guys!!!!
Mike F.,Las Vegas  NV,209,607,3871,5/28/2013,3.0,It was okay.I mean the place was very nice and clean. The food was okay. I had the wings and a friend of mine had the double cheeseburger and it was actually pretty good. Plus I do have to say that the house brew was good as well. My only problem was with the prices and the service. The prices were a bit pricey. For 3 people who had 1)wings 2)burger and 3) spaghetti w./no meatballs..the bill came too 50.00! The food was good  but not THAT good!...and on top of that the service moved pretty slow. It wasn't that busy and yet there was a great lag in service.Honestly  the food was good enough that we will come back and try it again one day...but if the service isn't improved  it will most likely be the last time..Update to come...but for now...3 stars.
Martin H.,Raleigh  NC,46,77,32,1/21/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"I have been back a couple of times  to a couple of different locations  and I love this place.Busy - for a reason! But I never have to wait very long. The service has been very good  the food consistent and the quality very good.Very happy with the beer selection  I don\'t remember the name of the ""Red"" but it was awesome...4.5 stars. Recommended."
Melissa C.,Las Vegas  NV,50,22,8,3/24/2016,4.0,Always busy. Too much spice this time on our regular entrees. Service a bit slow. Would have liked prompt drink refills to take the edge off the food. Prefer West Charleston location.
River H.,Las Vegas  NV,139,165,126,5/14/2013,3.0,It was Mother's Day  and after being dumped at the crepe shop  our group was feeling stood up and a touch angry- but were able to get a table at BJ's with a bearable wait time. I was surprised with how good the service was on such a busy day. The service was slow  but everything made it's way out within 40 minutes of when our food order was placed  and amazingly there was not a single thing wrong with any of our food. Is it sad that I expect something to go wrong with someone's order in a large group? This is a generic BJs  and the food is rarely ever anything that wows me so I was slightly disappointed that we had driven from NoLaVe to Hendertucky to get a pizza at BJs (huh.. hello.. we live around the corner from Old School Pizzeria!) but what really was outstanding was the service provided my the manager on duty. He was great in making sure our large group had enough room to dine comfortably  and even came back around to check up on us again. BRAVO! Finally  after a dry spell of awful service we have a day of good service  I had even started to feel like I was jaded about service.Will I be back? Probably not to this one since it's so far  but I have no problems visiting another BJs- we probably frequent the chain twice a year when I'm feeling too lazy to cook and we can't decide on anything.
April D.,Las Vegas  NV,853,818,981,5/19/2013,3.0,So this wasn't our first choice  or our second choice  or even our third choice. But it was lunch time on Mother's Day (I know...good timing)  so we took what we could get without having to drive around town. They were really busy (I know  big surprise!)  but they took really good care of our large party  the manager was our savior that day! The food was typical BJ's  I've eaten here before  Fridays/Chili's chain type food  it's average but not at all what any of us wanted (it's not their fault). I was in dire need of a cocktail at this point  I got the Tickled Pick  a bit sweet but good. We all shared some of the Children's Captain Crunch French Toast  it was good but you couldn't tell it had Captain Crunch on it:( I ordered the Shrimp Tacos for lunch  they were surprisingly better than expected.South Eastern Avenue has such a wide array of food choices I doubt I'll be back anytime soon  but it works when your stuck between a crepe and a closed place. (Inside joke)
M K.,Henderson  NV,2,9,1,4/5/2015,4.0,Stopped in for dinner on our way from Town Square. The staff is always warm and welcoming :)Their mozzarella sticks are absolutely the best ones I've ever had - hands down.We tried the Tavern-Cut pizza. It was pretty good with great food textures including chicken  peperoncinis  basil  onions and more. Overall  our meal was delish!
Tiffany M.,Lake Mary  FL,265,147,79,9/28/2014,5.0,I really love this place! It's always my go to... They have awesome low calorie options!! Like 20! Which is so rare! Also a good happy hour :) Kale salad is really great for like 410 calories. I was surprised at how good it is... Prob is my fav thing I've gotten on the low calorie meal list so far
Janice L.,Henderson  NV,340,185,16,12/17/2014,4.0,BBQ Chicken Pizza! Root Beer crafted in-house? Berry spritzer? I love love love their pizza and usually get the BBQ Chicken pizza (i'm a sucker for bbq) The location is large and has ample amount of parking being in the Eastern plaza. Great  friendly service!
Winnie S.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,15,50,80,1/5/2015,2.0,I'm not sure if it was just today. They were really busy when we came in on a Sunday night. The last time I came here the portions were HUGE! Now it was a lot smaller. We ordered an asparagus and spinach dip  clam chowder  California Burger  and a bunch of other stuff those are just ones I really remembered. The server looked nervous and rushed when he greeted us. We asked for a refill three times on our drinks and never got it. Our appetizers  asparagus and spinach dip  came after 10 minutes after our main dishes. It tasted bland. And my brother who eats anything even said it wasn't good. There was no taste. My moms clam chowder was way too salty. My burger was not a burger but rather a sandwich. The vegetables along with the avocados was slipping out.
Mandi L.,Las Vegas  NV,411,342,195,4/1/2013,3.0,"Unfortunately  my review of this place is a combination of 2 visits: 1 being a 4-star  and the other being a 2-star  hence a 3-star total.I came here last week and met a friend for dinner. We sat in the bar area were immediately greeted by a server. She was friendly and helpful. We ordered burgers  both of which were amazing. I got the Bacon Cheeseburger with a Chipotle mayo and he got the California burger. They were huge and I could barely finish mine.It always seems busy there  but we didn\'t have to wait on the server. I actually really like the busy atmosphere.I came here again with my best friend and goddaughter yesterday. We were craving bloodies and my goddaughter wanted ice cream so this seemed like the perfect spot. Right off the bat  the hostesses seemed completely uninterested and in a simple word  LAME. Their attitude screamed ""It\'s Easter  I don\'t want to be here."" They were just so blah and unfriendly. Anyway  after asking if the outside patio area was shaded  she said yes and that there was a table. She seated us out there at the one table that didn\'t have an umbrella. Luckily another table was just finishing up so we moved over as soon as they left. We got our bloodies and ice cream and were pretty happy then. Our server was nice enough and to our surprise  we were on happy hour the entire time so our bloodies were $1 off. The other thing that would contribute to the 2 stars is that several other tables left as we sat there and no one ever bussed the tables. It just looked sloppy and gross."
Gracie S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,10,,8/24/2016,5.0,Went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse last night  as usual their food is excellent  but what seriously stood out was our waiter  Nick. He's outstanding - he ran his backside off for everyone he waited on. He even noticed when the server delivered the wrong order to the table  he made it right even though we told him it wasn't necessary. WOW!! When I complimented him on his EXCELLENT service  he told us we could ask for him the next time we come in. I recommend everyone do the same  you will NOT be disappointed. That said  tip him well  all waiters/waitresses depend on it!!!
Chuck H.,Las Vegas  NV,301,396,270,8/21/2011,5.0,BJ's seriously doesn't need another review but ill give it a shot anyway. I got a flyer in the mail that said they were doing a special dinner and a date promotion. For $20 bucks you get 2 soups or salads  one medium pizza  and a shared poozkie (thats a desert). Then you pay $15 and get 2 movie tickets to a regal cinema.  I thought there had to be a catch but nope it was totally legit. The medium pizza is seriously HUGE. We couldn't finish the thing and i had to bring the rest home because it was just that good. We ordered the sweet pig pizza. It has real ham and chucks of pineapple on it. AWESOMEEEEEEEThe clam chowder was crazy. This is the first place that served me clam chowder that i didn't have to doctor up with a little salt and pepper. My wife ordered the tomato soup and that was pretty decent as well. The servers are always really nice here and don't allow us to run dry on drinks or feel neglected. The only thing stopping a five star rating is well  actually nothing. Im changing this sucker to 5 stars.
Bridget J.,San Diego  CA,11,48,50,12/22/2014,5.0,BJ'S Brewery has always been a favorite.  I first discovered them in Tucson AZ. Today in Nevada. Great beer Grand Gru
Vanessa A.,Las Vegas  NV,259,670,174,5/23/2013,3.0,Cap'n Crunch French Toast = YES PLEASE!!!!!!!!It sounded so fantastic that we ordered 3 for the table. There were 13 of us who met up for brunch......on Mothers Day! We tried and failed at Crepe Expectations  we tried and failed at Blue Island (it was going to be their last day of business as owners had bailed on business the waiter/host advised). I called Republic and they couldn't seat us til 4. I called here and they said it would be about 40 minutes. We got there about 25 minutes later and they told us it would be about 25-35 minutes. Mothers Day is quite the day for brunch/breakfast/lunch.It was slow to start  the drink order took a while. Then we had to order our food  then wait for it. But  once one meal came out  they all came out pretty quick after that. Back to those Cap'n Crunch french toast.......they came out first. They were OK. I think we all dreamed of TASTING Cap'n Crunch in the french toast. But you dont. You want to  you know it's there  but it doesnt taste like it one bit. It doesnt taste bad  not at all  but it doesnt taste like you imagine it will. The table ordered a ton of food: Breakfast pizza  Surf n Turf  french toast  shrimp taco's  pulled pork sandwich  ahi tuna salad  breakfast sandwich and a few others I'm forgetting. The portions are nice size. The potatoes with the breakfast pizza weren't seasoned well. There was way to much omelette on the pizza. The cheese could have melted more too. I think everyone was so hungry  and the food was OK  we ate. But I dont think anyone had anything spectacular that I'd rush back for. Although  I did hear they have a dessert that's a cookie in a cast iron skillet that they bake fresh with ice cream on top. That sounded so good. But maybe it's like the Cap'n Crunch french toast. Disappointing :(
Kennedy N.,Las Vegas  NV,0,15,,1/17/2015,5.0,Just went here for the first time. Service was VERY prompt and attentive  despite it being quite busy. Was in a party of 3  and everyone was happy with their meals. Drinks were refilled with perfect timing. Extensive menu options. Very nice portions for the price and good quality. Have not read any other reviews so I don't know if others have had complaints or not  but I have none whatsoever. The only tiny mistake they made was that our appetizer came very shortly before our entres. I will not let that take away a star however  because that too was delicious  and I simply used it to complement my main dish. Very satisfied experience overall. :)Thank you.- Ken
Jenna W.,Henderson  NV,0,12,2,8/15/2016,4.0,We are new to town and received a gift card from friends. They easily and quickly sat our large family (and saw lots of large groups). The menu is huge with lots of options suit your mood. You can also select a couple small plates  soups  and salads. We had the avocado egg rolls which were great. The kids menu is great. Lots of healthy choices for all and very vegetarian/vegan friendly options. My husband liked the beer choices and ordered a tasting flight. Overall affordable with generous portions.
Jamie B.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,457,74,236,10/11/2015,5.0,awesome food  excellent service... every. single. time. consistency is very important to us and this place is probably #1 on the list! whether we do delivery  curb-side pick up or dine-in we love us some bj's
Terri A.,Las Vegas  NV,75,33,15,12/5/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Server could've been more attentive. Sat in dining area instead of bar. My steak too done.
James W.,Aliso Viejo  CA,1,7,,9/19/2014,1.0,I like BJS but this location sucks takes for every to get any thing. Servers got their nose in the air. Food gets messed up.. I've been to this location three times same story..Good luck to all that go to this location you'll be there for awhile..
Lea G.,Las Vegas  NV,1491,448,316,3/7/2013,4.0,It's BJ's! They are the same everywhere. Good service and good food. My kids enjoy BJ's and talk me into it once in awhile. I love their Avocado rolls and Lettuce wraps!! Of course  how can you leave without eating a deliciously warm  melt in your mouth pizookie!!!
Mazlina P.,Los Alamitos  CA,10,14,17,1/4/2015,5.0,Wonderful experience tonight. Pizza was extraordinarily delicious. Good-looking staff in smart outfits were efficient & attentive service. Deco & ambience were outstanding.  Will come again for family outings & staff happy hours.
Kerry J.,Henderson  NV,1,51,33,7/5/2016,4.0,We went with Family on Friday night for a Birthday dinner and Happy Hour. We had a wonderful server named Paula. Paula was the BEST server I have seen in a long time. She made us feel like we were family and anticipated our every need. The food was good  but the Happy Hour needs help. Happy hour is only good on Mondays for the 1/2 price pizzas  otherwise they need to work on better pricing for expensive beer  and very few choices for food.
John Z.,Las Vegas  NV,2,5,,6/18/2014,1.0,If I could put zero stars I would. Terrible EVERYTHING.I would rather have eaten rocks from a homeless persons shopping cart. California apparently means bread + burnt party. On the upside it was precut making its terribleness much more apparent. After numerous terrible talks with the waitress I finally obtained items which were listed on the menu. It was rewarding to build my burger to my taste as I felt a sense of accomplishment but I digress. Luckilly planes fly over constantly and it gave me hope one might by chance crash into the restaurant and end my dinner early  proper.
Paul W.,Miami  FL,869,1187,550,10/24/2012,4.0,A business associate who works in Vegas invited me to dinner on a Thursday night. Since he lives and works in this city  he didn't want to go anywhere particularly touristy  so he brought me here to this restaurant  which is about 5 miles away from the strip.BJ's is a national chain restaurant and microbrewery which is a bit like Gordon Biersch  but BJ's features a few more comfort foods on their menu and it has more of a family restaurant feel to it. This restaurant is located in a strip mall-type location where there are several storefronts with bars and restaurants  and I get the feeling this must be mecca for many locals  as the parking lot of the entire complex was packed on this night  and we had to wait 20 - 25 minutes for a table for 2 at 7:30 on a Thursday.I tried their Pumpkin Ale (one of my favorite fall beverages) and was a fan. For our meal we shared an order of their Ahi Poke which was delicious and really hit the spot since I was very hungry. For dinner  my friend had the chicken fried steak  and on his suggestion I had the old fashioned pot roast which was served with white cheddar mashed potatoes  mushroom gravy and veggies.Everything I had was excellent  service on this night was very good aside from one slip up (they only gave us one set of cutlery and it was difficult to find a service staff to get a second set). I'd like to return to one of their locations at some point to try more of their other microwbrews.
Art M.,Las Vegas  NV,122,18,2,8/21/2015,5.0,Great food and spirits I usually sit at the bar and always a+ service Emily is the best bartender in this place.
Erin Q.,Las Vegas  NV,1,27,1,8/17/2014,2.0,They will not fill any growler that is not from BJs. They want you to buy a BJs growler first.This was disappointing because if you walk into ANY other brewery and hand them any growler... They will fill it. I'm trying to give you my money. Why won't you take it?
Jay J.,Las Vegas  NV,174,536,422,3/13/2011,4.0,We really liked it  it was our first time there.  We really liked the beer  lots to choose from. We ordered the Itialian Salad  and the pulled pork sandwich with skinny fries. The salad was good  the salad dressing that came with it was very light.But the pulled pork......ummmm  ummmm  ummmm  ummmm ummm! there was so much that I wanted to try  so I know i will be back. Very nice place to go  you can go wih jeans or a suit.....I even saw a girl in sweats.Deserts looked awsome.....I will be going back one day soon  just to try the desert.
Cissy B.,Henderson  NV,0,8,,8/2/2016,3.0,We have been having dinner at BJ's a couple of times a month for the past couple of years. The food and service are always good and we enjoy the vibe of the restaurant. So dinner last night was delicious as usual. We got the bill and paid cash  expecting change back. The server returned $0.50 of the $6.47 we expected. Granted  a 20% tip was going to be $6.20 and we normally tip well  but we didn't tell her to keep the change. And she gave us back 2 quarters! I don't know what to think except that we decided we wouldn't plan to go back again...ever. It should have been up to us to leave the tip.
Rob R.,Henderson  NV,0,15,4,12/10/2015,1.0,This place is not great during dinner time. I came here today and asked for a booth for 5. After a 20min wait we are seated at a table. We asked for a booth then we were told we can wait for a booth to open up. It's would of not been a big deal but I have had this happen 3 times in the past week so this made me finally give up on this place. I'll still come for lunch but not for dinner.
Denise T.,Las Vegas  NV,12,34,19,10/18/2014,5.0,I love the pizookie!!!! The cookies and cream is my favorite. I've been so sick and at midnight I start getting some appetite back  I really wanted a soup but where can I get one at midnight? Luckily I don't live too far from this lovely restaurante and it was open till 1 am to order. I always have to have their tortilla soup. So I was glad I was able to get to go at 1am. What isn't there to love about this place?
Michael C.,Henderson  NV,0,27,,8/16/2015,1.0,Unbelievably horrible service  ordered grilled chicken with all topping when I repeated three times what I exactly wanted only and second time they sent it on a hamburger bun not even cooked when it says it comes on sourdough. Jaime the manager then blamed me for the mistake cause she said I repeated it to you like I'm the idiot. Avoid this place at all costs like I will in the future. Their are too many good restaurants on Eastern avenue to choose from to spend your hard earned money. I wish I could leave zero stars because they failed tonight 8/16/15.
Mandy A.,Grand Rapids  MI,20,57,10,9/21/2014,2.0,I ended up in the emergency room within an hour of eating here with a terrible allergic reaction to something. I'm deathly allergic to shellfish and didn't order anything with shellfish in it which scares me that there is cross contamination with the shrimp in the kitchen. I will more than likely not be back  in fear that could happen again.
Carly J.,Las Vegas  NV,6,67,12,3/11/2015,4.0,Although wait time can be a little long  They always have amazing service! I have tried numerous things on the menu  but somehow always resort back to their famous cheese and tomato pizza! Love it and will continue to come here. Always gotta have their pazookie!!! You're missing out if you haven't had one
Karole R.,Henderson  NV,474,147,1806,6/1/2014,4.0,Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options
daniel g.,Las Vegas  NV,5,11,2,8/1/2015,3.0,I am a local. That is I was born here. Since BJ's open I've been here a lot and by that I mean weekly. I would say 2 out of 5 times it goes wonderfully  but 2 out of 5 is why I don't come here as often is why I don't come here as often but it is convenient and most people are satisfied. And rightly so they do have some excellent things before they change the jambalaya it was my very favorite. And the Jeremiah red is the best micro brew available in a restaurant chain. I am @ at BJ's today with my mother in law and enjoyed a mushroom Portobello swiss burger rare the first time it came out was not correct however the server rectify the situation quickly and I had a wonderful meal. But he insisted to call the manager over which seemed rather unconcerned with problem with the food. Despite the lack of managerial assistance the meal went great.
Lawrence H.,Henderson  NV,0,3,,8/28/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have received in a long time. The menu is to die for  everything on it is exceptional  they will be seeing a lot more of me and my family. They went above and beyond with their service. They forgot we were outside on the patio and extended every possible courtesy to make our visit worth while. Paula was our server and she was PHENOMENAL if anyone goes there please make sure you ask for her section you won't regret it.
Derek F.,Pompano Beach  FL,391,246,45,7/12/2015,5.0,Solid place I always love BJ's... Either get the balsamic chicken or the Parmesan crusted chicken always a good choice don't forget the Brussels sprouts!!
Fred U.,Henderson  NV,1,25,1,7/24/2015,5.0,I have been to several other BJ Brewery around the country and they all mainly behave like typical chain restaurant where the servers don't care and food is horribly prepared. This restaurant is different. The servers are friendly and professional. Food is not too salty or greasy. I recommend this restaurant because they care that customers are happy. They show that they want customers to return.
Marissa V.,Henderson  NV,7,13,8,5/31/2015,1.0,Used to love this place but it has just ran completely downhill  and I will not return. Yesterday (Saturday) I went to lunch around 4 o'clock and was so disappointed. First  upon walking in we were greeted warmly  which was nice. Then  when I requested a booth the hostess seemed put out  but we were seated at a booth regardless. We waited 7 minutes to be greeted by a server. Once we were finally greeted  we were informed we didn't get greeted because the hostess put us in a section that didn't have a server and failed to inform someone to pick our table up. Ok  I guess. At least it wasn't the servers fault. When we finally order  I ordered their enlightened turkey burger  and asked for our sever (I believe his name was Steve or Steven) to ring it in just as a turkey burger with lettuce  onion  and avocado. My guest ordered the California club. When our food finally arrived  we both take a bite out of it  as we were starving. To our dismay  both of our orders are wrong. My turkey burger is not a turkey burger at all  but a veggie burger. (Granted  this veggie burger was tasty. I definitely recommend for vegetarians.) My guest takes a bite out of her sandwich  which doesn't have the bacon or tomatoes on it it is supposed to have (and that is pictured.) I send my not-turkey burger back and her sandwich. The server apologizes  and we wait. My burger finally arrives  and it is still wrong. The toppings that are supposed to be on the burger  are not. My server goes and gets the toppings that are supposed to be on it and returns a few minutes later. Situation rectified. My guests sandwich finally arrives  with the bacon and tomato  but they didn't replace the sandwich? They bring back the same sandwich with her bite still taken out of it? I'm not sure how sanitary that is that the cooks are touching foods that have been partially eaten and sending it back out! Although all three mistakes were remedied  I'm severely disappointed a manager did not stop by the table to at least apologize or table tough at all. Our server was not bad  as I'm sure these were errors in the kitchen. Ultimately though  I'm disappointed and will not be returning to BJs due to the consistent errors.
Scott D.,Henderson  NV,45,10,,4/27/2014,1.0,There is a reason this place is called BJ's. Once you've had it in your mouth  you won't want to swallow! For some unknown reason  when my coworkers want to go out for lunch  they always want BJ's. Every time we have gone there  the service was atrocious. We wait forever for our food and some of us get served 10 minutes before others. The food is mediocre and generic at best. One time I ordered baby back ribs and they were literally the worst ribs I have ever had. They were undercooked and tough (ribs should fall off of the bone) and had absolutely no flavor. There was very little barbecue sauce on them and I ended up leaving hungry. My wife ordered a pasta dish (how hard is it to ruin a pasta dish?!) and it had no flavor. She had to dump a large quantity of salt on it just to make it palatable. On top of that  the waitress was very rude and inattentive. Another thing I hate about the place is the TVs everywhere. When I go out with friends  I want to spend time talking with them  not watching TV. TVs in restaurants are very distracting and you find yourself looking at them even if you have absolutely no interest in what is being shown (our brains are actually wired to focus attention on movement). My advice is to avoid BJ's (at least this particular location) and go to McDonald's. At least it will be fast and you know what you are getting!
Addy L.,Las Vegas  NV,127,114,72,4/7/2013,3.0,BJ's makes due when you're with a group of people who are all craving something different. Although the food is mediocre  there's something for everyone.I've been here several times  but my most recent visit was Saturday after the Spartan Race. We were a group of 6. We started with nachos  potato skins  and wings. Potato skins and wings were pretty good. The nachos were okay..I was craving pizza so I got an individual 5 cheese pizza with pepperoni. Half of the pizza was good. The reason I say that is because the whole inner half was soggy. A complete mush  so I was only able to eat half.Had a chocolate chip pazookie for dinner. Yum! Service was really good.
Louisa M.,Las Vegas  NV,876,1057,6655,3/29/2013,2.0,"I decided to give this place a try last week and I may or may not ever go back. The food was good (I ordered my food low carb: a double cheeseburger without a bun and a side of broccoli instead of fries). The kitchen was very accommodating and didn\'t give me a hassle about the substitution. The burger was really good and had a nice chargrilled taste to it. My problem was with the portion size of the broccoli. I know veggies are more expensive than potatoes  but COME ON! I was served 5 little florets of broccoli; one was cut in half to try to fill the empty space more. (See the photo I uploaded). I took a picture of my plate the minute it was served to me. Was there a broccoli shortage or something? I thought that was ridiculous. The menu isn\'t too varied but they seem to have lots of pizza options. The ""brewhouse"" element of the place is really played down. They have a few beer tanks in the far back corner that are hidden out of view. The food was good  the ambiance was fine  but the service was absolutely horrendous! We weren\'t greeting when we walked in the place for about 10 minutes -- on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 pm! This is a busy time and restaurants need to have on their ""game face."" When we finally were greeting  we got a nice table but then we had to wait and wait and wait for a server to greet us. Finally  after 15 minutes  we were approached. We ordered drinks...and then had to wait and wait and wait to get them! Finally we ordered our food  which took over 30 minutes to arrive. People at adjacent tables were all complaining (loudly) about how bad the service was. Our waiter disappeared for the entire meal  and we finally had to get up to go find somebody to ask for our check. It was abysmal. There were plenty of employees around  but our waiter was HORRIBLE. I don\'t know if I\'ll ever go back because the service was just so bad."
Paul W.,Las Vegas  NV,339,898,439,6/6/2012,4.0,BJ's has an extensive menu with something for everyone. When you can't decide where to dine it will always work in a pinch.
Chris M.,Henderson  NV,0,8,1,3/24/2016,5.0,"I visited BJ\'s two nights ago solo with my two small kids. We had to wait a bit as it was a busy spring break night  but upon seating we were immediately greeted by our server  Dan. Dan was speedy and courteous and kind  and our food came out really quickly! Everything was delicious but what made the experience over-the-top great was Dan\'s professionalism  patience and kindness during our meal. Mid-dessert  my youngest needed to use the restroom so we asked Dan to make sure no one cleared the table while we were away. When we returned  we saw that Dan had made a fort of napkins and empty metal pitchers with a handwritten sign ""DO NOT TOUCH"" over the half-eaten pizookie plate. We laughed so much. The best customer service we\'ve received anywhere in recent memory! Thank you  Dan!"
Jason R.,Henderson  NV,3,110,12,12/27/2015,4.0,The pizza is outstanding! Their berrs selections are great. Too bad they haven't built a location near the Galleria Mall
Alana F.,Round Rock  TX,295,109,62,5/23/2012,4.0,Ok so I went here with my bf and our lil man for dinner one night  I hadn't been their in like 10 yrs so it was pretty much all new to me. We were sat immediately. Our waiter who was super nice took our drink orders and we also decided to order an appetizer. We ordered pot stickers for the appetizer. The pot stickers were very tasty. As for my main course  I decided to order the baby back ribs. The ribs were very flavorful  and very meaty. I had a baked potato (loaded) as a side which was also tasty. My son ordered mini kids corn dogs  which he enjoyed. My bf ordered a steak which he devoured quickly so I guess he liked it. Than again he devours everything quickly. Overall this place exceeded my expectations. I would come back again. The food was delicious  good quality  with huge portions  and our server was awesome.
Dru S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,9,,6/21/2016,5.0,BJ's is a nice bar. They have no video poker and are completely non smoking  which is nice in Vegas because most bars have video poker and smoking. The food is pretty good for bar food and the beer is definitely above average for brewpubs.
Vinny P.,Henderson  NV,0,10,1,12/18/2015,3.0,We meet at BJ's a lot after work. Food is good and their selection of draft beers is huge. I belong to their points club  just got a free dinner. Nice perk.The bartenders are well educated which helps when wanting to try a new pour.
Ashley C.,Sparks  NV,0,14,1,11/23/2016,5.0,This was our first time eating out as a family after discovering our 6 year old has all sorts of food restrictions. It was a little nerve wrecking but it turned out great. When we arrived I asked for an allergy menu. It was super easy to use. We ordered a gluten free pizza with mozzarella cheese (not the normal 5 cheese blend because my son can't have aged cheeses like cheddar). The manager  Joe  came out shortly after to let us know they didn't have shredded mozzarella but 'pearl mozzarella balls' and asked if that would be alright. We were just so happy they could accommodate us we didn't care. Pizza came out and my tiny eater ate almost the entire thing! Joe came back to check on us to make sure everything turned out ok. We were so appreciative of the personalized treatment. Our server was also fantastic as she was peppered with questions by us about everything. I'm so sorry I forgot your name to give you proper credit. Of course  the rest of our food was great and my other two boys devoured all their food as well. Thank you so much BJs!!!
Jessica M.,Henderson  NV,18,35,11,10/13/2014,4.0,Love! Love! Love! The pazookis are ridiculously amazing. Seriously a must have. Yummy pizza :) I always end up getting beer  appetizers and of course the pazookis. Excellent customer service no matter what time. I usually end up here with the girls around 11pm and they are always super friendly!
L J.,Las Vegas  NV,0,202,21,8/25/2014,5.0,This location is just down the road from me and I'm usually there on a Sunday evening for our date-night. We sit at the bar because honestly the 2 bar tenders that usually serve us are great. I feel so bad that I can't remember their names (considering I go at least 4 times a month!) but I'll be sure to ask next time! The girl makes great margaritas and the guy is really good with food recommendations. They just have a great energy and are very amusing  just as bar tenders should be. We'll see you soon for pizza and pizookie...try the salted caramel one  it's the best (and I usually fight my man til the last bite).
Danny R.,Oakland  CA,66,19,8,4/16/2014,1.0,I'm writing this as I wait.Its approaching 30 minutes that I have been waiting (no exaggeration) for the $5 Mac and cheese.The couple next to me has had a drink and then ordered and then got their food before me.I'm not really sure why I haven't asked for a refund yet..Its sad because the food is really good.But I feel like the biggest sucker every time I come here.They are consistently slow with the service and food delivery.Its to the point where I have made friends with other people eating here because we start joking about how sad this wait for our food is.I've given them the benefit of the doubt a few too many times. This location seriously needs to get it together.
Tesha K.,Las Vegas  NV,16,68,38,7/15/2015,5.0,Quality customer service. I really enjoyed the kindness and conversation from Justin at the bar and the enlightened salmon bowl was the perfect healthy dinner. Keep up the wonderful work!
Jennifer P.,Las Vegas  NV,176,282,212,7/13/2014,3.0,It's BJ's Brewery  a huge chain establishment  but the food is always good and they have a huge variety of items!The service is consistent- staff is friendly and attentive.The parking lot is always a lil chaotic- this whole shopping center can be a mess....
Tyler H.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,317,32,6,8/13/2015,4.0,Had the unlimited soup and salad which was awesome! I could only make it through 3 salads and 3 soups. Best being the tomato mozzarella salad and the tortilla soup. I was a bit disappointed they were out of their home made root beer!!
Rockne H.,San Francisco  CA,761,639,2594,11/18/2012,5.0,Man  I totally made a mess of the evening before  so I had to meet a friend to work out a situation. We wanted to go to a place that had great food and a great vibe...that I've never been to. Ok  so I can't lie and say that although we had to talk about something important  a small part of my decision to go to BJs was because A.) I haven't been there  B.) I heard it was really good and C.) It would give me the opportunity to make a review on Yelp :)This place has a huge buzz  well at least from what I experiences. True it was on a Saturday night but the place was packed with people  the lighting was hip and the overall vibe made me excited to be there! They have their own signature brews and offered many menu options? Uh  yes please! Our server was quite but didn't a good job. For my first visit  here's what I got:Drinks: A couple of glasses of the Piranha Pale Ale. It's a hoppy ale and had a snappy flavor. Apparently this beer took Silver in some American beer festival in the past  so I had to try it. Appetizer: For the table  we got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Grilled shrimp glazed with spicy Thai sauce  served on a bed of Napa cabbage  cilantro  carrots and red onion  all tossed with a fresh  minty mango salsa and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Served in butter lettuce cups with a spicy Thai sauce for dipping. The shrimp to everything else ratio was great and the sauce really pulled all the components together. Sooo good! A little messy but I definitely looked passed that!Meal: For my meal  I got the New enLIGHTened Thai chicken mango salad. Grilled  marinated chicken breast  chili spiced jicama and mango strips  red bell peppers and red onions on a bed of mixed baby greens  bibb lettuce and arugula tossed in a sweet citrus-chili dressing and topped with fresh sliced avocado  mint  green onions and sesame wonton crisps. Trust me  that description was taken from BJs' website  I'm not that good at descriptions  however  I am good at giving my take on it. Probably one of the best salads I've ever had. The spiced jicama complimented the sweet mango and the bell peppers gave a crisp texture. This salad was packed with seemingly clashing components but it all worked well together. So for all of you who want to know  yes  we worked out our differences and made a possible bad situation into a completely better one. I definitely think the food had something to do with it. The place had a great buzz and I can't wait to come back! Thanks guys!!
Jennifer J.,San Francisco  CA,303,159,208,3/15/2014,3.0,It's BJ's.. A giant chain so the food is going to be generic and nothing amazing. Even though I only gave them 3 stars this is a positive review. I can't say i like the food but i don't hate it. In large establishments  I expect consistency and quick service which they seem to have. I've been a few times and the service seems good. I would recommend it if you have a picky eater because most chain places are made to please the masses. I didn't mind the happy hour. Good options for good prices but it's nothing to rave about. The parking is decent but a little chaotic. This whole shopping center can be a mess.
Brian B.,Anaheim Hills  CA,422,692,43,6/5/2014,4.0,It's BJs  what I would expect  not like I haven't eaten there before. Only 4 stars because of the problems with the bill. We  a very large group  were at a conference and BJs was there hyping their restaurants. I can eat a BJs at home  why would I want to go to Vegas to eat at a hometown chain? Well  very large group and they offered us a 20% discount... Still  I would rather have spent the same 4 figures at restaurants on or near the strip. When the bill came  they did not want to honor the discount promised. In the end they finally gave in  but still it was more than a half hour fighting with the manager.
Jessica P.,Beaverton  OR,66,295,,4/30/2012,4.0,BJ's has to be one of my favorite chain restaurants in Vegas! They have incredible lunch specials and literally everything on the menu is good. My husband and I eat here at least once a month. We usually share a small pizza  which is plenty. They serve deep dish style pizza  while not exactly reminiscent of Chicago it is no doubt delicious. There isn't really sauce on the pizza  but there are tomatoes which I tend to push aside. The pizza is best complimented with a delicious Cobb salad. This salad is fantastic with a creamy garlic dressing  croutons  turkey  avocado  and cheese. I also enjoy their sandwiches and you really can't go wrong with their wedge or shoestring fries. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like and they have quite an extensive menu. It is seriously delicious American style food.If you find yourself here you really must get a Pizookie for dessert  it is required and I often come here just for a Pizookie! Who doesn't want a warm chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla bean ice cream? So unbelievably yummy. I have received spotty service at times  but overall BJ's is a fantastic go-to restaurant if you want quality  affordable  and delicious food that everyone will love.
Melanie S.,Henderson  NV,12,2,,2/26/2015,1.0,Was there recently and usually when I go everything is fine but this time I ordered chicken wings my usual fave and got the worst food poisioning from them staff need to retake their health card quiz and know how to handle chicken properly so people don't become deathly ill!!
Carla R.,San Diego  CA,0,5,,5/24/2016,5.0,We have been to this particular restaurant 3 times this year. Food is great  Stevie is friendly and knowledgeable and process reasonable (don't tell them  they msy raise them! ). Love that jambalaya!
Kim M.,Las Vegas  NV,8,8,3,3/22/2015,2.0,Food is so good. It's a shame they can't figure out how to provide the ultimate customer experience. Empty coffee and no silverware is not acceptable for that warm fuzzy feeling !
Sandra F.,Las Vegas  NV,0,21,15,8/17/2014,5.0,Love the food here and huge selection of beers. Its hard to find a bar/restaurant with good food but u will definitely find both at BJs. I recommend their flatbreads  burgers  and for an appetizer I would go with bruchetta... so good!
Tida C.,Las Vegas  NV,1179,157,875,1/30/2012,5.0,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BJ'S! Food: I love the Cajun Pasta  Usually when I go out to eat I'm not very adventurous. I like to stick to what I know but for some odd reason I decided to try something new. Cajun pasta  hmm first off I wasn't to sure how I would like this because I love Cajun spices of on my seafood but I wasn't to sure how I'd like it on my pasta. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. The creamy tomato sauce with the roasted blacken chicken breast YUMMMM. The portions are even great  once me and my boyfriend went and we actually just ordered 1 Cajun pasta and when asked them for an extra plate because we were sharing they offered to just put it together in the kitchen for us & it was perfect for two! Desert: If you haven't tried Bj's famous Pizookie your missing out. A cookie that's freshly baked right out of the oven warm topped with Vanilla ice cream is to die for. Even when I'm stuffed from my entree i'll still find room for a Pizookie. Some how! lolDrinks: I love their wide range of beers on tap  unfortunately they didn't have the blue moon pumpkin beer because it's only a seasonal beer. Tap beer is always better then bottle or canned Just saying...Service: I usually go pretty late like 9:30-10ish? & I'm usually 1 out of 5 tables there. So its not busy during those hours but the waitress that we got was super nice. The hostess seated me and my boyfriend at a table that was just way to big for us and it made it difficult for us to kind of talk and dine together so the waitress noticed this and asked if we wanted to change tables. Other than that and when ordering she offered to tell the cooks in the back to split my Cajun pasta into two plates because I was sharing. I've never been to a restaurant where they offered to split it in the back for me. Usually they just hand me my extra plate so I really appreciated the extra effort to help :)
Ruth And David R.,Las Vegas  NV,17,23,1,12/13/2014,5.0,Went there only once so far and we had a very good lunch. Prices aren't bad and the food and service was very good. Wanted to try the hard cider but didn't want to get a glass full  so the server brought me a sample  (Ugh!) Not for me. Ill just stay with the cold beer  Thank you. Will be back soon.
Jason W.,Las Vegas  NV,88,93,173,5/14/2014,4.0,BJ's is great for happy hour in the bar area. Great prices during this time. They have a few drink specials and food menu items.order a mini pizza  lettuce wraps  flat bread something with avocado  and mini sliders. it was filling for three people that we had and it was a little disappointing with the lettuce wraps and there was only three pieces of lettuce and to me lettuce is the cheapest thing as it was just head lettuce or ice burg as they are called.I had a glass of there root beer from tap and a glass of the black cheery from tap as they make there own. They had some kind d of santa fe spring rolls and avocado roll also on the menu and some kind of parmesan boneless chicken. If you go at four pm it is just the right time as they are not busy  but the service was kind of slow  but if you are there with people great chance to chat and catch up without being rushed  as the service is just the right speed at this time of day before the dinner rush. Will need to go back to try the other happy hour specials that I haven't tried yet.tried the full dinner menu items as well and they have a lot of choices to chose from. menu is quick large  and plenty items to chose from. pizza is alway yummy and there salad are good too.Enjoy!
Stephen K.,Las Vegas  NV,165,11,2,6/26/2015,5.0,It was friday night at 5:30pm and the house was packed. Dan the man was our server. His attitude  table awareness and overall service was AWESOME! He very efficient with a packed house and extremely courteous. Besides providing our group of 5 adults and 1 infant with absolute amazing service  he made us feel comfortable and as if we were family. I will definitely be back because of his service. Amazing job Dan  keep up the excellent work!
Kara C.,Las Vegas  NV,126,15,14,10/27/2013,3.0,If I had written a review 6 months ago I'm sure I would have given BJ's 5 stars  however  my last few visits have left somewhat of a bitter taste in my mouth. The food and drinks here are always more than great  but the service which used to be just as good no longer lives up to my expectations. Both of my last visits were on slow nights where we were one of only a handful of tables in the restaurant. Now I work in the service industry so I can understand certain situations but being that our server only had a couple other tables I cannot grasp the fact that he kept disappearing for lengthy periods at a time. When we first arrived he greeted us in a timely manner and brought us our waters. We then ordered an appetizer to share while deciding on our entrees. Almost 20 minutes went by before we saw our appetizer or our server again. He dropped off the appetizer in a hurry  didn't ask if we were ready to order (which we were) and proceeded to disappear again. We were done with our appetizer for 5 minutes before he finally reappeared and took our order. The food was great but we just couldn't understand where he kept disappearing off to. We even had to flag down other servers to get things we needed  like refills for our constantly empty waters (biggest pet peeve).  This experience won't necessarily stop me from returning because as I've mentioned I love the food  but I certainly hope they do something to improve their lacking service.
Camilla W.,Henderson  NV,0,14,,3/27/2016,5.0,We had a super wonderful dining experience on Easter Sunday 2016 when our party was given impeccable service by Nicole B. Can't thank you enough. It was Great!
Christopher B.,Chinatown  Las Vegas  NV,40,37,17,5/11/2014,4.0,Great brunch. Took the family out for Mother's Day and was not disappointed. Planned in another place but line was longer than the unemployment office. Worked out because the food at BJs was awesome. Mimosa was great and actually had champaign in it  usually you get more juice. Anyway kids pancakes where the right portions and fluffy. Only negative and why I only rated four stars is my scramble needed more veggies and bacon  but hey I'm a hard ass! All in all we will be back and I highly recommend the Green Valley BJs.
Girl W.,Las Vegas  NV,13,245,181,1/7/2014,3.0,Eh Its ok. I have been here a few times and barley remember what I ate here. Its a beautiful bar and dining room  but the food just lacks unfortunately. Nothing memorable  savory  or satisfying.My mom got the steak once. Was not cooked how she asked for.Like I said I have been here more than 3 times but nothing really stood out. Its good for groups and taking a girl on a 1st date.
Jaime W.,Henderson  NV,532,195,1005,11/22/2011,2.0,The B in BJ's stands for: Boring  Bad  Boo-boo  Bland and BLAH. I can't decide. The service we had is clearly a 3 star. Our waiter was extra friendly to me which I always welcome. But he also forgot to put in our appetizer order. His saving grace was the fact he kept the drinks coming. Drinks- Cherry Cola Throwbacks. Hot damn those are De-licious! Packed with booze and large amounts of sugar  but it just tastes like a soda fountain Cherry Cola. What an intoxicating treat. Pizza- Margherita Deep Dish add Mushrooms. This pizza wasn't any better than a Red Baron pizza you microwave at home. Nothing about it was memorable or delicious. Dessert- Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter Pazookie. It is what it is. Hot cookie with ice cream. Nothing more  nothing less. Enjoyed by all. Overall BJ's is not remarkable to me and I will not go out of my way to return. I will gladly pay higher prices for MUCH better food elsewhere.
Barry M.,Long Beach  CA,2,5,7,4/7/2016,1.0,We had a large group dining here tonight. Service was mediocre. What really went bad was the bill. We had 23 diners and were charged for 31. The manager (Jamie) insisted that we had contracted for 30. That would have been fine--adjust us down to 30 and we are good right? Well  Jamie insisted on accusing our guests that had dined separately on their own checks of potentially eating at the buffet we were paying for. Not only that but she became unbelievably rude. I would avoid this place at all costs. It's located in a center with many restaurants that are happy to have your business. Go to them instead of this BJ's. At least they are named correctly--because this place blows!
Jill D.,Las Vegas  NV,703,295,940,3/14/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Oh my gosh disappointed. I gave an extra star for service. They aren't really lacking there. I would frequent a BJ's in the Bay Area  excellent!  I can't eat the food here. There is nothing good about it. Avocado egg rolls  very bland and could use a better sauce maybe? He ordered a steak salad took a bite then did not eat it. The only thing half edible was the margarita pizza  which was super small even. It is not even fun to hang out in there. There is just no flavor in the food. I usually order the pazookie which is my favorite. My food was so disappointing I decided to skip the dessert to go somewhere else. When you joke around about going to the closest fast food joint after dinner... It can't be good? Try the restaurant most adjacent that place even is better than this.
Raven-Joie R.,Las Vegas  NV,461,291,157,10/27/2013,5.0,I just love BJ's. It might be the food  the drinks  and the entire atmosphere  but I adore it. The restaurant is usually full at every location  so it doesn't hurt to make a reservation. The Ahi Poke dish is my favorite and that Cheeseburger Pizza really tastes like a burger! The pizookie is super good  I suggest the macadamia one if you like sweets that are not -too- sugary! If you're on a budget  try their lunch menu M-F @ 12-3 pm. I think you'll find that BJ's is better than your average restaurant :)
Nicholas W.,Las Vegas  NV,169,226,195,9/26/2013,2.0,I love the BJ's chain but this restaurant is very hit and miss. I have had some of the worst service in my life at this place. Last winter a group of seven sat down for lunch and it took 30 minutes for the drinks and then another 20 minutes to order. So 50 minutes before we ordered our food. The pizza at this particular BJs is terrible  they put almost no sauce on the bread and over cook it.
Aimee L.,Las Vegas  NV,54,9,1,7/14/2014,5.0,"GREAT DINNER! GOOD SERVICE! Consistent. My boyfriend and I came in for dinner the other night and sat at the bar. The bartender was so nice and so accommodating. We hope they will add ""sweet potato fries"" to the menu soon just because we think it would make a great addition! Who doesn\'t love sweet potato fries? Anyhow  the beers were good and the Black and Bleu Burgers were to die for! Happy with our choice to go to BJ\'s on Eastern. It was a great dinner. PS. Add Sweet Potato Fries to the menu pleasssssse! :)"
George M.,Henderson  NV,0,29,2,7/10/2015,4.0,We like to go to BJs but don't go often enough. The food is always good and the portions are exceptional. The staff is always pleasant in the restaurant is very clean it does get busy and you have to wait but what do you expect when you go to a restaurant this good. Prices are reasonable and the desserts are to die for!
Brian M.,Henderson  NV,246,98,108,5/10/2015,5.0,This place is awesome! We have been here a few different times and have always been satisfied with the food and service! They are great for kids and parties!
Hazem N.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,3,8/18/2014,5.0,Excellent environment  and excellent service. Food is great and they have a good value for money.
Alejandra L.,Henderson  NV,69,15,1,12/13/2014,2.0,"So I decided to come here with some friends to celebrate my birthday. I wish I would have gotten the name of our waiter but it seems like this location has had it\'s share of bad service anyways  Which is really sad due to how satisfied I was with the portions and flavor of the food. Everything was cooked to perfection and not to mention the amazing variety of foods and drinks. Anyways on to the main point: Our waiter was just...weird in the way of how he talked to us and did everything. Its almost as if he felt uncomfortable serving us as he didnt want to look us in the eye and did everything half-assed and handled everything passive-aggressively. I understand that being a waiter is hard especually attending to many people however this particular night was not busy at all. It was my 21st birthday so my friend wanted to buy me a drink  & obviously we had to show I.D.  I knew it was a long shot since I had just gotten my I.D. renewed (i brought the old one and a new temporary one). With that I was declined my drink  which was no big deal  untill it came time to ask the waiter if they did anything for birthdays. In a very mocking and sarcastic tone he said ""Point and laugh at you."". After 15 min he brought out a cookie with ice cream and a candle on top and just handed it to me...no ""Happy Birthday"" or anything else that other places do for your birthday. I\'m not asking for a parade  rather a little enthusiasm. This experience left a bad taste and honestly I\'m very dissapointed. It\'s not that hard to engage your customers and to be nice  like really  it won\'t kill you I promise!"
Jessica S.,Henderson  NV,0,7,5,7/5/2015,1.0,Fish n chips was extremely overcooked  also extremely spicy. I don't mind spicy but on this dish just wasn't good. Manager said the cook probably put it in the wrong fryer. jambalaya had a powder loaded on top of it which ruined it. Broccoli cheddar soup was cold and clumpy. Server was Shanna and she was very nice trying to help me out. Manager definitely should have compensated more for the inconvenience. All she did was take off our dishes (no shit  we didn't eat them.) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Done with this location.
Chad M.,Beatty  NV,0,7,5,8/15/2015,4.0,We enjoy coming here in on Fridays. They have s very large menu to order from. The staff is nice and the food is pretty good. Their beer is very good and the bar is a great place to watch a game and drink a cold one.
Pete C.,Henderson  NV,0,11,,4/10/2016,5.0,Our server was Fernando. I highly recommend you try to sit in his section. He is 5 stars. The food was awesome also. 5 stars. Great beer choices also. I had the tuna poke - very fresh-  and the 4 beer sampler. We eat there about once a month and each time has been great.
Patrick P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,,8/8/2015,5.0,Came here after walking out of Twin Peaks due to a lack of service. Once seated it was about two minutes between getting our drink ordered taken and our drinks being brought to us. Our server Rachel was really attentive and anticipated our needs. We ordered the five meat pizza and it came out very fast for a pizza and tasted great. Overall a great place especially with their happy hour beer prices. Will be back for sure.
Amber H.,Las Vegas  NV,274,308,1065,2/8/2014,4.0,Good food  awesome pazookis. Fireballshots are a bit expensive at like $8 a pop but it is a restaraunt and not a bar. I got the Pink Cadalliac martini and it tasted like no booze was in it. Overall though  the bar has a nice large TV in it which I was able to glance at. Service was pretty good. About a 20 min wait on weekend nights to get sat unless you can find an open spot at the bar.
Nathan B.,North Las Vegas  NV,41,61,27,8/2/2015,4.0,BJ's is a good choice for craft brews as well as having a large menu to chose from if u are indecisive. The small BBQ chicken pizza is excellent along with the watermelon salad!! Great spot for a business lunch!
Caroline J.,Henderson  NV,178,118,42,8/1/2011,4.0,Sometimes it is difficult being gluten-free. I'm not talking about being gluten free to jump on the new diet fad bandwagon; I'm talking about having to eat gluten free or suffering the nauseous  gut wrenching pain of gluten poisoning. So when I had to leave Chicago  which has a plethora of gluten free establishments  to live in Las Vegas I was nervous that I wouldn't have many options that didn't completely empty my wallet and bank account each week.Thankfully  I have found BJ's. I don't know about the rest of their menu  but I've eaten off their gluten free menu and I will continue to do so for a very long time. Do I eat healthy? Sure. Do I workout? Absolutely  6 times a week or more. Does a girl have to start off the meal with a bowl of luscious  cream filled tomato bisque that makes my veins fight to keep unblocked? Yes. Does a girl have to eat some pizza with melty  oozy mozzarella cheese  Italian Sausage  garlic and fresh basil once a month? Darn tootin'. Does a girl have to finish the above meal with a GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CHIP PIZOOKIE?!? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!!Oh that tomato bisque. You creamy souptastic gluten free deliciousness. Your high fat and calorie content would normally make a health nut like me cringe and hide under a table. However  when you come to the table  lightly garnished with parsley  smelling like Mom's tomato soup when I was a kid  I must devour every last bite. I did today. I almost stabbed my fiance with a spoon to get the last drop.You have to understand that there are some restaurants (*cough* Aurelio's *cough*) that seem to think that gluten free means that either we don't really like food or that we don't know what real food should taste like. Some gluten free pizzas have this bland  eerily flaky  bulky pizza crust that can barely brown when cooked let alone withstand pizza sauce  cheese and other ingredients (see above coughing spasm). BJ's makes this amazing thin crust pizza that is perfectly thin  crispy and has garlic and herbs infused in the crust to make me remember why pizza makes my heart sing every time I ate it back in Chicago. The Italian sausage was not as good as Chicago  but it still hit the spot  especially when they drowned the pizza with deliciously melted mozzarella cheese with roasted garlic. As I ate it I forgot that I was gluten free and simply enjoyed my food. Pure comfort.I could go on for pages about that freaking pizookie. You guys  it is a deep dish chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top. When I say ice cream I really should clarify one thing. By the time it gets to the table it isn't completely ice cream anymore because that warm  gooey  rich and downright sinful gluten free cookie melts that simple ice cream and makes dessert something that will haunt me whenever I go to the gym (which is right down the street).One thing: I can't wait for their gluten free menu to grow. Right now they have some soups  salads  pizza and giant stuffed baked potatoes. Don't forget that pizookie too! Maybe some flatbread  hamburgers and a couple other entrees other than a balsamic chicken would be FANTASTIC!!!Service was great. Water never went empty for more than one second  very friendly  patient and knew his gluten free items. His service was flawless  and I could not have felt more comfortable eating there as someone with a major allergy. If I wasn't suffering from a food coma I would go find his name off the receipt  but right now laying in bed with a round  full tummy seems like the perfect way to enjoy the rest of this meal.
Matt W.,Las Vegas  NV,13,10,,6/14/2015,2.0,Caution! Servers autograt parties of 6 or more and don't display the gratuity on your signed copy. We were a party of 6 with 2 kids so we were in a bit of a hurry and didn't look until we got home. We intended to tip 30 percent and our slick server walked with 48! Bad taste by the management.
Benjamin S.,Anaheim  CA,70,14,17,6/6/2014,3.0,Okay so to start things off I ordered the avocado egg rolls which were very good.. It's served with a sweet soy sauce based sauce .. Surprisingly sweet but it really worked well with the egg rolls.. Now about the service .... Employees seem happy and on top of things for the most part.. Our server I believe was relatively new.. She seemed uncomfortable in social interactions.. Our entrees took a good 35 minutes to reach the table .. Which is unacceptable from a chain like Bjs. I get it.. It's Saturday .. But Christ.. Anyway.. I'll come back ..maybe on a Tuesday afternoon though .
Cheri M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,2,1/9/2015,4.0,Went to BJ's on Eastern in Henderson   was great food nice atmosphere. The Atlantic Salmon was amazing. I would recommend BJ's for all to try. Not overly priced either.
Jason H.,Las Vegas  NV,24,67,30,9/14/2014,1.0,To me this is one of the worst places to go. The beer is good and that's about it. I've gone to this location several times and it gets worse every time.First off we were seated handed menus and the server was talking to another and I guess they switched tables. He comes up before we even open our menus and says can I get you guys some drinks  beer or anything. I say sorry we just sat down can you come back in just a minute or two. Well  that turned into 15 minutes. He comes back and we figure ok we should probably place our entire order just in case. About 15 minutes later he brings our drinks. Then 10-15 minutes from then he brings one of our appetizers. Avocado egg rolls. The avocado was almost brown. Not from being cooked  but from sitting. He says that the station that makes the other appetizer is backed up  but he didn't want us to get hungry. After a fee minutes another guy shows up with our ahi crisp  and another avocado egg roll. I say we already have our avocado egg roll  and he says oh ok kind of confused. The ahi was cut into cubes that were Huge  no sesame seeds or any hint of seasoning basically huge chunks of ahi that smelled like warm raw fish. We finished what we could. Dinner wasn't really any better. I really don't want to write any more. Just know that I will never be going here again. The food isn't good. The service isn't good. This place is really not good.
Allison J.,Henderson  NV,491,642,422,7/10/2013,5.0,Sweet Pig Pizza and Chicken Bacon Ranch are two of our favorite items on the menu here. But what I like too is there are occasional specials like during the summer they have an additional BBQ menu. The spinach  arugula and berries salad and the corn fritters are really yummy. As far as family restaurants go  I love this place. My 7 year old adores the pizookies and we always get a booth so she can spread out if necessary. Service has always been good when we've come and as far as chain restaurants go  this and Sammy's Wood Fired Pizza is as good as it gets for us in Las Vegas.
Dave P.,Henderson  NV,1,9,1,5/31/2015,4.0,If you have been to Hooters then you'll enjoy Twin Peaks. This place is what shooters is suppose to be.
Natalie P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,10/26/2014,1.0,"We walked in hoping to find the nascar race  out of six Tvs in the whole restaurant the manager Jamie came over to the front and said ""we can\'t accommodate you."" And that was it  when asking why? She replied ""we only have six satellites and eight games on.."" And that was it. When there were barely any people in the restaurant and the same game was on three Tvs!  we walked over to twin peaks where they changed a TV for us! Now we\'re enjoying our time there watching the race"
Brooke B.,Henderson  NV,8,52,15,3/1/2015,5.0,Pizookie  pizookie  pizookie! Oh  and barbeque chicken salad and California chicken sandwich. Love to meet my husband here for a quick bite and dessert!
Jessica E.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,6/26/2015,5.0,Came in with my Husband and Daughter for the first time after she received a achievement certificate from her school for a free kids meal. Tam was our server and had a great experience! He was efficient  knowledgeable  and friendly. Cost was a concern when we came here  because  like most  we are on a budget  but I was pleasantly surprised how reasonable the menu was. Food was tasty and good proportions. Not over the top. Good craft beer selection on menu with accurate descriptions of what they taste like and food pairings to go with. Very impressed that the manager came over at the end to congratulate my Daughter for her achievement at school and gave her a pin. It shows they care about the community and not just doing the certificate to get more business. Although it worked  because we probably wouldn't have gone there. We will be back! Thank you for the good experience.
David A.,Henderson  NV,154,118,63,1/27/2015,2.0,The food tastes good  but the portions turn out small and I swear I've gotten sick after every time I've eaten here. Not just me  but my mom and my friend both have gotten sick from eating here. The pazookie is amazing but I get nauseous and the runs after I have one every time too. It's disappointing after great tasting food to get sick  but the portions are disappointing enough as well to not bother returning. There's better out there...
Norman K.,Henderson  NV,1,17,3,6/25/2015,4.0,I had a salad wedge and a basic burger. Both were okay. Bun was large. I only ate half.
Lizzy P.,Salt Lake City  Salt Lake City  UT,192,159,18,8/9/2014,4.0,We took the family out for dinner here  because they are close  and we can all get something we can eat (gluten free pizza for me  vegan spaghetti for my vegan kid  beer for the hubby  etc). They were having issues with their pizza oven on the night we came  which resulted in a long  long wait and impatient kids. However  the manager was super nice  and because he realized how difficult waiting for food with hungry kids can be  comped our entire meal  drinks  dessert and all. We were very  very pleased with the service  and will return for sure. Hopefully there won't be any oven issues next time.
Melyssa B.,Las Vegas  NV,96,57,47,12/30/2013,2.0,Ehh..... Defiantly not the greatest food..Our wait was a little over 40 min and the food was not that great. I got the California Chicken it was so bland. Seriously no flavor. The green chilis had no kick to them or flavor. I was highly disappointed. The husband got a steak and steamed veggies. He ordered medium rare and It came out well done.... This place was just not that great overall. Not a place I plan to come back to when I visit Henderson again.
K M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,30,,4/28/2015,2.0,Average food  average service  average atmosphere. Yep  that's about it - the place is average. Just another average big chain restaurant with an Olive Garden personality.....Keep searching.
Michael P.,Las Vegas  NV,40,79,2,6/6/2015,1.0,I have been here at least 5 times and have never had good service. Sorry  but the food isn't good enough to keep me coming back. Tonight was the last straw when I was seated in the patio and sat there for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged by a waiter. I ended up walking out. I was with a party of 3. No waters  nothing.
Ryan M.,Henderson  NV,4,34,,2/28/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Ok so I think i have about had it with this place. Other bj\'s are sooo much better but the service at this one sucks!They have failed miserably like 5 times in a row. The thing is the foods always pretty good and the beer is great. But having to wait 30 minutes for a pitcher of beer or to even see your server is unacceptable. The sweet pig pizza and j. Red beer is great and keep is coming back but maybe not worth it in the end with grimaldis acrossnthe street.... So i went back again (dont ask) and was the same old story....terrible service and people angry all around us. Manager took forever to get to tables who had issues and was a disaster. I flat out asked the server "" why is the service always so bad here""\' it cant be a server issue if its always bad... It has to be a management issue with payroll or terrible training! She only had 5 tables and was not double sat so i really have no clue other than the service always sucks and the food/beer is always good"
Gemini M.,Las Vegas  NV,123,107,209,7/21/2011,4.0,"We were shopping in the area and wanted something cool to drink  also realizing we probably could handle a snack as well. Rather than hop in the car and head somewhere else  we popped in here to check it out.Three words: Small bites menu. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were plentiful and really tasty  with just a hint of spice. The caps were large and generously stuffed.The caprese (mozzarella salad) was OK. Not bad  but just OK. There was something odd about it and I didn\'t care for the parmesan cheese. Let the tomatoes and mozzarella do their thing; something about the extra cheese and the way it was dressed just made it... well  OK.The fried artichokes were a bit heavy for me  but that\'s just personal preference talking. They were crispy on the outside  tender on the inside  and really  really tasty. My guests dug into them with abandon and didn\'t leave a crumb untouched. Very well done.The seared ahi was absolutely perfect. This was really the only dish that was small - four pieces? - but at the price they offer it  it\'s a fabulous little snack and exactly what they portray it to be. The dipping sauce was flavorful  didn\'t seem laden with salt (a very good thing) and had a great little kick to it. Standout little dish.We also had a couple of salads that were really fresh; the flavors of the vegetables and toppings were bright and clean. The ""spicy"" bloody mary wasn\'t; the waitress admitted it was from a mix and that they couldn\'t really do much to it for me. She brought some Tabasco sauce which helped  but as it wasn\'t fresh  it was really just a mix with some vodka and Tabasco. Not horrible (of course I drank it!) but not a good  hand-crafted bloody mary.And  all this for less than $30. It\'s a 3-star (A-OK) place  for sure. The service is what made it a 4 for us. It\'s a chain and it\'s a bit cookie-cutter  but that works here. Definitely a respectable  repeatable dining experience."
Robert Y.,Henderson  NV,858,36,4,2/16/2015,5.0,Chicken sandwich  BJ's pizza  and a double burger hit the spot eveytime. We gotta love us some BJ''s.
Mikey T.,Oxnard  CA,63,11,1,10/14/2014,1.0,I've had a lot of BJs. This by far was the worst BJ I have ever received. The service was slow and not in a good of way. If your going for a birthday dinner  you might be there to see their next birthday. Never again.
Heather H.,Las Vegas  NV,49,21,18,1/23/2015,5.0,I walked in to BJs expecting mediocre service as usual. After a long week at work  I just wanted decent food and a good beer. I have to say I was blown away for the first time here. Paula  our cocktail waitress made my day! Her suggestions were spot on  she was welcoming  and I felt like she cared about our experience. Honestly  I will make sure I sit in her section every time I dine there again. I will be back soon!!!!
S B.,Vallejo  CA,92,138,39,10/1/2015,1.0,Truely hurts my feelings to do this to one of my favorite eateries since claimjumpers but it is what it is ..... My lady friend and i went here especially for pizookie day .ordered appetizers stuff mushrooms calamari and some kind of new hot wings she ordered ... She says her wings were bland and didnt have enough rub on them they brought more rub thee calamari was bland as well even drizzles of lemon juice did not help or assist . No problem mushrooms were fine ..... So now we're awaiting our main course which we both decided on jambalaya   to our surprise both our meals came mines with extra chicken but missing shrimps on both . So waiter gets manager which i believe his name was  kevin  !he comes out and tries to sooth us and to make things better   i guess he had thee kitchen prepare our shrimp which came out 5 minutes later on the side so now we have to toss our shrimp in our meal . At tht time we were kinda done with this establishment so we ask for to go boxes and our dessert   where the waiter informed us we could only get one pizookie per table which prompts me to look at the flyer ..... Which states with a purchase of 9.95 u get a pizookie no where on it does it state one per table i mean did yawl want us to split our party up and sit at the bar to make more of a mess to clean i suppose .at the ens of the day we got 2 but the experience at this location is not worth me coming back all bjs are already miles away from me but i think ill stick with thee one on charleston instead i mean on a 70 dollar bill didnt get a appetizer taken off are anything like seriously bring my shrimp on the side and think that would make thee issue better i seriously doubt it
Olivia R.,Las Vegas  NV,204,39,24,12/21/2014,2.0,"My friend is visiting town from Germany so we decided to try this place out  my roommate is quite a fan of bj\'s and it was my first time. As soon as we sit down the waitress brings our menu\'s  and my friend promptly asks for the beer menu when the server replies with an  ""Are you even old enough?"" I didn\'t pick up on any sarcastic humor there  and to me that is offensive to just assume that he is not of age. It is one thing to ask for id but to blatantly state that she does not think he is of age is another. He then provides for her his german identification card which she has to go approve with the manager. We proceed to order a bowl of soup and a few appetizers to start out with  both were very delicious. Actually one of the better bowls of clam chowder i\'ve had in a while. We then place our order for our food I ordered a small 11"" hand tossed pizza  which i said exactly like that  my roommate orders a chicken club  and our friend orders just some shrimp tacos. 2 out of 3 of the orders come out wrong. My roommate has a very sensitive stomach and her sandwich (chicken club) some how has green chiles on it. Which is not noted on the menu so she promptly asks them to take it off. My order came out as a 9"" DEEP DISH pizza. Which was completely the wrong style of pizza i ordered. Our waitress comes out and says that ""I ordered a small and hand tossed doesn\'t come in small"" so she gave me a deep dish...? The hand tossed does come in an 11in size which is what I said when I ordered so I do not appreciate her trying to blame me for her mistake in the order. I told her I don\'t want it i\'m no longer hungry at this point when she urges me to box the pizza up. The manager comes to the table  and In my experience managers are usually apologetic. However the first thing she says when she comes to our table is ""So whats the problem"". We explained our problem and she ""fixed it"" by taking our orders off the bill. Whatever. Probably won\'t be trying this place again anytime soon."
Casey M.,Henderson  NV,0,16,1,3/1/2015,3.0,I usually really like BJs..it's not my favorite but they do have a few really good items on the menu. One of my favorite things is the tomato bisque. It's to die for! This time  I decided to pick up a pizza from there with my friends. We ordered a pep deep dish pizza online and picked up curbside. Once we got home and started eating  there were different veggies throughout and a piece of pineapple?!? They were sloppy making it. Next time I will just go to Pizza Hut for half the price.
Michael A.,Amarillo  TX,2,66,113,2/23/2014,1.0,Have to say I was very disappointed overall. The place was very noisy; so much so that it was difficult to have a conversation at your own table. Our server was good once she got to us. We waited about ten minutes for her to come by our table. We ordered a large pizza and several sides. The pizza came out about 30 minutes later. It was LUKEWARM at best. The crust on one side was so soggy it was pathetic. The manager was called over. He asked if we wanted another pizza (another 30 minute wait?? Not likely!!) He then left the table with no other comment. The waitress came by and said she would take off the cost of the pizza. It took two tries to get the ticket adjusted. Too many other good pizza places around to give this place another chance. Life is too short!
Melissa G.,Las Vegas  NV,3,9,,3/22/2015,5.0,I love this place! I could eat here at least once a week. They have such a vast menu and I feel that is still haven't tried everything. Love it!
Darla A.,Las Vegas  NV,0,13,2,4/24/2015,5.0,Came in around 5pm and sat at the bar. Greeted by Courtney  the bartender. She was super friendly. She made sure to point out the happy hour specials  and brought our drinks right away. Ordered a shot  which was very generous in size  and food. My husband and I split the California burger and the avocado egg rolls. Both were delicious!! Courtney kept checking on us the entire time and was quick with anything we asked for. We  most definitely  will be back bc of her service.
Raymond B.,Las Vegas  NV,533,229,200,12/16/2010,3.0,Just last night we left the Yuletide and headed out to grab a bite before heading home and BJ's is a good place to grab a bite and maybe a great drink. We walked in and were seated right away but sat for quite some time before ordering. The waitress brought our drinks and then disappeared until our food came out. We ordered the chicken club and an order of potato skins. The potato skins were done well and came with all the necessary fixins.. Cheese  bacon  scallions and a sour cream like sauce. The Chicken Club was perfect  Lightly toasted Garlic Sourdough with chicken breast  bacon  avocado  tomato and lettuce. I really feel bad about this review only being 3 stars because the food was great as usual but the service was far less then lacking.. My water went empty and stayed empty throughout the entire meal  and we had to wait for quite some time for our check to come. With a small meal at BJ's taking an hour and a half I would say there was some sort of hang up or issue with the service.
Jeanette M.,Medina  OH,0,15,,9/13/2015,4.0,Been here a few times. Service was great  my waitress  not sure her name  bc they don't wear name tags or say there name. I'm ok with that. She was nice  honest about her favorites. The restaurant was steady  my drink was refilled regularly without having to ask. Food was good just has potato skins. Sitting by yourself at a restaurant is not always fun. But my waitress was friendly and I felt comfortable.
Jen S.,Las Vegas  NV,156,404,225,12/17/2010,3.0,Stopped after the Black and White Elite event for the after party and some dinner.This is another brewery restaurant chain  similar to Gordon Biersch or even Yard House. They have a large selection of house beers from very light to very dark. There is also a very large selection of non-house beers on tap and in bottles. I didn't drink any beer that night so this review is just for the food and service.Again since this is a chain  so I feel there is nothing special about the food. It is your typical brewpub items such as artichoke dip  potato skins  buffalo wings  pizza  etc. The food wasn't bad by any means  but nothing really stood out. The staff was nice enought to let us partake in late night happy hour specials (2200 to close) 15 minutes early. The specials were $2 off all apps and 1/2 off all the mini sized pizzas.The service was efficient and friendly. My ice tea was refilled frequently even though I wasn't sitting at the bar. Total bill for my mini pizza and chicken fingers was $18 with tax and tip.
Vicki D.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,59,102,42,6/26/2014,4.0,We went here for happy hour. It was pretty busy. We sat in the bar area. There was 5 of is and we squeezed into a table  We ordered drinks. I ordered a Mojito. Some of the other people in my party ordered lemon drop martinis   apple martini and the Irish root beer . That was by far my favorite even though it wasn't on the happy hour menu. It tasted like a root beer float! So good! For appetizers we ordered the flat bread pizza  spinach appetizer dip and pot stickers. Everything was good. Portions were a bit for 5 people to share but they were tasty. Service was good and it wasn't too loud. I will come back again.
Aaron F.,Reno  NV,129,135,36,8/27/2013,3.0,Ok. If you come here  make sure you order the brewed sodas! Delicious and frosty cream soda and root beer for starters makes this a nice hang out. Feeling like some booze? Try a delicious beer from their brewery. My personal favorites? Try the stout and the Jeremiah Red. All these with a pizza is a great way to spend an evening. For dessert make It easy on yourselves and go straight for the Pizookie. Its a giant chocolate chip cookie! Cant go wrong.
Christine R.,Las Vegas  NV,115,31,,9/2/2014,4.0,I have usually gone here for dinner for pizza and beer but this time went during lunch. They have some really good lunch deals and the lunch choices were many. I enjoyed the half flatbread pizza and salad. However  my companions had the pasta lunch special  chicken fingers and fish & chips and all was good. We started off with the Fritos nachos which were surprisingly good. Prices were very reasonable for lunch and will be added to my places to choose from.
Shannon N.,Las Vegas  NV,94,11,,6/18/2014,1.0,We went that for lunch around 2pm. The place was pretty empty  but it still took our waitress 10 minutes to come over and acknowledge us. That is ok  sometimes a waitress has other stuff going on. However  ordered a bison burger and it came out rare. Asked for it to be cooked more and after 40 minutes of waiting  the new burger again came out rare and the salad that comes with it sat under a heat lamp for the 40 minutes. The manager and waitress were unapologetic. Will not eat at this location ever again.
Natalie K.,Las Vegas  NV,337,290,1349,7/29/2013,4.0,Yes please! The ambiance  service and food are all up to par. Deep dish pizza was great  fried artichoke and the mahi mahi were all delish. Service is very personal and managers walk around and ensure quality. Not to mention the extensive beer menu.
Gary W.,Maui  HI,32,50,1,12/24/2015,5.0,Great restuarant! Always had good service  meals delivered timely and hot!  The blackened salmon is great! Always a hit for us!
Steve K.,Las Vegas  NV,676,45,40,9/18/2013,2.0,Went to Bj's  had wine  drinks  salad and dinner.My bill had a mistake which I caught later. Was charged for two wines instead of one.  After waiting on hold for a very long time  manager said she would call me back with a resolution. No call back.
Brittany S.,Las Vegas  NV,1,2,8,3/17/2015,2.0,Ill admit it we continue to eat here every now and then.. the food is okay but mostly because they are open late. The customer service here is just so god awful. That being said not all the servers are bad w4eve maybe had 2 that were awesome. But the hosts are rude and dont seem to care when you walk in the door. The plates  silverware  and glassware is DISGUSTING. I once found some nasty gooey something in my water and when we told the server her response was ill come back for it later  so my advice to you bring your own water/ drink. Check your silverware before eating with it. And lastly make sure you dont have hair in your food because i found a nice long one in the caprese app. Proceed with caution.
Justin R.,San Diego  CA,252,59,8,12/31/2012,4.0,Great place with good employees. Although a chain restaurant  their beer selection is nice  their own brews are not bad at all (Jeremiah Red and Abbey are awesome) and their bartenders are really solid (Tyler and Ashley stand out amongst the team). Plus their happy hour from 4-7pm with half off pizzas (awesome pizzas.....) is a great deal.NOTE: Does NOT brew on site. Everything is shipped in.
Stefanie B.,Henderson  NV,152,1,,3/8/2015,3.0,I'm in the service industry so I was disappointed with the server that took care of us. It was a Sunday night  and although it seemed slightly busy  I didn't like how she rushed us. The server didn't write mine or my sister's order down. Our drinks were empty for a good 15 min and we waited on our food for a good 30 min. Got the food and it was just okay. We didn't get the extra sides of ranch and marina we had asked for either (we probably would have if our server had written down our order). She seemed annoyed of us  I don't know why but she probably felt bad after we tipped 20% (even if she didn't deserve it) and left.
Janelle M.,Las Vegas  NV,177,40,73,6/29/2014,4.0,We like taking the fam here because there's something for everyone. Recently had visitors in town who've never been to a BJ's.  Someone wanted chicken wings  someone wanted pasta  someone wanted to drink  someone wanted a good steak. BJ's came through for everyone. My go-to meal is the rib eye--cooked perfectly. And the pizookies are always a crowd pleaser. Not to mention their beers as well as cocktails and mocktails are delish!
Sandee W.,Henderson  NV,0,40,,7/29/2015,5.0,Went for early dinner...Had wonderful service from Athena....She has waited on us before...Evertime the service is so great....Other waiters should learn from her.....this is why we like to come back.....
Justin G.,Las Vegas  NV,567,254,193,8/9/2012,2.0,They really do try hard at BJ's and I feel like they get that extra star for effort.When it comes to family friendly chain restaurants  BJs is one of the few that I like. Their food  while not of remarkable. is consistent and some dishes don't substitute in fat to make up for flavor. BJ's has been able to really define itself in what is a competitive market segment. Having it's own selection of micro-brewed beers  deep-dish pizzas  and of-course the pazookie set it apart from the likes of Claim Jumper and others. I usually end up coming here almost once a week. The sandwiches and the deep-dish pizza (the Great White and the Mediterranean are awesome) never fail. But what really brings me in is of course the pazookie. It's their signature dessert  just like the cheesecakes at the cheesecake factory. Service is often hit or miss  but unfortunately my last experience was a miss. I came in during happy hour with a couple friends to catch the game. The bar area was pretty barren  no wait at all. We got our seat an the server took our order. Unlike most happy hour patrons  our group ordered pretty much everything. Beers  appetizers  pizza  pazookies  everything. The food was good  but for whatever reason  our server kept rushing. Maybe she was about to get off and wanted this the tip before she clocked out  I don't know. But considering the place was totally empty  I don't get why they would want to turn this table over so fast. Feeling rushed really does ruin the dining experience  especially at a place I go to so often. She brought our check out before the pazookie arrived which is highly unusual. After dessert had arrived the server stopped by to see if we had paid  seeing we that we had not  she stood nearby waiting for us to do so. This made the whole dining experience really AWKWARD.I don't really expect every experience here to be like this  but it was really uncomfortable.
Clara V.,Henderson  NV,0,13,,1/9/2015,3.0,"The food is always very good. Each time I have been to this location our orders were right and cooked well. However service is lacking  which seems to be the theme of their reviews. Waiters just don\'t seem happy to be there or too service oriented. Like they\'re all robots just going through the motions. On one occasion I did ask my server for a red sangria. I was told they only serve specialty sangrias and that the bartender just couldn\'t make that drink for me. Only the drinks on the menu. What? Any bartender with a proper license and training should know how to throw together a simple sangria. If I could do it myself at home  how could a ""professional"" in a well stocked bar not be able to? I will try this location again but it won\'t be first on my list  that\'s for sure."
Matthew B.,Henderson  NV,7,24,6,1/9/2015,5.0,I have been here twice  each time was very satisfying. They have a good list of brews that are made in house  and are very tasty. The food is nicely presented and tastes great. Nice portion sizes as well. This is a good place to bring a business client/friend. Not expensive but a step up from Applebee's etc.
Cerise B.,Las Vegas  NV,45,90,106,11/6/2014,5.0,I ordered a sirloin steak which was a little too overdone but still very good. Our server insisted that I take another one with me because I was already quite full from the delicious artichoke appetizer I had. My husband loved his corn fritters & pizza and our server was top notch! Ask for Athena at the Henderson location.
Brandon C.,Littleton  CO,0,33,12,2/14/2015,4.0,As always the pizookie is delicious! We had the s'mores pb one was awesome!the salmon dish I had on the lighter menu was yum but the faux couscous was over salted and the newer waitress shorted me in change that night but   overall things got worked out and the food and atmosphere are wonderful! We brought two girls under 9 which I would not do again til they are a bit less bouncy! Better for a date night than family dinner- just my opinion!
John V.,Cypress  CA,0,44,25,12/29/2013,5.0,Our waiter Aaron was excellent  one of the best waiters I have ever had. The food and beer is good as expected. I recommend this BJ's as it is not too far front the strip and is a nice break from the strip crazy...
Jason r.,Henderson  NV,505,113,185,9/20/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,This used to be a great place now mediocre. Tonight went there and dined outside. Was seated at a dirty table and server named rick cleaned table with a napkin and was filthy and we made him get a rag. He finally did. We ordered and never was asked if we wanted a drink. Pizza came and was terrible and had to be sent back. Service from Rick was awful and food was terrible. This place has gone down.
Stephanie T.,Henderson  NV,0,9,,2/8/2015,4.0,We went here to celebrate some bdays for my family members. my sis is trying to be healthier and I made her a beautiful fruit and yogurt bday cake. our server was awesome and he put in their fridge for us. great food and prices
D B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,7/6/2015,1.0,Have gone several times. Today was the final visit. Advised the server that I have some dietary needs. He assured me it would be find. Ordered the Sirloin Steak med  it came out rare and cold  ordered a baked potato that came out the color of a brown paper bag  it had to be several days old  it was replaced with another one only a day old (Yuk)  ordered the Roasted Brussel sprouts with no seasoning  they came out with some nasty seasoning and undercooked. Service was mediocre  the food was terrible. Will not be back.
S P.,Henderson  NV,37,42,8,7/22/2015,5.0,Every time I go the food is great and the wait staff is always amazing and so patient and attentive. The shrimp tacos  French dip sandwich and deep dish pizzas are so good!
Matthew L.,Baltimore  MD,979,722,146,8/14/2012,3.0,Interesting brew house in Vegas suburbs. It has a chainy type of feel  but usually has quite a following. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The food is American comfort food. They are tasty  but predictable. The star are the beers. There are too many to count. The place is great for a large group of people.
love lv f.,Henderson  NV,8,162,,11/30/2012,2.0,I come here often with my family for a quick meal that offers something for everyone. Although they do offer something for everyone like all chains  its not always good. Same with the service. Most times its slow  especially if you sit at the stations in the far back. Ordered the lettuce wraps  the filling was all cold and there was little flavor. Even with the sauce added  now I only tasted salt. My husbands salad looked as though the lettuce had been out for sometime  and somehow the chicken fingers did not pass my daughter's tastebuds. Typically I have gotten a decent meal here. It could have been the night  but they were not that crowded. We were immediately seated.However I was surprised though that our server never asked if everything came out ok. I would have probably said something. I'm sure I'll go back and try something different!
Teri W.,Henderson  NV,130,822,389,3/13/2011,4.0,The food here is amazing  as is the beer. My favorite is during the fall when they have the Pumpkin Ale. I love that you can buy growlers of the beer to take home  and the root beer is really good as well. It is great to take home and make your own root beer floats. The service is usually really friendly  but at times it's been kind of slow. I prefer to go and sit in the bar area during happy hour  where they have great drink and food specials. There is something on the menu for everyone. I love the small bites and the pizzas  especially during happy hour when they are half off (in the bar area).
Cameron S.,Las Vegas  NV,118,243,5,4/1/2013,4.0,I always receive a very consistent meal here  whether if I'm in the mood for a salad  pizza or turkey burger. BJ's always is pretty busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Pizookie  which is a giant pie lie chocolate chip cookie fresh from the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top  that in itself is a meal!If you are looking for a more up-scale bar scene but want to escape the slightly higher prices of Yard House  I would recommend BJ's.
Allyson M.,Newbury  NH,37,30,9,5/5/2014,5.0,If you love avocado .. The avocado egg rolls are yummy. The lunch specials are also worth it - flatbread with salad or deep dish with salad! Top off with the crazy dessert that you just can't believe it pizzi- something awesome!
Cynnie N Christopher C.,Henderson  NV,15,12,,11/12/2014,5.0,Always find myself wanting to order the jambalaya  its uber good. Turkey burger is good  pasta bowls are awesome  and the beers are always delish.
Bigg G.,Henderson  NV,0,14,10,10/13/2013,5.0,Always a good time watching football  having a couple craft beers... Pumpkin Spice Ale and Octoberfest!! A very tasteful mix of weather changing aromas and warm flavors. Happy hour - with mini pizzas and other specials going as we watch the morning games. You can never go wrong with the triple chocolate ghirradelli pizookie!!
Kyla G.,San Diego  CA,49,139,16,3/24/2012,4.0,"BJ\'s is a date-night staple for the boyfriend and I. The food is very consistent (I tend to order the same thing every time!). Not gourmet by any means  but tasty. Their new ""Small Plate"" appetizers are awesome and cheap! They also have a low-cal menu section  which is nice  but needs to be expanded. The menu is huge...like Cheesecake Factory huge. Their house brews are great. And the Pizookie is to.die.for. Two people can eat (drinks + entrees) for about $40.Only 4 stars because of the service. It\'s hit-or-miss. Generally  food takes quite a while to arrive. The place can get pretty crowded on weekend nights  but the bar area is open seating with full menu."
Matthew M.,Henderson  NV,10,63,1,6/25/2012,3.0,"Pros*The food was really delicious. Everything we tasted was amazing.*Their beer is pretty decent*Their signature dessert is a giant cookie with ice cream. And the cookie is still hot*The staff was extremely friendlyCons*My entree was 1600 calories. Even taking half of it home still resulted in a mega-portion of fat and sodium (I obviously didn\'t order from the skinny menu)*The Pizookie (dessert cookie) had less fat and calories than my entree. Since when is dessert the \'healthy\' portion of the meal*The timing of our meal was off completely - our appetizer came out just seconds before our entrees and our dessert took another 20 minutes after orderingWe went for a late dinner on a Sunday. The place was busy but not swamped. Our waitress was a trainee and she had her trusty ""pro"" shadowing her. We\'ve all been a trainee before  and I think she did pretty well for a newbie. The issue here is that at a few points during the evening the ""pro"" came over by himself and spoke with us. I think it would be beneficial for the trainee to handle all situations instead of confusing the diners with multiple servers.Somewhere along the way our meal timing got messed up. The appetizer (poke - absolutely delicious) came out less than a minute before our entrees. This led to that awkward situation where you try and eat the app as fast as possible so your meal doesn\'t get cold. The poke was amazing  so not an issue.While we were shoveling tuna into our faces  the manager came over. He profusely apologized for the timing issue and said if we wanted to have a dessert he would pick up the tab on that. Very nice  we thought  but not needed. The timing thing wasn\'t really an issue for us  but it was a really nice gesture on the manager\'s part.Please be warned that it\'s really tough to pick an entree at BJ\'s. Their menu is extensive and everything sounds delicious. The entrees we picked were both fantastic (Chicken Marsala and Tuscan Chicken Limone). If ever there was a restaurant to not be a fat American  BJ\'s is it. Take half home. Their portions are large and should definitely not be consumed in one sitting.Since the manager went out of his way to offer us the dessert  we opted for the peanut butter pizookie. It\'s a warm peanut butter cookie  about 8"" across  with ice cream on top. Everyone has an inner fat girl  and she\'s drooling at the sound of this. And yes  it\'s that good. Ignore the diet  forget about the bathing suit body  just eat the pizookie and enjoy it.Overall  we had a decent experience at BJ\'s. The food is really good  the staff is really friendly  and they seem to genuinely care about making guests happy. The portions are pretty big  and there was definitely some awkward moments created by the staff  but I think we\'ll likely return."
Breanna G.,Southwest  Las Vegas  NV,7,81,4,5/12/2014,5.0,I order take out from here frequently and Jake is the waiter who works takeout during the day; he is the best! He has to be the best employee for customer service and thoroughness I have ran across in a long time. Go here! Order from their low calorie portion of the menu too! The ahi salad and Chinese chicken salads are amazing. And takeout is also one of the best in the city. The presentation is phenomenal  quality amazing  and service top notch.
Sarah P.,Las Vegas  NV,10,58,1,7/21/2012,5.0,"It was the bf\'s birthday celebration... My friend William suggested that we go here. The homemade root beer is DELICIOUS! They have potato skins and really good ranch... But their bacon is not very good...The place was packed... Usually a good sign... The menu is HUGE... The food that is presented is beautiful to the eyes and the stomach... I ordered the calzone... It had artichokes and mushrooms and cheese... They need to use just the heart I kept running into the ""leaves"" of the artichoke and they were pithy.. but it was soo good I ate around them... The marinara sauce that goes with the calzone is mmmmm good! The bf ordered the jambalaya... We were told by at least 3 different servers and a manager that it was ""spicy"" and that made the bf happy! It had chicken...shrimp...and andouille sausage... He loved it! I thought it was too spicy! PORTIONS ARE HUGE! Definitely share meals..."
Randy M.,Honolulu  HI,4,73,12,8/6/2014,3.0,Service just ok. Food was only 3 star  I could have made the California Burger much better myself at home. Had to ask for my beer twice but it was good.
Crocodile Dundee D.,Tonopah  NV,66,40,3,8/5/2014,5.0,Love this place  always busy  if u wanna come eat at night you should come early because you wont find parking anywhere. I ordered the grilled chicken pasta it was very tasty. It came with pasta  grilled chicken  with breadsticks  so good. Always love coming to this place  especially with friends. They also brew their own beer. Better leave some space for the pizookie. They have different ice cream flavors  with baked cookie topped with ice-cream and cherry on top.
Carla C.,Washington  DC,122,51,44,9/2/2012,3.0,I like coming here for free pizookies on peoples' birthdays. Other than that...this place isn't extra special or anything. It's just kind of one of those places you go to because you can. I like their broccoli cheddar soup too though. Its consistency isn't too thick and not too watery. This place is actually really nice during lunch time hours because their lunch menu is reasonably priced and there are a ton of selections. When I was in high school  we used to go here before games and stuff and it was a good go-to because of all the selections. The atmosphere is comfortable and the staff at both west side and henderson locations are always really helpful. Food-wise  it's kind of like better than Denny's?? I like it  but it's not like OMGARSH WE HAS TO GO HERE. Sometimes I crave it  or it's just a place my friends and I can hang.
Sara Q.,Henderson  NV,2,18,,7/9/2013,3.0,I liked the pale ale. It was exactly what you would expect for a micro brewery. Full of flavor.The appetizers were pretty good to. I would recommend the egg rolls.Overall the food was a bit pricey.The service was pretty slow though. It wasn't very busy but it still took really long to get our food.
Maria A.,The Strip  Las Vegas  NV,13,19,17,7/20/2014,3.0,Good food. Staff is attentive and always telling me about new items and specials. The bar is fully stocked and but I especially love the speciality beers. Bartender was great at letting me sample a couple before I made up my mind. Only downside is the place is jammed packed  tables are close to each other. Sometimes I felt like I was shouting at my dinner date.
Kitty R.,Henderson  NV,0,11,,5/19/2016,2.0,It's been awhile since I've been to BJ's on Eastern. So I decided to have lunch Saturday with my little girl. I told the waitress my daughter has food allergies and she should alert the cook. I also asked if there was going to be a problem? She said no. Then 20 mins passed  wasn't sure how much longer it was going to be? The waitress said it shouldn't be long. Our food finally arrived. They didn't modify my daughter's order like they should...I was heated. It took forever and my daughter was hungry. The runner told me there wasn't a allergy alert on the ticket. I asked for a manager. She came and apologized and told me there was a allergy alert on the ticket. Idk who's lying here. The waitress already lied to me about not having a problem. The manager came back 10mins later with the correct order. By then my lunch was cold. I had the chicken with rice pilaf and it didn't taste good. Had a few bites and I was done. Not going back again. Not a place for people with food allergies  the wait time is long  and the food was meh.
Jill B.,Las Vegas  NV,10,12,1,7/17/2014,4.0,Service is always slow at every BJ's I've been to  but this one seemed a little better. Food is always amazing though. Try the eggroll appetizer and crispy jalapeo burger.
David J.,Las Vegas  NV,2,6,1,6/8/2013,1.0,We arrived at 11:00 a.m. and we were greeted immediately  a hostess started to take us to our table in the bar section so we asked to be seated in the dining section instead. The hostess rolled her eyes and rushed us to a booth in the dining section dropping the menus on the table and giving us the 5 second spiel on the drinks and walked off. We immediately complained to the manager who apologized. It would have been a nice gesture if the manager to came check to us to see if the experience had improved...needless to say the whole mood was ruined.This used to be our favorite spot and the first time we ever received such a crappy attitude from a BJ's Brewhouse employee. Glad we used our points on prior visits because we will not be going back...ever.
Lydia N.,Las Vegas  NV,214,209,535,2/23/2012,4.0,I only gave it four stars because of the chocolate chunk pizookie. Sometimes I go to BJs at least two to three times a week just to order the pizookie. I LOVE IT. Other than that  BJs service and food is mediocre.
Rosa R.,Las Vegas  NV,0,16,,10/15/2014,5.0,"I love love this place... food and service is always great! The trio pazoooookie ""YUM"" always hits the spot for a sweet craving.."
Bernadette T.,Henderson  NV,276,28,75,6/15/2014,4.0,Good family restaurant! Celebrated Father's Day here with the family and had a nice meal. They even gave all the fathers a souvenir beer glass.
Kat D.,Miami  FL,230,217,168,11/15/2014,3.0,My boyfriend likes the split screen TV at the bar otherwise we wouldn't come here. Service is always bad  but I'm hesitant on writing terrible reviews. Today however  all 3 bartenders had never heard of Campari. I'm still not sure if they have it  but most bartenders at the very least have heard about it.
Greg K.,Henderson  NV,489,515,685,8/17/2010,3.0,Good news is the huge portions and familiar American cuisine that is easy on the palate and friendly to all food tastes. However  why would anyone want to wait in line for this food is beyond me. Sometimes the lines can be 45 minutes. Do not go there with hungry kids at 5:00 on a Fri/Sat night. You will be distraught over the wait...Otherwise  I enjoyed it overall  but don't plan to go out of my to head back there soon.
Willie B.,Westminster  CO,117,342,381,8/17/2010,3.0,So I'm in Vegas trying to figure out where to eat with my brothers. So my brother Tim suggest BJ'S. I said sure we've never been there before let's try it out. We drove to the place and low and behold we have one in Westminster but I've never been.  There menu is huge with a very wide variety. My family tried the clam chowder bread bowl and the bowl was the best one I've ever eaten. Next we tried the baked Mac n cheese. Again so good  super cheesy packed with bacon bits. For our entree we had deep dish pizza which my wife like but I did not care for.Pretty much enjoyed the whole experience and the food. Had a good time hanging out with family. If you get a chance check out Bj's I think you'll enjoy it very much. much. It's not the best but its not the worst. i cant wait to try the one in westminster co after my trip.
Paveh A.,Chinatown  Las Vegas  NV,255,25,5,9/29/2013,2.0,I was very disappointed in BJ's food. I ordered the French dip sandwich and the runner who brought out the food didn't even notice that she had a empty sauce dish on the plate that the horseradish sauce should have been in. She then tells me to be careful as the plate is hot  which it was not hot at all. The roast beef on my sandwich was very cold like it just came out of the fridge and the cheese was not even melted. I told my server about my sandwich being very cold ( not even room temp) and he took it back. Ten minutes later he brought me another sandwich which wasn't even warm  crazy how bad the preparation and food quality has gotten here. I don't think I will be back as the last few trips to BJ's I have been really unimpressed with the food.
Kristal R.,Las Vegas  NV,127,42,5,12/12/2011,2.0,"A group of us decided to dine at BJs on Dec. 3rd. We get the little buzzer for when your table is ready  and we sit down. First  there was another diner that was sitting on the bench in the ""waiting"" area breastfeeding her baby. Why the restaurant would allow this - I have no idea. But anyhow  we wait for our buzzer to buzz  and low and behold after 15 minutes it\'s buzzing. We go up to the front  they get our menus ready and ask us to stand off to the side. We stand off to the side... for 30 minutes. The hostess tells us literally about 10 times that our table is being cleaned. So why ring the buzzer if it wasn\'t ready the first time? Finally  the hostess takes us out back to our table  and the table is still dirty! What in the world?? So we stand there as she grabs a busser to clean the table. Then we get seated on a wet table.Our waitress comes after a few minutes  and she has this matter-of-fact attitude and doesn\'t even apologize for the mishap which she clearly knew about because she was talking to the hostess who was telling her about it. But anyway  we order our drinks. She comes back and gives everyone the wrong drinks. Everyone on the table just starts handing out the appropriate drinks to the appropriate people on the table. We order our food and wait almost another half an hour for our entrees. The chili was absurdly salty  and it had an alcohol taste to it. Completely inedible. We tell this to the waitress  and she apologizes but does nothing about it. At this point  we conduct ourselves by the dining golden rule to not anger your waitress. We say nothing further. I ordered a 12oz steak - medium. This was the smallest most overcooked steak I have ever had. It was 6oz at the most. It was unbelievable. Underseasoned and lacking from any flavor. I ask the waitress for steak sauce  and she brings it by and just drops it on the table without even looking my way. When we were done with our meal  she comes by and tells us ""if you want desert  you can have red velvet pazookie. It\'s good."" That\'s it? No menu  no other choices? We pay our bill and leave. The quality and service was abysmal at this BJs.You\'re better off going to the one in Centennial or Summerlin."
Candace R.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,26,58,295,11/27/2012,5.0,Chain restaurant but tasty and lots of variety.
breyna c.,Wilmot  NH,3,21,1,1/14/2014,4.0,Yes it's a chain restaurant but the food quality is great I love coming here never disappointed they have the best wings and amazing avocado egg rolls I love the pozzikies (I think that's how you spell it) this place is def my guilty pleasure and the service is great
Dan N.,Pittsburgh  PA,83,110,46,1/5/2014,2.0,Generally  I like BJ's  however during our last visit our beers were warm  service was slow and when we said something to our server she didn't offer to correct any of the issues and we ended up leaving to get dessert elsewhere as we were aggravated with the experience. Not the first time we have had issues with our servers here.
Paolo D.,Las Vegas  NV,805,975,79,6/10/2010,3.0,"Good chain restaurant with good brews. I had their house brand Tempest IPA (not on the menu) and I enjoyed it. Everything we ate was tasty and the service was great. I\'d probably rate this place 3.5 stars  but since I have to choose  I\'m leaning towards ""A-OK"" rather than the 4-star ""I\'m a fan"" option."
Julie R.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,404,22,52,4/16/2014,5.0,I always enjoy eating here. Highly recommend eating their Parmesan crusted chicken & white chocolate macadamia pizooki!
Stefan C.,San Francisco  CA,161,28,4,1/12/2014,5.0,For the price  competitors cannot beat the food and atmosphere of this place.I eat at this location with a group of friends regularly. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and plays along with the stupid things that are sometimes said by our group. I'm not proud of this  but we sometimes stay here for three or four hours until closing time. The staff never seems to have a problem with this either. Kudos to them.The menu is surprisingly extensive  and the food quality is great for the price. I enjoy the salads  and the deep dish pizzas are incredibly tasty. Also  get the Pizookie Party Platter with a small group!At the end of the day  the food is good  but the staff is what makes me give this location five stars. Keep up the good work!
Tony A.,Las Vegas  NV,3,4,,5/18/2014,5.0,Great appetizers and even better beers. If you like pale ales  try the Piranha (It could become your favorite). They have a patio which is key for those of us from California.
Carissa P.,Reno  NV,4,41,22,6/6/2014,2.0,Food is cold  over rated  not fresh and service isn't friendly. Waiters are always rushing you to order. This BJ's on this side of town is awful! Please get better management.
Gordon K.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,8/17/2014,1.0,"Ordered a medium rare burger. Came out well done  sent it back and was told the ""chef"" would be recooking it himself. It then came out around medium well and not a drop of seasoning. My server  Aaron  was terrible. Ran out of soda twice  he never checked to see how things were  we got more service from the hostess. After he finally dropped our bill off it took 10 minutes for him to pick them back up. I used to love this place  looks like they must have a new FOH manager and or new chef. Stay away from this place until they fix the issues. TERRIBLE"
Danielle R.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,1191,879,2795,6/5/2012,4.0,I like this place. They have a HUGE menu  lots of TV's  and the service is fast and friendly.They also have a 'skinny menu' where everything is under 550 calories. PERFECT.I got a grilled chicken and mango salad and it was amazing  been craving it since. They also have a large selection of ice teas if you are into flavored tea!I have now been twice and plan to go again. It's casual like a Chili's or Fridays but with better food.
Shannon S.,Henderson  NV,173,144,44,1/24/2014,4.0,Who doesn't like beer  pizza  and of course giant chocolate chip cookies? No one. BJ's brewery is awesome. It has a nice atmosphere and it is very family-friendly. The food in general is good. I really have never had a horrible meal there. The restaurant is always clean and inviting and they always play the best sports matches. It's loud enough in there to be fun but quite enough to have business meetings and talk with a friend or coworker over a nice meal. To be honest  the only thing I don't like is that there is barely anything on the menu lesson 700 cal. And that does not include the side dishes.
Darcy D.,Henderson  NV,46,21,18,3/11/2014,3.0,Consistent and easy for everyone to find something they like... If you're looking to avoid waiting for a table  open sitting in the bar doesn't seem to be much different with regard to service speed or atmosphere...
Monica W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,18,,4/2/2013,1.0,FOOD= horribleSTAFF= Server was nice & management horriblePRICE= $$Management here really needs a clean up at this location.BEWARE!!!!!!!! My husband and I were sharing the spinach dip and he cracked his tooth on something he spit out everything his tooth shattered and there was chunks of glass in our spinach dip!!!!!We got the manager and he said he would take care of the dip (well I certainly hope so) but we wanted to know how our dip had crushed glass in there!!! Couldn't even finish our dinner since my husbands tooth was shattered and the manager gave the number to their HR department. Basically the manager and the HR lady never got back to us for paying this horrible incident. Never going back to this location.
Bennett L.,San Diego  CA,32,213,240,9/4/2009,4.0,"I\'ve been to BJ\'s restaurants in Eugene and San Diego and this is far and away the best. It\'s casual dining but in a very nice setting. This BJ\'s is new to the area (border of Vegas and Henderson in Silverado Ranch) and has a split level dining hall. The upper level has the bar which has a bitchin\' hd video screen tuned to all kinds of sports including the glorious MLB Network.Service is friendly and the staff is well educated on the huge menu. Seriously  you\'ll really find just about anything when it comes to standard American food. There\'s also a huge beer list of domestics  imports and special brews exclusive to BJ\'s.Here\'s my gluttonous rundown:Oktoberfest beer: I was talked into starting off with the limited edition house beer called Oktoberfest. Good choice.Tomato basil soup: fresh and warm topped with bread pieces. Tasty and simple.Fettucini Alfredo with Blackened Chicken: This entre off the lunch menu was the low point. The pasta was undercooked and a little tough. Garlic bread was too hard. At least the chicken was cooked well.Peanut Butter Piezookie: Im not a religious man but if there\'s a heaven  this must be what they serve. Freshly baked peanut butter cookie topped with two big scoops of vanilla ice cream. Death row inmates should request this for a last meal. Go to BJ\'s for this item alone and you\'ll leave happy.The service was very good. Maybe a little too good. There could have been a few less ""how is everything?"" moments in mid-bite. Maybe they thought I was a critic or something since I took pics of everything. I will hand it to my server who followed me to the parking lot with the keys I forgot at my table.I will definitely be back. This review would be five stars if not for the issues with my entre."
Michele M.,Henderson  NV,91,243,380,3/22/2012,3.0,Service was decent but the place was super busy so it's understandable that the waiter wasn't better. Spinach dip was yummy!
Josh M.,Las Vegas  NV,80,63,,10/2/2011,4.0,The deep dish pizza here is always amazing. I get the BBQ chicken and bacon with extra cilantro on top.....THE BEST!!!!The service is usually sub-par but it's Vegas. Unless you're at a high-end restaurant  you can't expect much.
Oana S.,Las Vegas  NV,204,80,10,7/19/2014,2.0,The food was average  and the service was lacking. I had the salmon and a salad. The salad was good  the salmon was average  and the asparagus was bitter and burned. My friend ordered the beet salad only and the server didn't trouble herself to let me friend know that they were out of the beet salad until my entree arrived. Not cool.
Heather S.,Henderson  NV,0,1,,7/13/2014,1.0,Worst service ever! They are slow for everything drinks  food  etc. When you do finally get your food it is cold! Need new servers and new management. NEVER going again. Poor poor poor.
Marie B.,Henderson  NV,27,110,250,2/11/2014,4.0,Stopped by to have a quick lunch. We ordered chicken quesadilla and pizza. Both were lunch specials. They were both delicious. Yeah  we'll be back. Perhaps for dinner next time.
Keith P.,Henderson  NV,0,8,,7/8/2015,5.0,I've not been to BJ's in a while  and I'm not sure why I stayed away. I just had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and loved them. I'm going back.
Sham M.,Henderson  NV,85,23,1,4/2/2013,4.0,This restaurant has the friendliest of service.Food is of consistent high quality.The only draw back is the noise because of several high volume TVs making conversation difficult.
Jodi J.,Las Vegas  NV,21,28,,3/1/2014,4.0,Great beer and pizza  Chicago style. The Cajun pasta is also really good. And don't forget to order a Pizookie. Proceeds support cystic fibrosis so you don't even have to feel bad about ordering dessert.
Kevin H.,Las Vegas  NV,87,126,6,3/1/2012,4.0,"They have their own microbrews which is pretty cool. I\'ve only tried a couple  but I really really enjoy the harvest hefeweizen.I really only go to this place for beers and clam chowder. There\'s lots of other stuff on the menu  but I haven\'t bothered with it too much. I like the clam chowder so much I feel like I\'m missing out if I try anything else. With that said  I have tried a burger and a pizza here. Both were pretty good if my memory serves me.The clam chowder in a sourdough bowl.  Its good clam chowder; thick without being too thick. The best part is the bread bowl though. They butter the hell out of the ""lid"" and toast it. It\'s amazing. The bread is flakey on the outside and soft on the inside.The service is about average but they do seem to get overwhelmed during happy hour times."
Ed R.,Reno  NV,12,138,,1/25/2012,2.0,Just finished one of the lunch specials called Baracoa Taco's. The tag-line for these was low calories. There was a picture of the plate on a table tent  looked good  went for it. And then  it was served...and luckily I have good vision  or I am afraid I would not have seen them. Tere are three tiny tacos and a bowl of black beens. The tacos were maybe 3 or 4 inches in diameter  and the beans in the picture number likely around 200  and I got maybe 30  covered in bean sauce. They should have placed a quarter on the plate in the picture to give some sense of scale. They could have served an eighth of a hamburger and got away with the same lo-cal claim. Anything reduced to micro size will be lo-cal. As for taste  OK  no better. Ate there a week ago with a friend and had a burger  Average at best.
Rajesh M.,Las Vegas  NV,104,26,5,2/13/2014,3.0,The Food is good. The waiter we had on this particular day wasnt the best they have. We were hungry and the food arrived late. The overall experience isnt something i would want when i go out to eat.
Kevin D.,Henderson  NV,159,125,14,8/20/2013,2.0,What the heck happened? This place used to deliver great value. Our pizza was served cold  the wait staff was either over-taxed or out-to-lunch. Regardless of the promotional discount  I may return  if only for a beer. The pizza is a big miss.
Aaron V.,Anaheim  CA,158,3,,5/1/2014,5.0,The BBQ lunch platter is perfect! Just enough to get my BBQ fix without putting myself into a protein coma. Always get the best service at BJ's- what a great place! The waiter and manager made us feel welcome.
Tyler B.,Henderson  NV,7,62,5,2/9/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,It hurts me to even write this review but I feel like I should at least give a little heads up to someone who might be trying their lunch menu. I had the barbacoa tacos which consist of three super small tacos filled very conservatively and a side of black beans. Flavor was moderate. My GF had the fish tacos which looked normal size and pretty delicious. Sadly the appearance didn't match the taste. When I had a bite it tasted like a frozen fish stick stuck inside of a bland tortilla. Our other friend had the dinner jambalaya and they thought it was really tasty. We had the pizookie trio for dessert and it as always was awesome. As for the service  started off ok but ended pretty bad. We were waiting for our refills and thought it was taking a bit long when we noticed that our waiter was standing back in the servers holding a conversation with his friend. Luckily another waitress came by and pretty much took over our table until he finished his conversation. From what I can tell this is the type of place where it's best just to eat off their dinner menu no matter what. I thought lunch menu meant same quality smaller portions but apparently it means smaller portions and no quality. As for the service I still think there will always be a few bad apples no matter where you go and it seems that I just have bud luck at this location. Probably going to drive across town next time and see if I can better service and order my delicious buffalo chicken pizza and rootbeer.
M W.,Henderson  NV,3,53,39,2/4/2014,5.0,Food is delicious. Great place to take anyone. Family friendly  has a full bar  tv's all over and just about a little bit of everything as far as food. This is one of my favorite spots!
Gregory A.,Las Vegas  NV,45,184,64,1/30/2012,4.0,Good Food  Usually good service...I love the Seared Ahi on the Small bites menu  and the California Club Flatbread pizza.
Anabel B.,Henderson  NV,40,72,20,2/14/2013,1.0,Sorry BJ'S  our last visit has made me decide that we can no longer be friends. Although you do normally serve delicious food  our last visit here during the early evening hours left us wanting more. Our server ignored us for our entire meal  we had to get her attention for more napkins and water (even after she said she'd be back with more water)  and she seemed entirely pre-occupied. We had our 2 year old with us and that  unfortunately  sometimes seems to scare our servers off. Our child was very well-behaved and we ALWAYS clean up after ourselves. Although you are normally an awesome place for happy hour or a dinner for two  please do not ignore your paying customers (and good tippers I might add) just because they have a little one.
Sharon M.,Henderson  NV,678,12,,6/9/2012,5.0,Fabulous.Extremely reasonable. Great culinary selections. Their Pizookies will set you FREE!!!If you ever have a question about what 'service/ should be  BJ's defines it. Anyone I've every escorted here has demanded to return the very next day. Go figure.snapfinger.com/menus/bjs
Kayla W.,Las Vegas  NV,79,151,100,12/20/2011,4.0,We had a group of 17 people when I came to BJ's for the first time ever! We did put in a reservation and they accommodated us very well. I felt like we were at one of those huge tables you see in mansions where only like 1-3 people normally eat at  but we took up all the space ! Our waitress was very tentative and there was never really a drink empty too long before she had a new one. She was super funny too. My food was pretty great. I have a flatbread with bacon and ranch  super good. Everyone else in the group seemed to really enjoy their food. Those next to me had these massive burgers that they scarfed down. I will have to come back when I can get a drink or two because I heard their selection was pretty great  but I was not allowed to cocktail with this group. Overall  I really enjoyed my first time here and will try to be back soon!
Gregory B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,5/10/2014,1.0,"Let me start off by saying that we have come to this location for many years  but this time was our last. The experience here has slowly declined over time. Our previous two visits were an insult to the restaurant business. I  myself  am a server and therefore understand when certain circumstances arise that problems may happen. That being said  our last two visits made me never want to return. We had the same server  Jennifer S.  both times. Her initial approach to the table took exceedingly long both times ( over 15 minutes). Once we got out drink and appetizer order in the waiting only further continued. Drinks took another 15 minutes to come out (soft drinks) and the appetizers never came out at all. Spoke with the manger  he apologized  and said he would make sure everything went more smoothly. He could only compensate so much for the lack of abilities from the server. Once our food came out  she  along with anyone else  besides the manager once  never checked on us again for the remainder of our visit. We decided to give them another chance today  assuming that maybe it was a fluke. However  once we were seated and again started waiting  we knew there was a reason why we didn\'t want to come back. We had the same server as last time. This time  she greater us and it only took ten minutes. Drinks and appetizers came out in another ten  but we were without silverware. Our food came out in another half and hour  but we were still without silver because nobody had checked on us since we received our drinks and appetizers. So now  with salads  appetizers  both untouched because of no silverware  we had more food. Silverware came out when it decided it wanted to apparently. After speaking to the manager again  and explaining the events on this occasion and the last  he apologized and we received silverware. Our server came back once more before the end of the meal  and that was to drop off the bill. We had no refills or boxes until right when we were going to walk out. This being said  the food here is excellent and has always been. Our service  and our server  were the worst I have ever experienced. Every time we would ask for something  which surprisingly wasn\'t that often since she rarely made an appearance at the table  she would say ""thank you"". Even when she forgot something  there was no apology  only a ""thank you"". She obviously doesn\'t care about returning customers or customer service at all for that matter. She is bringing the restaurant down single handedly. I can  in no way  speak for others who she served  but I did hear other tables around us complaining at the same time. We would love to have a reason to come back here  but due to the lack of service quality  follow through from management  and overall poor dining experience  I don\'t know if I will be returning. If you must eat at BJ\'s restaurants  please choose another location at the very least. You will be disappointed if you cone here expecting a nice experience. ""Thank you"""
Lara M.,Austin  TX,207,140,1,4/5/2011,4.0,Went here for a family dinner with the monkeys and friend. BJ's has always been a random craving of mine...when its met...I don't need it again for quite sometime. This was one of those nights that I needed it and might have traded my kids for it (just maybe).We roll in and there was a small wait...no biggie. I situate the kids with their DVD players and my friend grabs two beers from the bar (I had girly cider...I thought I was ordering their homemade berry beer...I guess they don't make it anymore...bummer) and my friend got some sort of IPA...quite good. BZZZZZ...our pager goes off (much to the delight of my kids) and my daughter rips it out of my hand to give it to the hostess (she's a tenacious little bugger).We were sat at a lovely booth (perfect for kids) and decided to get the Ahi Poke to start. It was yummy with wonton chips that kind of reminded me of Sun Chips  big chunks of yellowfin tuna  avocado  cabbage and vinaigrette. All of it was good except for the avocado which could have been a bit more ripe but it was certainly edible.The pizza was next and it was good but it didn't knock my socks off (pepperoni  mushroom  extra cheese and sausage). The stewed tomatoes were excellent but the crust was a bit gooey-er than I remember....nothing a side of ranch couldn't fix. I downed two pieces (no one could ever accuse me of having an eating disorder).Lastly  we were all full but we couldn't leave without trying one of their famous Pizzoki and Creme. They have expanded their pazzoki selection and now offer a trio so you can sample more of what they have to offer. We went for the chocolate chip  Oreo and oatmeal raisin. Holy cow was that tasty. My son very much liked the chocolate chip and Oreo however my daughter just went for the ice cream. All in all I was a very happy camper. The service is fine but nothing to write home about. Will be back when the next craving hits or maybe sooner because they have a gluten-free pizza that my mom can enjoy as well.
Dan P.,Las Vegas  NV,273,162,102,4/25/2011,4.0,"Great food  great beer selection  mediocre brewery. Well  to be fair  we came here after a beer sampling session at Khoury\'s. We had just finished drinking some of the finest beers available in Vegas (and some not available in Vegas). To drink I had the house brown ale. It was sweet  dark  and very malty. There was a strange chemical taste to it as well  perhaps. I tried some of my friend\'s stout  and it was also pretty mediocre. His description of this stout is classic  ""It reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean."" What a great description  ha! However bad the brewery is here  the guest beer selection is amazingly great  and completely makes up for it. If you aren\'t a beer drinker  the food here is worth having too. I had the shrimp pasta  and loved it entirely. It was more dry than typical restaurant pastas  which I loved because the sauces these places use usually get gross after a while. I could eat this pasta all day. It might have been a little over priced  but I didn\'t mind at all. My friend had a big deep dish pizza. I didn\'t try any  but it looked delicious (and he confirmed this for me). We also had the potato skins as an appetizer  and again a huge hit. These were big thick potato chunks with skin  along with bacon and cheese. Yummy. They came with ranch and sour cream sauces.A little expensive  and the house brewery didn\'t impress me (as a craft beer drinker)  but the guest beer selection was great. The food was definitely top notch for a hipster type restaurant. I\'d go again!"
Jennie C.,Hercules  CA,15,155,162,11/18/2013,5.0,I've been to a bunch of BJ's in California...and I like consistency. I was looking forward to a gluten free pizza and a gluten free pizzookie and that's exactly what I got...the best part was the service with a smile from Jennifer. I would definitely return to this location. Great gluten free pizza and dessert...yum yum...oh and the house-made root beer is not to be missed.
Melissa R.,Las Vegas  NV,529,99,78,12/20/2010,4.0,Hmm  I can't say too much about this place because I came in a bit tipsy ;POther than the good atmosphere and good seating area  this place is great for watching the games.I've tried a sip of black velvet from a friend  and I must say  it's the best I've tried by far...
Jimmy W.,North Las Vegas  NV,10,107,104,12/3/2013,4.0,Lunch crowd was very busy but the bar has open tables and booths. Nice menu selection and good weekday deals. I had lunch special half California chicken sandwich  soup  and fries for $7.99. Tuesdays is half off all wine by the glass and bottle so I also took advantage of that! Nothing really special but over all good service  good atmosphere and make sure to take a look at their daily specials.
Kim F.,Henderson  NV,47,9,1,7/14/2013,2.0,I ordered the top sirloin medium rare. When I cut into it I discovered it was well done! A server did not come around until 15 minutes later. By then I had decided to try it. Dry and tough!!!! The server ask if I wanted another  but my friends were almost done with their meal. So I just told her I was very disappointed and did not finish the steak. No compensation was made. I guess BJ's us just not a place for steak. Very disappointing.
Michell M.,Irvine  CA,58,16,9,1/22/2011,4.0,I love their deep dish pizzas and pizookies - their signatures! This place can get busy  but wait times aren't too long. Also  the servers and whole staff are very friendly. I did order take-out last week and my order was wrong. I'm a vegetarian  so part of my order was a vegetarian mini; however  we got 2 BJ's Favorite minis. It was a hassle that we had to go back to get my vegetarian pizza  but at least they upgraded it to a small without charging. My friend got to keep the second BJ's Favorite mini  too. My only disappointment was that the hostess/cashier claimed that she checked the pizzas to make sure they were the correct ones  but the meat was quite OBVIOUS and couldn't be mistaken. We are human and everyone makes mistakes  but please do not lie to me. Especially to my face.Well... I do not hold grudges  so 4 stars! :)
Alyssa H.,Las Vegas  NV,154,40,25,6/17/2014,2.0,Food is okay  staff is nice  the ambiance is nice  wait time for the food is NOT acceptable. My boyfriend and I were running errands in the area and have passed by this restaurant multiple times and always talked about wanting to try it out. We figured it was happy hour  so why not. We decided to sit in the bar area and to my surprise there were children running in between the tables and chairs! First off  I don't see how some parents let their children run around like crazy in a restaurant. Second off  are they even allowed in the bar area? Anyway  we put our food and drink orders in. We ordered the crispy calamari  avocado egg rolls  chicken lettuce wraps  and boneless wings. We watched the soccer game while we waited (Russia vs Korea). They have a nice huge tv screen right above the bar  so seems like a good place to watch sports. We were both really hungry and ended up waiting OVER 30 minutes for anything to come to our table. Really? Over half an hour for food that are considered appetizers? Thank goodness we didn't order any entrees because who knows how long that would've taken. Of the four dishes we ordered  the avocado egg rolls were the only thing that really stuck to me. Everything else was okay. We moved onto dessert  my favorite part of any meal. We decided to go with the peach and candied pecan cobbler  which was very delicious  but ended up waiting another 20 minutes. Overall  it was just okay. Will I come back? Probably only for the avocado egg rolls and cobbler.
David S.,Las Vegas  NV,572,1049,274,3/25/2011,3.0,It has been a while since I have been here. I remember fond memories of this place  but this time around  I am beginning to wonder why. On several occasions I was told to go for the happy hour because they are suppose to be one of the best. With a dollar discount off of appetizers  I cannot say I am too impressed. Alcohol is not that cheap either; beers range around five dollars  dollar off of certain mixed drinks  and $4.25 for well drinks. I can think of many places that offer better deals. We started with a platter of potato skins  which were made perfectly. They were golden brown and remand crunchy even as we slowly ate them throughout the two hours we sat there. The sampler seared ahi is just that  a small taste  so do not expect a lot. The real savings is if you decide to do the individual pizzas because they are half off. The pleasant memories of this deep dish pie is nothing close to the past. I got the BBQ chicken pizza. The crust was mediocre. It had a crisp edge  but the center was too doughy. I usually can tolerate Chicago style. but the lack of sauce and dryness of the chicken made everything difficult to get down. My friends ordered the mac & cheese  a bacon cheeseburger  and a chili cheeseburger. They were all satisfied with their orders. The chili cheeseburger took ten minutes longer than everything else. We were shocked by how many people apologized for the delay and the manager even stopped by to tell us that the burger would be comp. Even though we didn't think too much about it  this gesture was really impressive. As one friend recounted her disappointment with the pizza the last time she came  I should have took it as a hint to not order it and go with something else. We ended our dining experience with a chocolate chip pazookie. The cookie was a bit on the raw side  but I didn't mind it. Eating cookie dough was always a bad habit I had as a child. With two heaping scoops of ice cream  it disappeared fast.
Robert W.,Pleasant Grove  UT,40,20,,1/4/2012,4.0,"BJ\'s Henderson has really very good food  lots of variety  well trained staff and is apparently well run. Many Yelp reviews indicate a successful dining experience is very likely here. Somebody may have had a less quality experience  but ours was VERY GOOD! Those less than good results may be ""an off night"" or just bad luck  I can\'t say  what we saw and experienced was all positive. Judy was our server  perfectly attentive with sound recommendations. I would  and will come back without any hesitation."
Crystal S.,Albuquerque  NM,4,5,,4/16/2014,2.0,The food was okay at best. Service was not very good. The only gluten free option was a pizza.
Melissa C.,Henderson  NV,6,7,,8/1/2013,4.0,Extensive menu  above average food  decent beer selection.
Tien N.,Las Vegas  NV,25,307,26,12/16/2010,4.0,Went here after an Elite event via the recommendation of Ken M. Wow Beers and Booze took up most of the menu.Great happy hour prices  half of on mini sized pizzas both in the deep dish and flat bread types.Quite impressed with their buffalo pizza  had large chunks of chicken  enough heat to be satisfying but not too much to leave your mouth blazing. The Mediterranean pizza was equally as satisfying. Wide selection of beers. Lots of beers. Beers everywhere. Enough of a selection to shame myself as i have almost no knowledge of these other brews and stick to main stream replicas. For shame i know...
Tarence F.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,86,8,,12/26/2013,4.0,I love the customer here  it's kind of slow but overall it's great. Terry the handle an issue I had with an take out order that really made my day.
Ursula U.,Las Vegas  NV,118,257,3298,1/2/2011,2.0,Now I normally like this place but my last visit here was in a word - Yuck!!We went around 8:30pm- we noramlly eat lunch here so I don't know if at dinnertime the cooks are just too tired or what? Anyways  Our appetizer was Fried Calamari and it was not good at all and oh so cold. This should have been hot but we were so hungry that we dug in and we shouldn't have our tummies paid the price later...That was another thing there wasn't many people in here(Thursday night) but the service was so slow. Fish Tacos- Horrible  the BF took one bite and it was cold inside the fried fish- the guacamole was sour- so this dish was sent back and Tomato Soup was ordered....Chili in Bread Bowl- Chili had a bitter taste to it  almost like Raid. Now I have gotten this before and enjoyed it so I know how this dish should taste here when it's good.Clam Chowder in Bread Bowl- My daughter enjoyed this dish and actually the rest of us ate this too as we were waiting for our meal replacements....My Orange Cream Soda was good as usual but I was just so surprised at the outcome of the rest of the food  very disappointed to say the least!!I must say that even though the food sucked and the service was hella slow our waitress when around was very nice and accomodating.I am not going to say that I'm never coming back here but I'll just count this evening as an off visit for whatever reason and hopfully I'll never have to experience that again or anyone else for that matter....
Khatherine G.,Las Vegas  NV,283,146,597,10/23/2010,5.0,I am actually very fond of this place.My best friend and I come in to dine as often as we can.BJ's definitely has that very loud and social environment. We were seated very quickly and the first thing I noticed on the menu was definitely that half of it was about alcohol. I was not looking there so I cannot review on that part! Haha. There menu is quite extensive with a wide variety so anyone will find something they are looking for.We started off with mozzarella sticks which very great but I wish they would include more dipping sauce. We decided to split a classic angus burger which turned out fantastic and it was very juicy. We also opted for the thin sliced fries and they were crunchy and fantastic.Our drinks were refilled very quickly since she gave them a little hint by putting her empty glass near the edge of the table. Our server was very nice and kept coming back to check up on us.The dessert! Order the pizookie xD They are AMAZING!One of the times I went with my boyfriend  I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and that came out positively delightful. I could not finish it so I had to ask for a to-go box  haha. He had the miso salmon which tasted amazing but he did wish there was more rice for it. This place will definitely stay in my favorites.
Jennifer D.,Ocoee  FL,29,23,2,11/13/2013,4.0,We sat at the bar. Service was good and food was excellent! The light beer on tap actually had some flavor.
Lori H.,Las Vegas  NV,58,26,2,11/8/2010,2.0,I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because the food is pretty darn good when they get the order right. I've been to this BJ's about 7 times and each time (except once) they have failed to give me what I ordered on the first try. I always come in with a group of people from work and we fax our order in before we get there. The kitchen has our order  in writing  right in front of them and still can't execute it properly. I know a veggie pizza with no cheese is a terribly complicated concept but come on! EVERY TIME! I've gotten it delivered with cheese and I've even gotten it delivered without the cheese but with sausage added! Sausage?!The wait staff is always apologetic but the kitchen here seems to be inept.
Ernesto R.,Albuquerque  NM,131,193,178,1/23/2011,4.0,We have been to BJ's twice since this place has been open on Eastern. I know it's been open for a while. Every time we want to go to this place we try to just walk in but there is always a wait on the weekends. not just a little wait  a good 40 minute wait. so we end up going somewhere else. This time I thought to call ahead and put our name on the list. I highly recommend doing this if you are going to go on the weekend. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. There are different sizes. I asked the waitress what difference between the mini and small pizza was. She said the mini was more individual and the small was about a little bigger. She recommended ordering the small because I said I was hungry. The buffalo chicken pizza was great. It is a deep dish pizza that includes two of my favorite foods (Buffalo chicken wings & Pizza.) I also ordered a nutty brewnette pint because this is a brew house. It was ok  not great. It is a brown ale similar to new castle. New castle is a lot tastier. If you like hand crafted brews and pizza this is a cool place to go.
Blair B.,Tyler  TX,354,772,10,9/13/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I wish there was a fabulous locals bar in Henderson with consistent affordable food for me to show some love for  but honestly I have yet to find one as good as BJ's ! Some updated reasons why I love this place:*Happy Hour pricing during all football games*They make a light (135 calorie/pint) beer in house that doesn't suck*Ahi Tuna poke. No it's not as good as Poke express  but this is a bar and it's $5.55 during HH and is served with lots of beautiful green avocado ! Shockingly fresh and tasty for a chain.*They now offer brunch! They open at 10 AM for the early games and have a lengthy brunch menu including breakfast pizza and captain crunch french toast . *Great football viewing in the bar area. 6 games on at once  perfect visibility  HUGE screen. PT's can't touch this place for football watching.*No gaming  no smoking*Huge menu Sadly  it's just a corporate chain  but they are consistent  cheap  and great for football watching. Hard to beat that combination !
Christie B.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,24,72,3,3/1/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Even with all the other places to chose from  when I want a good draft beer and good food  I go to BJ's. Tonight I had the belgian Grand Cru draft and the Parmesan crusted chicken. Their beer prices are some of the best in town  especially if you make it during lunch or happy hour. The Parmesan crusted chicken came ($13.95)with excitement and accolades from the bartender  so I decided to give it a try. It was wonderful and comparable quality to many high-end restaurants. This meal was seriously amazing and I would order it again tomorrow. The bartenders are great  the beer is great  and the food is great! We always have friendly service and get our money's worth every time we visit.
Sun M.,Las Vegas  NV,23,26,15,12/16/2010,4.0,Lots of Beer selections...hard to pick one...They're pizza was good and happy hour deal was pretty good  too.You can create your own pizza. The Mediterranean pizza was good. It looks like chicago deep pan pizza but taste much better.Appetizer was good....potsticker and spinich & artichoke dip with chips was yum...
Christine N.,Las Vegas  NV,163,138,3,10/27/2010,3.0,I really dig this bar. But I am not about expensive. So I usually only come here for happy hour or for special ocassions. I want to re-phrase the expensive comment. It isnt expensive per-se. But I wouldnt pay their regular bar prices.My favorite dish is their grilled chicken pasta. I am not a HUGE pasta fan  but I love this. I also really like their Pazookies (specifically the oreo)The place is a good size  good amount of TVs (for the sports fans)  and a good place for birthday parties and such. I havent had a problem with staff  and they are usually pretty nice. Nothing really that separates them from other bars I have been to (other than the pazookie)  but I wouldnt drive out of my way for it
Rachel C.,Las Vegas  NV,4,24,5,1/14/2013,3.0,I think this is place is SO SO DARK. well the food is ok. Though it is little pricy compare to the quality. I would go back to try different menu. Maybe i will find something i love. =)
Joann D.,Las Vegas  NV,349,4,18,1/8/2014,5.0,I am always surprised at how good the food is at this restaurant. They also will give you a baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top for a birthday celebration. You can watch your favorite football games while you enjoy your food. The place is clean and the people are friendly !!!!!
Odie O.,San Diego  CA,2,998,63,5/13/2011,4.0,This BJ's is awesome as its huge and modern like a vegas hotel  bar is all lit up like THE HOTEL and garage roll up doors are cool. Service was fabulous and their food pretty good. Tasty mac and cheese  good ceasar salad  calamari was crisp and their orange juice was freshly squeezed and sweet. Their avacado rolls had too much eggroll wrap though so they were chewy and skin uncooked instead of crispy like they make them at cheesecake factory so we didnt bother to finish them.
Melissa F.,Henderson  NV,9,8,10,11/30/2010,4.0,BJ's is a large scale brewhouse and has the usual bar menu. The one dish that sets it apart and keeps me coming back has got to be  Avocado Spring Rolls! Delicious  warm  a joy to eat. I swear to god  the 2nd time I had these was better then the first. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5?? Well  the first time I went with a friend  we tried one of the microbrews. It was so flavorless and tasted as if it had been tapped a years before completion. Anyway  I stick to the beers I know and love  same with the food :-)
Crystal M.,Las Vegas  NV,28,24,1,8/19/2013,5.0,Had an amazing lunch! We had the best waitress  Jennifer gets 5 stars!
A C.,La Quinta  CA,180,142,246,6/4/2013,2.0,Food wasn't amazing  service was very slow and inattentive. Staff is very young  they should do a bit more training to get to reach better professionalism.
Dee P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,12,,1/27/2015,5.0,I find this restaurant to have delicious food and a good ambiance. The service has never disappointed me throughout the many times I have eaten at the establishment. I find that the menu has many options  yet anything I have ever ordered comes out in perfect order and taste. The Parmesan crusted chicken is a family favorite. The portions are good-sized and no one has ever left hungry. The prices are a bit high in some cases  but the overall experience and good food make it worth spending a few extra dollars.
rickilane b.,New Orleans  LA,121,58,24,7/29/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I hate myself for loving you! Once again a chain has stolen my heart and kept me coming back. They don't do anything remarkable they just do it remarkably well. The staff is always great and fun  even when it's busy they are on point and always make it look easy. The food is never getting a James Beard award but it's really solid every trip. I am such a chain whore when did this happen?????
David C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,1/23/2015,5.0,Paula from Staten Island was our server and took care of us . She was a pleasure to talk to and made the night more enjoyable.
ERIC H.,Las Vegas  NV,49,9,5,8/17/2013,3.0,I love this restaurant and the food is great. But the SERVICE is terrible. You guys are a busy place hire more employees.  It's terrible you get your appetizers before your drinks. After our meal all of our dirty plates are still on the table. Bad bad bad
Walter S.,Henderson  NV,5,32,5,10/4/2010,3.0,"BJ\'s has a nice open layout and a good atmosphere  especially if you like sports. There\'s many TV\'s around and a bar area where there\'s a big variety of beers and drinks. As I don\'t drink  smoke or like sports I won\'t comment on these.I decided to try BJ\'s for their deep dish pizza which is advertised as Chicago style and has received positive praise so far.The appetizers were quite good and not very heavy.The pizza reminded me of Uno\'s  though not quite as good:It wasn\'t real Chicago style in that the crust was relatively thick. It was more Pizza Hut pan pizza than Chicago style. The sauce was not on top as per Chicago tradition but it tasted great  as tangy as it should be. The other ingredients tasted fresh also. The crust was relatively generic  it was baked pretty good and was crispy on the outside but didn\'t much taste and was too thick to be true Chicago style. Greasiness factor was slightly above average. A small pizza can easily feed 1 person with a big appetite.So for the pizza  As Chicago style: 2/5.As ""generic deep dish pan pizza"" Pizza Hut style: 5/5  (much better than Pizza Hut\'s)Service was just adequate. Servers weren\'t really attentive  they catered mostly to the people at the bar and only visited my table once after they served our order.When I went to BJ\'s I wasn\'t aware of any big game on the TV but the people at the table next to me were shouting and cursing when they got excited (as did 2 other tables plus plenty of people in the bar area) every 3 minutes or so. I\'m not a sports fan so I don\'t care about sports events but it appears this place is more of sports bar than a restaurant. Prepare to be annoyed by noises and shouting.Overall I\'d give this 2.5/5 (rounded to 3 because the pizza was good  not Chicago style though)."
Paul H.,Las Vegas  NV,329,548,656,11/2/2012,2.0,Had a deep dish cheese and chicken pizza that was great. Service was horrible from the seating to the server.
George V.,Lake Forest  CA,7,3,,10/9/2014,5.0,So no complaints here my mini pizza came out quickly  my beer is cold  and the bartender is pretty friendly. I can't ask for much more. I'm glad I drove over here cause it's just like being at the one back home. This is the fourth or fifth one I have gone to away from home and each time I'm glad I searched for one it is really nice that it's consistent. Elizabeth has taken great care of me so far thanks for making me feel like I'm back home in California.
Michelle K.,Henderson  NV,1,5,,1/14/2015,1.0,Bad! Bad service  bad food. Sucked up hair through the straw of my water! Ordered a beer with the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. Waiter disappeared and brought the warm draft beer 30 minutes later and still charged me for it! The yogurt sauce in the pita tacos was curdled and sour! Had the waiter take it off the bill. Manager asked if I wanted another order? ARE YOU KIDDING?! Shove it in your Pizookie!!
Kacy T.,Henderson  NV,88,20,,6/17/2012,3.0,Just had fathers day lunch and everything was great. Kids meals came quick to keep them occupied and the server gave my husband a BJs pint glass as a fathers day gift. Great food and a nice family atmosphere.
Sherita S.,Henderson  NV,42,43,5,12/1/2010,4.0,WHAT A NAME FOR A RESTERAUNT! anywho BJ'S(lol) has the best selection of soups! the TOMATO BISQUE is awesome  although today @ lunch we ordered brocolli/cheese & clam chowder! My friend Sandy & I filled up on the ROTINI chicken pasta & italian chopped salad! we couldnt believe the bill was only 22 bucks. BJ'S is my kind of place  minus the dirty title!
B M.,Eastside  Las Vegas  NV,57,161,28,4/9/2013,4.0,Buffalo Chicken Pizza is a must and the poke salad is a great surprise!
Devin S.,Las Vegas  NV,1,2,,12/14/2013,2.0,Had to wait 25 minutes to eat  which isn't a big deal  but my girlfriend and I were forgot about and skipped multiple times. Also the hostess had an attitude about it... We were sat with no silver wear. How am I supposed to eat my food  man? Good pizza  but a D- for the customer service. I'm sure there's a BJs somewhere else in town that can do you better.
Mark B.,Henderson  NV,6,12,,10/29/2012,4.0,This is a good spot if you are in to having a lot of options when you order. I am a fan of the pizza and burgers. Those that know me  know that isn't much of a stretch. I am not generally an adventurous eater  but if you are  this is well worth it. There are enough pizza options to make you think you're eating at a pizza joint  and enough burger options to make you feel like they hate chick fil a. Either way  its a good call. If you enjoy an adult beverage  their beer selection is large  and if you cannot decide they will offer shot glass samplers to whet your palate. The service was efficient and friendly. On a side note they also make their own root beer which you can view in a large vat in the back of the restaurant. Just a little fun fact. Give this place a shot  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Alfonso P.,South San Francisco  CA,35,50,40,3/31/2013,5.0,Have went to the one in San Bruno a lot an now over here in Las Vegas during my spring. Better than what I had Saturday with a badly cooked steak. But anyways the dish that I love the most is the Tuscan chicken loume (sorry for any typos) it's is a citrus lemony light delight. I love the balance of flavor although I'd recommend that you don't feed it to some kids as there taste buds are still developing which might make them not like but yet it's a good why for them to try something new. I'd give these Resturant's a 5 star rating because of their great attention to detail and nice customer service. Definitely coming back as usual.
Cousin B.,Henderson  NV,1,10,,6/24/2013,2.0,"Seemed like a fun place  cool decor and great beer selection  but a few minutes into the enormous menu and the chain restaurant feel took over. The deep dish pizza tasted a bit like Pizza Hut which was disappointing  and they ""ran out"" of tomatoes for my wife\'s pizza  (no tomatoes at a pizza place  huh?) Consider it a classy Applebee\'s and check your expectations at the door. There are better Pizza options in Henderson and drinking around a bunch of kids isn\'t cool. Doubtful I\'ll return."
Mike U.,Akron  OH,8,15,,6/24/2013,3.0,If Cheesecake Factory and TGIFridays mated and had a baby...this place is it. But some eclectic menu choices (watermelon and arugula salad) some great looking deep dish pizzas and a huge liquor selection make this a viable option for families w a wide variety of tastes.
John H.,Las Vegas  NV,6,77,7,8/17/2014,1.0,I went there today for brunch. There was a crowd of people in the lobby and all the tables were still empty. I ordered pancakes short stack it came out with three little pancakes that look more like they were a side order then an actual order. It literally came with a half a teaspoon of butter and about 2 tablespoons of syrup. My first bite of the pancakes the bottom one was burn so I figured I would eat the top 2 and just not complain. My next bike I got a mouth full of onion flavored pancakes obviously no one cleaned the grill it was disgusting. The manager came over and offered to remake them. I said no thank you as my friends were done eating and wanted to leave. She removed it from the bill but still charged me for my iced tea.. This is a very nice looking restaurant with awful food I will never ever eat at BJs again it's disgusting I wouldn't spend my money here. I have had their pizza in the past... Go to Pizza Hut it's better and much cheaper
Adam A.,Las Vegas  NV,36,8,1,8/15/2013,5.0,Excellent atmosphere. Restaurant is tidy and welcoming. Server was knowledgeable and helped with every selection along the way. The Mediterranean Pizza was exquisite and had ingredients that are lacking in most other imitators. Many craft beers and the Brewhouse Blond fit my palate perfectly  as I tend to favor the lighter varieties. No complaints whatsoever  and I look forward to visiting this location again.
Bob L.,Las Vegas  NV,0,41,2,8/5/2012,1.0,Handicapped unfriendly . The non-bar eating areas are all down several steps from the entrance level. This typically wouldn't be a problem except at BJ's. The ADA required ramp is at the BACK of the building and the only way to get there is through the long  crowded and furniture-filled bar. Impossible to navigate with a wheelchair or walker most of the time.If you can't handle stairs  stay away from this place.
Derek F.,Las Vegas  NV,10,11,,9/2/2014,4.0,"So lunch time rolls around  and I get told  ""Hey  we are going to BJ\'s."" So at first I thought they were talking about a buddy of mine named BJ lol. Turned out it was this place :) All in all this place was pretty dang good. I got the fish and chips. Nothing super special but they were just how fish and chips should be. Had a go at the Octoberfest brew and I liked it; nice full flavored beer. So I would have to say  I am a fan."
Valerie P.,San Antonio  TX,1,57,2,10/1/2014,3.0,I love their food and I've gone to quite a few BJ's around Las Vegas and this was my first time here and wow our service was so slow  i mean the waiter just brings the food so the kitchen was probably behind but we waited over 30 min for our food  although our server Maggie was amazing  she was friendly and was nice to update on the food status. Overall not bad.
Natasha G.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,1,11/8/2014,3.0,Okay  so my rating may say A-OK but that is only because I'm giving it an average rating of all of my combined experiences. Honestly  I haven't been to this BJ's location since my birthday 2 1/2 years ago  which was an absolutely horrific experience. This evening I decided to give it another go  since it's so close to home  well thankfully  this experience was like night and day  in comparison to 2 years ago. Vicki was my server; she was friendly  my order was correct  and has ensured I will return to this location sooner rather than later (but only if I get to sit in her service section.)
Chris M.,Henderson  NV,0,4,,11/6/2014,1.0,My husband and I stopped at BJ's on Eastern for what we thought would be a nice dinner. I have eaten at the one in Summerlin and really liked it. I was so disappointed at the customer service. We were seated after about 10 minutes. Then 20 minutes passed and we were never even acknowledged by anyone! 3 sets of customers sat in our aisle after us and all had their drinks and orders in. I have no idea how they could ignore a table.The wait staff was congregated at the restroom entrance  no sense of customer service. I spoke with the Manager and all he did was apologize. We walked out. THE WORST service ever!!!
Jessica H.,Las Vegas  NV,103,89,35,12/11/2012,4.0,Love this place and the location always great food and I have never had a complaint!
jo j.,Carlsbad  CA,11,75,,4/11/2010,3.0,"Went for dinner on a Sunday night. Friend had gift certificate  or I probably would not really go out of my way to visit a fun 90\'s style ""brewpub/eatery"".We were seated promptly and the interior was cavernous  nice  and not overly loud  despite being nearly full.Appetizers: Our party ordered chicken wings for an appetizer. Sauces were excellent and wings had good flavor. The wings themselves were somehow undercooked. The meat was done  but the skin wasn\'t crispy and the insides had too much fat.Meals: 1 BJ\'s burger ordered rare & delivered... rare - good job. Flavor was good but the burger could have used some additional toppings (or at least ask me ""do you need anything to adorn that plain-looking burger?"") 2 fish tacos - these were pretty good per the diners. 1 club sandwich - also good. Drinks: Great selection of drinks and our party sampled the porter  a crisp apple cider  and the BJ\'s-brewed root beer  among other beverages.Dessert: Pozzati. Chocolate ice cream on a brownie-cookie served in a little pan warm. Very good. Not what we ordered  but tasty.Service: got a trainee+trainer combo who did make some mistakes that were not caught by the trainer. Drinks sat empty for long stretches of time while these two talked earnestly about 20 feet away  never glancing at their tables. Also  wrong dessert was brought by rookie - o well  it was good!I don\'t love the genre  so reviewer bias is admittedly costing this place part of a star just because it\'s another brewpub with an unfortunate name. A full star is deducted because service should be twice as good with 2 servers. Instead  it was only about half as good as it should have been.Overall  not bad."
Lauren H.,Henderson  NV,0,18,1,9/17/2013,5.0,This a local favorite for good food and drinks  a great atmosphere and the service is awesome. Norris and Emily are our favorite bartenders because they are always so welcoming and nice with huge smiles on their faces. It's always nice to stop in after a hard days work and enjoy good company over great drinks :)
Patricia P.,Henderson  NV,0,4,,10/26/2014,3.0,The food is good and there are plenty of choices. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu items. I will definitely return again and again.
Ken Y.,Las Vegas  NV,13,77,25,1/13/2013,3.0,New stuffed mushroom appetizer! The food is always fantastic  but their is always a wait and the servers are stretched to the max. If you want something like say a drink refill  you will have to wait for your server to come back around which always seems to take longer than it should. We will be back because the food is soo good  we have lowered our expectations for the service.
Rick B.,Las Vegas  NV,10,5,,2/18/2013,5.0,Having moved here from So. Cal about 3 years ago  I needed a new local hang and this is it. Good food. Good service. Fun regulars. Great bartenders! Special shout out to Ben  Tyler  and Kevin. These guys are fun to hang with and take care of business. Norris  Kayla and Aubrey are all great too  just not so sports minded which with that awesome TV is well....... Okay. Just not as entertaining. I give it five stars because its my new comfortable home away from home.
Megan A.,Las Vegas  NV,58,75,,8/1/2010,4.0,"I love their ""adult"" homemade rootbeer is very tasty and delicious! It is pretty strong since they put jameson in it too. The thai shrimp lettuce wraps are full of flavor and spicy! The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is so good! It is topped with buffalo chicken peices  celery  and ranch dressing. mmmM!! The grilled chicken stuffed potato was HUGE! It was topped with chicken and alfredo sauce. Don\'t get me started on their pizookies! The white chocolate macadamia topped with vanilla ice cream is my favorite!Service is usually hit or miss here. The last time I went  our server SUCKED. It took her forever to take our orders. My friend accidentally dropped a piece of food in his water and when he asked her for a new water  she just filled it up. It took us about 5 more mins to wave her down to tell her that he wanted a new water due to him dropping food in it. Then she just brings us our check without even asking if we wanted dessert. And of course we wanted dessert! The food is great  but the service is just okay."
Herb N.,Las Vegas  NV,3,35,,3/30/2012,3.0,Nothing here to get real excided about. The prices are ok. The food also is ok
Marvin T.,Henderson  NV,41,4,,4/8/2013,4.0,This place is awesome! I love it. They have their own brew house and the selections are great. I enjoy myself everytime at this place  the service is quality and the food is tasty. No matter what i order i always make sure I have those shrimp lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Also on Tuesdays their wines by the glass are half off. For improvements I would say to make sure that there are no water marks on the silverware and plates  minor details matter. But overall  I love this place. It is my favorite in the area.
Henry H.,Las Vegas  NV,11,16,,11/20/2010,2.0,Well  if you like mediocre food and lackluster service  then you'll love BJ's!The food is on par with what you would expect from a chain restaurant. Decent but nothing really exciting. Service was pretty slow. Our friend ordered a pia colada. After she tried it  my wife and I both tried a sip. It tasted of a little alcohol and blended ice. She returned it for a pepsi. Then my wife had ordered an appetizer salad. Our entrees were delivered  and no salad. The server realized she forgot the salad and told us she would bring it out and have the manager take it off our bill. Then the server offered a refill on our friend's pepsi  and brought a diet pepsi. Now I know why it's been almost a year since I've been to a BJ's  and why I'll most likely never go back.
William M.,Henderson  NV,37,24,1,1/9/2013,3.0,Food has gone down a bit the last few months. If it weren't for the bartender that we typically go see we probably wouldn't bother as often as we do but I know that a place this well known shouldn't run out of main items on the menu that often. Seems like every time I go they are out of something that I want.
R P.,Spokane  WA,82,81,56,10/28/2012,4.0,Awesome pizza! Samplers of beer are fun to try and their specialty/seasonal stuff is very good
Jean B.,Knoxville  TN,6,5,2,4/29/2013,4.0,Sit at the bar....bartenders are great! Mahi tacos perfect.
Jesse C.,Henderson  NV,49,162,5,11/13/2012,4.0,This was the 2nd time I have been here. This time I tried some new Garlic Chicken  Bacon Ranch pizza. The pizza was fabulous. You can get it deep dish or hand tossed. Everything about the pizza was good  no complaints on the food whatsoever. I did think the server was a bit slow. We had an older lady and she took a long time to come around to get our orders. Also  the prices can be a bit high for some but it's for good quality foods. This place also has some of the best desserts too  but again you have to pay a pretty penny for any of the desserts. I wish I could do 1/2 stars because I would probably go 3.5 on this one just because the prices and service weren't good enough  but the food is great and that's reason enough for me to stick with 4 stars here.
Sonny A.,Henderson  NV,130,22,1,9/7/2013,4.0,Good food and great atmosphere. Love all the tv's especially on weekends to watch sports. Recommend the deep dish pizza.....fantastic.
Anthony G.,Las Vegas  NV,7,13,2,6/7/2012,4.0,Get the potato skins  or the giant baked potatoes cause they are bomb. Also they really good pizza  and this thing called pazookie for desert. Staff is always friendly. I got the jambalaya and it was very tasty and spicy too.
Mike J.,San Francisco  CA,142,111,6,9/18/2010,1.0,Sometimes it's amazing how bad service can be at places. I'm not sure if it's management/staffing or if it's the bartenders / size of the bar at this place but the service is ridiculously bad/slow.For example  dropped in to catch the SF/LAD game on the nice TV's they have in the bar area. Took 10+ minutes to put an order in for a beer  asked if they could put the game on and by the time we'd finished our beer they still didn't make an effort to put the game on. Never mind  we'll watch somewhere else donks.The kicker is it was a Tuesday and the place was like half full. LOL.All in all it's a chain that operates like a chain. Go to PT's where the service is better...I will!!!
Erin M.,Henderson  NV,0,4,,6/10/2013,1.0,I wish Yelp had negative reviews. Last week  I was in a party of 8 including my husband and 2 year old. BJ's was running busy and we had to wait a good while for our table-about 30-40 min but it is what it is  I didn't mind that. We finally got to our table and waited about 20 minutes before a waiter showed up. We placed drink orders and about 20 minutes later  someone comes and delivers drinks to 7 of the 8 people. We finally track down someone to tell them we are missing a drink. OK fine whatever. So we place our food orders.We get the food for everyone but the pregnant lady (me) and the 2 year old. Just as with the drinks  NO ONE stops and even checks to see if we all have our food  it's literally dump and run with the waiters. So I'm thinking surely it will come soon  and wait  and wait  along with a toddler who is getting ticked because he has no food. Because I haven't seen our waiter in forever  I get up and go track him down where of course  he's clueless. I tell him to cancel my order and I take my son and leave because at this point  everyone else has pretty much finished their food. I understand busy  but at least check and make sure everyone at the table has their order! I told a manager on the way out what had happened and he told me that how we were treated was unacceptable. Well  duh. So I took my hungry  grumpy 2 year old and left. I have been here before and the service has always been so-so  but they just took a nosedive off a cliff for me here.
Devin E.,Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,2/19/2013,5.0,We came here after work for beer and pizza and the staff was very friendly. We ordered a bacon ranch chicken pizza with no onion... When our pizza came it did in fact have onion but it wasn't a big deal to pick it off. Our waitress offered to get us a new pizza without onion right away but we declined. Before our check came the manager came to us with a fresh pizza in a to go box without onion free of charge just to be sure we left completely satisfied. We were all very impressed with the excellent service!
Tiffini D.,Smyrna  TN,17,78,5,1/3/2012,5.0,Everyone is always so nice here and even better....THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PIZZA! It's so delicious  I may or may not have eaten it twice in one week. No judging. They have a great drink menu and Tuesdays wine is 1/2 off at the bar. I ordered food to go recently and the host on the phone was SO nice and had great manners. I think his name was Dylan. If I had a company  I would steal him away! Bartenders  hostesses and waiters are always friendly and helpful. Love this neighborhood spot!!!
Carmen M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,8,1,11/18/2010,2.0,"Been here a couple times and only a couple times for a reason.Last time I was here I had the parmesan crusted chicken. The crust was too hard and the chicken was dry and hard to cut through. The mashed potatoes had that cardboard box taste and they were cheap with the broccoli.The other times I\'ve been here the food wasn\'t impressive either. Baked mac and cheese was bland as was the salad. Getting the order right is also another challenge for this place. My brother had ordered salmon teriyaki  and they came out with shrimp teriyaki instead.Service was lacking. The waiter I had barely ever came to our table.When my mother came to meet up for dinner once i had finished taking a bite of my dry chicken  she asked me what specialties they had.. i believe i told her ""nothing.""So for someone like me who isn\'t really a picky eater  this says something about the place. I will take my money and enjoy it somewhere else."
Frank V.,Las Vegas  NV,6,21,,3/4/2012,1.0,When a local bar charges you $9.75 for a Framboise Lambic on tap (12oz)  I don't even want to give it 1 star. They have great food  but this is a travesty. This is not the Strip. I am a local! Beers on tap should never cost more than $5 in my opinion. Guess Ellis Island will see me more often now as they care more about their locals with $1.75 beers. The owners of BJ's sure don't care!
Rena L.,Henderson  NV,408,23,,10/14/2012,4.0,Love going there fir lunch. Fast service and good food! Love their appetizers .
Michele B.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,157,41,35,12/5/2012,1.0,Service slow  messed up the order twice. One of our party did not get their food til after the rest of us were done. No apology.... Just excuses.
Savannah Q.,Las Vegas  NV,20,27,,5/4/2010,3.0,"...I remember going to BJ\'s a few years back (Summerlin location) and that I ordered a baked potato  not sure which one  but I remember enjoying it...This time around I went because I was craving fish and chips  we saw BJs and decided to give them a try.Service:We were seated in a timely matter  but after reading over the menu a few times and finally deciding  we still hadn\'t seen a person to take our drink orders. Finally a young lady takes our drink and food orders and tell us she will find our server for us. What?? She wasn\'t our server?? Where the heck is our chick at? Anyways  after a little bit more time our server comes out and asks  shyly  if we would like malt vinegar with our fish and chips....I say yes  and she goes. With the way she spoke  I figured she was new and decided not to get worked up about it. She was a sweet girl and so was the other lady who helped us. I\'m taking a star off for her not being around much after  and watching other people at her tables have to get up and grab silverware off of other tables and what not...Food:I ordered a strawberry lemonade...and I think something went wrong...it didn\'t taste like anything...usually strawberry lemonades....have flavor. I think I may have made a mistake by asking if their lemonades are ""home made.""  (..i hate being picky about lemonade....)Fish and chips: Good. Not great. But I ate them. My fries were cold  but I still ate them... and even if I wanted to complain  my server wasn\'t around.My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he enjoyed it. I took a tiny bite and it tasted good.Not old enough to drink so I can\'t review on the beers. Sorry kiddos.I probably wouldn\'t go here again. It has a huge selection of good food  and could please a lot of people. Its not terrible  but not my cup of tea."
Bob L.,Henderson  NV,104,13,1,1/29/2012,5.0,Just signed up for the new BJs rewards card. Try their own beers and the Lunch specials are bar none amazing! Had an amazing server and everything about the place was very good!
Megan M.,Las Vegas  NV,62,165,24,10/5/2011,5.0,"I love BJ\'s! I had been to the Summerlin location a couple times but hadn\'t been to the newer Eastern location. An old co-worker suggested we meet for dinner here. I fell in love! I had the Tomato and Mozzarella salad with a Chicken and Pesto flat bread pizza. I raved about it so much that my mom and I went the next day and split the same salad and pizza. Then I continued to rave about it so my mom  husband and I went the day after that and tried the appetizer sampler....so good! Then my mom raved to my dad so my parents  husband and I went to dinner there! We all ordered separated dinner entrees. Everyone really enjoyed their meal! We\'ve all been back for lunch and happy hour. Their tomato bisque is to die for! I haven\'t had anything bad here. The beer is great and the servers are pleasant! I\'ve never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get a table. It\'s a great ""go-to"" place if you\'re looking for an easy place to eat with tons of options. I\'m excited to try their brunch!Without a doubt  I will be back!"
Dodie K.,Wahiawa  HI,1,2,,5/21/2014,1.0,"I\'m writing this as I wait....we arrived at 10:30pm  got seated by the manager who came from the bar area because hostess was busy talking story. After 20 minutes at our little booth for 6 people  we were about to leave but a server finally comes to take our drink order. When we mentioned to server that we were about to leave  she apologized and gave an excuse of a server got ""cut""  so she will be starting our drink order. Decided to stay. Another server came 10 minutes after our drinks arrived to take our food order. Finally at 11:30pm  we are eating...yay! Food is good. Our table had a couple burgers  rib eye steak  chicken alfredo  and a salmon salad. Looking around our table  there are no complaints about the food. Server had no name tag  so I had to ask for his name. His name is Eric. There is only around table and another table of people right now  so I don\'t understand why service is so BAD! So long story  short...food is good but service is HORRIBLE! PEOPLE BEWARE!!!!!"
German C.,Las Vegas  NV,1,1,,6/30/2014,1.0,I came to watch a world cup game at the bar ... I used to have lunch at Bjs like 4 times a week... I see before during football season audio is way louder... During world cup game i ask 3 times and i barely can hear ... Angela is a manager and she never take care of the situation and to be honest that makes me to not come back at Bjs anymore.... Service and food is great... Manager is poor
Bridgett M.,Henderson  NV,7,14,,6/27/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,So I went here again with my kids this time on father's day very busy which was fine ....the bad is my order got lost some how so one hour later I had to find the host the manager came over and offer the whole meal free
Marlyn M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,5/13/2014,2.0,WE went around 7 pm on a mMonday eve. All was going well when the food took 45 min. to get to table and it was only egg rolls and hamburger. The server was ok but never the less the food took forever. I can usually wait about 25 min but this was outrageous. Sorry BJ's we won't be back!
Stan M.,Denver  CO,18,301,,3/6/2010,4.0,BJ's is a really good place. I went there after a round of golf and had a great meal. The fish tacos are very good Good beer (had the Porter) and even better mixed drinks. The BJ's Rootbeer float drink (Rootbeer  Schnapps  Bailys  Jameson's) is absolutely delicious. I dare you to just have one  just be sure to have a designated driver!
Bryan C.,Las Vegas  NV,44,52,22,4/30/2012,4.0,One of my favorite places to eat. I have been here many times  ordered many things. But the thing you gotta try more than once is the pizza  so good! They have their own microbrews which they make in house  I really enjoy the Blonde ale the most but the seasonal ones are very good as well. Appetizers are good  so many to choose from but I tend to get these artichoke bites that you can just pop right into your mouth. Come for lunch  it ranges from $6-10.
Laine G.,Las Vegas  NV,124,87,59,3/19/2012,3.0,"On a bit of a ""healthy"" food kick these days... so I love that they have an ""Under 575 Calories"" menu. The Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi was surprisingly tasty. The stir-fry veggie-pineapple fried rice was yummy and filling. Sooo... I couldn\'t help but cheat just a little... but how can you go to BJ\'s and resist the Avocado Egg Rolls?! I suppose you could if you didn\'t like avocados.. but if you\'re a fan and you haven\'t tried them  definitely give them a go on your next visit! :)"
Alyssa V.,Sunrise  Las Vegas  NV,9,30,9,10/7/2014,1.0,Couldn't wait to try this location for the last several months since we moved over here. We won't be back. Walked into the restaurant around 9 PM (they don't close until midnight) to nobody on stand. After a few minutes  a host grabbed 2 menus & just sat us without saying anything. Our waitress seemed nice  took our order & the food came out about 20 min later. I didn't get the side of ranch I ordered  so I had to flag her down & didn't get it until my fries were cold. We also didn't get any silverware/napkins  so we had to flag her down again & then she brought ONE. She then came back about a minute later (after I took about 2 bites of my meal) & asked if we wanted dessert. I told her that we weren't sure since we just got our food. We didn't see her the rest of the time. Another waitress had to fill up my husbands water after he didn't have anything to drink for his whole meal. The different waitress then asked what we wanted for dessert & she seemed annoyed when I asked for a menu because we didn't know what there was. I'm shocked that the service was this horrible. The summerlin restaurant was PACKED (there was maybe 2-3 tables per waitress/waiter at this henderson one) & our service was way better at Summerlin. We were kind & didn't ask for much  so one star is all I can muster up for a $35 pasta & burger with all we dealt with. One star goes to the food that was actually really good. It's a shame that this is only a few minutes away  but we will go the distance so we don't leave angry again. It's not that hard to just be at least kind of nice & actually service basic needs when that's your job. Not sure what everyone's deal is here...they're all snoody or annoyed & it makes a horrible experience.
claire p.,Las Vegas  NV,19,46,3,8/22/2011,4.0,Food is decently priced. Good atmosphere. I like to come here for lunch on occasion  their soup combo is fabulous. Right amount of food for a good price  plus their drinks arnt too shabby!
Annie D.,Boulder City  NV,0,2,,3/30/2015,4.0,had a chance to go and try the pazooki that iver been hearing about and it was crazy good
Joey P.,Las Vegas  NV,2,48,,2/10/2012,3.0,"Excruciatingly sloooowwwww service. I\'ve never witnessed such inefficient serving. Bring drinks  don\'t take food order; bring order  but don\'t bring the meals for the kids because you can\'t carry everything. How about just get the kids first  then the rest? Drop off to go boxes after meal and not the check  too. Lost 10-15 minutes of time waiting for huge gaps in service.Food was fine  but I as a patron should not have to ask ""could you take my order"" or ""could I have my check"" when clearly I was ready for both at those times. Our server was either new or just not ready for work that day because she was operating in slow motion compared to her coworkers."
Sheri Y.,Las Vegas  NV,191,97,23,3/9/2011,3.0,pretty ah-ite place for american grub. bj's is never my first choice  but when friends want to go i'm down. i've had the pizzas  pastas  and pretty much everything pan asian and they are all do-able  but i never finished a meal and looked forward to my next visit. sorry bj lovers  i more of a cheese fac. fan!
Tricia M.,Santa Clara  CA,123,391,321,4/2/2010,3.0,"This is my first time eating at this location  but I\'ve been to many many other locations over the last 15 or so years in California and Washington. I always liked it  but for some reason over the last few years I don\'t think the quality of the food has been good.My husband and I went here a few weeks ago for a quick meal because it was so close to our home and we hadn\'t eaten all day  since I was testing for my PMP exam that day (I passed  yay). I probably should have dragged him someplace better to celebrate  but I was so exhausted from not sleeping and stressing over this exam to the point where I was sick  that I just wanted to go somewhere and get food and unwind with a few beers.I had the grilled shrimp tacos because I wasn\'t in the mood for pizza with a side salad  and my husband got a medium pepperoni pizza. The pizza is the same here as the other locations  has the big chunks of tomato with little sauce (unless you ask for extra like he does). The shrimp tacos were pretty mediocre  but being that it was a deep dish pizza joint and not a mexican restaurant  I didn\'t expect them to be wonderful. But I also didn\'t expect them to be so ""blah "" either and I wouldn\'t order them again.I wouldn\'t go out of my way to go here  and I think the beer at Ellis Island is much much better. However  being that it was down the street from where I live  I\'ll probably go here again."
Mary S.,Las Vegas  NV,142,23,14,12/2/2011,4.0,It was our first time here last night and I really liked the food and service. We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and my boys loved it. It wasn't over cooked so the texture was just perfect. We tried the Bj's deluxe burger and it was so big! My husband and I barely ate half of it. My kids also liked their kids meal and received it pretty quick considering it was a full house there. For dessert they tried the mini pizookie with chocolate chunk ice cream. It was so cute and perfect for their appetites. I would say the strawberry lemonade was my favorite :) I would definitely go back and try other stuff there...
Ashley S.,Spring Creek  NV,63,102,29,11/29/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Great food as usual. SLOW service. The one bar waitress to all the tables is ridiculous. They have other servers for the resuraunt portions just standing around watching as the one bar area server runs around like crazy. Management should step in and get that girl some help and not let her get overwhelmed and customers become irritated at the lack of service. Our waitress still did an ok job for all the tables she had to handle. Poor management though.
Sophia B.,Henderson  NV,2,26,,4/13/2009,4.0,Finally! A BJ's in Henderson! This location opened about a month ago  and from the business it was doing this past Friday night  it's going to be around for a long time.The food is as good as I remember from my few visits to the Summerlin location. The pizzas are fantastic (try the BJ's favorite or the Great White). The loaded baked potatoes are gigantic and filled to the brim with your choice of toppings (the garden veggie and chili cheese are delicious). And the salads  especially the field greens and the bbq chopped  are enormous and really tasty.I went with a group of 8 people and our food came out relatively quickly (especially considering how busy it was). The staff was friendly and accommodating. I'd recommend a visit!Just a word of advice: if you're planning on visiting this location on a friday night or over the weekend  I'd recommend calling ahead and getting yourself on the wait list (it gets really busy!). The restaurant only takes reservations for groups larger than 10  but if you call ahead about an hour before you want to eat  the greeter will put your name on the wait list and you'll get a table pretty quickly.
Mariana C.,Las Vegas  NV,128,38,9,9/28/2011,5.0,This is my and my friends' favorite place to eat! No matter how late  the people are always nice and recommending the best on the menu (as well as the little secrets not on the menu). This is definitely a place to go with two or more people.
Melinda S.,Las Vegas  NV,49,6,2,7/23/2012,4.0,We eat here at least least once a week....great place for kids or meeting the girls for a drink. Large selection on the menu and beer selection is AMAZING! Nice selection for kids as well  lots to chose from. Ask for Rachel if you go  she always give great service!
John D.,Henderson  NV,57,11,2,2/14/2012,5.0,Best of the Best. Never had a bad experience  recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone! I have a lot of items on there menu and must say i have never had a bad meal. Great Kids menu as well. Always a line out the door  but never have a problem getting a table
Sara W.,Minneapolis  MN,11,6,18,5/1/2011,4.0,I love BJS! The bartenders are awesome and the beer is the best! I highly recommend the Lightswitch. Their mini pizzas are just the perfect size for happy hour. If you're at the bar and have a game you'd like to watch  the bartenders are great about getting it on one of the TVs for you.
Courtney M.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,3/9/2014,5.0,The food here is wonderful and the service is even better! We had Maggie as a server  and she was so attentive  fun  and amazing!
Nancy S.,Westmont  IL,15,34,5,11/5/2011,3.0,Quick friendly seating. Enjoyed tropical tea. Waited about 20 min for sandwich and a salad. Huge tasty BBQ chicken salad and they split it for me to take half with me. Husband liked club sandwich. Fries were cold though. Salad was great.
Kelly G.,Las Vegas  NV,0,8,2,2/12/2014,5.0,Had an amazing seared ahi salad with a Jeremiah red. I will be asking for my server Justin P. again. I came in by myself and he made my time there awesome. Felt like royalty. Think I found my new favorite beer too.
Rafi M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,39,,10/29/2013,4.0,I like the gluten free pizza here the best. It's delicious and has a variety of toppings available. The service is friendly and the crowds are good. It's a good place to go for a casual dinner.
J - R e c c a.,Las Vegas  NV,0,10,,1/15/2010,4.0,Nice Place. Hope it sticks around.BJ's is a great place. Sorta like if The Cheesecake Factory had a child with a Gordon Biersch and that child ended up graduating from a reputable collage. Its both and yet better than either one.Beer: Drink some. the Hefe  the Stout  Pumpkin. Drink them all!Apps: SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP. No Joke  may be the best i ever had.Food: Parmesan Crusted Chicken  ask for extra cheesy goodness!P.S. Get a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut POOZOKIE
Zachary S.,Henderson  NV,6,46,,5/17/2009,4.0,I've been here twice and I'm sure I will be going back several more times over the coming months. I've only had a couple of appetizers and a small pizza  and I was fairly pleased. The avocado egg rolls weren't my cup of tea  but the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza was terrific. Not what I usually want when I am in the mood for pizza  but I was impressed by the meaty chunks of ground beef and the sauce that is drizzled over the deep dish pie.But enough about the food. I came here for the beer. My first time I tried their 7-beer flight. The Porter and the Tatonka Stout were a little heavy for me  but the red and brown ales were right up my alley. Some of their brews are STRONG in the alcohol department. I'll just leave it at that. What I was most surprised by was the selection of other beers on tap. Most brewpub-type places only serve their own concoctions  but this place offers options from a wide variety of American microbreweries and foreign brewers. The selection of tap beers that aren't made on the premises is impressive enough that I would likely want to return to BJ's even if they didn't make their own delicious booze.
Mark A.,Henderson  NV,7,43,,3/28/2011,3.0,I want to like this place more...I really do. Unfortunately  the execution just isn't there.BJ's has an excellent variety of food and beverages. The food ranges from average to good  with everything leaning on the expensive side. If I were to review based solely on food and beverage  they would probably get a 3.5- to 4-star rating. The problem starts and stops with the service. I understand the place is popular  busy during non-peak times and a downright unbearable wait during prime time  but the fact that they have such a constant stream of patrons makes the lack of execution in the kitchen even more unfathomable. I am yet to have a meal here with over two entrees ordered where all the entrees came out at the same time. I have waited as long as fifteen minutes between the first entree and last entree being served. To me  that's unacceptable. In addition  the wait staff seems to be rather hit or miss as to their general level of competency. Nonetheless  I'm sure that I'll continue to wind up here every month or two. Sigh.
Tiffany S.,Las Vegas  NV,67,127,,6/9/2010,3.0,I went to BJ's on Friday with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. We wanted a casual dinner and this place was ok for that. It was loud and really busy  but we were seated within 15 minutes.Our serve was nice  but you could tell she was a bit overwhelmed as there was a large party next to us. To get drink refills  I had to push my empty glass towards the end of the table  etcI got a tropical tea to drink  which was nice as it wasn't sugar sweetened  the only downside is they brewed it very weak. My husband had a steak and a HUGE baked potato. He said it was pretty good. I had the French dip with fries. It was ok  but I requested the thin fries as you have a choice of thin or seasoned. I think that was a mistake  they were on the plate  under the sandwich and were pretty limp and greasy. I asked for Ranch to eat them with but the ranch was just eh as well. The sandwich itself was pretty good.For dessert I really wanted a pzookie  but didn't want a large one  so my serve requested a mini one  for 3.00 it was quite large actually and pretty good!The woman next to us got nachos and they looked huge and good! So that might be an item to try in the future.All in all  it was alright. The bill was a little over 50 dollars w/ tip and I thought that was a bit high as there was no alcohol in the tab  but hubby ordered a steak  so not totally out of line.
jillian p.,Las Vegas  NV,123,86,142,4/1/2010,2.0,"This morning we had intended to go to Vintner Grill for brunch  however  their website hadn\'t been updated showing their reduced hours so we ended up going to BJ\'s Brew House nearby. Although we prefer to patronize independent restaurants since chains aren\'t usually too exciting  we find you can get decent food at reasonable prices and the food is always consistent. Obviously everyone else must feel the same because you don\'t see too many of them closing once they\'ve opened  and well  just look at every street corner in urban areas.I ordered the ""French Toast Combo"" ($7.95) but subbed the adult french toast for the children\'s Cap\'n Crunch coated and fried french toast. I don\'t know why you\'d order sugar-coated and deep fried food for your child but it sounded pretty good so I though I\'d give it a whirl. The eggs came out nice and hot and the apple-smoked bacon was of decent quality  but not crispy enough for my taste. The french toast was especially crispy but did not fall into the category of ""lightly fried"" as the description on the menu suggested. At first I thought it was alright but then I pressed down with my fork and saw oil starting to pool. Yuck. I reluctantly cut into the other piece which was astonishingly better. The Cap\'n Crunch taste was nowhere to be found but it was much lighter and a fun version of french toast. Ian had the grilled chicken and cheese stuffed baked potato ($8.95). The Alfredo sauce that accompanied it tasted like it was straight out of a bag of Bertolli\'s frozen pasta (really bad) and the potato was unexciting. It was definitely a GMO potato if I\'d ever seen one. What is America coming to..."
Mark E.,Las Vegas  NV,74,28,3,6/1/2011,4.0,Great All American Food. I am a fan of the pizza  the pizookie dessert  and the chicken dishes. Very tasty
Michelle S.,Las Vegas  NV,2,12,39,5/19/2010,3.0,This restaurant was suggested by several people so I thought we would finally give it a try. We went to the one located on Eastern and I-215. We were seated within 5 minutes after arriving. We ordered Avocado Eggs Rolls and Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. I really liked the Avocado Eggs Rolls and the others loved the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. The Entre's that were ordered were Parmesan Crusted Chicken  Fish Tacos and an Angus Burger. The Fish Taco plate came with (2) Fish Taco's. I only ate (1) taco and I couldn't taste the fish. My husband ate the other Taco and loved it. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was good but could have been better if there was more of the special sauce over the whole meal instead of on just a portion of it. The Angus Burger was a little dry and the menu said it came with Thousand Island Sauce  but that sauce was missing from the Burger. The Pomegranate Margarita's were delicious. I will try this restaurant one more time to check out the Pizza. Our toal bill was $71.00.
Jeff K.,Henderson  NV,114,208,64,9/9/2010,2.0,"Well  the place has been open for nearly 2 years now and we\'ve never tried it so we thought we would give it a go. The parking lot is usually full so it had me thinking they are doing something right.Anyways we get seated and take a look at the menu  we selected our choices and drinks. We were asked  ""WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS & SALSA?"" well like at most Mexican restaurants that is the way dinner usually starts (yes  I realize this isn\'t a Mexican restaurant)  so we said sure. Jumping ahead to get the message across to you  I get home and take a look at the receipt  well what do you know?! $5.50 charge on the check for Chips & Salsa. What really got me was that wasn\'t suggested as an appetizer  it was suggested as if was ""Would you like a glass of water?"" They didn\'t say  ""Would you like to start off with some potato skins or blah blah blah.."" Get my point? Well I called the manager on the phone about this and during one point of my complaint  she actually giggled at me!! She tried to make good and asked who my server was  but I said that I didn\'t blame the server I blame management for trying to ""up sell"" in a round about way. The ""manager"" then tried to make good and take if off my bill  I just said  ""I don\'t care about the $5.50  I am concerned about the way it got on to my bill in the first place"". What a unprofessional way to respond to a customer concern!Pros:Food wasn\'t horrible  but nothing outstanding about it.Cons:My 1/2 pound burger was kind of skimpy and makes me wonder what weighs 1/2 pounds? The entire burger weight? Also my burger patty was crumbly and was in 3 sections  all holding together for the most part but in sections. The french fries? I really dislike this micro threads of shoestring potatos. Wife had Fettucini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken breast was sliced thin and was very very tiny  looked like 1/3 of a breast cut up as a garnish. The pasta was good  but the noodles had what seemed to be heat lamp dryness to it. It was probably sitting and waiting to be presented together with my cooking hamburger. The Alfredo sauce was so thin it looked like it was non existent  but if you mix it up the sauce comes back up to the top and is present again.Overall we won\'t be coming back and really do not know what all the commotion is all about. My local neighborhood bars like Timbers or PTs can do better."
Andy G.,Las Vegas  NV,0,13,3,5/10/2009,5.0,I really enjoyed this place. They offer a wide variety on their menu  but are mainly known for the pizza and brew. I went with a friend  we ordered onion strings to start off with and they were ridiculously tasty. For the main course my friend had the small barbecue pizza  and I ordered the California sandwich (think thats what it was called). Anyways the pizza was kinda deep dish style and cooked perfectly. The sandwich consist of grilled chicken  avocado  chipotle sauce  mayo  and peppers on garlic bread  and it was fantastic. We were stuffed  big portions  and top notch customer service  I couldn't walk by one employee without them greeting me. I will come back here again and again.Oh and are bill with generous tip came to $40
Louis L.,Tuckerton  NJ,4,142,,3/12/2013,4.0,We were visiting Las vegas from out of town and try to venture off strip. This was so enjoyable to us  we went twice in 6 days. We found the service very good on 1st trip  and adequate on 2nd trip but the 2nd trip was very busy for them so I assume service level is dictated by how much the staff has to handle. Wife loved the free refills of house made sodas and I ejoyed the house porter & stout. Food quality above avg for a chain and we truly enjoyed the calif chicken sandwhiches and side salad upgrade was a nice feature. Surprisingly alot around us ordered Pizza- in a town full of pizza. I should think stick to bar style foods here. I would return if I`m in the area or find a BJs elsewhere would gladly stop
Martin T.,Las Vegas  NV,161,137,2,11/29/2010,3.0,Good Bar food good crowd  the home brews are good  service is good.
Daniel A.,Dyer  NV,38,16,,5/15/2011,4.0,Always tasty food at BJ's. Can be at bit slow but overall a great place for a meal.
Emily B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,7/11/2011,2.0,"Ok...so I waited for 4 visits to this place before finally giving it this bad review...what can I say  I WANTED so badly to give this place a chance  but they\'ve failed with each and every visit. Why did I keep going back? Reading their menu  I get enticed (although I usually end up let down) AND it is literally located about a block away from my home...so convenience. ANYWAY...its the service mainly that gave is making me give this place 2 stars...horriblly horribly SLOW  and just plain terrible. EVERY time I\'ve been here...so I give up on this place. Also  with tthis most recent visit...the first time I can say the food was just plain BAD. I ordered a ""honey cripy chicken salad"" or something...okay  there was NOTHING honey about the chicken (breading or what not)...it was just some plain old chicken tenders...and the salad was really watery  so when they mixed in the dressing for the chopped salad...it had no flavor whatsoever....of course when I asked for a side of dressing after experiencing that I had to WAIT (see above)....ugh  I just plain give up on this place!!!"
Neetu C.,The Strip  Las Vegas  NV,3,10,,2/9/2013,4.0,busy friday night  was seated in 15 minutes at a nice table. great service. food was delicious. ate family style with shrimp scampi (excellent) and bj favorite deep dish pizza. prices are reasonable  food is great  we love this place!
Kathi J.,Las Vegas  NV,2,59,2,1/29/2013,2.0,We have eaten here before and enjoyed everything  but we never had such horrible service as we experienced tonight for dinner. I had mentioned to the hostess and the manager that we were celebrating my Dad's 83rd birthday and that we would be ordering desert for him  (hoping they would at least put a candle on it). My father ordered coffee with cream and sugar  the waitress (Patricia) bought the coffee and cream but said she would be back with the sugar?? She bought him extra coffee in a little stainless steel teapot which did not keep the coffee hot. When he was ready for more coffee she bought him a cup but forgot the cream and said she would be back with the cream?? He sat for at least 5 minutes waiting for cream before someone else finally bought it. We wanted to order desert before we were done eating but she never came back. So when she finally took our dinner plates away we ordered desert and waited. She gave us our check before the desert even arrived and when another server brought the desert out--no candle--no have a happy birthday--nothing.The food was very good  especially the Barbecue chicken salad  but the service was not acceptable.And bring a flashlight to see the menu  some of the tables are so dark you can't read the menu. We watched other tables struggle to find some light to read the menu also.
Aaron T.,Las Vegas  NV,15,21,,3/30/2011,4.0,Been here a couple times  food has always been good  service has always been decent or better and they have some good beers. I'd definitely never complain about going back.
T L.,Las Vegas  NV,4,102,11,5/16/2010,1.0,If you want horrible service and want to be treated like you are an inconvenience to the wait staff  then bj's is for you. This place just flat out sucks!!! I won't be back. I'll use my federal reserve notes somewhere else.
Aaron M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,15,,3/19/2010,5.0,Happy Hour:M-F 3pm -7pmSun-Thurs 10pm - Close$1 off all Draft Beer and Cocktails1/2 off Mini Pizzas$2 off all appetizersIt's BJ's.. it's a chain.. anyone from California knows what they're about. The Happy Hour prices make me happy. I like the Buffalo Chicken Pizza as well.
Taylor S.,Henderson  NV,115,21,2,3/7/2012,3.0,"Me and my family (party of 6) went there for dinner a few nights ago. There was a 45 minute wait. No big deal. 55 mins pass and our buzzer finally buzzes. The hostesses then tell us to stand by the stairs and wait. Another 15 minutes of waiting we had to do..and people kept walking by us so we felt VERY in the way. I asked a hostess why we had to stand and wait here and she said ""so youre ready"". uhm okay? I was perfectly ready in my spot on the seat thankyouverymuch. Anyway  we ended up being crammed into a booth. Oh well  at least we all love each other in my family. Then the server was very blah..Not bad but not good. It was busy so im sure he was in the weeds a bit. I had the santa fe salad and about died..YUM! The rest was good but those hostesses need to get it together. I AM a hostess and have been for years so I know how things go and I would NEVER make a party stand in the middle of a walk way for 15 minutes to ""be prepared""."
Mike S.,Chino Hills  CA,4,51,2,7/26/2012,3.0,As a whole I like BJ's Brewhouse. I just didn't much care for my experience at this one. My daughter and I (She's the LV resident) went in for lunch and took a booth in the bar. Since I am somewhat a regular at my local BJs I already knew what I wanted. The California Burger and a Blue Moon. Our server tries to talk me out of my beer choice because he thought down selling was going to be a wise choice. When I told him he could not get me to change my mind  he kept trying to do it. This marks the first time he irritated me. We place orders and it took almost 15 minutes for the appetizer to come out and this only after my daughter looked at her watch then looked at him (no  they were not busy.) This was our second irritation. The whole time we are waiting for our food  our tool of a server was standing at the end of the bar talking with the bartender. This guy did not care about appearances and to me it was disrespectful to just be seen hanging out. Now I am getting pissed. Fast forward now...food comes out  granted they are still not busy  us and maybe one other table in the bar. My sandwich and fries come out  the fries are barely warm and bottom of my sandwich is soggy. Probably because our server left it sitting too long while he was yapping with the bartender. I am giving the restaurant 3 stars because I do still like the place. Our server  in my opinion deserves negative stars. I will not name our server  but the management should start watching what goes on in the restaurant.
Elizabeth D.,Corona  CA,38,107,,5/25/2010,5.0,My husband and I are big fans of our local BJ's in Corona  so while in Vegas we decided to meet up with his uncle here while his uncle was in vegas on business. We like BJ's because of their gluten free options. Although this location didn't have the gluten free crust  they still had the menu and the manager even came out and personally addressed my allergy and indicated he would oversee the preparation to make sure everything went well. I thought that was above and beyond and the first time a manager had done that for me. Service was great and food was great as usual!
John L.,Dover  DE,0,19,,3/17/2013,1.0,We ordered a pomegranate margarita and porter beer. The margarita came in a water glass  was extremely sour and tasted like pink grapefruit juice. We requested a well done burger that was at most medium and the blackened salmon looked as if it had hit a frying pan with some butter and finished in the salamander. Definitely not blackened. The sauce on the plate tasted like water downed ranch dressing. The clam chowder was over salted which took away from any taste it might have had. They did comp us for the food and we paid for the drinks but in hindsight  should have also sent back the $10 margarita also. We did tip the waitress appropriately since it was not her fault the food was lacking but we had to ask for silverware and napkins after the main course arrived.
Kim K.,New Brunswick  NJ,13,18,,10/15/2012,4.0,I attended a friend's birthday party two weeks ago and I ordered a calzone...it had onions and cheese. It is so good. A waiter and host knows little bit sign language. It is cool. BJ offers tons of menu. It is my first and last..I have not tried other food unfortunately. A really fast service  seriously.
Mj A.,Las Vegas  NV,58,11,,3/6/2011,3.0,Bjs rule...get ur mind out of the gutter beavis. But they do:) muhaaahhah
Kat G.,Beverly Hills  CA,4,118,43,3/4/2012,3.0,Tried the gluten-free pizza. Crust was way better than Sammie's Woodfired  but needed to ask for a side of sauce. They don't carry vegan cheese so without the cheese the gf pizza is just a crust with 1 tablespoon? of sauce spread on it. First time the sauce the server brought was fresh out of the fridge- really? To put on a hot pizza? Then she came back with some warm sauce per our request- in the bowls they probably serve ketchup in but I only had 1 piece of pizza left after waiting for the sauce. Luckily we had ordered 3 toppings ($1 each) or it would have been extremely sad. They really should have all their signature pizzas available to order & just charge extra for the gluten-free crust. It was still good but I can make this at home buying the gf crust from Whole Foods deli (tastes & looks the same). Not sure we'll be back again. This is not a real gf pizza like Picazzo's in Arizona or Fresh Brothers in LA. So still looking for a good vegan gluten-free pizza in Vegas.
Jae G.,Las Vegas  NV,430,117,247,12/13/2009,4.0,Pizza is yum! So far  the service has been great and accommodating for large parties. . Checked out other BJ's in S.F. And So. Cal and it's always crackin!
Pam T.,Henderson  NV,0,31,2,3/26/2014,1.0,"So sick of going back to the Henderson  NV location.. Everytime we go service is AWFUL.. Tonight we went at 3:30 thinking service wouldn\'t be as bad and they seated us in the bar area (hehem with our 18 yr old daughter) and I ordered salmon  my husband ordered  pizza  and my daughter got an appetizer.. I actually walked out because my salmon took until 5:00 for some reason and the waiter was so dumb he said our order was taking longer because of the salmon.. How stupid is he to offend a customer  really? I wouldn\'t have cared so much had not ALL of the booths around us filled up and they were all leaving or having dessert when our food finally came and the table in front of us had all steaks! When he used the salmon excuse I told him it was easier than steak and he ran off like a baby and I wasn\'t even loud.. So weird.. Not going back to this B.J.\'s and always ask myself if these people interviewed for a job being as negligent as they are as waiters.. Oh  to defend this place I could tell his co-workers were thinking  ""Oh God  he sucks.. """
Mur T.,Henderson  NV,33,202,51,8/16/2009,3.0,Like every other brew house chain. Been to Gorden Bierch  Hops or the Yard House? Then you've been here. Constant food quality  $1 off happy hour drinks 3-7pm Monday to Friday and late night happy hour 10:30 pm to close. Nicely executed chain food.
Ross H.,Las Vegas  NV,5,12,,3/25/2010,4.0,What a great place! Love their burgers and the pazookie is to die for. Wish the wait was shorter  but I am definitely come back again  again.
Emily C.,Las Vegas  NV,57,39,8,8/17/2011,5.0,Love this place!! I usually order the flat bread pizza with half a salad  and my husband likes the calzone. They have a drink called the lime in the coconut. . its tasty!
Joie A.,Anthem  Las Vegas  NV,18,1,,2/18/2012,4.0,My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice lunch date together instead of the usual fast food run so we went to BJ's. BJ's isn't a fancy restaurant but it is a little more on the pricier side  but definitely worth it. We usually don't eat so heavily for lunch but we couldn't help ourselves once we saw the menu. We decided on the stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer because we heard a lot of good things about them and they were 100% right. The stuffed mushrooms were so delicious  perfect for an appetizer because the small portions definitely boosted up my appetite because I know for sure that I wanted more. Soon after our appetizer we received our soup of choice  I got the clam chowder and my boyfriend got their chili. The clam chowder was pretty good  nothing too special about it but there was nothing wrong with it either. The chili on the other hand needed an acquired taste I guess because I wasn't very fond of it because of the beer flavor. Since BJ's is a brewery I'm not surprised but it just didn't taste right to me. My boyfriend ate it because he ordered it but he wasn't the biggest fan of their chili either. (on a side note: a different time I went  I had their tomato soup and it was incredibly delicious...since we're on the soup subject.) after we finished our soup we noticed we weren't getting very good service because our server hadn't taken away our appetizer platter and we were done with our soups already  and our glasses were empty. Usually Im not picky and I don't mind but it wasn't busy at the time we went and our table was extremely tiny because it was just the two of us. I felt cluttered and a bit forgotten by our server. We ended up having to ask another server if they could take our plates and refill our drinks because our server was no where to be found. Anyways  when we finally got our main dishes  all was forgotten because the food was literally to die for. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken in lemon cream sauce. The portion was huge but I can't complain because I ordered from the dinner section  but I'm not complaining because leftovers was fine with me. I order an extra side of the lemon cream sauce because it was too delicious not to  and the chicken to sauce ratio was not sitting right with me with the extra sauce. Every bite was dreamy and delicious. The dish came with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. The two sides went magnificently with the lemon cream sauce. If I could have  I most definitely would have finished but my stomach wouldn't allow it. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya they serve there. I'm not a big fan of jambalaya in the first place so I don't want to comment on it since its already not my cup of tea. We knew about they're famous pizookies but we were way too full from our meal so we got our check  left a little less than decent tip for our ghost server and left. All in all the lunch was incredible. I definitely love this place.
robert m.,Las Vegas  NV,0,24,,1/21/2010,3.0,been to this location about 5 times now. and it is consistently DECENT. service is always very robotic and lacks personality  and beer refills take forever unless your at the bar/lounge.they have a good selection of beers  but i stick my boddingtons pub ale!! last nite had a small pizza and wedge salad  the others had grilled shrimp tacos and a classic turkey club. all were good  but not stellar. was there at 6:30  and the place was half full and staff standing around everywhere.i give 3 stars because its so consistent  and what else ya gonna get in henderson if your not in the mood for one particualr thing  they have a big menu so everyone can find something.3 of us for dinner with a few beers was 60 bucks
A O.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,5/31/2012,4.0,I've been to this location several times and each time I've received excellent service from the moment I walk in to the time I exit. Whether its dine in or carry-out  their staff is friendly  knowledgeable  and fast. The food is always delicious  served hot fresh from the oven and they toast the chips when you order chips & salsa!!! My favorite items are the spinach and artichoke pizza followed by a white choc/macadamia or oreo pizookie. If you go to the Eastern Ave location  you are better off parking behind the restaurant  it is not only easier to find parking but also easier to exit.
Darlene L.,Chicago  IL,0,195,,8/13/2009,4.0,Very good casual restaurant with a huge menu. Salads were large with fresh ingredients and good dark rolls. The stuffed potatoes are a fine and filling meal as a non meat option. Sandwichesvare generously dressed with meat  and our grilled fish was decent. Pleasant service and inviting drink menu. French fries were cold but quickly replaced.
Chastine V.,Brooklyn  NY,147,129,87,11/29/2010,4.0,went here the saturday evening with a group of 11. (2 kids and 1 baby.) had to wait half an hour for a table but that was expected. we had a really nice server but i forgot his name. he was from hawaii and made conversation with us. was funny and joked around. the place was busy but he kept checking on us. got all of our food and drink orders right. i had a bite of the calamari and it was pretty good. shared the medium deep dish sausage and pepperoni pizza. had a few pieces to take home with the boyfriend. had a slice of BJ's favorite pizza and i loved that. (sadly my boyfriend doesn't dig veggies like i do so i had to sample from his grandparents plate.) so much green peppers and olives. all the colors on it made me love it even more. i say if you don't want to wait for a table go on a week night when i would assume them to be less busy  but their deep dish pizza is really worth trying out with a glass of red wine.
