Rummy V.,"Columbia, MD",316,233,990,3.0,2/7/2017,"Norristown is my hometown, I was born in this area but still am discovering things around there. Me and my family went for a late night munchies to Applebees during half off appetizers. We had a great time, the food was delicious and service was nice. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because of military discount complications, the discount is 10%...We all shared our appetizers and had a blast but when the bill came it only took off military discount off one of the appetizers (the cheapest one) and only takes off 10% which is .40 cents off of a $63 bill. I don't consider that being military friendly, especially when they pick the cheapest meal of what to take 10% off. Besides that everything was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4

Dan W.,"Philadelphia, PA",283,120,923,3.0,5/14/2015,"like most other applebee's - average food quality with average service.  applebee's menu gets confusing these days with the numerous offers/combos you can get whether its 2 for $20, appetizer mix and match, lunch special mix and match, daily specials, and special events...woof gets dizzying to decide what to order at times.   I recommend staying on the conservative side and ordering items that you know an average sit down chain restaurant cannot really mess up - bone/boneless chicken wings, chicken tenders and fries, ect.   only recommend restaurants like applebees when you are very limited in your options and looking for a sitdown place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4
Heather S.,"Norristown, PA",172,115,4,3.0,2/17/2016,"I've never been a huge fan of Applebee's. I've always thought there were better chain restaurants out there as far as the food quality and service. This past Saturday I went with a friend for their 1/2 price wine. We had already eaten, so this was strictly a drinking trip to Applebee's. We sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by a very friendly male bartender. He was on top of his game. We stayed for about 3 hours and received excellent service throughout. As far as a HH/drinking spot, I highly recommend the bar.

Kimberly O.,"Collegeville, PA",0,4,,2.0,10/22/2016,"Last night we had dinner here and while the waitress was very friendly and attentive, the food was just okay. My husband had a burger and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had (and he's not a big burger eater so this surprised me). But I had a chicken dinner with mushrooms and onions, and the chicken was pretty gross. It had a bite to it instead of the normal shredding when you chew it, the gravy was lots of onions with just a few glimpses of mushrooms. And the kids meals were overpriced for a small bowl of mac and cheese and pizza made on a roll. Overall, would we go back? Possibly for burgers, but not for any type of chicken. But again, our waitress was amazing and made the meal enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4

Mario G.,"Fishers, IN",0,3,,2.0,8/14/2016,"Our visit was sub-par due to service. From the moment we walked in, there was a group of three who were skipped for seating three times. The hostess suggested a high-top table by asking, ""Want to sit at a high-top?"" Then went directly to the table without giving us an option. We wanted a booth. We were eventually seated at a booth. Our entrees came out, before we were a quarter of the way through the appetizer, and both came out before we had utensils. Our waitress was pleasant enough, but she only refill our drinks once, well just one of our drinks not both. It could have been worse, we could have been served by the waitress who didn't want to be there; it was written all over her face. Poor service due to management's poor ability to motivate the team positively in my opinion. At least the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4
Virginia S.,"Chalfont, PA",0,10,,1.0,5/31/2016,"Stopped on our way home to eat here last night. Seated right away, but server took a good 10 min to even come over or welcome us. We ordered immediately figuring that would be a bad sign. Food came out right away and was excellent, however our server was no where to be found again and we had no utensils and no napkins with two small children. We ended up eating half the meal by picking at it. The table across from us actually got up and left because he just never came back. We tried to pay on the monitor, but of course our server never entered it so we actually had to wave him down to get the check.

Steven B.,"Orlando, FL",4392,1179,825,3.0,3/9/2014,"Not all Applebee's are created equal.  Physically, like most big chains, they undergo a remodel every few years.  If you took a tour of a bunch of Applebee's you'd notice that there are three common models out there.  This one is the latest and greatest as they received their remodel within the last couple of years.  As a customer, that means that everything looks fresh and new. You need to manage your expectations when it comes to the food.  If you are expecting gourmet cuisine then your IQ is probably very close to your shoe size.  The last time I visited here I had the CHICKEN FAJITA ROLLUP for $9.49. It tasted fresh and the fries were hot and crispy.  It got the job done. If you're going to have an adult libation or two or three this may not be the best place.  They are very conservative on the amount of alcohol they use in mixed drinks.  I was going to say stingy but I was nice instead.  So if you're drinking you might want to stick to beer or wine. I've found the service here to be fine and a couple of the bartenders to be excellent.   For me this is a typical three star chain experience and the Yelp term A-OK fits them perfectly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4

Justina P.,"Norristown, PA",24,2,,3.0,12/26/2015,"I'm going to preface this review by saying I have 22yrs of server/bartender experience (many of those years in corporate restaurants, including Applebees) , so I know the difference between a crazy busy shift and a lack of service standards.   Host was nice upon entering the restaurant, and immediately took us to our table.  Waited approx 5-7 minutes to be greeted before getting up and asking where our server was.  Again, if I noticed that it was busy I would have understood and waited, but while I waited to be greeted a group of employees and due to his business casual attire what I assume to be a manager were eating and chatting at a bar table and paying no attention to the new customers that had yet to be greeted. Another manager came to our table and apologized and took our drink order and my toddler's dinner order.  Finally our server came to the table and apologized for the wait as she was in the restroom (probably shouldn't have gone with the explanation). In my experience if you are going to be indisposed for a bit you should have someone watching your section.  I was able to immediately order and she went to put my order in.  The manager brought my daughters dinner out quickly which I was very thankful for.  My food came out a few minutes later. Wrong. I ordered brisket tacos, I was given brisket nachos.  When I said I ordered the tacos the manager said ""we don't have tacos, we have enchiladas"".  Granted I used the wrong wording, but if you don't have tacos then one would think the server would have known the menu well enough to specify what I wanted rather than just pick something. My server offered to get me the enchiladas I wanted and I said yes I'll take them home. My take out order was brought quickly by the manager and shortly after my server came by to make sure I got them and then just dropped the check.  REALLY??? we were still eating!!! She then disappeared and didn't return until I asked someone to find her so I could pay my check.  Again, do to his attire I assume this was another manager/supervisor and he said I could pay on the tablet that was on the table (apparently it only works sometimes though) but  that he would go get my server.  The manager did take the nachos and my daughter's meal off the check and I appreciate that.  Although, I would have prefered to pay for my meal in its entirety and had a better experience. I'm giving three stars because I don't want to cause their average to drop any lower and the above are things that can be worked on and easily fixed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4

Rissa H.,"Norristown, PA",107,81,21,2.0,3/3/2016,"Ok, so broke college kids love half price appetizers which is why we're typically at Applebee's after 9pm at least once a week. I usually go to the other one is norristown which I never had any issues with but this time was a nightmare. Literally 5 minutes into us being seated someone like three tables down is livid because their food was cold and the order was wrong. Our waitress was kind of scatter brained.... Serving isn't easy and definitely isn't for everyone, hence she should find new employment. Anyways, I could tell right off the bat she would be a bit of an issue because we ordered two waters and she had to come back and ask what our drinks were again two seconds later??? Huh? So I opted to order on the tablet on the table instead! Put everything through for her, she didn't have to do a thing except bring it out.... Well when she did the kitchen messed up our order. We asked for some of the spicy stuff on the side and they never brought out, so by the time they did.... The nachos were cold. Ugh! I had to keep pushing the call server button Because she never got it and had to push it for her to refill my water which was sitting at the edge of the table for almost 30mins no lie. They were ""out"" of one of the menu items we ordered... I don't like this location.

Chuck W.,"Norristown, PA",0,6,1,1.0,3/17/2015,"Went to Applebee's on Trooper Road a week or so ago for an early dinner with a friend.  We were quickly seated and waited on.  The temperature inside must have been 80 degrees or more.  The waiter had the personality of cardboard, the food came out relatively quickly, but it was very disappointing.  The portion of the savory cedar salmon was small and the creamy spread looked like it had just been unfrozen with microwaves.  The clump of spring vegetables looked pitiful.  The Triple Chocolate Meltdown was good, but for $6.59, it should have been.  Even though the waiter never asked if I wanted more coffee, I left a decent tip for a total of $30.00. We could have gone to Wegman's (not the Pub) and spent half as much or less, with just as nice atmosphere and friendly employees plus delicious, carefully prepared food, plus would have had leftovers to take home.  Or we could have driven out route 23 to Shady Maple Smorgasbord and eaten all we wanted of a wide variety of higher quality food for about half as much.  This will be my last trip to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4

Like every other Applebee's, it has plenty of parking, is reasonably clean, and totally devoid of personality. I ordered a randomly-named burger (~$9), maybe the Super Loud Burger, the Melting Western Burger, the Atrocious Tragedy Burger with Uncle Henry's BBQ Sauce, or maybe the Brewtus Steak Burger? (Whatever it was, it wasn't anything special.) While our super-friendly server (whose name I forget) took our orders, I noticed she was wearing a button that read something like: ""WE CARD BECAUSE WE CARE"". I asked her where I could get one and she said she'd look into it. During the meal, she stopped by to give me my very own button, for free! That's special treatment, and it earned her a nice tip.

Larry R.,"Norristown, PA",3,5,,2.0,12/4/2012,"I frequent this establishment. Recently I had to opportunity to try on of their new signature offerings, the SIZZLING DOUBLE BARREL WHISKY SIRLOIN. The picture and the description looked and sounded wonderful.   When it arrived, sizzling on the hot serving plate, I was already disappointed. The steak was there, with a little bit of onions and mushrooms, and two small scoops of mashed potatoes, that were not garlicky at all. And all that open space on the plate made them look lonely. The steak was good... just good. And the few onions and mushrooms that were there, hiding under the steak, were tasty. Too bad there were not more, like in the picture.  The potatoes were pretty plain and such small portion. It would have better with a little more to help make the plate more appetizing.

I wish I was exaggerating, but how they did not see that the dip could have been sipped and not eaten is beyond me. the bartender agreed something was terribly wrong and sent it back for a replacement.  this time it came out quickly, but now it was piping hot and had a weird brownish discoloration to it. so I surmised that they added what ever cheese stuff they had to it, and then nuked it to beyond recognition.  and it was STILL runny!  needless to say I did not touch it and already wanted to leave, but by now I was sooo hungry that the thought of tasty ribs tamed my discontent over the dip. I finally realized that I had been there almost 1 hour when the ribs appeared. I only had to poke them with my fork to know they were not done. I cut one rib off and unsuccessfully tried to chew the meat off the bone.  most of the meat was still stuck to the bone.  I did not show the major dissatisfaction that this experience warranted since I now just wanted out! I just stood up and left, belly empty. no second chances. the reason I chose this as my first review is because it left such an impression on me that even years later it still offends me.  sorry to Applebee's if it was the young staff that caused this mishap, but it is still inexcusable. so, i've been to this location a few times with not nearly as awful of an experience.  steak is always good, staff is accommodating and friendly.  I just hope that I was the only victim of the I-can't-believe-it's-not-cheese-dip scandal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norristown-4?start=20
