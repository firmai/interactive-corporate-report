51,K W.,"St Paul, OR",0,22,,3.0,2015-09-11,"I and my wife were invited to the pre-opening practice run.  We went for lunch on the very first practice day.  The place was busy, and everything seemed to be running smoothly.  Service was friendly and great.  Food was well prepared, served quickly, and tasted good. We were seated in the bar area on stools at one of the tiny high tables  Very noisy in there due to the small space and proximity to the kitchen.  Virtually impossible to carry on any conversation.  Even the wait staff had to raise their voices to be understood.  Definitely not the place to enjoy a meal due to the noise, and constant foot traffic by our table.  I and my wife were getting bumped by everyone going by. Still way better than the Red Robin in Salem over by Lancaster Mall.  Lousy food and service at that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

We sat down and waitress told us they just open today, they didn't even have any signs outside! Anyways, our waitress Britney was very nice, few details on the menu she didn't know and she got the answers right away. We got Royal and Banzai, burgers came pretty quick, a little disappointing on the size of the burger, it's best if you order appetizers. Another issue I saw was the restroom, super tiny with only 2 toilets, one standing and one sitting, this might be barely enough for building code but for a big restaurant like this they should have at least 2 standing, they had a big closet, management I'm gonna say you need to replace it with a standing stall. Overall good experience, cream soda sucks, their happy hour all day beer is not bad, 22 oz for $4.50 all day(domestic), will probably visit again next time we stop by this outlet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

I probably wouldn't order the seafood platter again as I found it a little too salty and the pumpkin shake was a little gritty, but I enjoyed my fries and peppercorn burger. The berry limeade and freckled lemonade were delicious and the Fruffles were pretty good. Maybe a little heavy on the sea salt.

Red Robin is one of the few places that has healthy kid menu options like grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and fresh fruit. They also have salads and burgers and everything in between so generally the whole family is happy when we come here.  Since it's opened, we have been here twice. The first time we went in for the soft opening with our toddler and had a great meal. Our waitress was awesome, the food and drinks were perfect and we had a great time. I would give it 5 stars if not for the super confused and slightly rude hostess we encountered when we first came in. Our second visit was very much the same. We came in on a busy Saturday, crazy we know but that's what everyone wanted. We were told it was a 35 minute wait, I said ok! The hostess looked at me for a few seconds then asked, so do you still want to eat here? I was a little surprised, and said yes of course! That's why I am here! She put our name down, then told me it would be 25 minutes. I sat down ready to wait 35 minutes when I got a text telling me our table was ready! It had only been a few minutes so I went up thinking it may have been an error. The hostess ignored me but a waitress explained that our table was being cleaned. In another minute we were seated!

Our waitress handed all the drinks and food to one of us at the table and had him hand out the food and drinks. Then when she began cleaning the table she spilled the plates and cups on one of our kids. Not one apology. And worse of all she tried to act like it didn't happen. It wasn't till I asked for a manager that she informed her supervisor. Then the manager comes out and still no apology. All she cared about was a lawsuit and asked our kid if he was going to be a ""tough guy"" and hoping he doesn't go to the hospital. So I wrote a letter to the corporate office where all I got was a simple ""where sorry and hope you come back"" response. We won't be coming back to the one in woodburn!

I only said ""bunless"" Banzai burger - which was a terrible mistake. My burger came in with no buns, and no lettuce wrap either... That never happened before.

31,D. A.,"Eagle Creek, OR",0,5,,1.0,2017-04-20,"Very disappointed in our visit to Red Robin in Woodburn, Oregon April 16.2017. It was to a point we almost left and didn't want to leave a tip. We had a party of 6. We were seated then asked to move to another table. When ordering drinks I asked for coffee. I was told we have no coffee today. I was so shocked I thought this was a joke. Then I said ""what""!? I was told ""we are out of coffee filters"" I asked for water instead. I ordered a Garden Burger. It had some BBQ sauce on it. Yuck. not Dijon as advertised. When the bill was delivered we were asked then if we wanted more fries. We were ready to leave at that point. Ketchup container almost empty. Table kiosk didn't work. The waiters were as nice as they could be. I felt sorry for them. What happened to Red Robin. We spent $72.50. Not interested in going back.  As of 05-05-17.  I have not heard back from corporate.

11,Jason M.,"Happy Valley, OR",47,2,,1.0,2017-04-26,"Let me be clear to start. I love Red Robin Burgers. But I literally just walked out of this Red Robin right after being seated because of the absolute rudeness of the hostess. We asked if there was open seating in the Bar and we were told she has to seat us and if a high top was ok. We said yes and when we got to the bar all the seating available was in the center of the room and quite crowded, we noticed there were two booths in the bar area against the back bar wall and asked if we could sit there. Her response was ""I guess, but I'd prefer you sit at a table to keep the servers area tight"". Uh what? I'm not sure, A) why you would convey this to a customer, making them feel uncomfortable for asking for a booth, B) complain about seating a customer literally 3 feet away from the original table and C) trying to force customers into a crowded area that would add to server congestion.  The hostess, after seating us, then proceeds to walk over to the bartender less the 2 feet from us and complain about us asking to sit in the booth. To the bartenders credit he didn't seem to understand what the big deal was, but she continued for a good minute to rant on about us, right in front of us.  That's when we made the decision to leave.  I will enjoy Red Robin Burgers in the future, just never again at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
27,Kelsey M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,14,,2.0,2017-05-14,"Normally visiting a Red Robin is a pretty enjoyable experience. No, the food isn't stellar, but it's good and reasonably priced. This is the third time visiting this particular location and by far my worse experience at any of their locations ever. We were five people seated at a four top, but we made it work. We weren't given enough silverware or napkins, even after asking. Thankfully we had food we could eat with our hands. We had an AWFUL waitress, Meg? May? Something like that. I'm not sure because she only mumbled it once and didn't have a name tag on. Anyway, she was CLEARLY uninterested in serving anyone and did not seem to give two shits about her job. When taking our drink orders she didn't ask if we wanted appetizers or if we were ready to order food. We tried to tell her we wanted an appetizer but she simply walked away after the last drink order. When she came back with the drinks we mentioned wanting onion rings. She ROLLED HER EYES and said, ""Well do it on that."" and pointed to the little tabletop tablet thing. At first, we didn't hear her clearly so we asked ""what?"" to try and clarify. She once again rolled her eye and audibly sighed. She the picked up the tablet thingy and placed the onion ring order for us, then slammed the tablet back down, walking away without saying anything else. When the onion rings came out we were not given plates, so we sort of made makeshift plates on our napkins. Yes, we asked for them, twice, but never got them. When she returned to take our orders, she didn't ask if we wanted any dipping sauces for our fries (sort of a staple of RR), nor offered to bring refills on drinks until we asked. Also, not a huge deal, but I've noticed at every other RR I've been to they offer to bring fries out early (if you've ordered something with the bottomless fries), but of course she didn't. We were too scared to ask. Our food finally came out, delivered by two different waiters. It was fine, but not great. My fish and chips were soggy and greasy, my brother's burger was over cooked and dry, and my dad's plate had about 4 French fries. Whatever, we moved on. When a third waiter stopped to ask if we needed anything I requested ranch for my fries, since we didn't get any offered before. He brought that pretty promptly. About 1/3 of the way through our meal Happy May/Meg returned and said, ""I'm going on break. I can either cash you out now or hand you to another server."" We opted to cash out and asked her to split the bill. She once again huffed through that process on the tabletop tablet (which we could have done ourselves when we were ready to pay at the end of our meal but she was determined to have us do it right then). All in all, it was an underwhelming experience thanks to the waitstaff. Probably will avoid this location again due to that. I'd rather eat worse food Elmer's next door and have good service than be back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
7,Raedetta C.,"Clatskanie, OR",2,12,4.0,1.0,2017-05-20,"Walked in to a crowded lobby, which is often typical for Red Robin. We checked in with the hostess and asked to sit in the bar, to which she replied that all the tables were on the waitlist and we'd have to get on the list. We put our names on the list and was told a 10-15 minute wait, which wasn't bad considering it was just about 5:15 pm on a Saturday. The hostess (no name tag, big hair) actually appeared annoyed that people were coming in.  We actually waited over 20 minutes to be seated and during that time we counted at least 4 two-tops, 2 four-tops, and a six-top open.   We were seated at a two-top that had been open the entire time we were waiting. The served did come over promptly and get our drink order. When drinks were delivered we ordered our appetizer at the same time as our meals.   The server put the app order in the table tablet (That wasn't at the table) and wrote down our orders.  Our appetizer just arrived and it was missing the sauce and we finally got appetizer plates after they were taken to another table that already had some. Our orders came out, the other person was missing the dipping sauce and had a full bun when she asked for half.  The food was typical for Red Robin.  When it came time to pay, even though we could have split the check, the server split it for us on the machine, which we had to redo so we could enter a rewards number.  When it was time for the second person to pay, we had to call the server  (actually flag him down) to get some help so we could enter a different rewards number. He went in the back to reset it, but we still couldn't pay and had to wave him down again to ask him to take cash.

I sat at the bar and there was only 1 other person sitting at the bar. I sit there for 5 minutes and realized the waitress/barmaid wasn't coming over so I finally asked her for a rag to clean the counter (it was filthy), she leaned over and cleaned the counter...sort of  As she was cleaning I asked for a drink After the drink came I sit there at least another 5 minutes until I finally got her attention to ask for a menu. This is the best part... after I closed the menu , it's obvious I'm ready to order, she's talking to someone it appears she knows and completely ignores me. After 12 minuets and I'm not exaggerating another waitress was making drinks in front of where I was sitting so I asked her for a salad.
