Tara H.,"Henrico, VA",94,172,404,4.0,3/12/2016,"This was my first time at this location. The food was hot and prepared as ordered.  The waitstaff were very friendly and attentive.  While this location isn't as big as some, it does have more seating than some locations that I have gone to.  This location isn't far from interstate 95 and near downtown Wilson.  There's shopping, has, car dealers, etc. nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Jill M.,"Raleigh, NC",49,163,529,2.0,11/10/2017,"""Nothing special,"" as the waitress described their Bloody Marys. Which I ordered anyway, and it was as promised, nothing special. I didn't realize when you sit at a table at the bar and order drinks from a waitress, that you have to retrieve your drinks from the bar, like you work there. My waitressing days are behind me and I do hope Wilson gets a few more restaurant/bar choices where two old friends and stop in and chat over a drink, which is somewhere above mediocre. I don't think I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Susan O.,"Wilson, NC",12,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"This was an incredibly bad experience.  I ordered a rare steak.  It was not even warm, and so raw I could not chew it.  Poor cut.  The roasted tomatoes were cherry tomatoes, and merely warm.  The toasted garlic was raw.  The fresco salad was overdressed, and soaked with dressing.  The grilled avocado was actually good as were the panko onion rings.  Turned out I paid over $20.00 for avocado and onion rings.  Will not be returning,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
William D.,"Rocky Mount, NC",0,3,,1.0,9/5/2017,"There were ants when we were seated crawling everywhere around the table and the only course of action was to move us to the next table to where we just had the ants,  highly unpleasant,  the food was cold,  there was almost no chicken on our quesadillas and I specifically oreded my drink with no ice,  all things that could have went wrong did and its worth me creating a yelp to help people avoid this atrocious place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Gissel E.,"Princeton, NC",0,12,2,1.0,1/15/2017,"VERY SLOW SERVICE. Whenever I walked in me and my husband just kind of stood around because the hostess was not around to welcome us or anything. Finally the person noticed and immediately sat us down. Only thing is, our waitress really only came to our table a couple of times and we had to wait a while to get some things for our appetizers. Our entrees literally took over 50 minutes to  cook... it got to the point that we just simply asked for our meals to be boxed up because we couldn't wait any longer. Granted it was busy, but the service was terrible. Either this establishments needs to have more people on board or needs to reevaluate their employees. Definitely disappointed with this trip to chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Crystal F.,"Rolesville, NC",64,8,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Worst lunch ever!   After waiting 40 min for soup and salad, my soup was tepid and I only had five minutes to eat.  Very very poor service today, wish I had walked out after 39 min!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Awake W.,"Wilson, NC",1,45,,3.0,6/18/2016,Chili's will never be known for their fish tacos - however the staff is super nice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Rj B.,"Dalton, GA",125,524,456,2.0,2/23/2015,"Hmmm, you should keep driving. My chicken tenders had more salt than the Dead Sea. My French fries were soft and mushy. Yum! (That was a sarcastic yum). I ordered the Mac n cheese  and I guess they spiced them up with jalapeños. I couldn't eat more than two bites of it. It was over cooked, so on top of tasting pretty bad, it was mushy. My gf ordered the sirloin because they were out of ribeyes. She ordered medium rare and it was well done. Yuck! It's like eating leather at this point. She also ordered rice and it was standard. The broccoli she ordered was so undercooked it was tough to cut with the crappy steak knife. Unless your car is out of gas, just keep moving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
E S.,"Cedar Park, TX",1,43,5,1.0,10/9/2016,"I come to Wilson often.  3rd attempt at this chilis and last.  Two previous attempts they could not get order right and good not good.  This attempt.  I walk up to door on 10/9 and on door says ""closing at 9 due to inclement weather"".  I walk at 8.42pm.  Sit st bar.  Place is packed.  They come over at 8.45 and tell me they are closed.   Kitchen is closed.  I asked really?   ""Yes"".  They were nice.  I asked what is he ""inclement weather"", figuring they would have something to do with flooding or something.  The response was ""we have problems"".   Again, I said really. ""Yes sir.  Sorry"".   Just a strange place.  Went to the next Resturant next door.  No problems.  Had a very good meal.  I think here is a lot more going on here.  No good.  Why have a sign that has two lies.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Tia D.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",8,154,52,3.0,7/3/2015,"Stopped in for an appetizer and margaritas; ordered on the rocks with salt, weak pour, I had to order a shot to kick it up, service was good, the bartender was being pushed to the limit but he persevered and delivered in a timely manner. I had the new smokey wings and steamed broccoli, both were good 2 go, smokey flavored and tender, the wings were delicious, the broccoli was fresh, a lil salt and butter to enhance the flavor & I had a decent meal for the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Lee H.,"Wilson, NC",41,34,4,1.0,4/21/2014,Do yourself a favor and go to Texas Steakhouse or Ruby Tuesday's!! This is the 2nd time we have come in and they have been out of something!! They first tell us they are out of the Southwestern Egg rolls which we were wanting but to take the cake they were out of Coke!! YES Coca-Cola!!!! What kind of place do we have here!! This Chili's needs a NEW manager that knows how to order and run a real resturant!!! What a joke of a place in Wilson!!!! No wonder this place is never busy!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Jenny C.,"Wilmington, NC",2,13,9,2.0,4/19/2015,Stopped due to lack of options with part of our soccer team. Don't go if your in a hurry. Poor waitress just could not get it right. We could have ordered fixed and checked out faster by doing it all ourselves. Staff quality poor,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
David W.,"Bailey, NC",2,35,4,1.0,11/24/2015,The most incompetent group of people I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. Please please please don't waste ur time at this place. Everyone around me is really pissed off. Our waiter Paul acted like he could care less.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Dave H.,"Youngsville, NC",55,29,27,5.0,6/16/2014,"We've been coming here for many years and have always been satisfied. Clean, great staff, good food, cold beer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
Mamta K.,"New York, NY",0,47,13,3.0,1/27/2011,"Stopped here driving back to NYC from FL. Friendly wait staff. Standard Chilis menu though the sweet corn soup was delicious. They wouldn't accommodate us with Veggie Fajitas though. Which was very strange since every other Chilis we've been to has no problem accommodating us. After all, they would just have to give us the Fajitas vegetables minus meat. Oh well.  Three stars because the soup was delicious, and salad very fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilson-2
