Marilia M.,"Burnaby, Canada",35,22,37,4.0,8/19/2017,I LOVE red robin for many reasons. They have a wide selection of items so you're definitely going to find something that sounds appetizing.  They offer bottomless fries which is always great.  Their burgers are DELICIOUS! I always try a different one when I go and it's a great place to bring friends and family. Their salted caramel milkshake blew my mind. Their onion rings appetizer is really great for sharing and so are their Chinese ribs (I think that's what they were called).  If you visit red robin a lot make sure to sign up for their loyalty program to take advantage of their great offers,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Vitor L.,"New Haven, CT",7,52,17,3.0,11/4/2017,"We've been here two times, the good was good in one of them and quite bad in the other.  Service and the atmosphere were always good. I really enjoyed the Smoke and pepper burger. On the other hand, the mushroom burger was very soggy and unappealing. My wife ate the gluten-free burger, which was just ok. Their GF bun is not too bad, but it's difficult to find a GF burger sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",323,1272,,5.0,8/17/2017,"Our family's experience at this Red Robin site was terrific! We just moved here from the Seattle area and are used to our local RR (in Redmond, WA). I was skeptical that this downtown site would be as good as our old hometown site that we know and love. We were pleasantly surprised: this RR was definitely as good or perhaps even better than our old hang-out in the States! We opted to walk the stairs to the outdoor patio deck, as it was a hot and sunny day. What a great outdoor venue up here! And our server was the nicest guy EVER (damn if I can remember his name, though. He was from Bellingham, WA, though, so we chatted a bit about  Seattle and Washington state).  We loved how our American RR rewards card (and all our points) were transferable/usable here in Canada, too. Much of the menu was the same (which is a good thing!), including their bottomless fries and refillable freckled lemonade. There was a lovely girl who kept bringing my kid more fries and lemonade before we even asked her. The server staff here was incredibly on the ball. (The only difference I recall on the menu was the addition of poutine here. My kids thought that SO cool! We didn't order it, though; it will have to wait for next time). Love the fact that they still offer the free birthday burgers here. Oh, and I opted to have a salad which was definitely larger and, dare I say it, better than the RR salads back in the States. (Our American RR restaurants ""updated"" their interiors and their menus the past few years and the salads were changed - not for the better, IMO. But here they were as they used to be back home: larger, fresh, delicious. Easily shared by two people).  Great place for families. Great menu. Great patio. Great service (super nice servers). Great reward program. Great location downtown. Just.....great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Simon S.,"Burnaby, Canada",114,384,1553,4.0,7/18/2017,"Went with a friend to redeem my Red Robin Royalty free birthday burger (comes with the usual bottomless fries!). As I was feeling like I had had too much meat recently, I went for the Garden Burger which, sad to say, is just OK, and that's if you immediately take out the pickles so you don't just taste pickles. Do NOT come to Red Robin for their veggie burger even if you do a patty swap. For approximately the same price (sometimes LESS) you can get a way more interesting and tasty burger (but with a meat patty). Contrary to my way-back-when experience, to redeem my birthday burger all I needed to do was give them the phone number attached to my account and confirm which burgers were part of the promo. No fuss at all. However, my friend got the Veggie Fajita, and OMG it was totally not what we were expecting -- in a good way. Generous almost for-two portion for $14.99, and although they start you off with about 4 wraps, it is clearly not enough and you can get free refills. Veggies are cheap (it looked like mostly onions) and clearly they don't skimp on it maybe because they can. NON-alcoholic drinks are big-portioned and cheap! My Coconut Pineapple Smoothie was just $4.69 and pretty tall. Heck, even the water is jumbo sized so they don't even have to come around and refill it because you are unlikely to drink it down to even half. Cronuts are OK, though sweet and a bit oily-feeling so personally I don't like them much. The main thing about them though is they are light and airy. If you are thinking of trying them but feeling full, just get the short 4-stack and you'll be fine as there's no way they are gonna fill you up. Friendly service, great value",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Sammy Y.,"North Vancouver, Canada",53,42,98,4.0,9/22/2017,"#BringBackChainRestaurants!!!! Considering VanCity is very hippie-dippie with its obsession with organic, 'gluten-free', picture-friendly foods, good chain restaurants like RedRobin is dying out. Their burgers are great! The bottomless fries are thick & well-done! The bottomless FreckledLemonade is a classic!

Stephy Y.,"Richmond, Canada",103,515,1238,4.0,11/25/2016,"This is my second time at this location. The service was amazing this time around. Our drinks were refilled at a timely manner. Our food did take a bit long but it tasted better than the last and possibly better than the first time I tried RB. We came for the Tavern Tuesday which is buy two beverages and a burger, entree or entree salad and get a double double tavern burger free.  We ordered: Popping purple lemonade (3/5-$4.69): They use their famous tornado glass to serve this drink and it was pretty. I'm not a huge lemonade fan but it'll do. It's more on the sweet side than sour. Raspberry syrup is used, hence the purple. Raspberry cream soda (3.5/5-$4.69): A bit sweet but it liked that they actually add some whipped cream with a cherry on top.  The big sky (4/5-$17.69): A bit pricey but it tasted   was served in a ciabatta bun, had an onion ring, bacon, the patty and goat cheese. Not sure if I missed anything else that was in there. It's a bit smaller than I expected too.  Bleu Ribbon (4/5-$12.69): My go to burger at RB. Didn't know blue cheese would go so well in a burger. But I remember requesting for blue cheese in my burger elsewhere and it was awful so RB it is if I want this kinda burger.  Double Double Tavern (3/5): Reminds of a McD cheeseburger but then again I haven't had McD since I was a kid so.....this is how far my memory goes. Not a bad burger. You do get double patties. Not sure if it's worth the deal though. You might as well get this if you plan to order drinks and you don't mind simplicity.  --- First time: Onion Ring Tower (3/5): I know a lot of people raved about this but other than it's served in a tower, I didn't see or taste anything different from the onion rings at another place.  Mad Love Burger (2.5/5): Can't quite remember what was in this but it was limited edition and my friend decided to get this. All I remember was it didn't taste good and was on the dry side. Don't see this on the menu anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Lisa Marie M.,"Vancouver, Canada",1510,502,4163,2.0,2/13/2017,"Very disappointing.  After having a great experience in Bellingham, we went in expecting the same. Sadly it wasn't meant to be.  The elevator up to this location is dirty and sketchy, although the location is great. We just had to wait a few minutes before being seated.  The server was quick to offer us drinks. They were out of the beer special. So they offered another kind, and my husband decided to go with that. My cocktail was overly sweet, and couldn't really taste any alcohol.  I ordered the steak fajitas. I asked for no onions, and was told that it might not be possible. I said if not I would pick them out. My husband ordered the Bonzai burger with the bottomless fries.  The fajitas came and they were over 60% onions ! The green peppers were actually grey, and the steak was awful. I could totally tell this came out of some sort of frozen package, it was defiantly not fresh - I guess this is the reason they couldn't take the onions out. When I told the server, she asked I I wanted to order something else. I did - and that too contained onions as well ! I was so mad at this point. A manager came over. She ended up taking both items off the cheque and comping my drink, but I left still hungry and completely frustrated !  I don't know how or why this place went downhill so bad. #neveragain",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Belinda J.,"Calgary, Canada",39,149,1120,5.0,6/29/2017,"I have gone to Red Robin for dinner with my friends and co-worker couple times. We had dinners in different locations every time but most were the downtown branch.  It was always super busy and had to wait for a table. I remembered we had to wait about one hour to get a table one time. So, you should go there early before the lunch/dinner time. Once we sat down, service was pretty good and fast. The restaurant is large and has lots of space inside. Once we sat down, service was pretty good and fast. The menu looks very fancy and easier to order food by looking at the colorful image on the menu. The food came very fast. They were fresh and tasty with large portions.  Prices are reasonable.

Dave M.,"Vancouver, Canada",78,182,222,4.0,2/17/2017,"If you like to good old american style burger, then Red Robin at Robson is a good place to hit up. This chain has been here for a while and is suprisingly very busy considering most Vancouverite likes the traditional small unique restaurants. My experience here has always been great. The vibe is cool, the service is fast and the food is good. Let me elaborate. Vibe: Restaurant full of knick knacks as decor. Visually appealing. TV's all over the place, you can always catch the game. Lots of windows seats perfect for oeople watching while waiting for food. Service: I had several bad service, fries came out wrong and water was not refilled on time, and just slow service. Could be based on short staff but ill be a harsh critic. Food: Here is the best part. Lots of choices! I'm a simple guy who likes a simple burger. I've gotten the grilled chicken and the red tavern burgers. Both were so delicious that I've devoured it in a few bites. But thats not the best part. The regular fries or the garlic fries are super awesome! Crispy fresh, well seasoned and unlimited, it's really what brings me back to this place. Overall, my experience here has been A+. I always recommend anyone to try it out. It's not for everyone but it is for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Vickie Y.,"Coquitlam, Canada",85,11,18,5.0,1/28/2017,"Conveniently located in the heart of downtown Vancouver near shopping area, I came here to redeem my birthday reward from being a member of their rewards program!  The burgers red robins serve are huge and super delicious! I always find myself not being able to finish and having to take out at least half of my burger. Fries are bottomless and can be refilled as many times as you want which is a huge plus. I love adding their signature red robin powder on the potato wedge fries. It has a unique taste to it - a sweet BBQ kick! I tried the pacific wild salmon burger and was very satisfied as the salmon was not too dry and still soft. There was just a bit too much sauce in my opinion, but other than that it was good.  Restaurant has an old vibe to it and service was exceptional! The waiter serving us was very nice and even refilled our fries without us asking.  Will definitely come back to try the other gourmet burgers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver

Matt L.,"Vancouver, Canada",11,6,1,1.0,10/9/2016,"My wife and I ordered takeout from red robin last night and were seriously disappointed. We ordered a salad, a burger and a spinach dip appetizer as well as a French onion soup. The salad came with no dressing at all, the burger had no lettuce, tomato or second patty that I paid for, as well, the bottom bun was already falling apart from sogginess by the time it got home, I love less than 10min from the restaurant. The fries were so undercooked they were barely edible. The spinach dip was about a two ounce portion, enough for about 6 chips. Finally the French onion soup came with two tiny sticks of garlic bread that were burnt black on one side. The manager's response?  ""Not her problem"" Disclaimer: did order through an outside delivery company that ive used over 20 times. However we clarified that the order was correctly placed with the restaurant and that should not effect the quality of the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver
Hungry Kitt Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",12,149,234,4.0,6/11/2016,"Red Robin' is like a favorite armchair - comfortable and reliable, with no attitude.  Downtown is filling up with lots of high -end,  designer restaurants, that are OK to visit once in a while, as a treat. But how much am I really willing to pay for someone else's decor?  Red Robin's maintains a relaxed,  comfortable environment and gourmet burgers at a reasonable price.  With endless pop and fries, no one walks away hungry or disappointed.  My whiskey burger was stacked so high, I used a fork and knife to cut it down to size. I love the classic whiskey sauce and the bacon and crispy onions put this burger over the top. It's hard to pick a favorite,  but this is one I like to turn to when I can't decide. My only complaint is that the bun falls apart too easily under the weight of the burger. They should consider a better quality bun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver

I have to be honest I frequent the down town location it has a great roof top patio (will try and snag a picture my next visit).   They also have a great happy hour!!! Tasty appies and weekly cocktail specials.  I rate Red Robin as a much better happy hour location than Cactus Club and better food than Earls hands down.  I always eat the Terriyaki Chicken burger.  A juicy perfectly cooked chicken breast with a sweet pineapple ring on top.  It is a messy burger but so worth it!!!

Danielle K.,"Vancouver, Canada",111,185,444,4.0,11/12/2015,"Red Robin has been one of my fave go-to burger joints for casual dining over the years. This location overlooks Robson Street and has a great view of all the hustle & bustle that goes on along Vancouver's famous downtown shopping street.  I have been here countless times over the years and have tried many different menu items, but 2 items stand out as my most loved: the popcorn shrimp, and the Royal Red Robin burger. The popcorn shrimp is such a delicious bite-sized appetizer to snack on that it'll be all gone before you even notice! The Royal Red Robin burger has everything I love in a burger: beef, bacon, cheese, and egg! I mean, how can you even go wrong with that?  I love the fact that the fries are thick cut & refillable as many times as you want. Bottomless fries food coma.. Mmmm! The shakes here taste pretty decent too. I recommend getting the larger size as this gives you the remainder that's inside the large shake canister, in addition to what gets poured out to fill your glass.

Evan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",129,128,135,3.0,8/28/2015,"Thank you to Simon S for the heads up on RR's birthday club.  I came for a meal this week before the Whitecaps game with coupon in hand for my free b-day burger. This was my first visit to any Red Robin, and I found the place filled with families.  You have to walk up some steps to get to the restaurant, but it is quite visible from Robson street.  As you crest the steps you'll be in their patio area, which is quite large, and just through the doors takes you into the main dining area. Service was a little cold to start as there wasn't anyone to greet me, and I had to wait a few minutes before someone came over.  They have several TV screens inside but they are all small and not viewing friendly.  As much as I wanted to watch the Jays game, I opted for a seat on the patio instead.   My server came over quickly to introduce herself and detail the drink specials.  Of note, the $4 Shocktop cocktail sounded particularly good.  She took my coupon and showed me which burgers on the menu were eligible for the promotion.  I appreciated her genuinely helpful suggestions to help make up my mind.   No more than ten minutes after I'd ordered, my salmon burger arrived.  I liked the presentation of the meal.  The two burger halves were separated and on one of the buns there was a large dollop of coleslaw and red onion.  It's supposed to have tartar sauce and cilantro-lime dressing, but I couldn't really taste them. I wished the burger had more of a distinct flavour, as the plain salmon was what shone through - the burger was just OK..  As for the fries, they were aesthetically pleasing and nicely salted but strangely they were not all the same temperature nor were they all that fresh.  It was a small serving of fries, maybe only  fifteen or twenty at the very most,.  I would have ordered more had the waitress come to ask as they do advertise ""bottomless steak fries"" with their meals. The waitress was wholly absent after serving the meal.  My coupon might explain that, or perhaps it was getting busier inside.  I was a little surprised given how warm and friendly she was before I'd placed my order.  I found the patio nice and quiet, but for the 'safe/inoffensive' music playing quietly on the speakers and the traffic driving past. I'll admit - I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants to begin with.  Overall, I found Red Robin to be nothing fancy.  I probably wouldn't take a date there for anything other than a drink or two, and certainly it wouldn't be my first choice to impress.  It seems like a safe choice for families looking for a decent sit-down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=20

Matthew R.,"Vancouver, Canada",391,278,47,4.0,1/20/2016,"The first thing you see is how much of literally everything there is on the wall. Road signs, Andy Warhol quotes, Sports on TV, an old school bar, and full sized windows. The first question you ask is ""how is this restaurant actually still here?!,"" and with the closing of the Broadway location it is a fair and legitimate question. Red Robins is trapped in a decade where snarky ad copy and ridiculous portions were the trend, but now it's almost like they want to be cool ironically.  My favourite piece of ad copy: ""smirnoff ice: the start of a good thing."" Like I literally don't know a single good thing that has ever started with a smirnoff ice.  I actually do appreciate the awesome service, the bottomless sides, cheap beer, and decent burger.

Bleu ribbon burger was SO GOOD. tangy and flavorful. like, out of this world good.  ""sriracha burger"" was smaller in portion size and tasted OK. my friend still regretted buying it. our server was all smiles and service was only a eye contact and a ""hello!"" away. they asked how our meal was every so often too. great. on the other hand, our other server promised to come back with fries when i asked but never came. same server asked if i was ready to pay as i was still obviously eating which was kinda rude. the tables were stickier than I'm used to. at least the washrooms were clean. typical american style atmosphere. ceiling tv's to watch a sports game. wide windows so you can see downtown streets from the second floor makes for a nice view. plastered on the wall are some western style decor that gives this place some personality. Sure, i'll come back here again but it won't be my first choice.

My boyfriend and I started our meal off with ""adult""  freckled lemonades, as they call them and mine was a bit strong. Our wonderful waiter (I think his name was Adrian) asked me if i was enjoying my drink and I told him it was a bit strong so he offered to get me an extra cup of lemonade (and he filled it with the strawberries too! yum). It helped dilute the drink a bit which i very much appreciated. When we ordered our food our server was very keen to give us suggestions and was helping me decide what to eat, he was very knowledgeable about the menu. And the food came out SO quick! He was very attentive too. When our fries were looking a bit empty he offered to go get us some more and came back very shortly with a big basket of the bottomless fries. Sometimes I have found at Red Robin in the past that they are quite stingy with their ""bottomless"" fries but Adrian wasnt stingy at all!

One of my favourite things about this location is the great view you have of Robson and Thurlow.  You can watch everyone slave away in the rat race while you enjoy your food.  Oh, and there's a great covered patio out back. Today I had a Red Chili Chili Burger.  They suggest that you use a knife and fork, and they are absolutely right.  The chili was quite heavy, with plenty of diced red onions.  I've also had other burgers here, but the one that always sticks out is the Whiskey RIver BBQ Burger.  The sauteed onions are to die for. I've had their strawberry lemonade and this thing is good.  However, you can also tell it's been sweetened quite a bit, so hopefully you don't end up like Steve Jobs after having a few of these.  Bottomless drinks always feel good.  The staff are quite good with the refills.  They give you a replacement before you actually run out.

Carol L.,"Vancouver, Canada",118,344,8,4.0,11/2/2012,"Red Robin calls for no occasion. Could you ever go wrong with burgers, Steak cut fries and smoothies? Probably not.  Up a flight of stairs, tucked away in a dodgy corner from a fast take-out White Spot is our downtown Red Robin. Despite it's unimpressive entrance, the interior makes every adult feel like a not-so-grown-up adult again! All the times we've been there, the service has been quite fast. Even during rush hours and special holidays, the seating moves reasonably quickly. A new discovery made here during my last visit is that reservations are welcome. The no-reservations impression must have come from somewhere, but it is gladly mistaken.  The most impressive burger by far, in my opinion, has to be the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. That is with the exception that your taste buds agree completely with BBQ sauce. Loaded with onion straws -- my favourite! -- and smothered with smokey, sweet BBQ sauce, the Whiskey River is the burger to try if you have not! The rest of the burgers on the menu are probably exceptionally delightful in their own way, but I can only tell so much about the one burger because I am boring like that; I get the same burger every time.  The next highlight is bottomless fries. Not just any fries... Steak cut fries! They have this Red Robin house seasoning on every table that is to kill for. The seasoning is a red-ish colour, contained in a Red Robin shaker bottle. Some may disagree with my verdict, because the smell and taste of the added spices are quite strong. Here's another tip: Honey Mustard with Poppy Seeds!!! I am a sucker for sauce. I love sauce. Very much. This has got to be the best honey mustard I've ever tasted! Be it the poppy seeds or simply my sauce addiction, we can all agree that you have GOT TO TRY IT!  It's a shame they stopped giving away the humongous slice of dessert for birthdays now. It was a treat for everyone to visit on their birthdays and be humiliated, standing on a chair while they announce your age to the entire restaurant, all in the spirit of knowing that there's a huge slice of dessert at the end of the tunnel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=60

Ramon V.,"Vancouver, Canada",128,391,101,4.0,11/4/2011,"Red Robin, I will never hate you. Others have tried to convince me otherwise, but I shun their negativity. From my first visit to the old Thurlow and Alberni location, I was hooked. Back then, I had only lived here for a short time, and it was my first restaurant experience in Vancouver. I was 17. It took care of of my teen business like you wouldn't believe. I remember my first order. A Big-mouth burger with fries, Pepsi and a Monster mud pie. The Pepsi and fries were bottomless. I was speechless.  I grew up, I progressed into university, got used to enjoying their hot wings, onion rings, milkshakes, then onto beer, the gooey cheese sticks, the southwestern salad, fajitas, and pretty much tried everything else on the menu over the years. Nothing's changed at Red Robin. They'll get some flack for it, but the decor is still relatively the same. I don't mind it. It's a fond reminder of a more care-free time. Perhaps you'd had to have experienced the joys of a Red Robin trip as a young'un to appreciate the predictability and safeness of the menu 20+ years later. It's a staple. I always know that there'll be no surprises. If there's a problem, they'll try to fix it. I love bringing my little niece here, and I love bringing my parents here. It's a no-brainer when those types of demographics are at play.  Apart from a couple of bad experiences relating solely to the inexperience of individual staff, or forgivable mistakes in the kitchen, there have been no major shortfalls over the years in the customer experience. It's not fine dining, but it's not without an attempt at good service either. Think of it as a training ground for young staff, and with a consistent menu. If you need a reason to change your mind, here are a few: The Onion Rings. Yes, capital letters. I don't think anyone does it better. Actually I'll stand behind this. I think they are the best in town, bar none. And they make me giggle out loud when that tower arrives at the table. The patio on Oak Street is amongst the best in the area. A variety of burgers that few places can match. This coming from a not-so-big fan of burgers. Bottomless pop and fries. The menu has been re-incarnated in a slightly shrunken form several times since those first visits I made. I did not like the removal of the Eggs Broadway burger a decade ago, but so be it. Most restaurants make much more dramatic changes over that period of time. As for the appeals to renovate, be careful what you wish for. Do you really want Red Robin to become the next Cactus Club? I say tidy it up, keep dusting off those airbrushed posters of  Duck Tales and the Lamborghini Countach and if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=60

Theresa W.,"Mississauga, Canada",114,546,395,4.0,3/12/2012,"Oh man, if you knew how many calories were in a burger, you'd be sad-faced too. But if you can look past that, Red Robin is a delicious burger joint and well worth the $10 meal.  Located in the busy area of Robson & Thurlow, this place is great for people watching - especially with a bottomless freckled lemonade if you're up for the $5 splurge. And for a share starter, nothing brings more delight to the eyes of old and young alike as the onion ring tower (campside bbq sauce is the best!).  Burgers here are DELISH. The menu has several staples (including the Royal Robin burger with a fried egg), but my favourites are the bonzai, california, or whiskey river burger. Service here is awesome as well, they add onion straws to my burger at no extra charge and they can bring it out on a plate and cut in half for you if you know you'll be taking some of it home. Bottomless fries (the fatty kind though, I'm more a fan of thin fries), or a side salad (not bottomless) completes your meal. Those not looking for beef can also choose from the veggie patty options, or the chicken or salmon burgers. Or if you're really not feeling burgers, they've got salads, fajitas, chicken fingers, and more.  The place is big, roomy, but really busy during lunch on the weekends. I recommend this place to visitors who are looking for some regular burgers or fast food. :) It's a safe option every time, and good value for a filling meal in downtown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=60

It tasted quite good though--I will likely opt for the lettuce bun again in the future. The cod was also very tasty, though I think some extra tartar sauce would have made it better.

It was to runny, when it should be thicker and made with more cheese . The clucks and greens haven't changed much but aren't as great as other chicken strips such as the ones at cactus. The fries are still good and their tartar sauce is amazingly good. It tastes pretty close to McDonald's tartar sauce. The cheesecake is fabulous though they are stingy with the fruit topping. We also ordered the mud pie, which was not good. They've changed it. It no longer has peanut butter on it.  It's just icecream and chocolate.

The place is usually crowded with tourists or large groups celebrating birthdays, so expect some noise, but you probably won't need to wait for a table for two.

As a single, I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar which was fine by me. Little did I know it would take 10 minutes for the bartender to even get to me to take my order. A little too much chatting up the waitresses.  Finally came and took my drink order. I have a a think for salted caramel so I couldn't resist their salted caramel shake. I wish I had. They've got the salted part down a little too well, but if I hadn't seen the drizzle for caramel colored syrup on the top, I would never have guessed this was supposed to be a caramel shake.  My burger took another 15 minutes to arrive and it was pretty good. The place is well located (off Robson) although it takes a little work to find the stairs that lead to the second floor venue. The bar seems well stocked for a burger restaurant and I only hope the service is better for the next customer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=40

He noticed that we were a bit upset (nothing to do with Red Robin), and after our meal, he brought us something to cheer us up.

Rotato T.,"Toronto, Canada",2,40,,3.0,12/26/2009,"Red Robin is ok. Really, the word that comes to mind when I think of this place is ""adequate."" It's adequate. The burgers are adequate. The fries are adequate. The service is adequate. The only thing that stands out for me is the strawberry lemonade, which is actually pretty great. But I could probably do that myself at home by cutting up some strawberries and putting them in lemonade, and I just can't seem to think of any other reason to come here instead of, say, White Spot, which is only a few blocks away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=120
Anna W.,"Seattle, WA",142,288,5,3.0,3/28/2010,I find it pretty humorous that I had to go to a Red Robin in Canada to figure out that hanging out in their bar while you're trying to kill some time is a pretty fun and reasonably priced experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=120
