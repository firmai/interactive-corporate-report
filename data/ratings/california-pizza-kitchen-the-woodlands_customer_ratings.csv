There seasonal menu consists of everything but pizza and I was ok with that.  The California Fields Salad, Fire-grilled Ribeye, Hearth Roasted Halibut and the Chicken Picatta were all delicious, but the best part was their new cocktail program. The new cocktails: Executive Decision, California Roots and the Blueberry Ginger Smash are all worth a try.

After the 15 mins she called us for a table in a very rude way, almost mad, to the point I wanted to ask if she was ok. We got to our table and had a really nice young lady as our server.  Our dinner was ok. We have visited other locations and had some of the same items. We were informed that pizza was gonna take a little longer than usual, I was ok with that and the server made sure we had bread and drinks. Also the other items my family ordered were already there at our table. Eventually my pizza came, but to my dissapoitment it was cold, so I didn't enjoyed it much. Server offered to warm it up  when I mentioned to her, but it was kinda late and I didn't wanna wait when my family had alread finished eating. I also ordered a grilled vegetables salad that I didn't enjoy much either as it had a lot of dressing. I shared with my husband and he thought the same. The dressing didn't allow us to enjoy the salad. It had too much dressing, it was overwhelming. Over all the visit was ok. Three things to sum it all up: 1.Terrible hostess, no smile, just plain annoyed face and rude.  2.Great server 3.meh food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands,2.72,2.79,2.79,,2.7620000000000005

The lunch menu can get pretty caloric as a ""lunch pizza"" alone is 600+ calories without the side salad or sandwich. I recently discovered the ""half salad"" option from the regular menu which also serves as a nice lunch option- solid portion less than 12 dollars.   There's a nice patio out back overlooking Hughes waterway and on a nice day it's perfect for a drink or outdoor lunch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-the-woodlands,2.92,2.82,2.82,,2.86
