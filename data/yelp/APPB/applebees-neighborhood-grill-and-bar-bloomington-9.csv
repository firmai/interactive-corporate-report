Serena C.,"Bloomington, IN",4,11,,1.0,7/12/2014,"I walked in, with a party of two and they were incredibly rude. I asked about a to go order and people kept handing me off, or avoiding me. It really felt like I wasn't going to sit down and they thought I wouldn't tip, so they didn't care. Will never go back. What a sad experience, considering I've been to many applebees before and they were always good. Not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9?start=20
Scott P.,"Bloomington, IN",12,1,,1.0,9/4/2015,"I have been a regular for many years, but recently have been turned away by the pomposity and bullying nature of the regular bartender.  I'm not sure whether he's immune from corporate scrutiny or he's been there so long he no longer cares about the lack of decorum he displays towards some,  but the condescending demeanor of (rhymes with yaht) this employee has been over the top.  When recently confronted about his attitude towards me, he was dismissive and even made a rude gesture to further illustrate the above points.  The 2 for 20 deals are not worth the belittling I've experienced as a paying customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9?start=20

The cheapest appetizers in town, and the perfect margarita is literally the most perfect margarita!  Great for all ages. easily the best chain restaraunt in town. also, if you like wings, ask for the ranch chicken sandwich, nothing will prevent and cure a hangover faster, great for college students b/c it is attached to the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9?start=20

Adam N.,"Bloomington, IN",24,139,29,2.0,3/12/2011,"As chain restaurants go, this one is near or at the bottom. The people are nice, and the atmosphere is nice, but I tend to put the quality of food high on the list of why I go to a restaurant. That being said, the food is certainly not the reason to ever visit Applebee's. I had a chicken/pasta dish and my wife had the fish. The appetizers were OK, spinach dip and slightly undercooked cheese sticks. The main courses looked as though they were simply unfrozen or something. There is certainly no true food preparation in the kitchen. Each meal looked like a kit that was assembled. The fish was very oily and nearly inedible. Most of it went to our dogs. The pasta was OK, and the portion of chicken included was negligible. It was, in fact, hidden under the tiny tomato cubes on top. As chains go, there are so many better choices. Let this place be a last resort. If EVERYTHING nearby is full and you are about to pass out from hunger, then Applebee's might fit the bill, but that's about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9?start=20

Tom H.,"London, United Kingdom",0,22,,5.0,8/12/2017,The sirloin steak with shrimp is an absolute showstopper! By far the best steak I've had since coming to the US 3 weeks ago. I can't recommend the food enough! Service was also great and the atmosphere is very welcoming and cosy. Perfect place for a good meal with your family or friends!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9
Oscar W.,"South Bend, IN",0,6,,1.0,10/9/2017,"In Genesis 19, the command is given: ""Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, nor stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, lest you be swept away."" Lot's wife resists the command and looks back. Accordingly she is transformed into a pillar of salt. Such was my experience at the Applebees of Bloomington's college mall.  Earlier in the day I was asked, ""what are you doing tonight?""  ""I'll probably just go and drink alone at an Applebee's,"" I cleverly quipped. Lo and behold, as the evening drew near, I myself drew near the Applebee's. Beyond anthropological curiosity, there is no sound excuse for patronizing an Applebee's. That obvious insight dawned on me the moment I sat down at the signature U-shaped bar and ordered a room-cold coors light. Cost? Retail price of one six-pack coors light, and a chunk of your dwindling dignity.  The coors was operating slower than the sad waitstaff, and it was at this point that I committed yet another misstep. I ordered a burger. Knowing that it's all bagged and microwaved back there, I was relying on the idea that you know what you're getting. There is consistency in these dire pits of American culture. They don't change. The ceiling never rises, it just gets repainted, moving fractionally lower with each new coat.  A mid level manager wearing exceptionally poor-fitting clothing shuffled over to me with what amounted to the worst meal of my entire life. Even he could not pretend to muster the false corporate enthusiasm that usually marks such men. Perhaps his soul remains in tact. Perhaps the shame of this particular transaction had struck him on this particular night. Perhaps there is hope. But, upon the first bite, I learned that there is not. Salt. Pure salt. No other taste. Even the French fries were utterly inedible. I took three bites, asked for a box so as not to seem abjectly impolite, and proceeded to leave the leftovers in my trunk for three weeks. When I threw them away, they were exactly as they had been on the night they were born.  You shouldn't need me to tell you this, but don't come here. As long as we continue to come to franchises like this, they will continue to overcharge their customers and underpay their employees. We facilitate their existence. Think about that next time you're feeling good about yourself.  I award this Applebee's nine and one half thumbs down, as well as the coveted ""Barrel Scraper"" Award.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9

Jennifer F.,"Bloomington, IN",31,28,34,1.0,4/8/2017,"I ordered a mojito.  It was sour and void of any good qualities of my favorite drink.  I politely asked the waitress to take it off the bill and told her that I would prefer not to order another drink.  Then a few minutes later, the manager came back and started questioning me on the drink .  He said ""I was actually curious if you had ever had one before"" and then ""I watched the staff make it and it was done correctly "". I replied with yes, in fact I have had many, it is my favorite drink and this was BY FAR the worst I had ever had.  He never apologized and was completely rude to me for no reason.  I had been very polite when sending the drink back and didn't deserve the disrespect of this manager.  I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9

There's something for everyone, even vegans (tell them to hold various things and you not gnashing your teeth).  It's more expensive.

Travis D.,"Richmond, VA",187,10,2,5.0,1/28/2016,"I used to despise Applebee's but the food and service here was great! Our server, Lauren, helped us to ""crack"" the menu by offering some of her favorite combinations. The sweet potato fries with the maple blondie sauce is amazing! Food was fast and everything was tasty. Now, I'm not saying Applebee's is a five star restaurant but I had a really good experience and would actually go again. Good job!  I got the actual blondie and it was burnt but a new one was immediately brought out and the manager checked in with us a few to make sure things were going well. Kudos. No wonder TGI Fridays went out of business. Haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9

aaron e.,"Wimberley, TX",9,42,1,5.0,4/20/2016,"I was in town to give a speech on fiscal responsibility to Bloomington High schoolers. Stopped in for some quesadilla burgers and a Corona-Rita. I pulled the Corona out of the Rita and spilled the whole beer all over my lap only an hour before my speech. The manager was great and comped me another Corona. How cool is that!!!??? Well, my pants weren't drying by the end of the meal and I had to act fast. Our waiter had a brilliant idea to use the hand dryer in the men's room to dry up my pants. Well, it worked, and quickly too. It wasn't perfect (I smelled like warm Mexican beer and burned pubic hair) but the rorschach test between my thighs certainly kept my audience's attention for the entire 45 minutes of my fiscal lecture. Doctor says I'll be unable to reproduce for at least 6 months, but if you're in Bloomington, check out Applebee's Quesadilla Burger, y'all. 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9

I really don't mind going there because I like a good drink. Bit they just rolled out these green bean crispers. Those were really good. So good that I slammed down the plate.... I thought about the Asian salad. It looked quite good. They have some fairly attractive meaty options...and frankly, its quite average pricing.  Go ahead and give it a try. I wouldn't argue.

C B.,"New York, NY",125,780,485,4.0,8/31/2012,"Applebee's is another one of those places people love to hate because it's a big chain and it's obviously not fine dining. But it's okay Applebee's, I love you! Favorites:  - Artichoke spinach dip (huge dish, definitely for sharing, with freshly fried tortilla chips) - Orange chicken bowl (though I'm a little scared to eat it now that I know the calorie count - The Weight Watchers menu! Applebee's is remarkably diet-friendly with a variety of options that are low cal, low fat, or meet other dietary restrictions. And the food is actually good, except maybe the veggies which can be a bit dry and flavorless. I like to get steak skewers and onion soup. Mmmm. The only issues I've ever had at an Applebee's came with a surprise ending. We came in here for lunch, and sat there for FIFTY-FIVE minutes, constantly being told the food ""will be out soon"". Finally at the 55 minute mark we got one appetizer. We told them we'd just eat that and then go, because my husband needed to get back to work asap. They apologized profusely, and then, for some reason, brought another one of the same appetizer out haha. I have no idea what was going on in the kitchen, but they then offer to box up the other appetizer, as well as the rest of our meal, and send it home with us, COMPING THE ENTIRE CHECK. So we got our entire meal to go, for free, plus an additional free appetizer, and of course the free drinks we'd enjoyed.  Now THAT is customer service. We could've/would've left very angry, especially since my husband had to get back to work (and the restaurant wasn't busy), but instead we left with huge amounts of free food, and apologies from several people. We were very impressed, and have gone to Applebee's more often since. Just goes to show that great service really can make up for nearly anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bloomington-9
