Robbie G.,"Cartersville, GA",41,367,99,3.0,11/22/2017,Applebees what more can you say.. the ever changing menu that seems to get worse every time.  The food is ok typical apps burgers and other bar foods. The price is ok we went with the 2 apps for 9.99 Must try the chicken taco wonton app really  good. Good drinks and beer deals and burgers not a bad place and this location is always pretty good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Lady J.,"Kennesaw, GA",2,14,1,5.0,11/13/2017,"If you eat here ask for CHELSEY! (wears glasses) She's the best server EVER. Hubby and I ate here 2 weekends ago and she was our server. She was outgoing, gave us suggestions on drinks and food (which we ordered) and brought us things we usually have to ask for (napkins, refills, our check)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Carla S.,"Glendale, AZ",16,32,28,5.0,8/7/2017,I came in only for a Blonde.  Was wonderful as usual.  Moved her from AZ service was good along with my Blonde.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Andrenis C.,"Duluth, GA",18,17,4,1.0,5/1/2017,"I visited this place Saturday, April 29th.  Big mistake, the place was not crowded and we waited 45 minutes for our food.  When they broght the food to the table it was not at all pleasing to the eye,  the macaroni and cheese was cold and pieces of cheese just layed on top of cold macaroni, the steak was so chewy i couldn't eat it and the baked potato had no butter or anything you would want or expect to  see.  I will not be going back to this place,  i will say that when the manager came to the table he was very helpful and I did notice other people were not happy either.  Get better cooks in the kitchen who will care about what they put out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Joe D.,"Beaverton, OR",17,107,442,3.0,12/3/2015,"Applebee's isn't where you go unless it's late. Not bad food, but not a destination. Everything is always the same. Service varies, but the corporate standards are in them all. Usually edible food. Cheap happy hour. Wings are ok. My bistro burger was actually pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Nicole W.,"Cartersville, GA",26,5,,2.0,8/1/2016,"The food usually taste pretty good but that's as far as it goes. I've gone with my mom and husband and with my two closest friends and was disappointed. Getting the food, even the appetizers took an hour and the waitresses size you up and if they don't think that you will leave a big tip they put you on the back burner and don't check on you. She even argued with my girlfriend because they have a special that if they don't offer you a frozen jack and coke that you get a free frozen coke. Well at the end of our visit she told her and the waitress just argued with us that we were all lying even though the only drink she's talked about was ""what you want to drink"" and that was it. Never going back to any Applebee's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Allie O.,"Cleveland, TN",97,3,,1.0,5/30/2016,"While the service was adequate the food was terrible. First the appetizer, which they gave us a credit for, was undercooked inside and overcooked outside, not edible. Then the children's food was a series of compromises as many of the sides were not in stock. Our children all complained and refused to eat, a problem we do not typically experience. The pasta entree had a terrible bitter taste that was overpowering and had to be forced eaten. The fiesta lime chicken was smaller than normal and came without typical lime and pico that I had to request and arrived after I was half way through my food. What a waste of a gift card our local applebees is much better. The only reason I didn't complain further was I had already voiced opinion on the appetizer and simply wanted to get out and hope what we ate settled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Dana S.,"Ranger, GA",25,70,58,5.0,6/26/2015,Great place to stop in for a quick bite. Sam is behind the bar and she gives great service. She found out we were new to the area and offered great shopping and entertainment suggestions the food was also good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Tatyana B.,"Woodstock, OH",0,5,2,1.0,1/28/2016,"Terrible! Stay away! I just ate a piece of ""boneless chicken wings"". Tasted an ""interested texture"" and decided to cut another piece. It was completely raw! I'm not coming back. Service is ok though",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Andrew K.,"Cartersville, GA",0,18,,2.0,11/7/2016,Used to go here every Friday night for half priced apps. Stopped going because every time the food got worse. It was cold or has greasy. Go every couple weeks now since it's cheap and open late and the same issues. The food just isn't what it used to be. The service with our normal waitress is always great but the food keeps me away. They changed up there whole appetizer menu a few years back and screwed if all up. If they would go back to the basic it probably would improve because there would be less dishes to make and more consistency.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Conrad R.,"Cartersville, GA",5,8,,2.0,7/7/2016,Went for early dinner  The waitress was bad. She spent more time talking to someone at the bar than taking care of her tables. After waiting for about 35 minutes we finally got our food. It was overcooked and my onion rings were burnt.  My wife's french fries arrived ten minutes after her order. Actually they were the best part of the meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Kina C.,"Germantown, MD",0,3,,1.0,6/30/2016,"We visited this location on a Thursday night around 7:30, so it wasn't crowded.  We were a party of 17, sitting at different tables.  After an hour, half our party had NOT even ordered.  The hungry ones happened to be a boys basketball team who just played a game!  The manager finally got involved and apologized and said they would rush out the food.  The food came 30 minutes later.  Was this a rush??  There was no free appetizer to hold us over and no compensation on the bill.  Just apologies and stating they are focusing on getting people fed.  WHAT???  Then it took another half hour for them to process the bill.  Stay Away!  Poor Management and poor service. I complained to Applebee's corporate.  We'll see how responsive they are.... food was good, thus the single star",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Sarah W.,"Cartersville, GA",0,13,,2.0,2/18/2014,"If you eat in the food is ok. Service is slow.  NEVER order carry-out.  I ordered something that was described as 'roasted potatoes in herbs' what I got were half boiled potatoes lightly sprinkled with a little pinch of herbs. The salmon wasn't cooked thoroughly, both myself and the cat were sick as hell for two days!  My husbands meal consisted of shrimp that had been sat, dried out and possibly reheated. My mother-in-Laws was dried pasta that looked as if it was a previous order that hadn't been collected and just sat there the rest of the day. My father-in-laws burger was fine, the fries were dry and at the point of chewy.  All in all I won't be going here again. We ordered $60 of food and it wasn't worth a dime of it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Police Lives Matter ..,"Greenville, SC",0,187,17,1.0,1/12/2015,"I can't believe how the food quality at Applebee's has taken a noise dive. Tonight we ordered shrimp & broccoli cavatappi and salmon. There were seven small shrimp in tastless pasta and broccoli. The salmon tastes like cardboard. After we ate, we left and went to another restaurant. First time ever doing this and LAST time eating at Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Lane B.,"Cartersville, GA",3,4,,5.0,12/26/2014,Great night time eatery. A friend and I regularly attend weekly for half price appetizers at 10pm. Danielle knows our order and drinks every time. Food is always delicious and timely. 5 stars!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Kyle W.,"White, GA",7,3,,2.0,5/8/2015,"Not quite the atmosphere I was expecting after midnight at the bar. Mediocre at its best. Slow to respond, and I was at the bar which is suppose to be quick! Only thing going is decent prices on bottled beer. Food quality on other occasions is also sub-par... I'd rather go to IHOP",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
Joshua R.,"Atlanta, GA",110,96,36,2.0,7/26/2011,"Oohhhh Abblebee's, how are you still open?  During a recent lunch at this location I was initially impressed with the service - we were seated right away and our waitress poured on the southern charm. Our drinks came out quickly and our order was placed within about 5 minutes of walking in the door - not bad for a busy lunch crowd. It quickly went downhill from there....  Shortly after getting our drinks we requested to move tables due to a big leak in the ceiling (really, no one working in that restaurant noticed the leak before making us sit under it???). The staff accommodated us, but moving everything over (including a baby) is a bit annoying.  And the worst was yet to come - the food... which is why I asked the question; ""How are you still open?"" We all ordered different things ranging from a chicken salad to a quesadilla burger. I personally ordered from the ""lunch combo"" menu, and almost all of it was pretty gross. The quesadilla burger wasn't bad, but everything else we ordered was tasteless and borderline disgusting. My days of going to Applebee's are officially over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-cartersville-3
