Keara D.,"Chandler, AZ",7,2,2,5.0,11/18/2017,"The Burnin' Love with mushrooms added is my absolute favorite burger and the Oreo shake is delish! Our server was kind and attentive to our large group of friends and kiddos. The acoustics in the restaurant were great. We could have a conversation with one another without yelling across the table. (It was the area right behind the host/hostess stand, on the left with booths and chairs.) We did have a wait after making a reservation, but it wasn't too bad and we used the time to start talking with one another.  There are two things I would suggest improvements on: (1) The baby changing table in the women's restroom was not clean. I started carrying Clorox wipes around and cleaned it off; there was quite a bit of yuck picked up... (2) The text notification reminder didn't work properly. I received 3 texts with 3 different times, none of which were correct. I called in though and they confirmed the correct time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Char C.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",0,12,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Ok at best. Long wait, mediocre service and the food is marginal. The advertise endless fries, but on give you about 5 fries at a time, maybe they mean endless wait for cold fries... Also, don't play the video games at the table unless you want a charge of $1.99 for the same games that you can download  on your phone for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Cait S.,"Winfield, PA",258,26,,1.0,8/12/2017,I have come here a few times and lately it's just been terrible service with miserable servers. The food isn't that great either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Andy M.,"Anne Arundel County, MD",73,58,2,3.0,6/8/2017,"VERY VERY slow service. The waitress who was very polite was what I call a ""disappearer"". She will take your order, bring your drinks bank, and then vanish. 20, 30 minutes go by and you stare into your empty glasses wondering if she put your order in or went home. But other than that, the food was great as Red Robin always is and the location is perfect. I would give them another try, everyone is entitled to a rough night once in awhile",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Jill G.,"Delhi, Cincinnati, OH",0,2,,1.0,10/11/2016,"I love this restaurant, the service at this location leaves something to be desired.  I walk in, make eye contact with the manager and five different servers - all of whom walk in different directions away from the hostess station.  5 minutes later after standing around the manager comes up and makes a half-hearted response but not an apology.  I could see if they were slammed but the place was just nearly empty at 8pm on at Tuesday evening.   I ended up sitting at the bar and bartender gave good service... finally.  I won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, VA",211,594,214,4.0,8/23/2015,It is hard to believe I had never been to a Red Robin before 8/21/15. I had lunch. I was surprised and happy that Red Robin has a good amount of vegetarian options. I had a veggie burger. It was good not exceptional. However Red Robin ' s dining experience was fun and comfortable. Although I had to eat at the bar (because when we arrived all the tables were taken) I never felt ignored. To the credit of our bartender/server she was good at multi tasking.  In a nutshell I am fan of this chain and I wish one was located closer o home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Jacob S.,"Selinsgrove, PA",0,7,,3.0,5/2/2017,"Been here a bunch. Usually good. We came here late after my son's baseball game. So 8ish. Service was good. However our food came out lukewarm. Antonio, the manager, offered to discount the lukewarm burgers. Very nice and appreciated as the good WAS good, just not warm. Regardless, they have a great employee in Antonio, the waitress was sweet and understood where we were coming from. We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
John G.,"Camp Hill, PA",80,246,109,3.0,5/30/2016,Red Robin is Red Robin! Better than fast food burgers but there are better burgers out there if you know where to get them! Mine was prepared well just like I asked! It was the Prime Burger and had Mushrooms Onion straws and an Onion Ring and a BBQ sauce! Of Course it came with AYCE Fries! I find the AYCE fries a real nuisance because the give you between 10-13 1/2 Fr. Fries on your first serving so you have to order more because it's not enough to fill a child over 10!  So minus a star for that 3 stars because most fast food joints can barely make 1! I don't consider Red Robin a Fast Food place but the servers kind of give you the feeling like your in one in their minds maybe you are! So another star deduction! But like I said it beats the FF places! So When Burger Hungry Red Robin is a step up so I will return!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Amanda C.,"Northumberland, PA",1,10,31,2.0,2/6/2016,"Food was great, until I found a long hair ingrained in the melted cheese of my burger. Manager brought another one out for me very quickly, but then my friend found a similar hair stuck in the cheese of his burger, too. Whatever's going on in the kitchen needs to be addressed quickly. Scanning the kitchen, I can identify a few hairy culprits, I mean cooks, with long beards/goatees. At least they're wearing hats, but where's their hair nets? Service was good table side, and the waitress was attentive to our needs, although she did forget to bring campfire sauce as requested with our fries. She and the manager are the only reasons I'm giving this review two stars...one for each of them. Last time I was here (about 3 months ago), I had an issue with my burger (wrong cheese), and the manager addressed my concerns quickly, even though I didn't want to make a big deal about it-I just wanted the cooks to know that the out the wrong cheese on it.  Not sure if I'll be visiting this restaurant for awhile, it's quite a hairy situation we had tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Julie S.,"Millersburg, PA",9,29,,5.0,8/16/2016,"Love the fast, personable, and friendly service. The food is always made as requested and quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Samantha B.,"Sunbury, PA",16,4,,3.0,8/12/2016,"Hostess was a bit rude, very unfriendly. We stood there for a full minute before she stopped talking to her friend and addressed us. Waitress was decent but not great. Only asked if we wanted more fries as we finished our burgers. The fries...well they are good but they give you like 10 at a time so we didn't like that. Towards the end she was pretty much downright rude. We like the food but it seems every time we go there is an issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Savannah F.,"Hughesville, PA",90,17,12,5.0,9/17/2015,"I love red robin. My husband and I go there quite often and we've always had great service and great food! I am gluten free so it's nice to have options that other places don't offer. One time only did we go in and get seated and a waiter never came. We had waited just a few minutes and I went up to tell the host, not in a horrible way- just to see what was happening. There was apparently a mix up to who had the table. The manager immediately came to our table apologizing for the mix up. He gave us a free appetizer and sodas. He served us our appetizer himself and told us if we had anything else to ask about to call him back over. As a frequent customer I was more than pleased by the service of a tiny mix up! You don't find that everywhere! Love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Drew D.,"Brookside, NJ",0,1,,3.0,6/23/2015,Food is pretty good. Only downside is that they bring your appetizers and entrees out at basically the same time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Cody B.,"Cocolamus, PA",1,21,,5.0,1/15/2015,I love Red Robin and this is by far my favorite one to go to. It's close to home and the service has always been good every time I've been there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Steve W.,"Milton, PA",0,1,,2.0,7/18/2014,The food is edible.   The burgers are nothing special.  Gourmet is a hevily abused word.  Maybe they should try rebranding the franchise.  Bonus star for the bottomless fries.  Taking back that shiny bonus star after finding out their eployees do not receive breaks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Andrew S.,"Wildwood, NJ",0,20,,3.0,6/28/2014,"I found out that they give a free burger the month of your birthday. However, you must register as a member for 24 hours b4 getting it. Stupid but i love the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Randy O.,"New Haven, CT",1,1,,1.0,11/29/2014,The worst customers service and don't let me get started about the waiters my food was under cook and to send me order twice no silver wear no napkin jut horrible never again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Stacey C.,"Watsontown, PA",83,55,,4.0,3/1/2014,"It seems that their burgers don't hold the appeal they once did or my taste buds are changing. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, I just wasn't wowed!  Waitress was on top of things and made sure to check back on us. Just wish Janel hadn't stopped by when my mouth was full of food, but it seems that you can't avoid that. I think if there was a Five Guys around here, Red Robin would be in a bit of trouble, or maybe other burger places have ruined RR for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove
Tracy C.,"Northumberland, PA",18,6,,5.0,10/7/2014,"I love Red Robin. I love their fish and chips. Everybody I've met there ; so far, has been very nice. I'm here today for my free burger today for my birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove

ken m.,"Alhambra, CA",4,47,6,5.0,8/11/2010,"This is right by the Best Buy. The Food was great, Red Robin was the best place in town from the places I had tried here. The Burgers were cooked perfectly to order. The price was about 10 bucks for a great burger and unlimited steak fries. I recommend the Red Robin Royal Burger which has a fried egg on top. For those who think this is a bit scary, they have regular burgers as well.  The service was fast and correct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selinsgrove?start=20

Thuy N.,"Philadelphia, PA",111,33,8,4.0,6/29/2011,"Never been to a Red Robins before...burgers were mediocre. Asked for a lil pink but got rare. But I gave 4 stars to our server Steven.

Nathan W.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,41,,4.0,1/25/2012,This Red Robin is definitely a lot better than some of the other locations. This location normally is quick to serve the food.
