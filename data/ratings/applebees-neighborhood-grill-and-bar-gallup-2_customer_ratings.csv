33,Bob H.,"Palm Springs, CA",25,80,165.0,2.0,2013-11-29,So disappointed in tequila chicken and shrimp choice. The size of the shrimp in the menu photo was 16-20 but served was 21-26 (number is count per pound). Totally false advertising on menu. Entree was 9.95. I know why. Would have paid $12.95 if shrimp were as advertised.  Chicken was dry and over charred.  Service was great at start and horrible at end. Good came promptly but then I was a forgotten table. Too busy with side work.  Complained to manager about food. Was told it was what corporate provided.  Plenty of TV viewing so food for sports watching.

Living on the reservation, there was absolutely nowhere to go and nothing to do. When we wanted a drink and some appetizers after a long day of work, my good friend and I would drive the hour to this Applebee's. Previously, when living in a big city, I hated Applebee's. I thought it was overpriced and overrated and generally a restaurant to avoid. When in a town of 5,000, on the other hand, I LOVED this Applebee's. The service is hit or miss, and the food is hit or miss, but those drinks were always on point.

25,Rick S.,"Mahomet, IL",80,122,27.0,1.0,2015-02-08,"As a chain, Applebee's is similar to other middle of the road restaurants (e.g. Chili's, TGI Fridays, Ruby Tuesday's, etc.) that seek to offer a little nicer experience than say, Denny's, IHOP or your basic diner type establishments. For travelers it is supposed to offer an experience that, while may not achieve a very high level of cuisine, will at least provide a decent meal at a reasonable price. I've eaten at several Applebee's across the country, in New Mexico as well as Washington State, Idaho, Oregon, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  The Gallup Applebee's has to be by far the worst restaurant of the group. I have been disappointed here several times but was urged by a friend to try it one more time after a recent remodel of the building. The restaurant's physical plant is much improved after the changes but they would have been better off spending more time on food prep and service training.  I realize that there is limited ability to alter recipes that are supposed to be the same between restaurants across the chain, so the chef may not be able to do much with seasoning and preventing bland food from coming out of the kitchen. However, they can ensure at least that the food comes out hot (or cold as the case may be), and that it isn't burnt. As for service, it seems they need to better train their staff on how not to annoy customers. Our meal was constantly interrupted including a spiel on donating to a charity. At first I thought they were trying to be attentive but it ended up becoming irritating to the extreme. The Hilton Garden Inn next door has a much nicer restaurant and also has a full bar to boot. If you want to grab a drink or casual meal, the Garden Grille is a far better choice albeit more pricey than Applebee's. There are also many other local restaurants such as Virgie's on the west side that offer dinner and drinks at a reasonable price.

This restaurant truly deserves no stars.  My family and I were traveling from Vegas to home and stopped in Gallup for the night. We stayed at the  Hampton Inn right up the street (so location wise, Applebees is in just the right spot). We didn't expect much. Just the New Mexico version of what we have back in New York. Um, no. First off the hostess was just weird. She was on a cell phone when we went in, and didn't hang up when she saw us. Instead she turned her back to us to continue her little chat in private. When she was finished, she told us a table has just opened up and she was having it wiped off. We got to the table and it was still a mess. I get it though. I work in a restaurant and things don't go the way I want sometimes.  Our waitress took our order. Things were looking up. Then a table of about 7-8 came in. We overheard the other waitresses laughing and they told our waitress ""they're allllll yours."" She sighed in sadness. Nice. After that, we weren't really sure who our waitress was. We never saw our original one until she brought the check. The manager on duty kept asking other workers if we had been checked on in a while, so that was nice. I get that she was busy, so the other waitresses stepped in to help, but it seemed every time we needed something, it was accompanied with an eye roll. Sorry, but we're not the reason our waitress is busy. We're not trying to hog your time. We know you have your own tables.  Eh, you win some, you lose some.

I ended up getting food and hanging out at the bar. The bartender, Celena, was professional, fun to talk to, and very attentive to all her customers. The food was up and out fast.

I've been here maybe 5 times since, and the improvement continues. They are consistently doing great.  Our last 2x here we've received truly excellent service with a genuine smile from a lady named Sarah, and she is so aware - and *fast*. Such a rarity it seems nowadays to have such warmth with such efficiency. To be fair, we've been lucky to have some really great servers here, however, in the past they were bogged down by incredibly slow times getting to the table (maybe staffing has been replenished) and the food and sometimes even the drinks weren't brought over promptly. Put it this way: some ppl's butts were numb from sitting before the buzz of their drinks hit their heads. So kudos again to management for supporting this location, and to the managers that used to make the rounds (none this time, maybe because they don't need to, with Sarah on deck?) because things continue to improve and former customers are taking notice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gallup-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

26,Teresa A.,"Sedona, AZ",0,3,,5.0,2017-05-16,"Let me start by saying I am celiac and finding a gluten free meal in Gallup is no easy task. I went to Applebee's hoping to find something that would be safe to eat.  They do have gluten free items on the menu - but I had a few questions regarding the ingredients.  That's when Gerald Harper, the General Manager, came to my table.  I asked him why the cedar grilled lemon chicken was not gluten free - because I wanted something a little lighter than the other gluten free items.  He told me it was the sauce.   So he took the extra time and effort to work with the kitchen to prepare a gluten free sauce.  He said 'no problem at all - happy to do it'.   Granted the restaurant wasn't overly busy at the time - and I probably would not have asked if it was.  But I really appreciated the extra effort and will definitely will go back to Applebee's on my next visit.  The dish was excellent!  Thanks Gerald!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gallup-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

Nope!  The bartender was too busy trying to poach tables in the bar from some server who wanted to go home early.  Then, she got caught by the manager - which led to even more drama.   And, finally, let's not forget the apparently off duty employee who was distracting everyone.  Please, don't let these things get in the way of greeting the ONLY guest at the bar for five minutes. I ordered a couple appetizers - boneless wings were lukewarm and typically bland Applebees fare.  But, I wasn't surprised, short attention span bartender was screwing around, and somebody brought the food.  Then, she couldn't even remember where it went (Hello - I am the only one at the bar).  My second appetizer was much fresher.   Somewhere along the lines, silly bartender was replaced by a solid amateur.  Service picked up from non-existent to slow.  What few guests in there were loud, vulgar, and obnoxious.  The manager should probably spend less time starting flak with bartenders, and regulate their obnoxiously overserved guests instead.   Look, it's a chain - it was safe - I am not sick, I knew what I was getting.  Unfortunately, I got about what I expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gallup-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
16,B R.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,37,7.0,4.0,2017-11-15,"I have been to Applebees a handful of times over the last 20 years, all in different locations. They have been on my 'ok' list, till this week. Hubby and I are living in Gallup for 3 months while we are on a voluntary work assignment. We eat out each weekend and have tried many of the places in Gallup. Applebees was the latest. First of all, it was busy on Veterans day and it seems (but we didn't ask) that there was a special deal going on for Vets that night. Good for them. Hubby and I decided to go for the 2/25 deal. Main entree, sides. I think our server was fairly new, our unfamiliar with the food so I will give him slack for trying but giving wrong answers. I asked if the mashed potatoes had cream (which is deadly to me) and he said no. I clarified, any dairy? He said no, but they did have a gluten free menu if I wanted it....Ok. He is young and doesn't have dietary issues, yet.  I ordered the baked potato to be safe. For the other side, I asked what the grilled veggies were and he said peppers and cucumbers. Cucumbers? yes. Cucumbers. Hmmmm. I am thinking it was Zucchini, but maybe it really was cucumbers. I got green beans. Ok. On to the ribs. I am a TGIF ribs fan. I like the sweet sightly spicy sauce and not the hickory, tomatoey, sauces. I was assured it was the sweet, so I decided to give it a try. The house salad was wonderful! Nothing really spectacular, but we have been salad deprived. Green beans were flavorless, and possibly a little beyond their prime. Potato was safe. The ribs were WONDERFUL. the 1/2 rack was much less than I expected but there was plenty of food. Hubby had the bourbon chicken and shrimp which he liked. Nice dinner. We will return and maybe I will get a full rack of ribs.  Service was fine, they were busy. I do wish there had been wipes or extra napkins.
