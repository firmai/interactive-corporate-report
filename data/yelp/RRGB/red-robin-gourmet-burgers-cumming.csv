Jeremy F.,"Marietta, GA",3,61,75,4.0,11/30/2017,"Red Robin is definitely ""Yummm"".  There aren't too many locations near Atlanta, so this was a treat to find one on our way to hike in North Georgia.  The menu is a little daunting. They offer just about everything you can imagine. But this place is known for their burgers and bottomless fries, so just focus there and ignore everything else.  I got the Royal Red Robin, which had an over-easy egg on top...the kind of egg that when you bite down, the yolk oozes out and down the burger. Yeah, it's pretty incredible.  Drinks are SUPER EXPENSIVE. Holy cow, $2.99 for a soft drink is kind of ridiculous!!  Get water and save some change.  Service here was great.  Everyone from the host to our server was very nice and helpful.  To top it off, it was my birthday, so my burger was free. You have to sign up for their rewards program to get it, but it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming
Karen N.,"Atlanta, GA",3,22,50,2.0,9/6/2017,"I used to regularly frequent this restaurant because I love the burgers and the concept of bottomless sides. But the last two visits have been thoroughly disappointing. At one of my visits my broccoli side had some sort of white web inside. I should have taken a picture of it at the time, but I was too alarmed. I called the waitress over, and she took it to the manager. He came over and told me that the broccoli was SUPPOSED to have black ends and that he didn't see any bug or white web. I eat a lot of vegetables (I know you're thinking who in the world would order bottomless broccoli), and I previously would order the broccoli here and I am sure it is not supposed to turn black or have a white-webbed creature in its midst. They gave me a coupon for a free appetizer for my next visit. I waited a few months before coming again because it was hard to get over the image of the browning broccoli and cocooned critter. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe they just ran out of fresh broccoli that day. Their burgers are normally pretty fabulous, so I wanted to try them again. I ordered the pretzel bites (with the free coupon), and they were not anything special. The cheese dip it came with was unimpressive. I ordered the Banzai (one of my favorites) with the onion roll bun. The flavoring in the burger itself was wonderful as always, but the bun wasn't cooked long enough so I was disappointed. And of course I made the tragic mistake of ordering bottomless broccoli again. It was browning at the tops and ends again (although thankfully I did not discover any white webs). I told the waitress the broccoli was old and asked for fries instead. I have resigned to the fact that they will disappoint. For such a well-known franchise, I think they should take better care to uphold a better quality of food so as not to embarrass the rest of the chain. If you're looking to eat some tasty burgers and binge on steak fries then this may still be a good restaurant for you. But if you are interested in being certain this is a clean restaurant with fresh produce then you may want to reconsider.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming
Kevin G.,"Cumming, GA",40,59,33,4.0,8/26/2017,"Great burger cooked just right, wife had chili bowl and enjoyed it. She said it was a little hot for her but good otherwise.

We got the special which is one of 3 burgers with bottomless fries for 6.99. It's not a bad deal but the hamburger is just slightly better than McDonalds.

Andrea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",531,1117,3672,3.0,6/12/2017,"Their burger was pretty good, but nothing super wowing in any aspects. The gals at the front and bar were super friendly so I presume service is pretty on point.  I went in for a to-go order bc I had a birthday coupon so use. Psst. Sign up for their rewards program, and you can get a free burger. Yes, a whole free burger.  Anyway, I ordered the wedgie burger. It was sort of messy to eat bc lettuce replaced the reg old buns. The guacamole just seemed to spill from all sides of this thing. The burger's seasoning was pretty flavorful and good.

While visiting in Georgia this week our Grandchildren insisted on Red Robin for dinner.  I dreaded it but.... Wow was I surprised.  There were 8 of us and our waitress handled us efficiently.  Our food was delivered without incident and quickly.  Even the spills were cleaned up quickly.  Our main server was  Gabby.

I look at them on the menu and think ignorance would be better. That way you don't see you are going to end up with a full days calories in one meal.  Thank you bottomless fries and no self control. Here I am in Atlanta and the air is blowing at me and it is cold. They tell me Colorado controls the air. That's one long arm.  The food. It's alright judging by the bar clients, beer and bottomless fries are a big draw. I ain't skinny, but I can say that I am dwarfed by a significant number of people you don't want to sit next to on the plane.  Hmm. Got a free burger on the wife's rewards.

It was not very busy but the service was slow as the bartender was also waiting tables. The food was par for a chain burger place. It's hard to complain about a ""free"" burger but the bun looked like it had been smooshed. Go figure.  But to RR's credit, their bottomless fries are really good. They are steak-fry style, crisp outside and light golden brown with great potato flavor. But I had to send back the first batch - luke warm.

The 2nd experience was VERY poor. Waitress had an attitude from the start. Unprofessional, talking over me while I was giving my order, being very short, rolling her eyes at us, etc. Told the manager and he was great. Then the food came out AND GUESS WHAT........... IT WAS COLD!  I immediately spoke to the manager and he was great. He comp'd our entire meal and apologized profusely. He even had the food cooked again.  But the server was terrible.

David K.,"Atlanta, GA",196,116,95,3.0,3/7/2017,"Burgers are consistently average--not bad not great. The signature endless basket of fries is always one of the main reasons to come. The onion rings are tasty, nice batter and crunch. The batter can slip off sometimes though. The fried pickles are always scrumptious. The wings are actually well done! I didn't like the sauce, but it has a nice thin crisp layer and a tender juicy inside, it is surprisingly well cooked.  The atmosphere and décor makes it a fun place for family to come to. Red Robin for some reason is just one of those places we find ourselves craving every now and then. Whatever they're doing, it certainly works. It must be the endless fries--genius.

Courtney T.,"Smyrna, GA",1,28,37,2.0,3/25/2017,"As there are few Red Robins around Atlanta, I was excited to visit when we ended up at a soccer game near this location. We had a very sweet waitor but he was not on his game, or just sucked. From ordering 3 drinks (all waters) and shakes and not getting that right I should have known it wasn't going to be good. Only the chicken fingers came out right. Without sauce, but right.  I am not sure why waiters love trying to remember things, but writing things down does not make you any less of a waiter. In fact, in my book, it only makes you better. I appreciate you taking the time to make sure what you bring me is what I ordered. Repeat it back to me to verify? Even better! But once you get past our server, the food was not worth the money. I try to separate the service and food since one can just be a bad egg, but not in this case. The kids burger was gross, the other food was just ok. The milkshakes were good but not the best. I'd prob choose chickfila over RR, but I am a chickfila addict so that may just be me. I love fry seasoning so that's a plus. Overall left with a bad taste in my mouth. Will not be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=20

First impression, we were greeted at the door immediately. I guess the hostess could tell it was our first time here so she went out of her way to explain everything and cater to us. She gave recommendations and my party of 7 did not hold back on the orders and drink refills! My mother is 71, and slightly a pain in the butt? So when orders were placed on the table and hers didn't come out on the first round she complained out loud to herself. Lol! The waitress heard her apparently and came back with her order and apologizes to is with free appetizer coupons. The hostess and waitress repeatedly came back to see if everything was alright.

Craig B.,"Cumming, GA",0,20,3,1.0,1/30/2016,"Since opening this location has been hit and miss when it comes to service. For the most part the managers treat customers like they are a bother.  The food is mostly consistent, no complaints there. It is THE only reason to go back.  Tonight was no exception to the crummy lack of care shown by the staff, lead by poor management.  The place was unkept. Floors filthy from food on the floor. Pulled out my chair to find it dirty and wet. I tried to make eye contact with the staff. A manager looked at me with what I would describe as disgust and shook his head. I ended up dragging the chair over and exchanging it for a clean on along the wall.  Once seated he came by and rudely said you could not wait?  I responded, shut up. He yelled get out of my restaurant. I refused to go. He went to another manager and was very animated in his conversation. We stayed. The food was fine, but this guy kept standing around tossing dirty looks.  Nice job Red Robin.

Jennie F.,"Cumming, GA",3,42,1,1.0,8/9/2017,"Tried Red Robin again and had an equally disappointing experience. When the waitress seated us with a smile, she asked what I wanted to drink. When I asked for water instead of an alcoholic beverage, I guess our party of two instantly became unappealing to her. From that moment on, her attitude changed, barely giving us the time of day and even trying to rush us. In the middle of placing our order, the waitress stopped me and walked off to have a laugh with another server that was throwing things at her from behind. Later, when she dropped off our meals, she walked off before I could look anything over or asking if we needed anything else--literally dropped the plates and ran. I paged the waitress using the electronic device on the table, but she never returned or acknowledged us until it was time for the bill--I had to ask another passing waiter for the item missing from our meal. My son ordered freckled fruit salad--not a single strawberry in it. Bottomless fries? Nope, not today. My son also wanted a shake to go, so I placed the order through the electronic device at the table. The waitress returned, instructing me to go ahead and pay through the device, once again not asking if we needed anything else or even if we were satisfied. I asked about the shake we ordered and she looked stunned and ran off to get it, quickly returning to try to hurry us from her table again. Unreal experience. On top of this, the table was sticky and the overall cleanliness of restaurant was just plain nasty. When a nine-year-old boy makes a statement that ""McDonalds is cleaner than that place,"" you got a BIG problem. The food was OK, definitely not worth the hype nor the price.

Jay W.,"Cumming, GA",0,21,,1.0,5/22/2015,"I grew up on the west coast, so Red Robin was pretty much part of my life growing up. I have a lot of fond memories there with family and friends across Alaska, Washington and Oregon.  Not surprisingly, I was pretty excited when the Red Robin showed up in Georgia right near our home. One of the only ones here.  Unfortunately, this Red Robin is like seeing your first love from high school after 15 years and they've gotten fat, lost their teeth, and generally lost any semblance of what you loved about them in the first place.  Having been here several times*, my experience has been exactly the same: The service is generally slow and inattentive, the food much below what you would/should expect, and the entire meal is just plain not good.  It's like the corporate HQ forgot they had a restaurant here and so there is little accountability or even desire for the local management to more than the min to get by. It makes me sad to write this review but I have no other choice. Hopefully someone reads this and steps up their game. I hope so, because my family would love to come back. But it's highly doubtful.  *ive been several times for the same reason I've been several times to McDonald's: Because I want it to be good and forget how bad it is until I eat them meal, and realize what a terrible mistake I've made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=20

They have GF for their burgers, entrees and drinks too. Win win! The only reason I gave it a 4* is due to the fact that I paid $11 for a burger and my bun was hard and dry. I understand GF is difficult to work with. But, I shouldn't have received a dry hard bun.  Other than that, the order was perfect, everyone that got the seafood platter, raced about it.

This has great potential- but management needs a burning bush under their ass if they expect this place to survive. Its in a prime location, a good bar, all the makings for a top notch place. If it was mine- It would be a goldmine of service, clean, attentive and listen to your reviews. Let's see what happens on Memorial Day. A special day for mom. IF they ruin it, I'll spill the beans more on reasons we saw NOT to come. If its good- I'll commend mgt for getting their act together...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=40

Madelyn A.,"Alpharetta, GA",1054,2246,10170,2.0,2/15/2015,"Nice casual atmosphere, although a bit noisy.    I liked the decor.  Now, I don't go out to eat burgers because that is just silly to me.  My husband loves to go out and eat burgers frequently so this time I thought that I would give it  a go.  Nothing on the menu interested me and I was not going to order, anything, ( no big deal, I do this often) , but he started to get nervous and said that we would leave so I quickly ordered from the kiddie menu because I knew that he was hungry.  Of course I did not care for the burger.  I prefer a turkey burger, breast meat, topped with tomatoes, onions, avocado, cucumbers, lettuce  and a splash of white balsamic vinegar.  Now, I know that I am only going to get this custom burger by making it myself.  I also know that it will be prepared with clean hands and to my exact specifications.  So this is why I don't frequent burger joints.  I also don't understand why their  burgers are considered gourmet burgers.  They were actually very plain to me.  My husband is a repeat customer, but when I questioned price vs product vs what he typically gets at home, he suddenly lost his appetite and said that he would not be returning to the Robin.   Know BEFORE you go. Update 7/30/15  As of this date, my husband has not returned to the Robin and continues to enjoy his wife's deliciously awesome burgers at home! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=40

My issue is the service which only seems to get worse as time goes by.  Visited this location after watching a movie at the AMC around 9:30 PM on a Saturday.  It took over 45 mins to get our order although there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant.  My son's kid's meal was delivered with fries at room temperature and none of us had silverware at our table.  The staff was more focused on cleaning up before closing for the day.  When the waitress did realize that the silverware was missing she brought some that we couldn't use anyway due to the assortment of stains on the knives.

Richard R.,"Suwanee, GA",2315,1000,11015,3.0,4/15/2012,"Red Robin is probably thee most attractive burger joint anywhere. The decor is outstanding, but I wish the taste of the food matched.  When they first came to town and open their doors off Web Gin House Rd in Snellville, it was amazing. It marked the first time I'd ever had a burger with a fried egg on top. I fell DEEP in love when they introduced endless steak cut garlic fries... but after a little time went by, it seems the food became less and less satisfying.  Got a coupon on Facebook ($5 off) and thought I'd give them a try. After all, it's been a few years. To my delight they had Patty Melts on the menu, but to my disappointment it was not as flavorful as I hoped.  *The Patty Melt was average. If I had a wish list it would be for a better seasoned burger patty, rye bread that tastes like rye (which this bread did not) and fries that aren't visibly dripping with grease. I also prefer grated Parmesan cheese on the fries instead of stringy shaved (like I received today).  *The Clam Chowder was good, but I used to think it was great (back when they first opened). *The fried mushrooms were ok, I would have liked them cooked a tad bit longer, but not bad.  Overall, I love the look of this place, but don't have the same love for the food. It's not a bad restaurant, but for the price of food here, I can think of several places I'd rather go.

Brent H.,"Midlothian, VA",124,163,75,4.0,2/27/2013,"My first time visiting Red Robin in Cumming was a couple of weeks ago.  I don't think I'd ever stepped foot in a Red Robin before but I could be wrong about that, because I tend to confuse this chain with Johnny Rockets. It was Valentine's Day and we had tickets for Die Hard.  Rather than fight other miserable couples for service at a ""nice"" restaurant before the movie, we opted for this place because we figured that a greasy burger joint is not exactly a romantic destination.  We were correct.  However, it does appear to be an after school destination for Forsyth's preteen population. The interior is surprisingly spacious and clean.  There is kitschy stuff strewn about like road signs, odd art and a miniature Statue of Liberty that greets you at the door.  There is also a small arcade area with video games adjacent to the entrance, and more importantly, a full bar.  I wasn't aware that they served alcohol at these places but they'll whip up a boozy shake for you if that's what your heart desires. Our server was very attentive.  That's important because they served my Diet Coke in the smallest possible glass which was also crammed full of ice.  Just a few sips from that thing and it was drained.  But the server was so on her game that I never went thirsty, even though that meant bringing at least four refills.  She never complained or rolled her eyes once. I ordered a cheeseburger with a fried egg on it, because that is the best way to order a burger.  Instead of asking how I wanted the meat cooked, she asked me if I wanted ""pink or no pink"".  This concerned me a bit but I understand the need to standardize the cooking process at these fast-casual chains.  Fortunately my ""pink"" burger was delivered to the table at a perfect medium.  My preference is medium-rare, but it was honestly very well cooked and flavorful so I can't complain too much.  The egg was also fried to perfection.  It was a damn tasty burger and much better than I had anticipated. Burgers at Red Robin come with bottomless fries.  You can keep ordering fries until your gut bursts.  That's a nice option, but these aren't fries that would make me want to order multiple baskets.  They are massive steak fries covered with a lip-puckering coating of salt.  You can opt for sweet potato fries at a $1.50 upcharge, but frankly they are just as salty and not worth the cost in my opinion.  Stick to the regular fries and limit yourself to one portion for the best experience. Red Robin pleasantly surprised me.  Well cooked burgers, fast and friendly service, and reasonable prices.  Plus booze.  That's a winning combination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=60

I will say that we started with the sweet potato fries & they left a good bit to be desired. We actually had a free voucher for them.  I wouldn't pay for them, based on how they tasted. They were room-temp at best, not too tasty & came with an odd dipping sauce. Our burgers were good as always. I think the steak fries seemed a bit less yummy than they used to be. Not quite as hot, not seasoned at all (they do provide seasoning salt on the table, tho), and didn't seem quite as fresh & soft as they used to.  I sure hope the quality of RR isn't going downhill (based on reviews I've read of this location & the Lawrenceville one).  Boo-hiss if so!  They've always been one of my favorite burger places since I discovered them about 8 years ago.

Not even close. I rarely blast a place in my reviews, but this Red Robin is R-U-F-F rough. We (wife, daughter, & I) went on a Saturday around 4 pm - they were about 1/2 full (1/2 empty?), and we sat immediately. The server clearly did not want to be there, and she treated us like we were distracting her from something. After a VERY mediocre burger & fries basket, we sat at the table for 10-15 minutes, obviously waiting for a check, when the server stopped by & asked if we wanted any more fries. Maybe 20 minutes ago, yes. But now we wanted to leave. I asked for a check, and she told me I had to pay using the wireless tablet at our table. I'm not a fan of identity theft, so I asked if she could run it at the register, which she - politely -  declined to do.

C M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,68,5,2.0,1/17/2016,"I've been here a few times, mostly because my children are big fans of the mac and cheese.  That's where the fandom ends in this family.  The food overall is fairly average and it's very obvious the restaurant has a portion control strategy. The burgers are on the smaller side and the sides are squeezed into tiny side dishes.  What stuck in my craw the most is the $1.99 ""entertainment fee"".  Beware.  There is zero information that there is a charge for the kid friendly electronic device conveniently placed on the table.  The service, at least today was flat out poor. During my meal, the server completely forgot my hummus appetizer and never came by for a drink refill.  I also need to mention that upon arrival the two hostesses showed no effort at being hosts. One had her head down in the seat map and the other had her head in some type of tablet device used by the restaurant.  Terrible introduction.  No greeting, no smile.

Tyler B.,"Flowery Branch, GA",23,8,,5.0,1/27/2012,"Went tonight with my girlfriend to get a bite to eat. Just an appetizer and a dessert. We got the ""Mountain High Mudd Pie"", which is a HUGE amount of ice cream, at least five scoops worth, to my estimation. Not to mention the whipped cream and tasty caramel. Easily worth the $7 Our appetizer, which was also $7, was the ""Cheeseburger Con Queso"", a "" zesty cheese dip with fresh ground beef, topped with salsa and fresh cilantro"". It was VERY disappointing. The dip was bland, and the chips a bit stale. I've had much better queso at other restaurants for half the price. Now, you may be saying ""if the queso is so bad, why are you giving them a five-star review?"" Well, I let our waiter know about the quality of the queso, and the manager came out, apologized, and took it off our check! If that's not great service, I don't know what is.

I have visited this location a few times and each time was progressively worse, and each time I swore not to return. I tried to turn the other cheek in a restaurant kind of way, and give them another chance, but this time, I SWEAR I will not go back! Service was the worst ever. I had my 2.5 kids with me and we hadn't seen the food for thirty minutes, so i asked for fries to hold them over. They never came. The food finally came out and the fries were cold. I asked for fresh fries. They never came.We had no ketchup at the table, I asked for ketchup, or catsup, or anything red. Finally I asked a neighboring table for the coveted tomato sauce. In fairness, when the waitress brought the check she did manage to say ""Oh you wanted ketchup"", so she didn't completely forget, just forgot to bring it while we were eating the cold fries. Food was, and is always average at best. Sandwiches are never as good as they sound on the menu, or look in the pictures. I appreciate the vegetarian options, but they are both commercial, either a MorningStar Farms Veggie Burger or a BOCA Original Vegan Burger. Between the two, I prefer the BOCA. These can be subbed for all their regular burger options. While we were there I saw two different tables ask to speak to the manager, and not to rave about the food or complement the service.

With a bevy of over-eager teen-aged servers. My order of choice was obviously a burger, seeing that it's their specialty. There are quite a few burger choices on the menu but I settled for a cheeseburger since it's easier to compare with other burgers. Burgers here come in two temperatures: ""pink or no pink""; which is their chain speak for your preferred doneness. They also come with bottomless steak fries. The burger was meh. In fact, I wanted to shout, ""where's the beef?"" I could not taste the beef at all with the large amount of toppings. First of all, the beef patty was tiny and the buns were huge and tasteless. Then, it didn't help that it also had a whole handful of shredded lettuce, two huge slices of tomatoes, 2 slices of cheese, 7 onion rounds, 4 big pickle slices, and 3 teaspoons of mayo.  It's like eating a salad sandwich.

Fried jalapeño rings, tangy salsa and spicy Pepper-Jack cheese layered on top of a cayenne-seasoned and served on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo. It certainly sounds like it is going to be a 4 alarm fire in your mouth of taste but it is more like a burning trashcan that you can throw a splash of water on.

George C.,"Newnan, GA",596,519,1,3.0,3/17/2011,"What started out to be an easygoing attempt to have a burger at a different place became complex. Let's get the easy part over with: The 'Banzai Burger' was surprisingly tasty with a slice of pineapple and teriyaki sauce topping a lean beef patty, lettuce, and other goodies. It was served half wrapped in paper to prevent burger juices from anointing one's shirt front. Unfortunately, the protection didn't work, and I got to wear a teri stain on my shirt for the remainder of the evening. The steak fries were large, hot, and soft, which is OK, not a killer thing for me. Things got complex when we were pretty much 'processed' like herd animals to a booth, ""Hi, I'm Kissy (not real name), welcome to Red Robin, what's for drinks, I'll be right back, here y'go, what're your dining choices this evening (zip)."" Now, I don't expect servers to fawn over me and make like my new best friend either, but when all the waitstaff are walking around like racewalkers while the neon lights, noise, and loud colors are vying for attention, dining restfully becomes difficult because there's this frenetic pace to 'sit, order, eat, pay, leave.""

My salad was mixed greens with some cheese, tomatoes and cucumbers. They have a decent dressing selection. I got the Asian sesame which wad good. The husband got some sort of smoke house BBQ with fried onion burger. The report was that it was great. What really stands out at the RR are the onion rings. They are huge and perfect.

Bottomless Fries too but I don't need the carbs.
