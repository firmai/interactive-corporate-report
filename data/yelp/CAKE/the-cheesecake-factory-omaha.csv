Alexandra P.,"Omaha, NE",2,12,8,4.0,8/19/2016,The Original style cheesecake was the main reason I came here. And have to say as a staple cheesecake it was pretty ordinary and not what I was expecting. It was good but not good enough. I found the consistency to be much more thicken than others. My favorite part was the crust of course! Our server Doris was very nice and definitely provided quality customer service and made our dining an enjoyable experience. Will be coming back try other cheesecakes!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Sam B.,"Lincoln, NE",19,33,,5.0,4/12/2017,"For the longest time, I resisted going to the Cheesecake Factory even though my wife had been after me to take her there. I thought it was going to be one of those ""chick places"" that serves soups, salads, small sandwiches, and desserts (emphasis on the latter). I finally gave in and took her there. Boy was I wrong about this place! The food is incredible, reasonably priced, and the portions are definitely man-sized. The service was actually pretty good considering that it was a Saturday evening and the place was packed.  If I had any complaint at all about the Cheesecake Factory, it would be that the business it gets would easily support the opening of another location in Omaha. And while we're at it, let's put one in Lincoln too. You'd never get me out of the place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Rosie A.,"Omaha, NE",6,41,29,1.0,10/15/2016,$11.95 for a chocolate martini that was not good at all...no thank you! Last time for me. I'll stick to ordering their Chipotle chicken pasta on the curve and skip the drinks. It's the only dish I enjoy from there anyway.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Kelly L.,"Omaha, NE",0,2,,2.0,10/8/2017,"We have eaten at Cheesesteak Factory several times and everything is usually good.  Tonight, five people went for my daughter's birthday.  4 of the 5 entrees arrived after a lengthy period, but a burger came at least another 10 minutes after the four other entrees. The burger that was ordered well done came rare.  I had to go seek out the waitress but never found her, so told the hostess.  She said the manager would come over.  Another five minutes passed and still no manager...went back to the hostess to say ""we just want the burger cooked longer, can someone just come pick up the burger ?"".  More time went by before someone came to get the burger. The manager apologized and basically said she would comp the burger.  I told her this really wrecked my daugher's birthday dinner.  She offered free cheesecake.  Ok, we'll take it.   I am not kidding that another 15-20 minutes went by before the burger finally came.  The free cheesecake had to be requested two times before it came.   I don't know what happened tonight, but it was very awfully frustrating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Brandon S.,"Omaha, NE",4,47,,5.0,11/21/2016,"I've never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory. I came here yesterday for my sisters birthday. My favorite dish is the Factory Burrito, but yesterday I had the four cheese pasta with chicken and got a slice of pumpkin cheese cake to go. The food, service, cleanliness and decor has always been great. This is definitely a place I'll keep returning to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Christine H.,"Omaha, NE",68,398,142,3.0,3/8/2016,"This place has gotten way too corporate. There are literally flat screen televisions above their cheesecake counter advertising their food and drink options. Nothing charming about that. In regards to their menu, while I appreciate  variety, their menu is just too large. It is literally 21 pages. Every time I go here I don't have the patience to go through it. Portions are massive which I am sure some people appreciate but it just isn't necessary and just perpetuates the cycle of overeating. The other night I got 2 cocktails and just those drinks were $24...way too high for a restaurant chain.  The food is good and I always enjoy their cheesecakes  but I think they should scale it back a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Kendra D.,"Omaha, NE",47,66,139,4.0,3/15/2016,"Although, I usually like to support small local businesses, I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I love that they've revamped their menu and have a separate ""Skinnylicuous"" menu; an easier way to control your portion sizes, all salads and entrees are under 600 calories. I ordered the Skinnylicuous Grilled Steak Medallions which were excellent! The meal was more than substantial and absolutely delicious! I also ordered the Red Sangria, which is listed at just 150 calories per glass. I love that I was able to eat out with a friend without feeling guilty after. The regular menu is hugely extensive and a little overwhelming. Sticking to the Skinnylicuous menu helped make my decisions much easier.  I noticed on my way in that they have happy hour Monday-Friday 4-6pm, so I will definitely be coming back to check that out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20

Madeline W.,"Omaha, NE",1,10,3,4.0,4/7/2017,"My food was delicious (chicken and biscuits) and I tried the Tex Mex egg rolls for the first time. My usual favorite is the avocado egg roll appetizer which are wonderful for any avocado lover. This restaurant is a place I frequent. I usually don't have any problems, but most recently one of our orders was not entered into the system. He was served late but the manager compensated that meal-- which made everyone happy. I would recommend this place to anyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Mikki D.,"Bonner Springs, KS",124,3,,5.0,3/28/2017,I love this restaurant. The food is always great and the service is good. My favorite dish is the stuffed chicken tortillas and key lime cheesecake.  I really wanted to write in because I ate there again today and it reminded me of the last time there and I watched the manager apologize to a table for like 20 minutes to a table of 12 some people and they were so rude. So I remembered and wanted to say thank you and remember not everyone is as rude as some of these people I'm sure you have to deal with.  Keep up the good work!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20

Meshawn C.,"Bellevue, NE",3,20,4,4.0,9/28/2016,Had the cheesecake factory for the very first time. I will have to say the food is okay.... they give u a lot food but not what I expected as in price.

Ashleigh H.,"Omaha, NE",21,2,,1.0,2/14/2017,"Super disappointed as I've enjoyed eating in here. Tonight decided that we wanted to try the take out. Called for curbside pick up. After 25 minutes called again to see what was taking so long and they couldn't find my order. Girl comes out with ""our order"" which was the wrong order. So we waited 25 more minutes for them to bring out the right order. Offered no discounts or even an apology for that matter. Get home and the food was cold so turns out it was probably ready the whole time and they just forgot about it. It will take a lot to get me to come back and eat here.

Tasha K.,"Blair, NE",3,5,,1.0,2/2/2017,This place is horrible. Everything we ordered was not all that great. Only the cheesecake was good. I ordered the guacamole and it was tasteless. I told the waitress we were done eating it because it was very bland and not very good. She responded with oh ok and took the plate. Didn't ask to have something different or even a refund. And the salmon kale salad was a waste of money also. I think this places problem is the menu. Had way too many options to choose from. The smaller the menu the better quality food. I'll give it one star because the cheesecake is bomb.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20
Jennifer W.,"Parker, CO",0,3,,1.0,8/11/2017,I have been to Cheesecake Factories all over the country and this was by far the worst service. Seating experience wasn't good and it took over an hour to get our food after we ordered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=20

Snow M.,"Omaha, NE",139,213,385,4.0,9/23/2017,"It is the Cheesecake Factory. What more can be said? Huge menus, huge portions, strong drinks. I recommend the pot stickers because of that wonderful sauce. They do have some lighter fare menu options for those watching calories. If you get creative, you can stick to your macros. They even have low carb cheesecake but seriously, if you are going to fall off the wagon let it be face first into a slice of their full fat, full calorie laden, mouth watering cheesecake.

Yogeshree T.,"Seattle, WA",77,98,36,4.0,2/14/2017,"Best part about Cheesecake Factory is the quality they maintain at every location and you can always expect to get what you are craving out of their large menu. We, the business travelers, turned up here for an easy evening dinner. I had the herb roasted Lemony salmon with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus and it was yummy and creamy rich.

John R.,"New Bern, NC",0,12,5,2.0,3/22/2017,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time and we were very disappointed.  We both ordered the Rennet's lunch special (I think that was the name?) she got the turkey sandwich with the default salad and I got the almond chicken salad sandwich with the Caesar Salad and we each had the soup of the day.  My almond chicken salad sandwich tasted like tuna/ranch on buttered toast- not bad tasting, but not even close to what I expected.  Her default salad had very little (watered down?) ranch and neither of us wanted it - it sucked. My Caesar salad was good, except my croutons may have been a little stale.  Our soup of the day - apparently they only have 1 soup that changes each day? Anyways, it was a mushroom based soup that tasted sweet.. some people might be into that, but I hated it (wife thought it was alright). I hate throwing away food, but I couldn't stomach it past 3 spoon fools.  I thought the food was fairly expensive for what we got, let alone the fact the food sucked..  The ONE thing we both really enjoyed was the Cheesecake. The cheese cake lived up to the hype we heard, but even then it wasn't without issue- we got two cheese cakes with Lunch and requested 2 to go. The two brought out to the table were great and large, the two we got to go were already packed up and significantly smaller- not sure if that is their protocol or not, or if certain cheesecakes are larger than others and the two we had dinning in were two of the 'larger' cakes and the two we got to go were 'smaller' cakes. Despite the cheesecake being good, we don't plan on going back, ever.  I'd recommend just going for the cheesecake/desert if you go at all, but this was our only time here, so we obviously can't spell for the other menus items.  One last closing note- we had a good server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha

Although I didn't have any room for dessert, I'd have to come back on empty stomach so I can fill up and try their cheesecakes.

Justin B.,"Bellevue, NE",37,65,12,4.0,12/29/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory a few nights ago with my mother and girlfriend. So here is how this went down. We only had to wait about 15 minutes before the buzzer went off and we were seated. No complaints there. The waiter then took our order and disappeared into the kitchen. About 15 minutes went by and no food came; however the waiter came back twice to let us know it was a busy night and to thank us for being patient. Cool. After another 5 minutes or so the manager came by to appologize and thank us for our patience and let us know our food was on our way. Usually I would have an issue with the length of time it took to get our food; however the manager and his staff were rather engaged with us about it so I did not take issue.  Next, My and my gf's dinner was fine. Mac-n-Cheese burger was absolutely delicious. Properly cooked and fantastic. My gf's Chicken Bellagio was also fantastic. Properly cooked and the noodles were done just right. However, my mother's Mushroom burger was a disaster. The saute'd mushrooms were so crispy you would have thought they were fried. The burger was so over done, you would have thought you were at a military ""burger burn"" fundraiser. She choked through half of it before I told her she needed to bring it to the waiter's attention. Once the waiter came back; she spoke to him about it. He immediately apologized and said that he would go get the manager for us.  Once the manager came, he looked at what was on my mother's plate and said he would get a new one out for her immediately and apologized profusely. The manager was very professional. Now, we are not the type of people that get ""screamy"" and ""yelly"" when things go wrong. Mistakes happen. So goes life. So, the manager asked us what he could do to fix the issue, my mother said she just wanted a properly cooked meal and would leave that decision up to the manager. The manager stated he would get her a properly cooked meal ASAP and he would also comp the meal for the inconvenience. About 8 minutes later, a properly cooked Mushroom burger arrived and it was ""excellent"" according to my mother. Cool. 3 out of 3 great meals. Cool.  Then came dessert. Plain Cheesecake and Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. ""Oh Em Gee"" was it delicious. The Pumpkin Pecan is definitely dangerous. Not overly sweet; but very addictive. Sadly it is ""seasonal"".  So all in all; the food was good, and management did great in correcting a poorly cooked meal. All things said and done; I have no qualms about going back. I can definitely say that if I a mistake happens in the kitchen-I know it will be corrected promptly. Mistakes happen; and the manager knows how to fix them. A definite recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha
Erin F.,"Omaha, NE",51,159,144,1.0,1/29/2017,"Boy oh boy do we need another location in town. We decided to get carry out last night and the Bakery/carry out counter was completely overwhelmed. We were told 30 mins for food, in actuality it was 45 minutes. It would have been longer but we spotted our food being shuffled onto a shelf and ignored, had we not asked about it we would've ended up like the guy before us who was ignored for ten minutes while his food got cold. The carry out window forgot our dessert and had us stand and wait for it as they shuffled through piles of tickets looking to see if we had actually paid for it. When they finally bagged it we were told they were out of napkins and silverware. The other issue is the food quality which has been steadily declining as of late. On our last visit we received burned carbonara and the waitress balked at replacing it, the visit before that I received chicken that was undercooked. Last night the asparagus side was inedible, overcooked, and an off color. They also seem to have changed their once delicious carrot cake to a flavorless slice of mediocrity that is 2/3 the size it was previously.  I recommend visiting a place that values their customers a little more highly to satisfy your sweet tooth at least until they sort out their management and food quality issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha
Melita S.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,20,8,5.0,11/14/2017,the cheesecake is amazing. And we are still trying to make it as good back in Croatia. But I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Ka'ili H.,"Omaha, NE",235,381,194,4.0,9/19/2017,"What can go wrong at the cheesecake factory?  Other than the fact that they discontinued my ultimate favorite cheesecake, the Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake, everything else they make is pretty darn good.  Service is also great, waiters and waitresses come by often to check on you and make sure everything tastes great and waters are filled.  I love coming to their happy hour and enjoying their avocado egg rolls.  The menu is enormous so it's usually hard for me to decide what I want.  What I do love is the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae.  The presentation is gorgeous you almost don't want to eat it.  But once you do it's over!  You've got dollops of ice cream with whipped cream on top, three pieces of warm brownie lined in between the ice cream and godiva chocolates nestled in the whipped cream to top it off!  It's pretty amazing I wish I could be eating one right now!  Other than their amazing desserts they also have great alcoholic drinks and I've always loved their garlic pasta with chicken dish too.  Like I said, what can go wrong here other than taking away an amazing cheesecake?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha

Lianna N.,"Omaha, NE",361,1033,7526,4.0,4/15/2016,"There is definitely a draw to Cheesecake Factory than every American feels. It might be the large dining space, or the expansive menu that has something for all. If not the first 2, well, it's the cheesecake! There are so many flavors it's really hard to go wrong with any of them. My personal favorite is the classic with the strawberries on top or the white chocolate raspberry.  CF suits families, casual diners, first dates/date night, pre-prom, etc. It's all American! This is the only location in Omaha/Lincoln, and I know people from Lincoln who drive to Omaha just to eat here.  Service is always pretty good as they have 1 million servers. The only negative here is that it's such a busy location that sometimes there's a wait to eat if you don't come at a good hour. Overall this is a very popular chain that has done well for many many years. It's a staple at malls across America, and we just can't seem to get enough!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha
Erin N.,"Bennington, NE",44,91,158,2.0,12/8/2016,"Came here a few days ago on a date night with hubby, we dont plan on coming back, except maybe for some cheesecake for carry out.  We walked in and were seated right away but we were sat at a half booth half table that barely fit anything on the table it was so tiny! We were practically touching elbows with the people at the table next to us. I'm talking so close we would get wiffs of their breath. It made me nauseous.  The server came and got our drink order. When she came back with our drinks we ordered the ""fried cheese"" for an appetizer. It took quite a while for our appetizer to come out but we are pretty patient so we brushed it off and placed our dinner order when she brought it out. I was not a fan at all. It was fried mozzarella and asiago (I think?) but it tasted really weird, kind of like a loaded baked potato or something. The cheese could have been melted a bit more too. We sat and talked, waiting for probably a good 30 to 45 minutes for our food to come out. I noticed a chunk of food on our silverware that we hadn't yet used. Hubby said how his silverware felt greasy and his menu was too.  Finally the food came out. I got fish and chips like the last time we came here, but it didn't look very tasty like I had remembered. They also raised the price to $17.99. I tried the fries, they were good. What you would expect. I didn't even try the slaw, just not my thing. Then there's the fish. The star, what I was so excited for. It was bland, and WAY overbattered! I couldn't get a good picture because of the dark lighting but honestly it was like 25% fish and 75% batter. I'm not even kidding. I had to pull off most of the breading to even see or taste fish. The fish was extremely small and thin and over cooked. Some pieces were hard to chew. Tartar sauce was good though.. This meal was not worth the price at all. I felt completely ripped off. Hubby got a burger of some sort that he thought was pretty good, nothing special though. He said they barely put any mushrooms on it and they charged us $2 for a slice of cheese. We were frustrated with the whole situation and just wanted to leave. We waited for a good 10 minutes before our server came and took our food to be boxed up and give us our check. I only ate a few fries and a single torn up piece of fish. Hubby only had about half of his burger. I really wanted to get a slice of cheesecake but I had just witnessed the table next to us wait for 15 or 20 minutes for some, so no thanks. I didn't think about it until writing this review but with so little food eaten on our plates you would think they would ask if we didn't like our food but they didn't. We arent ones to complain and we had things we had to go do. I was so excited to come back but left disappointed. The service was fine but scarce, and the food was extremely unpleasant in my case. I left just as hungry as when I showed up and even went to the gas station on the way to run errands to get a slushie and a snack just to not feel famished! I think it's safe to say we wont be returning or at least to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha

Chad K.,"Gretna, NE",18,450,462,4.0,1/28/2016,"This is a fun place to grab a meal. It can be bit noisy and crowded, but that's just a result of its popularity. They have a huge menu. It's sort of an ongoing punchline actually. It's essentially a book. On the plus side, they have something for just about every taste. That makes this a pretty agreeable place to dine as you can have a half dozen people in your party craving a half dozen different kinds of cuisine and they can all find something to eat here. I tend to stick to either the Shepherds Pie or the Orange Chicken. I'm not sure why. Both are excellent. I've tried one or two other entrées on their menu as well, but I always come back to those two. The Avocado Egg Rolls are pretty tasty too, but incredibly rich.  Prices are a bit more than what it seems most non-regulars are expecting to pay. It's not so much because it's upscale or fine dining (though it is a nice place to dine) but a matter of supply and demand. This place does not hurt for business and so they're priced accordingly. I've heard from a lady that works as a trainer at a Cheesecake Factory in another city that a shockingly large amount of their food is indeed prepared from scratch each day. This is in contrast to most chain restaurants where everything seems to arrive already prepared in plastic bags. I detest the seating. Ask for a booth and pray you get one. If you get a table you will be sitting close enough to other dining parties to literally rub elbows and when their waitperson shows up and stands between the tables to hand out food or drinks you'll have a waitperson butt in your face. At this price point I really shouldn't have to feel like a sardine in a can. Service is usually pretty good.  I've had great service and I've had marginal service, but I've never had terrible service here.

Some of my favorite food is the mushrooms for an appetizer, steak is always prepared well, and the Mac n cheese from this place is amazing.

Christye G.,"Iowa City, IA",233,476,1280,3.0,1/28/2017,"I came here for my birthday. I was blown away with how busy and packed they were for 1 o'clock. I was expecting quiet and not many people. They seated us quickly. I liked how the pager fit in my pocket. The restroom was cute but too small to accommodate that large of a volume of people. I was frustrated and disappointed that they seated people on either side of us, so we had no where to put our coats because we had booth seating on my side of the table and my other friends had the chairs. And being so scrunched together, I felt like my butt was on their table. Luckily the people on either side of us were friendly because privacy was definitely invaded. The food was the bomb. They forgot my friend's salad dressing and it took a while to flag down the waiter. Oh, my! My s'mores cheesecake was delicious (and beautiful)! Our waiter gave us the wrong checks. He didn't seem very organized but then again, none of the staff seemed too enthused to be there. It was nice to visit with my friends but I felt claustrophobic.

Moira R.,"Omaha, NE",87,233,665,2.0,9/24/2015,"Despite preferring local restaurants, there are some chains that I really love. Unfortunately the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do much for me. I usually find myself here once a year or so, and the food is good, but it isn't great, and is a little pricey for what you get. Their cheesecake is very good, though. As a lot of other reviewers mentioned, the menu is huge. It is basically a giant book with any kind of food you could want (burgers, salads, wraps, pizza, Thai food, Mexican food, etc.). On the plus side, you shouldn't have any trouble finding something on the menu that you will like. It is a little overwhelming having to flip through a giant book (with excessive advertisements and photos in the middle) to look over the entire menu, though.  My husband and I went here for dinner on a weeknight. For an appetizer we ordered the Loaded Baked Potato Tots, which were served with ranch. Other than being a little too salty, these were awesome. The flavor was incredible and they were perfect dipped in the ranch.  For my entrée I went with the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad. The salad was huge and loaded with a large variety of toppings. The dressing was (per the name) a basic BBQ sauce and ranch dressing. The salad was good, but nothing amazing. My husband ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which were served on a pretty impressive and large tray, and he was very satisfied with his meal.  Despite the restaurant being over half empty, we were seated at one of those long booth/table combos in which the tables are RIGHT next to each other, and there was a couple at the next table. The tables are so close that we were awkwardly close to the other people (I accidentally knocked them when I was trying to scoot in). I wouldn't have minded if the restaurant was even a little crowded, but it was really weird since it was almost empty (and the next 4 tables were completely empty). That couple left and another couple were sat at the same table (more awkwardness). Our server was friendly, but would disappear for long periods of time. We had to chase her down when we wanted to pay after we had waited 20 minutes for her to come back and she never showed.  I am sure I will end up here again in a year or so, and the food will probably be good, but it isn't someplace at which I would go out of my way to eat. I would totally go out of my way to stop in and get cheesecake from here if I was in the area (and they have a convenient counter at the front that makes it easy to do just that).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha

Alex W.,"Lindsay, NE",5,49,42,4.0,10/6/2015,"First off, I like the cheesecake factory. They have good food, and they have options for every possible picky eater. I mean picky eater to the max! Their menu is a small book, and that isn't an exaggeration. The down fall is it can take a while to decide if you aren't sure what you are in the mood for. You get warm bread while you are waiting, which is nice. You really don't need a whole appetizer its so much food. They have a good sized drink menu, but a bit pricey. Last time I was there my glass of wine was $9. A bit much for half a glass. Their portions are ridiculous. Everything I have ever ordered there comes with enough food to feed at least two people if not three. All servings are doubled if not tripled. I go home with a few meals from the left overs, which I can't complain about to much. The food is good, but honestly, its nothing special. It's average food. The cheesecake is on a whole new level, that's why I gave it 4 stars. I have never had bad cheese cake there. It is so good and there are so many choices! I usually get it to go because I'm so full from the other food! It is quite pricey for a meal, but with the serving sizes so big you do get what you pay for. The cheesecake slices aren't cheap, but oh so worth it! This isn't a place I go often at all, but when I do I splurge on the cheesecake. If you are looking for a place with a menu of choices for everyone, this is the place to go.

Lance F.,"Omaha, NE",171,327,214,2.0,8/24/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory, the place we usually go after dinner somewhere else to get a wonderful slice of cheesecake.  Never had I actually eaten a meal at a Cheesecake Factory until recently, when my son chose this as his birthday dinner spot.  We rolled in fairly early on a Friday evening and were greeted and seated right away.   To start off, we went with a couple of appetizers: a cheese garlic bread and the chicken pot stickers.  The kids enjoyed the pot stickers but the appetizer only came with five pot stickers.  This is actually a pet peeve of mine (kinda, mostly just an observation).  I cannot for the life of me figure out why restaurants serve five items on an appetizer.  Why five?  It's an odd number and the only way it really works is if you have five people in your party and really, how often does that happen? If it's a couple, the fifth one sits there until someone decides they want to be the selfish one to eat the last one.  If you have a party of three, someone loses out!  Party of four, again, one extra sitting there until whomever takes it.  Let's go with six next time, a nice round number!  It works much better.  Party of two, three a piece.  Party of three, two a piece.  Party of four, one a piece and evenly split the last two.  See how nice that works for most parties?   Anyway, sorry, back on track. The garlic cheese bread was very good.  The star of the meal, as it turns out.  For meals, my youngest son went with the kids sliders, which he took one bite of and wouldn't eat anymore.  This kid LOVES burgers, so it tells you how these tasted.  I tried it and agreed.  Not good.  The birthday boy went with the bacon cheeseburger, which was pretty good.  My wife ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo and was OK with it.  I did the catfish dinner, which came with mashed potatoes and green beans.  It was all fine but nothing stood out honestly.   The service was good.  Our server brought my son a little dessert for his birthday without doing the whole singing thing.  He just turned into a teenager, so we appreciated her discretion on the singing thing because well, he's 13 and who knows how that would have gone down.   I am torn between two and three stars overall.  The service was good (a 4 star experience) but the food left a lot to be desired.  When you spend a good chunk of money, you'd like to feel like it was a treat, you know?  Something that was memorable and worth the money.  We didn't feel that here.  It just was an overpriced, underwhelming food experience.  I'm not one of those crazy anti-chain Yelpers who detests all things chain but in this case, I can honestly say that Cheesecake Factory is a place to which I won't return for a meal.  Look for me ordering some cheesecake to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=40

Barb E.,"Omaha, NE",2,24,,2.0,12/28/2016,"This place has some serious service issues. I met my friend here at 1 pm on a Wednesday, and the restaurant was packed. (Great for them!)  My friend's in-laws were in the bar area at a table so we decided to take their table as they were just leaving. Once the table had been bused, the server brought us water and bread and butter. I asked her for silverware, assuming this would prompt her to bring us the normal table place setting (napkin, silverware, plates, salt & pepper) but she only brought silverware. We asked for napkins and plates, she only brought napkins, so she had to go back a third time for plates. My friend ordered coffee and I ordered a beer. She brought the coffee, then brought us both beer. We told her we wanted to order soup and share a couple of appetizers. She said something like ""since you are sharing soup, would you like the bowl versus the cup since it's larger?"" I had to actually explain to her that we would like our own cup of soup and we'd share the appetizers.  After a long wait, the soup came out and it was cold. It took us more than 5 minutes to flag someone down to send it back. 10 minutes later they re-served the soup which was only slightly warmer than previously. A full hour and 10 minutes after we placed our order we had still not received the two appetizers. No one had checked on us since re-serving the soup. Once again we flagged down our server and told her to cancel the order and bring us the check. She asked us to wait while she spoke to her manager. She came back with one of the two appetizers and said that her manager will waive the charge for them if we'd still like them, or they could box them up. Neither one of us planned to have an all afternoon lunch, but we decided just to stay and have some. She brought the 2nd appetizer, but no plates, we just used our tiny bread plates. It was a small table and they hadn't cleared away any of our dirty plates, glasses or the soup bowls, so I tried to stack them and get them out of our way. Eventually our server walked by and stopped, grabbed some of our dirty dishes and put them on the same tray with food she was taking to another table. I almost stopped her, but I was too shocked by what I was seeing happen! Oh, and the food? We had the eggroll sampler and the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. They were just okay.

Mike K.,"Bennington, NE",0,79,,5.0,2/13/2017,"A review from one of my eighth grade students... Pros Great food Clean  Amazing desert Reasonable hours Cons Service takes a while Waiting for a table Busy          I have had many great experiences at The Cheesecake Factory. The Food is high quality and it has great prices. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a place to grab lunch or dinner and  dessert. They are open at reasonable hours Monday through Thursday they are open at 11:00 am- 11:00 pm, Friday and Saturday they are open from 11:00 am- 12:00 am. On Sunday they are open from 10:00 am- 10:00 pm. The prices range from $11.00 to $30.00 for most of the food items on the menu. They take reservations and its family friendly.          The longest I have ever waited for a table at the Cheesecake Factory is about fifteen to twenty minutes. The servers are nice and friendly but they can take a while to get to your table because it is always so busy. They allow reservation and they have carry out so it is great if you're lazy and you want to stop by after work and get something to eat. I would recommend the Chicken Picatta it is full of flavor and it's good if you like lemons.         Overall my experiences have always been great here the food is delicious and the environment is clean. Although it is very busy I think the food is worth the wait. The restaurant is family friendly but it is not overwhelmingly loud. The Cheesecake factory has a vast menu so there will always be something new to try. This restaurant is a great choice for any occasion. Another review from one of my 8th-grade students... Pros,  the food was good,  the building's design was realty cool  the people who worked there were really nice.   Cons,  there wasn't a lot of lighting,  confusion with the employees,    The Cheesecake Factory at Westroads mall is known for their cheesecake, hence the name. Just because it is all about cheesecake it doesn't mean that is all they serve. They have a variety of lunch and dinner items. The building is a dimly lit place with cool artwork decorating the walls. I think the restaurant is Egyptian themed but I am not sure.   When I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time I didn't have the best experience. I got there on a Sunday at about 3:30. It was surprisingly busy at this time. I have not gone on a different day other than a Sunday so I don't know if it is that busy every day. The time I arrived was the period in which they were switching shifts. So our waiter got confused. Even Though they were having some problems finding who was supposed to serve us, the employees were very kind and tried their hardest to fix the mess.  unfortunately, it was just a lot of waiting. When I came I was just there for the cheesecake. Let's just say I was very impressed. My family and I all ordered cheesecake to share with each other. The only other thing I ordered was a smoothy. The cheesecake tasted really good. It was rich and was everything cheesecake should be. My favorite was the white chocolate raspberry. On the other hand, my smoothy was not that great. It lost its flavor and tasted like ice with some mango. Even Though I didn't have a fantastic time, I think it is still a good place to go for a treat.    This is definitely not a restaurant for people on a diet. It is nearly impossible to resist such good looking food. Obviously, cheesecake isn't very healthy, but it can't hurt to have some every once and awhile. The only thing that really bothered me was that they didn't have much for lighting. It was hard to adjust after coming from a sunny day. I would not recommend you go there if you have trouble seeing in low light.

R J.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,,1.0,2/22/2016,"Wow, is this place overpriced. I had a bowl of the white chicken chili and it barely covered the bottom of the bowl. It also came with a tiny scoop of white rice. I took one look at it and called the manager over...for 14 bucks the amount was ridiculous. He took a small amount off our bill and explained to me that the portions are weighed and consistent with all locations. Well, that maybe true but then corporate should really then look at what is being served because this is a total ripoff. I literally had the entree done with about six bites. The taste was good but not worth the price. The prices of other items way overpriced as well. I will not be eating here again. And, for crying out loud, get the entrance way fixed. Chunks of loose concrete by the front door does not make for a good first impression.

We didn't even get our bread, I didn't even know about the bread until we looked around and every table had a loaf besides ours. Then when I paid, I went to get a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake and here is a group of employees who were too busy talking to one another, I kept calling out, "" Excuse me?

The first observation is the 80's Eclectic Hollywood, Miami Vice Don Johnson, interior décor, with a wall of Mordor's evil eyes staring at you. Quaint. Next observation was our great server Mandi. She answered all our questions, gave advice, told to get this instead of that, a very nice  personality. I was going to get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but she suggested the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo instead (she was from NOLA area, yet a-third Italian) It was very well presented and not too overwhelming seasoning that I have had in other restaurants who try to make Cajun foods. My mother liked her Angel Hair Shrimp (she is pretty picky). My brother and mother split the Original Cheesecake for dessert and they said it was the best they have ever had.

The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go for special occasions, but I feel it is just simply expensive for what you get. They have a huge menu and lots of options! They have amazing service and really take care of their guests. But I guess you pay for it all in the end with the bill.

Erik Y.,"Lincoln, NE",93,251,307,3.0,3/20/2015,"Why I like it:  HUGE menu, lots of variety on cheesecakes, and good drinks.  That's it in a nutshell.  Let me expand a bit.  Cheesecake Factory is a chain, so they automatically loose a star for that, but they are a upscale chain restaurant with very nice décor and better then average food.  Not everything at the cheesecake factory is good, I have eaten at a number of them and can tell you first hand things like shepherds pie and some of the salads are fairly blah.  However that said, they do have a few dishes I like.   1st, for appetizer I enjoy the firecracker salmon.  It is salmon wrapped in wontons wrappers and deep fried, served on a huge pile of red cabbage and drizzled with a nice teriyaki sauce.  Very tasty but not enough food for more then 2 people.  Heck, I have eaten it by myself as an app myself. Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls are also excellent as an App. 2nd.  They used to have an excellent Thai Chicken Pasta that I enjoyed but for some reason they got rid of it.  They still have some nice pasta options like spicy chipotle chicken and the pasta carbonara.  Other things I really enjoy include Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon, Fish Tacos, and the chicken and biscuits are excellent. It reminds me of a deconstructed chicken pot pie with peppery white gravy. And now for the cheesecakes.  Yes I have tried nearly every flavor at one point or another over the last 20+ years visiting a cheesecake factory someplace in the country.  In fact I visited my first one in Newport Beach, CA back in 1990.  I'm not even sure if its still there!  But, over the years I have developed a taste for a few of them, and can rank them in what I believe is their worst, to their best.  Here we go: 32. Low Carb Cheesecake with Strawberries  - Yuck 31. White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut  - Not a fan of white chocolate with caramel. 30. Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake  Coffee in dessert is not my thing 29. Tiramisu  I'll stick with the original, and I don't really like coffee in my desserts. 28. Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake  Not very good 27. The Original  Boring 26. Chocolate Mousse  Not a fan of mousse. I want a better chocolate. 25. White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  This one is ok, but again, not a fan of white chocolate 24. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple  Not bad, but they have better 23. The Original with Cherry Preserves  The original is good, and cherry makes it a little better 22. Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake  I like carrot cake, but this one is a miss 21. Key Lime  I like it, but it's a weee bit tart 20. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake  Getting better on the chocolate front but they have better 19. Mango Key Lime  This is a good option for tart and sweet. 18. Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake  This is a good one, worth trying. 17. Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake  Reminds me of banana cream pie, but better 16. Pina Colada Cake  Different take. I feel like I'm in the islands 15. Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake  Love me a turtle in any way. This is a good option 14. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake  For something so simple, it works.  Tastes like rich vanilla ice cream. 13. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel  Apple Pie Cheesecake.  It is good 12. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake  This is the only white chocolate cheesecake I actually like 11. Chocolate Tuxedo Cream  Vanilla and Chocolate twist.  Very good 10. Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore  This is one of my favorites.  Worth getting for sure. 9. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake  If you want chocolate, this one is great, but almost TOO much chocolate. it's fairly dark chocolate. 8. The Original with Fresh Strawberries  A classic, and very very good. 7. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake.  The best peanut butter cake I have had in some time.  Great if you don't want a cheesecake 6. 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake  Probably the best chocolate item they have.  perfect flavors 5. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough  I am so partial to chocolate chip cookie dough anything, and this cheesecake is excellent. 4. OREO Dream Extreme  If you like Oreo's, you will love this cheesecake.  I do. 3. Lemon Raspberry Cream  When you are sick of chocolate, this sweet and tart cheesecake is perfect.  My favorite fruit cheesecake they have.  2. Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake  This is also probably the best chocolate item they have. Honestly, this and the 30th aniv chocolate cake are both fantastic, but this one is readily available everywhere. 1.

Everything on the menu tends to be worth the money, but then again you are paying a little more for the portion sizes and experience.  The wait staff was friendly, but a little slow.  They never offered extra bread and actually could have come by more often, especially at the end of the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=100
Ben K.,"Portland, OR",62,299,,1.0,10/15/2009,"Pros: Dessert is good Cons: Everything else I remember my parents calling me all excited when they found out Cheesecake Factory was finally opening a location in Omaha. ""We're finally on the map!"" Okay, maybe it isn't THAT spectacular, but people in my hometown took the news as if the second coming of Christ arrived. I've eaten at Cheesecake Factories everywhere, and have always had one question: Why do so many people love this place? I can't stand it. Every location is way too busy (even in cities with strong restaurant scenes like Seattle, Dallas and Chicago), it's too loud, there's nowhere to sit, you feel rushed, it's overpriced, the menu is expansive, which is always a warning flag for me as they make many things but specialize in none, they give you way too much to eat and it had a bland, boring atmosphere to it. The Omaha location isn't any different. Omahans LOVE chains, which disturbs me as more chains are taking over from the charming local restaurants that I used to love in my hometown. Do yourself a favor: skip this place and give your money to one of the local restaurants out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=100
Cmh H.,"Omaha, NE",9,105,3,2.0,1/13/2012,"We were there around 3 mos. ago and the service took foreverrr. It looked like our server had 2 entire sections to contend with. All told, I think we were there for a late lunch for about 2 hrs. Totally ridiculous. I'm sure some of it was due to a delay in the kitchen.   The club sandwich is good, but huge, so if you are not going home right away, then what do you do with all the leftovers? You can't leave turkey sit in a warm car while you go out and about. Tried again today, having the Fish & Chips. The breading was barely crisp on the outside, all soggy in the middle and seriously, there was barely any fish inside the 4 pieces for lunch sized portion. Fries were average, coleslaw a little waxy tasting. Ordered a bowl of clam chowder soup, an extra $4.98. For the quality of my meal, I could have gone to Arthur Treachers or Village Inn for much less money. Strike that, just pick up some frozen fish sticks from Walmart and you'd have the same quality. Server seemed more preoccupied with chatting with staff elsewhere at the front counters. I wish I could have whistled loud enough to get his attention to call him over. Took forever to get the soup to the table (brought by a different employee finally), and then our server brought my meal out a minute later. He only had two tables to attend to, so not sure why he couldn't have checked back at the proper times. He also seemed to really not care about if my meal was okay or not, he seemed to rush past (to do what, I have no clue). His tip reflected his attitude. I think Cheesecake Factory needs to do better to get my business. We are not going to go out of our way to eat here and spend $50 on lunch again. Red Velvet Cheesecake is quite good, but was a bit on the dry side, so wonder if it was fresh or what. Avoid the fish & chips and as far as service, just hope for the best. Update: upon emailing corporate and giving feedback, they kindly passed my remarks along and I did receive a gift card in the mail.

Unfortunately, everything I've eaten here has been just the opposite. Bland, flavorless, forgettable...  The cheesecake is alright, but nothing extravagant, and definitely nothing to write home about.  If I was just rating on the basis of the quality of the meals I've had, I'd give this place one star. However, many of the meals come in massive portions, the design of the dining room is pretty neat (though childish), and most of my friends and family have been satisfied with their food, so they limp into a second star.

The cheesecake is obviously 3 or 4 stars in quality, but it costs $9.  I'm pretty sure I could buy the ingredients to make a whole cheesecake at home for that price.   The dirty martini I ordered (which our server said the bartender described as 'extra dirty) was also $9.  The blue cheese stuffed olives that are listed as part of the drink on the menu... I had to ask for after it showed up without them.  Plus, 'extra dirty'?  Really?  The irony here is that it may sound cute, but the 'dirty' is the olive juice... so you put extra olive juice in my martini?  Thanks, but no thanks.  You can just make it extra-ginny instead. The food is always good, nothing to write home about.  And the portions lend themselves to excessive eating.  I've never been absolutely disappointed with a meal here, until I get the check. I probably would have gone with the three stars if I didn't feel like they were holding me by my ankles to shake out all the loose change in my pockets.  All told, one martini, one dinner and one piece of cheesecake to go set me back $37.  I can think of far more fabulous places to spend that money in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=100

Nathan B.,"Churdan, IA",25,54,81,3.0,2/22/2012,"Okay, do not get me wrong...I am a BIG Cheesecake Factory fan!  I love the West Des Moines, Iowa location with all my heart.  I know what I like and I do not care what people who think they're ""foodies"" who rely on only local restaurants think.  If you're so cross that you think you too good to eat at huge, clean, beautiful Cheesecake Factory, and would rather eat at some rat trap local restaurant instead (not all local restaurants are like that, but I'm just giving an example if you went there and it was run down and dirty), be my guest (actually, don't be). THAT said, I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations, and this one was clean and nice looking like the others, but for Omaha's size, it was WAY too small.  The waiting area and the bakery area were consolidated into one area, making it very difficult for employees to wafer through the crowds with cheesecake for the bakery.  The waiting area itself is extremely small, and not enough seating was available for our wait (it didn't matter to me, but to someone who is disabled or can't stand for long periods of time, it would be).   Just on a side note: This was the first Cheesecake Factory that I've been to that is freestanding, and not connected to a plaza or major super regional mall. Once we were seated (we were quoted 15, and it ended up being 45...minus one star), the waiter promptly brung us bread (wheat is the best!) and took our order.  Me and the boyfriend's meals were perfect!  Had my usual Pasta Da Vinci with extra extra shrimp (overpriced, but awesome) and extra mushrooms, and had key lime cheesecake for dessert.   Customer service great...one star.  Decor...very nice...one star.  Food...awesome as always...one star.  No fourth or fifth star because of the small waiting area and the extensive waiting time to be seated. We arrived at 5PM on a Saturday evening, and boy was it busy!  Please plan ahead when deciding to come here during peak times.   Personally, I think The Cheesecake Factory would have been more appropriate to be built out by Village Pointe (or Regency Court), where upscale shopping is key.  Westroads Mall is the largest mall in Omaha (and all of Nebraska, for that matter), but not the nicest.  But I can't help that...thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=120

Patrick W.,"Bennington, NE",45,441,19,4.0,7/25/2010,"I know the reputation of this place (especially on this board) but I don't care.  I like it.  Now I've never had a great meal here but I've never had a bad one either.  For the most part, the food is somewhere between average and good and they're consistent.  This is a great place if you're with a large group and you can't agree on where to go.  There's tons of choices and something to satisfy just about anyone.  Recently, I tried the Morning Quesadilla and it was enjoyable.  It was huge and full of scrambled eggs, cheese, black beans, peppers, cilantro, bacon in a tortilla served with a side of pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.  It is the perfect meal for the morning after a late night at the bar.  It's even better when sitting outside when the weather is nice.  And while I enjoy the ambiance, it can be loud, and hurried.  Personally, I can't speak for the cheesecakes because I don't like 'em but the Carrot Cake is darn good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=140
Alexis J.,"Omaha, NE",2,44,,3.0,9/3/2011,I thought I would try it out. One of my girl friends was just bragging about it. Personally I thought the food was ok and the service the same.

Daniel A.,"Mebane, NC",14,163,15,5.0,2/17/2007,"The thing about the Cheesecake Factory is its expansive menu.  They have a menu that reads like an encyclopedia of food.  When coupled with a nice new building and a good staff this is a great place to go when you do not know what you want to eat, but want something good.

Charles G.,"Omaha, NE",4,130,,2.0,7/19/2008,"The Kmart of food.  As chains go, I've had worse, but this place is grossly overpriced.  The fact that anyone would spend that kind of money in there instead of patronizing any number of very good local restaurants for half the price boggles my mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=140
Brian F.,"Boulder, CO",0,10,5,3.0,3/19/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is decent chain restaurant that offers both extensive dinner and dessert menus.

Bethany K.,"Omaha, NE",3,33,,1.0,6/21/2010,"Okay, don't get me wrong on this.  The only reason I would ever step foot in this restaurant again would be to pick up a piece of cheesecake.  But, even then, i'd probably let my husband go in and get it.  Seriously, no joke.  I loved the Macaroni Grill when it was here in Omaha, but then it disappeared and we decided to try The Cheesecake Factory.  One night is all it took to eliminate that idea.  Here's my story... My then fiance and I walked into The Cheesecake Factory.  I had to use the restroom (we'd been running errands all day, non stop).  My husband was escorted to the table.  By the time I got there and found him, the waitor had already been by to check to see if we needed drinks.  My husband told him two waters and that we would be ordering alcoholic beverages.  The waitor came back about 10 minutes later and did not have the water.  He asked if we were interested in an appetizer and I told him that I wanted to order an alcoholic beverage.  He stared at me blankly and so I asked him a recommendation for their wine selection.  He gave me an evil stare and then turned around and said, oh my god, and turned back around and stared at me blankly.  Of course my husband and I looked at each other like there was something wrong with him.  I then snapped at him and told him that I wanted a double shot of jack and coke and handed him over my identification.  He grabbed it from me and hurt my hand.  Then he threw my ID back onto the table (the small plastic card bounced about 4 inches off of the table, I swear), then he turned around and wandered over to the other tables.  He was nice and polite to everyone else.  He was laughing and giddy with everyone.  Everytime my husband or I made eye contact with him, he made mean faces and it truly looked like he wanted to rape me and hit my husband, it was sick.  I then thought back to my dating experiences.  Maybe I'd dated the guy?  Um... NOPE!  I had never seen him before in my life.  My husband swears he'd never seen him before in his life.  The guy comes back with our water (this is 25 minutes after we were originally seated).  Not once does he try to upsell anything.  Not once does this man say more than a single word at one time to our faces.    Not once does he smile.  Not once does he say have a nice day, NOTHING.  My food was cold, which means he waited too long to bring it out.  My drink was watery, which means he waited too long to bring it out.  Yuck.  The second worst experience of my life. I repeatedly told my husband that we needed to leave and request a complimentary gift card or something.  He's like... just be patient.  I love my patient husband, but seriously?  I think not. I walked right up to the manager after the dinner and told him everything that happened.  He told the cheesecake counter to get us two free pieces of cheesecake of our choice and that he was sorry for the inconvenience.  I watched him, and not once did he ever approach the bad waitor we had.  I've been in the business long enough to know that if a manager does not request to speak with an employee on the double about an issue, that he never will.  It's just sad. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT HAPPENED TO ME (weird), it was the 2nd.  Both people were from different parts of town and worked in different restaurants and were different genders and different personality types.  There was no way that these people knew me or new each other.  WEIRD!! Omaha has the worst service. I have a theory on why I was treated like crap.  The waitor thought that I was my fiance's daughter (my husband looks much older than I am).  He assumed that I was under age.  He assumed that because I was in the bathroom when he came by that I was going to take forever to look at the menu.  He assumed that because it was a father daughter date that we wouldn't be spending that much... or maybe it was because I was wearing jeans with my button up blouse, who knows.  In future though, I bet that butthead gets fired at every job he has.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-omaha?start=140
