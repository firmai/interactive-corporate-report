47,Alisa N.,"San Antonio, TX",56,58,72.0,4.0,2012-01-09,I've been going to TGIF forever and a day now. They have good average food! I usually come here when I'm craving a good burger or the Jack Daniel chicken strips. The chicken strips are no longer offered as a lunch or dinner item but you can order the app as your main meal with a side of fries. Gotta love TGIF and we'll be back soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=40,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

32,Marc L.,"Cornelius, NC",20,27,19.0,1.0,2012-07-23,"It has been probably 6 or 7 years since my last visit to a TGI Fridays and now I remember why. Perhaps Im showing my age a bit here, but I recall 15 - 20 years ago that Friday's was the place to be and had relatively good food.  Alas, those days are long gone. We started with the Warm Pretzels and ""craft beer dipping sauce"".  How bad could that be, right?   Well, instead of pretzels I would swear that these were your average restaurant bread sticks with some sort of egg wash and salt added to them.  Other than the salt, these tasted nothing like a pretzel. My wife got the broccoli and cheese soup as well which looked and tasted exactly the same as the cheese dipping sauce for the pretzels with a few stems of broccoli thrown in.   We held out hope for the Burger and Salad that we ordered for out entrees, but there was no hope to be had.  The Bun was old and stale, the burger was definitely frozen and had a bad texture to it and of course, the fries were cold. My wife ordered the Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad.  She had 4 or 5 bites and was done.  It was just off tasting. The service was decent - what could be expected these days at the middle of the road chains.  We never saw a manager, but I guess if I was serving this food, I would be hiding in the back office as well. What a shame to see Friday's fall so far.   I mean, is it really that hard to make a FRESH Burger?  If the mall kiosk can make a pretzel, why can't this place.   I really had reasonable expectations going in, but yet they still found a way to disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148
39,Michael C.,"Concord, NC",72,54,8.0,3.0,2012-12-12,"It was busy when we went -ever table seemed to be taken- but my party of 5 didn't have to wait to be seated. The hostesses are very young but do their job well. The waiters/waitresses I have had have been good.  The kids ordered from the kids menu and enjoyed their meals. The adults in the party ordered the appetizer plus meal for $10 which is an amazing deal. It's a bit too much food for me. So, with all these positives you may ask why I gave the restaurant a 3. Well, the food just isn't great. The barbecue chicken flatbread was  dry- the kids loved it though. I didn't love the dragonfire chicken. I didn't like the veggies though. We ordered the strawberry smoothies and they were just bad. They were very icy and didn't have a lot of taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
46,Yana J.,"Charlotte, NC",12,4,1.0,2.0,2013-01-04,"This is was my first time at this location. Can't really complain about our food. We ordered spinach artichoke cheese dip with chips,  blue cheese beef burger for my husband, French onion soup for me, and kids meals for the boys - chicken fingers with fries. Our beverage was sweet ice tea, it was like drinking high fructose corn syrup...I almost vomited. Our waitress was very nice and only worked there couple of weeks. She switched out the teas with something else, but I asked her to cut mine with water. Well, when it arrived it tasted like chlorine ice sweet tea. Yuck! Seltzer water was not available.

They have a gigantic menu to please groups of people, but everything is just ok.  I got the French onion soup and the pretzels. The soup was very good. I did enjoy it, with all of it's cheesy goodness. The pretzels however were sub par. I mean who deep fries pretzels? The were greasy and the beer cheese that came with it was chunky. I would not recommend.  If you come to the mall on a Sunday or before a race at the track, they have Sunday Funday. You can get a 32oz beer for $3.

34,Jennifer C.,"Charlotte, NC",22,68,15.0,3.0,2013-07-21,"TGIF is your typical restaurant food. They have a couple of options that are unique to them (Jack Daniels items / sauce), but everything else is okay. We went here only because we were trying there 2 for $10 (1 app + 1 entree).   Menu was appealing because it was quite a variety even with the special.  However, on a Saturday night, it didn't seem like they had enough waitstaff to accommodate. We got seated pretty quickly, but had to wait awhile between the  apps  & entree. In addition, I had to ask another waitress for a to-go box and bag because our waitress was nowhere to be found. I absolutely hate that!  I got chicken and shrimp skewers with the veggie medley. The skewers were okay, but the zucchini and squash marinated and and served up was delicious.  It was seasoned very well.  I can't say I wouldn't go here again, as its right across from Concord Mills (convenient), but maybe a different time other than Saturday afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=20,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998
28,Jessica C.,"Rockwell, NC",24,27,59.0,2.0,2013-09-14,"Let me start off by saying the service was good.  It wasn't great, but it was good.  Staff here is very pleasant and polite.  They don't know their product 100% though.  As I asked what was in the rice pilaf, and was told, ""I don't know.  I think it has vegetables, maybe.""  There was no offer to go and check and I didn't want to make a fuss over it, but some people have food allergies so it might be good to know what's in the food you are serving.  My husband and I came here because I was in the mood for something Jack Daniels, otherwise we normally avoid Fridays, and I will tell you why. 1.  The menu.  It has changed over the years.  Some items are updated and some are classics.  But somethings need to be added, like a few more chicken options that aren't paired off with pasta or chicken fingers.  Also I would have loved to have Jack Daniels chicken if I didn't know it would have been just a small piece of chicken. 2.  The food.  It wasn't that good.  It was ok at best.  I ordered a steak medium well.  This means slight pink in the center at the majority of restaurants you go to.  Here it means your middle is red.  One end is completely over cooked while the other is slight pink.  I was really confused how this happened.  But it was red dead center, over done on one end and pink on the other.  I really didn't feel like complaining but I think they should know how to cook food evenly.  They also had a tomato and mozzarella salad.  It was horrible.  I thought this would be a light side.  It was heavy and the tomatoes were sitting in some liquid made of juice from the tomatoes and run off from the cheese and oil.  It made it slimy but thick.   Will I come back?  Not willingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

We had the wings as appetizer and they taste just out their TGiFridays frozen food line. I remember the sizzling chicken and shrimp being tasty; however not this visit. I know it has been a few years, but I really do not recall that icky marinara on the shrimp. I am almost certain they use to be scampi*shrugs* Our server was just okay and seemed to be little scattered and not as sunny as a few others.

30,Tyler A.,"Charlotte, NC",19,206,133.0,4.0,2014-01-21,Went here this last Saturday and I have no complaints. It's ALOT better than most chain restaurants like Applebee's and Chili's. Hostess was sweet and our server was attentive and funny. They had a good special on beer which the boyfriend loved. They also had plenty of deals like an entree with an app for 15 and many others that were similar. We ordered the potstickers for the app which were pretty good. Boyfriend got the appetizer sampler for his meal. A plate of meat so and he had complaints. And I got the sirloin medium and it was cooked to perfection. It wasn't packed when we got there around 3pm so I will definitely be coming here instead of attempting to maneuver the CCMills food court.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=20,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998

I assumed it was a hot sandwich but instead its a cold one. Not a deal breaker though. I really enjoyed it.

36,Cynthia S.,"Charlotte, NC",1,1,,1.0,2014-05-29,"Don't go to this TGIF!!!! The atmosphere and manager's attitude are both despicable.  My friend and I stopped in after 7 pm and the restaurant was partially crowded, so we were seated immediately. We saw the bus boys cleaning the table and seats with the same cloth; we saw employees using their cell phones while working; the talking/noise was unusually loud; the atmosphere was scary. We could hardly eat for looking around at the other clientele fearing for our lives.  We didn't know if someone was going to shoot or not.   We complained to the manager about what we were experiencing,  he didn't care, didn't apologize for any of it and was very nonchalant. He simply walked away.      Because we were so appalled with the atmosphere and what we saw, we called him back and asked for the GM's name/card. He became indignant, started getting loud and still did not care or apologize. When asked his name he said Chad (no last name)........cause he would be too easy to find on facebook.......hahaha!! ""He's the only Chad at that store and the only manager in the company named Chad."" Still no last name.......still he didn't care nor apologize......The total atmosphere at this TGIF has drastically changed!!!!    And oh, the hostesses at the front dot even know the manager's name.....they don't know who they are working for........and they also ask for Id when you are over 18 and not sitting at the bar!!!!!

The service overall was good, tho a little slow on bringing the food out. Which very likely could be the kitchens fault. The main issue with this place was the food. My sons burger was cooked well past well done and he wouldn't eat it. An 8 year old that usually eats well took about three bites and said he couldn't eat it. My wife ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was cooked nicely but it was pretty bland. I've had this dish at TGI Fridays before and this was subpar for them. I ordered the French Dip with no onions. Of course it came out with onions but no horseradish sauce. I'm not one to send it back (Ive seen the movie Waiting lol) so I picked off the onion and went on. The kicker was my Au Jus cup was cemented to the plate. I picked up the entire plate, food and all by lifting just the cup. How does this happen you ask? Well it was glued down with the cheese that should have been on my sandwich, unless that was cheese from the last patron lol. I probably shouldn't laugh at that. The only bright spot was our server. She was a little slow in things that came from the kitchen and seemed spread out across the restaurant. But she kept the smile and was very friendly.  They're so many other great food choices in that area that there is absolutely no reason not to avoid this place and go somewhere with more passion for the food coming out of the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=20,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

It looked like yesterday's chicken that had been reheated in the microwave. It was brown inside. Awful. The manager brought her food out the second time and ducked out of here like the place was on fire when she said it was still microwaved. This was terrible.

The folks that I was with said their steaks were tough, but to TGIF's credit my Sizzling Cheese Chicken entrée was nice.  The mash was good, the chicken was better.  Oh, and the Long Island Iced Tea was pretty potent too.   So it is what it is, but it's sad to see one person work horsed that way.  We left her a good tip because we were sure it wasn't her fault that the place was woefully understaffed, but I can't leave them a good rating because the experience left much too much room for decent customer service.   As it turns out pity is quite the kill joy.   Who can have a good time while your belly is growling, but you won't complain because you know the lone waitress is doing the very best she can?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

One of the runners that brought food to my table spilled half my food all over the table as she was trying to put my plate down on the table. The most unprofessional thing that i witnessed as an employee who was on break sitting with customers, being extremely loud and inappropriate and talking about x rated things with her friends. She was so loud I could barely hear my friend who was only sitting across from me. It was like all the employees were clumsy, forgetful, rude and disrespectful. Sorry,next time I'll go to another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
13,Mikayla S.,"Maiden, NC",0,2,1.0,2.0,2016-04-30,"Rude hostesses, hairy food and extremely undercooked steaks. My second bad experience at a TGI Fridays. I ordered the Flat Iron steak and I've had it before, and it was severely overcooked twice in my first visit. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back. BAD MISTAKE.  First off, the last two times I have come, the hostesses have been extremely rude and/or have ignored my existence. Once I got to the table, there was a brown sticky substance that I had to clean up myself.  I ordered my food and it came with two sides. Okay, I asked for seasoned fries and if I could substitute my second side for a side salad. Apparently they can't do that so I had to add a salad to my meal for an extra $4. When the salad came out there was, of course, a nice hair mixed in with my dressing. How wonderful.  By the time our steaks came out, we could already tell they were undercooked. Our waiter agreed and took the steaks back. Once they came out again, ten minutes later, they were still extremely undercooked.  The only think good about this place is their Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. I won't be coming back.  They did take off half of my bill, but still...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
31,Andrea A.,"Charlotte, NC",0,1,,1.0,2016-06-21,"Decided to go TGIF's in Concord off of Concord Mills BLVD, for dinner last night with my boyfriend because I had really been craving a burger, and I figured maybe TGIF'S would have some good burgers. The do not take temperatures on the burgers, meaning the beef isn't good beef because if they don't cook it well done then it wouldn't be okay to give to a guest, they could get sick. I know this because I have worked in restaurants as a server for years and still do. I don't like well done (burnt) burgers. They are dry and disgusting, every time. This burger was the same. But that's not the part that made the experience un-enjoyable, the servers right next to us at they're server station talking extremely loudly, cussing, saying horrible things about other people, is what made this experience so unpleasant. I know TGIF's is not fine dining in any sense, but I also didn't think the place would be so trashy. So my boyfriend and I decided to leave early because of this. I was appalled. I work at a fine dining restaurant, and if you were to act this way in front of guests you would be fired on the spot. When I asked for the server's name who was cussing, saying awful things about people, who made our experience so bad, they said her name was Ashley Keeetman. Please, if you must go to this embarrassment of a restaurant on Concord Mills BLVD in Concord, NC, and get Ashley as your server, ASK FOR A NEW SERVER, or leave. I guess it was my mistake for picking a TGIF's to eat at any way, but we will NEVER, be back. Big thumbs down for Ashley Keetman, and management for hiring people so appalling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
8,J. D.,"Gastonia, NC",80,17,,1.0,2016-08-11,We had 5 people in our group and there were 4 tops available.  They said they don't push tables together and told us at 9:30pm we'd have to wait 20 minutes.  We ended up in a corner booth in the bar. When we ordered my husband said not to put any green onions on his food because he is allergic.  His food came out with green onions.  Really? You can't get something that simple right? I'm so done with TGIFridays.  Bad service with mediocre food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

I go in, it's about 3 on a Monday, door magically opens by a smiling young girl. I ask to go to the bar. Lesa (maybe) is bartending, she greets me.  I order, and my friend shows up. We chit chat with her. She is super friendly, and funny.  Our food comes out fast, we got endless apps, and we chowed down!! We also took part in the 3.00 cocktails. It was awesome!! We got wings garlic and the Jack Daniels, cheese sticks, and fried green beans. All good going down, but it did upset my stomach later. Which is why I didn't give them 5 stars.  So to sum it up, all Friday's are basically the same. I've been in them all over the country, and it's always the same interiors.  My service was phenomenal. Lesa was absolutely the best service I've had out in months. I'm super critical of service too.  My food was pretty damn good. The drinks were fabulous! The cotton candy drink she made me is fantastic!  So thank you Lesa for making what I thought was gonna be a shit experience based upon the reviews a great time!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

5,Linda B.,"Charlotte, NC",11,112,5.0,3.0,2016-09-05,My husband is pickiest eater in the world. He loves baby back ribs here. I usually order something new on the menu. Tonight it was bruschetta shrimp fettuccine dish. The tomatoes overpowered the dish but it was okay. I'd like to suggest at least a piece of bread to accompany their pasta dishes.   The restaurant itself was well staffed for the dinner hour. Aesthetically I was not pleased with the floor in our area which was strewn in napkins and straw papers. Bright sunlight emphasized greasy finger and handprints on the windows. Makes me question cleanliness of areas NOT visible to diners. JC our server was courteous and efficient.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-concord-4,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
