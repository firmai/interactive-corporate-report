70,Janelle M.,"Owings Mills, MD",55,70,54.0,3.0,2012-06-13,"I've never been a superfan of the TGI Friday's franchise, but it's decent bar food. This was our first trip to this location. The food was sub-par. It came out hot but came out slow! The slowest service that I've ever experienced at a Friday's -- especially for a Monday night @9:45pm and no NBA/NHL/NFL games playing. The server had a great personality so that helped matters. I ordered the three for all (mozz sticks, BBQ boneless wings, pan seared dumplings). The dumplings are usually my favorite, and were good, but they were really brown and a little tough/overcooked. I may go back if I'm with a group and it's for drinks and conversation only. I most likely won't voluntarily come back for a sit-down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000004
78,Jay K.,"Columbia, MD",0,10,,2.0,2012-08-26,"I really hate to only give two stars for this review, but my dining experience this past friday (8/24/12) was so ridiculous that even though it ended up more or less satisfactory, the overall result was such that an ""A-OK' rating was just too much. Let me explain: My wife and I met two friends at the restaurant around 11pm friday night. We sat down and were attended to in short order by our waiter (whose I regrettably forget). He took our drink orders quickly and checked in on us frequently while we took our sweet time deciding what we wanted.  I decided on the black bean burger, hold the mayo and cheese with extra avocado and balsamic onions. Simple. He sent the order to the kitchen and we waited. And waited. And waited. I will admit that it was a busy friday night, but between the four of us there were two appetizers and two sandwiches - not exactly complicated fare. Our poor waiter had to come to our table three or four times to let us know that it'd be right out. Finally, our food came out - well, most of it. My burger for some reason came out a solid five minutes later than the other things we ordered.  When it came out it had cheese on it. I can't eat cheese. Called the waiter over, and he literally shook his head and apologized. The burger goes back, and I wait another twenty minutes. Meanwhile, the waiter is awesome - refilling drinks like crazy, checking up on us, the works. Seriously, this guy was a rockstar. The re-fired burger comes back out, instead of the onions that are supposed to be balsamic as per the menu description I get a pile of red onion slices that aren't raw, but haven't been grilled, either - they'e just sort of soft and warm. At this point my wife and friends have all but finished their food, and I'm laughing at how ridiculous this is. It's a freaking BURGER. it shouldn't take three tries to get it right. I call the waiter over, show him what's up and ask for the manager. The manager shows up a minute later and I describe to him briefly what the issue is and what I need. He handles it well - takes the burger back and apologizes then heads for the kitchen.  In the end I got my black bean burger, with extra avocado and onions, hold the mayo and cheese and the manager comped my meal. But damn. I ended up actually eating my food in the car on the way home because at that point we'd been there long enough for everyone else to eat and we had to start heading out so we could get some sleep.  So yeah. Two stars overall. I know friday nights are busy for a place like Friday's, but there's no way that a simple burger should take three tries. That's nuts. I appreciate the manager comping the meal, but when you think about it it was the least he could do. I would have appreciated getting my food on time so I could have eaten with my friends and gotten on with my night in a reasonable fashion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.8320000000000003

On Friday, 6/14/13 a friend of mine wanted to catch up and grab a drink and we are both on budgets. So we are like lets go someplace to get more bang for our buck! FRIDAY'S IT IS!!!   I loved the new décor. I had no idea that they were renovating but the place looked amazing. I did only go to the bar area and grabbed a table. The tables are bigger and thicker and the chairs have that nice cushion seating!! The same seats were are the bar. The only thing I didn't understand was the wood panel box above the bar that was holding the TV inside the bar area seating. I guess it was better/closer view for those sitting at the bar directly.   We had an awesome server named Bonnie was AMAZING and they have a new uniforms that were quite flattering. Just a simple place shirt with the Friday's logo and I believe they could wear whatever bottoms. Either way it was neat and professional for the atmosphere. My friend was running late but Bonnie took care of me to start. She told me about the happy hour specials and was very convincing that I tried one of the new tropical margarita with Malibu red. OMG!!! This drink was so awesome and half way done I was feeling pretty nice! SCORE!! I also ordered some spinach dip to hold me over since appetizers were half off.   Once my friend got there is was a drink and an half in and feeling great. Bonnie quickly came over to take her order and took our food order for more apps and everything was out quickly. There was no issue with the food and the drinks just continued to be great. For happy hour on Friday they have a DJ and that just made the evening even more fun to add great music to the mix. I had the best time I have had at this Friday and will be going back soon. I slept like a baby when I got home.

31,Fola B.,"Houston, TX",6,12,,1.0,2013-08-27,"Let me start off by saying I should have gone with my first instinct and gone somewhere else.  The whole dining experience sucked the minute we walked in. Typically at a restaurant where you are seated, there is someone at the front desk to sit you down, not this time. We walked in and there was no one there, we waited by the door, and after about 3 mins a girl showed up with a really bad attitude, it was only after she sat us down was she able to crack a smile.    We ordered appetizers, and while the actual appetizers were good, the appetizer plates were wet.  I ordered a salad and a side of sweet potato fries, I've got to give credit where credit is due, the fries were great, the salad on the other hand was a miss, I had requested certain items off my salad due to dietary restrictions and it came with all the things i could not eat, needless to say i did not bother eating my meal.  The other two people I was with ordered the same meal and one found hair in her food, not very good, our waiter was very apologetic and said it had never happened before, that may or may not be true, the bottom line is that it should NEVER happen.  Asides from our waiter, who was really nice, the entire dining experience was horrid.

60,Amanda H.,"Cockeysville, MD",43,73,,2.0,2014-04-30,"TGI Friday's continues to leave me with mixed feelings, but a little negative than positive. After swearing to never visit the Towson Town Center location again, I decided to try this one. The food was delicious, as always. My steak was cooked perfectly, everything was served hot. The strawberry passion fruit iced tea was super-good. That's where the positive ends. I had a coupon for a free entree and they wouldn't take it, the coupon said it was good until May 10th, but the manager refused it. I used my smart phone to find another coupon for a free dessert and that was accepted. The server was really slow with everything, I don't get why a refill takes more than 5 minutes, but at least my son got his refill. I asked for more water and never got it.  We had to eat dessert with our dirty dinner dishes on the table. We left before the server came back and cleared our plates. The annoying thing is that the server would even put dessert on the table when everyone in my party still has their dirty in front of them. I had to get up and clear all of the dishes to the other end of the table. Apparently, this was not a problem at all for the server. She could have at least thanked me for doing her job. The check came and the dessert discount wasn't on it. I had to flag down another server and ask to find my server since my server might not have come back to the table until closing time. She took her sweet time fixing the discount, but we finally got everything paid for. Seriously, the check was delivered to my table at 6:58 and I couldn't get it right and paid for until 7:22. Ridiculous. I'm sorry, but that deserves only a 10% tip.

48,Kelli B.,"Ellicott City, MD",21,112,70.0,1.0,2014-08-31,"Lol, well where do I begin? Lets start with this establishments existing rating. How they have managed to hold onto 2.5 stars is a mystery, but I'll be happy to help knock them down another peg. I know that seems harsh right, but hear me out here. And the story goes a little something like this.  This place used to be a decent place....years ago. I can remember coming to this fridays years ago with my parents, and then my friends when I was able to drive and I along with the rest of the community have just watched it decline. And I think after tonights visit, I'm done with visits.  My mother, aunt, cousin and I arrived there on sunday 8/31/14 around 950pm. The server, I remember her name but wont put it in here because this review is gonna be bad, showed up to the table I would say about 15 minutes after I got to the table. I was going to ask the host was anyone serving the area we were seated in but I decided to wait it out. She obviously had not been to the other tables in her section because everyone in the general area seemed to be irritated with her absence. Because of this observation, we decided it would be best to tell her our food and drink order all at the same time because who knows when we would see her again.  About 25+ minutes into sitting and waiting we finally got our 4 drinks (Did I mention the place wasnt busy at all). While we were waiting, the person across from our table, tore apart her very pink burger and threw it onto the plate. She too, also irritated from our servers absence, complained to the server, manager and then ended up leaving, I believe before her check came. The food was just ok, I thank God that it was hot. The chicken didnt appear to be all that fresh looking. I was actually wondering, under the sauce that was put on it, what color would the cooked chicken have been...it looked a little gray. lol.  I cant remember if the server came to ask us how was the food, she could have, or maybe I was just imagining we had a decent server that followed restaurant protocol. My mother asked the server to go a little heavy on the ice cream, because she loves it so much, and the server obliged (that was nice i admit). I must have said something about how I fully planned on doing the survey, which I think she didn't plan on because she went into some speech about please give her a 9 or a 10 or they would get in trouble. We all just kind of looked at each other and waited for the server to walk away before we kind of had an unsaid moment between us all where we thought 'that's never going to happen.' Then to make the situation even more awkward, she came back and repeated the same thing and added that they have meeting about why the state of the restaurant is so poor....just odd.  I took pictures which I will post of the dirty dishes sitting on the surrounding tables that had been sitting there for some time. The floor was dirty and the place had a funny smell. There was no soap in the mens bathroom.  I did the survey , failed it, I did rate them well on the exterior of the building.  This location, I'm surprised its still in business. If I do have to go to a fridays, I think I will do what I've been doing which is to drive past this one and go to the one  in Towson.  In this particular instance, I recommended we go here because it was late and I wanted to crawl under the table in embarrassment for recommending it. Due to the condition of the floor, I felt it better to sit in shame in my seat.

I ordered the sampler appetizer for my meal to keep it simple and it was just underwhelming. The presentation was all bad considering it came out on a white dinner plate. The wings were dry as if they had been sitting under a great lamp for a while. The pot stickers were fine I could have passed on the cheese sticks though.

To top it off the waitress gave someone my strip points! All that after waiting 1 hour to be sat. That was the first visit. Swearing I wouldn't go back, I ended up going yesterday for a friends birthday. The service was slow again but I blame management because there was only 1 server for the entire bar and it was crowded. The final straw was moments ago when I went to eat my sizzling shrimp and chicken at home. I ordered it to go yesterday.  It was brought to the table on a plate to which I requested it be boxed. It returned in a container and a bag or so I thought. I went to sink my teeth into my dinner only to learn I was given someone else's Jack Daniel's wings.

We put in our food and drink orders at the same time since we'd had a while to decide although she also told us that the ribs did not come with sides when the hostess told us they had.....then we waited for nearly twenty minutes without even our drinks. She brought out our drinks a water and a beer just before the food.....which she had gotten partly wrong.....so she sighed over it and said she'd try to figure out how to get us the proper rib option in a very put out manner......which she did a bit later. She checked on us briefly but did not refill my water......fifteen minutes after we finished eating I turned to the nearby host stand and asked for the check and a box. The hostess brought me a box and had the waitress bring me the check.

I haven't been much since they toned down the decor and it does seem a bit antiseptic now and bland. With that said it shouldn't be that bad.  First off the menu is a lot smaller than I remember as are the portions. The sizzling chicken and cheese I had was good but the breasts were small. My wife's jack Daniels steak was a nice size and my kids both had burgers but the fries weren't heaping, they were like a McDonald's small.  The burger was terribly under seasoned and bland. My son eats everything and left that halfway done.  The appetizers were strong which is great for a place like this to maximize sales and my son had a great milkshake. The service initially was lacking. We waited for 15 minutes for no real reason after waiting to be welcomed in.

The restaurant isn't very busy and we sit in a booth by the door. 5 minutes later no one has come to greet out table never mind asking for drinks. 10 minutes later still feeling invisible so we flag down the host and ask for him to find our waitress. He storms off in a huff and our waitress finally arrives. She explains she was going over a survey with another couple  ( remember this its important later )  by this time we waited so long we put our drink and food orders in at the same time. 2 pick 3 appetizer samplers and a side of mac and cheese for the third person at the table. Waitress comes back to give us an update our drinks are ready but then she says she has to wait to get them from the bar (confused face ) and the food should be up soon but would we all like to fill out a survey to get $8 off of each of our bills. She said that verbatim everyone would get the 8 off of we filled out the survey. I even repeated it to the waitress to be sure Drinks finally come. Im pretty sure the one non alcoholic drink we ordered had vodka in it and the rum punches were so strong it ruined the drink. Just like drinking rubbing alchohol. So 2 samplers come out buuutttt no macaroni and cheese. That would arrive more than halfway through everyone elses meal. I hate when food isnt timed correctly. Im not going to talk about the food quality but to say its a Friday's the food was decent nothing out of this world.  Now this survey i take it and give  the link to my friend so she can take it. She can't take it because the link can only be redeemed once. I check with the waitress and she says yea only 1 per table. When i point out thats not what she said she was kind enough to look abashed and said she would have her manager take off the 8$ from each check because she wasn't clear.  No harm no foul im just ready to go at this point.  Brings back the check and says well my manager said no so i toom 4$ off each check instead (insert another confused face ) the manager never came over to clear the matter up and she just dropped the check and left. Well oh ok no time to ask any questions i need to get back to work  I dont know why i set myself up for failure i know these types of chains arent great but i expect decent service at the minimum and if a member of your staff gets a deal wrong then tbe customer shouldn't be punished and it would have been nice if someone came and spoke to us about it but hey.

The bar was restricted access as I only came there for happy hour. Upon speaking to the manager he said that we would be able to receive happy hour specials at a table due to the inconvenience. During my visit my original server Keon I believe was his name was fired (which I thought was a huge mistake as he made my already terrible experience a lot more enjoyable) they cut him during the shift which was extremely unprofessional and I had to find a server to continue my order. I did not receive happy hour prices as promised but Leo the server that I got to help me not only picked up our table he took on his and the fired servers table and was exceptional due to the circumstances. I ended up having a great experience because Leo was extraordinary at his job!!!

55,Dash S.,"Baltimore, MD",34,85,32.0,1.0,2015-08-10,"Before kids... my wife and I used to go and eat at Friday's...(read drink at Friday's) often. I really happened to be in the mood for Friday's shrimp. So I decided to take 2 of my 3 children while my wife was out with our other child.  We went in and had a slight wait prior to being seated despite there seeming like there was plenty of seating available.  Once our waitress came over she took our drink orders and when she returned she didn't leave straws. This is a pet peeve of mine. So my kids with their kids cups can't get to their drinks, because they have tops and just that little straw hole that has to be poked out. When she returned to take our order she finally left straws and mentioned the endless appetizers. She explained how the appetizer I was looking at worked and then gave us a few minutes to decide on our order. Mind you I came in for Friday's Shrimp... After looking it over I decided to order the endless boneless wings. My son wanted chicken fingers and my daughter picked the kids sliders. We then placed out order and the boneless wings came out rather quickly, great! This is going to be great I think. One problem... I was given one set of utensils and no plates for my kids... I had to ask for plates for them, when they came I had to then ask for utensils for them... ARGH are you kidding? The waitress brought back plastic utensils for my kids. Better than nothing I guess. I shared my boneless wings with my kids and just about as we were done the boneless wings their food arrived.  I then asked our waitress for my next order of boneless wings and I asked to change up the flavor. She informed me that she has already put in an order with the flavor I wanted, and to switch it up wasn't going to be a big deal as they were coming up all the time. So I wait... and wait... and wait... my kids have finished their food... and still nothing. Our waitress has been back to our table multiple times and still nothing. I finally after a good 45 minutes from the time I got the boneless wings I decided to ask for a manager... I recount my experience. Bottom line...

59,Alex D.,"Owings Mills, MD",103,29,,1.0,2015-08-15,"If I was able to leave no stars I would. Here is how the night began... Showed up at 10:30 on a Saturday night, extremely loud DJ in the bar and a party to the side. 50% of the tables are empty so we assumed everything would be fine.  We are handed a buzzer and told the wait would be 25 minutes. On a Saturday night with a full restaurant that's understandable, but it was an empty restaurant with servers and hosts standing around chatting. We decided to wait anyway.  About 20 minutes into our wait a host mentions the bar is self searing but the music IS SO LOUD it's not worth it and would not be enjoyable.  We continue to wait and three or four more tables are now waiting as well. Tables stay dirty as patrons leave and yet no one is seated.  I asked 45 minutes later (from when we arrived) when we would be seated and we were assured NEXT...well EVERYONE was next, even guests that showed up 35 minutes after we did.  So finally seated at 11:15 and we didn't have a server come by until 11:30. 15 minutes for a greet? Out of control when there are 8 tables maybe and half a dozen servers.  Dustin did a fair job, but there was no customer service just basic drinks and order.  There is no manager present, no kindness for the  wait and the food is subpar.  Hosts are running food and the bar has wasted patrons and very young guests with the intensely loud music.  If servers have time to sit at a table while guests haven't been helped that's a problem.  Where is your waitstaff? Where are your bussers? (We saw ONE older woman busting her butt and no one helping her) Where is your kitchen? 17 minute tickets for appetizers when you advertise endless apps? WHERE THE HELL IS A MANAGER?! It's currently 12:25 and we are still waiting on orders.  There is no pre-busing so our table is dirty.  The list could continue...but at this point it's useless. If you come here prepare for a poorly run establishment is every sense of the phrase.  Shape up Friday's. Update: Food was awful, tasted like it was frozen and cooked half way.

After eating 1 wing, I went to get my second an there is was...... A long black synthetic hair! Yuck!!!! I called the bartender over and discreetly told him there was a hair in my food. He said well it's not mine, and took the plate away. He didn't return to the table, offer to refresh our drinks - nothing. The manager brings out a new set of wings. I told him I'm sorry I don't want anything from that kitchen. There was a hair in the food... If he had asked me I would have told him not to put another order in. The manager took the food. Didn't offer an apology, nothing. The bartender seemed to have an attitude that I didn't want the wings and didn't come to the table. Finally we caught his eye and he said I'll bring your check. Not did you need anything else....which at that point we didn't- we wanted to leave - but thanks for asking. I won't be back... Two bad TGIF experiences in two days- this restaurant has lost its appeal.  Finally, when he brought the check he jokingly said, maybe it was your hair in it- pointing to my friend that was with me. She was like how you figure, the food never came near me. Then he said again it wasn't him- he's bald and said how he looked in the back and no one has long hair. So I'm lying?

The waitress offered an explanation but only after we asked what was up. She also didn't apologize and didn't seem phased by it. At other chains, when food is taking a long time, they usually offer a dessert or something, but we didn't even get an apology. The food and drinks were good which was the only saving grace of the night. This restaurant needs to get it together. I won't be back, especially with Foundry Row, and Buffalo Wild Wings right down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=20,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
44,Tiffany L.,"Laurel, MD",197,23,51.0,3.0,2017-05-28,"I went to the establishment and walked in it took five minutes for the host to come back to the host stand. I then ask about placing a to go order he pointed to the back of the restaurant near the kitchen double doors.  I walked over there and waited another fifteen minutes and then finally I asked a server in passing who takes to go orders , the server said oh I will get someone. I waited longer so then I go sit at the bar and explained what happen the bartender was kind . The bartender took my order and I got a drink . I ordered a southern fried chicken sandwich, I waited a half an hour for the sandwich. I get hold home and my sandwich is over cooked it is friend so much that it is hard. I wasn't in the position to go back because I had gotten a ride . THe over all experience wasn't great at all , if I were able I would have gotten a ride back to the establishment and gotten a fresh sandwich .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

40,Charmain Y.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,6,,5.0,2017-08-07,"One of my favorite spots. I love going to the bar to have a drink or two and the endless apps. It really saves money and they have so many other great deals. The cheese cake is delicious. It is something for everyone here. My children love going too. They enjoy the foods, mac and cheese, fries, flat bread, pasta, and desserts. I also love the TGIF points that you can use as well. I always end up with a free entree or dessert. DJ at the bar on Thursdays. In the evening the bar is almost like a lounge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
18,Marta P.,"Parkville, MD",51,2,,1.0,2017-08-13,"This is probably my favorite restaurant but in the worst place ever. They're always ""short staffed"" and always have a reason for not being able to seat you down for 1-2 hours. Terrible terrible service too every time we come here. They give you a stank face if you don't tip them for their terrible service too. Terrible terrible terrible. I would give them negative stars if I could. The cups have huge cracks in them and I cant enjoy my food without thinking my beverage will spill on me. This place is way below average. Wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE and I mean ANYONE.The bathrooms are dirty and the food is dry and disgusting. The manager does not manage anything well at all. This location isn't even yelp-worthy. No one needs to know this place exists. Go to TGI in White Marsh y'all !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
11,Ravon H.,"WINDSOR MILL, MD",138,232,149.0,2.0,2017-09-18,"Not great at this location.  The food is good but the service is not.  Every time I come here even if its not crowded the wait is long.  The greater wasn't friendly and they always take a while to get you seated.  Once seated I was there a good ten minutes before a waitress came by to get my drink order.   Then took forever to get a beer, I could have walked to the bar a poured it myself in half the time.  I should have known to order my food at the same time but unfortunately I did not.  So it was about another 15 min to put my food order in.  I love the Jack Daniels sauce and that's the only reason I would come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
13,Lindsay A.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,13,,1.0,2017-10-12,"My husband and I called in a to go order. I ordered salmon and he ordered ribs. After about 40 minutes after the order was placed our food finally came out. Unfortunately they screwed up the order and gave my husband the wrong ribs. So after waiting about 40 minutes or more for a simple order we were told we could either take the wrong order, or wait another 20-30 minutes for them to cook the correct ribs he ordered to begin with. I'm 9 months pregnant. So yes. I'd love to sit half an hour while my food gets cold to correct your mistake. So long TGI Fridays. Your service has sucked for a long time anyways. You definitely just lost our business. Get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
7,Michaek S.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",75,288,87.0,4.0,2017-10-17,"Hey it's a Friday's- what can you expect?  But it's actually surprisingly good!!  I have an old friend I meet there regularly- it's a half way spot between our homes. The staff is always very polite, prompt, and friendly.  Beer selection has a few locals on tap as well as usual domestics and always cold, tasty, and reasonably priced.  The food may depend a lot on corporate kitchen frozen- but it is very high quality frozen!!  Burgers are always tasty with a nice charcoal flavor that may be liquid smoke but it works! Nice Brioche buns, good thick crispy bacon, pipping hot crispy well seasoned fries, vinegar-based not to sweet slaw-  what's not to like?!  I've rarely ventured off the basics given it's a chain- but when I have I've been pleasantly surprised.  Their spicy dishes often have real heat, use real cilantro, all veggies are fresh. Ambience is comfortable- nice, dark, quiet, clean with cushy booths. Bar is comfy too with nicely visible TVs.  It's not the trendiest place but as a good spot for burger, beer and chill for a bit in burbs it's great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
2,Matthew S.,"Baltimore, MD",220,125,102.0,2.0,2017-11-01,"I feel like the bar and restaurant here are two different places.  Every time we give this place another chance and come in for an actual meal, we end up leaving without even being seated. It's the same story every time. We arrive, walk in and let the hostess know we'd like a booth on the restaurant side and then get told there will be a wait because they are understaffed. We look around, see no one eating or seated on the restaurant side and promptly leave b/c why would we wait to be seated in an empty restaurant?! Obviously by ""understaffed,"" they meant that none of their servers bothered to show up that day.  The bar side is another story entirely. Stop in pretty regularly for their ""All Day Happy Hour"" promotion and get prompt service from the bartender, even when there is a crowd. Drink prices are decent (3-4 dollar for a draft beer, 5-6 for their mixed drinks) and food comes out quickly when we've ordered it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

0,Cherita A.,"Owings Mills, MD",51,115,88.0,3.0,2017-12-11,Eh. It's a TGIF and I came for girls night out. Quite honestly there would be no other reason that would lure me here. The gals planned to meet at 6 pm. I arrived a few minutes early and the parking lot was pretty empty. I found that odd for a Friday at 6 pm. We sat ourselves in the bar hoping to take advantage of happy hour specials. Not much on the happy hour specials menu for a Friday. I ordered a Tito's strawberry mule just like the woman sitting next to me. Our drinks didn't look or taste the same. We both enjoyed our drinks but found it disturbingly odd. The all you can eat apps only include 5 apps and none fit my restrictive pescatarian diet. I do enjoy the fried shrimp with Jack Daniel's sauce. It did not disappoint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
1,Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",29,191,220.0,1.0,2018-01-02,"Horrible dining experience. Went with two friends and we put in an online reservation at 3pm for 3:30pm, which was an available time slot. I arrived at 3:33pm and stood at the front while the hostess sat a table looking at me and talking on her phone. It took her several minutes to acknowledge me and she when she did, she was still on her phone talking. I told her we had a reservation and she said it would be 15 minutes. I explained how we choose 3:30pm as our time. She said there was a wait yet it was empty except for the bar area. We didn't get seated till closer to 4. My friend ordered the Grilled Citrus Soy-Glazed Chicken. It came out came out as salmon instead of chicken. All of the vegetables looked wilted and like they had been sitting cooked and were just warmed up. We had to send her order back. My other friend ordered the BBQ chicken salad. It did not have avocado like the description stated. The chicken was cold but it was suppose to be hot. The salad looked nothing like the picture.  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich. I substituted the jack cheese for white cheddar. The cheese was just a piece of the cheese melted into a chunk. It did not cover the chicken even a little. I also asked for regular mayo instead of the spicy mayo. It came out with the spicy mayo instead of the regular. The fries were not hot. I had to send it back to have the order remade and the fries were still cold. Our waiter seemed nice but he never checked on us or asked how our food was. He was often no where to be found. We had to ask another staff member for assistance twice. He was extremely slow with giving us our drinks and taking our order. Our food took an hour to come out and it was still wrong.  My friend went to use the restroom and went the wrong way and asked the bartender where the restroom was. He said ""go outside and use the bush to the left as a bathroom."" Very unprofessional and not okay to say, even as a joke. Worst dining experience. It seemed that management overall and staff were all very slow and were not able to accommodate the small number of people dining or get our orders right. I would not recommend this location at all. It does not even deserve the 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
