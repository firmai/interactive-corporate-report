Trushit O.,"Langhorne, PA",35,106,80,5.0,11/10/2017,"CPK is a chain that is a must go. The fusion food here is very well put together. Food: we love the food here and the food can be customized to vegetarian friendly diets. For appraisers, you cannot go wrong with the Thai Crunch Salad (avocado substitute for chicken). Entree: tostada pizza & Thai chicken pizza (no chicken) Service: service is always attentive at this and KOP location. Ambience: the seating and lighting in comfortable",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Brian C.,"Quakertown, PA",9,4,,2.0,11/19/2017,"If you want a brief summary, scroll to the bottom. So... waited ~25 mins to be seated (party of 2) Interestingly, we saw maybe 4 or 5 tables that were empty. We were not sure why we had to wait that long when tables were available but that is fine. After being seated, we were ready to order since we decided on what to get while we were waiting. Guess how long we waited to get water and bread? another 20 minutes. Funny part is WE had to call a server and ask to get us some water and ordered food because I felt like we were going to wait for amother 20 mins if we didnt call someone. she ""kindly"" told us that she will take care of us as if she is doing us a favor... Interesting... but anyways, so we ordered our food, then the host comes to us about 5 minutes later asking if somebody came by... so we told him we had to call someone but we did order... about another 5 mins later, host comes out with bread and plates... still no drinks, no napkins or no utensils...  Food did come out. we ordered Spicy chipotle pizza (I think that was the name) and garlic fetuccine with shrimp. We thought... well food is here so let us just enjoy the food and get on the way. Unfortunately, fetuccine is cold... and the person who took our order...(dont know her name because she never told us) was no where to be found. another server came by asking if we need anything so we told her about the fettucine. she took the food back and brought it out later warm. the server (the first one) stopped by once and we told her about the fettucine but after that she did not stop by to see if we were doing okay or whatever until we were clearly done.  Pizza was fine, pasta was okay... but the service made me not want to stay and finish the food. i dont know whether somebody got sick in middle of a shift but it was a ridiculous visit. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- visited on sunday evening time to be seated: 25 mins time waited for bread: 45 mins time waited for water and utensil: 50 mins will I ever come back? Maybe at another location but not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Emily C.,"Lansdale, PA",29,62,62,1.0,11/19/2017,"Absolutely worst service ever. Waited forever to get even water. And another long long wait. We did not have designated server. We had to grab random server to order. Food came out cold/undercooked.. recooked pasta for us but no compensation for that. Which we didnt even expect them to compensate. totally unhappy, disappointed, frustrated about this service and food..  My partner and i went in for dinner on sunday evening. We waited approx 25min to be seated. And when we sat, we did not get served and had to wait for another 15 mins. We eventually grabbed random server and asked for water. The host brought us bread without water, napkin, and utensils. Later, we asked another server to bring us water and utensils. And the other server came and received the order like she was doing our favor. We ordered pizza and garlic cream pasta. Pasta was served cold, undercook, totally not appealing. We had to bring up that matter to the server. Brought us warmed pasta. No water refil, no extra napkins, nobody came to check on us after that. It was such an unpleasant dining experience  we went in there with good mood for sunday dinner , but came out lousy mood... will NEVER return here EVER!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting

Karen F.,"Media, PA",2809,3911,7,3.0,9/22/2017,"Food was 4 stars, service about a 2. I was dining alone - and is often the case - they tried to put me at the bar (high top) and I asked nicely to please be seated at a lower table. They gave me one (it was not yet busy - early part of lunch crowd, and I know what a pain it is to seat a single) and then basically ignored me. That said, my $9.99 half BBQ chicken salad was delicious - I added $3 worth of avocado. I love their herbal ranch dressing.

Marianna C.,"Plymouth Meeting, PA",20,137,84,4.0,7/21/2017,"For a chain, this place is pretty decent. I really love their veggie pizza with goat cheese, it's phenomenal and not grossly filling. The dough is good too-not overly crispy but not soggy to the point where I can barely eat it without it falling apart.  They have plenty of other yummy options on the menu too-my friend really loves their pasta dishes. I usually just get pizza though. It is a pizza joint after all :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
April A.,"Blue Bell, PA",0,16,1,3.0,6/19/2017,"We stop here frequently, at least 3 times a month, for take out.  The salads are excellent and usually the thin crust pizza is good. Problem is, it's not consistent. The size of the pizzas varies from week to week, as well as sauce, cheese, etc.  The last visit was the worst. When we got home, we discovered not only did we get the wrong pizza, it was burned to a crisp. If they would have served this at table, it would have been sent back, but they trust you won't turn around and run back, after you get home. We could not eat 3/4 of it.

Steve T.,"Philadelphia, PA",692,398,4,4.0,3/26/2017,"Everybody loves pizza, and pizza...and gluten in general...is what's on the plate here at California Pizza Kitchen.  We started off with their very tasty bread basket, served with an herb olive oil perfect for dipping.  Ahh...hot, fresh bread.  Tough to beat.  But wait...more bread to come. Our appetizers included their bianca bread which was covered with parmesan cheese and sage.  Delicious.  We also enjoyed their hummus which came with...you guessed it...more bread in the form of flatbread wedges.  Excellent hummus and as good as anyone else's, probably better. Dinner was...bread, but covered with mozzarella cheese, prosciutto, sauce, and sausage.  Yeah some call this pizza, but in light of the gluten overload let's just stick with bread covered with stuff.  Really, if you enjoy thin crust pizza this is good. We left completely stuffed with bread-based dishes, all of which were solid.  We then experienced the inevitable gluten crash causing a Walking Dead zombie state, followed by food-baby bumps the next morning.  If gluten is your thing, this is the place.  Off to the gym.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting

They were tasty and full of fish and toppings. The tacos also came with chips and salsa.  When you eat here you will not regret eating out. There are so many healthy choices to choose from!

Dustin M.,"Conshohocken, PA",88,177,50,5.0,1/31/2017,"I like CPK in general, but this one is the best one around here. It's got outside seating, a long bar counter, and good service. They seem to change up the menu a lot, and the additions never disappoint. Obviously the original BBQ Chicken Pizza is a classic, but their entrees are good and worth paying a little more than a pizza. Fish, pasta, and salads are all worth trying. I've gotten catering here for work, and the driver showed up on time, set stuff up, and brought stuff I'd forgotten I'd need. Everything was hot even though my building is in Conshocken. You should get in the free Pizza Dough club for cash back. Definitely worth it. Since the kitchen is open, you know they're doing things correctly. A friend of mine has celiac, and they have a lot of certified glutton free options. The wait staff has always been friendly to me. Some remember me even though I'm not there a lot. Managers have always checked to make sure the experience is good. As long as they keep doing stuff this way, it will be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Antonina E.,"Blandon, PA",49,82,263,4.0,2/2/2017,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this place. My father and I are big critiques when it comes to pizza, and considering this is a chain, neither of us were dissapointed. Mamma happily munched away on her margherita as well. My dad and I shared the white mushroom (I added chicken) and the roasted garlic chicken with carmelized onions. Those onions though. Hit. Them. Up. The crust is crispy and chewy without being too thin, and they were perfect size pies in my opinion (as in plenty to take home). We also tried out the hummus app with pita. The hummus had a very distinct taste to it which I could go either way with, but the pita needed work.  I also got fancy with the arugula, avocado, sundried tomato salad. I eat those things out of the jar, so yeah, it was delightful.  As far as the atmosphere I absolutely love the open circular concept. Our waitress was pleasant, helpful, and quick to refill my glass as well. Overall, I was very pleased and would definitely reccomend this place. Ill probably go for some pasta next time :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Tara B.,"Garnet Valley, PA",42,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"I had gone in ahead to make sure there was seating available, since it was NYE, and though the hostess was not at the desk, I could clearly see several open booths and tables. After waiting a few moments with two other families I went out to get my companion who is in wheelchair.  We thought getting him in the narrow door that should've been the accessible option would be the hard part. He barely fit through, and the molding that went from cement outside to floor inside had a substantial lip. We pushed on with the help of strangers and got him in. That door is NOT ADA compliant. 4) By then the hostess was there, and my companion, told her that we were a party of two for dinner. She seated the family that was there before us, and came back and told us there were no tables and we'd have to wait. We had to get to a movie so we questioned this. The hostess told us she only had booths. I asked if he could sit at the end of one of these, but she said no, he couldn't block the walkways. At this point, I looked into the dining room and saw a plain table just sitting there. I asked ""What about that one?"" She looked at me and said, ""That's a table for 5."" There was no one behind us, no one walking up, no one pulling up in the parking lot. I said ""There's a table we could use right there."" She looked at me condescendingly and said ""It's for 5."" By this point, Ken, in an attempt to get us fed and to our movie, pointed out that one end of the bar had been lowered to accommodate a wheelchair and said we could just eat there. The hostess told us that was for takeout customers and she'd have to talk to her manager.  We thought that would help, but the manager was just as clueless. Ken had already left the desk and was wheeling around looking for options when she came out and told him those open tables were in a closed section.  Were two pizzas brought to a closed section that much of an inconvenience? Was it worth the discriminatory practices, the ill will, and lack of present and future business? This location seems to think so. The fictional party of 5 that may never have come was more important that my wheelchair bound friend and I. By this time, we had spent 15 - 20 minutes trying to reason with these poorly trained young women. We had to give up and move on. They weren't going to serve us, despite having empty tables, and there was nothing we could do. So we left. Sonic got our money instead and they were pleasant about it. I'm still angry at the injustice of it all. At this point I can only hope that California Pizza Kitchen does a better job training its people and making its restaurants more accessible to wheelchair bound people.  They should be ashamed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Alex H.,"Narberth, PA",96,434,94,4.0,12/8/2016,"We stopped in the other day after our meeting with Santa! We were way past our kids dinner time so we quickly ordered food for our 4 year old in addition to our drinks. Our waiter was super fast getting us our drinks and overall he took great care of us the entire visit. Our dinners included the wild mushroom strozzapretti, the BBQ chicken pizza, and a salad for my mom. My 4year old decided on Mac n cheese.  Our waiter brought us the bread which came with olive oil and some herbs, could have used some more there but it was a nice start. After a little wait our waiter told us the kids meal was coming soon but our entrees came out first. We still waited for the kids meal that we ordered more than 10 minutes before the adult entrees. This was the only issue with out dinner, thankfully our 4 year old wasn't feisty but, kids meals gotta come out first!!!  The strozzapretti was delicious but a little small on the portion. The image in the menu looked substantial but the final portion was kinda weak. The BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple (suggested by our waiter) was awesome and my wife loved it. Great pizza dough here! My mom loved her salad but who cares. It's salad.  Not a bad spot to dine if you're in the mall area. I definitely would try more of the pizzas, that is their thing after all but keep in mind it's not attached to the mall so if it's rainy or snowy you'll have to walk through the weather to get to it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Cody Y.,"Havertown, PA",139,720,1122,3.0,4/25/2016,"A pretty average restaurant with a great lunch special, California Pizza Kitchen is always reliable, but there are better pizza places in the area. I'll keep this one quick, as most people are familiar with California Pizza Kitchen. When I think pizza, I think New York or Chicago...not California. As such, the pizza here is just okay, but there is a great lunch combo - Lunch Size Pizza + Soup or Salad/Half Sandwich + Soup or Salad/Soup + Salad for around $10-11. I opted for the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Super Spinach + Quinoa with Granny Smith apples, marinated cranberries and spiced pecans with our housemade vinaigrette. The salad was the best part - the pizza was a little burnt with overcooked ingredients.  Overall, it's an average lunch spot that's a little overpriced other than the lunch special. If you're looking fora a far better yet similar lunch special, From the Boot is a better option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Gladys M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,1,5.0,11/9/2017,"Ok where to start...This was our first time here. While the host forgot about us to the point where I had to ask him why he was by passing us?  Our server was slow and inattentive.. So why did we give it 5 stars?  It was a manager named Jessica. She saw we were about to leave and came right over to us. She not only apologized, she took our order and we were eatting in less than 5 minutes. The food was outstanding.

Darren G.,"Norristown, PA",69,69,10,2.0,8/21/2017,"So the only reason I don't give it one star is the food was actually pretty good, but this complaint is all about service.  If you see the picture I posted on here, they did not bring me silverware with my chicken garlic alfredo, and after 5-10 minutes, I was given plasticware to twirl my pasta.  Really CPK?  Also, it took me 20-25 minutes to get refills on bread and water, and when they did, the water had no ice (then I had to ask for ice, who wants to drink warm water?).  I went and used the bathroom, and the men's room trash can was overflowing and had no paper towels, so no way to dry your hands.  I was very disappointed in my experience here, and the service/cleanliness of the place especially since when I got there it was about 6 PM and there was no wait.  I don't know how you run out of silverware.  I was informed afterwards by management they had plenty of silverware so I guess my waiter was just incompetant or lazy.  Either way, I was not happy about getting plasticware, poor service, and the condition of the restroom.  On the positive end, my wife's avocado egg rolls were good, and my meal tasted pretty good, although it was semi cold by the time I even got my plasticware.  It would have been much more enjoyable if everything was done correctly.  I would say the manager was a nice guy, and even the waiter seemed like a nice kid,  he just didn't know how to do his job.  The fact the food was decent saved them from 1 star, but I am really flabbergasted about the poor service and plasticware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting
Steve S.,"Glenolden, PA",334,945,282,3.0,9/10/2016,"We've become regulars at the Plymouth Meeting Mall lately. This was our dinner choice recently.  It was a roasted garlic chicken pizza for me. It was a thin crust pepperoni for my wife. It was a kids meal cheese pizza for my boy.  They fulfilled my expectations. Those weren't terribly high in the first place I must admit.  Everything was decent enough. But I soon noticed that I liked my wife's pizza better than my own. Thankfully she never finishes hers. Just call me the human garbage can.  Plus, I'd say the wait for the food was longer than I wanted. Granted it was a fairly busy Friday, but not overly so.  It wasn't bad.

Mike M.,"Blue Bell, PA",86,181,51,4.0,7/25/2015,"For those who aren't familiar with CPK in general, they offer a menu of inventive ""pizzas"" (many with atypical toppings and sauces besides tomato), salads, tacos, etc.  The food is fresh and the recipes are somewhat creative, which makes it pretty good as this type of chain goes.  I'm not the biggest fan of their more traditional pizza items (the kinds that come with actual tomato sauce), but I like the Thai Chicken Pizza and the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza (to which I usually add bacon).  The salads are good, if that's your thing.  And, the pork tacos and fish tacos are both better than I would have expected.  Their bar is also above average... There aren't many people sitting there just to drink, but they have a good selection, make drinks well, and have some decent TVs around the area. The Plymouth Meeting location is a pretty nice one.  It's pleasant inside, they keep it nice and clean, and they have a patio with outdoor seating.  The service is excellent.  They're very nice from you're first interaction with a host or hostess through the moment that you walk out the door, and the servers are consistently capable.  Their weak spot is their take out.  They have a pretty convenient take out system, with a dedicated counter that's close to reserved parking spots.  They get take-out orders wrong more often than is really reasonable, though.  To their credit, their managers are models of how to appropriately take care of customers after mistakes, but it shouldn't have to come to that. If you're dining in, this CPK is a pretty safe bet.  For take-out, I would recommend checking your order before you leave. P.S., if you're planning on crossing the parking lot to the movie theater, ask them about their offer for movie tickets.  You can buy vouchers there to save a few dollars on your ticket.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=20

The menu offers a lot of different options from Salads to Pizza to Main Entrees. I've tried almost every appetizer at this point and cannot complain about any of them. Portion sizes are large and items are tasty. Last night I also had the Angel Hair Pasta with Spinach and Asparagus. It was truly delicious. The sauce was light but tasty and the portion left enough for me to have for lunch today. Our server Abby was great. She was very attentive and on point.

I've never been here and had a problem with my meal, I've ALWAYS had super attentive servers, and I've always left full and satisfied. My last visit to this CPK was no exception. I visited on a weekend with my husband after coming from the movies. My only issue was that I couldn't decide between the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and The California Club pizza. I literally took 10 minutes just trying to decide between the two. I asked my server if she had to choose between the two, which one would she choose. So she says ""why choose? Get them both."" She then explained that I could get 1/2 of each on one pizza. That made my entire night!!! Both pizza flavors were so delicious that I may never order a different item at CPK ever again.

We decided to start with the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese, Half Caesar Salad, and the Bianco Flatbread.  I enjoyed the flatbread but the rest was okay.  The salad didn't seem very fresh and the crispy mac 'n' cheese was good but nothing to get excited about.  For our entrees, I had the Fish Tacos w/ Avocado and my girlfriend had the Garlic Cream Fettuccine w/ Sauteed Mushrooms & Chicken.  The chicken in the pasta wasn't good, the mushrooms were good, but the sauce was blandish and not as garlic flavored as expected from the description.  As for my fish tacos, I enjoyed the tacos but they were nothing special.

I'm glad I stopped in as we had a very pleasant experience. I decided not to go for a pizza this time and try something new, so I ordered the grilled chicken chimichurri with grilled veggies. The dish was tasty but that chimichurri sauce definitely had a kick to it, which did wonders for my sinuses! Unfortunately, my mouth was on fire a bit and my waiter didn't refill my water fast enough to my liking. Anytime a customer orders a spicy dish, they should be more on top of the refills.

Secondly, their name is ""pizza kitchen"" so yes, their pizza is pretty good. I wouldn't say it's anything super unique or crazy good because I know some other smaller (non-chain) pizza places do what CPK does and make ""gourmet"" pizzas, but they are pretty decent and worth it because the prices are decent! Another favorite of mine is their flavored iced teas. Nothing special because I think they just pump syrup into fresh iced tea, but it tastes so good!!

We got the BBQ chicken pizza for our main dish, my daughter had the kids cheese pizza.  Noelle suggested the honey wheat crust would compliment the sweetness of the BBQ sauce and she was spot on, it was delicious.  The only part of the meal that was a bit of a disappointment was my flavored iced tea, the flavoring was all at the bottom so it quickly started tasting like regular iced tea, which I like anyway.

Robert K.,"Philadelphia, PA",98,38,16,1.0,1/23/2012,"Based On the recent reviews, I decided to try CPK when the wait at Redstone was too long.  It appeared, again based on the recent reviews, that the restaurant had turned the corner. Boy was I wrong.  In fact, the experience was bad enough that I'm still sitting here waiting for the check and felt compelled to write this.  The restaurant was about half full with plenty of staff standing around talking so one would think that we would be at least somewhat well taken care of. This was not the case at all. We had to wait 20 minutes to have our drink order taken. Our appetizer (fried Mac and cheese) came out cold and the main entrees (pizzas, a BLT and a salad in stages). When we finished our entrees, our waitress came back (mind you she never check on our meal after she brought it) and stated,""you don't want desert do you?"". Really?  My party had eaten our entire meal and to make a decision for us wasn't really very appropriate. We did order desert which ended up being the worst mistake. After taking our order, she left and disappeared for 20 minutes (not an exaggeration) for her to come back and notify us that two of the four items were no longer available. Ok, I get that but it took her 20 minutes to figure that out?  The two that came out shortly thereafter were melted (ice cream based) and one was entirely wrong. We had to actually get up and find our waitress after waiting another 10 minutes to get her to fix the mess up. We're still here 20 minutes later waiting for the check. we were just notified we are waiting to get ""comped"" for the butter cake we couldn't get because they were out. Unbelievable!  No ""I'm sorry"" or ""I apologize for the wait"". Nothing. ARGH!

When server asked how dinner was I asked if he told kitchen no fried toppings. He stated yes, then said WHY? All the time I am picking wontons off salad. Do you want it remade ? WELL , YEAH !!!! Salad comes back yummy. Moms pizza yummy. Then mom wants desert. I order coffee. Comes out tight away, but no spoon. Server can't be flagged down. 10 minutes later I get spoon. Still no key lime pie. 1/2 hour later I tell server drop pie, want check. He states desert will be delivered in s second. 5 minutes later no key lime pie. Check please.  Server says he did the best he could. I comment over 1/2 hour for cold pie unacceptable . As we are leaving g manager appears with pie. Asks. Server which table . I comment probably ours have been waiting 1/2 hour for pie ! She offers to box for takeout but we decline. Box would have been another 15 minutes. My advice- go anywhere else unless you have unlimited time and patience !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=60
Da S.,"Conshohocken, PA",14,175,7,4.0,7/25/2012,"Not sure why the reviews are low on this place.  Never had a bad dining experience.  Take out is dreadfully slow, but all the joints in the Plymouth Meeting Mall complex are the same way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=60
Amber T.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2012,"Found a shard of GLASS IN MY FOOD. It goes without saying neither myself or anyone I care about will ever eat here again. To add insult to injury, they treated it like a joke. I set-up a meeting with one of the manger's but he left. The manager I met with actually laughed while I was filling out the report. NEVER AGAIN will I have anything to do with this place. Really sad and disappointing since I really loved that veggie pizza. But taste does not rule out safety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=60
Jeremy S.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,3,,1.0,7/11/2011,"Run and run fast.  I went with 3 friends. We ordered soup, salad, and pizza. Everything came out at the exact same time and didn't fit on our table. Our waiter apologized and said that the kitchen must have been ""confused."" The margarita pizza was soggy, and the artichoke pizza was just plain gross. The night ended with 1 of our friends throwing up, and the other 3 feeling like they needed to throw up. Good times. Avoid this place at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=60
Jackie R.,"Wayne, PA",6,50,,1.0,3/12/2011,"I've said before that I don't mind paying for good food, but honestly the pizza here isn't good. I'd much rather go to Peace a Pizza or any mom and pop pizza place and save a few bucks in the process. CPK is way overpriced and just isn't quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=60
Sarah T.,"Philadelphia, PA",23,10,5,4.0,8/29/2009,"I've been to many Pizza places and I've got to say, they're one of the best!!! Their thin crust pizza is great! And while they're a bit expensive for my taste- $4 for a soda!, I think their lettuce wraps are better than the ones at P.F. Changs.  A clean restaurant with a nice outdoor seating area, this particular one is a bit on the small size, therefore when it's busy, it's very noisy. But they do have a very good BBQ chicken pizza. Their Pesto Chicken Pizza is one of my favorites. And they used to have a pizza with curried chicken on it that was quite good but they don't have it anymore.  Naturally, their chicken, pasta, and fish dishes aren't that wonderful. It's a Pizza Kitchen, so what do you expect?!?!? Their desserts are nice, I like their Tiramisu and Turtle Sundae.  Cheesecake Factory does have a bigger and better lettuce wrap, but the sauce that comes with the lettuce wrap at CPK is divine! You can order a pint of it for about $5.  Overall, I think they have wonderful pizzas, service, interior, exterior, and lettuce wrap sauce. They are consistently great which is why I will continue to go back. And, I will continue to buy their frozen pizzas at the grocery- they're half the price and almost just as good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=60
Joe F.,"Norristown, PA",0,15,,2.0,12/30/2013,"Food is decent but service is terrible. We waited about 40 minutes until our food came out. Waitress never checked to see if we needed refills, forgot stuff that we asked for. Won't be coming back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=80
Ken P.,"Norristown, PA",1,58,,4.0,7/18/2013,This is my families go to place.  From my 3 year old nephew to my 67 year old dad.  We all agree on two places CPK and Olive Garden and since CPK is only a couple of miles away this is where we come most.  To be fair we really like it all from apps to drinks and even desserts.  The only reason I took one star is that the staff needs to know the menu better.  I always go online and check but when in the restaurant the staff always says something different.  One of the pizzas we like has fish sauce in it so we request another sauce.  We are always to no substitutions and so then I explain about the fish allergy and every time I am assured their is no fish in the sauce.  I then have the staff ask a manager and without fail I am correct and they bend over backwards then to accommodate.  If it was not for that one hiccup they would have gotten a full 5 rating...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=80
Rachel B.,"Dresher, PA",66,348,8,2.0,8/21/2009,"This place is ""just ok.""  I think it used to be better prior to 5 or 6 years ago before it got to be a really big chain.  I feel like they try too hard to come up with inventive pizza and pasta dishes.  Ironically, their original bbq chicken pizza is really still what I like to order.  Their wait time rivals Cheesecake Factory.  Quite frankly, the wait is more worth my while at Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=80
Danielle M.,"Ambler, PA",8,2,,2.0,1/4/2011,"I have gone to this restaurant a few times since it has opened. Originally, I had no qualms with this place. The food was good and interesting enough, and the service was just fine. However, since my first visit, I have been nothing except disgusted and dissatisfied. I am a very patient and forgiving person when it comes to restaurants (seeing as I work in one), that being said, it takes a lot for something to get to me when it comes to dining out. The past two times I have eaten at CPK, I have had slow service. The food did not change (although I did have an unfortunate take-out incident with this place...but that's besides the point), and neither has my seat (in a smaller booth in the middle of the restaurant on the side facing the bar), and surprisingly enough neither has the horrible service. The past two times I have been there it has taken our server over five minutes to greet us. Each time our server looked as if they had just rolled out of bed with out a shower...or even a wash of their hands. They lack character and personality, and make the experience miserable. I do not intend on returning to this restaurant, unless if by some miracle their service improves greatly. The only reason I didn't give this restaurant one star is because the food is consistently OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=80
