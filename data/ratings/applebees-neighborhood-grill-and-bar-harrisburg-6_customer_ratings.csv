23,Amanda W.,"Catasauqua, PA",19,48,5.0,1.0,2012-09-01,"I have to start this review by saying that I've been to quite a few Applebee's over the years. I used to love going here but in the last few years every time I would visit any Applebee's the service and/or food would be horrible, so I stopped going. Last night after traveling from Myrtle Beach SC we stopped in to this location on our way home to the Lehigh Valley. Since this was the only place we could find open at 11pm right off the highway and my boyfriend was complaining because he was starving I decided to give Applebee's one more try. BIG mistake.  We arrived at 11:05pm when they close at midnight. The place had a few customers but it was not crowded at all. While walking to our table I noticed that there was food and paper on the floor. Not a great first sign. I know you're about to close in an hour but since you aren't busy, don't you think someone could sweep the floors? We got to our table and the first thing I did was pick up the drink menu because after that long car ride in traffic I certainly needed one. Every single page of the drink menu stuck together. EWW but ok fine, I dealt with it. Then I looked at the regular menu and really wanted a steak but I didn't think Applebee's was the place for a good steak so both my boyfriend and I ordered sandwiches when our server finally showed up to our table after sitting there for 10 minutes. We ordered and 30 minutes later we still didn't have any food. Our server kept saying that our food should be done soon but it never came, even though everyone else kept getting food. However, we did happen to hear what sounded like dropped plates coming from the kitchen, so it wouldn't surprise me if they dropped our food. In that case though just tell us, that I would have understood. 30+ minutes for sandwiches when you aren't busy I do not understand. The real kicker was when our server came by our table, saw we still didn't have any food and said ""oh shit"" as she went running to the kitchen. That's when I realized she just plain forgot to bring it out to us. This is 40 minutes in now for TWO SANDWICHES!  So when the food came I was absolutely not surprised by what it looked like. First off my plate was scorching hot. I literally burned my hand on it! I asked the server how long it was sitting up there and she said 5 minutes. I called BS on that one. Both my boyfriend and I used to work at restaurants just like this one and we know what food looks and feels like when sitting under a heat lamp for too long so do not try and lie to me with your bull shit 5 minutes. It was sitting there for AT LEAST 20 minutes. The bread was so hard that if I had even tried to bite into it I would not only have a burned hand but also a broken tooth. My boyfriends food was also horrible. He ordered a cheese steak and the cheese wasn't even melted and we could tell it had been put into a microwave. So our server asks if she should get the manager. Well duh! No, I'm just going to eat and pay for this inedible food.  The manager comes over and at first glance she realizes this is disgusting food that should never been brought to us. She said she usually checks all the food before it goes out but she was busy talking to another table. For 30 minutes!? She was very sorry for all of this and offered us more food but after this we were just done, tired, and we wanted to go home. We even told her about our whole trip and all we wanted was some decent food. She really wanted to make it up to us but we just wanted to leave. She took the meals off our check of course but we still had to pay for our drinks. Now I understand paying for mine since it was alcohol and I did drink it, but my boyfriend ordered a coke which he barely drank and which was mostly seltzer. If you really wanted to make it up to us don't you think a free mostly seltzer and not even drunk coke would have been a good start, instead of keeping the almost $3 drink on the bill?? UGH After a while our server finally brings our check and says she will be right back. After waiting another 5 minutes my boyfriend who is also equally as fed up as I am gets up to pay at the bar. The bartender says she can't do it only our server can, as the manager who we just spoke to and knows how upset and tired we are just stands there not offering to help him. REALLY?? Way to care at all! Never in a million years would I consider stopping in at an Applebee's again, not even if you paid me! My boyfriend used to work as a cook and I as a waitress. If he would have cooked food this poorly he would have been fired. If I had been this slow and completely forgot my table and then took food to them like this I too would have been fired. This is completely unacceptable behavior no matter what time of day it is!!! 1 star is too much for this place but I didn't have a choice.  (to the readers of this review, sorry it was so long but as you can see I needed to write a long one to get it all out)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004
27,Sunny Y.,"Springfield, VA",16,11,,3.0,2012-10-15,In PA for a business trip and was craving French Onion soup and their Oriental Chicken salad. Service was slow and the food was decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6?start=20,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005
16,Walter S.,"Hampton, VA",38,168,4.0,3.0,2012-10-31,"We are visiting this area and staying at a nearby hotel. It was a bit past the normal dinner time so when we arrived there was only a light crowd inside. We thought the service would be pretty fast and we were hungry. The guy at the front desk really seemed pretty bored with the whole thing and just showed us to a booth without much comment. Not a bad attitude just sort of ""here we are take it or leave it"" attitude. No problem for me but you would expect better. It turns out the seats in the booths are pretty well aged. Not dirty or torn but really worn out. So much that you feel like you are sitting a few inches too low and on boards. The server in that area was very pleasant, knew about the problem, and told us we would be better at a table. No problem, table was fine and new server was fine also. Two Philly Cheese Steak Sandwiches and Fries. We both opted for ice water. Food preparation was a bit slow but not horrible. Server was pretty attentive the whole time so at least we knew we were not forgotten or invisible. Considering what we ordered and the light crowd it should have been faster. Fries were good. Cheese Steaks had the onion mixed in with the meat instead of layered on top. Couldn't even taste or find the onions but they assured us they were there. The toasted roll was fine but the meat was pretty bland with not much flavor at all. Same with the cheese. Anyway, the fries were great and the server was great. The place could sure use an upgrade. I guess we were lucky and found it pretty clean. Bathrooms were clean and stocked. That is always a plus. Three stars because of the server, fries and clean bathrooms but we are eating elsewhere for the next few nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6,,,,,
26,Ed N.,"New Cumberland, PA",0,1,,3.0,2013-08-10,"The food was what I expected, except we had to send a steak back twice because it wasn't cooked enough for anyone to eat. After the second time, the manager took that meal off the bill which was really nice.

22,Brandon D.,"Abbottstown, PA",7,16,1.0,5.0,2014-03-28,"Very fast service and the food came out ridiculously quick. Hostess wasn't that friendly but not ride either. All in all, good place for food.

14,Dwayne F.,"Jamesburg, NJ",8,151,411.0,3.0,2014-04-16,"There were 7 in our group.  Went for dinner on Sunday after leaving another crowded popular restaurant just up the street, that couldnt seat us.  The service was good.    Walked in the door and seated right away.  Server was good.   Service was just right- not too long waiting.   We sent back one steak because it wasnt well done.  My food tasted good and no one else in the group had any complaints. Other than that, an overall good experience for all of us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6,,,,,
19,Harry K.,"New York, NY",4,21,17.0,4.0,2014-04-22,"All in all, not bad.  We started with the appetizer sampler.  A really generous portion of boneless hot wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken quesadillas and spinach/artichoke dip.  I had the chicken broccoli alfredo pasta which was a bit disappointing.  Really small portion with only 4-5 small pieces of chicken.  The plate was humongous, but unfortunately I can't eat the plate.  My wife had some steak and shrimp dinner and it looked pretty good.  I did get to taste the steak and it was cooked well and had decent seasoning.  Our son's dinner was complimentary as long as it was ordered from the kids menu.  Our waiter was very nice.  Applebee's has much improved since my last visit many many years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6,,,,,
24,Melissa Z.,"Clifton, NJ",0,25,,1.0,2014-08-23,"We started our awful meal off with ""spicy"" nachos. How can you mess up nachos right? They must have dumped an entire salt shaker onto the chips and it lacked cheese and the ""spicy"" part was just jalapeños and some BBQ sauce. It was disgusting. Our entree was a chicken fajita wrap and chicken fajitas. Gross, I don't even know how to describe the lamp cooked wrap, with it's microwaved melted cheese. We ordered 22 oz beers to drink away our regret from eating at this establishments and were greeted with flat Stella's. Avoid avoid avoid I rather have paid to go back and cook my own meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6?start=20,,,,,
13,Margarette N.,"Atlanta, GA",172,204,165.0,2.0,2014-09-13,"Chains start at 3 stars for me. The one star loss comes on the 10 minute wait between us being seated and a waiter coming to get drink orders, and the very sad presentation on my mom's dish.  I ordered the thai shrimp salad, which was actually pretty good. The dressing is a little spicy, had decent flavor, but was applied to liberally.  My mom got a salmon entree, that looked so pathetic on those weird outdated muted green dishes they use. Bleh, not appetizing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6,,,,,
8,Amy G.,"Hampden, PA",122,387,25.0,2.0,2014-10-03,"OK. First off, let me say I have become a huge fan of the Applebee's lunch special. Two columns, pick two, three prices.  I haven't gotten anything from either column that I didn't like. I'm not a  huge fan of this type of chain, but I really like their lunches. That said, I stopped in with a coworker between meetings.  We arrived around 1:00.  I had a 2:00 meeting. I figured there would be plenty of time.  We were seated quickly.  Our drinks arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Our server was nice. Then the wait started. 1:10 passed.  Still no food.  1:20 passed. Still no food.  Server said it would be out soon. 1:30 passed. I was starving and starting to feel woozy.  1:40 arrived. Still no food.  I started complaining and told them it was ridiculous. Food finally arrived at about 1:45.  When we arrived, I told the server I had a 2:00 meeting. Over the approximately 45 minutes it took to get food, I must have told her several times I had a meeting. I was disappointed that she didn't ask if I wanted to get my food to go or to even offer me a box. I ate as much as I could.  Had to wait for a box. The manager did apologize and give us a $10.00 discount.  My friend had pasta and salad.  I had a half sandwich and pasta. Both of which should have taken about 10 to prepare.  I would have perhaps been a little more understanding if every table was taken and the place was busting at the seams.  The place was maybe 25% full and some wait staff were hanging around like they had nothing to do. Miserable, miserable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6,,,,,
17,Amber D.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,2,2.0,1.0,2014-12-20,"Awful experience. Took 20 mins for the appetizer to arrive and an hour for our meals, which by the way only included a sandwich with fries and a burger with fries, items that should take only 10 mins to cook. Applebees didn't offer to remedy the situation. Just a ""Sorry for your wait."" The manager didn't even stop by to apologize. It's a little frustrating when you watch three other parties arrive, receive their meals and leave all before your meal arrives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-harrisburg-6,,,,,
15,Andy J.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,11,,1.0,2015-01-19,Horrible service staff was very slow with refill of drinks and removing dishes from tables.  Seemed to me servers were more interested in conversation with each other than paying attention to guest.  My steak I ordered was so over seasoned I couldn't eat it.

Nobody was in there and the place seemed kinda gross? The waiter we had was nice but definitely needs to clean up. There wasn't a bar tender on shift so our waiter made us gross margaritas. I wouldn't go back. What kind of burger only comes medium well or well done? It seems like the staff is operating in slow motion.

Then finally they took the effort to go and use my card  and that took another 15 minutes.
