What makes the difference is the service and atmosphere and this location receives a great rating from me. Football fan wise-I bleed purple while my friend is a Steelers fan (no accounting for taste, I know). So, with last Sunday being the first time of the season where Steelers & Ravens both had games at 1pm, it was imperative that we both had the ability to watch our respective football games.  We walked in and the gates of football game heaven opened up. The bar had FIVE flat screens surrounding the bar perimeter AND a big projector screen in the middle of the bar section. Score and DOUBLE Score! I tried to work my charm on Lisa the bartendress to see if we could switch the Ravens game to the big screen but unfortunately the store manager was a Skins fan so that game got projector and sound system priority. No biggie. Customer service was excellent. Lisa was engaging and when I sent my dish back due to slightly translucent shrimp, a pleasant elderly lady with a beehive doo came out to apologize and asked if everything was okay with the redo. I assumed she was the grill master because I saw her bringing out all the skillet dishes. When our next trip to Hollywood casino falls on a Saturday into football Sunday, we plan to come back here to watch all the games at this sports bar like Applebee's. By the way, it's located just a few short minutes away from the casino.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-charlestown,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096

We could see why the apps were half off because I don't think people would pay $24 for an app. Other than that the food was average chain-style food, the service was fair, this Applebee's is much better than there Martinsburg location.

Walked in and immediately did a double take, English speaking friendly employees? No way, I thought, I must have missed something. Nope sure didn't, staff was amazing right from the start. So nice to be greeted in plain English with a smile. No other area applebees has that bragging right. Food was better than the other locations I've tried, service was by far the best, staff must be from another planet, I've simply never had that kind of service in an applebees, they were phenomenal.

Let's start with the service- we waited at a empty host station waiting to be seated for about 2 minutes. 2 minutes isn't that long but during dinner time...to leave the host station unattended, come on management.  As for the food, everything came out burnt and steak came out medium rare when we asked for medium well.  I know the cooks didn't graduate from CIA but how do you mess that one up? Servers?  If you dislike your job that much, find another one, it's so obvious you would rather be elsewhere.  Please, my food tastes so much better if you weren't scowling every time you came by reluctantly to ask how our food was...

I did not cause a scene but just told my server and explained all i wanted was a fresh one, which she brought out about 20 minutes later and not one visit from the manager or any offer to comp anything. I didn't really mind paying full price but someone other than my server should have paid a visit to our table.

The overall experience was great, thanks to the friendly bartender. She provided expectational service and never once strayed from quality service.  Half way through my meal, three gentlemen were trying to do some attempting to split the ticket in a very complicated way, she did as they stated and when they got the bill, they began to argue that she screwed it up and that she was at fault, she apologizes and walked them through their request and redid the bill.  AMAZING!! Normally nowadays, servers just argue and take a defensive stance (which she has every right too; however, decided the smoother approach).   When people around us food started to come out before us, she apologized and went to the back to see why our order was taking longer than the others.  A few minutes followed and out came the food.  I ordered the 'All-Day Brunch Burger' As it sat in front of me I was disappointed at its appearance and quickly suspected that it would be subpar.  Nonetheless, to my surprise, it was a perfect blend of cheese, meat, hash brown taste.   A colleague of mine, ordered a sirloin with mashed potatoes and he expressed the same thoughts, appearance wise not appealing and worrisome, however, filled with flavor and very tender according to him.
