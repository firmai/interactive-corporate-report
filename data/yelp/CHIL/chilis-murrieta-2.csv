Jessica H.,"Riverside, CA",127,44,25,3.0,8/12/2017,"We decided to go to one of our favorite places (chillis) on a Friday night. It was very busy, so our wait was about 20 minutes.  The staff was friendly, but we didn't get a refill the entire time we were there, I understand it was busy but come on now.  The food was good as always, no complaints. I had the honey chipotle ribs, they were very tender and so good, along with the French fries that are always great.  My husband had the loaded chicken bites, he wasn't a fan of the white sauce that was on them.  And of course we had the Texas cheese fries as an appetizer and they were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2
Jose G.,"Murrieta, CA",376,574,1354,5.0,3/4/2017,"My first time at Chili's was here and it was surprisingly great!  Wifey and I came here on a Sunday after a quick Target run and everything we ordered was fantastic! My margarita was tasty, chips and guacamole were fresh, and the margarita chicken and cajun chicken pasta we ordered was definitely on point.  I would recommend coming early because this place gets swamped right at dinner time. I just came here again two weeks ago and got the same waiter and great service.  Move over TGI Friday's, Chii's is now the best spot for a happy hour on Sunday in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2

In addition, he reflected a positive attitude. We will return to our Murrieta 'Chili's"", thanks to Paul. BTW, Paul works the weekends.  I failed to mention the food was very good, cooked to our liking.  Fair prices compared to most other sit-down restaurants.

Rihana A.,"Compton, CA",41,70,69,4.0,9/4/2017,Went for Happy Hour with a friend. I am pleased to see that the happy hour menu has been recreated. They now have drink and food specials worth ordering. The wings were delicious. The flatbread was average. Of course I had to order chips and salsa. Overall I was pleased and will return.

Hayley L.,"Wildomar, CA",116,17,,5.0,11/26/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. The staff is always friendly, the restaurant is always clean, and the environment is so family friendly. I visit this location at least once a week and no matter if I do a to-go order or sit inside it's great quality food with an awesome customer service experience. I've visited the #1 chili's that's located in Montclair and I can honestly say that they had nothing on this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2
Jen E.,"Wildomar, CA",178,192,36,1.0,1/10/2017,"We came to the Murrieta Chili's last night to eat dinner for my niece's 14th birthday. I usually would rather eat anywhere than most chains, but it was her birthday & what she wanted.   Last night's visit was one of a kind. I have never in my life experienced a ruder server than I did last night with Heather.  We were a group of 13 with a few kids included in that. We were seated by the hostess and then Heather came over to greet us and take our drink order. We ordered 2 lemon-aids for our kids (ages 6 & 8). When Heather brought our kids drinks, they were in adult cups. I asked her why they weren't in kids cups and her reply was ""Big kids usually drink the small cups pretty fast, and I don't have time for all those refills"" This alone shocked me, but trying to be understanding we went with it.  We then waited an hour for our food. I know this happens with bigger parties as I had been a server for many years. But, when our food finally came my boyfriends Smothered chicken burrito came out ice cold. It had obviously been sitting a long time. We let Heather know it was cold, and she offered to warm it up in the microwave. This is not okay. When Heather came back to the table she offered a new burrito, but as togo I told her we would like a warm one for here. We didn't go out to eat to have a microwave burrito or warm food packed in a togo box.  We tried to flag the manager down but she was running around like a chicken with her hear cut off, never making eye contact with any customers and never came to our table.  We paid & left. Likely, we will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2

All the good stuff, burgers, ribs, crispers, new appetizers and chicken and waffles.  Got rid of some of those Tex mex items. It was getting to bee too much Tex mex and less hamburgers etc.  they kept the fajitas. They looked great too. My husband got the chicken and waffles. He was happily surprised. They were sweet and spicy plus he had half left over for lunch the next day. I got the guacamole burger minus the bun and fries and add salad. It was perfect.  Oh our server Cody was awesome.

Gloria B.,"Murrieta, CA",4,59,73,4.0,9/11/2017,"We like Chili's but wish it was spelled correctly with an ""e"" at the end, in Spanish. Our faves are the agave margarita, mixed to perfection and accompanied with the steel shaker on the side. So it's like getting 2 of them. The dry rub ribs are always crispy on the outside, moist inside without all the sugar in a sauce and sticky fingers. Just our preference. Mango chicken dinner is satisfying, love their quesadillas and quesadilla salad is great. Don't order the pre-fixed guacamole as it has too much lime to keep it from turning dark, which overwhelms the avocado flavor. Next time we will try the hand made one at the table so we can control how much lime goes into it. Everything we've had has been good for a chain restaurant. You can call ahead for a place in line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2

Natane B.,"Temecula, CA",6,3,,3.0,8/10/2017,Honestly the only reason for my review is due to the poor staff and crap food. I ordered a steak but the sides we're terrible the asparagus wasn't cooked and the potatoes were smothered in bacon and chives.  Also waitress was very rushed and was no where near to be found to order a dessert so we left instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2
P M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/24/2017,"One of the worst customer service experiences at a restaurant ever!  I have been to this location before and was very disappointed but I thought I would give it another try.  It was about 4:10 pm and the place was pretty much empty, maybe 5 or 10 people in the whole restaurant.  Almost every table was available.  I waited for someone to acknowledge us and eventually a hostess came by and ask how many (2) and she said she would be right back.  I waited, and waited, and waited but she was nowhere in sight.  In the meantime, numerous servers walked by and didn't even acknowledge me, or ask if I was being helped.  I finally saw the hostess chatting with one of the servers but she was in no rush to get back to me.  I was just about to leave when the hostess returned just as I was ready to leave.  I was pretty upset so far about the service but decided to just relax and enjoy my meal.  After being seated and reviewing the menu we waited for a server to take our order because there were so many around, but no such luck.  A few people came in and so now there were 3 tables in the entire area with customers.  The people that came after me were greeted by their server and again I was becoming frustrated.  Finally a server came by and took our drink order and said she would be right back.  By now we have been there for a 1/2 hour, at 4:40 pm and the place was still pretty much empty.  We waited and waited and after seeing our server having a conversation with a few guys, then leaning over to kiss him, I was seething.  Oh no, wait.. it gets better.  Then she sat down with them.  I was done, shocked that a owner or manager would allow this type of service.  Maybe they didn't care about one customer, maybe they lost a lot more. I have had amazing service and food at other Chili's locations. No wonder their parking lot is always empty.  You don't see that at any other location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2

I took my daughters here after the movies and the kids were given crayons and coloring paper to keep quiet. It helped me decide what I want to order.  I got the fatijas bowl with a fresco salad and my kids got the pizza and grilled chicken burgers with broccoli. I've been to many Chili's, but this was nice that I can now pay right at my table with the little machine on the table.

However the services Chili's murrieta are horrible from the lazy hosting and the poor bussing. The vary slow service was not helpful either. We sat down to we order our food at the same time as our drinks almost an hour later our food came out. Now I am not one to write a bad review I am a business owner I know how important reviews are.

Christa L.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",706,329,904,2.0,1/2/2017,"OMG...why is it that I always have bad experiences at Chili's? And why do I continue to return? Well, this time, it was because it was Christmas Eve, it was the only restaurant near the theater we were going to attend, and we didn't feel like dealing with crowds and traffic.  So, as I said, it's Christmas Eve and I get that it's going to be crowded...HOWEVER, waiting for our food for 50 minutes is unacceptable.  Especially when the table who sat down seconds before us, with a larger group, had already received their food and were putting their leftovers in to-go boxes before we even received our food. In addition to that, two of the four meals we ordered were delivered luke warm.  Ugh...the two stars are for the fact that our poor server was really trying and I don't believe it was her fault and the food that I tasted was actually decent.  Won't ever return though...and hopefully I will remember the prior experiences I have had the next time somebody suggests Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=20

Ashley H.,"Denver, CO",8,45,18,1.0,3/21/2017,We typically go to this Chili's atleast once a month and have always enjoyed our experience there. But last night was just ridiculous. We love our dog and take her everywhere with us. When we go to dinner if we want to bring her we make sure to go to a PET FRIENDLY restaurant and sit OUTSIDE on the patio. So we are sitting at the bar in Chili's and all of a sudden we hear something that sounds like a dog scratching its collar. And what do you know; some lady has her toy poodle sitting on the booth chair at their table INSIDE. Last time I checked Chili's wasn't pet friendly. And no it was not a service dog; it had a pink harness and a flexi leash. Extremely disgusting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=20

Kernel S.,"Murrieta, CA",2,50,11,2.0,6/25/2016,"So, Starbucks is being sued for not serving the oz. as advertised; shorting drinks on quantity!  Well, this place does the same thing. Ordered a beer, went to the restroom to wash my hands after work, came back and my beer looked like someone had taken a big swig from it.  I 'tounge-in-cheek' asked the bartender if she was drinking my beer.   Her response was serious though, ""I can't fill it because I'm not allowed to.""  ""We can only fill it  till the head hits the top of the glass."" So, when I came back from washing my hands, the head had settled to the point that it looked like several oz. were missing.  Really?  And you won't give me what you advertise (16oz beer) or even appease an inquisitive customer.  Not going back.  It had been years since I'd been in this location anyway and after all that time, this was my 'comeback' experience.  I won't miss it. This chain is going the way of TGI Friday's.  Two franchises with an old business model and older facilities.

He gave me military discount a whole $3.00 off my purchase of $44 Oh boy after waiting 15 min for him to run my card he comes and brings my check back with no pen(place wasn't busy at all).

Serrano S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",3,46,75,1.0,5/19/2017,"My birthday dinner ruined! I saved a place in line for our fam of 6 via app. We checked in. We're told it would be another 15-20 minutes. They sat a few parties ahead of us while we were there (parties of 4 and 5) they finally called us... showed us a table in the middle surrounded by everyone (I have a 4 yr old) we automatically said NO. We seen another table (people had just walked out, table was dirty) told them we wanted that one. Manager walked over and told us he'd clean it right up for us right away... They made us wait by waiting area again(we thought hat was odd) we were waiting awhile... they then call a party of 2, then another party of 6. That fam of 6 also didn't want the table we first got offered, then we see them automatically sit them down on the table we were waiting for to be cleaned! (It was clean now) None of the staff including the manager  acknowledged us! It took for my husband to ask what the hell happened to our table. The two employees were speechless. I asked to speak to the manager, that told us he'd have THAT table cleaned for US!! they paged him, he came right over, and swore up and down that the fam was ahead of us! And if they weren't that table would of been ours!! Uuummmmm NO...That was a lie! They were caucasian and we are chicanos (in a restaurant full of Caucasians) we felt discriminated, that family basically wanted that table(that we were waiting patiently for them to clean) and they got it no IFS AND OR BUTS!! we were left waiting like idiots for them to clean a table... then lie that the other family was ahead of us! Let me say something... if that family was ahead of us... they would of gotten called BEFORE US... we were waiting for over 30 minutes! That family sat down to wait right after another party got called to be seated... they had been sitting there the entire time until they called them AFTER THEY CALLED US...

Chelsea J.,"Alpine, CA",51,4,1,1.0,2/8/2017,"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First of all, our server Veronica was impatient when taking our orders (we were only a group of 4). Halfway through my meal, I decided I wanted to order the fried asparagus. Took about 10 minutes to get it but when I got it I realized there was a long black hair on my asparagus! We mentioned it to Veronica and she took it back. She came back a few minutes later to say that it wasn't any of the staffs hair because ""it was actually blonde"". Um no my entire group saw that it was a black hair, not blonde!! Then she proceeded to argue with us and accuse us of putting a blonde hair in my own food. Why would I go out of my way to put hair in my food and have to wait another 10 minutes for a new order?! I didn't even want the asparagus off my bill, I just wanted a new one, not trying to eat someone's hair. I then told her she was rude and she lost her tip and she said ""I wasn't counting on it anyway"". Just because I'm young (21) doesn't mean I don't tip well. I told her I wanted to speak to the manager and wanted a new server. The manager Silvia was very nice and understanding and I got a new order of asparagus but I'm still very annoyed with the experience and after being accused of putting hair in my food, dealing with an extremely rude and unprofessional server, and having to wait again for a new order of asparagus, the LEAST they could've done was take it off my bill, even though that wasn't my original intention.

The service was great last night, our waitress was awesome. The food was delicious. But there was just 1 problem. We were out on a double date with our best friends when we came here. We we were seated promptly and well taken care of. Our waitress was great, she made sure we had plenty of drinks and chips.  We ordered the panko onion rings to start out and chips and guacamole. Both delicious. For our appetizer I got the bacon burger and everyone else got Chipotle honey wings. It was delicious.  For dessert we had lava cakes which were awesome.  You may be asking what the problem is... Well, I ended up with food poisoning and have been up all night and I'm still sick. I don't know what caused it or if anyone else in our party has it, I hope not. But it is the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 because I don't want anyone else to get sick.

Walking in....There was only one waiter taking care of the busy bar area.  He was running around trying to take care of at least 10 tables. There were 4 tables that were not cleaned up and no busboy around.  Looking around the dining area, we saw a number of tables that were not cleaned also.  The place looked dirty all over.   We were told it would be about 20 minutes, during that time we saw only 2 waitresses taking care of the dining room.  They were working hard and doing the best they could.   In our experience, it is usually poor management that causes the downfall.  We could tell that this was the case because we never saw the manager out in the dining area or the bar area.

But that wouldn't make much of a review so . . .  To me, the food here reminds me in some ways of pub food, but with a much bigger variety. They have a southwest egg roll that I could eat along with my margaritas, but I'd never be able to stop either one and end up as an obese drunk. I also like their flatbreads.

While we were enjoying our conversation and drinks, had not ordered yet, the Hostess comes to our table and start asking for donations for a charity. I find this completely inappropriate. They already have an app in there table pay kiosk that asks for those donations when you pay the check.

You got an appetizer, two meals, two presidente margaritas and a dessert. We had the bottomless chips and salsa, the chicken fajitas and the toffee brownie sundae. The fajitas are good here.

She was so sweet and felt bad, she took some money off the bill on her own behalf.  A very conscientious lady!

David L.,"Wildomar, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/20/2017,"If you go to this restaurant, be sure to get an itemized receipt showing the individual meals and drinks they say you bought, before you pay for anything. I went with two other family members and we each ordered modestly-priced meals and no drinks. At the end of the meal when the amount we owed was displayed on the table-top electronic device, it was higher than I thought it should be. But the only amount the device would display and print was the total amount; it didn't list the individual meals we were being billed for. I asked the waitress for a menu and an itemized bill, and she brought me both. The itemized bill (which she had to go get from someplace other than the table-top device) listed a 4th meal that we had not ordered and had never been brought to our table. I pointed that out to the waitress and she took that meal off the bill, claiming some other server must have somehow gotten on to her account and put that 4th meal on. If I hadn't done some math in my head before the bill came, I never would have discovered the overcharge.

I am not picky, but when you're sitting 10-15 minutes without being greeted, asked if you'd like a drink, then SOMETHING IS WRONG. It was not overly-busy and ALL THREE TIMES we had to wait for someone to even acknowledge us sitting. Now the cooks here, TERRIBLE. I always get chips and salsa...the first time the salsa was SO WATERED DOWN it wouldn't even stay on a chip. This last time we went she gave us barely any salsa, and all the chips she gave us were BROKEN like literally crumbs of chips. I let it go and didn't say anything. Then when our food FINALLY comes out, I ordered the LOADED boneless wings. I always get these at the Chili's in Corona, and they are BOMB with lots of queso cheese and tons of shredded melted cheese on top. These wings were NOT loaded, they were hard, with barely any cheese on top, looked like how the wings should look after a couple days of sitting in the fridge. All three times I have come the wings have been this way. I should have known not to order them again. This place needs some serious NEW MANAGEMENT, NEW COOKS, and ATTENTIVE SERVERS.

When we were seated it was about 10 min before someone even acknowledged our existence.  A waiter from another section came by to take our drink order and told us that our server would be by soon.  Another 10 min went buy before that happened.  We ordered and didn't see our waitress again until our food was brought out. We ordered the pretzel stick appetizer.  I know that it is becoming standard practice for these types of chains to have frozen appetizers, but its getting a little out of hand.  The pretzels and cheese were acceptable, just shy of ok, and far from good.  I ordered a bacon ranch quesadilla.  I would have been better off at taco bell it probably would have been less greasy.  The quesadilla itself was void of any sort of flavor.  The only thing that had flavor was the pepper ranch and it was still weak.  My wife's fajitas were undercooked and almost cold when they came to the table. Our waitress was absolutely horrible.  I can take bad food or poor service, but not both.  we weren't given any napkins or place settings when our appetizers were brought out.  When we requested them, they were thrown at us as the waitress hurried past our table.  When our entrees came, they too were thrown at us.  When the waitress brought refill for our drink, she put enough force into it, so that the one drink slid halfway across the table to collide with the previous one.

She came to check up on us a few times and was good. Nothing on her. The food on the other hand was bleh... My husband ordered a burger and he said it was good. I ordered the an entree dish with a beef taco, tostada, rice, beans, and enchilada, and it was bleh. The flavor was bland and all I could taste was the cumin.

It seems like there's something missing. Overall, I wouldn't want to come back again. Not for the food anyway. The service was good. Greeted at the door and was attentive checking up on us.

I was in town for a friend of my BFs wedding and while the boys were out for the the bachelor business the ladies went over to Chili's for a few drinks the night before the rehearsal brunch- that's right: BRUNCH. Meaning we have to be up early for brunch and earlier for the rehearsal so nothing too crazy, at least not tonight, or yet. I didn't eat anything so take this for what it's worth. Just a drinking experience for me this go 'round, but they had 23 oz mugs of Stone IPA for $5. So, that was nice.  The bartender was v. young looking but maybe it's just the California living that keeps ya youthful.

Things started off rather well and I decided to order myself the triple dipper appetizer. After waiting for about twenty five minutes I spoke with our waiter asking what was going on with my request, immediately the look on his face was ""oh shit"". He had forgotten to put in my order. So after avoiding my table to dodge further questioning by myself, I sat impatiently waiting not only for my food but also to order another drink as mine had been sitting empty for about ten minutes. It finally came out, 45 minutes later. When it was time to pay for the bill I could not just sit there without expressing my feelings towards the staff. I mentioned my predicament to the bartender and immediately he gave me attitude as if I was in the wrong. He requested the manager and she made me wait fifteen minutes before coming to speak with me. Finally she came up to me and instead of welcoming me with a positive attitude I was given the look of someone who felt bothered. It was as if I had been deemed a complete burden and that me informing her about my poor service was a nuisance to her. She told me she would ""see what she could do"". After waiting yet another ten minutes, she returned stating that she will take five dollars off my fifty dollar tab. Needless to say I will never be returning to chili's again! I was not even given an apology for their error just more and more attitude by employees. This establishment is by no means professional in any way shape or form.

First, let me state that their re-decorating looked amazing! I really had high hopes (as I hadn't been here since Nov 2011)! Their modern style was refreshing compared to their original dungy look. The hostess sat us (my 11 year old son and I) immediately and announced who our server would be. Brandy soon arrived at our table and introduced herself. She was very nice and polite and attentive. She took our drink orders and came back promptly with them. We needed a little extra time to look over the menu so she left us for a few minutes. My son and I decided to try their ""2 for $20"" deal. Seemed like a sure thing. We decided on the chips and fire-roasted corn guacamole as our shared appetizer. Good choice! The guac was flavorful and we also had salsa too! Great start! So our entrees came out and they looked amazing! Our food was so hot and fresh! I ordered their Classic Bacon Burger with a side of the fries. I also asked for a side of ranch (for my fries). My son ordered the 6oz. sirloin with steamed broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes. My entree selection: The burger was cooked perfectly! The bacon was a bit overcooked for my liking but not ""horrible"". The burger did seem to have an ""abundance"" of shredded lettuce - a bit too much, in my opinion. Overall though, the burger was good. My fries though - not so great. They were piping hot but overly salty. They were fried to a perfect crispness - but the seasoning was overpowering. Eh...Oh yeah, my side of ranch was forgotten - so I had to remind our server. My son's entree selection: He steak was grilled perfectly as ordered (medium well). My son was raving about his steak! So much that he begged me to have a bite! So of course I did! Whoa! Salt City, USA! That steak had so much salt - I don't understand how my son could eat it! The steamed broccoli was flavorful - but over seasoned with pepper. The loaded mashed potatoes were just average, at best. They were piping hot but seemed 'old' (as if they had been sitting in a steamtable pan for several hours). The service was acceptable. The server continued to refill our drink selections (my son ordered the strawberry lemonade; I ordered the blackberry iced tea) throughout our meal. I noticed several other servers and hotesses walking about the restaurant and all of them seemed genuinely happy. Smiles and warm welcomes greeted every guest! Can't have too high of expectations from a chain restaurant; I expected to give at least three stars but the food drove the rating down to two stars.

Julie G.,"Wildomar, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/14/2011,"My husband and I have ""date night"" every Friday night, and this is a hot spot for us! We love the food, and the service...some of the waiters and waitresses know us by name, and us them! Very occasionally the service blows, but more times than not, it's great!!! We get our food hot, and fast, our drinks usually never go dry, and we always get a little extra courtesy from them with our chips and salsa (yes I know they're unlimited, but we always get a refill right before we leave and take the rest home). If you aren't watching your caloric intake, you have to try their Cajun Chicken Pasta, it's crazy delicious and really well priced...speaking of price, that's another GREAT thing about Chili's, they always have such GREAT deals!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=140
Jade F.,"Sun City, CA",76,36,1,1.0,2/21/2014,"Worst service I have ever received. First people who checked in after us with the exact same number in the party got seated before us, next the waitress got our drink order wrong twice when all it was, was all water & one soda, then we had ordered a 2 for 20 deal and on our appetizer we got chips and guacamole, the waitress asked us if we wanted a refill on our chips & guacamole, but then brought us chips & salsa we politely said we had guacamole not salsa, and she said oh there is no refills on guacamole, which is fine but why did she specifically say would you like more chips and guacamole? Then she said well let me get our manager, at this point we were still being nice just explaining our issue, the manager then said no one refills guacamole here and if they do they'll be fired, I thought he was being a little extreme by saying that. So we then said let us just pay for our salads and don't worry about bringing the rest of our food out. He then gave us a very dirty look. And was rude as we left. I work in retail and I would never be rude to customers or down grade another employee in front if customers. My mom has also been a waitress her whole career life, and I know how customers should be treated. Just a bad experience. I won't be back there. I have also heard a lot of other complaints from other people about this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=140

Ever since new mgmt took over a few months ago, the place became a weird place to visit with palpable tension in the air.

Mariya C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,27,5,1.0,3/8/2011,"My mom and i went for lunch today and the service sucked! I think our server had too many tables or maybe she hates her job! I had the chicken enchilada soup and this time it was nasty so i wanted to give it to my mom so it wouldn't go to waste maybe she would like it! I had to wait forever and flag her down for a spoon she never brought, it felt like we waited 30 mins at least for our food and our server never came to check on us, i had to ask a manager for my check and he didn't even bother to ask if everything was ok, he looked like he was confused. After she made time to bring my credit card back with the receipt so she could say thank you just to get a tip even though she was rude and didn't deserve it, i looked at her and said ""i never did get that spoon"" as shes looking at a full bowl of soup she says ""o yah, so what was wrong with the spoon u had"" did she really said that, and then she asked if i wanted her to put the nasty cold soup in a to go..Really..WTH..I know its not an upscale place but if u hate your job find another one. I could have saved my $30 and had better luck at taco bell..never did see a smile, don't worry i didn't tip her!! BEWARE..Long straight brown hair in a ponytail with blond highlights in a ponytail...I would have complained on the chilis website but i was so pissed i left my receipt on the table",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=140
Amanda R.,"Murrieta, CA",351,108,57,2.0,10/4/2010,"Came here very hung-over on a Sunday afternoon. As football season had started our first dining choice (BWW) was packed so we came here instead. We found the bar area relatively empty and after eating here we figured out why. Our server had maybe 3 tables she was responsible for, so I know she was overwhelmed by any means. I ordered the premium bloody mary and carefully watched the bartender to see if he in fact was going to make it with Grey Goose as the menu specified. He did not. Instead he used Absolut, which wouldn't be a big deal except that GG is much better and if I am paying for it then that is what I expect to get. I walked up o the bar and he informed me that the premium was made with Absolut and after I told him what the menu said he remade it. We ordered salads and an assortment of appetizers for our meal since they had happy hour specials. Our food arrived, but no salads. I know they eat salad after the meal in other countries, but considering that I was in Murrieta, I was a little pissed. The manager had already come by to address the cocktail issue and after I asked about the salads he came over again. I asked if the waitress was new, which would be an ok reason why our salads had not come yet and was told that she wasn't. I told him I didn't want to get her in trouble, but considering how empty the place was they really couldn't afford bad service. He agreed and comped our entire meal. While free food should taste pretty damn good, this food was blah. Even hung over (when almost anything tastes good) I was not very impressed. I guess this is a good place to come watch Sunday football (since it is empty), but I won't be ordering any food here that is for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=140
Vikki C.,"Murrieta, CA",181,102,37,4.0,4/28/2008,"This branch of the ""Chili's"" chain is great! I used to hate Chili's a few years back, but I firmly believe they have made a come-back! They all kinds of delicious things on the menu. Our waiter (Nick) was so attentive, even on a busy night. I crave their new smokehouse bacon. It has a touch of brown sugar and a touch of spice. I love it! They would have gotten the full 5 stars from me but the service waivers a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=140
Laura S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/2/2010,"The best, so much to choose from. You get an appetizer like chips & salsa or southwestern egg rolls and an entree like bbq chicken salad or mini taco's (love the chicken)or ribs just to name a few.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=140
