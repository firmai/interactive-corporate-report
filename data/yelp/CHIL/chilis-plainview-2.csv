Trenton V.,"Cordova, AK",42,172,4,4.0,8/23/2015,"I sat at the bar, ordered table side guacamole and a couple blue moons. Two servers seemed very busy with the entire bar area, probably around 7-8 customers for each. Despite this, they did a very good job staying on top of things. The lack of a star is due to the chips. Way too much salt Chilis! It's like a coating of salt for each chip. Plus they're the most greasy chips you'll find anywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Rocko J.,"Fort Myers, FL",26,22,2,1.0,6/4/2017,This placed sucked. No service no table tables still Dirty. Appalling for a chilis. Never recommend to anyone,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Mark B.,"Austin, TX",78,8,1,1.0,8/10/2017,Avoid this poorly managed chili's. extremely slow service. We orders 7 sandwiches to go and if took them over 40 minutes to make. The place is falling apart.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Tara B.,"Lubbock, TX",74,247,131,3.0,8/2/2016,"This is ok as far as Chili' goes. Not great, but ok. It took a while to get our food out, but in this case it was ok because we were catching up with a dear friend we hadn't seen in a long time. The food wasn't super hot, but warm. I was starving so I just ate it. We didn't get refills as often as I would have liked, but at least she came and checked on us. Would I come back? Yes, I guess so, because it really is the only restaurant like this without going to Lubbock or Amarillo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Jose D.,"Irving, TX",28,2,,5.0,3/5/2017,"I had an amazing experience her at chilis with my parents, Jesica made the experience worth while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Cody B.,"Hale Center, TX",15,14,,3.0,6/18/2016,"Good food, poor service. Waitress filled our glasses once, and let the sit empty the rest of the meal. Then they want to fill out the survey on the tablet for you and give all perfect scores to themselves, or fill it out after you leave the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
David F.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,9,,5.0,4/21/2015,Excellent choice of food. I like their new menu.  Service was great. I ordered a spring salad and black bean guacamole burger. Both were top notch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,3.0,6/8/2015,"This is a fairly nice and new Chili's right off the freeway. I agree with some of the previous reviewers that service was a little on the slow side. Our food eventually came out, and was warm & fresh. My burger was average. O-Rings were good. Their menu is pretty big. Make sure you sign up for their rewards program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Amanda B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",107,117,52,3.0,11/28/2013,"I was pleasantly impressed with the quality of Chili's food. I haven't been to a Chili's in about 12 years, way before they revamped their image.  The staff was friendly and our food came out promptly. Everything was fresh and delicious.  We went in the day before to eat there too, but we didn't stay to eat that night. We waited around the lobby area with 2 other parties waiting on tables. No one came by to take our names, a waitress kept saying someone will be right with us, though no one ever came. There were numerous tables left un-bussed which made me think there was a lack of staff, so we left after seeing the signs of bad service. Since we're in a small town, we decided to go back the next night and I'm glad we did. Whatever kinks there were in the night before were ironed out and we had an enjoyable time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Amanda M.,"Houston, TX",11,133,31,1.0,4/3/2015,"Bianca was the worst server I've encountered in a restaurant in awhile. The table wasn't bussed, things weren't brought to our table, drinks took forever to get refilled, ticket took way too long to come out. If it wasn't for the woman who seemed to be a manager we wouldn't have gotten half of what we did receive! Our order came out half wrong also. For a Friday mid-day when we were in a less than half full restaurant, I can't believe the service we received. All of the surrounding tables that she served were left empty for over an hour until someone else bussed them. People at surrounding tables also waited ridiculous amounts of time for things like drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
C H.,"Douglas, WY",0,14,,2.0,1/16/2015,Food was as expected from a chain restaurant. The service was slow. Our bartender put the S in sh@&$y service. Two groups were served before us. Had to get up and get our own menus. F U chilis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Oscar L.,"McAllen, TX",1,6,,3.0,7/18/2014,The food was pretty standard Chilies but the service was pretty slow.  We arrived at 1:30pm and didn't leave until 3:25.  So if you are in a rush you may want to reconsider.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Richard W.,"Wharton, TX",0,2,,4.0,2/21/2014,"Our server/hostess was very nice and did a great job. They seemed a little short staffed. Food presentation could of been better BUT it was delicious! Raspberry tea was good, not to sweet not to watery.. All in all it was a good experience.. I'd go back next time I'm in the area",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
William G.,"Amarillo, TX",10,1,,5.0,6/6/2014,Awesome food and the wait staff is amazing best place in plainview by far. Always love the buffalo chicken sandwich and the California flatbread pizza is amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Alfonso O.,"Plainview, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2013,"Worst experience I ever had at a chili's! The quality of food was not up to par, and the presentation could have been better.  I really enjoy going to chili's,  but just not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
Michael S.,"Lubbock, TX",0,4,,4.0,7/25/2014,"Not the fastest Chili's, but the food and service(speed aside) are great. One of the better places in Plainview to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainview-2
