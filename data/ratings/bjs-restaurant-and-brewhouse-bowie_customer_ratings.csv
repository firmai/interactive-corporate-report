36,Daryll B.,"Washington, DC",2,9,,2.0,2017-11-22,"Update: I came in for a late lunch on the day before Thanksgiving. The service remains very attentive, which is a positive. The food was so so. The fries have a crust, almost like being breaded (those with gluten allergies may need to ask to confirm whether they are, in fact, gluten free). I ordered traditional Buffalo wings. The wings came out ""Luke Cool.""  I tried one and it was below average. The quality reminded me of Sysco conglomerate brands similar to what you might find in any hospital or Federal Government agency cafeteria close to closing hour. The manager ""comped"" the wings from which I took one lonely and unpleasant bite.  Besides being cool to the touch, they lacked any depth of flavor.  The blue cheese dip could easily pass as Aldi's store brand.  Invest in a good blue cheese or make it in house using a good recipe.  The Grand Cru 2017 house brew was great.  That was my second time having the Grand Cru and it did not disappoint. Honestly, I wish the place luck. They are so close to getting it correct.  However, less than adequate wings at a brewery is unacceptable.  Your experience may be very different from what I encountered. Here are the pluses: The menu is varied, the staff is attentive, the beer is cold and good, the speed of service is great, and the décor is beautiful. Would that the food quality and temperature matched the tenacity of the service.  I may return but my expectations are much lower given this second experience.  Please try the place for yourself, maybe my visit is not indicative of the overall quality.  I hope your experience is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie?start=20,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003
34,Jada T.,"Bowie, MD",0,46,,4.0,2017-11-26,"What a pleasant addition to the BTC. Especially with so many businesses leaving the space. We tried a variety of dishes. The pizza and cookie dessert were by far, the best. We tried the Jambalaya (which was recommended by more than 1 person). But we weren't impressed. The happy hour drinks were much stronger once we mentioned they were watered-down. They also have food and drink happy hour specials. It's worth checking out. I look forward to visiting again to try some other dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
4,Cameron B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",328,73,51.0,4.0,2017-11-26,"What a nice addition to BTC this restaurant is!  I stopped by with a friend on Wednesday around 5 to check the place out and I am really glad I did.  We were greeted immediately by the host and directed to the bar area. The bar section has a long bartop with about 15 bar chairs as well as 10 or so high top tables.  We were able to grab two bar spots immediately, but by 6pm the whole bar was packed. We were greeted immediately by 2 different bartenders -- love the friendly service!  They made us rum and cokes which were a part of the $5 happy hour 3pm - 7pm special.  I did notice that the drinks made by the bartender weren't consistent.  One round would be strong and punch you in the throat while the next round was weaker and more like juice.  One round came with a lime...while the next round didn't.  Maybe those kinks will get ironed out in the weeks to come. The food is solid!  We ordered a $6 happy hour burger and fries as well as a cookies and cream pazookie.  I really enjoyed the burger and crispy fries but the dessert was the star of the show.  The have a whole menu page dedicated to their delicious pazookies! Definitely do yourself a favor and order one! While ordering food from the bar, we did notice another area of improvement -- food came out from the back for folks at the bar and the waitstaff didn't seem to have any idea who the food was supposed to go to. The waitstaff walked up and down the bar line asking each patron if this was their order.  Any dishonest bar goer could have had several free plates just by saying 'yup, thats mine'.  Help the waitstaff out and develop a better system to find the foods proper owner please! All in all, a great evening.  Loved the environment and the buzz of the place.  The menu is HUGE so I will definitely be back to try some more items and of course, get another pazookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
8,Kimberly J.,"Baltimore, MD",122,222,296.0,4.0,2017-11-27,"One word to sum up this experience: Pizookie! Omg... you have to come get one! It will change your life! Ok... I'll get back to my review now. We came to Bowie Town Center with every intention of going to another restaurant. While parking, my boyfriend noticed BJ's and said, ""well that's new! Maybe we should try that instead."" I agreed and we crossed over to BJ's parking lot and parked. The host told us the wait for 2 would be 15 mins so they allowed me to enter my number so they could send us a text when the table was ready (pretty cool!). We only waited 5 mins before our table was ready. Another hostess walked us to our table, gave us menus, explained the beer and wine options, told us about the food specials, and gave us food recommendations. She was pretty thorough and very helpful.  We had two servers, one in training and her trainer. Since they just opened, most of the servers were still in training. Even with training still happening, service was still great. The servers were prompt and came to check on us often. We looked at the beer menu, which had many great choices, but we decided to go for non alcoholic option, all which have unlimited refills. We tried the hand crafted sodas. I originally ordered the orange cream soda but the aftertaste was weird. I asked to switch to root beer and that was a much better choice. It was strong and sweet. The food menu is huge with many options. There's something there for everyone! I ordered the bacon guacamole Deluxe burger, which had pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, and chipotle mayo. It was pretty darn good. As a person who likes spicy food, it wasn't very spicy. If you are worried about it being too spicy, don't be because the kick is not strong at all. Their fries are good as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his prime rib sandwich but his side of broccoli was under-steamed to the point it was pretty much raw and tough. We saved room for dessert because we took one look at the monkey bread pizookie on the dessert menu and knew we couldn't leave without sharing one. It's pretty much warm monkey bread with vanilla ice cream on top. It was beyond words. I'm salivating just thinking about it! Sweet, warm, and buttery, with the richness of the ice cream. We had an incredible meal without breaking the bank. I would definitely come back again. Their lunch and happy hour specials are worth taking advantage of. And maybe a visit just to get a pizookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
26,Danielle L.,"Washington, DC",0,8,,5.0,2017-11-29,"My friend and I enjoyed a lovely dinner at BJ's. The food and service were wonderful. Our server was Koby, he was cheerful, attentive and his effervescent personality made it a really pleasant experience. My friend had the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger which was delicious, we tried the Root Beer glazed ribs which were yummy and Koby recommended the Snicker Doodle Pizookie for dessert which was phenomenal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie?start=20,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644
24,Debra C.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-30,I would wait and let them work out the kinks. Food wasn't bad but service was not good.

6,Jay H.,"Greater Landover, MD",93,57,83.0,4.0,2017-12-05,So how come no one told me that they opened a BJ's in bowie?  I just so happen to have a friend in town and I had her searching through yelp for a place for dinner and she asked me about BJ's in bowie.  I was shocked that there was a closer one to me than Laurel.  So we went immediately. Service:  This is a new location and I was impressed that the servers were very well versed and on top of their game.  All the food came out quickly and well timed out between courses.  It was a seamless process.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.   Food:  The reason why I love BJ's is because of the expansive menu.  I love that I can literally go and try something new every time.  This time I ordered some items from the happy hour menu.  The root  beer glazed ribs were very tender and had a great flavor.  They are very sticky but I like that they aren't enormous ribs.  Very dainty and easy to eat.  They aren't fall off the bone but they aren't tough.  Calamari nothing too special.  I really get the calamari for the sauces.  The lemon sauce and marinara sauces really compliment the tender calamari.  The spinach stuffed mushrooms were just ok.  They could use a little more flavor but they still weren't bad.  The stars of my night ...the pizookies!  These little desserts are to die for!  The salted caramel pizookie was my FAVORITE!  oh so delicious.  The only pizookie I didn't care for was the pizookie triple chocolate and that was due to the chocolate ice cream on top.  It tasted very imitation and not very good at all. I'll definitely return to try more items off the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
7,Cindy W.,"Bowie, MD",152,36,83.0,4.0,2017-12-07,"Service was awesome! I loved the cherry chipotle and Nashville hot wings! The BJs Tavern Pizza was great and I had some left over for work the next day. For dessert, we had the pizookie trio! More specifically, The snickerdoodle, monkey bread and chocolate chip pizookoe. I thought each one was bomb. The snickerdoodle one is seasonal but was the best one. Each were topped with ice cream.  I've been to both the Laurel and Bowie location now. The Bowie one is my fave. I'm so glad they opened this new location!  This restaurant is a bit pricey but the food is great.

15,Mark B.,"Glenarden, MD",6,12,,2.0,2017-12-08,"This is my first time in a Bjs restaurant I go there at the start of happy hour it had taken 45 minutes to get a burger 35 min for the mini pizza ,the burger had way undercooked bacon for anyone's liking ,crust on the deep dish pizza no crunch, not crispy. I did like the burger after I got them to cook the bacon, but that's just sooooo long to wait. I sat at the bar and my bartender Dee was great ,knowledgeable on the menu and the brews , and very pleasant. There was another bartender but she choose not to speak to me or offer any service for whatever reason . With that said I didn't complain but the server did pickup that they weren't doing to well and sent over a manager who was very nice and accommodating,  that goes along way with me but I was ready to just go been ther to long .

I told a manager there was no toilet tissue in the women's restroom. He assured me it would be taken care of. Twenty minutes later I went to the bathroom and still there was no toilet tissue.

19,Adam S.,"Washington, DC",103,8,,2.0,2017-12-11,"I get it. New restaurant still looking for a head chef but my food experience was horrible. Arrived around 6pm Sunday 12/10. My wife an I were quoted a 20 min wait but sat in about 5 min. I thought not bad for a place on a Sunday night. Seating is a little tight of you're a tall guy/gal and the overall decour was just a bunch of tvs... My waitress (name escapes me) stopped by and was pleasant. She was informative about the menu and what was what. My wife ordered a ahi tuna salad and I ordered the prime rib (medium). We place our food and drink order and they came at good time. The food however was the longest ever. I was informed that my wife's salad was done but my food was not. 20min turns into 40 and while we are debating to pay for the drinks and just leave the food comes. Food was ok came out warm and cooked to temp but an hour wait for a medium prime rib is ridiculous. After we eat my meal came with a dessert. I ordered the monkey bread pizzoki  they rave about. It takes another 30 min for the dessert and again as we were getting ready to leave it arrives. Not on the nice skillets but in some metal cheap dish. One scoop in and the bread wasn't done and no caramel sauce at all.  During this whole time the manager saw us but never came over to speak and didn't acknowledge out presence. As a restaurant person myself it's ridiculous for a manager to see a guest head in hands, no water, no drinks, or just a check in. Every table got spoken to. I don't go out for free food but the food I want and to mitigate these issues would be simple. Step 1. Hire another floor manager to check on guests or at least have two rotating so there is coverage.  Step 2. Staff levels in seemed high with such slow service. Waiteres and host bunched up at the host stand loudly talking. Start side work and send them home. Side note. (If the kitchen is backed up. Quote longer wait time to accommodate the wait. I'd rather wait thrn be seated and wait an hour for a meal.  Step 3. Hire an expediter for busy times or have the head of the kitchen to do quality checks. Standards of service is all we have between cooking at home and spending money.  Those are some suggestions that would greatly improve steps of service and keep guests coming back. For now I leave 2 stars. I'll return after the holiday season and see if it has changed as Bowie needs good spots to eat past 10pm. Best of luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

The place hasn't been open a month and all these non relevant reviewers with less than ten reviews, give this restaurant a bad review. I hope they visit again in 6 months and provide a update. Anyway, we visited on a Saturday and it was about a 20 min wait. Once we were seated, we ordered drinks and this huge $20 appetizer. It had mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, spinach artichoke dip and avocado egg rolls. As much as I love avocados I couldn't stomach those egg rolls. Just not for me, but I'm sure someone would like it. My husband ordered the deep dish pizza and I got the flat bread pizza. Everything was good and we followed it up with their signature dessert, the pizooke cookie with ice cream. We got the snickerdoodle one and it was heaven. We enjoyed every bite of it. This is definitely a great addition to Bowie and I look forward to many more visits.

I began the evening trying to be optimistic as it was an unusually busy night. My party of 3 was sat next to a party of over 20 with one server struggling to maintain his section. We waited for nearly an hour for our food for the two of the orders to be incorrect. We waited 20 minutes for a manager and never received correct orders.

Being that this is a fairly new restaurant in an up and coming area I had very high hopes. For my entree I ordered the Top Sirloin cooked medium rare. After a pretty long wait close to 30 minutes the server brought out my food. The steak looked very hard from the outside so when I cut into it I noticed it was extremely well done and cold. I sent it back and requested a new steak. After waiting another 30 minutes for them to bring out the new steak, it was so under seasoned it was inedible.  The manager decided to comp the meal, but it took the server another 30 minutes to get the check correct.

There were a variety of seating styles, big booths, rounded, regular seating. The bar looked awesome too! The glass behind the bottles made the reflection look so cool. I got the shrimp and asparagus pasta with a garlic knot. My boyfriend had a burger with bacon and bbq sauce. We both loved it. The calamari was delicious and they offered both marinara and garlic aioli dip. BUT the show stopper was the dessert. We had the mini cookie skillet trip. White chocolate macadamia nut, chocolate chip, and cookies and cream, eat with a scoop of ice cream. Oh my god I cannot say enough about how magnificent they were. The cookies and cream was a choice on a whim but is by far my favorite. It would be part of my last meal if I was ever on death row. Try it out!

Dawta, pay attention and you will be rewarded HANDSOMELY!!! I do not ask for special attention, menus, not a visit from the chef, just do your job well.  All of my dinner companions enjoyed what they ordered. I recommend the brussel sprouts. I also recommend the root beer drink. There is alcohol in it, but if you enjoy root beer, this is the drink for you. I heard good things about the sangria, and strawberry lemonade drinks, both alcoholic.  My only other gripe besides the service was the steak, too salty! I think the chef has low blood pressure, or a heavy hand. I think my blood pressure is STILL high. Besides that, we loved it.

18,Grow u.,"Bowie, MD",45,42,25.0,4.0,2017-12-30,Went for their late night Happy Hour on Friday and it was a great experience. We sat at the bar and was served by Keshia excellent server knowledgeable and she can really make a drink. My typical 3 long islands turned in to 2 of her own creations. I'll definitely go again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
2,Carol-Lynn S.,"Washington, DC",81,2,,2.0,2017-12-30,"Ok, so I went for a class reunion/holiday celebration.  The place is nice, and it was certainly crowded.  Reservations were made in advance by our party planner/classmate and followed up the day before and the day of our get together.  I was running late, but when I arrived, some of my classmates were already at the bar and having a great time.  Good service, great drinks, etc.  But when we moved to our table (and we were about 14-16 people), that's when the trouble began.  We sat for at least 35 minutes before anyone even came over.  Clearly, this is a new place and they are working out the ""kinks"" in service. But why are we asking for water when the waiter finally came over?  And why is there only one waiter for such a large party?  Not good.  Several of us went to the bar to get our drinks and paid there.  There was an awesome Mother/daughter duo (cannot remember their names) who were super attentive!   Thanks for them, BJs!  They are awesome!  And, shout out to Malachi ...he really did the best he could with the circumstances he was presented with.  He was sweet and patient, but this establishment needs to provide ongoing customer service training, from basic service as well as ensuring that you don't just ""disappear"" for 30 minutes without checking on your tables.   I would go on a tangent about that ""manager"" who came to our table and was basically condescending and disrespectful when our planner expressed her feelings about the late food, wrong food, etc.....but I will allow her the opportunity.  But I will say....it was BAD! Shout out to Desmond....he is the BEST!  Got everything together and made sure we will visit again....and I will; as long as he is there! Will probably do the bar area, until they figure out how to accommodate large parties.  They are new, so I know I need to give them some time.   And BTW, shout out to the chef...because my prime rib was AMAZING!  I did have some overcooked asparagus, but everything else was yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

17,Jen H.,"Gambrills, MD",0,22,,2.0,2018-01-01,"My teacher and I went to this place the Friday before Christmas and it was terrible. I first heard about this place watching their holiday commercial (where the girl gets their dessert and brings it home to Santa) and I thought that it looked like a nice place and should try it. The experience turned out to be HORRIBLE. We waited an hour for our food, all I had was an appetizer (chips and salsa which were mediocre) and finally, my teacher and I decided to walk out without food. We did come like 4 days before and it was just mediocre. I understand that this is a fairly new restaurant and like all new restaurants, they are getting used to everything but they really need to step it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

Wide variety to choose from. Waitress was knowledgeable about the brews.  Cons: The wait was an hour.  Once we got to our table and ordered, the food took a very long time to come out. One of our orders was wrong. The taste of the food was worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

27,Jacqueline O.,"Bowie, MD",0,1,,2.0,2018-01-12,"Visited the Bowie location on 1/11.  I ordered the Kale and brussel sprout salad with blackened Salmon.  Needless to say I was very disappointed.  The Salmon was overcooked.  The salad was not adequately balanced with the proper amount of nuts, fruits, vegetables and cheese.  The final disappointment was that the brussel sprouts were not fresh, possibly boiled.  This was our 3rd visit to this location, so I have ordered the salad on prior visits.  The level of service has also declined.  The manager was needed to find our waitress so that we could request our bill.  We watched her continue to socialize with other employees as she took her time to come to our table.  Incidentally, she knew she was wrong do she came to our table with the check. Never asked if we wanted dessert.  We could have complained at the restaurant, but we did not want to ruin the rest of our day.  I hope management make changes soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-bowie?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
