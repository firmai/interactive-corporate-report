A. S.,"Highland, IN",9,71,46,3.0,8/14/2015,"Hit or miss here. Sometimes the food is great and other times it's not that great. The last time I went the hostess asked if we were both 21 and sat us in the bar area which I usually don't mind but not this time. All of the tables were dirty and we were sat at the one clean one which was very wobbly. We moved to another table and it was directly under the air conditioner which was on full blast the entire time. The server was nice but he forgot our appetizer. Another couple came in about 15 mins after us, the bar tables still were not clean even though it was about 2pm and not busy at all, and they sat them at the wobbly table. They got up and moved too. I understand restaurants have a rotation but no one wants to sit next to a dirty table full of crumbs. This is usually the choice for my mom and I for lunch but after last time I doubt I will be back for awhile and I definitely won't sit in the bar again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40
Robert B.,"Cedar Lake, IN",0,23,17,5.0,2/27/2014,My family celebrated my grandmothers birthday here and had an absolutely wonderful time. Josh the manager made room for our large party and our waitress Staci was as nice as could be. The food was perfect and the friendly staff really made the night.

Amy K.,"Schererville, IN",0,16,,2.0,9/28/2014,Not bad but there are better choices out there.  The burgers are okay...It's an okay place to take the kids...loud enough where they can get a little rowdy and other people around you won't mind.  Last time we were there...the server begrudgingly brought out french fry refills like they were the ones that had to pay for the fries.  It took about 35 minutes to get a second order of fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40
Thomas G.,"Dyer, IN",0,15,,1.0,10/16/2013,"I used to love going here. Great burgers and fries. Good family restaurant. Last 2 times at this location I've experienced awful service. VERY SLOW. My last visit was so bad that after speaking with the area manager he apologized and sent me a $20 gift card. I was very appreciative of the gesture and decided to use it for this current review.  CURRENT VISIT. When the restaurant is LESS THAN HALF FULL it shouldn't take almost 30 minutes to get 2 burgers.   HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED DURING MY LAST VISIT. At the time of arrival the restaurant was a little more than half full. 4 people in the party. We ordered 2 burgers a chicken sandwich and a salad. 25 minutes later the server brings a second round of drinks and says he's going to check on the order. More than 45 minutes after placing our order he comes up and says, ""Sorry it's taking so long but they're holding the order because they don't know what kind of cheese to put on the chicken sandwich."" (Seriously?) In the meantime other customers seated after us have eaten and left. While walking out I exercised common courtesy and told the manager what had transpired and that we were leaving. She said, ""Your food is coming up now. Would you like it to go?"" I told her to throw it away. She then said, ""Well...you don't have to pay for your drinks."" (Really? Gee thanks. You compted 3 sodas & a water) I said, ""I wasn't going to."" Then we walked out. The manager never even offered to pay for the food.  Not sure what's going on at this particular Red Robin but I know from my last 2 times there that the service is ridiculously and unexplicably slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40

Adriana P.,"Chicago, IL",22,12,,5.0,8/25/2014,"I had a very pleasant experience here. We were a table of 5. So when our food was being served, my daughters pizza was missing. I thought no biggie, it'll probably be right up. Well it took a little longer so we started eating and I was just telling my oldest daughter how they had most likely forgotten the pizza when the nice manager came to my daughter and said no little girl should be waiting for her food while everyone eats. You just earned your pizza! & asked if I wanted more fries. I really thought that it was nice of him to come to us instead of waiting to see if I complained. Great job!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40
Jennifer C.,"Aurora, IL",0,3,,2.0,12/26/2014,"I've been to many Red Robins and I've never had bad service at a Red Robin until today. My boyfriend and I sat in the bar area around 2:30, so not busy lunch time or busy dinner time. However, it took around 10 minutes to even get greeted by our waitress and another 5 minutes just to get menus. There were about 3 waitresses and a bartender who were working the section, yet taking care of 6 tables seemed just too overwhelming for them. When the waitresses weren't pretending to work, they were chatting with the male bartender. We ordered margaritas, not super complicated cocktails, correct? Guess what? It took us 20 minutes for us to receive our very simple and unimpressive margaritas! When we were finally able to order our food, it was north of 40 minutes before we had our food in front of us. We were very frustrated and just wanted to get it all over with. Our table neighbors ordered a lemonade and iced tea, then ordered their meals. During the whole process of us waiting and eating, all they had were their drinks! They did not arrive that long after us. They were discussing whether or not they should tell the waitress to cancel their food order because they were so upset. I really enjoy the Red Robin franchise, but was sadly disappointed on what was supposed to be an enjoyable day off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40
Jennifer M.,"Winchester, VA",0,4,,1.0,4/21/2015,"Fellow colleagues and I visited this establishment over our one hour lunch break.  We ordered and asked for the check all at once to avoid a hold up upon leaving.  We waited 35 minutes for the manager to come to our table to explain one of our orders had been distributed to another table and they were in process of making new food as replacement.  We were still waiting on our bill to be returned despite having given our cash/cards some time ago.  We were offered for the other food to come out and agreed, however, a total of 50 minutes into our visit, we were delivered our lukewarm burgers and cold fries along with our bill.  Very dissatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40
Kevin L.,"Munster, IN",1,14,,4.0,3/27/2015,I like Red Robin.  It's reasonably priced and has a great selection on the menu.  I'm a fan of the Royal Red Robin burger cuz whats not to like about a fried egg on your burger?  My wife and kids always find something they like and we always leave happy and full.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40

Tim C.,"Hammond, IN",664,67,28,3.0,6/4/2010,"Maybe they're not ""gourmet"" burgers, but they're just enough of a change of pace to suit me.  Plus my six year old daughter loves the place!  So yes, it's kid friendly! We went again just the other night and our server was busy, but she was right on top of it.  She made sure our drinks were never quite empty, but she gave us time to enjoy them.  She checked on us frequently, but not annoyingly so. I like to try a different meal each time I go because I don't want to get stuck in a rut trying the same thing every time.  This time I had the Burnin' Love Burger, and it had just enough heat.  The fried jalapenos were a nice touch...  I might try to make those at home, shouldn't be too hard!

Leslie M.,"Homewood, IL",118,35,10,2.0,3/6/2010,"My family and I went here on my birthday, because it was close to where we wanted to shop (Walmart) and I had a free meal for being part of their online birthday club.  The atmosphere is cheesy and themey, which works well for someone with little kids. Fortunately I have a 3 year old, so it works well. My daughter grabbed a balloon on her way in the door, and begged to go play games while we tried to figure out our order. The games consisted of a couple claw machines, and a driving game, so there's no way we would let her play. I'm sure it's not a priority, but that might be something to think about in the future...a game that isn't a money stealer. Our server was WAY over the top, a teeny bit pushy, stalking us and constantly checking on us. I'm glad that we didn't have to hunt him down for anything, but it was a bit much.  The food was pretty decent. Some of it had the taste of crayon, which I think was just because of the paper that they wrapped it in. When I had my leftovers, sans wrap, they were just fine. It was your standard American Fare. My chicken burger was decent, but the fries were just terrible. I've had fries there before and they are usually okay. I think this could have just been a fluke. Hubs had a burger and fries. He was equally unimpressed, but not horribly disappointed. My daughter had the Mac and Cheese and some apples. Same story.  One thing that was a big disappointment was that it was my birthday. Since I didn't want ice cream they didn't sing to me. Not that I need someone singing to me in a crazy birthday songy restaurant way, but my daughter really wanted to hear it. I could tell she was really disappointed. She kept singing the birthday song over and over to me quietly, and telling anyone that passed by it was my birthday. Sadly to no avail, she did not get to hear Mommy get sung to. Big bummer. As for their bathroom, it was eh. They did have a changing table, which I try to Yelp about because who wants to take their baby to a place where you have to try and change them on the sink or some other unfriendly place. The sinks were mostly broken, the toilets weren't too clean, and the doors didn't lock. It was...passable. I think that's the restaurant's rating also, passable. Would we go there again? Yeah, probably. But our expectations are pretty darn low.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40
Shanna B.,"Chicago, IL",35,32,,2.0,9/11/2008,"My fries with the extra red robin seasoning and dipped in ranch sauce were five stars as always.  Also my burger was delicious, I had the one with guac and bacon on it.

Karen G.,"Schererville, IN",1,24,,4.0,11/21/2011,"Red Robin is our standby for good burgers.  They make good burgers and chicken sandwhiches.  Fries are usually good - but every once in a while you get some that have been sitting around for awhile - not good.   I like their Ensenada Chicken Platter, if you are not in the mood for a burger, and I love their Chicken Tortilla Soup. My husband likes their Banzi burger or Royal Red Robin.  Their onion rings are always good.  Their Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich is pretty good too.   Not a big fan of their salads, they always seem to be overdressed, soggy and wilted lettuce - the plates are usually warm, so I'm guessing they have them up under the warming lights while they are waiting to be served - not smart. You always leave full - and service is quick, and I agree with Mike C - the male wait staff seems to be on the ball - the girls need some help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40

MsAnthro P.,"Bloomington, IN",49,246,879,2.0,12/31/2007,"Seriously, I don't have unrealistically high expectations for family restaurant chains located in strip malls, but when you tout your franchise as having ""gourmet"" burgers, there really should be something special about them. In my estimation, a burger is ""gourmet"" when the burger meat itself contains gourmet or otherwise exotic and delicious ingredients. Using one standard plain burger and smothering it with completely standard burger toppings does not a gourmet burger make. Granted, perhaps suburbanites actually find barbecue sauce or bleu cheese dressing on a burger to be somehow fancy, but I'm here to say they are mistaken. Similarly, any place that heralds ""gourmet"" burgers should be using meat of a grade high enough that a medium preparation is safe. Instead, I was told that all burgers were served well done and there was absolutely no flexibility on the matter. Well done? Yeah, that's EXACTLY how I want my ""gourmet"" burger prepared. Ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40

Red Robin's big selling point is their bottomless fries.  I got fries with my burger, but there were barely any there.  Honestly there was maybe eight fries.  After finishing these, I requested more and got eight more fries.  It was honestly a hassle and I left rather than continue to order more fries because it was just not worth my time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville

Jill O.,"Lansing, IL",69,375,949,1.0,2/8/2016,"I'm definitely not likely to return to this establishment after the experience I had here. In a nutshell it was overpriced, overcooked, and had questionable service at best. I came here with a friend for an early dinner before we went to go see a movie at the nearby theater. I'd only been here once before, so I was looking forward to it. The commercials always make it look so amazing; I wish that's how this would have went! I ordered a pretty safe bet, the Crispy Chicken sandwich ($9.99). It's a fried chicken patty topped with pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I ordered mine with no onions.  Our waitress started out nice enough, but the service was so slow. It took nearly 45 minutes for our food to come out.  And when it got to the table, it was a disaster. I checked the toppings on my sandwich and sure enough, there was onions. No big deal. It's a preference, not an allergy so I was a big girl and picked them off myself. But then I bit into the sandwich... The chicken was like a hockey puck. Not just that initial delicious crunch of a good breading, but meat and all. It was tough and nearly inedible. Our waitress wasn't interested in hearing about it, and seemed to ignore when we asked to talk to someone who *might actually* care. It wasn't worth pushing further for us, so we just paid and left. I'm not happy that I paid $10+ for a meal that I couldn't enjoy, and that wasn't even correct to the order I placed. I'm not likely to come back here in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville

Nicholas D.,"Highland, IN",83,1,1,3.0,11/16/2015,"last weekend I went to the restaurant called ""Red Robin"". I noticed many things about Red Robin. When I first walked into the franchise, the place looked very clean. I walked into the bathroom and I was so surprised on how clean it was I didn't even see a spot of dirt anywhere. After I was seated at my booth I looked at the table.           It was kind of dirty their were little crumbs all over the table like they didn't wash it,which is very nasty. the atmosphere was pretty lively. I saw tons of family's eating together and some Groups of friends. It was loud from hearing the family's talk and the music from the speakers was loud. The bar was loud from all the drunken fans cheering for their favorite team on the tv. Red robin does take reservations but not to many people come in via reservations. The service was excellent, the waiter didn't let my soda get close to empty, he literally checked on me like every five minutes.        Red Robin is open 11 am to 11 pm at night , 7 days a week. The prices vary for all dishes, prices vary from 9 dollars to 16 dollars. Red Robin serves all kinds of American foods such as Hamburgers,chicken strips,and salads.i personally got the chicken tenders, they were really good the only thing that disappointed me about them is I only got three of them for 9.99$ which is kind of a rip off.

It was cool, received the burger, it was alright. In the description of the burger, it stated peppercorn bacon, the bacon was regular bacon. Then to top it all off, we was charge for the burger patty that the manager was supposedly to ""grant"" since they ran out of the original patty that was supposed to be served.  The server herself literally stood at one particular table and talked to the guest at the table for almost 20 minutes while she had another table that just got sat, didn't greet them or anything of that sort.

Christian K.,"Schererville, IN",408,393,3182,3.0,4/5/2013,"Red Robin is a decent burger joint, kinda overrated sometimes but there's nothing to complain about. When this location opened up years back it was packed all the time, now it seems that folks kinda got used to it, even when we went on a Saturday night it just seemed kinda empty.  They've got a lot of different burgers, there's was one with ghost pepper ketchup - not sure if it's there all the time or if it was just a seasonal thing, anyways though it's pretty good if your into burning your face off.  The Royal Red Robin is my go to when there's a large hunger to be satisfied. Your basic burger topped with a fried egg and bacon. The egg yolk totally brings it. If you're not too hungry, you might opt for the Tavern Double, a lot smaller than the regular burgers but definitely not as tasty since it's just your basic cheeseburger... maybe ask 'em to add some toppings or something to kick it up a notch? The Onion Tower... cool, super fried but super greasy sometimes - hit or miss here.  They have a few craft beers, Upland, Three Floyd's and Angry Orchard. Ask the server about the other two... I can't remember them.  Speaking of servers - we've usually had pretty consistent service, quick, non rushed and friendly. Again, nothing super special, but consistently good. Red Robin is good, not amazing or anything but it's consistent. When my cousin comes into town we always seem to gravitate towards this one, call it tradition? or lack of creative choices available? Both maybe? Either way... it IS on the quick choice list - the one where if you can't decide where else to go... ""this'll do"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville

Karen F.,"Hammond, IN",15,3,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Went there for burger, sad to say very overrated and burger was nothing to brag about for high price of $10 and furthermore was very greasy.

Leslie L.,"Schererville, IN",64,366,371,3.0,1/10/2015,"We went on a slow night and my hubby and I both ordered a burger and the fries. Despite it being dead, it took quite some time for the bartender to get our drinks. I started reading yelp reviews and set a timer after our orders were taken (took about 10 min for them to take our order) It took 28 minutes for our burgers and fries. They brought my hubby the wrong fries (he wanted sweet potato) so it took time to get those. If you get cold in the winter and you are looking for warmth, DO NOT sit in the bar! I was freezing! The draft kept coming in every time a new person came in. The fries were good but they are thick. Bottomless fries, wow great right? I didn't get a refill 'cause I was stuffed! Neither did the hubby. Burgers were tasty and I did like mine. Honestly though the appetizers look good and I might come back to eat those and drink. The burgers and fries were okay in my book but nothing I would rush out to get. One thing I did notice and was a little odd was that my burger came in a basket, wrapped in foil like a fast food burger while my hubby's burger came on a nice platter. I asked the waiter/bartender and he said that it was because my hubby had gotten the higher quality burger. Very odd because my burger wasn't that much cheaper than his. Sorry Red Robin chain guys, that isn't that attractive to me. I see what you did there but it's not like my burger was 2.99 and his was 10.00. The bartender/waiter was really nice and friendly though. He was upbeat and had a good personality. Honestly that means a lot to me for my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20
C G.,"Saint John, IN",0,322,39,3.0,8/20/2016,"Brought my family here for lunch on a Saturday. It was actually pretty slow. We were seated right away and greeted by a waitress who too our drink order. Soon after she brought our drinks and took our order. A salad, turkey sandwich and soup, Mac N cheese and tenders for my children. It took 25 minutes! I think that was way to long for what we ordered especially when the rest wasn't even busy! When we finally received our food it was good, but my daughter barely received our fries and the waitress didn't offer any more. My husband's soup was a joke. The size was ridiculously small. For what we had, the quality and the wait.....it was WAY overpriced. I really feel that since Red Robin revamped their restaurants and menus it has really gone downhill. Not sure if I'll be back. Much better options in the area! I will say our server was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20
Kathryn O.,"Crown Point, IN",91,81,17,3.0,2/14/2015,"I was contacted by management and sent a $15 gift card.  So we went for a late lunch the other day, we were 1 of about 3 tables in out section.  Our server was Britney, very nice and attentive!  She was on top of everything!! Even bringing us more fries.   The food was decent.  We started with onion rings, hot and delicious.  Really enjoyed the dipping sauces. I got the whiskey river burger.  Good burger, they didn't ask how I wanted it cooked but it came out perfect. My fries came out cold, but my husbands were hot... Weird.  My husband had a double burger, he liked it, nothing crazy good but he was satisfied.   Overall decent experience with the highlight actually being our server Britney.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20

Kashmir A.,"Dolton, IL",2,7,3,4.0,6/19/2015,"Red Robin is one of the best burger joints to come too when your in the mood for a delicious burger. I came here as a pre fathers day treat from my lovely wife. The only turn off from this location is that when we arrived, the hostess was not there to seat us. We waited almost 10 mins before someone notice we were there. I am docking one Star because of it. However, the burgers was on point as usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20
Crystal K.,"Saint John, IN",0,3,,3.0,3/18/2017,"I have never been a fan of Red Robin because I know it's overpriced and the food, as I remember, was very greasy. My friend and I walked in and the host was taking names for a wait list. We asked if we could sit in the bar as there were many tables and seats open in the bar area. The host said yes and we followed him into the bar. About half way into the bar the other hostess came up and said we weren't allowed to sit there so we turned around and waited up front to be seated. They did not take our name and said it would only be about 5 minutes. After about 20 minutes of waiting another family came in and asked to sit at the bar that was empty and was angered because the host told them there was a wait list, the hostess (the one who had told us we could not be seated) told the family she could seat them. In total we waited 30 minutes to sit at the bar. The service was great however! Our waiters name was ZJ and even though he was very busy he was absolutely wonderful. He didn't make us feel rushed and was very quick and on top of it! The drink and food I ordered was actually really good to my surprise, but maybe because after such the long wait I was so hungry I could've thought anything was good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20

I am not sure what happened, but I have been ordering that for YEARS and never had that problem,.. The waitresses never listened to me the 2nd time when I asked to make sure the fat was off.

This place is disgusting & wayyyy over priced for a lil bitty burnt burger! $15 for a burger? Never again! This experience really did it for me! I ordered the blood orange margarita & they gave me a Bloody Mary! Burned my throat! It took me 20min to get the rite drink! When I did get the margarita it was suppose to come with fruit slices but didn't! Also my fiancée burger did not come with the grilled onions it was suppose to have!

Rosa J.,"Chicago, IL",373,1007,3544,4.0,9/19/2014,"Before I begin the review, I have a disclaimer to make: I'm writing this review under my own free will.  I know it sounds extremely strange as my introduction to this review, but the upper management from the Red Robin headquarter was visiting the store.  I know what that means.  It's time to put out a show.  The server friendly informed us that because she was a bit over the top in terms of service.  I wanted to emphasize that she did a great job.  I manage a retail store so I know this wasn't the most comfortable situation when the executives and upper management were scrutinizing you.  You need to deliver!!  Regardless whatever was going on, my D. G. B. Burger was delicious.  It comes with the garlic mayo dip that goes well with the bottomless fries.  Everything was cooked well, and overall, I was satisfied with the service.  I wish the upper management didn't watch the server and guests with their giant hawk eyes and gave us more peaceful time to munch our meals.  I hope the day went well for the server and she received great accolades from her bosses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20
