76,Miranda M.,"Waltham, United States",120,2,,4.0,2016-01-08,"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time yesterday and had a great dinner. The servers were all very attentive, as this location just opened a couple days ago. We redeemed a coupon for a free small plate through the rewards app and chose the chips and guac, which was DELICIOUS- the guacamole/corn thing they had was very good! Will definitely go with that again. We each got pizzas (I got the 5-cheese and tomato, while my boyfriend got the works), but if we go there again we would probably just get one pizza to split- I ended up having some of mine leftover. The location looked very clean and trendy. There were some little mistakes (not enough drink menus so we didn't get one initially and then had to share, not knowing how to process the free small plate reward at first, messing up our check) but the staff dealt with all of the mistakes with grace and efficiency. I think most of these things can be attributed to how new the restaurant/staff is. We overheard some issues with other tables (food coming out at different times to the same table, plates being dropped, etc.) but again, this is a new location.  One critique for the chain in general- why is the menu lacking in the beer department? Very few beers available other than your typical Bud Light/Sam Adams/Blue Moon etc. I don't think you have to go crazy with it, but when I order a pizza, I generally want a beer, not wine or sangria. (My boyfriend and I got wine and sangria, respectively, and agreed that while the drinks were good, they didn't pair as well with the pizza) Overall, a good start with a few hiccups at this new location.

86,Errin S.,"Topsfield, United States",0,1,,1.0,2016-03-08,"Awful. I went last Friday when it first opened and it was great. Came back a week later and it was awful. Sat at the bar and my drink was empty for atleast 15 min with no one checking in (FYI we were the only ones sitting at the bar). The two young female bar tenders were too busy gossiping and checking their phones to check I on us. Our pizza took 45 min and was cold. We had to get their attention to tell them 1. We needed silverware 2. Our drinks had been empty for 15 min and 3. Our pizza was cold. Their response was very rude and basically told us to either wait for a new one cuz the ""kitchen was backed up"" (even though there were only 3 other tables there) or suck it up and eat it.

She called in advance on Monday and three times tonight and spoke with different women who said coming at 6:30 would be fine and there would be a table ready for them.  When they got there at 6:32, they were told by a male manager that they were 20 minutes late and their table had been given away. He insisted the call ahead time was for 6:15, although she never spoke with him. No apology. No suggesting a way to accommodate them other than making them wait 45 minutes.  We have both worked in restaurants and go with the philosophy that the customer is always right. At the very least, the customer is not flat out told that they are wrong. Once they were seated, the wait staff and food where really good. A female manager noticed it was her birthday and offered a gratis dessert.

56,Kimberly K.,"Peabody, United States",51,241,55.0,2.0,2016-09-17,"Everything was edible. Our service was fine. The setting outdoors with the heaters was quite decent. I just expect more. The pizza is way better at Otto, which is a shame, because this atmosphere is far better. My cocktail, California Roots, tasted ok. It was just too sweet and you couldn't taste any alcohol. The best part was the fennel salt rim, which I got hardly any of, but they promptly fixed it when I requested more. The cocktail portion of the drink menu lacked prices (annoying) but this was 10-something. Not unexpected, but it was an 8-something drink. His pepperoni pizza tasted great, but was dripping in bright orange pepperoni oil. The bottom was drenched with it. It was gross. With a tiny pre-plating dab, this mediocre pizza could've been awesome. I got the Pear Gorgonzola, with ranch on the side. Glad I did that, as the ranch was ""just ranch."" Ew. A tiny drip moistened the pizza, but that's about it. The Gorgonzola crumbles were meager and the pears were not roasted and flavorful. In fact, the whole pizza just tasted like a cheese cracker. I'm amazed at how flavorless one of the strongest/flavored pizzas at other places can be here. It wasn't horrible, but it was just kinda meh. That, and they put regular old salad greens on top. At least 6 were rotten, which takes 3 seconds of quality control. Lame.

The best part was the fennel salt rim, which I got hardly any of, but they promptly fixed it when I requested more. The cocktail portion of the drink menu lacked prices (annoying) but this was 10-something. Not unexpected, but it was an 8-something drink. His pepperoni pizza tasted great, but was dripping in bright orange pepperoni oil. The bottom was drenched with it. It was gross. With a tiny pre-plating dab, this mediocre pizza could've been awesome. I got the Pear Gorgonzola, with ranch on the side. Glad I did that, as the ranch was ""just ranch."" Ew. A tiny drip moistened the pizza, but that's about it. The Gorgonzola crumbles were meager and the pears were not roasted and flavorful. In fact, the whole pizza just tasted like a cheese cracker. I'm amazed at how flavorless one of the strongest/flavored pizzas at other places can be here. It wasn't horrible, but it was just kinda meh. That, and they put regular old salad greens on top. At least 6 were rotten, which takes 3 seconds of quality control. Lame. Please use arugula, roasted pears and pungent gorg.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.056,3.1200000000000006

The Bread they served was STALE!! Hard as a rock and had a weird taste to it. Kind of like sour milk.  I ordered the Spinach dip as an appetizer- it was ok, needed more cheese for me and some of the chips were stale as well. Beginning to think if anything is fresh at this point. Tasted like they just took a cream of spinach package and used that. I had their Kung Pao Spaghetti (did not realize that it didn't come with any meat) and their pasta is VERY Dente. Meal would  have been better with chicken. Now for dessert i had their butter cake-OMG!!!! Wicked good and I would go back just to have that. I also had their Honey Lemonade , this consists of Jack Daniels and Lemonade- Yummy! My husband ordered the chicken dumplings for his appetizer and they were good, only issue is the plate was cold so they cooled down FAST! He had their Chicken Alfredo for his meal. His Pasta was definitely Ala Dente Some pieces he could not even eat. It was also bland, just needed some spices. For dessert he got the Chocolate Soufflé. He said it wasn't anything special. He ordered a drink, said he's not sure what the bartender made as it did not taste like what he normally gets. I guess maybe we should have stuck with their pizza. If we go back maybe I'll just stick to that and dessert. That's a BIG if!! Our waitress was good. She even fixed our bill when we found they had charged us extra for my husbands pasta!

I came here on my 22nd birthday with my friends. I have been a server for a few years and try not to criticize but our waitress was AWFUL. worst I've ever had in fact. Our drinks took probably 20 minutes which isn't her fault but instead of pushing the bartender she kind of just walked around and kept saying few more minutes which was annoying. She did not have much knowledge of the menu at all and she let us order not one but two appetizers that they were all out of. Had to reorder twice. Before we even finished our appetizer she took it away and didn't even ask if we were done (which I wasn't). I assumed okay maybe she's clearing room cause the pizza is coming out. Wrong. 20 more minutes with nothing on the table. Finally pizza comes out and it's amazing. California club pizza is TO DIE. once again takes the pizza before we were done and I asked her to box it. I counted the pieces in the box when we left and she didn't put all of it in our box  dessert time aka bday time. They tell her it's my bday and I order a piece of red velvet cake. She comes to the table with it with other staff singing and gives the cake to the wrong person...worst and most awkward happy Birthday in my life. Didn't even apologize after either which I thought was really rude. She kind of ran off and some other server stuck around to apologize. He also got us silverware since she left us with nothing to eat with. Best part she kept the cake on the bill lol. I've always taken a dessert off for a birthday maybe that's just me but how it went down it should not have been on the bill. The next day I thought about it and decided to call and tell the manager what happened because as a former server, it's always in the best interest to be aware of issues so they can be addressed and fixed. And I also felt like I deserved some sort of apology gift card or SOMETHING. like it was my birthday?! Manager basically said sorry that sucks we'll have to do more training. That's it. Didn't even seem to care. I was shocked especially since if my manager ever got a call like that something would've been done immediately. Love the food but will never dine in again at this location.

She did not have much knowledge of the menu at all and she let us order not one but two appetizers that they were all out of. Had to reorder twice. Before we even finished our appetizer she took it away and didn't even ask if we were done (which I wasn't). I assumed okay maybe she's clearing room cause the pizza is coming out. Wrong. 20 more minutes with nothing on the table. Finally pizza comes out and it's amazing. California club pizza is TO DIE. once again takes the pizza before we were done and I asked her to box it. I counted the pieces in the box when we left and she didn't put all of it in our box  dessert time aka bday time. They tell her it's my bday and I order a piece of red velvet cake. She comes to the table with it with other staff singing and gives the cake to the wrong person...worst and most awkward happy Birthday in my life. Didn't even apologize after either which I thought was really rude. She kind of ran off and some other server stuck around to apologize. He also got us silverware since she left us with nothing to eat with. Best part she kept the cake on the bill lol. I've always taken a dessert off for a birthday maybe that's just me but how it went down it should not have been on the bill. The next day I thought about it and decided to call and tell the manager what happened because as a former server, it's always in the best interest to be aware of issues so they can be addressed and fixed. And I also felt like I deserved some sort of apology gift card or SOMETHING. like it was my birthday?! Manager basically said sorry that sucks we'll have to do more training. That's it. Didn't even seem to care. I was shocked especially since if my manager ever got a call like that something would've been done immediately. Love the food but will never dine in again at this location. Truly disappointed and my birthday was ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.216,2.56

The Bread they served was STALE!! Hard as a rock and had a weird taste to it. Kind of like sour milk.  I ordered the Spinach dip as an appetizer- it was ok, needed more cheese for me and some of the chips were stale as well. Beginning to think if anything is fresh at this point. Tasted like they just took a cream of spinach package and used that. I had their Kung Pao Spaghetti (did not realize that it didn't come with any meat) and their pasta is VERY Dente. Meal would  have been better with chicken. Now for dessert i had their butter cake-OMG!!!! Wicked good and I would go back just to have that. I also had their Honey Lemonade , this consists of Jack Daniels and Lemonade- Yummy! My husband ordered the chicken dumplings for his appetizer and they were good, only issue is the plate was cold so they cooled down FAST! He had their Chicken Alfredo for his meal. His Pasta was definitely Ala Dente Some pieces he could not even eat. It was also bland, just needed some spices. For dessert he got the Chocolate Soufflé. He said it wasn't anything special. He ordered a drink, said he's not sure what the bartender made as it did not taste like what he normally gets. I guess maybe we should have stuck with their pizza. If we go back maybe I'll just stick to that and dessert. That's a BIG if!! Our waitress was good. She even fixed our bill when we found they had charged us extra for my husbands pasta! They really need to improve with their food. At least they had plenty of servers standing around.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lynnfield,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
