128,Seta M.,"Hempstead, NY",11,59,16.0,1.0,2012-01-16,"I will not be going back to Chili's again. My wife and I have avoided Chili's because we didn't see too much in the way of food for vegetarians. In 2012 that is actually bad business.  We received a gift card for the holidays for Chili's and on a whim we decided, hey, let's give it a chance. We ordered drinks and appetizers while we tried to scour the menu for something we could MAKE vegetarian even if they didn't have the courtesy to give us good choices. We are pretty adept at doing this (as a few places we have gone to haven't caught up with the times yet) so this was not unusual. We got our appetizers and main at the same time. Not quite what we wanted to do. What we did choose for a main took a lot of creativity and settling as even trying to find something we could switch to vegetarian took some doing.  We ordered a white zinfandel and I'm not sure what company it came from, but it did not tast good. Dessert was good however. We had a chocolate cake with 2 scoops of ice cream.  Now I probably would have given the experience 3 stars even though we did not get what we wanted, however here's what ruined my night and as days have gone by have made me angry. We had a gift card for 50.00. The bill was 42.00. Here is what the waiter did when he got the gift card. He took it and said thank you and began to walk away. We were surprised and kind of looked at him. He, acknowledging our surprise said it again and left. So we lost $8.00 on this deal. He did not offer us a credit for the difference, he did not acknowledge the difference in the bill, he just left.  Both my wife and I were annoyed by this. This is where the restaurant lost the other two stars. Chili's need to do a better job with things like this. They need to join the 2012 list of businesses like Red Robin and California Pizza kitchen that offer vegetarian alternatives and actual vegetarian meals. Their commercials make you want to go to the place.

Good luck finding a spot in the lot and have fun waiting 45 minutes or more to be seated. Wait... I can't.. do this! Too many bad words that will tarnish the one Chili's. It's too good! I love you Chili's! Your food, your prices... it's just too much for me to handle! I'll put up with the parking and the waiting just to sample some of your cheap and delicious foods.  I love spicy food and almost everything on the menu is spicy or can be spicy at your request. Cozy Mel's (in the same restaurant pavilion) wishes they could execute a restaurant this good. I love their appetizers and their 2 entrees and one appetizer for 20$ menu.

90,Joan R.,"Valley Stream, NY",350,360,105.0,4.0,2012-08-11,"Expect a wait. At least 45 minutes on a typical weekend night. Why? Because it's that good. Chili's offers some basic  building blocks for a little happiness in life. Good solid food. Reasonable prices. Friendly and accommodating staff.  A clean festive venue to socialize in. A place to get away from it all if only for a little bit. This Chile's is pretty big, bright, and lively with many colorful multi-tiled topped tables, booths, and a sizable bar. There is always a big mass of hungry people, families and young adults, waiting to get seated on a Friday and weekend nights. You can call ahead for call ahead seating, although I have not tried that. The servers were very nice and the guys were very built and pleasant to look at.  My single friend could hardly contain herself. If you join the Chili's Email Club you can get emails  with exclusive offers. I recently got an email for a free appetizer with a purchase of an entree. When you first join the email club you get a voucher for free queso and chips. The club sends a lot of different coupons over a course of time. Here's the good stuff: - Southwestern Egg Rolls $8.29 6 crispy flour tortilla filled with smoked chicken, black beans, corn, jalapeño Jack cheese, red peppers and spinach. Served with avocado-ranch dressing that had more ranch than avocado. This is absolutely delicious, rich, and flavorful. -Fire Grilled Corn Guacamole $5.29 Made with fresh avocados, cilantro, house-made pico de gallo, fire-grilled corn and jalapeños. Served with tostada chips and house-made salsa. Sweet, cool, and creamy. -Margarita Grilled Chicken $10.79 Classic Margarita-flavored grilled chicken with hints of lime and citrus, served with rice, black beans, tortilla strips and house-made pico de gallo. One of the healthier meals with only 550 calories and with good flavors. Heartening, nourishing, and tasty. -Fajita Trio Fajitas$14.89 Meaty grilled steak, tender chicken and scrumptious spicy garlic and lime shrimp with grilled onions and peppers. Served with 3 warm tortillas, house-made pico de gallo, mixed cheese and sour cream.  I would order it Cadillac style with rice and black beans for $0.99. The 3 tortillas it came with are small and may not be enough to use all the meat on the skillet. -2 for 1 beers on Friday night. We got 2 mugs of bud light for $4.

I believe the waitress didn't give us the receipt back after we paid because she was afraid I would take the survey and let everyone know how horrible the service was.  We sat down and was approached by a woman who was currently training. Don't remember her name. She said there were also two gentleman who would be helping out. Throughout the night not one ever came up to us to let us know they were helping out. First off the waitress had no knowledge about the beers. I asked her if she had pumpkin and she had no clue. She also told us incorrect beers that were include in the specials. I decided to just get an Iced Tea. I had a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. We showed the waitress and ordered the Texas cheese fries as well as our entrees.  After that there was a leak starting above our table. I felt as if I was taking a shower. The hostess moved us to a different table and she was very nice. We waited a while for our food. When it finally came out, the entrees came out before the Texas fries. We weren't happy. The manager came over quickly after that with our fries. She dropped them on the table and said I'm sorry about that these are on us. She also got us refills. Well obviously the fries are on you we had a coupon so that really did nothing for us. She never told us her name of anything or ever come back to check up on us. Honestly nobody checked up on us after that for about 10 minutes to see how our food came out or if we needed anything. We had empty cups that sat on our table for most of the night. Horrible pre-busing.  The table across from us remained dirty for about 25 minutes. Not something we want to be staring at while we eat our dinner. The food was actually good though but that was defiantly the only positive. I got a to-go box for my food. Got our check then didn't see our waitress again for a while. Had to ask another gentlemen to find her for us so we can pay. He said he would take care of it for us which was the correct thing to do. We sat very close to the POS system where everyone was standing including the manager so I honestly think we should have been checked up on sooner and there should be no reason our table should be dirty. We all work at a restaurant down the street from this location. I am a manager, the other two friends I was with were a server and a cook.

Wait times can be 20-60+minutes during weekends - I usually wait 30-45. You can call ahead to put your name on the list so that the wait can be shorter for you. My deepest wish for this place is that the menu lists food allergies or contamination from shared oil or pots CLEARLY next to each food item. This is a practice that's becoming more common. While Chili's website has a list of food allergies, it is inconvenient to have to look it up each time and just takes more time to place the order.

Fajitas never came so I said screw it, take it all of the bill. Talked to Scott the manager who did not understand how to run a bar. Guy was useless.

104,James B.,"Long Island, NY",7,90,,2.0,2016-01-10,"You be the judge... We ordered chips with salsa and paid for the extra guacamole. Chips were extremely greasy.  Salsa was very watery and barely stayed on the chip.   Guacamole was decent. The chicken fajita was weird.  The chicken quality is not the best, and it seemed to be very skimpy with the peppers, onions, and rice.  Just seems like a poor value, and I only ate half of it because it just didn't taste that fresh... One mango iced tea was decent and not overly watered down, the other blackberry iced tea tasted funny (almost like a beer taste) and had to be replaced with another.  Aparently, it still had a mild beer taste to it.  Either it tastes like beer, or the plastic mugs they are using may be poorly washed and you may be drinking someone else's beer schwag that sat at the bottom (let's hope this isn't true). One of us ordered a grilled chicken dish and the chicken had a weird skin piece on it that even the waitress thought was strange.  They took the piece of chicken back and left the rest of the plate.  Well over 10 minutes later, the waitress came back with another piece of chicken on a small dish.  Most of us were just bout done eating by the time we got the replacement chicken piece.  They didn't even offer to take that meal off the bill. The fries were decent.   Overall, service was functional, but I would not rave at all about it. Gotta give this location a Thumbs Down...I have had better meals at different Chili's locations.

53,Yue Mary W.,"New York, NY",260,190,34.0,1.0,2016-01-28,"0 star review! One of the worst chain restaurants I have ever been to :( Came here for the unlimited enchiladas and had food poisoning the next day. Even though the restaurant was nearly empty at 4 pm, we were somehow put by the back corner. Our table was dirty and had left over food (including a juicebox and dirty napkins) The service was extremely slow and our waitress barely made eye contact and acted like she did not want to be there. She kept on walking pas us and not check up on us. Our water cups were empty most of the time. When it comes to the enchiladas, i have nothing good to say... The first round had maybe 1/2 meat and a little big of sauce, looked similar to the menu image and tasted 6/10  The 2nd round consists of two wraps with one tsb of meat each. By the 3rd round, we were eating just the wraps and 1 pinch of meat... and it was barely warm... I will never return to this restaurant due to the bad service and inability to bring food that actually taste like food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.212,2.8

65,Zach H.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,1,4.0,1.0,2016-02-29,"I guess I have to give Chilis one star (by default.) This being my first review I hesitantly descend down the path of food and business snobbery, and  I don't know if its even fair to begin bottom feeding on the likes of a discount chain such as Chili's, but this experience has created a need to verbify a website, and for the first time YELP.          Crowded to start, in retrospect can't even understand what the wait might be for, seeing that there is a halfway decent Cantina type spot two doors down. They tell us of a 25-35 minute wait and ask for a phone number.      Moments later we receive a text confirming we are on the list and it includes a link to download the app . It says ""Check you place in line with our APP!"" Considering we are two, and low wage hostesses are not usually the best logistical calculators, we stay after seeing 9 open tables and 2 finishing.  We also Also download the APP so we can SEE OUR PLACE IN LINE!.       Now Chilis, as a corporation does my first experience using your new ""technology"" have to be a complete sham for you to obtain contact information?  ""There are 5+ parties ahead of you"" DUH... that's why we downloaded the app to see how many there were, or is solely intended to be for people who are unable to count to 5? Worthless!           After 25 minutes we were seated, several of the previously mention available tables were still not being patronized, and for a little bit of fun we checked the app again, you know to measure your technological advances, and still there were 3 parties ahead of us at time of seating, .       Now the above was just the opening act, we came because we were hungry, had the reached the end of a strip of restaurants, and thought hey why not go here.    The first thing we got was the fried asparagus, besides the breading almost completely falling off, after a little self assembly they tasted fine. We never had it before and thought hey this is good. Then came our dishes, not only Yelp worthy, but worthy of opening a Yelp account to do so!   1. Shrimp is not white, or spongy, or under cooked, or chewier than the gum that had just been spit out. It was pink in the picture so it should have been on her plate. My GF had about three bites and was already thinking her stomach was going to hurt.   She does not eat meats besides fish and shellfish, so the thoughtful gesture of INCLUDING A CHICKEN CUBE IN HER RICE was not so well received.  2. I did not order my fajita meat, med, rare, and spoiled.  Unless that is the combo where you get different styles all on the same plate.  The beef tasted rancid, but the carnitas tasted worse. They were even more unpalatable, and gritty, and also had several different temperatures of cooking. About 3 bites total before we were on to the check.    They forgot to bring us the rice that was an upsize option for .99 with the fajitas, so the manager had to be found to take that off the check.     I understand that you are a chain,  you offer lower priced food.  But you market yourself as fresh, and it just wasn't even within an acceptable time-frame of being fresh.  I took the items to go,just  to get a second opinion, and gave the instructions ""just taste that"" and they spit it out.   The only reason i did not bring it to the attention of management because, I did not want to be punished with the potential that another option may be offered. That was the last time Chilis will be an option, and even if it was the only option I would decline. A more fitting slogan should be ""I want my moneyback, moneyback moneyback."" Because you did not serve food that was edible, and the only reason i just paid it,  was because i did not want to bring any stress to a Chili's waitress who probably had to deal with the repercussions of your poor management, and terrible products.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=60,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.404,2.76

115,Sara S.,"Great Neck, NY",0,31,,1.0,2016-03-26,"I hadn't been to Chili's in about 15 years (when I was much younger and didn't know any better).  Back when I had no real concern about  what went into my body during finals week in grad school (the rule is that you can eat whatever you want in order to say alive during finals week), my go to was the Chicken Crispers.  I haven't eaten them since as they have enough fat and calories to kill a small island of people, but because we were hungry with a child in tow(and I have fond memories), we decided to revisit (it was a revisitation for me, my husband had never previously had the pleasure of surrendering his will to live to Chili's).  The first thing we noticed upon being seated in a booth, was the filthy sticky table and dirty menus.  This should have been the sign we needed to just get up and go somewhere else, but we stuck it out.  My husband ordered a beer (for which he waited literally 20 minutes,) and a full rack of ribs which were unsatisfying at best. Despite WANTING the chicken Crispers with every fiber of my being, I ordered a steak burrito (which I'm sure is not a healthy option, but compared to the chicken Crispers, it's a spa salad).  The burrito was pretty tasteless, which is surprising.  How does one fuck up a burrito?  It basically tasted like nothing and was a fairly boring eating experience until I felt a sharp pain and my mouth started bleeding.  I spit out the offending bite, and found a medially sized jagged shard of wood IN my burrito.  I mentioned it to the waitress and she apologized and removed my food.  The manager (who was appropriately contrite) came over and apologized but said ""I can't imagine what that could be bother than a chicken bone.""  When I informed her that I had ordered the steak burrito, she said it must be a piece of a wooden skewer.  She apologized and comped my disgusting burrito (although imo, she should have comped all of our food as that was substantially  large infraction.  Because we were still hungry, we did order an additional appetizer size of the chicken Crispers, but either they had changed since the last time I ordered them, or I just had horribly shitty taste as a 25 year old, because they were beyond gross and my husband and I were both doubled over in stomach pain for the entire night.  Chili's will not be a place that we go EVER again, but when we left there was a rather long line, so I am surprised that SO many people are willing to consume such shitty food on such a regular basis.  America, you confuse me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=80,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.404,2.76

As soon as we walked in, there were some people waiting but there was no hostess. For about 4-5 minutes, we waited at the hostess area with noone around. A couple minutes later, shefinally came by and rudely said ""excuse me"" because I was leaning on the hostess area because I have torn ligaments in my foot. So I moved and I expected her to apologize for the long and unacceptable wait just to put our name in. Nope! Once we were seated, we all discussed that we wanted the guacomole so when our waiter arrived, we said asked for it and he told us that he was very busy and if we could give him a break and not order it. Never in all of my dining out have I ever heard that. I wanted to still order it but my buddies feared what might happen to our entres once we ordered them. Our waiter had the nerve to say that he could come back with the avocados and the raw materials and that WE could mix it ourselves. UNACCEPTABLE. Getting crackers for my chili and 5 waters was even met with attitude. This boggles my mind because he had time to interrupt our conversation about Universal Studios to ramble on and talk abt his vacation to Disney world to us while we payed the check.

The best part of my visit was our waitress, Jennifer! She was pleasant and very helpful when it came to helping us decide on what to order (I asked her what would she recommend ) everything on the menu looked so great! I got their ribs, and unlike other places, their ribs were amazing! It had that smoked flavor and didn't have a weird taste to it. Everything was cooked to perfection. I was quite nervous because it was my first time at chili's but I am sure glad I decided to give it a try. Another great thing is you won't have to worry about your pockets, their menu items are very very reasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=20,3.16,2.94,2.94,,3.0280000000000005
22,Jenny O.,"Jericho, NY",0,3,,3.0,2017-11-25,"This was my first time here so my expectations weren't that high. We had the steak and shrimp combo fajita, and it was pretty good- the shrimp was very tender and although I didn't try the steak, everyone else said it was great. However the ribs- we got a full rack- was very dry and not as hot as expected. They also had a very weird flavor. But our server was very friendly and outgoing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury?start=20,3.16,2.95,2.95,,3.0340000000000007

There were 10 or more tables open, so I asked the young lady why aren't we sitting she replied the ""guy"" has to assign the seats which I replied I been here 35 minuets and I have seen the freakin ""guy"" yet. We finally got seated. The waitress greeted us pretty fast  The food was ok The waitress was pretty good  Over all was ok",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury,3.24,2.94,2.94,,3.0600000000000005
3,Sherry S.,"Valley Stream, NY",60,62,80.0,4.0,2017-12-10,"Came with a party of 6; 4 adults and 2 kiddies, Around 10pm last night. The server was efficient and friendly, especially with the kids. Food and drinks came fast and were pretty yummy. Chili's had twofers, I'm all in there with the mango and blackberry margaritas. Haha. The table had; steak nachos, fajitas, chipotle ribs which were all pretty good. My brother loves a good burger but he wasn't crazy about their Old Fashion burger. One kid liked his Mac and cheese but my godson didn't like his Popcorn chicken looking meal, he said it was too dry (it was).  Another server was cleaning around and was kind of rude and gave us a non working mini kiosk thing that you can play games and pay the bill with. Overall, our server was efficient, kind, patient and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westbury,3.24,2.94,2.94,,3.0600000000000005
