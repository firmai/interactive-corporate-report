Love the Whiskey River BBQ burger, 5 alarm, Banzai, milkshakes, desserts, and lamb burger! the bottomless fries are also a plus! Also this place is great for you gluten freers! U can get all burgers gluten free and gluten free bottomless fries!! Great service bottomless specialty drinks are amazing too! Staff also great and knowledgeable!

23,Alex F.,"Edmonton, Canada",72,321,,4.0,2012-08-20,"Red Robin is a favorite of mine for food in the city. They have AMAZING milkshakes, yummy strawberry lemonade, steak-cut fries cooked right (not raw on the inside) and seasoned well, and lots of tasty entrées. Most of the entrées come with ""bottomless fries,"" so you never have to worry about getting enough food. The atmosphere is more fast food / diner-ish than most burger places, with a lower price point, making it ideal for summer cravings. The place is usually busy, but I've never had slow service here. With one exception (noted below) the service has been excellent -- the staff are enthusiastic and accommodating.  Generally I wouldn't complain about one instance if I've been to a place many times without issue, but this was kinda weird. During my last visit to the restaurant, our waiter greeted us and right off the bat arrogantly told us we'd have no problems because he was amazing. Maybe he was joking, maybe he wasn't, but either way, it was really off-putting. When I have dinner with my fiancé, I just want to sit down and have a nice time, not be used as a tool to feed some pompous d-bag's ego.  That aside, I've had many good experiences at this Red Robin, and will keep going back -- I'll just make sure not to sit in that guy's section!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton?start=20,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007

33,Eric H.,"Edmonton, Canada",3,18,,4.0,2012-12-31,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants because the quality of the food, while consistent, is usually mediocre. Red Robin's, however, has chosen to do one thing and do it well: burgers.  My favourites would have to come down to the gourmet cheeseburger and five alarm burger. The gourmet burger comes with your choice of cheese (provolone is nice). The relish hits the right sweet and sour notes, and the fresh tomato and lettuce offset it nicely. The five alarm burger is great if you're addicted to spicy food as I am. The pickled jalapenos are tasty. On either burger, the patty isn't really special but they use a special seasoning salt that is quite nice. The other thing that I can recommend is the fries: always crispy and hot. They are thicker than most fries which is all good. You can taste the potatoey goodness. The fries are bottomless as well! If you are dining for two you can order one extra basket and that's usually enough even if you are both fry lovers. As for the atmosphere, well it's a little bit sports bar / American family restaurant theme. It is popular with young families so it's busy on Friday nights at about 6 pm on, and it's not unusual for the entrance to be littered with elementary school aged children, what with the video arcade and all. Still, if you go early on Friday or a weeknight you shouldn't have too much trouble getting a seat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton?start=20,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

We were quickly escorted to the lounge because the dining room was packed with people.  Red Robins reminds me of all the highlights of the 1980s. There were also some old arcade games in the corner that reminded me the times when I was into arcades. My sister, Rosa ordered her free birthday burger, my other sister, Karen ordered a monster strawberry milkshake and I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter and shared it with Karen. But before long, Karen was thinking she might have an allergic reaction to the sauce in the platter and possibly the milkshake.  The manager, Ian came over to assist this situation and came back with a list of other foods she can order according to what she couldn't eat.  She choose the chicken burger.  We had a very eventful evening, with my entire meal remade, there were refills on the fries and Rosa for her Red Robins birthday song! The best part was we didn't have to pay for our food! The young adults that worked here were very impressive.  They were very professional, friendly and have a servant's attitude.

28,Brett C.,"Edmonton, Canada",3,132,,1.0,2014-04-23,I've been to this restaurant several times before and normally it would be about a three star rating. The last time we went we sat ourselves in the bar like we have done many other times before especially since there was no one at the hostess stand. The hostess came by and scolded us for seating ourselves. Then we were promptly ignored by all the wait staff for 15+ minutes. No one came to take a drink order or anything.  Finally we got up and left and ate somewhere else. They had plenty of staff working and it wasn't that busy. They were all standing around chatting. We haven't been back since and it's going to be a while before we give them another chance.

24,Shelby O.,"Southwest Edmonton, Canada",5,9,1.0,2.0,2014-12-22,"What... Just happened?... Such a weird and awkward experience from end to end.    So we arrive and ask to sit in the lounge because it's 75% empty but are told it will just be a few minutes (scratches head). So we wait in the lobby area with the broken door that stays open in -20 so everyone is freezing. We spend the time looking longingly at the dozen or so empty tables that are cleaned and set and ready to seat.  After 15 minutes we are sat at the table we were looking at since arriving. If there was no free server we sure would have at least like to have sat down while we waited... The guy at the table next to us came over after we sat and was like ""We had the same look on our faces too! Wtf?!""  So clearly our experience wasn't unique.    After about 5 minute we were awkwardly greeted. 5 minutes later the server asked if we wanted drinks and we noted that there were no prices anywhere on the drink menu and asked what they were. ""What do you want and I'll tell you"" was the reply. Asking pitcher and pint prices for a couple beers that were on the menu required him to go ask someone only to come back and tell us they didn't carry those beers or 2/3 of the other beers on their menu for that matter. Why are they on the menu then?!?!     The one saving grace for this visit was the onion rings. They are unbelievable! If you can order them to go then this place is worth the visit. Besides the onion rings the burgers were meh and the fries were terrible. We even got the ""cheesy herb"" fries. Of course we weren't told that it cost and extra $2 per meal and weren't told they taste like cardboard pulp. McDonald's fries are better, and those are terrible!   If you want decent half assed burgers & onion rings just go to A&W over Red Robins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton?start=20,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

Our food took 45 min. I watched our food sit under the warmer for 20 min. Took 30 min to get a drink refill. When our food finally came the kids got a second order. I said they already ate. The adults haven't yet. Needless to say it was cold and soggy.

13,Alouise D.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",150,530,113.0,4.0,2015-02-15,"I'm a fan of this Red Robin's, but I'll admit to bias (my friends and I used to come here a lot when I was in High School). There are several Red Robins in Edmonton, and they're all pretty similar. I'm usually on the southside though, so if I go to a Red Robin's it's usually this one.  My friend and I came here for dinner on a Wednesday night at 7pm and the place was packed (so much for our, ""it's a Wednesday at 7pm no one will be going for dinner now"" plan). Usually, if you're dining without kids, you can just go up and seat yourself at the bar, but not this night. The hostess asked for our names and said we'd need to wait for a table. It took less than 5 minutes (benefits of dining with just two people, less time to wait usually).  I always (unless I decide to order alcohol) get the freckled lemonade. It's a lemonade with sugar sweet strawberries in it (and real strawberries, not just strawberry juice or syrup). It's more expensive than the fountain pop, but it's also a free refill drink. It's pretty delicious, but there's usually quite a bit of ice in the glass so I'll usually get a few freckled lemonades with my drink. Red Robins is mostly known for their burgers, which as pretty good. My favourite is the banzai burger (with pineapple and teriyaki type sauce), but on my last visit I got one of their new signature burgers the black and blue which is a burger with blue cheese and portabello mushrooms. It's on a ciabatta bun, and while the burger was delicious (blue cheese =  my heaven) the bun was pretty dry. I'd definitely sub it out for another bun next time.  The regular fries are also bottomless and thick cut and delicious, but I went and tried the new parmesan garlic fries (not bottomless unfortunately). They were really good and a nice change from the regular fries.  It's a chain restaurant, so you won't get anything crazy groundbreaking, but if you want a pretty good burger in a family-friendly place Red Robins is a good staple. Also they have a small arcade by the entrance with a few games including The Simpsons. It's like my childhood all over again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

12,Stephanie R.,"Edmonton, Canada",120,67,308.0,4.0,2015-07-10,"We always come for the free birthday burgers (sign up online, $12ish dollar value... birthday person also gets an embarrassing song and an ice cream sundae), which means, our family of 5 is there at least 5 times a year. The adults also like to come for the lounge sometimes. There are some fun daily drink specials and they pair nicely with the $5 appetizer menu... a roll of quarters for the arcade round out a fun inexpensive date afternoon. I'm not a beer drinker, but I do enjoy their beer-based 'can crafted cocktails', and I order their margaritas and big-kid freckled lemonade often enough too. We've mostly always had great service, I think the staff is likely trained to ensure that you leave happy. This is def one of those places where you should politely speak up if something is not quite right... they'll work it out. They've often gone out of their way even without me having to say anything at all. I've also noticed that the staff I did not find as helpful is rarely there on subsequent visits, and yet there are other staff members I've seen there for years.  If we're there for a full sit down meal, like our birthday visits, I almost always order a Stampede Burger, but I swap out the bun for an onion roll, add jalapenos, and substitute with a garden patty for the meat - all at no extra charge. My kids often get the Blue Ribbon burger and the Prime Chophouse burger, with their own set of substitutions. Though my kids are too old for it now anyway, they've never been kids' menu fans, though they appreciated the colouring pages and crayons. I also nearly always get the freckled lemonade (I just love the thawed frozen strawberries in it) with that burger. This is a bottomless drink, and if you feel like mixing things up, you can get different bottomless mixed-drinks upon re-order... so sometimes my kids get the Prickly Pear, then the Cherry-Lime Flip, etc. etc. instead of the same drink over and over. The steak fries are bottomless... so are the yam fries if you upgrade to those. Both are fantastic, so I always have a hard time choosing which to order. Obviously I never leave here hungry, in fact, I typically over indulge and leave in PAIN... so a year or so ago, I started cutting my burgers in half and have cold leftovers the next day, packed up with about half of my second refill of fries. The steak fries are fantastic with the RR signature seasoning, but I also ask for balsamic vinegar - this confuses some of the newer wait staff, and I sometimes end up with their balsamic vinaigrette in a cup or malt vinegar, so have to re-ask.  My on;y real complaints are that, with so much traffic, the place is a little run down and could use more frequent sprucing up. I also absolutely hate when their tables with the fold up sides are put together for larger groups, very awkward... their half booths are wayyy cozzier, I wish I did not have to remember to specify want to sit at them every time. Also, I used to love their tacky mostly 90s music playlist and miss it so much now that it's mostly a mix of newer bubble-gum pop... though it's a little hard to hear anyway, it's a pretty noisy place 'cause it's so busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

I almost always end up overeating when at a Red Robin location due in part to the calorific burgers and bottomless sides. It's definitely more calories than I need so I don't visit Red Robin terribly frequently as a result but it's a fun place to visit just the same. I wish I was better at picking out a delicious burger from the limited time offerings though as I often pick out ones that are less delicious than I expect them to be (if they're not as good as my favourite normal burger, I  feel like I've made an ordering mistake, seeing as I really like that normal burger!).

Red Robin specializes in gourmet burgers and fries. I have been to this location numerous times and have never had an issue. The food is always fresh and the fries are always hot!  On this past trip we had a party of 4 and it took 15 minutes to get a table. We arrived just before the lunch rush however they were waiting on another waitress which is understandable. The waitress was great with our orders. She let us order our drinks and food which was nice and she was very friendly.  I recommend the ""Chophouse"" burger if you are a fan of Mushrooms and onions. It had a lot of flavor and hit the ""I need a big burger"" spot. For dessert my wife had the mini donuts and I do recommend them. The donuts come with chocolate dip for a taste of something sweet. Red Robin also has really good milkshakes! if you're stuck in the lobby waiting for a table they have a mini arcade that features some of my favorite games. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Cruisin World, and the Simpsons.   This location is in walking distance of my current residence so I tend to visit this location a lot!

As well served my sister in law who is pregnant a burnt on the outside and raw in the middle burger, she asked for well done. I'm not a professional cook, but even I know well done isn't higher heat, just kept on the heat longer.

17,Michelle B.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,9,,2.0,2016-09-10,"It's not only the look of the place that's changed.  This place used to be a favorite but the quality has gone down significantly.  Went with a party of 5 tonight. I have never seen this place so dead. Never mind on a Saturday night.  When we got our food, 4 of the 5 of us had fries, all the fries were cold and old. Chicken burger was overcooked and dry. Told the waitress about our fries and she apologized and since they're bottomless we didn't make a huge deal of it.  The manager did come to speak to us to apologize and then after we had all finished eating and had our plates cleared, he brought us fresh fries. A nice gesture but a little too late.  The service was good, the food took a long time to come out and it wasn't anywhere near the quality we're all used to at Red Robin's.  Not sure if I'll be back or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

Last time I visited the Whitemud Crossing location was almost a year ago so this is my first visit since the renovations and I love it! It's so welcoming and comfy, I really liked the way the tables are organized and the variety of sizes. Servers were really nice and helpful, don't hesitate to ask them about the menu, they know everything about their specialties. Usually I order a banzai burger wrapped in lettuce but this time I forgot to mention that to the server and it came in a bun, at least I won't forget to order it wrapped on lettuce the next time, I really like the combination of fresh lettuce, pineapple, chicken and onions, it is crunchy and you can feel each flavour. I would like to organize a Christmas gathering here, I think we will have so much fun and there is enough space for everyone, including kids!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
8,Piper K.,"Edmonton, Canada",14,18,13.0,2.0,2016-12-18,"Dined in at this Red Robin location at 4211-106 ST NW. Last experience hasn't the best. This newly renovated location brings a new style to the classic 80's look of a diner than a traditional restaurant. The atmosphere is a lot more family friendly but lacks areas for quiet conversation and traditional dining. Adorned with images of different places around the world, neon signs and a more formal look makes this place a but confusing to how they might be displaying a unique dining experience. The servers are abysmal in their approach to an almost smug approach to seating guests and the delay for servers is long. Took nearly 20 minutes from being seated to when the server approached and did not apologize for the wait. Servers are not dressed in normal clothes one would expect for staff at this type of restaurant.  Ordered an appetizer first. Towering onion ring ($12) with bacon sauce. Food was hot and had good taste. Sauce was not what I was expecting but had a nice flavour to it. For the main course I ordered the prime rib dip without onion added garlic mushroom side fries while my guest ordered the darn good burger with yam fries and a side of bacon dressing. His Burger arrive a little cold and the meat was undercooked. The yam fries came there was a hair in the fries and the server brought us a new basket of fries but did not take the old one. My prime rib dip was satisfactory but they did not bring enough au jus  to get my sandwich with which was also very messy. We both decided not to have dessert and the service overall was pretty lacking. The bill came to $47 approximately for two people and I found the rate and cost of the food a little high for what we received. I expected better service and quality of food for the establishment Red Robin which is a well-known company and restaurant. The servers need more training in hospitality with guests and knowledge of the menu. The chefs or line Cooks in the back need to be able to understand English to fill the orders. As I was sitting close enough to the kitchen to hear a lot of the cooks not understanding the tickets. My overall score for my visits and review is 1.5 out of 5 stars. There is definite room for improvement. This is the end of my review at this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

Red Robin has a variety of burgers you can choose from and you can even get them lettuce wrapped. Personally, I like my burgers with bacon, cheese and fried onions.

9,Jenna S.,"Calgary, Canada",0,3,,2.0,2017-05-21,"I highly recommend the teriyaki chicken burger, it was delicious.  When we went here, our service was TERRIBLE. We were there for over 2 hours.  We were seated right away, & it took our server 10 minutes to bring our drinks. We she brought them she was just going to drop them off, when I told her we were ready to order she seemed caught off guard. The whole meal we were constantly asking our server to fill drinks, & just overall do her job. After being there for an hour and half we asked for our bill, which once again took about half an hour to bring to us.  The food was good, I'd give it a 4/5. The service was terrible,  a 0/5, hence the 2/5 rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
14,Susan L.,"Edmonton, Canada",84,19,1.0,1.0,2017-05-21,"Rizza was friendly but inattentive. The restaurant was quiet.  I was just about done my food and had to call someone else over to order an additional item. Initially when I walked in the restaurant I sat down in the lounge.  There were 4 customers in the lounge so I didn't expect to wait as long as I did for someone to come to my table.  Several minutes after I sat down, the waitress came by and said she'd be right with me.  She brought her other customers some drinks and didn't even think to drop off a menu on her way by me.  Finally I got up and went to the restaurant side.  There was nobody at the reception area so I looked around the corner and a very young, very snotty, short girl (didn't get her name) came around the corner.  I told her I would like to get something to eat and just wanted some service.  She said, ""well, I'm here!!!"".  She was very cold, unprofessional, never smiled, didn't say, ""hello"" or ""how are you?"" She lacked customer service big time.  I don't think I've ever, in all my life have been treated so poorly by a restaurant employee.  Food was decent but a horrible experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
6,Michaella X.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,14,6.0,4.0,2017-08-14,"Nice burgers and loved the endless fries! I got the chophouse burger because I'd been out of the country for a few months, and was craving a good burger. The presentation was great and the party was juicy (though the edges were a bit charred). Loved the fries and especially the bacon sauce! Highly recommend it. It's sweet and salty, and has that good, hearty, meaty taste of bacon. If you're not into fries, they also do endless vegetables or fruits. Beware that some fruits are prepackaged fruits though. I didn't personally get it, he onion rings tower looks really cool and I will ty it next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
1,May A.,"Southwest Edmonton, Edmonton, Canada",7,16,15.0,4.0,2017-09-10,"This place is a family favorite for us. This is definitely a family restaurant. They have Mini chalk boards for them to play with also they give crayons and activity placemats. Keeps them busy while you wait for food. They do change the placemat activities so you aren't doing the same word search or picture search. I have gone when they are super busy and they bring out complementary fries so you can snack on before you get your food order. My kids like the mac and cheese and I do too.   I sneak in a couple bites If I can. The kids love the Mandarin oranges and they give free refills so my kids usually get 3 refills. Love the guacamole burger, hot wings and fish and chips. Once a year you can buy gift card and get a 20% discount you have to buy a certain amount but worth it if you go often like my family does. They have remodeled the south side one. I short of miss the train guess I'm nostalgic. Would definitely recommend for families.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

Enter, Red Robin!  I knew he was a burger guy so this was the perfect place to take him. We didn't have to wait for a table at lunch time and were seated right away. The restaurant was busy so it took a while to see our Server. The menu options are a bit overwhelming and include everything but the kitchen sink, but we managed to find something ;-)  After we ordered our Server brought us some 'bottomless' fries which came out hot! I am talking, burn your mouth, kind of hot. I haven't had fries that hot since... never! I take it that means they are fresh. Our burgers came out as ordered with a ton of toppings and tasted great. I would swear on a bible that they were never frozen and if they were you would have to really convince me otherwise.

I have visited this establishment on more that one occasion (were talking in the double digits for sure), and I've never been disappointed!! The last time we were here, I noticed the menu changed. I miss the days where everything was listed on one sheet. I find there are just too many options and I can never decide. Whisky River Wrap with bottomless speckled lemonade? Yes please!! If you're looking to change it up, order some sweet potato fries to go with it. I have never been disappointed with their their regular fries either though.  This location looks like it has recently undergone renovations (at least from the last time I was here) and the place looks great! Gives it a nice fresh, new feel to the place.
