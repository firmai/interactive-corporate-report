Michael I.,"Denver, CO",3,133,,5.0,2/11/2015,"My wife has celiac disease, so when we heard that CPK has celiac-safe gluten-free pizza, we wanted to check it out. Victory #1: They have gluten-free pizza at all! Victory #2: When I called the restaurant to find out if the California Pizza Kitchen gluten-free crust contains corn (which my wife is also allergic to), they were able to find the answer in just a couple of minutes - no corn! Woo hoo! Victory #3: The pizza is delicious, as it turns out. I've tried a lot of gluten-free pizzas, and this one is my favorite. We went with the barbecue chicken pizza, adding pineapple, and it was awesome. Victory #4: The waiter, Zach, actually understood celiac disease and was sensitive to the fact that, for instance, they didn't have any gluten-free desserts, thus keeping my wife safe. Awesome, awesome experience all around. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20
Ed G.,"Littleton, CO",33,179,6,2.0,6/12/2016,Oh my god what a difference a few months make! I always came here for the chicken tequila pasta with the habanero salsa. I ordered it today only to find when my food arrived that they have no more habanero salsa! Bummer! I would not of ordered the dish if I would've known. They tried to give me another sweet salsa but it was clearly not what I wanted! The waitress had no offers replacing anything. I think it was in her first week of working. My partner ordered a veggie pizza. And I guess if it's possible she said it was overly flavorful! Disappointing service disappointing food everything was a disappointment today. Probably won't be back! Only been coming to CPK for years! Sorry it ended like this...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20
Jeff T.,"Denver, CO",0,24,5,1.0,2/8/2017,Holy cow what a disaster this place was tonight. Horrible service & then the food came out separate from the rest and cold. Had to notify management. They finally bring everything out & my guest feels immediately sick with sharp stomach pains!!! Also had a piece of a broken plate or something in the salad and luckily I spit it out in time.

Actually, my favorite part was the food, which is pretty important for a restaurant.  Most of my group ordered the lunch duo but I wasn't pretending I wanted soup or salad. Give me pizza! I ordered a full-size Thai Chicken pizza and I even got my veggies in for the day. The base peanut sauce was a unique and delicious start, topped with grilled chicken, slivered carrots and bean sprouts. Winning combo right here.  The service was good enough but we felt kind of ignored on the back porch. It took us a long time to get silverware and napkins (after our bread and oil came out) and my pizza came out several minutes after the rest of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20

I know a lot of employees and whatever restaurant you would call before they open would of not answer the phone or just tell you to call back at 11am when we open. She is an asset to your company.

Alyx V.,"Denver, CO",438,63,52,4.0,3/9/2014,"CPK is a classic and it's one of my go-to's when I'm in the area and looking for a place to go with friends.  It's casual, but the food is really good, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the service is good.   Their pizzas are very creative and I definitely recommend perusing that menu first.  If you're not in the mood for pizza, that's okay!  They have plenty of other entrees to choose from.  I usually try to mix it up every visit, but one thing I won't give up is the sweet corn guacamole appetizer.  I look forward to getting it every time I go, but I never get it all to myself, as everyone I'm with loves it, too.   Their salads are also usually a good bet, and they have quite a few good ones to choose from.

T K.,"Riverton, UT",0,18,1,1.0,5/8/2017,"Quiet for a Tuesday night at 6, and so better service was expected. Started with some wine at the bar. While sitting here had to watch the bartender mispour a glass of white wine for another table. Then tried to ""pawn"" it off on the other waitresses so the store could make up for the ""loss"". My salad comes out with the meal which seemed a bit odd, and was wrong as it had ingredients I'd previously asked not be included. While eating my meal(which was good don't hear me wrong!), I'm watching the manager negotiate with the waitress and bartender over who gets to go home first--at the Bar, in front of customers!  Who does this???  Then a waitress comes up to speak with the manager about how the cooks are screwing up her orders and she won't talk to them anymore, and he needs to go back and talk to them because they don't know the difference between cucumber and corn???  The last thing I get the privilege to hear is how one of the waitress' ""who-ha"" hurts so bad because of what she did yesterday--a Brazilian. While it's nice to know you trimmed the bushes sweetheart, it's not complimentary to my appetite for some dinner. Won't be going back to this location--EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20

I enjoyed the revamped menu and ingredients and the healthier choices are not just smaller versions, they are just made healthier.

Samantha E.,"University Heights, OH",174,895,271,3.0,6/19/2012,"CPK has never been my favorite pizza, but some of their offerings are great and you have to give them credit for consistency. I came here with a friend for dinner last week on a weeknight; we hadn't seen each other in a while so we were planning on having a relaxing dinner to catch up.  Our waitress seemed intent on not allowing that to happen.  She asked us for our drink order within seconds after I sat down, for our food order within seconds of opening the menu, and seemed visibly unhappy every time we had to tell her we were going to need another moment.  Later, when we wanted the check, we couldn't find her.  Go figure. On the bright side, the food was as good as I had remembered.  We split the barbecue chicken pizza and, continuing the theme, the barbecue chicken salad.  I love the flavor combination on the pizza and the salad was good as well-- I think the corn and black beans go very well with the chicken and barbecue sauce.  It's nice that it's a chopped salad as well.  My glass of wine was reasonably priced and so was my friend's sangria, which she enjoyed. I'd go back because I like CPK and I like Park Meadows, but I'd hope to sit in a different section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20
Michelle A.,"Aurora, CO",259,638,104,4.0,5/19/2014,I really enjoyed the two yes two pizzas my friend and I ordered.  We had the new summer salad on a thin cruist and a Margarita.  Ok so we each took enough home for the next day but we did eat plenty.  The crust is thins and crunch and all the ingredients were tatsy and fresh.  We must have been on a carb overload that nigt because we had bread and oil before the pizza.  Yum!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20

The posted hours was for the restaurant to be open at 11am.  The manager unlocked the doors a few minutes after 11am.  He promptly seated us. We ordered the Artichoke and Spinach Pizza on thin crust and the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza on honey-wheat whole grain crust.  Both were excellent.  The whole grain crust was a little dry, maybe overbaked.  Toppings were plentiful and evenly distributed.

Jacob L.,"Louisville, CO",137,213,170,5.0,6/5/2013,"I was very impressed with the service and the food quality of this location. I came here for a late lunch with a close friend after doing some shopping at IKEA; we had a hankering for some pizza! Upon arrival, I was slightly surprised by how small this location is! They do offer outside seating, but it was a bit chilly and we opted to wait around 10 minutes for a table inside.  We were served by Kelly and I am happy to say she was one of the most fantastic waitresses I have had at any restaurant. She was quick and attentive, always bringing refills of our drinks before we finished the previous glasses. The food, as usual, was great. I have never been disappointed with the food at California Pizza Kitchen and this was no exception. I had the California Club Pizza and it was perfect. The Spinach Artichoke Dip is also fantastic and I used the leftovers to dip my pizza crust in. Quirky? Yes, but it was awesome.  Overall, I had an extremely pleasant lunch here. The only recommendation I would have is to show up a little early if you are coming during a peak time. Park Meadows is a popular location for shopping and with the small nature of this restaurant, waiting times could increase pretty quickly.

The Chicken Club isn't bad either, although nothing to write home about.   I guess all in all, CPK is just an unexciting place to me.  Everything is adequate, but nothing stands out.  Its only benefit is its prime location in the Park Meadows area, which makes it a good lunch spot for those in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=40

I brought it to my waitress attention and she apologized and brought a fresh salad out. I also over heard her tell a manager about the issue and they did not suggest any other ways to accommodate me or cared to know what table had the issue.

Kristin B.,"Westminster, CO",42,61,150,5.0,2/28/2016,"I haven't been to this restaurant in a very long time so my boyfriend and I thought we'd check it out. This location was really nice and clean, the music wasn't too too loud and the hostess was polite. We signed up for the rewards program and got a free petite plate. We also got a free order of their bread with olive oil mix to dip it in. It was realI ordered the chicken dumplings and my boyfriend got a thin crust pizza. The dumplings were soooo good! My boyfriend said the pizza was delicious too.  The waitress checked on us often but not so much that it was annoying. Overall great experience.  We will definitely come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Barbara M.,"Littleton, CO",23,142,,3.0,1/8/2017,"I would give CPK 5 stars easily, but I have one complaint that overshadows.  I love their Chopped BBQ Chicken Salad and ther BBQ Chicken pizza. I order it with dressing on the side and then comes the question, ""would you like a side of avocado with that?""   The price for that side just went up from $2.75 to $3.00!!!!!   Are you flipping kidding me?  Do you know I can buy 1-3 full avocado's for that price.  I'm pretty sure as a nationwide chain, you can do MUCH  better than I can.  Yet you without shame, boldly stick it to your customers.  Irritating!  Now if you don't want avocado with your food and you think they aren't bolding sticking it to you with your pricing, please step inside and order away.  My choice, no surcharge or $1.50 tops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Chrissie O.,"Escondido, CA",251,807,857,4.0,6/6/2016,I was pleased with my visit at CPK.  We were starving so we stopped here after landing. I told the hostess it's my first time at their location. They told us about their sign up list thing and if you do it then you can get a free appetizer. Yes of course I will do it! I was also surprised that the manager stopped at our table and gave us a free flatbread which was delicious and so nice of them to do. We ended up sharing a bunch of plates. I really liked the chicken Thai pizza. Thai peanut sauce is always delicious. Also had the penne pasta with pesto. Another delicious choice! Pesto another one of my weaknesses. Definitely a great place to go if you are in the area or hungry after shopping!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Lisa C.,"Denver, CO",178,45,3,3.0,8/6/2017,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for an early dinner and service was lackluster. Really slow, us and other customers around us had a hard time getting drink refills and food took a lot longer than normal even though it wasn't really busy. Food was still good though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Ray K.,"Lone Tree, CO",5,210,416,3.0,6/17/2016,Nice atmosphere and spacious place to bring a large group. We typically get a couple of pizza and appetizer to share. Get the Sicilian pizza and the Works to share. The pizza style is thin crust.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Jesse B.,"Denver, CO",485,289,353,5.0,5/29/2016,"I hadn't been to CPK for a while. We went to the Park Meadows location after a rugby game in Littleton. The highlight of the meal was our sever Alexis. After we asked to sit on the patio Alexis greeted us and immediately noticed our table was wobbly. She went and got some coasters to stabilize the table. Big bonus points. Throughout the meal she refilled drinks, made sure we were ok and was an awesome waitress. I had the Jamaican jerk thin crust pizza. The sauce is a little sweet but the jerk seasoning, bacon, onions and peppers helped to balance it.  I also had bites of the roasted vegetable salad with grilled chicken and shrimp (extra add-ons). The dressing was a little heavy but otherwise it's very tasty. Definitely going to go back again. Thanks again to our great server Alexis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Loreen G.,"Aurora, CO",75,22,,3.0,7/3/2017,"The staff here are impeccably friendly and attentive. Our server Cierra was lovely. My son loved his pizza, which was awesome. I come here occasionally and always order the chicken tequila lime fettuccine. This location is lacking in its ability to cook this dish, which makes me sad. The sauce here is runny and bland. The Cherry Creek location makes this dish spectacularly! It's too bad as there are a lot of positives!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Kim C.,"Aurora, CO",6,72,127,3.0,11/20/2016,Always a good go to on a mall day! Our server was very impatient. We signed up for the promo.

Jason P.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,2,4.0,7/3/2017,This was a good restaurant I got the original  bbq pizza it was good as always but the waiter messed up we asked for half pepperoni and bbq she just faces us a bbq pizza but she was really nice about it she offered us another pizza overall good restaurant bit pricey,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Shwetha B.,"Irving, TX",116,143,516,5.0,8/10/2014,"My husband and I loved their California veggie pizza. After having tried pizzas from various other chains where the cheese overpowers all the other flavors, this pizza was a refreshing break. The honey wheat-grain crust was amazing. The vegetables on the top were very fresh and yummy ! Blast of so many different flavours with every bite.  The bread with the olive oil-herb dip was good too. Will definitely try all the vegetarian pizzas they offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Lindsey P.,"Longmont, CO",92,246,317,3.0,8/3/2014,"After a day of shopping, we were really looking forward to some cheap, great drinks and good food. Eeeehhh, California Pizza Kitchen is probably not the place. They don't have a happy hour and their drink selection is just okay. We decided on sangria...and a pitcher would have been great. Buuuuut, they don't offer pitchers. Boo. She got the Appleberry sangria and I got the Caribbean Sunset; both were very good. We shared a caramelized peach salad and a margherita pizza; perfect amount of food to be shared by two people. We were both very pleased with both of these. Very tasty. Also, our server was terrible. Not at all friendly. She would disappear for long periods of time (we were out of water for most of our meal). Wait, they work off tips right?! Right. I'm sure she figured it out eventually. I do usually like CPK. Had we known that they didn't really have what we wanted, perhaps we would have gone elsewhere. But we were pleased once we decided on a few things. The service sucked, and that's okay. Maybe it just wasn't our day for CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Janet G.,"Kansas City, MO",0,2,,1.0,12/28/2016,"Worst customer service ever!  My daughter and I visited last week.  I understand that the restaurant was in the midst of the holiday season, HOWEVER, I have never seen a more disorganized, poorly run location.  Absolutely no one, from the manager to the hostess knew what was going on.  I witnessed one family with four small children drag their children from the restaurant crying after they were promised a table for 20 minutes. Tonight, we ordered to go for our family hoping for a better outcome.  COMPLETE FAIL.  We ended up having to call a delivery service to produce the two hour old pizza - another $40 charge.  Ted, the manager, is absolutely useless and unhelpful.  Do not trust anything he says.   I will never try this restaurant again.  Long time fan - will never return!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Peter S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",30,355,281,5.0,7/28/2015,"Colorado Springs is a dead town for foodies and as a New Yorker in exile I suffer greatly.  On the way back from the Denver airport, before we drive south to the culinary wasteland, we stopped at Park Meadows Mall for a little shopping and dinner. Many options around the area but CPK is a family favorite. We had Avocado Club Egg Rolls with spicy ranch to start, which everyone loved. I ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza which was like an amazing pie version of a taco by the same name. Great food, great family experience, great service - 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3
Alexander S.,"Fort Collins, CO",4,2,4,5.0,7/3/2013,"Great service, Great Food, and Great atmosphere!! Really enjoyed our lunch today at California Pizza Kitchen!!

Erin J.,"Denver, CO",61,380,20,2.0,4/19/2009,"Honestly, this place is really overpriced for what you get. The pizza is ok, not much to brag about. Don't spend the money if you're just going to get a pepperoni pizza.  The salads are good though and I'm a fan of the chilled shrimp rolls. Overall, just not blown away and would rather spend the money somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=60
Shankar R.,"Dallas, TX",15,74,83,4.0,7/11/2013,"We were here for dinner on Sunday night. They do have larger dining area also patio. It took 15 minutes for seating as the restaurant was fully occupied.  We ordered Spicy Chicken Chipotle pizza and Thai chicken. The order took longer time, might be lot many pizzas were ahead of our order. I liked the chipotle style pizza which is topped with beans, salsa, cilantro and lime.  Thai style pizza tastes little bit sweet, because of carrots and peanut sauce.  Service is fantastic and the staff is very professional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=60
Robin M.,"Littleton, CO",1,9,,5.0,4/25/2013,"What's not to love about this place...salads, pizza, tv's and great service. Went here for a kiddos b-day dinner, they didn't disappoint. Hubby and son split a bbq chicken pizza - so fresh and yummy. I had a thai chicken salad (or something like that)...great blend of flavors. The waiters are always great, they brought lot's of drink refills and refilled our bread plate several times. Loved the oil with seasonings for dipping! We had a fun night here; ate pizza, watched March Madness and went home full and happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=60

I was able to try a bit of everyone elses - all the pizzas were great and the salads were so fresh and tasty as well.  Great place to go, only downfall in my opinion is that it is a chain, I prefer local establishments.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=60
Felecia C.,"Aurora, CO",49,34,45,2.0,9/14/2010,"I think CPK's problem is they're trying to be something they're not. You walk in and it's really crowded so you think it must be good here if all these people are here. Well that was my first mistake to think that. We were seated somewhat quickly but our waitress wasn't very friendly and definitely had some attitude. After we ordered it felt like ages until our food came, I figured it was because the place was busy but still it felt like forever and after that wait I hoped there would be something really good on my plate to eat. I ordered the vegetarian pizza just because I was in the mood for something different and filled with veggies, and was dissapointed because it barely tasted good, the crust was dry, and it was all lukewarm.. Bleh the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they serve Shirley temples, and they gave me a place to sit.. I tried samples of their pizza at costco and I'm sad to say the frozen pizza was better then the one made in the real establishment. Don't come here unless u want not worth it overpriced food and a wait long enough to watch an episode of your favorite show.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=60

Ben S.,"Palo Alto, CA",47,113,52,3.0,3/8/2008,"Most chains turn me off, big time.  But I like CPK - they have good food, it's good for the kids, and they have some excellent salads. The service is generally good, just be careful if you go during a ""peak"" time - you can expect to wait.  But their pizzas are very good, some nice pasta dishes and I love their salads! Crayons and coloring crap for the kids are a nice touch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=60
Cass D.,"Englewood, CO",140,921,257,3.0,3/2/2009,"My friend from HS worked here for a while. I went into the location for some grub a couple of times. The hostesses were very inattentive. One time I was standing in the front for a really long time, I wanted to leave really badly. Waitress was great. The manager that I met was very nice. Menu doesn't have an incredible amount of variety. They try to fancy everything up, even though it's 'just pizza'. Kinda reminds me of the Cheese Cake Factory. Food is good though I guess. Don't try and cook their frozen pizza's in Colorado though, they suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=60
