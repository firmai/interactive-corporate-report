Dave S.,"Lee, FL",0,18,,2.0,9/7/2017,Hostess was not on station for 5 min after I arrived at about 7pm on a week night. I finally tracked her down and she seemed aa bit miffed that I had.  Waitress took 10 min to even show up.  After I explained that I was tired and in a hurry she did a great job from there on. Food was a shrimp naan dish which I came to regret ordering as it has a few small rubbery shrimp-like creatures with a mountain of greens wrapped in the Naan bread. The bread was good.  The beer was good.  Overall not the best dining experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Ashley B.,"Detroit, MI",91,94,112,4.0,1/14/2017,"I will come to this Fridays before I go to the one that is closest to my home (the southfield location) for this reason...no matter what day it is, it is always dead in here!   I really do not understand why either! The service is always great, the food is always great...it is a mystery why this location is never packed! It's Saturday night, the Seahawks vs Falcons game was on (it was a playoff game too!) and it was barely anyone in there!  But anyhoo, our server was very helpful and quick. As usual, the food was great. I always get a burger or the sizzling chicken and cheese and lots of drinks! The only reason I took off a star was because of today's experience and not overall. A kids hockey team walked in (at least 10 kids) and were seated in the bar area. I don't know if it was because they were loud and yelling the whole time or the fact that adults were in the bar drinking and trying to enjoy the game (you know how men can get with beer and sports) but they moved the entire party right behind my boyfriend and I. They were so loud that we left in the middle of dessert. When we walked out, it looked like the whole other side of the restaurant was empty. Why not place them over there instead of right behind a couple CLEARLY on date night?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Cooper P.,"Rochester, MI",16,11,3,2.0,12/13/2017,Weather was horrible so I decided to place a to-go order with TGI Fridays. The bill came to double what I was told on the phone it would be.

Mark D.,"Lapeer, MI",0,8,8,1.0,10/13/2017,"A group of us have been coming to Fridays for the endless apps, it was 10 dollars then went up to 12 dollars, but they just raised the price again now 15 dollars.

Alexandra L.,"Troy, MI",0,22,,1.0,11/19/2017,"Ugh. Why does Yelp force it's users to give at least one star?! This location of TGI Friday's doesn't even deserve half of one. Grabbed mozzarella sticks during my lunch break and they literally tasted like they had been fried in week old oil. Immediately after I got off work, I called to speak with a manager. I explained it to her as clearly as I am explaining it now, and she acted like she didn't understand. ""So you're saying there was no cheese inside? ""Me: ""no, I'm saying they were made in old grease."" Her: ""well we have had the same grease for only three days and won't be changing it again until tomorrow morning so if we remake it for you it will be made with the same grease."" First of all, 3 day old grease?! Gross! I said ""wow, ok so Can I get my money back then?"" At this point I heard another woman's voice shout something. The manager I'm speaking with says ""shhh, she can hear you!"". I hear the other voice say something muffled followed by ""that b*tch on the phone""!!! She then comes back on the phone as if nothing happened. I told her I heard everything and I asked for her name as I was ready to call corporate at this point. I was respectful until I was called a b*tch. She hung up without telling me her name. I called back and asked a server. So, to Brooke the manager at this location, congratulations. You run a horrible, ghetto business and judging by the other reviews, it looks like you already are aware of this fact. Patrons: save your hard earned money, hit up granite city next door or go to a different location if you want TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Jeremy R.,"Waterford, MI",64,209,245,3.0,5/24/2017,"Much like other visits here and other TGI Fridays in the area - the service leaves a lot to be desired. The unlimited apps drew us in, but most of the food came out wrong. We also had to wait for refills and when the refills came out, the drink was usually wrong. The waitress ran a gift card and I still owed $15 - she never came back to get the rest of the money. Luckily I had some extra cash to leave behind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Janice W.,"Clawson, MI",6,6,,1.0,9/13/2017,"Went there tonight for my birthday; very disappointed, waited and waited for someone to seat us! Second worst Rib dinner ever: tough, hard to cut and very little meat on them! My husbands salmon dinner too salty, pilaf rice was not rice pilaf, spinach salty, worst Cole slaw ever, only thing good was the fries! Service not good either, my husband is a good tipper, but left less than 15%!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Devon M.,"Katy, TX",33,22,64,3.0,2/19/2017,"Waitress was nice. Convenient next to the hotel so you don't have to walk outside when you're traveling alone. Food was good and fairly priced. I'm just not a fan of this chain. Something about the cleanliness I never trust but I should not judge this location on other experiences. Food was good, service was good. I gave three stars because the menu is underwhelming. I couldn't have ordered more basic items because specialty ones where not appealing and seem to be the same as it was 15 years ago when I started eating at the one in Katy, TX.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Lisa M.,"Detroit, MI",0,5,1,2.0,11/13/2017,I really tried. I swear I did. I've been to the Southfield and Dearborn locations they were bad so I figured I'd try Troy maybe they could bring me back on team Fridays. Horribly disappointed! From the service to the small portion size they tried to sell me. The Katt Williams behind the bar (Jay) needs to take a serving class. He didn't smile not once. Didn't check on us had to ask other workers (Destiny) floating around for help. Only thing he had a sense of urgency for was to bring the check.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Kelsey P.,"Royal Oak, MI",554,5,,1.0,5/19/2017,"We came in and were seated and our orders were taken quickly. We got a nachos appetizer to share and I found a hair on the dip that was on one of the chips. Then my sister found another hair in her soup. Waitress hardly stopped to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything. We also noticed little fruit flies that would periodically fly around our food and faces, which then my sister pointed out fruit flies all over the wall above our booth. Disgusting. The waitress forgot to bring a box for our leftovers, but it was for the best since most of it was inedible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Jameson J.,"Westland, MI",57,113,219,3.0,2/6/2016,"The best thing about this Fridays is that it's connected to the Drury Hotel and if you are staying there you can go to get a convenient drink or desert quickly. The food here is typical Fridays ""nothing special"" I stick to the same things Jack Daniels wings cheese sticks and burgers and fries.  The major complaint I have about this place is that as soon as you walk into the bar area there is an odor. But oh well I wanted a drink so I ordered it and I have to say that the top shelf Long Island sub Lemonade for sour was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3
Melissa M.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",0,1,,5.0,2/27/2017,"A small group of us came to this facility on 2/26/17 for our friends birthday! Inside of the first 20 minutes was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant! HOWEVER, Steve the manager did an AMAZING job at fixing the issues! He went above and beyond the call of duty! Steve is an asset and a blessing to the Friday's corporation! His Hostess Tori, also went above and beyond her call of duty to ensure our visit was pleasurable! In the end our group had a GREAT visit! We look forward to returning very soon, without Steve & Tori I don't know that I would return! Steve,  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your diligent work and all your efforts!

Jason C.,"Rochester, MI",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2016,"Went here on a Friday night with my wife and son.  The wife and sons food was great, i however ordered a medium cooked steak, which showed up raw, not rare. Raw.  I had to send it back. I waited around 45 minutes and what was brought to me as a replacement can only be described as several burnt chunks of meat.

However on every table in the dinning room  there's a drink flyer and it did say Every Hour All Day Everyday Happy Hour. My wife asked about a drink that was on the flyer.

Carlos B.,"Troy, MI",38,10,7,2.0,3/26/2017,Service has gone way down. The staff there has really shifted. This used to be a great place with great service. Food has always been just ok but it lacked in quality it made up in customer service. Not any more. If you want to go and wait and wait for everything. Then dine here. I usually don't write bad reviews on a one time trip but these last few times have been horrible. Going to find a new Fridays to go to.

There was a waitress that was our regular girl, but sadly she has moved on :( - anyways back to reviews. I've always had good experience here.

No, it's not gourmet.  No, it's not ""fine dining"". It's a TGI Fridays, for the love of all that's good and holy in the world.

Jeff S.,"Birmingham, MI",2,19,,4.0,11/29/2015,"I have a rule: I avoid national chain restaurants unless I'm desperate. Late Sunday evening, I was hungry and desperate. My prior experiences with this chain were ""so-so"" on the food. Here, I had a great meal with great service. I had a buffalo wings appetizer that had excellent flavor and it was cooked just right. I ordered the Mahi Mahi and it was almost blackened with light fluffy texture. The spice and flavor was very good. One of my sides was the spinach. It's worth mentioning that the spinach was very well prepared. Sometimes these places just serve dry veggies. The spinach was not overcooked and served very hot with a mozzarella and grilled mushroom onions and some garlic.

Graziano M.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,9,4,1.0,7/22/2015,"Drinks took forever to come. We saw other people get drinks before us, as we were there before. Food also took a long time as the restaurant had like 12 people max on Sunday night. Food was ok. Could've been better. We've been coming for years and maybe it's time for a change. Waiter was really off and would help other people before us. Never checked if we needed refills or anything, and also told the waiter we were dissatisfied with the service as we are regulars. All he said was ""oh sorry"" ""let me process the payment"". No manager to speak to us or anything. Like I said every other time we have came, great service, mostly will not be returning, probably go to somewhere, where we are treated with respect and not another cash object.

Stephen H.,"Royal Oak, MI",50,472,190,3.0,5/9/2014,"So, I haven't dreamed of going in to a Fridays and haven't been in one and years as the chain has seen competition of some of the newer bigger and hipper chains like Bahama breeze, PF Changs and Carrabas. I'm generally not a fan of the big chains. Dropped in yesterday for a friends birthday. Wasn't terribly impressed with the menu but I bit the bullet and ordered the flank steak. My parties ordered the Jack Daniels chicken and the Rib Eye. I had samples of each item. I have to admit, the food was not bad. Service was ok. No real complaints at all.

This TGIF is attached to a Drury inn hotel of which I was staying I was in the mood for a quick drink around 9:00pm and stopped by, The hostess was talking with someone and it took forever to get her attention, finally she walked over I asked for a quiet spot as it was just myself and I wanted to make some phone calls. I don't think she understood this and put me right by the door WTF? My server Theo was awesome super nice and knowledgeable the only reason I am giving this place 3 stars. That being said he was swamped he literally had to service an entire room by himself including a large birthday party. I ordered a mixed drink Top shelf and it was pretty good nothing special. I think the biggest problem with this TGIF is management and they keep the place understaffed.  Expect slow service (which seems to be an ongoing trend at more and more TGIF) and expect your typical menu nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-troy-3?start=40

I order a steak (medium) with Parmesan fries and shrimp. The service was epically slow which was surprising because they were dead at 2 in the afternoon. My steak came out just shy of well done but I ate it anyway. The fries were soggy ( I think there was 5 of them...). The shrimp (5 as well) were tasty I suppose but didn't make up for the soggy fries and bad service. The waiter was a real weirdo and tried to talk my coworker out of what he ordered for some reason.

Erik M.,"Rochester Hills, MI",87,118,45,4.0,2/27/2010,"Somehow, and I don't know how, this place has become my friends' favorite bar to go to after work. Caveat: I have never eaten in the dining room of this place, just the bar side. For a chain restaurant, this TGI Fridays has a lot of charm. I've been coming here for almost two years to bitch and moan with my friends about the daily grind, and the staff has come to know us all by name. Nick the bartender and I have had many fun nights, one fueled by my having too much tequila and therefore him being my ""new best friend."" They have a late happy hour which runs from 9-12 featuring drink specials (like $4 Long Islands) and half-off selected appetizers. The boneless buffalo wings are really good and so is the Jack Daniels version. They luckily got rid of Guy Fieri and all his god-awful ""fusion"" foods and went back to basics.  The music at this place is surprisingly decent. The jukebox is devoid of the old annoying standards like Journey and Bon Jovi and it rather place indie-esque music. But make no mistake, it's one of those internet jukeboxes, so if some slob is intent on giving love a bad name, you're gonna hear it. We've had a few non-official work parties here and they were very accommodating to our very large group when we called ahead. Oh, and they have stupid junk on the walls, but that's to be expected.

Well when she started telling us ""you need to pay the bill right now and leave"" we told her we need at least ten seconds to sort out the money. She looked at us again and said ""if you don't pay right now I'm calling the cops"" Then I told her go ahead call the cops, she looked at me and said ""don't make me call Mario on you"" Then she did she was trying to intimate me and the people I was with. So then he came we talked to him and sorted everything out. So then I called today to leave a complaint and Victoria picked up the phone and we told her we had an incident last night and we want to let someone know about it, so then she lied and said I wasn't here last night.

I don't know what it is about them, and they are quite pricey, but nothing beats 1 or 2 of their ultimate long islands some nights.   I think this location is quite unique too, it's a Fridays that's attached to a hotel, so you get a good amount of out of town crowds on any given night, and it's also in the middle of what I call corporate row on big beaver, so you get your 9-5 after work crowd in there too. It makes for  great people watching, and it can get quite interesting there some nights. If you make it during their happy hour, you get half off most drinks, and half off most appetizers, they also have a late night happy hour.

I let her know and she brought it out none to speedily. It was just a super mediocre meal. Mediocre food, mediocre service. Don't waste your money here.

Thought to myself, no biggie a couple dollars over -- I should have looked before signing. Now after reviewing the receipts from my business travel it turns out I signed for $29.04 on a $24.04 bill (i tipped him a generous 20%) but he ran my card for more than the miscalculated bill was to begin with!

Craig M.,"Macomb, MI",52,123,110,1.0,3/23/2009,"Not my choice... With the wealth of great restaurants in the area, I was instructed to meet at TGI Fridays in Troy.  In spite of my misgivings, I consented and assumed that Fridays could deliver a 2-star performance and perhaps exceed my expectations with a 3-star.  You know what they say about people who assume...  This was perhaps the worst, allegedly professionally prepared, meal of my life. I ordered the Jack Daniel's Glazed Baby Back Ribs. Tender ribs prepared with an award winning Jack Daniel's BBQ Sauce. Sounded good, right?  Wrong... these ribs had no meat. Just cartilage connecting the bones which a steak knife had trouble with. My Med-School Daughter said she had seen meatier bones on 80 year old cadavers. Now that's an image I'll not soon forget.  So after 6 months of Yelping, I pop out my first two 1-Star reviews on the same weekend. Bad luck you say?  Well, I think it's Karma evening the score for the awesome NCAA Basketball Tournament bracket I picked this year.

We must have made it before the lunch rush (or slightly after they opened) because the place was just about empty. We were warmly greeted and (of course) seated immediately. *Bonus points for taking us to a booth without even asking! Our server (Curtiss) was there within moments to take our drink order, saw the coupon I had set on the table, and made mention of it. *Bonus points for that, because I am always afraid they don't see it, or because I hate having to point it out. My appetizer question was answered quickly and to my satisfaction. Our orders were taken quickly and our waiter made nice small talk--it didn't feel too much or too forced, so that was nice. Our food came out quickly, our drinks were refilled without asking, and our bill also came quickly. Our server made sure to mention TGIF's new loyalty program which I definitely would have appreciated had I not already been a member (but I'd much rather have them mention it than not, seeing as how I lost out on mucho rewards from Babies R Us, but that's in another review). The food we had was good--served quickly and what was supposed to be hot was hot, and was supposed to be cold...was cold. Neither my husband nor I had any complaints about the taste or quality of the food (we had the Parmesan-Crusted Sicilian Quesadillas for an appetizer, my husband had the Fish Tacos, and I had the Chicken Tostada Salad).

The service, on the other hand, was lackluster.  The seating hostess was telling us all about the specialties, yet couldn't answer a single question about ANYTHING.  One time we had a server who was late to greet us (we had already decided what we were going to order) and practically ignored us the whole time.

The waiter was kind but was trying way too hard to upsell us to some appetizer program...the whole time we were shaking our heads no thanks we just want drinks! It felt like hours before I got my first sip (you know how it is after work). Anyway it took forever...and when we were waiting they seated at least 3 tables who were waiting just as long as we were. One couple actually walked out they were so fed up with the service.

Urs M.,"Jacksonville, NC",282,234,1579,3.0,5/13/2015,"While traveling, I ended up at Fridays one night thanks to the coaxing of my colleagues. It was attached to the hotel we were staying at and the smells coming from the place were nice, so I thought why not? Had ribs with a ribeye and some garlic parm wedges and they were loooovely. Wonderful. So good. I went back another night. What happened?? The wedges were dryyyyyyy. I drank all of my water and then some trying to choke down those potatoes which was a shame because the flavour was amazing. The ribs were kinda funky. A little on the tough side which turned me off. The ribeye was still good, though. The bartender was really nice. He was super knowledgeable about the menu and what went with certain drinks. He made me something called a Junebug. It was green and delicious. Sweet, sour, and fruity. I don't care for desserts, but I tried a whiskey brownie... It was lacking a lot of whiskey and a lot of brownie. It was mostly whipped cream. The only problem is I think the restaurant relies a lot on the fact that it's attached to a hotel to keep it going. One night I wondered in and I didn't feel like sitting at the bar. There was no one at the podium to seat me. Servers walked by, smiled, and did nothing else. Didn't even tell anyone that there was a bunch of other confused-looking people were wandering about. A waitress walked by, so of course we asked her when someone would come to seat us. She got a little snappy and said that there would be no one and that we could only order take-out.

I was with another party.  Instead of asking how the bills would be split, the waitress came up with her own way of distributing the food, with which confusion ensued.

It all started when we were approached by server Amanda to take our order. After taking our order, Amanda disappeared. Another waitress named Marilyn came over with my soup and my husband's salad. My husband has Celiac disease so we specifically requested NO CROUTONS on his salad. Low and behold, Marilyn brought his salad out with chopped up croutons that blended in the salad. My husband ate a fork full of the salad and realized that it had croutons. We told Marilyn what happened because our original waitress Amanda was no where to be found. Marilyn took the salad off the table and walked away without a single word! It took another 20 min to get a different salad. I told Marilyn the severity of the mistake they made and she did not seem to care one little bit. After eating our meals, we requested the bill. My husband began to have horrible stomach pains d/t the croutons, so I decided to leave quickly instead of speaking with the manager about my horrible experience. Marilyn brought out the wrong bill. After 10 more minutes, we finally received the bill. Marilyn seemed very passive aggressive and uncaring when I told her that my husband's stomach was hurting d/t the croutons.

So you would think the ""chef"" would have enough time to put the love in their food. I was wrong. I'm a huge salad girl, I always get salads added as a side. I got the Bleu cheese wedge. This is the only salad I have never finished in my life. They put so much dressing on it that it was inedible. You really have to be a bad cook if you can't even get a salad right. I got the Jack Daniels glazed steak, wanted medium rare, it came out medium, almost medium well. The only reason I didn't send it back is because the glaze was so delicious and put a nice char on the steak, so either way I think it would have seemed over cooked for my liking. Then last thing! Seasoned fries I thought were supposed to be seasoned! I had to put pepper and salt on them. A bunch. I'm very sensitive to salt, so I hardly use a salt grinder. My sister got the pecan encrusted chicken salad. Too much dressing on that and the chicken was overcooked and dry. Waitress forgot two times about our 20% off coupon, and when I reminded her after she already printed off the bill, she made it seem as if she didn't even know about it.
