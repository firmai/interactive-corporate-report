561,Shari M.,"Jersey City, United States",9,19,24.0,3.0,2015-04-12,"Attended their first day opening practice/training session where management uses the time to train staff. The decor is beautiful, more modern than a few of the Cheesecake Factory's ive been to which is a plus because some look dated. The music played was nice, Selena Gomez, India Aire, Adele so it was a mix of r&b and pop with the occasional Christmas song as it is December. My server was Tey. He was handsome and kind but spoke way too low. I could hardly hear him sitting a few inches away from him. His trainer Grecia was awesome. She was kind, attentive and cheerful. It's nice to be served by someone who knows their stuff. The session included a complimentary beverage, a shared appetizer, entree and shared desert. For drinks I had a Blueberry Mojito, it wasn't to berry-y or minty. It was the perfect blend and refreshing. My mom had a glass of moscato and they're not stingy with the pour. The appetizer we chose was the fried chicken sliders, they were huge! and spicy. My entree was the fettuccini Alfredo which I didn't like. the noodles were tooo chewy and the sauce was underseasoned. My mom had the everything pizza pie which she enjoyed. it had pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach and something else i can't recall. On the the cheesecake which is always the best part. The Dulce De Leche caramel cheesecake was delicious. It's really sweet so it may be too sweet for some but it was perfect for me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

558,Dan G.,"Clifton, United States",1,6,,5.0,2015-09-12,I worked at cheesecake factory for several years in college. I can say first hand from seeing the behind the scenes at several restaurants that the cheesecake factory is top quality. The restaurant has very high standards for the quality of their food and service. The food is all prepared fresh daily along with fresh fish. The sauces are prepared to order. The dressings are made from scratch. It is all delicious. My favorite thing is the variety. There are over 250 items on the menu including skinilicious items and vegatarian items. Do not be turned off by the wait- there is a reason for it. The food is great and they try their best to not send food to the table that is not up to their standards. I've personally seen a manager try a sauce for a dish and make the kitchen remake the whole thing. The manager chose to make the guest wait for a quality product and even bought them dessert after explaining why they were making them wait. Just a note... don't order brown bread or pumpernickel...it's whole wheat!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548

276,Stefano T.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,43,13.0,2.0,2015-12-14,"Went there yesterday. Had a 50 minute wait for a table, it was pretty busy but we did see tables that were free but just not being flipped quickly enough. When we eventually got seated, our server was nice and took drinks/food order, the drinks took a fair amount of time to be brought to the table and the order was not complete. Probably took around 20-30 minutes to receive complete drinks order. Appetizers took around 30-40 minutes to be brought up, we had literally just finished our Apps when they brought the entree's up. The app plates had not even been cleared, the entree orders were wrong (One contained meat for a vegetarian...Even though we made it absolutely clear that the order should not contain meat) for two of the party and one was sent back completely. I just lived with the mistake on mine as i did not want to wait an eternity for it to be changed. One of the managers came over and comp'd one app and took the entree off the bill that had to be sent back due to length of time it took to receive the food and then the lack of break between courses. I get that this place is new and they are ironing out the kinks but we were hearing that other tables were being comp'd food due to the wait times. There are a ton of staff working at the restaurant but there just seems to be a lack of direction for them...Maybe management needs to step in more and direct as it seems that no one seems to know what they are doing there. Will try again in a few weeks and hopefully they have sorted their issues out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.568,2.72

Had a 50 minute wait for a table, it was pretty busy but we did see tables that were free but just not being flipped quickly enough. When we eventually got seated, our server was nice and took drinks/food order, the drinks took a fair amount of time to be brought to the table and the order was not complete. Probably took around 20-30 minutes to receive complete drinks order. Appetizers took around 30-40 minutes to be brought up, we had literally just finished our Apps when they brought the entree's up. The app plates had not even been cleared, the entree orders were wrong (One contained meat for a vegetarian...Even though we made it absolutely clear that the order should not contain meat) for two of the party and one was sent back completely. I just lived with the mistake on mine as i did not want to wait an eternity for it to be changed. One of the managers came over and comp'd one app and took the entree off the bill that had to be sent back due to length of time it took to receive the food and then the lack of break between courses. I get that this place is new and they are ironing out the kinks but we were hearing that other tables were being comp'd food due to the wait times. There are a ton of staff working at the restaurant but there just seems to be a lack of direction for them...Maybe management needs to step in more and direct as it seems that no one seems to know what they are doing there. Will try again in a few weeks and hopefully they have sorted their issues out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.504,2.44

Soo sorry!! No prob.....salad is completed with more dressing and yummy just like always.  just like all other visits to other locations (I travel for a living so).   Ordered a tasty farfalle cream chicken and roasted garlic dish.  So tasty.   Sadly it was WAY short on the chicken.  Not sure if this is corporate policy or new mgmt trying to impress corporate.  We left here in November and are back now for our season.  This location has opened since we left and WE were exited to try out the new spot as we  love the experience most always  elsewhere.  So indeed a few more times at this location (2min walk from marina) will be in order.  Usually newly opened restaurants don't hold back on the ingredients hope this is just an off night.  Love this place usually    Fire and oak has been our go to for 10 years now.  Just saying.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8560000000000003,3.2800000000000002

Hubby: A glass of water and a Mac n' cheese burger with fries. After about 10 mins. of waiting, our waitress returned and informed us that they ran out of Mac n' cheese. Huh?!  She suggested that we look at the menu again to order something else but we decided to leave and eat somewhere else after she charged us for two sodas and we only had one.

Came by a few weeks ago with some of my favorite amigos and must say we left super full and satisfied.  We had about a 10 minute wait before being seated which was a little confusing because it was 2pm on a week day and it wasn't a full restaurant. We finally sat at a booth really enjoyed that you can look right into the kitchen as they are busy preparing peoples meals. We were greeted by our waiter who seemed nice.  We orders some apps and cocktails everything came out pretty good. We waiting a while for our food but at this point we really should have just stopped at apps because we were pretty full.  Service was okay nothing majorly great about it. I would definitely come back if I was in the mood for a chain restaurant.

408,Briana C.,"Jersey City, United States",149,94,261.0,3.0,2016-03-12,"Food was good as per usual for this restaurant chain. However hostess service was not only slow but incompetent. They gave us a buzzer for a legit two min wait. Then they brought us to two tables that were 1) occupied and 2) not yet cleaned. Before actually being able to seat us. They hostess was unapologetic and made us walk all the way back to the hostess station (past plenty of open/clean tables). When they finally sat us the floor was filthy and table was sticky. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 130 and the place was not exceptionally crowded at all. The family who eventually was seated next to us had a baby and requested a booth which they did not give them. The mom was requesting a booth and the hostess told them they would have to go back and wait again even though the booth across from us was open. Then proceeded to take 15 min to bring them a height chair. The only reason this location didn't get one star was because we had James m. as our server and he made up for the lack of customer service the rest of the team presented with. He was friendly , timely and out order came out exactly as expected. If it wasn't for him our experience would have been regretful.

363,Michelle O.,"Jersey City, United States",9,119,426.0,3.0,2016-03-12,"This place is always packed! 30 minutes wait for a table for 2 on Saturday at 7:30pm. They hand out buzzers so you can shop around while waiting for the table. Free bread: nice and warm! Whole wheat and white. Chicken Madeira: chicken, melted cheese, asparagus and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Comes with mashed potatoes. It's pretty good, although I felt the wine sauce was a little too sweet. Louisiana style chicken and pasta: Parmesan crusted chicken over bow tie pasta. The chicken was super crispy and great, but the pasta was bland. This dish showed up as the #1 dish to order in Cheesecake Factory in my research. I was surprised when it didn't turn out as good.  Tiramisu cheesecake: when tiramisu and cheesecake married and had a child, this is it. Coffee-soaked lady finger bottoms, mascarpone-cheesecake filling and topped with a layer of chocolate powdered mascarpone cream. My only small complaint is the chocolate cream swirl is too sweet (you can remove it if u want - it's not mixed into the cake). Our 2 entrees could probably feed 3. We brought home leftovers. Our bill was $46. They are running a promo now where if you purchase a $25 gift card, you get a free slice of cake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=20,3.4,3.29,3.29,2.668,3.334

Once we were seated we were greeted immediately and everything from there went smoothly. I enjoyed the calamari and the large portion of buffalo blast. I loved the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta.

443,Victoria C.,"New York, United States",330,90,173.0,4.0,2016-03-30,"Food: B The food here was awesome mostly. We started with the Fried Calamari, and it came with both a garlic aioli and cocktail sauce - super tasty - and I noticed that the squid was very tender. Every time I order fried calamari, it's usually quite tough - it was ~delish~ here. The aioli, I think, consisted mainly of mayo - not complaining about, since it was SO good - but I wish it had been lighter so I didn't immediately feel my arteries clog up after taking one bite. Would have loved to eat more of it. The cocktail sauce was a more refreshing alternative. I actually really enjoy fried calamari with marinara sauce, though, so I wish that they had provided that as well. For our entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio and the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo. The chicken dish was a breaded chicken breast over angel hair pasta (with a light pesto?) topped with prosciutto and arugula. My boyfriend loved it, and it came in a large portion. He has a good appetite and didn't finish it. Can't say the same about my combo dish, which also came with (a small amount of) mashed potatoes. It wasn't a huge problem for me since I still barely finished it - I was so full from the bread, appetizer and also barely touched the side of fries that I ordered (so unlike me). The presentation of this dish wasn't impressive, since the portions were small and it was spaced out over such a large dish. But the shrimp scampi was cooked very well - the sauce was absolutely delicious. Gotta warn you though, if garlic isn't your thing, I wouldn't get the shrimp scampi. Luckily, I LOVE garlic. As for the salmon, meh - overcooked IMO. I like my salmon with the center still a bit tender/soft, but it was tough/crumbly. The ""herb crusted"" part apparently just meant that some herbs were thrown on top of it. It just didn't look (or taste) that appetizing. A bit disappointing. After dinner, we ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse cheesecake to share, which we've had before, and it was super rich and chocolatey. It was very heavy, so I would recommend ordering a tall glass of milk or something on the side. I could barely eat any since I was so full already, but I really wish I could have eaten more of it. Service: A The service here was great - our waitress was very friendly but not intrusive. She was patient when we needed some time to look at the menu, and she was also good with timing - how much time we needed to look at the menu, when to space out our bread, appetizer, and entrees, etc. Our wine was taking a bit due to a backup at the bar, so she was kind enough to give us a heads up so we weren't left wondering if it was forgotten. She checked up on us to see how our food was after giving us enough time to actually eat a bit (some waiters ask only a moment after setting the food down, and I'm like...I've barely touched my food yet...) Timing is a huge thing when it comes to waiting tables. Good timing makes the patrons feel comfortable, relaxed and able to enjoy their meal; poor timing gives customers an experience where they feel rushed, impatient, and/or uncomfortable or even frustrated. I distinctly noticed that she was very good at her job. Ambiance: B This Cheesecake Factory is a part of the Newport Mall. We were seated in the ""patio"" area, outside the restaurant but inside the halls of the mall. They made sure to ask to make sure it was okay to be seated here. Seems weird since people shopping at the mall walk past you, but it wasn't that bad. I actually thought that we had a bit more privacy here than we would have inside, where it was super busy. I was a little concerned that because we were kind of separate from the rest of the tables, we would be forgotten (it happens) and the waitress would busy herself with the customers in the main area, but it was totally fine - our waitress was very attentive :) *thumbs up* A heads up, the patio area has patio furniture (wrought iron tables and all weather wicker sofas to sit on which was comfortable). Not everyone's cup of tea - some people might like the ""fancier"" vibe inside, but this was totally fine for us, even better since it was quieter and we could have a conversation. Other (Sanitation): C When we were seated, we saw that the table had not been cleaned properly - grease marks all over. After I asked our waitress about it, she sent someone over to wipe it, and the guy apologized. Understandable since the metal that the table was made of made it hard to see whether it was a grease mark or drying water. But what was annoying after that, though, was that they later gave us spoons for our cheesecake (dessert after our meal) that were also not very clean. Both my boyfriend and I took a look at our respective spoons and dipped them into a water glass and wiped them down before we felt comfortable enough to use them... Not ideal, especially after already giving us a table that hadn't been cleaned properly *thumbs down* Overall, I had a great time here and would come back! :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=140,2.76,3.23,3.23,2.6079999999999997,3.042

114,Greg C.,"South Orange, NJ",465,332,624.0,3.0,2016-04-11,"Food, 5 Stars Value, 5 Stars Ambiance, 4 Stars Service, 2 Stars I think the reputation of Cheesecake Factory is well established.  The food is consistently good, and the portions are big for the price.  We were very happy when this store opened in our neighborhood.  We finally had a chance to try it out for an early dinner on Saturday, with 7 family members. The service was so slow and inattentive it was a bit annoying, and I'm generally a fairly patient person.  The restaurant was pretty crowded, but they seemed to have enough staff to handle the tables, and then some, as there seemed to be servers and runners milling about all over the place.  It took about 15 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, and then another 15 before he brought the drinks and took our food order.  He forgot one of our appetizers.  Also, the food came out at different times, which should never happen at a restaurant.  When we did need something, our server often came to take orders from neighboring tables without ever looking our way.  I have worked as a server and bartender, so I know, you never come onto the floor without giving a quick glance to all of your tables to see if someone is trying to flag you down.  It is really frustrating when you are waving your arms and the server never even looks your way.  Why do I have to yell across the restaurant?  Clearly they were not that interested in seating the growing crowd of people in their lobby, because I even had to get up and go hand him my credit card personally, because I wasn't sure if he was ever going to come pick it up. The food was all very good (except the appetizer we never got...at least he remembered to take it off the check).  Hopefully this was an isolated incident and they will get their act together, because we do enjoy their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=120,2.92,3.28,3.28,2.54,3.136

It's ridiculous how little alcohol it takes to give me a nice buzz.  Finishing a single drink is hard for me to do.  I downed a huge Caribbean style drink and didn't feel a thing, which means only one thing .... their drinks have hardly any alcohol in them.  So we finally order dinner.  I had a craving for the fish & chips.  It was so greasy I couldn't eat it.  What's worse is that when I brought it home my pets wouldn't touch it either.  It came with fries (which I normally don't eat) but since I wasn't eating that fish, I tried a couple.  They were also greasy and tasted just like fish.  It turns out they cook the fish and the fries in the same oil.  In short, it was a big waste of time and money.  I was very disappointed.

Second, service was atrocious. First waitress told me ""beers are $4."" ""Any of the beers here?"" ""Yes"" ""four dollars?"" ""Yes"". Later check comes and price was $7-9 dollars each. The best part was the joker manager: ""sorry for the misinformation"" ""so what are we going to do about it?"" ""Sorry can't do anything"". ""Ok whatever"". It's one of those places where you might hear ""sorry I don't know. I just work here."" Interestingly, 2 min later our second waitress brings a check that has at least some adjustment to the price (She is great. Thank you).

The ambiance is like its other locations, very cozy and intimate.  It does get crowded and you might be waiting some time for a table during peek dining hours.   The food is flavorful a little on the pricey side but it's a better option then most chain restaurants if u don't feel like cooking.  Don't forget to grab yourself a slice of cheesecake heaven.  I don't even like cheesecake or sweets like that but I tried a slice of the salted caramel cheesecake.  WOW!!!! It put me in another atmosphere the lady next to me was laughing Bc my eyes were rolling to the back of my head....yes that feeling!!!

It's ridiculous how little alcohol it takes to give me a nice buzz.  Finishing a single drink is hard for me to do.  I downed a huge Caribbean style drink and didn't feel a thing, which means only one thing .... their drinks have hardly any alcohol in them.  So we finally order dinner.  I had a craving for the fish & chips.  It was so greasy I couldn't eat it.  What's worse is that when I brought it home my pets wouldn't touch it either.  It came with fries (which I normally don't eat) but since I wasn't eating that fish, I tried a couple.  They were also greasy and tasted just like fish.  It turns out they cook the fish and the fries in the same oil.  In short, it was a big waste of time and money.  I was very disappointed. The waited was hard to get hold of, so I didn't bother complaining.  He didn't seem like he would care anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=200,3.04,2.81,3.024,2.6600000000000006,2.902

Buffalo chicken wings was the only decent dish. Second, service was atrocious. First waitress told me ""beers are $4."" ""Any of the beers here?"" ""Yes"" ""four dollars?"" ""Yes"". Later check comes and price was $7-9 dollars each. The best part was the joker manager: ""sorry for the misinformation"" ""so what are we going to do about it?"" ""Sorry can't do anything"". ""Ok whatever"". It's one of those places where you might hear ""sorry I don't know. I just work here."" Interestingly, 2 min later our second waitress brings a check that has at least some adjustment to the price (She is great. Thank you).

They also threw Parmesan on top of it which made the sogginess worse. For the entree I ordered the Luau Salad which did not taste fresh at all. The salad was wilted and soggy. They also put way too much dressing in the salad. The crisp part was drowning in dressing, which had a chemical taste. Nothing tastes fresh.

It wasn't so much the mediocre and overly sweet cheesecake but our waiter was terrible!!! Had to wait 20 mins for water while the cheesecake and macchiato already arrived. We were over it at this point but what was annoying was that he kept circling our table, clearly not busy and not bringing back our $10 change!!

We came saturday night and expected a long wait, which was fine, but then our buzzers rang and the girl in the front of the restaurant said we were ready, after telling us it's a 15 min wait. Then she told us it was a mistake and the table wasn't ready, which would've been nice to know before making us walk the whole way thru the restaurant.  Then our waiter came and took our orders but it took forever for him to come. I had to flag someone else down twice to get the waiter. I ordered a drink and he never delivered my drink. We ordered the hot cheese and spinach dip as the appetizer and it was great. I was then ready to order the main entree and it took him at least a half an hour to come. I ordered my entree (the farfalle with chicken and garlic) and it was very tasty. Had absolutely no complaints and the portion sizes were reasonable. I asked him again for my drink (Mai Tai margarita) and he said he would get it. Second time around, STILL no drink and I decided to just call it quits. Then when we were ready to pay, he did not come back until for another 15 minutes. We assumed to just pay one front register then, until the waiter FINALLY came and said ""where do you think you're going""? I told him we were going to pay in the front and he rudely said ""NO, YOU PAY ME!!"" Well, yes, but you never showed up, so we assumed you forgot, and were just going to go the register which was right next to our table.  Should not have even given him a 20% tip given his attitude and his ability to forget my Mai Tai cocktail TWICE. The service was terrible, and while the food was good, the service alone will not make us come back.

The service was so slow and inattentive it was a bit annoying, and I'm generally a fairly patient person.  The restaurant was pretty crowded, but they seemed to have enough staff to handle the tables, and then some, as there seemed to be servers and runners milling about all over the place.  It took about 15 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, and then another 15 before he brought the drinks and took our food order.  He forgot one of our appetizers.  Also, the food came out at different times, which should never happen at a restaurant.  When we did need something, our server often came to take orders from neighboring tables without ever looking our way.  I have worked as a server and bartender, so I know, you never come onto the floor without giving a quick glance to all of your tables to see if someone is trying to flag you down.  It is really frustrating when you are waving your arms and the server never even looks your way.  Why do I have to yell across the restaurant?  Clearly they were not that interested in seating the growing crowd of people in their lobby, because I even had to get up and go hand him my credit card personally, because I wasn't sure if he was ever going to come pick it up.

Chicken Madeira: chicken, melted cheese, asparagus and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Comes with mashed potatoes. It's pretty good, although I felt the wine sauce was a little too sweet. Louisiana style chicken and pasta: Parmesan crusted chicken over bow tie pasta. The chicken was super crispy and great, but the pasta was bland. This dish showed up as the #1 dish to order in Cheesecake Factory in my research. I was surprised when it didn't turn out as good.  Tiramisu cheesecake: when tiramisu and cheesecake married and had a child, this is it. Coffee-soaked lady finger bottoms, mascarpone-cheesecake filling and topped with a layer of chocolate powdered mascarpone cream. My only small complaint is the chocolate cream swirl is too sweet (you can remove it if u want - it's not mixed into the cake). Our 2 entrees could probably feed 3. We brought home leftovers.

They hostess was unapologetic and made us walk all the way back to the hostess station (past plenty of open/clean tables). When they finally sat us the floor was filthy and table was sticky. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 130 and the place was not exceptionally crowded at all. The family who eventually was seated next to us had a baby and requested a booth which they did not give them. The mom was requesting a booth and the hostess told them they would have to go back and wait again even though the booth across from us was open. Then proceeded to take 15 min to bring them a height chair. The only reason this location didn't get one star was because we had James m. as our server and he made up for the lack of customer service the rest of the team presented with.

I ordered my entree (the farfalle with chicken and garlic) and it was very tasty. Had absolutely no complaints and the portion sizes were reasonable. I asked him again for my drink (Mai Tai margarita) and he said he would get it. Second time around, STILL no drink and I decided to just call it quits. Then when we were ready to pay, he did not come back until for another 15 minutes. We assumed to just pay one front register then, until the waiter FINALLY came and said ""where do you think you're going""? I told him we were going to pay in the front and he rudely said ""NO, YOU PAY ME!!"" Well, yes, but you never showed up, so we assumed you forgot, and were just going to go the register which was right next to our table.

Tuscan Chicken - 3/5          It has very small pieces of chicken breast and the plate was covered in oil and lemon juice. Not at all tasty. It says it is a skinnilicious dish but I can see hell lot of calories. Overall the experience of cheesecake factory here in  the mall is very bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=20,2.88,2.85,2.908,1.864,2.862

The order took 35 minutes for two dishes !!! How much time does it take to make Spicy Chicken over rice fellas ?????  They say the dish took longer than usual to make. After 35 min, all We got was cold food. They have no explanation to that. It only means that the food was ready sometime back and they didn't get it to the table. The food was taken back to kitchen and when the re-served one dish had too much salt in it. By then our appetite was over and we got food packed cuz we couldn't eat. They sent their manager to talk to us who turned out to be another waiter.  Bunch of a**holes and liars work here. The whole management & staff needs to be 'fired'. Even after all this, I had to PAY for the late food !!  We are never coming back. And neither We will recommend this place to anyone. There is a reason why this place got 2.5 star as compared to other cheesecake factories. Re-Edit after reading other reviews-- Cheesecake Factory Guest Services !

I almost always get the spicy chipotle chicken sandwich with a side of fries which never ever disappoints. The shrimp scampi is pretty good as well. I recently had the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus and it was so good. Finish off the meal with one of their amazing cheesecake and you'll be a satisfied customer.

189,G E.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,5,,1.0,2017-04-10,"The service and management at this Cheesecake Factory located in Newport Mall, Jersey City has gone from poor to terrible. The first time I ever made an attempt to visit was shortly after they opened 2 years ago. I loved the establishment in other locations, and was always pleased with the Miso Salmon dish for nearly 16 years without a problem. I tried to pick up an order at the Newport Mall location shortly after they opened and they kept me on hold for 15-20 minutes or more (sounds unbelievable right...yeah I know, I couldn't believe it either). After all that hold time they still never took my order. I hung up the phone and opted for another restaurant   The last time I visited was last year. I ordered salmon that tasted somewhat like old fish, it was so bad I actually couldn't eat it and had to send it back (something I really hate to do). I then asked for chicken and biscuits as a substitute and they told me it was sold out.   Tonight I went back. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (with no one ahead of us) even though there were empty seats and I was told our wait would be short. Staff was nonchalant about clearing and cleaning the tables that were recently vacated by previous patrons.    I proceeded to the men's restroom once we were seated, and to my surprise there was absolutely no hand soap! I asked staff could i get some soap. After 5 minutes of waiting near the restroom for soap, I saw staff approach the manager who gave a nonchalant gesture toward my direction. Staff then gave a shameful look in my direction and went back to preparing tables. I waited another couple of minutes and approached the same staff, who then went on another search. This time the hostess went to the restroom to check. When she came out of the women's room without soap I asked her for soap. She said ok. Then the manager who wouldn't move to help me before finally comes in my direction to apologize. He blamed the lack of soap on the mall being closed at the time and said they're waiting for a shipment. I didn't believe him. Needless to say, a restaurant should always have soap in the restroom at all times, otherwise the restaurant itself should be closed.    Another 2-3 minutes later the manager comes back with soap from the kitchen. I waited for soap so long until my sister who accompanied me thought something bad possibly happened and told my son to check on me.   I ordered chicken and biscuits. The waitress was pleasant, but my chicken and mashed potatoes was lukewarm, and the biscuits were cold. I was afraid to send it back after the poor service I already received. I begrudgingly ate it with a resolve that I would never return to this establishment again.   This place is giving the Cheesecake Factory franchise a bad reputation. They really need to do something about this. If anyone wants to try Cheesecake Factory, don't go to the Newport Mall Jersey City location. Choose another location, or you might be as disappointed as I was and am now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=180,2.52,2.66,2.768,1.8600000000000003,2.604

28,DeShawn A.,"Las Vegas, NV",232,201,208.0,2.0,2017-06-08,I don't know what the deal is with the CCF! Came here since it was located across from the hotel I was staying at thinking it was a safe bet for good food! Well food was mediocre and service was even worse! Hostess acted as we weren't standing there and I had to ask if we could get a table.....no such luck as we were forced to sit at high table in the bar area. I asked if it was okay that I had a minor in my party and I was surprised when they said yes it was fine....Our server acted as if we were bothering her by being there! She hardly checked on us and by the time it was time to pay we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for her to come and process the check! My husband literally walked around the restaurant trying to locate her so we could pay! I give 2 stars for the so/so food! Plain awful! Glad I was just visiting and don't have to subject myself to this craziness!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=40,2.28,2.49,2.732,2.2800000000000002,2.406

We came here for lunch, and when dinner time came, despite not being hungry, we scrolled through Seamless for half an hour until we decided to order from the CF twice in one day. The food from this chain is alway decent but never exceeds expectations other than with its sheer portion size. The inaptly named Skinnylicious menu should just be the regular menu. Even the Superfoods section consists of dishes well over 1k calories. Flavorwise, both the vegan cobb and the salmon salad are tasty, and so is the free bread. My bf's buffalo cauliflower also smelled amazing.

What an embarrassment to my guests.  I made a reservation for 7 about 2 weeks ago, received  a conformation call about 4 days prior to us going.   On the day of... I called in to change the reservation to 6:30 from 6pm and  was told I was not in the book!. Explained I got a conformation call  how could i not be in the book...I was like ok, I  can let this pass..as long as they could seat myself and my guests. We get there and were seated in a booth clearly made for 4 people to be comfortable..we all squeezed in  and had one person sit with a chair at the end of the table.  The place wasn't super busy, I would of thought we have a comfortable place in the back ..but we dealt with it.  We ordered drinks and appetizers..appetizers came out  right away..the drinks about 20 minutes after. Then our waitress disappeared for over 10 minutes and we wanted to place our dinner orders. I had to flag another waitress to find her.  We were done with the appetizers and drinks and no one came back to the table to see if we wanted refills or more appetizers. Fast forward 45 minutes later...finally our dinner plates started showing up at the table 2 at a time. 1 person had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the Chicken & biscuits meal. At this point everyone was clearly aggravated. The manager came to our table once just to hand us our drinks from the bar..When we requested him to come to the table again he sent someone else. Long story short. 3 people had to send their dinner plates back, we barely saw our waitress  and the manager cowardly hid from us. What a way to ruin a Friday night celebration dinner.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=60,2.24,2.46,2.72,2.212,2.372

79,P S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,6,,1.0,2017-07-01,Firstly I love CF but today we had the worst experience at this location. Usually they accommodate us always. We requested a table which had reg chairs instead of the booth with leather couches because I had a back issue so couldn't sit on the leather couch. Plus we asked for a high chair. This was clearly explained to the manager at the front desk.after making us wait for 20 min they still give us the wrong table. When we requested a reg chair they denied us. They could not accommodate us at all anywhere in the entire restaurant and we had  to leave. They did not even consider accommodating. Not to mention the crying baby.  Really bad CF!!!! Really bad service!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=80,2.56,2.49,2.72,2.052,2.5180000000000002

Sounds so boring and simple but they actually where really good.  I enjoyed my entree as well as my husband.  Now let's get down to the cheesecakes OMG so many flavors so delicious. How can one control them selfs here.  I love cheese cake  We ordered 3 cheese cake to stay an a huge cake to go not realizing how much an how big of a portion they serve.

The server was super slow took him a while to take our order ,I had to wait over 30 min just for a glass of water, they never checked how's the food or if we need anything.

Service was prompt and friendly.  The place was busy and humming. We each had a cocktail and the pineapple moscow mule was quite good!  I ordered the Nashville hot chicken app and while it really was nothing like the hot chicken in Nashville, it was good.  We each had a salad, my MIL the chopped which was quite a generous portion and i had the seared tuna salad.  It was good, and not at all a large portion - just enough for lunch.  I will say that for the $19 price tag on this salad, it could have had more than 3 slices of the tuna but that would be my only complaint.   We were seated quickly, waited on promptly, with a waiter who was attentive and not distracting.

Returning food I never do but my chicken was raw and I refuse ! To get sick. The manager ran out and was very kind he had asked me if I wanted a Cheesecake ... I responded no thank you I just want my chicken madeira I was very hungry... 15 mins goes by ( thinking their remaking my meal) are waitress came back to us with the check telling me they removed the meal from are bill. My friend asked if they were bringing me a new one remind you I've been here for about a hour my fiancé and friend had ate while I still haven't had anything. She tells us she didn't know she would check I told her if it wasn't made I didn't want it anymore.

57,Sam K.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,91,20.0,3.0,2017-08-04,Like one of the earlier reviewers said- This place does give the Cheesecake Factory a bad name. Agreed this is in a mall and does get crowded most of the time over the weekends but when it's not- I don't understand what the strategy is in putting your customers on a waitlist despite having plenty of empty tables. The portions are big enough just like at any other Cheesecake Factory. Thrice I have been here and all the three times they got us the molasses(brown) bread late with the meal. Considering that the neighborhood(unless you travel to grove st.) is devoid of good ambience restaurants I might come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=20,2.72,2.5,2.68,2.604,2.588

I asked if it was okay that I had a minor in my party and I was surprised when they said yes it was fine....Our server acted as if we were bothering her by being there! She hardly checked on us and by the time it was time to pay we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for her to come and process the check!

525,G E.,"Jersey City, United States",0,5,,1.0,2017-10-04,"The service and management at this Cheesecake Factory located in Newport Mall, Jersey City has gone from poor to terrible. The first time I ever made an attempt to visit was shortly after they opened 2 years ago. I loved the establishment in other locations, and was always pleased with the Miso Salmon dish for nearly 16 years without a problem. I tried to pick up an order at the Newport Mall location shortly after they opened and they kept me on hold for 15-20 minutes or more (sounds unbelievable right...yeah I know, I couldn't believe it either). After all that hold time they still never took my order. I hung up the phone and opted for another restaurant   The last time I visited was last year. I ordered salmon that tasted somewhat like old fish, it was so bad I actually couldn't eat it and had to send it back (something I really hate to do). I then asked for chicken and biscuits as a substitute and they told me it was sold out.   Tonight I went back. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (with no one ahead of us) even though there were empty seats and I was told our wait would be short. Staff was nonchalant about clearing and cleaning the tables that were recently vacated by previous patrons.    I proceeded to the men's restroom once we were seated, and to my surprise there was absolutely no hand soap! I asked staff could i get some soap. After 5 minutes of waiting near the restroom for soap, I saw staff approach the manager who gave a nonchalant gesture toward my direction. Staff then gave a shameful look in my direction and went back to preparing tables. I waited another couple of minutes and approached the same staff, who then went on another search. This time the hostess went to the restroom to check. When she came out of the women's room without soap I asked her for soap. She said ok. Then the manager who wouldn't move to help me before finally comes in my direction to apologize. He blamed the lack of soap on the mall being closed at the time and said they're waiting for a shipment. I didn't believe him. Needless to say, a restaurant should always have soap in the restroom at all times, otherwise the restaurant itself should be closed.    Another 2-3 minutes later the manager comes back with soap from the kitchen. I waited for soap so long until my sister who accompanied me thought something bad possibly happened and told my son to check on me.   I ordered chicken and biscuits. The waitress was pleasant, but my chicken and mashed potatoes was lukewarm, and the biscuits were cold. I was afraid to send it back after the poor service I already received. I begrudgingly ate it with a resolve that I would never return to this establishment again.   This place is giving the Cheesecake Factory franchise a bad reputation. They really need to do something about this. If anyone wants to try Cheesecake Factory, don't go to the Newport Mall Jersey City location.

My first experience here was dine in, my date and I were seated promptly, waitress was very helpful and well mannered. As an appetizer, we chose the Tex Mex egg rolls.

I also opted for spaghettini instead of farfalle and my waiter graciously accepted my alterations. My date went for the chicken alfredo.

The food came fairly cold, there were still onions in mine, the shrimp was tough and cold, and they didn't put any pancetta in even though I didn't ask for that to be removed.

The fries were cold and the tomatoe was wilting/soggy. Not worth $100 bill. Bad service. It was not even half full and they gave us resistance to have a big table instead of being cramped into a small table. We are tall persons. It used to be good back in december; now very disappointing. There are also many children/teens causing great disturbance out side. Fighting and filming getting thrown out of the mall. Big embarassment to bring family and friends for an enjoyable meal. I wont go again. Thanks for the great december meals but now the cheese cake slices are geting very small as well.

I called in to change the reservation to 6:30 from 6pm and  was told I was not in the book!. Explained I got a conformation call  how could i not be in the book...I was like ok, I  can let this pass..as long as they could seat myself and my guests. We get there and were seated in a booth clearly made for 4 people to be comfortable..we all squeezed in  and had one person sit with a chair at the end of the table.  The place wasn't super busy, I would of thought we have a comfortable place in the back ..but we dealt with it.  We ordered drinks and appetizers..appetizers came out  right away..the drinks about 20 minutes after. Then our waitress disappeared for over 10 minutes and we wanted to place our dinner orders. I had to flag another waitress to find her.  We were done with the appetizers and drinks and no one came back to the table to see if we wanted refills or more appetizers. Fast forward 45 minutes later...finally our dinner plates started showing up at the table 2 at a time. 1 person had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the Chicken & biscuits meal. At this point everyone was clearly aggravated. The manager came to our table once just to hand us our drinks from the bar..When we requested him to come to the table again he sent someone else. Long story short. 3 people had to send their dinner plates back, we barely saw our waitress  and the manager cowardly hid from us.

The loaded potato ball things were so good as well as the flat bread pizza. Dinner my husband absolutely didn't enjoy his but they changed it out and he got a new dish (to go) by the time he got it. Mine and the kids were just fine. I got 2 cheesecakes to go and just had some today and a piece of paper or something was inside of it so I am not happy about that but not much I can do being it was to go and 2 days later.

The chicken taquitos were cold and tasteless with no hint of chicken in them.  Drinks: Absolutely watered down.
