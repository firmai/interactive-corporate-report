45,Frank L.,"Danvers, MA",18,27,2.0,2.0,2013-09-17,"Went in for lunch and got one of the signature combos with Oriental chicken salad and Blackened shrimp pasta. Not awful, not great just blah. The pasta was overcooked, the shrimp smelled and tasted of the freezer and the salad was ok but you could count the chicken pieces on it with one hand. For fuel it is OK but not up to par of other Applebees in my opinion.

36,Katherine R.,"Bedford, MA",0,8,,1.0,2014-02-26,Tired of being shorted. I love Applebee's white queso so I order some to go every few weeks to enjoy at home. Originally I was getting 4oz for my $1.50 - a great deal. But then it switched to 3oz. A bit disappointed but I understand the economy. The last few times I've gone however I've only gotten 2oz for my $1.50. They've basically secretly doubled the price and shorted me 9oz of what I've paid for. If they tried giving half a meal for full price they'd be in quite a bit of hot water but they seem to think this is acceptable behavior. Nope. Customer lost forever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003
34,Wendi X.,"Tewksbury, MA",3,103,6.0,1.0,2014-06-19,"The lay out of this restaurant is crazy..the front door is a good walk away from where you park the cars.. With that stated if you are handicapped or temporally handicapped (meaning being injured) do not come here...why you ask..let me explain..my husband was on crutches. We saw someone come out of a door where the ramp is where you would park for handicap and the call ahead pick up curb side food order. So, I go and drop off my husband here. Get him all and let him start to hobble to the door while i go and park the car. When I get to the ramp I find from him the door wont open. So, we kinda waited for someone to exit..mm no one...so I told him to stay so I would go in and go over to the door and go open it for him cause it was a very long way for him to hobble over to the front door.  When I get in there I get asked right away how many I told them the handicap door is wont open. There answer is this...ready...yes we know it is locked, we have to keep it locked..What???? That makes NO SENSE...So, why even have a handicap ramp..oh wait I get it.. So, you can give it an illusion that your legally following the laws and screw the actual handicap people... All I have to say is shame on you and I do hope one day that you have to be on crutches and you have to travel that lengthy parking lot.  As for the wait staff, she was friend and prompt in the beginning but no one came back and asked us is everything was ok... As for the food it was fair...very greasy fries & onion rings (which they forgot to included with the order), the burger was cold and over cooked/dry... Then to top it all off - we exited out of the handicap door cause that was allowed, but when I went to retrieve the car some friggen idiot keyed my car.. So, my black SUV had several deep marks all over my freshly painted passages doors.... mmm ya so I can tell you this..this was first and last time I will ever come here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

18,Justin N.,"Burlington, MA",0,7,,1.0,2014-12-05,"I'm done with this location, for good.  I'll start with the highlight: the manager is a pretty swell guy, and always makes things right. That's seriously the only compliment I can muster about this place. I grew up on Applebee's as a kid (and it shows), so when I moved into my current apartment and had this location up the road, I was thrilled: free Wi-Fi, decent food, acceptable prices...I thought it'd be a good hang out joint, like everywhere else I've lived.  I was wrong. In the few dozen times I've been here, I have: *Had a waiter ignore me for the better part of half an hour before the MANAGER took my drink order.  Yes, I mean actively ignore me, as in he gave me a look of disgust before passing by every single time. *Repeated orders have had ingredients missing, been dangerously undercooked (which resulted in not one, not two, but THREE DIFFERENT INCIDENTS of food poisoning between myself and my friends) or overcooked to a crisp *Bill has been wrong multiple times, including the most recent incident where the waitress swapped our bills despite our very clearly separating our cards and tabs (mine was pinned to the OUTSIDE of the billfold with a pen, his was wedged inside the billfold) *Serving sizes of the sides vary wildly; one day I had enough fries they covered my chicken, the next visit I had maybe twelve to fifteen individual fries in total *Staff attitudes vary wildly.  Some staff love me, know my order preferences, and get everything out piping hot and ready to go.  Others really just don't give a fudge and will let my food sit in the kitchen until it's ice cold, and have the audacity to cop an attitude when I call them on it. At this point, the location has become a joke between my friends and I.  We've all gotten sick from it, the food is barely passable by *Applebee's* standards (and that's saying a lot!), and the fact the manager has to make quarterly rounds to make sure -everything- is okay with -every- table just speaks to how bad the rest of the staff tends to be (with a few exceptions - they know who they are, I hope!). I'm done here.  Never, ever coming back to this location ever again, maybe not Applebee's anywhere again.  At least Chili's is dependable with their food service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

35,Casey C.,"Woburn, MA",0,38,5.0,1.0,2015-06-04,"I get it, it Applebee's. I wasn't expecting much and they manage to deliver even less than that. I went mid week, mid day, I'm thinking / hoping it must have been shift change over. We got there and we were seated very quickly (the place was close to empty) by the nice hostess and we told our waitress would be right over, about 10 minutes later she did arrive and took our drink orders, I tried giving her our meal orders but she walked away too fast. A few minutes later she returned with our drinks/ took our orders and that was the last I saw of her. I'm not sure where she went but it would have nice/professional for her to say ""I'm leaving for the day and (name) will be taking over from here on."" Someone else delivered our food. No one checked on us. I needed more dressing since the chicken tenders on my oriental salad were so over cooked and tough, i was hoping a little dressing would soften them up and one of the people I was with ordered her meal with a side of rice, which was cold. Not sitting around and cooled off cold, like took right from them fridge and put in a plate. Gross and inedible. So we finished our food (the parts that were semi hot/edible) and sat, and sat and sat some more. Then a young man came over and cleared our dishes. Then ANOTHER young man asked if we wanted dessert, my friend did want to look so we said sure. And he walked away and returned 10 minutes later with the check. Not the dessert menu. The check. So my friend again asked him for the dessert menu and he brought it over. We picked a fried Apple cheesecake thing. Not too bad, but after a crummy meal they had no place to go but up. Again, I get it , it's Applebee's. I wanted something quick (that didn't happen) and semi-tasteful (Hahaha...not even close) but i guess that was asking too much.

Also, the chicken quesadillas have been hearty with tons of meat. Service here has been terrific in my experience. The waiters make light conversation while tending to your needs.

28,Mark D.,"Salem, MA",0,1,,1.0,2015-09-03,"Let me preempt this review with one side note. I CREATED a yelp account just so I could warn people about this establishment If I could give less than 1 star I would. My experience here was nothing short of abysmal.  I went in for lunch with 4 of my co-workers today at 12:00pm. We get seated and our waitress comes up to us and takes our drink orders. No problems with the drink orders, they arrive shortly. We then put in 5 simple meals: 4 hamburgers (MEDIUM) and 1 shrimp scampi. Once we put in our order we wait for no less than 35-40 minutes for our food with not ONE mention or apology from our server. She did not come by once in the 40 minute wait to inform us about where our food comes. Finally, our food arrives at almost 1:00pm only to find out that all four of our MEDIUM burgers were charred to a crisp, almost inedible. We immediately ask for the check, wanting to end this experience as soon as possible. The server comes back and rudely mentions that she ""so kindly"" deducted 10 dollars from the bill because of the ""slightly over cooked hamburgers."" At this point, we were all late from our lunch break and in more of a hurry than before. We quickly give her our cards and she proceeds to mix up our charges not once, but TWO times, taking close to 20 minutes. Finally after about an hour and a half of nothing but inconvenience, we pay our bills and leave. We were not apologized to once throughout our entire meal, or even asked if everything was OK.

The burger my brother got was overcooked, he was specifically asked if he wanted it pink in the middle or not and there was no pink in sight. Our friend's steak was ordered rare but was warmed through instead of simply being charred and served. Fried chicken tenders were overcooked to being hard even for a fork to pierce and overall the portion sizes were underwhelming. I wish I could say the food was the worst problem we faced. Service was incredibly slow. Even recognizing that it was a Friday night the restaurant was not that busy and there were service people everywhere. Our first round of drinks arrived after our appetizers, and we weren't offered a second until halfway through our entrees which showed up after our entrees were finished. A dessert was brought to our table that we didn't order and while eating dessert my brother requested a mountain dew which took forever to show up. Finally our check was delivered and we waited at least ten minutes before it was picked up. One could blame the delay on the alcoholic beverages on the bar but everything else service-wise can only be blamed on the wait staff. I have been to this Applebees many times over the years and this is by far the most disappointing experience I've ever had. The standards have certainly dropped over the years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
15,Butch L.,"Woburn, MA",0,3,,3.0,2016-02-19,"Late one night, I decided I would stop by my local neighborhood Applebees for a bite to eat. Some of their appetizers are half price after a certain hour, so I decided on the boneless wings and the quesadilla appetizer.  The quesadilla was not bad, but nothing to write home about. The wings on the other hand were just flat out bad. They were also really small, but that might have been a blessing in disguise. What was I expecting from going to Applebees at 11pm and ordering wings and a quesadilla though? All that said, they do have the best kiwi lemonade I've had since Nam. I'm not much of one for giving out ratings, but if I was hand-delivered a subpoena and called to the stand as a witness in a court case involving my experience at this Applebees, I would give them a 6.3/10 rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003

I waited for 5 minutes to even get seated, 5 minutes for the server to acknowledge our table, and 30 minutes for food to come out. I realize this is not a 5 star restaurant, but I had higher expectations. Drove by the other night and the sewer was backed up in the parking lot, just another day at Applebee's! The only reason I want to go back is out of convenience and the fact that I can walk there from home. I hope this place goes out of business and they put a nicer restaurant there...

10,Brooke P.,"Woburn, MA",82,10,,4.0,2016-10-31,"There's one reason I'm singling out this location of Applebee's among all its other locations: the bartender, Kenny. His spot-on recommendations and sense of humor were the reason we stayed for a second drink after intending only to pop in for lunch. The food was typical Applebee's fare; it was hot and reasonably tasty for a fast-casual lunch. Our server was extremely friendly and checked on us often. This may be the first Applebee's I ever return to as a regular simply to partake in Kenny's repartee and extensive drink knowledge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

2,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566.0,5.0,2017-04-15,"Always a great experience from Applebee's, but the Woburn location was exceptionally fantastic!  Between TC (in training), Sara, and Dan (the manager), everyone who works here is always in a great mood and the most interested in pleasing all of their customers by providing a clean space, a healthy menu (well, not like some other chains), great bargains (the 2 for $20 menu is great!), and great service!  Onion rings, burgers, steaks and more, everything is delicious, decently sized, and perfect for a full meal. Miles better than some other chains of this type and the service is so fast. Sara, our waitress, was just so happy, funny, and kind. She completely brightened up my visit to this restaurant.  The restaurant is large in size and composed of a bar, tables, and booths. The ambiance is perfect for families as well as couples or even a group meeting. Casual dressing and never too long of a wait.  Comfortable place, and something on the menu for everyone.  Separate parking lot is a nice gesture, and ever a few to go spots.  Wonderful place to get a decent dinner meal in the Woburn area. 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
3,Brenda W.,"Woburn, MA",0,11,,1.0,2017-04-20,"Ordered takeout. It's never been this bad before. Got a 6oz sirloin, skewer of shrimp, baked potato. When I opened the potato, after noting they have gone back to salting the outsides (bad idea, too much salt, & the skin is where all the nutrition is) I found black parts through it. Managed to salvage about half. No need to buy such low quality potatoes, too many that are high quality at good prices to be chinchy.  The state was ordered medium, it was very rare. Char on the outside, in the center it was blood red & very cool. Again, shouldn't happen in a place with a good reputation. The shrimp was so undercooked I didn't trust them (my favorite part too), they were barely translucent. My husband will nuke them to death for lunch tomorrow. This Applebee's has gone down hill very rapidly. Have no idea why. But, they better change their ways or they won't be around much longer. I could have saved my dinner & presented it to the board of health, as unhealthy cooking. But, this time I didn't.  Even my frozen steak teriyaki rice bowls at lunch are better, they only cost $2.50. Their broccoli is beautiful, tender crisp, bright green, these were limp looking & faded.  Applebee's you used to be so good.

4,Perry S.,"Woburn, MA",131,25,,5.0,2017-05-17,"I received a gift card to Applebee's for my birthday.  Usually I stear away from chain restaurants (having worked in one myself) but my boyfriend and I figured we should use the gift card and take a night off from cooking.  From the moment we walked in, Sam was outstanding.  She greeted us with a smile, told us about the special deals of the night, had an extremely positive attitude, and gave us the best service I've recevied in quite some time. Being in the business myself, I am a huge critic when it comes to service.  Dining at higher-end restaurants and receiving mediocre service at best, has become sort of a norm for my boyfriend and I.  But Sam is one of the best servers I've ever had.  As for the food, it's an Applebee's, you get what you pay for, but both of our meals were pretty tasty!  We will definitely be back to see Sam!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
5,Adam S.,"Framingham, MA",27,1,,4.0,2017-06-04,"Every time I have been there Kenny has been amazing on the bar. As well Jen D who was serving and Becky who was on the bar. Kenny is always spot on when working and makes everyone laugh. He goes above and beyond. He even helped as a host and sat people, even brought out delayed orders for tables! Also great suggestions from the menu to everyone at the bar. Becky makes a great drink when on the bar and makes sure your food is out in good time. Jen D was training on bar and did a great job too one of the times I was there. Granted this was over multiple visits.  No bad words for this place. Slightly biased, but kenny is amazing and needs a raise! He could be a manager.
