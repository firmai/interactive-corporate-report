Jinbo W.,"Centreville, VA",6,1,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Service is so slow. We waited 10 minutes to get order. The waiter even forgot our utensils. We asked them, he got our utensils and forgot our kids'. We had been waited and waited. The kids were hungry and they didn't have spoon to eat. Food is so so. Overall: worst service I had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20

Jen S.,"Diamondhead, MS",0,3,,1.0,7/29/2016,"The reviews were bad, but I wanted to believe Chili's was Chili's how bad could it be?!  It was BAD. We travel a lot, and in every chili's the bar is 1st come/1st serve. Not here. If you want to sit in the bar you wait with regular seating.  2nd- the service was terrible! 3rd- They do not do 2 for 1 Happy Hour!!!  The sign on table doesn't specify what drafts are what price. No way to know.  4th-chips & salsa are Not free in the bar - as with FL, LA, MS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20

Andrew G.,"Nutley, NJ",0,5,2,1.0,7/24/2015,"I've came to this restaurant while on vacation,...which was a mistake. The moment you walk in,the floors are not swept,the place looks kind of dull. Waiting time was exceptional, atleast it was'nt like last time where it was an hour long wait. As for my food,it fell below my expectations. The burger was good,but was not a fan of the spiced pickles. (They could've said something about that) I ordered the crispy chicken fingers,first the guy gave me a small 3piece side. I then asked that I wanted the chick,en meal. Then he gave me an plate of fries w/ a smaller 2 piece that was almost inedible. Which usually for 10 dollars, you'll get like 7 big pieces for that price. The salad was ok, but what they had as for Italian dressing was horrible. I ordered a side of broccoli which they forgot about. The waiter was overly happy (into himself) even annoyingly flattered himself. He even mentioned that alot of the food is precooked to be cooked again for later on...Hey,some places may do that but won't mention it,so thanks for mentioning it,but did'nt need to hear it. That's problaby why my chicken was the way it was. .......  When it came down to paying for the food, it took a lot longer and more complicated than it should have been.  The waiter used like 4 or 5 different machines,because they were'nt working. ..... But I give a small thumbs up for the effort. ""My pleasure they say"" Good thing the place was so empty, or the service would've been more of an unfortunate experience. 3 years since the last visit and still a dissapointment,smh. (needs better upkeep, with a better presentable service) For anyone that comes here, hope you don't get a ""little,tiny-big supprise"" on a rainy day, the workers their didn't seem to be to surprised when it came out of nowhere, like this is something that happens often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20
Jeff B.,"Lowell, MA",12,30,6,2.0,4/19/2016,"Honestly all chili's suck.... And so does this one.  The waitress forgot numerous things, I ordered a bean burger they gave me a regular one.  Yuck",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20

Randi F.,"Garden Grove, CA",85,191,100,3.0,11/28/2014,"Our waiter was a total dick. Told us he was ""hungover"" ...ummm like we care ? Food was good though... Guy looked like a stoner..

Joe Z.,"Gaffney, SC",0,3,,1.0,7/8/2015,"I have been going to Chili's over the years and have always liked them.  It can be a good late stop after a road trip with the kids or a happy hour spot. Recently, after a day at Bush Gardens with the family, I went to the Chili's in Williamsburg VA and ordered the fish taco's...  The fish in them was rancid, as in rotten.  My girlfriend took a bite of a different taco and confirmed the meat was no good. I returned them and ordered some sliders, I wasn't trying to scam for free food and just wanted a meal.  The chef came out and denied the fish was bad, then he said it was my taste buds and that I didn't like his spice... then he stormed off... All in front of my kids and girlfriend. After that the service was super slow, to non existent... I suspect that the chef had bullied the staff into dismissing us... Before that the manager and waiter had been present and pleasant.  Basically: They served me rotten fish and when I complained the chef blamed me and had his staff treat us like dirt. Nasty experience for sure... Nastier fish tacos... Yuck",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20
DJ H.,"Hampton Roads Center, VA",35,55,33,3.0,10/10/2014,I enjoyed my time at chillis it was good. I enjoyed my ribs the only flaw I noticed was it took to long.

Jodie C.,"Warrenton, VA",29,436,1320,3.0,8/2/2015,This is an ok chili's. Got the tableside guac and  chips. It was alright.

Kat W.,"Williamsburg, VA",56,11,6,1.0,12/28/2015,It has the worst service. Got sat right away but waited 25 mins just to put an order of water in. I don't recommend this place unless you want to wait forever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20
Kristopher S.,"Williamsburg, VA",133,25,5,1.0,6/24/2016,Awful service. Gave old guacamole twice. We then had to ask for tableside so we knew it wasn't old and oxidized.

Kelsey H.,"Williamsburg, VA",22,35,1,4.0,10/29/2014,"I went with a group on a Friday night. They weren't terribly busy, and our waitress was awesome. She was a lot of fun to work with and offered great suggestions. My only complaint is the water. Have you ever had clear water that literally tasted like dirt? If that's your thing, then Chili's is your place. Otherwise I would suck it up and pay for a soda. When I told our waitress about the dirt water, she said that it's a problem that all the restaurants have, but I'm a regular at the Applebee's next door and they don't have dirt water, so maybe that's something management should look into.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20
Rich O.,"Newport News, VA",46,42,,2.0,6/30/2014,"This visit to Chili's started off like any other, we entered and were seated promptly.  From ordering drinks and receiving them to ordering lunch went well.  Then came the wait...  We saw our waitress almost in tears taking food back to the kitchen a few booths from us.  After over an hour of waiting, our food finally arrived.  The food itself was standard Chili's fare, and was fine.  My guess is that the kitchen was having more of their normal issues (we waited a while here for a food a few weeks ago, but nothing like this!), and without us prompting, the Manager came out and apologized and gave us 1/2 off of our meals.  When she brought the bill out, our waitress asked if the Manager had been out to see us, so I'm guessing that she was the one that sent her.  It's very unlikely that we'll now give this Chili's another shot - we'll stick with the one in Newport News.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20
Dee M.,"Richmond, VA",3,1,,1.0,8/17/2014,First and foremost Chili's is one of my favorite restaurants. This ONE just has bad customer service!

Jim V.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,32,,4.0,1/6/2018,"Ok. So here I was...snowing and everything seemed to be closed. Not Chili's. And let me tell you, the GM scored big time on Thursday evening. Could he have chosen not to open?  He could have but instead chose to give it a shot with limited staff. And that staff hit it out of the park.  Honestly better service than they normally display with a full staff!  Dining room was full, as was the bar; they never skipped a beat. The GM was running food, servers were a team and it all ended with a very well done meal.  The deconstructed avocado burger didn't have to happen but they made it happen. Big fan of theirs now. Just pray they keep it up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg
Libby V.,"Cincinnati, OH",137,266,1231,4.0,11/2/2017,It's a chain but this location was great. They worked with me to make a wonderful peach martini when I spotted the vodka I wanted. And it was happy hour so there was that. We shared some apps that were fine. But that Salted Carmel Cake was to die for. Two of us couldn't finish it cause it was huge. I'd go back again and again for that cake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg
Kathleen G.,"Hampton, VA",94,51,107,2.0,8/1/2016,"I'm only giving two stars because I love Chilis.* But the worst service I have had in a lonnnnnng time. It took us about 15 minutes to get seated, and it was dead. Maybe two or three tables seated when we got there. Another 10 minutes or so until we were asked for drinks. And another 25 minutes until she came back and took our order. We ordered an appetizer and she came out a few minutes later and said that it would take a while and if we wanted to order another one. Thinking that this new appetizer would replace the original one we ordered.  Wrong.  The original one came out before the second we ordered. And when we asked for it to be taken off our bill because of the waitress lack of communication, she stormed off and never came back. Empty drinks and broken promises. We paid our bill with the ziosk thing and had to get our own To-go boxes.  Also, employees were literally just sitting around on their cell phones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg
MiMi G.,"Hampton, VA",0,7,,3.0,11/12/2017,"Great service immediately when we walked in. Hostess was bubbly and nice, sat us quickly. Maddy our server was adorable interacting with the table. Food was great, great portions had to take half home, we were there for both my daughter's birthday as well as Veterans day as my husband is a Vet. We came here after a leaving another establishment that night that had horrible service, so coming to Chili's was a breath of fresh air! The only reason I didn't give 4 stars was because they were supposed to sing to my daughter for her birthday as a surprise, but never did.

Andrew S.,"Richmond, VA",2,8,,1.0,10/15/2017,"Really should be a 1/2 star at best.  Ordered Fajita combo with chicken, steak, shrimp.  Specified no cilantro.  Steak was like shoe leather.  Black beans side was cold.  They forgot the chicken entirely.  Half way through the meal the server stops by and I tell him about the missing food.  I'm almost finished and he brings it, smothered in cilantro, takes it back.  When I am finished, he tells me a new portion will be ""right out"".  I tell him to forget it.  Later, after I've paid, the manager brings it in a doggie bag. Problem was that I was driving back home that night (to Richmond).  Told him to keep it.  They ""graciously"" took $3 off the bill - should have comped the whole thing in my view.  Not the first time they've screwed up my meal.

When food came out my daughter's order wasn't right, but he decided to keep it and said it was good. Husband 's steak was over cooked, but mine was perfect.   2 stars due to service.

Mary A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,3,,3.0,7/18/2017,I love chili's and you can't beat the bottomless chips and dip. I visited this location twice in one week and both visits didn't meet my expectations.  I was on a business trip and dining alone.  The wait staff took extra long to get me refills and reload the drinks and chips. It took forever to get my check too. The second time I was on the bar section and I had to wait 40 minutes for her to give me a check. I had to go up and ask for my check.  She was chatting up with a young guy at the bar.... I will not be visiting this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg
David L.,"Williamsburg, VA",2,113,321,2.0,4/24/2016,"What was once a great place to dine at has become in my opinion, the worst of the chain restaurants. The quality of ingredients and veggies are just not fresh. The service was good but no excuse for poorly made food.

All our glasses were empty when our food came and she did not offer to refill them. Having been there more than an hour already, we just asked for to-go boxes when the food arrived since the kids were starting to melt down.

It was so slow, my wife ordered unlimited soup and salad and just got one of each. Soup had to go back three times because it was lukewarm.  2. Love that their table top touchscreen of games as trivia does not inform you of the $1.99 charge for using it.  3. I ordered the ribs and shrimp combo. The shrimp were so small and frozen, I can buy better shrimp from Costco. Then they coated it in pepper seasoning to make up for the lack of flavor, and you could no longer taste the shrimp.  4.
