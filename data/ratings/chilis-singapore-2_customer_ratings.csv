0,Claudia P.,"Singapore, Singapore",8,226,224,4.0,2012-08-11,"Casual American dining with a popular Tanglin branch, but I've only ever been to this JCube outlet.  Booth-style restaurant with decent food and really huge portions - don't bother with Starters if you have a small appetite - the mains alone will leave you stuffed. I ordered the Country Fried Chicken and while the chicken was on the oily side, the mashed potato with cheese sauce on top was divine. As was the fried corn on cob and garlic bread. Hearty stuff! My friend ordered the honey chipotle chicken and that was excellent as well.  I love their huge portions of blackberry iced tea.  In total we spent around $62 for 1 starter, 2 mains and 2 blackberry iced teas and left stuffed to the brim. I wanted to try their Oreo sundae but I really couldn't stuff anymore in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-2,,,,,
1,Eric C.,"Singapore, Singapore",19,270,274,3.0,2012-08-12,"Having studied in the States for a while, I am somewhat familiar with the Chill's over there. Can't say that I am a huge fan of the food, but I thought it was decent American grub. So this is a newly opened restaurant in JCube, and the overall presentation feels like the American version. Let's talk about the food. I ordered the Wings Over Baffalo, and I found that the wings are a little spicy and sour. Not too bad at all. We had the blue cheese dressing which went well with the wings. Next, we also had the bacon chicken ranch quesadilla, but I was somewhat disappointed by it because it was very dry. There was also a distinct lack of cheese, which meant that this dish didn't really stay true to its name. We also had a few other dishes but found that they didn't really hold up the quality of the food found in the branches in the States.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-2,,,,,
