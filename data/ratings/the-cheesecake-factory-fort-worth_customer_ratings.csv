Amazing selections, great food, everyone was attentive and I can't wait to come back. To start, we ordered the fried Mac &  cheese and this was not only a hit at our table, but at our neighbors as well (we shared). These delicious fried balls are so good you'll want the recipe.  BF got Revolver, I had a Moscato and it was very good. Our friend had the blueberry Mojito which she LOVED.  I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and I have to say it was great. And HUGE. Had to take the other half home. My BF loved his steak so much and said he hasn't had anything this good in a long time.  Out cheesecake was, as expected, amazing. I usually don't go for cheesecake but it was great and also ginormous!  Overall, service was great and so was the food.

66,Stan M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,6.0,4.0,2014-12-15,"Called ahead, but they do not take over the phone reservations. So we went there at 4:15 and had a party of 7. The girl gave us a receipt that said to return at 7. Since it's new to the area I wasn't upset. Walked over to Sundance Square and took pictures with our group around the Christmas decorations. About 40 minutes after placing our reservation we were notified our table was ready so I was very pleased. Got seated in a big circular booth that made it feel private, which we liked. the waitres Pmins was good, except when she dropped a drink on the table and in the end she also messed up our receipt 3 times, but not a big deal. Although the restaurant appeared at maximum capacity, the food came out at a good pace. Everything was delicious. Only complaint was the martinis were pricey for their size. $10 each is a bit much I think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=80,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352

Now I understand it's new but to not even apologize or to not inform us of the status of our wait is unheard of. But I will say that the our waiters Patrick and Hilary were wonderful.  Now let's get to the food. My friend sent his pasta back because the chicken wasn't cooked properly and when he got his second plate the food was not impressionable . I mean I've made better spaghetti . Not to mention he got food poisoning and I have a rash all over my body . I am not allergic to much actually nothing at all.

The good thing was the hostess took my name and we were able to leave and walk around downtown, they would text us when the table was ready. Came back about an hour later, we were seated and our waitress Heather was really good! She seriously made our night. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, which were amazing!! And my entree was the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. At first the taste was overwhelming and the plate was huge, but I ended up loving it. My boyfriend loved his fried catfish plate. His only complaint was that the portion size wasn't enough. My brother also had what I had and he just LOVED it. My mom also really loved her Shrimp plate.  The place is beautiful.

We were seated at our table and waited 15 minutes to have our drink order taken.

Lastly, our drinks were never refilled and she never came to check on us. Our appetizer order had to be brought out by another waitress. The whole service was awful and a waste of money.

I think they were busy do he could not make any effort to fix it, i seriously thought they forgot to add any seasoning to  the batter at all hence the bland taste.

126,Stephen F.,"Fort Worth, TX",18,8,,1.0,2015-03-08,"March 6 was my birthday and i had called 2 weeks prior to the date calling to reserve a table. The woman on the phone said they ""Do Not"" take reservations unless you have a party of 20 and over. I had a party of 22 and when i arrived on March 6, the hostess' said we do not ""Ever"" take reservations. So having to be upset already, i just asked for a table for 22 and the manager came up and said it was a first come first serve basis depending on how much of your party was there. The manager had told me there were 2 parties ahead of me with a total of 20 people each so the wait would be 3 hours. But i told the manager that i was only missing 4 people of my party while the other 2 large parties only had 4 people in general. So at this point i was already angry due to the fact i was not able to have a table, have been lied to about reservations, and first come first serve with how many of your guests are there did not take effect. So the manager suggested to split my party into 6 tables around the whole restaurant not near each other and have me walk around the whole night. I had taken the idea and seated my guests. As the night went on i went table to table visiting my guests, my friends had told the waiters that it was my birthday but no birthday cheesecake or singing happened. All the other 5 birthday celebrants at other tables in the restaurant got that but i did not. Within one hour of our seating i glanced at the table of 20 that the manager said would be full, the table was empty because the one person ahead of me, party was not there yet. Once all my tables were done, leaving the restaurant i talked to the manager and he just apologized and the hostess' at the front just glared at me. My experience that night was an absolute disaster, having them to suggest i go somewhere else downtown was even worse. I picked Cheesecake Factory for the reason that i go there at least once every 2-3 weeks with great food. Horrible Customer Service. If i was able to rate this with no stars i would. The hostess' at the front are just absolutely rude and faces with ignorance.Ruined my birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=140,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

Appetizer didn't take too long, sever said bread would be out shortly and it wasn't short, maybe like 20 min after our appetizer came out. Our entrees took even longer.

I've been to other locations, but this has been by far the best experience. We had an absolutely FANTASTIC waitress (Halee) who made our dining experience fantastic. We had no wait to be seated on a Sunday night. Our drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert all came out in a timely fashion. We were never left wondering, ""Uh, where is our food?""  It's true, the price is slightly ""expensive"" but do you people realize how much freaking food you are actually getting? I may have paid close to $17 for the spicky chicken cashew dish, but that will give me leftovers to TWO additional meals. We had the calamari appetizer and that was HUGE, too! I think that you get what you pay for here. Even though our meal was over $80 pre-tip, I would still go back... and I wouldn't complain about paying for a cent of it!  Our cocktails were amazing. I would suggest the passionfruit margarita! The spicy pineapple margariata was actually spicy, which is hard to find even if it is marketed as spicy. And of course, our cheesecake was to die for. The Adam's peanut butter was sooo good.  I really hope people can start to look pass the price and realize that they're getting good food, large portions and outstanding service in a fun environment.

The best part of my meal was my two cosmopolitans: beware! They are overpriced and you do not know until you're ready to pay. Each drink was $11 each. Sodas and teas are $3 each, but the waiters and waitresses do not show up frequently enough to make it fair to say you get more to drink for $3, because you might get one refill if you're lucky!

It was dead inside the restaurant (I've never seen a CF this dead) and we weren't greeted pleasantly after explaining we wanted our order to go.  We were told to go order at the cheesecake counter, so we did, but not after waiting for a few minutes while the employees sat around and chatted with each other about their personal lives.  Ok, that's neat.  Even while taking our order, we didn't receive the friendly service I typically associate with CF, even if it's faked. I ordered the Chicken Madiera and my wife ordered Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  After getting back to the hotel and opening our containers, I was happy to see the orders were correct but not happy about the portion size which is obviously diminished compared to what you'd get on plate if you dined in.  The food just wasn't good, cooked and presented sloppily.  I've never had a meal at CF that I didn't enjoy, but I guess there's a first time for everything.  I would eat at CF again, but not this location.  Unfriendly service + unfriendly food (to my taste buds) + overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=80,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.6960000000000006,2.36

Finally had to say something just to order appetizers.  Had to tell him we were ready to order our entrees too. So we get two appetizers and he brought out an appetizer salad with the entree. That is so stupid when you don't know  how to pace the food of your patrons. I've waited tables, so I know. And the most dissapointing experience about it was that the food came out just warm, if not cold. I had the hibatchi steak. Was very good, but only warm. the mashed potatoes were cold. They brought me more which were okay. They also were on the dry side. Very dissapointing.  When i waited tables, we learned that the food has to go out ""piping hot."" Did that change sonewhere? The cheesecakes were very good, but that is expected. Anyway, I will never go back to this location. Thats okay too because they are over priced and over rated. I've had a better experience at the arlington and Southlake locations. I advise steering clear from this place if you are in downtown fort worth.

Service can be slow when the place is packed as it seems each server has 6-7 tables which can be overwhelming when there are 4-6 people at each table.  They do share duties of running food from the kitchen, so that helps.  On my last visit, we had a server-in-training, and honestly, it was fantastic.  She was very skilled and knowledgable about everything on the menu.  This time they had my soy-glazed salmon, one of my favorites,  The time before, they were out of salmon, kinda unforgivable for a place that has 3 main items for their salmon.  In any event event, this time it was superb, nice crust on outside, not too done on inside.  I had the brown rice with it which again was very well cooked.  Its a lot of food, and the staff never hesitates to bring you a box to go, which you'll need if you want to leave room for a slice of cheesecake (you should).  My daughter had the Miso salmon, which was also perfectly cooked.  She tells me the orange chicken here is as good as any place she's had it.   The cheesecake menu is extensive and they always have a seasonal flavor or two added to the menu.  Get it to share, as it's oh so rich.  Even with two people you are likely to have some to take home. Oh, and they have Diet Dr. Pepper here.  One of few large chains that consistently carries it. Overall, I love Cheesecake Factory ... extensive menu, good/great service when I've been there, excellent parking situation.  It's not the kind of place you go for an intimate conversation with your significant other (it can be noisy), but a great place with the family where everyone can find something they like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=100,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.7359999999999998,2.6

She had ordered the sweet potato fries and they brought out the original fries (bummer #2). She enjoyed the sandwich but skipped the fries. Our little one decided on the mac 'n cheese and really liked it. The kids menu is pretty decent, about 8 entree options to choose from with a drink and side. I ordered the BBQ burger and it was freaking awesome. I finished every last bite.  When the time came to order cheesecake, we poured over the longer-than-ever menu and finally landed on the turtle caramel. We were so full from the lunch we had barely enough room to share one piece of cake (bummer #3). It was really tasty, although I wish they didn't add this giant mound of nearly-frozen chocolate cake frosting to the top. It really made the cheesecake more difficult to eat (the bottom part was softer and it was hard to get a bite of everything).  As usual there was a bit of sticker shock with the final bill- but hey, that's Cheesecake Factory. Expect to spend $60 on a lunch with no alcohol for 2 adults and a little one.

My favorites from it include the little house salad, Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos, grilled artichoke, basil tomato and mozzarella flatbread, chopped salad, Mexican tortilla salad, and the white chicken chili which is what I ordered last night. It has chicken, white beans, roasted green chilies, onions, garlic, a touch of cream, fresh salsa, and your choice of either white or brown rice for $13.95. It's both filling and full of flavor without the guilt since it's under 590 calories.  The guilt comes alongside the cheesecake and is worth every bite! The one I love most is the Dulce De Leche with its swirls of caramel, real whipped cream, and candied almond crumbles. Have Mercy. Honorable mentions include the Original, Vanilla Bean, Fresh Strawberry, Fresh Banana Cream, and two new ones (to me) I had the pleasure of trying last night. The Tiramisu (I die) and the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee. I'm not a big chocolate person but that one just might convert me. It is divine! The Kahlua flavor is subtle enough that you dangerously keep wanting to go back in for another bite.  I will be a return customer for sure. Might as well book me a regular table in the fall when the return of the pumpkin pecan cheesecake arrives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.2239999999999998,3.0800000000000005

We ordered immediately and waited over 45 minutes for our food.  When we finally got our food we asked for to go boxes because we were already late for our plans and just decided to eat it later.  We got home and both of our food was overdone. My husband's burger was black and my chicken was dry. As we were leaving I decided to get a slice of cheesecake to go. Somehow the ticket got lost for my order and it took almost 15 minutes for them to even acknowledge it. Will not be back at this location. Over $50 for 2 people to eat overcooked food.

134,Elizabeth G.,"Brentwood, TN",0,4,,1.0,2016-04-01,"I was there last night for a birthday dinner and was so disappointed in the management (waitress was actually great!). It was a big party (about 15 of us total), which I realize is a lot, especially finding out they don't take reservations. Just to be safe though, I called about 4 hours ahead of time to give them a heads up that I would have a big party coming in. When calling, they flat out told me ""we don't take reservations"". I was also put through to the manager to talk to him. He was so incredibly rude and almost sounded as if he would rather not have such a large party coming in. Excuse me sir, it will be a large group of people, most likely spending at least over $200 and you don't want our business? Classy. I think the cherry on top of it all was the rude hostesses. We came in at 7:00, like I said when I called earlier, and when telling them I had 15 people in my party they just looked at me shocked and said ""wow, that's a lot of people."" Well, I called about 4 hours ago, but apparently you all didn't care. They told me to wait to the side and the manager would come out to talk to me. Manager came out and turned his back to me while talking to the hostesses and proceeded to walk away. Said absolutely nothing to me. They told me the wait would be about an hour to an hour and a half. I understand the long wait was not the hostesses fault AT ALL, but they could have at least been nice. They stood there while waited (over an hour wait), just staring at us and obviously gossiping with other employees. So rude. Overall, such an awful experience, aside from the incredible food and great waitress, but can not get over how awful the management was. They need to have an actual plan for when larger groups come in. Other than their signature phrase ""we don't take reservations"". Will not be going back anytime soon. Should have picked a different place that was much more accommodating to a large group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=140,3.08,3.08,3.08,1.988,3.0800000000000005
133,Jason S.,"Fort Worth, TX",217,29,21.0,1.0,2016-04-10,"First I want to start off by stating I love the Cheesecake Factory. However if you're in the mood for the Cheesecake Factory I would highly suggest a different location like the Arlington location. We came here for my sisters birthday and the experience had its high and lows. The greeter that assigned seating was friendly and energetic. That was a positive. However the Hostess that seated us appeared upset and didn't want to be there, she never turned to look at us or even say a word to us. Showed us to our table didn't say anything and walked away with a grim look on her face. We had a table of 9 and had a waitress and waiter. The female was a bit older and at times seemed distraught and upset, while the younger waiter seemed unfocused and bored. When he asked if we were ready to order a drink our entire party had not even say down yet. And when I told him we were ready he seemed annoyed. He came back two minutes later and asked again when I asked him what was the ""special"" lemonade. He said it was a kind of strawberry raspberry lemonade. I said yeah sure I'll get that, when he angrily looked at me and said loudly strawberry or raspberry!? I said oh I thought you said it was a strawberry raspberry lemonade as in both were in the flavor. He just blankly starred at me and I told him strawberry. The most upsetting part of the whole experience was trying to flag down a waiter, host, or waitress to tell them it was my sisters birthday in secret so she would be surprised. First I tried the first hostess that never said anything to us that seated us, and she looked at me and rolled her eyes. The next waitress that brought me my food was next. I told her wait one second I have something to ask you, then the another waitress asked who's four cheese pasta was this? To which I said it was mine, and by the time I turned back to the waitress next to me she was gone. The birthday song they sang a couple of them started off que which made it awkward then only about three of the seven or so waiters/waitress sang while two were laughing at each other. The food was delicious as usual, the drinks I had were also delicious. The bartenders were the same ones that's I remember from when I came on Valentine's Day and they were awesome as well.

The portions (even lunch) are big but not too big to say no to the cheesecake for the dessert. I will definitely be back!  My only complaint is about the ambience.

It was also presented in an attractive manner with four wonton chips, no surprise there.  The size of the Tower was really small also, I don't see how this would've a shared appetizer either.  There was very little tuna in there and it appeared very wilted, it wasn't firm and fresh.  The top of the tower had a huge pile of sushi ginger.  Big mistake, this defeats the point of the dish as the purpose of sushi ginger is to cleanse the palate after sushi.  It's like eating a steak with toothpaste.  Anywho--- I ate it. What I was hot and hungry.  Husband had soup and toast we did not share but for some reason we were really sick to our stomach when we left this place, therefore we will never eat at another Cheesecake Factory unless it's something we have to attend such as a family event we get invited to- crossing my fingers that nebver happens.   As far as service goes, our waitress was friendly but only checked on us when the order arrived and did not come back until it was time to pay up.  We did hear another staff member was complaining about the amount of babies in there and I'm sure the manager heard her, he was right next to her.  BTW manager man, it wouldn't hurt to pretend to like your job, you looked pissed off the entire time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=80,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.2800000000000002,3.0000000000000004

My friend ordered the Skinny Tomato Basil Pasta dish.  Our food came out and about 10 minutes later the manager approached our table to apologize that she had gotten the wrong dish and she was in fact not eating the skinny version, but the regular.  The manager and waiter were super apologetic, but I really felt like if their menu was smaller something like this wouldn't have happened.  My friend just blew it off and continued to eat her high calorie meal.   The cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is usually the best thing about the visit.  This visit I went all out and got the turtle and it was great.  I have had the Vanilla Bean in the past and it is also good.

We asked for the last meal? and the waiter went to the kitchen and came back to say it was coming soon.  He had double-checked our orders so I'm pretty sure it was a kitchen issue. My sister's egg benedict was literally not just lukewarm, but actually cold. So now we needed 2 eggs benedicts. They were not expedited out, so we were all through eating when the other 2 meals arrived. And they were dropped off without anyone asking if everything was ok. Both were cold. My sister had everyone touch hers so we wouldn't think she was being dramatic.  Cold. The replacement eggs benedict were colder than the original cold eggs benedict. Soup wasn't hot, crab hash wasn't hot (lukewarm and the poached egg was basically boiled), french toast barely warm.  We all waited tables in school. Major kitchen issues at that restaurant. My husband and I drove 4 hrs each way to meet my mom and sisters there for a special meal. Sigh. Meanwhile the Mothers Day line is growing at the door. We arrived at 10:00am, ordered at 10:25am, and everyone still had not eaten by 11:30am. I truly felt sorry for all those people, knowing what they were in for... The mgrs did come to the table of course. We didn't pay for the 2 meals that were never delivered. We are not considering cold eggs dishes as ""delivered."" They gave everyone a free dessert. Lots of apologies.  Why on Earth did they offer a full menu when they clearly couldn't deliver it? Bad management decision. And they were under-staffed. And the kitchen issues are obvious.

Wrong. After waiting 40 minutes I went inside and asked the hostess how much longer. She told me that she had no idea. This made me upset because if they didn't know then how in the heck did they know when I got there it would be 40 minutes? We continued waiting, for an hour and a half which at that point we decided to sit in the lounge area which right when we sat down I got the text that our table was ready, oh well. All of our food came out at a decent time. The spinach dip appetizer was great but the margherita pizza was below average. All our meals were good except one of us ordered a salad and it didn't have any ingredients except lettuce and tomatoes. It was missing chicken, tortilla strips, and many other toppings. The manager came over and apologized. They took off the salad and gave us a free cheesecake. The meal was good but by the time we left had been there wait time included for 3+ hours.

Then after we were sat, it took 10 minutes for anyone to come and get a drink order. I got a beer, and my husband got a coffee. When the waiter (Cedric) returned with the drinks, he told me he thought my beer was disgusting. Maybe he was trying to make small talk? Idk. But that was rude in my opinion. Then I ordered salmon for lunch, I asked for it to be cooked rare. He (Cedric) said, ""ok I'll tell them you want it not too well-done"". I said, ""no, please tell them rare, not medium rare or anything else, rare."" He he said ""ok, I understand. Like tuna tartare."" And then I said ""yes, exactly"". Then, our meals came out before our appetizer. The one highlight of the experience I that the manager, that delivered the appetizer said ""oh, I'm sorry this didn't come out first. I'll take that off your bill."" Anyways, I cut into my salmon, and it's dry and burnt and overcooked. The mashed potatoes it came with were cold. And so was the broccoli. I didn't touch the meal at all. When the waiter saw this, he said, ""how's the salmon cooked?"" I said ""way too overdone for me."" Then he said ""sorry. I told them to make it medium rare.""  I didn't ask for medium rare. I asked for rare and I was given well done/burnt. No offer to make things better, even though I verbally told him it wasn't what I wanted. Will never go back to this location.

116,Christy H.,"Taylor, TX",0,1,,1.0,2016-10-29,"Great food, terrible service. We were probably some of the first customers on a Sunday morning and were seated promptly. Our waiter, Bryce, showed up to take our drink orders. Those took a while but we did not mind because he brought water while we waited. We really didn't need appetizers, but he pressed us to try the fried macaroni & cheese. Talked it up really well, so we figured we'd try. They never came. We placed our orders for entrees and they were delivered by another server, and we asked him about the fried macaroni & cheese. He told us he would ask about it. One in our party had asked for a side dish that never came. Next time Bryce came around we again asked about the macaroni & cheese. He said, ""They overcooked the first round, that will be right out."" No, it wasn't. He came back and apologized because at this point, we are halfway through eating our entree and hadn't received our appetizer. He told us that he felt so bad he wouldn't charge us and kept promising that it was on its way out. No, it wasn't. The food that we did receive was actually delicious, but we were still wondering about that fried macaroni & cheese. One in our party asked for her leftovers to be boxed up and she also ordered a slice of cheesecake to go. We waited for more than 20 minutes for the food to be returned to us, and even then we had to ask for it. Bryce brought our check and it had the macaroni & cheese on it. But they had forgotten to charge us for the cheesecake, so we figured it was close enough a wash and decided to not make a big deal. We added a tip (believe it or not) and signed the ticket, and then Bryce shows up with a new ticket, apologizing for having added the macaroni & cheese that we never received and that he said he would pay for himself, and this time the cheesecake has been added. It made our bill about $4 less. OK. And when we asked where the macaroni & cheese was he said, ""They are boxing it up now and it will be right out."" Well, that became the theme quote of our entire trip. And at this point, we're still waiting on the boxed up leftovers to be returned to us. And when we asked again they looked at us like we were speaking a foreign language and then we were told, ""We had a spill, we're getting that right out."" And we had to wonder if they had thrown it in the trash and dug it out again. Did I mention that the fried macaroni and cheese never came?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=120,2.44,2.59,2.59,2.148,2.5300000000000002

125,Jody W.,"Arlington, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-11-23,"Nov.22,2016 Group of 20 of us went to celebrate a birthday. Arrives around 6 only to find out we had 45 minutes to an hour wait. Finally after going back and asking we were seated at 7:30pm. Drinks took well over 15 minutes to arrive to our table and some did not receive their ice tea until after their meal came out. Another 15-20 minutes before our orders were taken, all but one meal finally came out and we began eating thinking his plate would come out soon. Took (12) minutes and asking twice where his food was before he got this messy looking plate of chicken and biscuit. One couple ordered wine which the waiter opened at the table or at least made an attempt to. We watched as his co-workers stood in the background laughing at him and never making an attempt to help him. Finally our birthday boy took the wine from him and opened it. By the time all is said and done we are still waiting to pay our bills at 10:30pm. This is not because we lolly gagged around. This is how slow the service and restaurant was. I do not blame our waiter, come to find out he had been there for only (2) weeks. He waited our table single handed while his co-workers watched, never making an attempt to help him with refilling our drinks, pick up the dirty dishes or even pick up the menus. I cannot believe management was so blind they could not see how hard this young man was struggling at our table and how long we had been there. And for the rest of the staff that displayed this behavior, shame on you all. I have had better service at McDonalds. The top of the evening is when we ordered cheesecake of course and they don't have original or fresh strawberry cheesecake. WTH this is a cheesecake factory, you are obviously having a busy evening, we are a crowd of 20 you know the odds of someone going to order original cheesecake is high and you come out and tell us it is frozen.

However, what was the major turnoff for me was payment. I gave our waitress 2 gift cards - 1 for $50 and the other had around $5 remaining on it.  I included my CC for the overage cost.  So she returns with the receipt and hands it to me. I open it and find the merchant copy that simply showed the total charges to my CC and I quickly signed and tipped. Then I looked at the other receipts which showed a more detailed break down along with a receipt that said the approx $5 gift card did not have sufficient funds. It was frustrating that she didn't mention it when she came back.  I would have liked to known what happened to the balance on the gift card.  Not cool!!!  I felt like scratching out her tip to make up what got lost on the gift card, but thought it would be just as tacky as her not telling me.  She never came back by and I didn't want to drag my friends through the time it would take to try to speak to a manager so definitely has been turnoff to have 2 negative visits in a row.

Jon and I came here the other night while we were having a little Fort Worth Date Night. We made the short walk over from Sundance Square and asked where we could order a slice to go, the hostess pointed us towards the Bakery Counter, which was surrounded by people, two of which were in line. The display case was immaculate, so many different flavors to choose from. After some careful consideration, and a fair amount of debate, we decide to split the Oreo Dream Extreme Slice.  The amount they charge for a slice or full cheesecake is absolutely heinous! Then again, it is specialty cheesecakes from a large chain restaurant, what did we expect?  The wait wasn't too bad, a bit slow for just getting a slice of cake, but it was evening/dinner time, so it's understandable that there would be a little wait. Thankfully we were in and out in around 20 mins or less. The only improvement I can think to suggest is to set up some kind of line or at least rope off a little section for people to wait for the bakery. There was a lot of traffic going by the counter, which was breaking up the line and people waiting at the counter. Pretty much just another layer of confusion that can be avoided.  After the short walk back to Sundance Square, we found an abandoned bench and went to work on our shared dessert. The cheesecake was absolutely fabulous. The Oreo Dream consists of layers of fudge cake and Oreo mousse, whole Oreo cookies in a layer of signature cheesecake and topped with milk chocolate icing, whipped cream on the side with a chocolate biscuit cookie. I felt it was a little heavy on the chocolate icing, which was thick and sickly sweet, but the cheesecake was so rich, creamy and filled with tasty Oreos.  It's been a while since I've eaten Cheesecake Factory, but the cheesecake is definitely as good as I remember.

Lastly, we did. It get the usual bread basket and reminded her after our food came. The whole thing was so off putting I couldn't even enjoy my salad. Asked for a to go box and she did offer to box it up but I only wanted to put 1/2. Just bring me the freaking box I want to get out of here already! Paying $40 for lunch at a place you expect consistency is super frustrating. In the end they took off the cake and coffee so it was $25 for a salad I won't eat because the chicken was dry and the avocado was left off (yes she brought it after I waited to ask).

The service was spot on, the location handy, and the food simply could not have been better. Of course, I am basing this on one visit only. My wife and I shared the lunch portion of the herb crusted salmon with asparagus and carrots. The salmon was just perfect, tender, not too fishy, and the spices and herb crusting were perfect. It was placed on three large asparagus spears, cooked to absolute perfection. How they got them cooked to where they are not too soft or too crispy, I don't know. But they were just perfect. The side bowl of carrots were some of the best carrots I have had. They were not over cooked and the flavor of the carrots was genuine. We ordered the Adams peanut butter fudge ripple cheesecake for desert. I must say, this is absolute perfection in every way. I am not the biggest cheesecake fan. This has just enough peanut butter whipping on top with caramel and fudge to balance out the cheesecake flavor. The best cheesecake I think I've ever had.

We sat with empty drinks for 15 minutes, and as she ""checked on us"" while walking by our table, I asked for refills. Food came out, and it was great. Because of our absent waitress, my salad plate sat on the table the entire time, along with all of our dinner plates and empty glasses. From the time our glasses were placed on the table, to the time we signed our check, not one thing was bused from our table (which was a 6 top booth with 5 children and 2 adults).

170,Ken T.,"Arlington, TX",113,48,14.0,2.0,2017-09-04,A long time fan of CF I date back to the original location in Beverly Hills and have dined at many of their locations. This one has been a big disappointment on all 3 visits.  My family of 7 went last night upon all my rave reviews and I felt embarrassed. The bread came out and was cold and stale and should have been thrown out hours earlier. I ordered the Steak Diane and it arrived with the entree in disarray on half of the plate. The server said they were out of mashed potatoes but would have some soon. Seriously??? How do you run out of mashed potatoes?  Why would you even serve half of an entree to begin with? The entrees all arrived sporadically (not together) and my niece also got a partial plate minus the mashed potatoes. My sister had the Santa Fe salad which had wilted lettuce but tasted good nonetheless. The presentations lacked the pop that is the CG signature. My favorite cheesecake is the Lemon Meringue.  Mine came out looking like it just emerged from the frozen food case at Albertsons. No garnish and leaning. Nothing like the pristine presentations online or served at the other locations.  If the server hadn't been so good and worked so hard I would have stepped away to speak with the manager.  A last note is that usually along with the beautiful elegance of the CF the serving staff is usually equally polished and fresh faced.  One of the servers was extremely disheveled and looked as if he'd been sleeping in his clothes. This store is far from the CF standards and a huge disappointment when compared to their other locations. For future visitors I suggest going to one of their other locations and plan to be wowed.  It probably won't happen at this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth,2.76,2.73,2.73,2.152,2.742

I've eaten here several times but the last time we just orded -Crispy Chicken Costoletta: lightly breaded crispy sauteed chicken breast on a lemon butter sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus - tuscan chicken from the ""Skinylicious"" menu: grilled chicken breast on top an abundance of cherry tomatoes, artichokes, capers, and Ferro Definitely had left overs. I'd order both again, but there are still so many other items I want to try on their vast menu.  Also, if you're also not a cheesecake person but want dessert, I'd definitely recommend the strawberry short cake. It's topped with vanilla ice cream and plenty of fresh strawberries (none of those preserved syrupy squishy strawberries). Definitely enough to share.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth,2.56,2.67,2.67,,2.6260000000000003

The food was good and so was the service. It was a Tuesday night and they didn't have much of a crowd.

13,Sarah T.,"Arlington, TX",1,45,46.0,2.0,2017-12-12,"This location always has a wait so we were surprised to be able to walk in and be seated right at noon. The server was nice and informed us the bread was in the oven. It took 15-20 minutes for the bread to arrive. The worst part was waiting around 45 minutes for Chicken Alfredo and Eggplant Parmesan. It was delivered by another server who said ""thanks for the patience we're slammed"". The Chicken Alfredo had been sitting for quite some time. The bowl was hot and the noodles were hard and stuck together. The Alfredo was runny with no flavor. My husband asked me to take a bite and I could barely eat it. My eggplant Parmesan wasn't very warm and was mostly breading. The noodles were not cooked all the way either. The reason we gave 2 stars was because the manager did take off the Alfredo. (But not that $3 Diet Coke he had to drink to wash the few bites he took down). The wait for food was a little Long for a downtown location, not a good Work lunch unless you can give an extra 30 minutes.  The food was terrible which neither of us ate. For the price tag not worth the visit. $30 for 2 drinks and one meal we didn't eat(we did tip the server- she didn't cook it).  We love Fort Worth and have had good experiences at other CCF, But we won't be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=20,2.56,2.66,2.66,,2.62

9,T S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,1.0,2017-12-21,"Simply put. This was a thorough waste of my money. I was actually sitting at the table and couldn't wait to get to Yelp on this experience. I paid $21.00 for a mountain of regularly tasting angel hair pasta and 5 undersized shrimp.....5.... 1,2,3,4......5 unimpressive sized shrimp. When I inquired about the mountain of pasta and the 5 shrimp garnishment, I was meant with an air of ""so what""... I tried to ration the shrimp for the ridiculous ratio of pasta, but I actually said ""Phuck it. I'm not wasting my time with this.""... I eat out a lot at the various restaurants downtown for lunch and dinner, and I can't remember the last time I said that I should've just gave my money to the panhandler who said he would work for beer!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=20,2.52,2.6,2.6,,2.568
8,Jia S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-21,We've been waiting for three hours in the store and checking in with the staff every several minutes. The store gives our table away right in front of us after three hours of waiting. We did get four appetizers in the house.

1,Katie A.,"Vestal, NY",116,33,12.0,2.0,2017-12-27,"Okay if I did not have previous good experiences this would be a 1 star. So do know that I have had good experiences here but this one was so hilariously awkwardly bad I had to yelp it. I recently went to Cheesecake Factory with a few friends for dessert.  Our server John was great came promptly to take our order  and was friendly courteous and professional. Sadly enough another young man delivered our cheesecake. At that point one of the guys in our party asked him hey something's on the side of my cup do you know what it is and the server looked at it and just responded ""A booger... Enjoy"" and walked off. The entire table set in awkward silence with awkward laughter. No one could believe that a server had just honestly said that there was a booger on his cup even jokingly and then walked away without offering to fix it or get him a new glass of something to drink. He was very cocky and acted like the world just loved and adored him.  We talked to young woman who was very kind at the hostess desk who promptly got us a new drink.  Then the cocky young man came back over like nothing had happened and just said ""hey can I get you anything or can I do anything for you?"" His tone was dripping with sarcasm and attitude. As the guys at the table began to say that it was really rude and in poor taste the waiter just begin to make excuses and said oh I was just joking it's not really a booger. We all knew that it was a joke it was just very poor taste.  Bottom line he was rude and continued to be unprofessional.  His tone that he used with his poor excuse of an apology was haughty and his demeanor whenever he came back to apologize was just even more rude. The server's apology was steeped with excuses of his bad day as if that would make being rude to a paying customer okay when we were nothing but kind to start with. I understand having a bad day but I don't appreciate you taking it out with poor humor towards me or my friends. It is distasteful and disrespectful.   The manager did comp the drink and one slice of cheesecake.  Which was a kind gesture on her part. (Also another reason for 2 stars instead of 1 star)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth?start=20,2.4,2.58,2.58,,2.508
165,Lauren D.,"Fort Worth, TX",102,27,5.0,5.0,2017-12-28,"My first time ever at a cheesecake factory was this Christmas eve. Because of the day, my family and i expected a long wait. To our surprise, we were sat immediately. As a table of 5, we had a booth with a chair on the end which was fine with us. Our waitress quickly greeted us, and continued to provide great service throughout our dinner. Our food was all great and we loved the bread they served as well. Personally, I ordered something that was new to the menu, chicken Riesling, and it was amazing. Afterwards, I had to order a cheesecake, some chocolate tuxedo cheesecake which was to die for. Overall we were extremely happy with our service, food and dining experience. I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth,2.56,2.62,2.62,,2.596

Unfortunately, when I visited this location on 1/6 in the afternoon, I was told that they are out of flatbreads. Very disappointing.  Restaurant was not very clean either. Seems to be poorly managed.

169,Lindsey B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,3.0,1.0,2018-01-08,"Went to dinner this evening with my husband and son. Had a great meal and our waitress was very attentive... we paid our bill and waited for our to-go boxes, I went to use the restroom before heading home. As I walked into the woman's restroom, a smell hit me. I assumed someone was in the stall using the restroom, okay whatever no problem... it happens. As I go to walk into an open stall I find feces smeared all over the toilet and floor. I look down and realize I'm standing in it. As I walk backwards out of the stall, I see it's ALL OVER THE FLOOR. I quickly leave the bathroom to find a manager. An older gentleman on duty whom was the manager this evening came up to me. I quietly let him know how upset I was and the condition of the woman's restroom. His response- I kid you not, was ""sorry about that, I'll let someone know to go clean it"" and walked away! I spent $90 at this location on a meal that I had to drive home with someone else's feces on my brand new shoes. PITIFUL EXCUSE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT ONCE DID HE OFFER TO ADJUST OUR BILL OR OFFER DRY CLEANING SERVICES FOR MY SHOES- OR EVEN A BAG TO PUT THEM IN. When I called back up there to ask for cooperate's number, Vanessa the other manager apologized and said she was aware of the incident since had to go clean it- also acted like it wasn't a big deal. Said she would have to talk to her GM to see about possibly getting my shoes cleaned but other than that, she couldn't do much else other than apologize. I'm contacting the cooperate office and news stations about my horrible treatment if the GM does not contact me within 24hrs.

158,Mel S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,3.0,2018-01-09,Disappointed with initial service by the lady seating us. We noticed the booth seats and floor were significantly dirty with food particles and she simply ignored us when we told her by walking away while we wiped off the seats ourselves. The waitress was nice enough to sweep the area for us when we brought it to her attention. The waitress was good and the food is always well made so these qualities brought up the rating to a 3 star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth,2.48,2.57,2.57,,2.534

164,Aileen S.,"Azle, TX",0,9,,1.0,2018-01-11,"This was probably on my top five restaurants due to their extensive menu, service, and desserts. However, last evening, around 5pm, on a Wednesday the restaurant was a zoo. We waited about 20-30 minutes to be seated, another 10-15 minutes for a waitress, 5-10 minutes for drinks, and finally ordered dinner. We had a fish dinner, a meatloaf dinner, and a pasta plate without meat, which our waitress repeated back to us. Our waitress never checked on us. The meals arrived finally and the pasta plate had chicken in it. We sent it back. At this point the manager Katrina came over to confirm the error. Katrina also made an excuse that they were busy with a large group. That's really not the customers problem, that's a management issue The other meals got cold before the pasta plate was served. This meal took over two hours to have. If you want a nice dinner, I don't recommend this restaurant. Very poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-worth,2.36,2.56,2.56,,2.48
