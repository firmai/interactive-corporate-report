111,Tom S.,"Fresno, United States",13,13,4.0,1.0,2012-01-19,"Not sure what was going on at this location, as I've never had a bad experience at other Applebee's locations in Fresno. My wife and I entered the restaurant and were promptly seated at a table. We patiently waited for, get this, 15 minutes, and no one ever came by to even ask for our drink order. We looked around the restaurant and noticed that people only had their drinks at many other tables and there were almost no waiters to be found. I would never go back to this location. We walked out after realizing that if it took 15 minutes and we still hadn't even seen a waiter, it would be hours before we'd ever get drinks or our food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=120,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

The ""Mac and Cheese"" was nothing more than a serving of Kraft from the box, for $5.50. I was very disappointed with the quality of the food served.

134,Kim C.,"Fresno, United States",26,98,92.0,1.0,2015-04-18,"Came here late on a Thursday night. We were seated in a dine in area due to the fact we had a few kids in our party. Waitress was friendly. I wish I had good stuff to say but sadly, I do not.  Pros:  1. Love the late night 1/2 off selected apps. Portion sizes were good and hard to go wrong with mozzarella sticks, boneless wings and chicken quesadillas.  2. There is a tablet type thing on each table that helps keep the kids occupied (this will also be mentioned as a con below). Apparently, it allows customers to reorder items and make requests.  Cons:  1. Waitress didn't come by often to offer refills. We were there about 1.5h and she came by 3 times. Once to take initial order, then to take actual order and then to bring bill. The other times we flagged down other staff for assistance. 2. The great tablet thing I mentioned, well come to find out, it costs $1 (per game! but apparently they just changed it to a flat fee or something. Not too sure according to manager who was also unaware/surprised that NO ONE told us about a surcharge and a little confused about the updates). Would be nice if the machine or the waitress gave us a heads up with a ""btw, if you want to play games, they will be yada yada yada"".  3. My friend saw a staff member use the restroom and left without washing his hands. *GROSSSSSSS*! Ok, yes, the team member was no longer on the clock as after he walked out of restroom, he walked to parking lot and left. We mentioned this to manager and she was trying to tell us that ""oh he's off the clock and I understand your concern."" Ok, yes, I agree he was off the clock. But people are creatures of habit. Im sure he didn't just not wash his hands this one time cause he's clocked out. Usually if someone doesn't wash their hands, its cause they normally don't. Luckily, we had already eaten and paid for our meal, otherwise I would have got up and left. I'm sorry manager, even if he was off, that is UNACCEPTABLE. We will not be coming back to this establishment and wouldn't recommend it either.

50,Ariel S.,"Clovis, United States",0,6,3.0,2.0,2015-06-27,"I've been to this Applebee's location several times and I definitely experienced better service than the last time I went. For Father's Day 2015, we went to this restaurant in the early evening, it wasn't packed yet. Waiting time was short to be seated (about 10 minutes).  The problem began when we were assigned a waitress. Man, that girl was hardly friendly. Come to think of it, the waiters at the other tables weren't happy looking either. Our waitress was impatient when asking what we wanted to drink; acted like it was so much trouble repeating what sodas they have. I asked if they had Dr. Pepper and she said ""nope."" Uhhhh... Just one word, really? Didn't even give suggestions. When my father was ordering, she didn't explain the 2 for $25(?) deal thing properly so it left him confused thinking he was ordering right. Later on in the service she realized her mistake and tried to fix it. While taking our menus away, she dropped one on the table, and didn't seem to care that it bothered us. ""Oh sorry about that."" Her apology barely seemed believable.  We didn't have silverware at our table. Guess it wasn't common sense that a family of three needs extra napkins instead of the just one that is wrapped around the eating utensils.  The waitress wasn't serving food to a lot of tables, sooooo I don't know what her excuse was for forgetting what my table ordered. When she brought the food out, she said the name of the dish in a questioning manner as to ask who the plate was for. That's the job of the waiter to remember.  If it was up to me, she would have gotten zero tips, but my parents tipped her anyway.  Moving on from the waiter area....the food was good. Double Crunch Shrimp is a little hard to bite through, but that's because it's....double the crunch as the name implies. French fries good. Classic boneless buffalo chicken was good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4?start=60,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.864,1.8000000000000003

I also ordered buffalo boneless wings and it tasted like they took the bbq ones (probably all they had ready made) tossed them lightly in some buffalo sauce and called it a day. My husband got the Riblet platter and that was a sick sad joke. Order was scheduled for 10:40 he didn't get it till 11. Just all kinds of wrong.

The waitress that served is was very nice and kept our drinks full during our duration of our stay and she was on top of her service. I ordered a sandwich which had turkey, ham, cheese and bacon in it. When our food arrived we began to eat. I notice that I was chewing on something that wasn't breaking down like food normally should so I pulled it out of my mouth to inspect what it was. I found it was a waxy paper like material. When I examined my sandwich I noticed that whoever prepared my sandwich forgot to remove the wax paper that separates the cheese slices. This left me without an appetite.

My favorite is the boneless wings--every new city I visit I always like to check out the wing joints they have $5.00 for 10-12 boneless wings during happy hour. Good environment for dating and usually there are competitions  which keep it fun for friend hangouts. The only downside is to get food on happy hour prices you are required to dine in-- this isn't good if you have older family at home or people who don't like to go out to dine to enjoy the quality food of Applebees and the convenience of happy hour prices. Many times I've taken trips here trying to get management to bend on this rule because my mom really wants to try their food but doesnt make alot of money and she doesnt like to dine out. I go to the business for a quick wing fix, eat them, and go.. I don't see why more profit is gained from sitting there as opposed to taking your food to go, you'll still be back for more.

Twelve of us arrived, and a genuine effort was made to accommodate us, to seat us together at an extended table. To further complicate it (for the server), the billing was divided to three checks. A situation like this requires an organized individual, and our server, Isaac, was a wizard.  I was seated beneath a speaker, and the music's volume made it impossible to participate in the conversation, so I asked that the volume be turned down. My request was accommodated, and I appreciated that.  Isaac added to the occasion with his energy, good humor and attentive service. Our orders were hastily, tastily prepared and we enjoyed our time. Isaac overheard the birthday wishes, and some of the staff sang a ""Happy Birthday"" to one member of our party, and Isaac has an amazing voice!   Our visit was fun, the food was properly prepared (consistent with other properly managed Applebee Restaurants) and that rates at least 3 starts.

There are certain items on the menu I enjoy, and my recent pregnancy craving is the brownie with the icecream. It's delicious.  So I get this brownie to go about half an hour before they're supposed to close. They don't warm it up, they give it to me frozen and tell me to microwave it. Okay, whatever. I get home, and the fudge is everywhere because they just threw the container in the bag carelessly. I was pissed. I tried eating a couple bites but my pregnancy rage took over and I was like, F this stupid brownie and the fudge that spilled everywhere, I'm taking it back and getting a refund. So I get back a few minutes before they close and ask for a refund. They were surprisingly a lot more accommodating than I expected. The manager asked if I wanted the food remade, I said no just give me my money. Then he offered to remake the food and give me a gift card. I was like, I don't know. He insisted on doing both, so I said okay. And he apologized a lot, and so did the guy that handed me the food. They were all nice and it made me feel a lot better.

Walked in, no one in the front. So we sat down waiting for someone to come in the front & a group of 4 came in right behind us. It was like no one noticed that ""customers"" walked in. A waitress was at the front desk & organizing the menus but she doesn't say anything, no greet whatsoever. The group after us got up & puts their name down & then I walked up, and a group of 5 just walked in, & got their name written down, then my name next. She said ""there was an hour wait"" which turned out to be like 10 mins really. I don't drink margaritas, but can't pass up on $1 drinks so I really don't know there were different versions of their margarita special. My first order of margarita was the non-special price but the waiter was able to switch it the $1 ones. It would been a little helpful, if they mention the margarita special when they asked for drinks earlier so I wouldn't have been confused on my part. I don't like that happy hour is only in the bar, the bar gets too packed and crowded & I prefer a table to eat my food.

My husband got the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  Both were super yummy!  That 2/$20 has options to come with a salad, which we ordered.  Because I cannot eat seeds, the server had to keep the tomato's and cucumbers and gluten-laden croutons off my salad, which he did. Also discussed a dairy-free salad dressing options and decided on their vinagarette.  When the salads were delivered, our waiter came by, barely a few seconds later, and looked at my salad and he said ""your salad just looks so plain...   lets put our heads together so can I get something to cheer up your salad""!!!  So we decided a small amount of shredded mixed cheese would be ok and some fresh cooked chopped bacon.  He brought those in separate little ramekin dishes.  I now had the perfect salad for me and I was so happy!  I tell ya--- most other places I have been do not give such nice, considerate, personalized customer service!!!  Applebees is fast becoming my favorite place!!!   I think Applebees creates a culture where nice waiters like Jeff can flourish in their career.  We frequently have evening appointments in Clovis and we will be back to this place for dinner.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-clovis-4,1.8,1.89,1.89,,1.854
