19,Tamara M.,"Cleveland, OH",9,25,3.0,5.0,2015-10-28,"Literally their 3rd day being open and this is officially my husband's and my spot! We had the buffalo chicken mini deep dish pizza which was pretty decent for deep dish. The barbecue, buffalo and ranch mixture was interesting and delicious. We also had the new sriracha chicken bacon Mac and cheese which is absolutely a must have, considering the perfectly al dente pasta and perfect proportion of bacon and broccoli. Even more so, the decadent macadamia nut pizookie came highly recommended and is confirmed by this casual couple! Lol! As with any three day open, there were hiccups such as slower service, only one olive in my dirty martini that they couldn't balance on a tray, and a few other  awkward moments. However, the casual yet upscale ambiance of the restaurant is fitting for the area and incredibly welcoming. This chain is definitely recommended and is worth the slightly higher than average pricing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2?start=60,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124
89,Mike N.,"Paris, France",0,1,,1.0,2015-10-30,"I have a group of 12, so no simple request on an opening weekend. I called ahead and spoke with a staff member who informed me that they don't take reservations until after 2 weeks of being open . understandable, so I ask if they think there is a chance they could accomodate. Without hesitation the staff member says ""yes come over and we can get you in"". I arrive and am told it would be a 3 hour wait..... and get a look like I am stupid for even being there. Not a great first impression..... as I was leaving to try and find a place for 12 again, I hear the staff making snarky comments.... A lot of things will need to change before I dare try this place again.

Service was fantastic. They even text you when your table is ready. The greeters were welcoming; the servers were helpful and timely; the other staff checked on our table occasionally too!

It was delicious, but I suggest ordering it with the dressing on the side. The salad was big enough for two meals.  Our server was great. She checked in on us many times. We were a party of three and after ordering it only took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive (the restaurant was packed).  I wasn't able to try one of their famous pizookies.

80,Heather R.,"Akron, OH",12,1,,1.0,2015-11-11,I've been to this restaurant four times since opening.  I am a huge fan of B.J.'s Brewhouse but this restaurant has some serious problems. Visit 1 - 2 people ordered veggie burgers.  Both were given turkey burgers even though veggie burgers had been rung in by the server Visit 2 was fine. Visit 3 - one person's order was never rung in Visit 4 - back to the turkey burger instead of veggie burger problem again. These were all lunch times so three of the four times people left with takeout food instead of eating in the restaurant even after being there for an hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2?start=40,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436
73,Bob P.,"North Royalton, OH",16,11,6.0,5.0,2015-11-15,"Whoda thunk that a chain restaurant would serve some of the best chowder I've ever had. We decided to take a drive to Akron on an unusually warm November day to check out the newest brew pub in the area.  As a national chain, I didn't expect much...I was wrong. The place was hopping and they told us to expect a 20-minute wait.  No problem we planned to enjoy one of their branded brews while waiting.  But we didn't have a chance as we were paged in less that five minutes. Our server, Matt, appeared immediately and gave us a rundown of their own beers plus several from local breweries.  I ordered their Piranha Pale Ale and my wife had the Harvest Hefeweizen.  Both were tasty. I've had a tease for clam chowder for months so I decided to try theirs along with their pepperoni personal pizza (don't tell the trainer).  My wife ordered the Back and Bleu Burger. The chowder was the best I've had in years and the pizza was excellent.  My wife's burger was also first-rate.  You can't go wrong with any of these. The service was excellent.  Although the place was packed we didn't have to wait for anything.

28,Sarah S.,"Brunswick, OH",0,1,,1.0,2015-11-17,"I wish I could give this no stars. I have to say that I had the worst experience at this restaurant. First of all, I found it rude that we were asked about being a member of the rewards club before even being sat, that makes it seem that we get 2nd rate service before we even get a table. Then we sat down and our server, couldn't tell you his name came over and you can tell he was just trained, maybe 2 weeks ago- total corporate nonsense too! Anyways, he asked us what we wanted to drink and my husband got the ""red""beer, I can't remember the name, but it was SOO basic. I just got a water and an iced tea, which neither were refilled, and the ice tea was almost $2.50!! My husband was actually never offered another beer or anything else to drink either. Then it came to our food, I am a picky eater and on a strict diet, so I was able to order a lunch option because everything else was pretty heavy. Well I order, and asked for my modifications, and I still ended up with the wrong dish.  My husband got a burger, which was just grease... no flavor, and once my food got straightened out their first response was to buy us dessert, which I can't eat- so they did take my food off the menu because it was wrong, but it was also not good, I left most of it behind and so did my husband. So our bill was about 20 bucks and we still ended up stopping off at another restaurant so I could get a side of veggies and a salad and he could another beer!!! I would NOT recommend this place to anyone and I can tell you our friends and I frequent new fun places... this is not going to be one of them! Good luck but you lost a big group of avid drinkers and a big family who loves to go out to eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2?start=80,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

Ordered  a vodka & tonic which wasn't bad but i saw our drinks just sitting at the bar for way to long. I ordered the prime rib dip.. The waitress then came over and said they were out of the bread for the sandwich and ask if  they could put it on a hamburger bun; the food was good. But how do you run out of stuff in the middle of the week? My brother ordered another beer and that like our drinks before just sat at the bar. After we said we didn't want desert they just brought the bill didn't even ask if I wanted another drink.

81,Gahan A.,"Akron, OH",2,5,2.0,3.0,2015-11-25,"My bestie and I stopped by for the first time last night. Overall the experiance was just ok. The restaurant is new in our area so I would imagine the staff would be upbeat and pleasant but it seemed everyone was just going thru the motions...maybe they were just ready to go home, that's the feel I got. We were seated and quickly greeted by our waitress. She immediately rambled off 3 beers for recommendations, no ""hey, how ya doin'"", just straight to the drinks, names we've never heard or had any idea or detail about. We asked for a moment to decide and after browsing the extensive drink menu,  she did offer me a tester of a cider I was on the fence about. The Berry Burst Cider was pretty good, if you aren't really into beer try it.  We decided to order the lettuce wraps (meh), stuffed mushrooms (bland), root beer ribs and shrimp tacos. The Root Beer Glazed Ribs were sooo yummy. The sauce was sticky and sweet which I loved. You get 5 bones and they are the babiest babyback ribs, smaller than ribs in a kids meal, delicious nonetheless. We had to ask for small plates and silverware. All the food came out at the same time except for the tacos, which the waitress zoomed by and said will be it shortly. We ate and chatted patiently waiting...no tacos. Our waitress stopped by to get our empty plates and asked us did we get our tacos :(. After waiting almost 10 mins out came the tacos...the late, dry, flavorless tacos. Unapologetic about the late entrée, onto the sales pitch of 3 different desserts. Now this is where BJs did not miss! OMG the Pizooki Trio was amazing! You can choose your 3 which we had the seasonal Pumpkin, Salted Caramel and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, each were heavenly. The waitress dropped off the bill with the dessert and said no rush enjoy.  So in all, the dessert is amazing, food is mediocre at best and service was as if waitresses no longer care about wanting tips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2?start=40,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003
21,Thom K.,"East Sparta, OH",0,3,,1.0,2015-12-05,"So I used the BJ's mobile app to register my party and the app responded with an 85 minute wait. Not bad since I had a 45 minute drive to the restaurant. When we arrived we were told that the computer had crashed so I had to give my name for the wait list and my cell # for a text when my table was ready, and a 30-45 minute wait. After 30 minutes I was told that it would be 30 more minutes. After 30 more minutes I was told it would be 15-30 more minutes. Luckily for me, the 3rd person in our party had arrived before us and put her name in and after a 90 minute wait we were seated. I never did get that text I was promised. We could have left but we were all interested in how it would play out. Not even an apology! The host was of no help, the manager was of no help. The waiter was great, the food was very good (or were we just very hungry?). I would be leery of trusting the app, maybe call ahead instead.

27,Bridget M.,"Solon, OH",1,14,,2.0,2015-12-06,"I heard about BJ's in Columbus, so I was excited to try it when it opened in Fairlawn. I have to say I was rather disappointed. We did call ahead seating for 7:30, came and checked in around 7:25. At 7:50, I went to the hostess stand where I had one tell me ""yeah I don't know what they're doing"" and the other tell me ""you'll just have to wait for a table to open"". I know it was very busy, but I did call ahead seating for that reason. So we finally get seated, our waitress comes over completely disheveled, we split a bbq pizza, which we had to tell her 4-5 times as she kept writing buffalo pizza... The food was nothing to really write home about, the pizza was mostly dough and the chicken definitely had not a lot of flavor. Then, the famous pizookie. It's a warmed up cookie with ice cream, delicious, but honestly can be made at home for a quarter of the price.

The menu aims to be a cut above standard bar food (think siracha infused brussel sprouts) but  wound up being just okay. I had the parmesan encrusted chicken prepared with heart stopping quantity of butter. The chicken was a little underdone; unfortunately I didn't discover this until well into my dish.

29,Marie N.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",0,1,,2.0,2016-01-14,"The only reason I am giving BJ's two stars is because the beer was good, and the food was OK. The service was absolutely awful and that is one of my biggest pet peeves. I hate complaining because I have been in the food service industry all my life, but we all were just so disappointed. We had a larger group for a birthday party. To a server, this is great news because this is your chance to make some tips; what you signed up to be a server for. Instead, we overheard snotty remarks about how big our group was and the lack of smiles and friendliness was not overlooked. It took over an hour to receive my food specifically, so I ate while everyone else was finished without complaint. I understand having a big group may take a while for food orders, but at least apologize and if you made a mistake, which had to have been the case with my order, own up to it. Instead, I got no apology, no explanation, no manager coming over to diffuse the situation, no comp of anything, no check up to see how my food came out, or anyone else in our party for that matter; just a throw of the plate in front of me when my food was finally presented. I can honestly say, even if the food was fantastic and they had the best beer I've ever had, I would never go back there purely for the service. I want to have an enjoyable experience when I go out and spend my hard earned money; not sit there feeling like a ""burden"" to our server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2?start=80,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.216,3.2000000000000006

59,Mike P.,"Akron, OH",4,22,36.0,4.0,2016-01-14,We went here for lunch. There was a short wait for a table. I ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer and they were very good. The wife who normally would not touch them also liked them a lot. For lunch I had the brisket bacon burger and it was incredible. She had the French dip and was very pleased with it as well. The fries were hot and crispy but could be better. Service was fast but expect about 45 minutes from the time you walk in until you walk out. The food is a bit on the expensive side $10 and up for burgers however the quality is certainly worth it. I plan on going back tomorrow. So I went back and had the double burger this time.

70,Jessica D.,"Akron, OH",5,45,1.0,3.0,2016-01-15,"I think it just depends on the staff you get. I look around and some waiters seem to be entertaining their guests but the few times I've been here I've had total duds for waiters.  Let's start from getting seating. I have an app that takes up precious space on my phone. However, I don't really know what signing in on the apps gets you. One time I signed in and the app said wait time 45 minutes. So in 30 minutes we left and came in only to be greater with okay so it looks like it will be an hour and twenty minutes. We promptly left. The next time we used it the wait time was correct however people who got there and put their name in were seated before us so I have to question what the app really gives you. Next the menu/food. Though the menu is large, half of it is booze- pricey booze. 6 bucks for a beer- no thanks. We ordered an app at 10 bucks a pop the most recent time, after waiting 40 minutes, yes after 40 minutes our waiter finally came over and we got to ask where our app was. He was surprised that it wasn't there so we just cancelled it. I guess the one good thing is they text you when your table is ready so you know how gruelingly long you've been waiting for to eat minus the time it took to order. The food that did come out was alright not great. We've had the burgers, the pizza, salads and the veggie burgers.  We would probably recommend the burger 1st but gee doesn't Akron have enough burger places already?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2?start=40,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.2199999999999998,3.1200000000000006

47,Cortney R.,"Akron, OH",204,199,66.0,3.0,2016-02-29,"I have a lot to say about BJ's. Let's start off with the walk from the parking spaces to the building. If you park across the driving path, be careful! The cars come flying down the ramp from the mall parking lot and we had a close call when we were trying to cross. I think maybe it would be a good safety practice to put up a speed limit sign or paint in a cross-walk so there are no accidents. Once we approached the door, we noticed that the main entrance is a revolving door. I know there is some kind of energy savings with a revolving door but this one is the stuff of nightmares. If the waiting room is crowded, there will be people standing on the inside of the revolving door so when you go through it, you can't exit easily. Now, there are handicapped doors available to the side of the revolving door so I strongly urge you to use them if the restaurant is busy.  When we entered, I walked up to the hostess and told her there were two people in our party and gave her my name. She wanted my first name, last initial, and my phone number. I looked at her puzzled and she said, ""Oh, the phone number is so we can text you when your table is ready. Sorry, I'm assuming you've never been here before?"" She was correct, I had never been there before so I think she should ask if we would like a text when our table is ready instead of demanding customer phone numbers with no preface.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait but I don't think it was that long. When I got the text that our table was ready, I went back up to the hostess stand and she pointed behind her to the other hostess stand. Why two stands?? This is kind of confusing for a newcomer. So, the people at the second stand take you to your table. It takes up a lot of extra space that could be used to extra waiting room seating to eliminate the revolving door issue. Just sayin'. The host seated us at a cozy 2-person corner booth at the back of the restaurant. We were pretty happy about that! It was my husband's birthday so a little romantic spot to enjoy our meals was appreciated!  We looked over the drinks menu and ordered some unique brews. It's really cool that they have a lot of craft beers to choose from. They had a beer I had been looking for but hadn't ever found so I was very excited to order it. Next, we ordered our meals. I ordered the guacamole bacon burger and hubby ordered a different burger. The burgers came out and looked gorgeous! I really enjoyed my burger but it didn't enjoy me. Unfortunately, I was sick all night. I've never had a burger do me wrong like that, it was kinda disappointing because the flavor of the burger was pretty good. The fries were also good. I like the thin shoestring fries! I really wanted to order a salad from the healthier menu but I couldn't justify paying $14 for a salad. Overall, weird new experience. Not sure we'll be back.

She walked away without apologizing and we just stood there kind of questioning the door.. They had just opened a couple months prior.. Shouldn't they know their holiday hours? The manager came over and apologized and seated us and then proceeded to tell us the specials, walked away.. And no one came back for 15 minutes. Food was mediocre for how expensive some of the dishes are. Second time around I went with the same person, my fiancé, and I was just grabbing something small for lunch. My fiancé wasn't getting anything because he had eaten prior so he just got a water. No one wanted to help us at all. Service was so terrible that I did not leave a tip.

I ordered a glass of 14 Hands Merlot and a large deep-dish Five Meat pizza (extra cheese, please)!  I was able to relax and unwind before my dinner was served.  The pizza was served and placed on a brushed nickel structural tripod that elevated the pizza above the table-top (allowing for extra room underneath).  When Chelsea placed the tripod on the bar in front of me I knew the pizza was going to be big!   I will admit now that I have always been a fan of Pizza Hut's ""former"" pizza crust.  It was a typical foccacia-type pizza crust.  The pizza dough at BJ's is made like foccacia, with olive oil - crispy outside and warm, fluffy goodness inside - like a pillowy respite for the toppings to lay their tired, protein-infused heads on prior to being devoured.  Was the sauce a little sweet for my taste?  Yes, but that's what sells today.  Happily the pizza sauce is NOT the star of the show here... the crust and toppings are! The happy hour specials here apply to ""good"" wines too (not just house wines).  I ordered the brussel sprouts for Ray as an appetizer and hauled the remainder of the pizza home for his dinner/lunch. Dessert?  Monkey Bread pizza-thingie with vanilla bean ice cream on the side.  A gooey, cinnamon, chewy carbohydrate mouth party that I thoroughly enjoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2,2.44,2.44,2.44,3.152,2.44

We had pizza with no plates, didn't hear the specials until we were ready to order, passed us 5+ times after we had asked for water and boxes without giving us either and made our overall dining experience bad.

Though this was lunch so I could not partake in the beverages.  Our waitress was slow to get our orders but attentive otherwise. I had the seared Ahi Tuna salad. The cost was steep for the small amount of tuna...quite frankly disappointing. My salad was drenched in dressing...very soggy. I didn't really even eat half.

We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait. They took my cell# and I rec'd a text saying it would be a 25 min wait. TWO minutes later I rec'd a text saying my table was ready! It's a noisy restaurant with high ceilings and many tvs. The menu is many pages long, with 40 choices of beer on tap, I had an Irish Root Beer - excellent! I ate the grilled chicken alfredo and my daughter had the roast beef dip. Both were excellent and of good portion size. The service was slow, the waiter lacking skills. I asked for water; he brought one, for me; none for my daughter. When our drinks were empty he asked if we wanted refills. I would have had a 2nd, different drink, had he stuck around for my entire answer. When I answered no for a refill, he not only took off, lightning fast, but left the empty glasses on the table. He did return to ask if we wanted dessert. We declined and he left to get the checks. But, again, he left the dirty, empty plates on our table. After I paid and we left, the dirty, empty plates and glasses were still on the table. He never removed either of them.

My parents and I chose stuffed mushrooms as our appetizer and burgers for our meals. The food was cooked to perfection and I was sad when the meal was over. My only complaint is about the waitress.

40,Karl M.,"Orrville, OH",2,64,2.0,2.0,2017-05-29,"We went here last night, about 7:30. We were seated right away, no wait! Our waiter was Shannon, the menu is extensive, lots of choices in all categories. When the menu comes in a spiral binder it just says manufactured, portioned foodservice packs, prepared by less experienced people, ""food warmers"" using Turbo Chef microwave ovens. The service was sub par, we ordered a Supersalad with Cajun Shrimp, a glass of wine, a cup of hot tea, a bowl of claim chowder, and a Cesar salad, pretty simple. Our waiter Shannon didn't know anything about tea, we wanted decafe, he had to go ask someone else, he came back with Chamomile as a choice which we ordered. The wine arrived first with iced water, my wife declined the iced water and requested water no ice. Shannon reported all the mugs were dirty and needed to be washed, really who is running the back of the house,  no clean coffee mugs in a brew pub! 10 min. later the salads arrived, delivered by another good server, when the young server asked if we needed anything else, we replied with where's the hot tea? The young lady replied with a shrug of her shoulders "" I don't know you have to ask the waiter"" Wrong Answer, who is training these people?  Shannon came back and we asked about the tea, he replied he had to  push a tray of mugs into the dish washer, then asked what we were missing? The waiter should know what food arrives against what was ordered, we told him the soup! The tea arrives, I am already done with my salad which was okay, nothing to brag about. 3 min. past the soup arrives it isn't in a bread bowl like the picture in the menu and it is luke warm. If the soup is advertised in a bread bowl it should be served that way. If there is another option, the waiter should ask a qualifying statement like did you want it in a bread bowl or in a soup bowl? Then seconds later another bowl of soup arrives, which we didn't order, it is luke warm as well. If you are going for drinks, brews and the like this is probably a good place to go as they have a great selection,  the food is worth the price and the wait staff and back of the house are ill trained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-fairlawn-2,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

Mixed drinks were loaded, overflowing with ice- remember that from the last visit- so any ""deal"" was meaningless. Tortilla soup heavy on gelatinous, salty broth.
