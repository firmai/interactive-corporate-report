0,Mark R.,"Cypress, CA",221,462,1097,2.0,2012-03-10,"I just walked out after realizing that my experience would get worse as it progressed. The location is always busy since it is kind of like the only sit down restaurant in this D Gate area.  I waited for about 10 minutes when the hostess asked if 4 of us would like to sit together although being strangers.  We totally agreed and sat down to order.  We waited about good 10 minutes before some surfer looking dude came to take our order.  He was not in a good mood and we obviously threw him off totally with 4 strangers ordering together. 1 customer asked for his food to go with just water 1 customer asked for the same sandwich but stay 1 customer ordered salmon with hot water with lemon I ordered the same sandwich with diet coke So what happened next? 1 customer who asked for his food to go, got his food, paid and left 1 customer with the same sandwich with water wanted his sandwich faster since he had to catch a flight in 10 minutes, got his food and started eating 1 customer with salmon got his food, got his hot water with lemon and started eating as well Well.. well.. well... my food came out at the end, forgot about my diet coke and the waiter had the audacity to tell me that they ran out of the wheat bread so took the liberty to use the white bread instead.  He said I would have to wait about another 30 minutes for the wheat bread so the choice was mine.  At this point, I just walked out and went over to Quizno's. I just didn't have enough patience to deal with this young man or the restaurant. The table that came about 20 minutes after next to me got their food quicker than we did and was helped by the manager since they were so busy.   What was it about our stranger table that created this weird experience? Hm... note to myself: don't eat with strangers and avoid surfer looking dudes that are waiters?!??? LOL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atlanta,,,,,

2,Diane R.,"Alpharetta, GA",27,166,6,4.0,2012-11-21,"OK, I'm not a huge Chili's fan... but non-chain choices are limited at Hartsfield, for sure. At their To-Go counter, they offered a Chicken Enchilada soup for a reasonable price (don't remember, but about $5?) that was reasonably healthy. It was plenty for me, and it wasn't fast food!! I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atlanta,,,,,
1,Jennifer M.,"Atlanta, GA",133,10,1,1.0,2015-07-11,Ordered chicken tortilla soup and was so super salty my daughter couldn't eat it.
