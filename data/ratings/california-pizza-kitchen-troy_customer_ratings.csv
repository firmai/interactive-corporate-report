129,Anthony D.,"Royal Oak, United States",118,73,4.0,2.0,2012-06-12,"I only went here to take advantage of an American Express cash back offer.  I think it was something like spend $25 and get $10 back.  I wasn't too impressed overall and I don't think I would be back unless someone else was paying for it. The food itself is very mediocre.  I know I shouldn't expect much from a national chain like this, but I still ended up being disappointed.  The pizzas are small and expensive.  It was average at best.   The service was slow and crappy, and I really don't feel it was our server's fault.  It is clear to me that CPK values table turnover above anything else.  The moment any party would get up to leave, the bussers would swarm the table like locusts and get it prepared for the next group who was seated immediately.  This process seriously took less than 30 seconds.  This would be all fine and dandy if the servers and floor manager actually paid attention to the people who were already seated.  Unfortunately once you're seated, they no longer care. It took a while to get greeted by our server due to his section being hopelessly over-sat.  He didn't have time to wipe his ass, let alone pay enough attention to us. My girlfriend ordered a wine sampler, and the wine glasses were dirty.  One of them had a big gross lipstick print on the rim.  It didn't even look like the glass was washed. When we unrolled our silverware it looked pretty rough too.  We tried to flag down our server, but he was visibly overwhelmed and speedwalking from table to table.  We saw a manager talking to a group of bussers, presumably cracking the whip to increase table turnover.  When she walked by our table, we tried to flag her down as well.  She just kept walking and we never saw her again.  Eventually our server came back to check on us, and we informed him of our filthy glassware/silverware.  He apologized and quickly replaced it for us. In the end the server was able to get a manager to remove one of our appetizers from our total.  While that is a nice gesture, it's not enough to convince me to come back.  It's obvious to me where CPK's priorities lie, and it's not on customer service or food quality.

The crust was more like a fried chalupa rather than pizza crust and I didn't like it. The chicken was so puny that I dug through the mess on top just to make sure it was in there. The toppings were okay but again I wish it had pizza crust.  My husband had the pear gorgonzola thin crust pizza and said it was just okay. He said the pesto chicken pizza is much better.

22,Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2794.0,4.0,2014-05-10,"This was my first visit to California Pizza Kitchen and I had an okay time. At 2pm, we thought we would be able to get a table quickly. This was not the case. Oh well, we waited about 15 min which allowed us time to install the CPK app for a free ""small plate"". I felt like the service was a little slow here. Our waiter, Travis, was very friendly and patient. After we ordered, we expected to get the complimentary bread soon after. I was starving so I really wanted to eat something quick. However, after waiting for about 15 min, we decided to ask for it. After we did, it came shortly. For our free small plate, we got a shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread. This was the perfect size - four pieces for the four of us. It was quite tasty as well and super cute! We ordered the California club pizza, which is first baked with bacon, chicken, and cheese, and then topped with a salad, basil, and avocado. I found that the basil was too much as they were literally placed almost whole on top. I like basil, though, so it was ok for me, but I can imagine others not feeling the same. I really liked this pizza! We also got a White pizza and added bacon for $1.59. This was also quite good, very cheesy. I found that these pizza crusts got chewy and hard and difficult to eat after it got cold. We also got the fish taco. It only came with 2 tacos, some salsa, and chips. The fish was mahi-mahi and was quite good, obviously good quality fish. The portion was quite small for the price. I love coleslaw though, so this was pretty good for us to share. Overall, food was good and service was good. For a chain restaurant, I would say it met my expectations. I would definitely go again when I'm in the states and they had it somewhere nearby! Cheesecake Factory would be my choice before this place, though. Yay!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=20,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.3760000000000003,3.4400000000000004

102,Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2794.0,4.0,2014-10-05,"This was my first visit to California Pizza Kitchen and I had an okay time. At 2pm, we thought we would be able to get a table quickly. This was not the case. Oh well, we waited about 15 min which allowed us time to install the CPK app for a free ""small plate"". I felt like the service was a little slow here. Our waiter, Travis, was very friendly and patient. After we ordered, we expected to get the complimentary bread soon after. I was starving so I really wanted to eat something quick. However, after waiting for about 15 min, we decided to ask for it. After we did, it came shortly. For our free small plate, we got a shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread. This was the perfect size - four pieces for the four of us. It was quite tasty as well and super cute! We ordered the California club pizza, which is first baked with bacon, chicken, and cheese, and then topped with a salad, basil, and avocado. I found that the basil was too much as they were literally placed almost whole on top. I like basil, though, so it was ok for me, but I can imagine others not feeling the same. I really liked this pizza! We also got a White pizza and added bacon for $1.59. This was also quite good, very cheesy. I found that these pizza crusts got chewy and hard and difficult to eat after it got cold. We also got the fish taco. It only came with 2 tacos, some salsa, and chips. The fish was mahi-mahi and was quite good, obviously good quality fish. The portion was quite small for the price. I love coleslaw though, so this was pretty good for us to share. Overall, food was good and service was good. For a chain restaurant, I would say it met my expectations. I would definitely go again when I'm in the states and they had it somewhere nearby! Cheesecake Factory would be my choice before this place, though. Yay!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=20,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.44,3.6400000000000006

Looks like the chef forgot and put it in anyway and at the last moment removed it. When I opened it, there were little pieces of chicken in it. This has happened to me in other places and I understand that not many people ask to leave the meat out. When I called the manager, he refused to cancel the order (the other places have offered to do that) and would only allow me to pick up another one. On top of that he definitely was talking down to me like I was lying or something. I did not have the time to go back and he said he will drop in a gift card instead and took down my address. Two weeks later, I am still waiting for my gift card and paid $15 for food I could not eat. Their ethics sucks and I will never go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-troy?start=20,2.44,3.36,3.36,,2.9920000000000004

Our friends were already there and had just gotten a table so we walked in and just joined them.  After we ordered drinks (Diet Coke with Lemon for me and my wife wanted to try Cucumber Revival) we studied the menus and I chose a Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza from the Veterans Day Menu and my wife picked a Half Order Roasted Vegetables Salad. Is was quite busy because it was Saturday night as well as Veterans Day but service was quick and and our orders came out very promptly.  Drinks were kept full although we did have to ask for refills a couple times.  The Pizza was very good and the crust had good chew as well as decent crunch and I knew I had made a good choice.  My wife's Grilled Vegetable Salad was grilled and then chilled vegetables served on top of chopped lettuce and my wife loved it!

82,Elina D.,"Walled Lake, United States",39,182,379.0,1.0,2017-11-12,"CPK has gone down hill, especially this location! We were seated at a table that wasn't cleaned off. So we sat at the booth waiting for it to be cleaned. The waitress came to greet us and we asked if the table could be wiped off, she quickly apologized. While waiting for our table to get cleaned, we opened up our napkin rolls and every piece of silverware was dirty. We asked for new sets, and she said really, let me look at these. She literally started inspecting the silverware, and didn't take our word for it. What's the point of arguing?  The waitress came back (five minutes later) and said ok here you go. In the meantime, our table was not wiped off, which she quickly did after we reminded her. The manager stopped by our table and apologized for the way things started off. He offered us a complimentary app, which was a very nice gesture. He said for us to check back in with him after our meal, to make sure everything else turned out well.  We ordered the complimentary trio appetizer of spring rolls, and a few of the rolls were burned (see photo). We didn't bother complaining and just dealt with it.  We ordered the Thai crunch salad and the Jamaican jerk pizza. The salad was swimming in dressing and pizza didn't come out as requested.  We ordered the bacon very well done, and the majority of the bacon on the pizza was very undercooked.  We asked for a manager and shared our complaints with him. He apologized, but he was pretty dismissive and ran off quickly. I understand, it's the holidays and the mall is busy, but at least act like you give a damn. I was just surprised that a manager would be wearing a football jersey and a baseball hat during hours of business.
