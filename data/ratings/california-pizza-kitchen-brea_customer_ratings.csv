We called and notified them that we were here. The gentlemen stated it would only take a few more minutes. As we waited in the car...25-30 minutes passed..We decided to go inside and check where our food was. They explained that the last dish (pasta) was still not ready. We werent in a crazy hurry so we didn't complain or anything. It took maybe another 15 minutes and finally our food came out. The manager came out and apologized to us and gave us the pasta for free~! =) The staff was very professional and handled the situation very well. The food was great! And they gave us free refills while we were waiting.  We ordered: white pizza, alfredo fettucini w/ shrimp & chicken, and korean bbq tacos. All were very delicious!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=260,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.3440000000000003,3.0400000000000005

I don't eat pizza n pasta too often, but I like CPK a lot.  They have many kinds of salads, light but very flavored. They always add new items, love the small dishes they have now, as well as thin crust pizza. It is inexpensive but the portions are not big, for a eater like me I need to order quite a few dishes. They have full bar. The bill is between $50-80 including alcohol beverages, service is always good.

340,Rick L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4,28,1.0,5.0,2012-02-13,OK so the food was not that amazing BUT... Service was outstanding. I say that AFTER my wife could not get her first request. Basically went there on a busy Sunday afternoon and sat on the patio. Only one other couple was on the patio and the inside was hopping. I usually do not like sitting outside because I always worry about getting served. Seems many places forget you. We sat down and with in moments the young man Chris came over and asked for our drink orders. He was back in 2 shakes with our drinks.  Few minutes later we placed our order. My wife ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Jambalaya. We also ordered the Devil Shrimp. The shrimp was deep fried and covered in some kind of delicious cream sauce. We both loved it. My Jambalaya was typical stuff not fantastic but definitely very good. The Salmon however was NOT available!! Oh My. How did they handle you ask?? Well prior to coming out our server checked with his boss and was told to basically give my wife whatever dish she wanted at no charge!!! What the ..... She ordered the Kung Pao Pasta which was nothing special but definitely tasty. We also had the Apple Desert with Ice Cream. The Crisp. It was good. Not enough Caramel.  Great Service guys. I cannot count the times this has been handled terribly. Many places I have been end up telling you about the missing dish once they bring everyone else's food. Handled in spectacular fashion.

279,John S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",301,111,31.0,3.0,2012-04-05,"GREAT PIZZA....BUT SMALL PORTIONS & LARGE TABS I should start by saying this place does live up to it's reputation, it has some amazing pizza...and it has small portions at a ridiculous price.  Do I recommend it? Yes, definitely worth a try and I promise you will love it, but you might not go every day given the portions and their prices.  So they offer a large variety of pizzas (and other stuff too but who goes to CPK for anything but pizza let's be real). They have pizzas with every topping you could think of and some you didn't think of. They offer toppings from the obvious choices like pepperoni, vegetables, sausage, etc. to more surprising toppings like avocado, lettuce, scallions, tortilla strips, corn and even some crazy sauces like ranch dressing, black bean salsa, lime cream sauce, and mayonnaise. They have some very unique creations like the Chipotle Chicken with enchilada cheese and salsa, the thai chicken which has tortilla strips, the pear and gorgonzola, or the works with spring salad. And of course the list goes on and on, but the main point is that the only original thing here might be to order a simple pepperoni pizza, if they let you that is. So the first time I went here I got the Hawaiian bbq chicken pizza which was amazing and a half! It comes with bbq chicken, fresh pineapples, green onions, and red onions on normal crust. The pizza was amazing, the only downside was that it was a personal pizza that did not fill me up and that alone was over $10...so yeah kinda disappointed to some degree.  Overall some amazing pizza I definitely recommend anyone who has never tried it to go here at least once, just go in knowing you are going to pay high prices with smaller portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=260,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.2120000000000006,3.1200000000000006

278,Jennifer P.,"Fullerton, CA",114,3,19.0,4.0,2012-04-14,"Went on a busy Friday evening with my family. The wait was about 45min long but it's worth the wait. Service here was good, the waiter came about 2min after we sat down to get drink orders. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order our meal. I forgot our waiter's name but it felt really nice when he got me a 2nd glass of my Italian soda without even asking when I was almost finishing my first glass. For food, we started with Dynamite Shrimp, then ordered California Club pizza and Kung Pao Spaghetti. The Dynamite Shrimp is lightly fried and had a nice chili sauce that was just slightly spiced. I've had California Club before and it still feels interesting to have lettuce and avocado on a pizza. The Kung Pao Spaghetti was my first time trying and it really impressed me. I usually don't eat spicy food, so one was really really spicy to me, but I still couldn't stop eating it even as my mouth and lips were already feeling the burn.  My dad scoffed at my orders at first (""Why are you ordering Asian dishes when you can eat them at a Chinese restaurant.""), but I like the Californian spin on the foods that we're used to that they do here at CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=260,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.3440000000000003,3.2000000000000006
268,Carren Marie S.,"Anaheim, CA",318,189,131.0,3.0,2012-04-16,"If only it was bigger. Ambience: Big well known food chain, it's always busy, a bit loud, and lots of families - and I mean A LOT of familes. This particular CPK is in a mall for crying out loud. I've been here a few times and upon walking into the restaurant I can always hear a baby crying somewhere. Granted, I get it, they can't help it. But still...Feels a little bit like a Chuck E Cheese, not exactly a date location. At least not this specific one. And what is UP with the layout of this restaurant, it's so awkward - long and narrow. Narrow spaces and babies don't mix well. Yummy: Bravo on their new Small Bites menu. More so, new small portion dishes adds more variety to your meal instead of the standard ""pizza"". Which by the way, is scrumptious as well. Vegetarian options are a plus. Service, could be much better... just because its a major chain that people will go to, doesn't mean they should lack at service. It seems like a mission to find your waiter in every visit.  Rating: Wouldn't be so high if it wasn't for the food. Gosh.. the food. Always a pleasant taste.  Unfortunate: If you're hungry and ONLY hungry.

It took about 5-6 minutes from parking and calling, but that's way cheaper than the $10 delivery fee.  Split a ginger chicken dumpling, kids bbq pizza and chicken caesar focaccia sandwich with a friend.  My only disappointment was that the kids meal comes with a drink, we picked water, and we never got it with our order. Sure, it's only water... but it's supposed to come with the meal.  The ginger chicken dumplings were yummy, a little spicier than I could handle but I really have ZERO tolerance so that's no surprise.  The bbq pizza was fantastic, as always... I really like their frozen version at grocery stores, too. The focaccia bread on the chicken caesar sandwich is delicious but they really doused the dressing on to the point where it became soggy and was dripping.

They also have free bread while you wait for your order!  Their pizzas are great, thin crust and quite filling for a person, that I usually have to take home. Their salads are great too. The right ratio of dressing to the salad. My only complaint is that the roasted garlic chicken pizza that I have come to love and frequently come to order does not exist! Even when it was on the menu, they ran out of the sauce! Completely unacceptable,  especially when there were three days left for it to be on the menu. That pizza will forever be missed.

After that, the interview went well & she told me I would hear back from them no matter what their response was by the weekend. I never got a call, so I called them twice. The first time I called, I was told that the manager was, once again, on a conference call and the second time, they said someone would call me back, but never did. It's been 3 weeks with no response & obviously I gave up on getting one a while ago. I think there is a huge lack of professionalism on that aspect.

I find that joining their email list and getting occasional coupon offers that you can stack with gift card use is a more economical way to enjoy CPK.  Costco sells $100 worth of gift cards for $80.  The CPK web site had a Black Friday deal in 2012 for $40 free gift cards with purchase of $100 gift card also.  I justified such a large purchase back then thinking I would give four $25 cards as gifts, but then decided to keep them because I think I enjoy pizza a lot more than the average person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=240,3.68,3.5,3.5,2.768,3.5720000000000005

The bbq chicken pizza was delicious, as usual. Who knew bbq sauce would taste so good on a pizza? The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  As for the california club, it's a very unique presentation. It literally looks like  caesar salad on top of pizza dough, with slices of avocado going around the pizza.

This place gets packed but to my wonderful surprise we were seated within 15 mins when we were told 25! That was my first surprise. The second, and way better, was the change in the comp bread. They switched from kinda dry French and butter to a fresh delightfully crispy on the outside soft and yummy goodness on the in. Also instead of butter they now give olive oil with herbs. Funny how a little change like that can really revitalize the meal! We ordered two house salads and shared the spinach artichoke thin crust pizza. The salad was plain but good. If you don't like your salad drowned with dressing than this is the salsas for you. Mixed greens, tomato, croutons and light ranch.

The service was fast, we got seated immediately, and service was friendly. My only complaint is the price and the dessert; just for what it was, definitely wasn't worth the price, but whatever. Also, the dessert menu was non existent... They had 4 things to choose from and for me, they were all things you'd leave on a platter at parties because nobody wants them. It was pudding and 3 other things, and also, I don't want to pay $10 for pudding that I can make at home for $1.25.

302,Dennis L.,"Placentia, CA",6,36,,3.0,2014-07-24,"CPK used to be one of our favorite chain restaurants.  We like its innovating and constantly updating menu items.  The food items deserve 4- 4.5 stars.  But my affinity toward CPK has been tempered by inconsistent service and long wait time for food.  For this particular location, there was one occasion where the hostess was downright rude toward an elderly family member - to be fair, that was probably an isolated incident.  Otherwise, I wouldn't say the service is bad, but it certainly leaves more to be desired.  One quite a few occasions, it took a long time for the server to come over to the table after we were already seated, and then the server basically did not come back for water or follow-up throughout the meal despite empty or half empty glasses.  Another issue is the wait time for food (not for table) - while we know this is not McDonalds, the average wait time for food has been consistently (and at times unbearably) long compared to other similar restaurants. We usually ask for the complimentary bread when we order the food, and one time we were told that bread was not available because the bread slicing machine was broken... seriously? Maybe another isolated incident.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the service standard from an institutional standpoint, but too many isolated incidents of bad /mediocre service certainly can have the potential of leaving a bad taste in a diner's mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=280,2.84,3.16,3.16,3.1160000000000005,3.0320000000000005

We came to Brea mall on Saturday to get some late mother's day shopping in. We were hungry and couldn't decide what to eat on, but we happened to park at the entrance where CPK is located on.  Against my past experiences, I gave it another chance. So I'll start with the food.  I got a pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty decent, but to be fair it's kinda hard to screw up a pepperoni pizza.  Girlfriend got a green pasta thing, forgot what it was called.  It was pretty good, but be warned I've been told it makes your poop green.  So you just kinda gotta weigh that out if it's worth it. Now, this dining experience adding into my previous CPK experiences pretty much solidifies that I will never eat at CPK again. We got seated like right in front of a huge elementary school party.  At one point, all we could hear is 25 kids yelling ""CHEEESE CHEEESE"" for 5 minutes straight to take a picture.  There were like 15 kids in front of our table playing with balloons like volleyballs.  At one point, a few of them decided they wanted to play with us (we didn't want to play) and we got balloons thrown at us repeatedly. Not only was this a huge annoyance, but this is also dangerous - common sense where there is hot food being moved around is not a good place for kids to be running around.   Disappointed the parents didn't keep the children under controlled but even more disappointed because CPK should have said something.  I saw one kid fall.  I saw one girl almost hit her head on the corner of a table.

When I told her my party was here she basically shrugged her shoulders and said ""I can't keep another party waiting"". Well, what was I doing, I believe I was waiting too?   I asked to speak to the manager but apparently there wasn't one available, only a kitchen manager, Christian, who at least was respectful and was listening to our complaint.  As my friend and I were expressing our concern to him, SARA was shaking her head and rolling her eyes.  She was even laughing for a moment after whispering to another employee.  My friend told SARA that this was not a laughing matter.  SARA's response was ""How do you know we're even laughing at you?""      To the CPK manager in Brea....you need to rethink who you put at the front hostess area.  These people are the first employees that your customers are in contact with.  SARA not only needs an adjustment in her attitude but she also needs to know how to approach customers in situations like these.  If she would have come to me and tell me, ""I'm sorry but if your party doesn't get here in 5 minutes I will have to give your table away"".  That I could understand.  But to just give our table away after I've been waiting and then speaks to us in a disrespectful tone if front of the children?   SARA does not have the customer service skills or did not receive the correct training in handling a large party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=220,3.24,3.16,3.16,2.8200000000000003,3.1920000000000006

There were also a few interesting dishes that we had a lot of trouble choosing between since they all sounded so good. However I was really, really disappointed with the pizza when it came out. I got the ""original hand tossed"" variety, called ""The works"". What came out was an extremely flat pizza that looked like something I might buy frozen at a store and make at home. It was the size of most personal pizzas. The variety of ingredients on it made it pretty tasty, but I honestly cannot justify paying almost $16 for the pizza I got.  My boyfriends pizza was the ""thin crust"" type and literally was SO thin that it looked like they cooked it on a tortilla. His was also almost $16.

(Unfortunately, that's not an exaggeration) and dropped the check immediately after, ignoring any drink refills while we were still eating.  Second visit: At first we thought the server may just be a nervous new server. (I know how it is) But after a while we just realized it was something else. He made us feel extremely uncomfortable the entire visit.  Third visit: We were hesitant to come, but thought we'd give it one more shot since we were craving their Chopped Salad.

47,La Tanya J.,"Fullerton, CA",92,1,,1.0,2016-10-06,"On Sept 18th we went the Brea Mall CPK with our Girl Scout troop #3596 went to have a tour and eat at your restaurant and we very disappointed. The girls didn't get learn anything about owning a business, or how long you been established, how many pizza you make in a day. They gave us dough and left us alone at the table for over 20mins. We have been on other tours from other restaurants and they were AMAZING! This was an awful experience for the girls. We never saw the manager or owner. We had to pay $10 per girl. The Girl Scouts is a nonprofit organization.... I was disgusted by the lack of cleanliness of the kitchen. There was raw chicken and Shrimp left out defrosting in a tub on the floor. We had to walk on the wet slippery floor with dirty dishes everywhere. I mean Really!!! They didn't even seem like they to care that 15 little girls and there moms were coming to visit their restaurant that day. It looked like nobody even cleaned up from the night before, that's a health violation for sure. I will not go back to that restaurant or any other CPK ever again because of the uncleanliness of your establishment. I felt like we should have got a better tour or even apology from the manager. I've called the manager a few times and he doesn't even seem to care. I'm sorry I wish I had better things to say about my experience at CPK. I've called corporate a few times and left messages, I've Instagram, twitter, and facebook and I've got no reply back from anyone.

20,MAGGIE K.,"Anaheim, CA",37,20,15.0,1.0,2016-10-20,"We usually love CPK, so this is difficult to write this 1-star review, but write it I must. The main problem we had at this Brea location was the poor service (never actually received our meal, so I can't comment much on the food). We should've learned our lesson from a previous visit, in which the manager profusely apologized for poor service and gave us coupons for free entrees on a future visit. Since there were many months in between these two visits, we still had hopes for a decent experience, but we will not EVER be back to this location.  We were there for lunch on a Wednesday, arriving around 12:40 pm. We were seated promptly in the remodeled SUPER-NOISY barn of a dining room. That right there cast a pall on the visit, as my husband and I had to shout to be heard over the din. I realize hard surfaces are easy to clean, but they don't make for a good conversational atmosphere. Obviously a big reason for the remodel was so they could cram more seating in there. Looks like the service hasn't caught up with the bigger capacity.  It took at least 15 minutes for anyone to stop by our table and acknowledge us, not even a glass of water. That should've tipped us off. Finally a waitress apologized and took our drink and food order. Husband's drink came out, but not my San Pellegrino. We both ordered soup and salads. 5-10  minutes later my soup arrives, but not hubby's soup or my drink yet (WTH?). I'm feeling rude as I apologetically begin eating, as the soup is already not as hot as it should be. My drink arrived about 5 minutes after my soup. We waited another 10-15 minutes or so, with no additional food in sight, no one checking in, and finally got disgusted and left (we left $20 on the table, which was $20 more than the experience was worth). UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF SERVICE!!! 40 minutes without food is just too long. SOME SERIOUS SERVICE and MANAGEMENT ISSUES at Brea CPK. Guess I'll learn to make that salad at home.

Last night, my husband and I ate dinner here and ordered the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower. When it arrived, it's obviously different from what we used to order in other CPK locations, in terms of the serving size, it's as if they chopped a 2 big cauliflower and just spread it out. Asked our server and she was clueless about the real serving size. A manager came over and talked to us, I even showed him the picture that I took and posted on my Facebook account, on how different it was in terms of the serving size. I even compared it to the picture that they have displayed on their table (they're promoting it because it's new). He said that he'll talk to their chef, BUT didn't do anything about our order. We were truly disappointed, left without any explanation why is their Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower different from the rest of other CPK branches.

Being served by Scott for the second time is what prompted me to type them this updated review. Quality: 5/5 The quality of the food is always consistently amazing! We got the Wedge Salad with Ranch dressing vs blue cheese and BBQ Chicken Pizza with bacon and garlic, well done with extra cilantros and red onions.  Both came out perfectly and equally outstanding.  5 stars all the way! Quantity: 5/5 The portions were super generous, we barely finished them, so definitely enough for two. Especially when it comes with free courtesy breads.  We prefer eating the bread with butter vs the free oil dipping sauce.  Customer Service: 5/5 As previously mentioned above, we were serviced by Scott twice and today was no exception. Scott was on point, I was blown away by how many tables he covered and was still amazing.  I hope I get him every time, talking about amazing service!  Cleanliness: 5/5 Of course 5 stars, this place is nothing other than immaculate. So clean you can eat off the table if you drop something.  Price: 5/5 If you get great service and and great food, which we did, nothing is too expensive at that point.

What I did not expect was to spend 2 hour at the restaurant for this meal. No, it's not because we were having so much fun. It was because our server Israel was the worst. We sat at the tail end of the lunch rush on a Sunday. At that point, the restaurant was only 3/4 full. 40 minutes to order and get drinks. Good luck with refills. I would have had better luck walking to the food court and buying drinks for the table. 40 minutes to get our food, then the waiter wants to argue about what we ordered. We ALWAYS get exactly the same thing (come on, you know how it is with kids) so don't argue that we ordered something different. Even if we did, where is your customer service?? Then Israel disappeared never to be heard from again. Just kidding. He did not come back to check on the table or offer drink refills (The kids were thirsty). Another 40ish minutes to get the check. Really? Do you know how difficult it is to keep a 7yo and two 5 yos content for that length of time in a restaurant?? We were so frustrated, we didn't even order a dessert for the birthday kids. We just wanted out of there. Waiting, waiting, waiting, We put the credit card away and paid cash. We couldn't wait any longer. We had to walk up to the bar to get take-out containers for our food.  As we were getting up from the table to leave, suddenly Israel appeared. I'm sure he wanted to make sure we paid. I let him know we were disappointed with the service. It was the worst service we have had at this type of restaurant. He just started blankly. No apology. Nothing. Not seeing a manager around, I went and complained to the hostesses. They apologized and said they would inform the manager. I heard Israel tell a different table he was ""slammed."" Umm, sure. The restaurant was not even half full at that point. Since I did not get to speak to a manager, I contacted corporate. I received an email stating someone would get back to me within the next few days. Good thing I didn't hold my breath. It's been 4 weeks now. I waited to write this review, giving them the benefit of the doubt that it would be resolved. Obviously CPK does not care about customer service. Thanks, but no thanks.

280,Derek D.,"La Habra, CA",88,110,16.0,2.0,2017-09-16,This place has been going downhill over the last couple years. I generally do not come here and only will come because my wife has a coupon or my mother and her limited food choices wants to come here. The Thai Chicken pizza used to be my go-to but the last few times I have been here its been inconsistent and not as flavorful as it used to be. The service is hit and miss but I would more attribute it to them packing the sections as densely as they can without hiring more service staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=20,3.64,2.86,3.132,,3.172

I haven't been to this location in years, I stopped going because of the bad service LOL, recently my sister reintroduced us back to CPK (the Irvine location) and we were hooked! It started with the small bites and bread and then it turned into a love fest of all their yummy food!! My sister has their app on her phone and it makes it so easy to place your order and customize from beginning to end! If your like me and prefer extra sauce and cheese this makes it easy to get what you really want and leave off what you don't want LOL! We already know the pizza is solid but their other entrees are delicious! I enjoyed the spaghetti bologense along with my fried mac and cheese bites! My sister came over last week and we figuring out what we wanted for dinner since we were in the area and I'm really glad we decided to give this location another chance! Even though we a did a to-go order the wonderful Annie Jo made us feel like VIPs! She was running the pick up order station and was on point! When we asked for extra bread and ranch she delivered! Nor did she have an attitude unlike most people when you ask for extras or charge you for them! Every step of the way she had a great attitude! At the last minute I decided to get one of their drinks to go and she didn't skip a beat, gave us a smile and it was ready in two seconds! She made sure we had all of our food and extras, she gave us so many olive oil, utensils and napkins! I only hope the rest of the staff takes a lesson on how to give green customer service like Annie Jo does! She is so friendly and inviting, making you feel valued as a customer! We were so enthralled with her great customer service we even called later that same night even though they had closed the manager answered the phone and was happy to hear about our great service! I hope Annie Jo gets the props and recognition she deserves! ^___^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea,3.52,2.82,3.124,,3.1

335,Sarah C.,"Brea, CA",166,4,,5.0,2017-10-11,"I placed an order with CPK a couple of days ago that arrived not only incorrect, but in complete disarray.  My pizza was burnt to a crisp and my salad sat for a half hour on top of an order of hot pasta rendering it warm and slimy.  As most of my food was inedible I called CPK and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to Fernando and explained that I had waited over an hour for my food, spent nearly 10 minutes on hold waiting to speak to him, and since I have a broken left leg and a broken right foot, it's not like I could run up to the nearest drive thru to get food.  This is when I received bar none THE highest level of customer service I have ever experienced.  Instead of giving me the number for Grub Hub to request a refund for my $50+ botched order, he said he would take care of that for me and asked if I would like the food re-made.  As it was 9:30 pm at this point and I was extremely hungry but immobile, I said that I would appreciate that very much.  He said that he was getting off work shortly, and instead of waiting for a Grub Hub driver to replace my order, he said he would deliver it to my apartment on his way home to ensure it was hot and fresh.  Not 25 minutes after I hung up the phone, there was Fernando at my door with my entire order of food remade, a copy of the email from Grub Hub confirming my refund, as well as $30 worth of vouchers to use on my next visit to CPK.  I was blown away and beyond grateful that the manager of a restaurant would take the time and effort he did to ""make it right.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea?start=40,3.52,2.8,3.108,,3.088

Checked in at hostess desk and got a pager, hostess was really friendly and said 10 mins. We waited for awhile then noticed seats at the bar wide open. We were so hungry we sat down and gave the pager back to hostess. Took about 5 mins for bartender to acknowledge us and she said to give her a minute. She then took about 5 minutes to make 1 drink then took that persons order and walked away. We sat there about 15 minutes with not even a glass of water, bar flies buzzing around in our faces. We were wishing we had just waited for a table instead.

2,Ashlyn O.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",68,63,5.0,1.0,2017-11-16,"I've been to several CPKs and this one was by far the worst. The food was the same as it is at any location, but the ambiance and service was awful. My husband and I got to the location after my friends had been seated. There were 4 of us all together and we only got 2 menus at the table despite them being aware that we would be joining a couple minutes after they were seated. When we asked for more menus they looked panicked and must have forgotten or not had any more because they didn't bring menus or mention it when they came back to take our orders. We put in our orders and the food came eventually, but they forgot my husband's order so that took another 15 minutes and I let him eat some of my food while he waited. When his food finally came out it was great. I was downing water so I had to run to the restroom a couple times and each time I went in the bathroom was a mess and there was a group of drunk girls in front of the mirror. The first time it was funny watching them stumble around like idiots, but after the 3rd time I got run into while standing at the sink washing my hands. At that point the drunk girls were wasted and started getting aggressive with myself and the other patrons. It was clear this restaurant overserved that group several drinks too many. When I came back and we got our check, I thought we made it clear earlier that the check was being split for the two couples so we could get our own CPK card points, but apparently it wasn't so I asked for it when the bill came as one. They said they couldn't split it on the paper check but could take both cards and do it manually in the system, so we handed over our cards. When the bill came back I was given the wrong credit card so they grabbed it from me and after 10 minutes gave me my card back. I had a feeling they messed something up so I checked my bank account and it turns out they charged me $100 for someone else's meal in addition to the $30 meal we ate. I saw the reversal pending on my account, but it was a weekend so I knew it was going to take a couple of days to get that money back whether I complained or not so I just didn't leave a tip (which I never do) and got out of there as quickly as I could. The money is back now, but the memory of that experience has destroyed my view of CPK. I have a feeling the attitude and lack of service might just be this mall. It was packed and parking was a nightmare. It felt like black Friday or Christmas Eve with how pushy and rude people were acting. Whatever it was, I don't plan on going back to that CPK or mall again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brea,3.04,2.73,3.08,,2.854

I cannot dine in at a CPK without ordering their spinach artichoke dip ($11.69). Another item I always have to order is their signature BBQ chicken pizza ($15.49). We also ordered their Garlic cream with Chicken pasta ($16.79) and it was so creamy and delicious! As soon as my boyfriend and I sat down, it got really busy so our server wasn't able to come to our table as often as we'd like. Ip did apologize and we were totally fine with it. We still got our fresh bread from Jeff (whom I believe is the manager)! He was able to help Ip out by refilling our waters and getting us cheese and pepper flakes! We had a wonderful lunch dining at CPK and I appreciate how consistent every CPK is with their ingredients.
