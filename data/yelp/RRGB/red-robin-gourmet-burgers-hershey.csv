Justin W.,"York, PA",3,243,1107,4.0,1/3/2018,A great Red Robin. The service was prompt and the waitress was helpful and didn't charge for the games I played (word of caution games are not free and they don't tell you this)The turkey burger was decent but I've had better. The main attraction here is the fries. Never skip out on the fries; they are top 5 I've eaten. I even got more (fries are truly bottomless),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Kevin J.,"Belleville, NJ",14,27,65,1.0,11/10/2017,"One star is being extremely nice. Would NOT recommend coming here!! Place smells like dirty feet and the floor of the place is extremely dirty. We had to set our own table, and then we were told they ran out of plates for the fries. The waitress was not pleasant and extremely rushing when ordering our meal!! Never had to write a  bad review but this is the first!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Paul L.,"Lancaster, PA",2,41,15,2.0,9/15/2017,"I stopped here for lunch and sat at the bar because I was by myself. I ordered a gourmet burger and sweet potato fries. The initial service wasn't bad, but after my food came, Including cold fries no one ever checked back to see how things were. I finally flagged someone down, and they got me hot fries,  the burger was fine, However for the price of their food, the service was lacking and the cold fries inexcusable. Not a good value- overpriced for food, service and atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Tina P.,"Barberton, OH",80,85,304,3.0,11/20/2016,"Typical Red Robin. The interior was interesting with fun and odd items on display. The wait was short, maybe 10 minutes. On a Saturday night that is not bad. The ambiance is fun and vibrant. Unfortunately, there is not much in the way of sound reduction. It was very loud and hard to hear and concentrate on conversation. The menu was large and varied and typical of Red Robin. Menu items included: fried pickles, chips and salsa, salads, burgers, chicken, sandwiches, desserts and a full bar with unlimited alcoholic beverages. Our waitress, Maggie, was great! She recognized my sweatshirt, Stark State, as that it is in the Akron Ohio area. As she was originally from our neck of the woods between Stow, Cuyahoga Falls and Akron Ohio. Felt great to be away from home and be taken care of by a fellow Ohioan.  Our burgers were well cooked, wall proportioned and really yummy. The French fries were perfect and the proportion was well sized. Bottomless refills on soda and iced tea was great too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Robert P.,"West Covina, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/1/2017,"Never again!  We had a wonderful waitress who patiently described the entrées to us.  We ordered two burgers ""medium rare."" When they arrived, both were cooked ""well done."" The bun was right out of the package, not warmed, not toasted...room temperature. We asked kindly, ""could you please warm, or toast the bun?"" The restaurant was not busy, so that was not the issue.  One additional bonus...I had line of sight to the kitchen. Two young men were snapping each other with damp towels...one may have been the cook??? (Not chef...) Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Lake C.,"Marquette, MI",0,73,13,2.0,7/8/2017,"Stopped here about mid-afternoon on a Thursday in July after visiting Hershey Chocolate World with my family group of 3 adults and 3 kids.  We waited an unusually long time.  Though they were busy, there seemed to be ample staff and the bussing of the table was the issue.   The service was so-so, and the server was not attentive.  Had to ask for silverware. The food was ok--not great.  My fries were cold. I thought the price was high for what I ordered.  My burger, which was an average to small sized burger was $13.99 and they charged me more for upgrading to sweet potato fries which were kind of a skimpy portion.  This is supposed to be a 'burger' joint!  I have been to other places with much better burgers and sides for a lot less money.  The kids meals were not very good as rated by them.  They have a vote too! I would rate the food at 1.5 and the service at 2 and the price point at 1. I have never been to Red Robin before and wanted to try it.  So, I feel this is a question an owner or manager of a restaurant would ask:  Would you come back again based on your experience?  Based on this experience, no.   To me that would seem to be a big deal to a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Stephen S.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2017,They are right beside a very busy entertainment venue...   you would think they would know how to handle crowds. We called ahead to make a reservation and expected a short additional wait.  They would not tell us how much longer our wait would be. We were told we were next on the list but they called multiple other parties.  So after waiting 45 additional minutes we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Katie G.,"Lynbrook, NY",23,22,,5.0,7/6/2017,"Great location right near the park. Cheaper than eating inside, especially with bottomless fries! There is also a tanger outlets right next to it for shopping. Burgers are good quality and steak fries are delicious, which is great that they are also endless!

Guppie F.,"Outer Banks, NC",0,3,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Where do I start with this review? This is probably  one of the worst meals I have ever eaten and one star is pretty generous. To begin, we were served our food with dirty plates, no napkins nor any cutlery. Our waitress was probably one of the worst-very indifferent and inattentive. No thank you, never came to check to see if our food was ok and took over 1 hour to serve our food. When our food finally did arrive, the entire order was wrong. My friend and I had ordered the same burger. My burger had the first half of what was suppose to be on it and my friends had the other half. When I sent my burger back for a new one, they simply scraped off what wasn't supposed to be on it and gave it back. For these reason I will never be coming back to a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Jackie B.,"Quarryville, PA",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,"I wish I could give this experience less than a 1* but that is my only option. We go to the Red Robin in Lancaster, PA every so often and have never had an issue. We decided to stop by the one in Hershey before a Hershey Bears game. Knowing that it was a home game night, we knew that we may have been in for a wait but thought ourselves lucky when we were seated 12 mins into what they said would be a 30 min wait. Little did we know that was going to be the shortest wait we would have....after being seated it took 15 mins before anyone came over to take our drink order, in this time another table over in another section was seated shortly after us and had already received their drinks. Our section was starting to empty out but it took yet another 15 mins or so before our drinks showed up. My water with a lemon wedge showed up with something gross on it (it looked like uncooked hamburger). My husband's food did not arrive as ordered, even after the waitress had repeated the order back to him. Both of us substituted onion rings for fries and each got 4 of the smallest onion rings (you can get bottomless fries with your burger but if you substitute onion rings for $1.59 upcharge you get 4 small little things....). I was less than impressed with this visit. If asked if I would ever go back-that would be a big NO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Sabrina D.,"Rome, NY",77,2,,1.0,9/1/2017,Being in the restaurant business I wasn't too impressed . I knew I was walking into a burger joint but I was at least expecting my food fresh and good ... in this case this place didn't have ...: they pre cook their fries which I knew for a fact they sat and became soggy . And the burger which I couldn't imagine how someone can screw up one but they precook there meat and then throw it all together ... not too impressed . First and last time . I'm pretty open minded and never complain but this just was upsetting because I know they have to be aware of what they're giving out and seem to be ok with it.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Kenny H.,"Port Republic, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/25/2017,Came here after a conference late night. Usually pretty good food but not this time. Took quite a while to get a refill on a drink. I got the sautéed shroom as my meal with black beens on the side. What a joke to see this small overpriced burger that they gave me. For starters the beans that I ordered were beans straight from a can that the chef cooked to long and dried them out. The beans were also not seasoned at all so it was a dry and boring side. The burger was overpriced for what it was. I also wonder how long it sat in the kitchen since the bun was soggy aswell. The beef was okay but the mushrooms that were supposed to be sautéed in garlic were bland. Like they cut up a mushroom and fried it with no seasoning and put it on the burger. The burger was very small and the buns were not toasted either. Like it came out of the container and heated it slightly. What a waste of money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Matt Z.,"Hummelstown, PA",9,2,,2.0,11/7/2017,"Food wasn't good. Buns were dry and fell apart while eating. Fries were also dry. Service was ok. Waitress was pleasant.

Rusty R.,"Jersey City, NJ",346,276,7,2.0,5/9/2016,"Huge selection of burgers, but nothing stood out about my meal.  Burger was flavorful but unmemorable, and fell apart too easily. Fries were not good. Disappointed that menu didn't include nutrition info, but perhaps that's a state-by-state requirement (I'm not from PA). Enjoyed the mini tablets on each table to pay when ready, but I noticed a little fine print that indicated their tip calculator uses price AFTER tax.  That's nonsense - tip is calculated PRE-TAX and anyone who doesn't read that fine print is getting one-overed.  Granted the price of my meal barely affected the tip math, but for a larger group that could make a big difference.  This may be a corporate indiscretion rather than this location, I have no idea because I've never been to a Red Robin before (and not itching to go again).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey
Sara S.,"Camp Hill, PA",0,10,,5.0,3/14/2017,We stopped here before a hershey bears game and it was definitely crowded. We were worried we weren't going to make it to see the puck drop so we told our waitress. She did a great job at moving things along! The tablets on the table make it easy to order drinks and pay without waiting on anything. Don't play any games on the tablets though or it'll charge you and extra couple bucks! Food is pretty standard here. It's good and I can't complain! Perfect place to stop before catching an event in Hershey.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey

Philip S.,"Ocean City, NJ",0,10,,1.0,8/21/2017,"Really a Shame. Our family typically visits the Hershey area several times a year and always stops at this Red Robin for dinner. Today was the worst experience ever. Amateur hour at best. The minute we walked in the hostess was obnoxiously rude (they were slow not busy and hustling). The waiter was a joke and thought his subtle sarcasm would go unnoticed. Complete lack of respect for customers. The Avo Cobb O salad was horrible!!! I get this all the time- but today they used the most rotten, dry and brown lettuce they could find. The toppings were almost nonexistent. I asked for no tomatoes and found a small stack hidden. Under some of the salad (no doubt intentional). I'll never be back- there are plants of places to eat that want to keep customers and take pride in their food. Stay away!

First thing I notice is the parking lot always looks filled. It's in the same plaza as the Tanger Outlets so I think some of the congestion is outlet overflow.

First off, we are in town to celebrate my daughter's birthday weekend so I thought of bringing out the family to Red Robin for dinner. It was an overall terrible experience. We were seated rather quickly, in the back room. It took our server about 15 minutes to acknowledge us, once she finally came to us she was quite pleasant to work with but as we placed an order she informed us they were all out of their famous spinach dip. Then serving a much larger party that arrived after us with the dip that a few minutes ago we were told they were all out of. I asked for them to hold a birthday cake in the back, throw a candle on it and sing happy birthday to my 4 year old and was told to keep the cake on our table. Even after we hauled the cake all the way from NY. I will never give my patronage to this Red Robin ever again!  After a not so pleasant visit to the restaurant, I must say I am very impressed with their service response to said matter. I truly appreciate the General Manager of the store reaching out to me via phone, showing interest in my issue, and most importantly taking ownership of resolving any future issues.

Blake Z.,"Lebanon, PA",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2015,"Cold food, slimy chicken sandwich. Had an endless wait for the endless fries. It was busy and employees were everywhere but the service was still slow. I counted 12 employees in the walkway by my table at one point. There was at least 20 people working the floor.Terrible table location near the kitchen. I wish the manager sat in my spot and evaluated what was happening on the floor. It was just that bad. The extra long wait time was blamed on the new ""system"". Why is that an excuse and why would you tell your customers that. The new system should increase efficiency and service. How long does it take to make burgers and frys?

Todd P.,"Arlington, VA",31,431,552,1.0,11/29/2014,"Ironically, this is the first Red Robin we ever went to, but as they've expanded into our home state of Virginia where we've had good service, our experiences at this Red Robin have gotten progressively worse to the point we won't return to this location. The food is basically the same, but the service has gone from good to awful over the years to the point its slow and inattentive. What's also odd is that they don't follow the same policies we are used to in Virginia. They wouldn't honor our Red Robin Royalties Rewards card and there was an up charge for getting a burger as a chicken sandwich, whereas the two are interchangeable at no charge back home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey?start=40
Cathy C.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/16/2016,"We have loved Red Robin in CA for many years, our son was even a GM. I seldom write reviews, but I have to say that the Hershey Red Robin has the worst service staff I ever experienced.  A hostess that doesn't speak to you, just shows you the table hands the menu and walks away. The waitress seemed promising until she didn't follow through on my husbands request for more soda and fries and the person who brought the food no words describe her - dropped it on the table and walked away as we were asking for mustard and more lemonade for our grand daughter.  There is no Red Robin that isn't busy on Friday nights so that is certainly no excuse.  Perhaps some smile and costumer service training is in order.  Glad my next RR experience will NOT be in Hershey",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey?start=40

There bird logo is on the floor where you enter and there is a plane hanging in the dining area. Our waitress Amy was very friendly and helpful. My friend isn't really good at eating spicy food so she asked about the buffalo wings with extra blue cheese. I had the Burnin' Love burger which was pretty good and giant. The only problem was that the bottom bun got really soggy; not only mine but everyone else that got a burger too.

For dinner, we both got burgers. My boyfriend got the peppercorn burger which he hated and they slightly messed his up. I got the Whiskey River BBQ burger, which I thought was pretty good.

The atmosphere is a bit cheezy, but gives you something to look at while you're waiting.   Overall it was pretty decent, I had the fish and chips, my friend had Baja Burger and my mom had some type of regular hamburger, all of which were absolutely amazing.  The only thing I didn't like was the side of macaroni and cheese I got, not htat it was bad, as my friend loved it, but it's very creamy and not my style that I like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey?start=40

Try the (free) campfire dipping sauce and you'll be in heaven!! The appetizers are standard but I find myself loving the pretzel bites in the cheddar beer sauce.

The buns were not toasty, the fries were under cooked. My hubby ordered a single and received a double. My son ordered meatballs that came out with no dipping sauce. The meatballs and the burger patties looked and tasted like they had been setting around for awhile. My son also had a fruit cup that came out in a plastic condiment container that was about as wide as a quarter and about an inch deep. Beyond skimpy. Our sodas were flat. And to top it off, the ziosk tablet that was on the table added a 1.99 charge to our bill for its use.

When we first walked in, the place smelled very bad, like an old dirty dish rag mixed with diapers filled with bat guano.  My friend reassured me that when the food came, it would be better. We saw the menu said 'Ask about our extensive beer selection of craft and imported beers' We asked if they had any Troegs (an excellent local brewery)... answer, No.  Never mind, on to the supposedly outstanding burgers.  The three of us ordered a gourmet (classic) cheeseburger, Burnin' Love Burger (fried jalepenos), and Royal Red Robin burger (bacon and fried egg).  And they were all STUPENDOUSLY bad. Not ok, not mediocre, not could have been better, BAD. All the beef was either lukewarm or straight cold... obviously frozen pre-formed patties... grimy, flavorless, bleh. Onion rings were the only thing that was hot.  The buns weren't toasted, the lettuce was limp, the jalepenos weren't even that spicy.  We ate about 75% of our food out of sheer hunger.       The server was friendly and attentive.... that's the only good thing I can say.  When we told the manager about our experience, he was apologetic and said we should have sent back any food that wasn't good...

My kids were able to get a veggie burger kids meal with fruit or salad. Really nice to have that. I got a garden burger. You can pick all your options including the roll and dipping sauce for the fries.  The fries were outrageous!! fresh salty, endless, if you can eat that much. Server was friendly, place needed a good vacuuming, but it was the end of the day. Giving them the benefit of the doubt. If you are a vegetarian and want a good burger, this is the place to go.

We were there this past weekend and they told us it would be a 40 min wait, but being all over 21 it could speed it up because we could sit in the bar. So we were very hungry, we had gone to herShey chocolate world then  sat in 30 mins of tail lights to see lights so we gave up we were the definition of hangry in that car. So we go to red robin they seated us in about 20 mins which was great, ( we could have done without the nasty host though giving attitude to her fellow staff. Very unprofessional)  so we sit, we tried ordering an app just to hold us over until food came out on the kiosk ita broken! Nobody has come to our table to greet us get us drinks. We had to go to the bar for soda!  We tried getting a new kiosk they gave us the same broken one, we asked for our waiter nobody came over Finally our waiter comes over we order everything.... Took probably 25mina for our food to come out some of the stuff was cold out waiter never checked on is never asked is where our app was .. That came out after we got our food! What good does that do is now?! No apologies. Nothing! My favorite was he would get close enough to see of anything was on the table and them run and go help another table! No find out where our stuff is! Talk to us! Worst service ever!!

Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",519,1118,3572,4.0,6/21/2009,"After a long road trip from New York, we were a bit hungry and not much was open besides Red Robin. Our party of 4 arrived around 10:50 pm. Although the restaurant was pretty quiet, a large party of 14 had just arrived seconds before us, so we had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated.  For the 2-3 Red Robins that I've been to, the layout of this one felt more like a TGIF or Applebee's, where tables were divided into areas providing more seclusion/privacy from the rest of the restaurant. I've been accustomed to seeing Red Robin with an open layout, family style, where you can see and wave to your fellow neighbors. To add, the kitchen was also enclosed so that I could not see the chefs preparing the meals. Service was very quick and attentive. I can't attribute if that was because they were near closing and were trying to rush us out or our waitress, Megan G, was very attentive and courteous. Throughout the course of our meal, she came over numerous times to see if we wanted extra fries (unlimited with the burgers), extra napkins, and anything else. She even brought over free refills of our orders of Raspberry Iced Tea ($2.79) and Lemonade ($2.39) before we were even halfway empty. For my entree, I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger ($9.29) which is basted with Red Robin's signature Whiskey River BBQ Sauce and topped with Cheddar cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes & mayo. It took about 8-10 minutes from when we ordered to when we were served, which was surprisingly fast. The burger was juicy and tender, and cooked to perfection (pink for me). The burger was delicious, especially with the saltiness of the crispy onion straws, to the tangy bbq sauce, and fresh lettuce and tomatoes. This wasn't one of my fave burgers at Red Robin, but I still enjoyed it. The fries were yummy as expected, crisp on the outside and very moist and potatoey on the inside, with just the right amount of salt seasoning. Two of our party members had split a burger, and the waitress was nice enough to have it cut in half and served on separate baskets, without us asking. The food here was familiar for a Red Robin, as I've experienced at all 3-4 Red Robins that I've been to. Service was definitely above and beyond, which is why I'll have to give this establishment 4 stars. Shouts to Megan G for excellent table service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey?start=80

They don't do anything under medium.  Then, The TV had closed captioning across the middle of the screen that blocked the basketball game.

We ordered the pretzel bites ($5) for a appetizer to start, the pretzels were a little cold and the cheese sauce had a strange taste to it. I did like the fact that you can order your appetizers off of the tablet at your table, but it only let you order Alcohol drinks and not Non-Alcoholic drinks which I found strange and not helpful. For dinner I got the Peppercorn Burger without tomatoes but they included them anyway. I was not happy with the taste at all and only ate about half the burger. My girlfriend got the Whiskey River BBQ Burger she thought it was Ok but not worth the $10 price. The service was very poor.

We came here for my brother's going away party before he was deployed overseas and even though they don't take table reservations, they still went out of their way to set up a room for us and let us bring in cake, balloons, all of it.   Definitely a worthwhile place with friendly staff, timely service, and good food.  Great for locals and visitors alike.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey?start=100

Although there were a number of bad reviews, we decided to take a chance since none of us wanted Wendy's and it's next to Tanger outlets. We were seated fairly quickly and the waitress came by a couple of times to see how we were doing. I got the mushroom burger and it came with endless fries. The burger and the fries were really good and it's just the right amount. We didn't need the endless fries since we were stuffed with the first. The best part of this restaurant has to be the bill. They have this machine where you can just swipe everything with a credit card and the receipt comes out. No need for the waitress at that point. Only thing about the machine is that we cannot choose what we ordered and pay for that amount, but that's not the restaurant's fault.
