Katie P.,"San Diego, CA",108,30,7,5.0,1/12/2018,"First of all I love Red Robin and even worked for them for 10 plus years... I NEVER GET TIRED OF THEIR DELICIOUS FOOD!!! One day had rough experience with a server but when I called later and talked to manager ""Kate"" (1/2018) She was the most understanding, open and wonderful example of a management professional!!! I don't care if servers screw things up, as long as Kate is there she has GOT IT HANDLED! But I will say the servers are genuinely awesome and this one experience was rare:) Awesome restaurant for adults and families!!! Fun activities for kids, amazing mixed drinks and deserts! And don't get me started on the phenomenal burgers and salads!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula

David P.,"Anaheim, CA",31,34,,1.0,11/6/2017,"This place sucks. Here's my story: Came in last night around 9pm. There was two family's waiting to be seated, and the front booth where the seater stands is totally abandoned. Finally after waiting about 5 minutes, the husband of the family To our left got kinda annoyed I think and went to hunt down the girl to sit his family Down(lol).  After that bs, we get sat down. Now I didn't get this girls name, but our waiter had the shittiest attitude I've encountered in a while. She had messed up eyebrows, dark hair in a pony tail in jeans. She literally had the worst attitude and acted like she was about to quit any second haha. At one point she collect e our menus and slammed them down in the back. As well as slammed our cash down on our table after we payed. Most likely because I didn't tip her ass. Do you expect a tip after acting like that? What world do you live in, idiot.  Do not come here there's much better Red Robin's our there besides this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula

Allison C.,"Burbank, CA",21,91,374,4.0,9/13/2017,"Haven't been to a RR since a free birthday burger in 2013. Stopped by this one on our way back to LA after 8 hours in the car, so just about anything would taste good! We were surprised it was so busy for 8:45pm on a Tuesday/school night but it is right next to a huge cinema in a mall. Service time was perfectly reasonable for how busy they were. The $6.99 double burgers (4 to choose from) and bottomless fries special is not a Gourmet extravaganza, but it is a Great deal, especially if you're on a budget. Can't even get that good a deal at Habit. I had the tavern double and hubby the smokey jack/BBQ. Not massive patties by any means but they were tasty and well constructed- I didn't even add ketchup as all the toppings and sauce were perfectly proportioned. Pickles and red onion added to mine by request at no charge and allergy questions answered straight away.  Our waitress, Megan, was lovely too!

Kiyoshi C.,"Temecula, CA",50,170,629,3.0,1/14/2017,"We rarely go to Red Robin, maybe once every year as there are usually a good number of places that serve better burgers (or wraps/salads if that's what you're looking for) at about the same price.  We came here on a Friday night, after a lot of indecisiveness on where to grab some food, made it before the dinner rush. Noticed it was happy hour, but after checking out the deals (which were severely lacking) just ordered off the regular menu. They advertise all of their local ""craft brews"" they carry now, but unless you want happy hour bud lights or coors, I wouldn't even bother going here for happy hour. Anyways, got the fiery ghost tavern double and the whiskey BBQ burger. My kids got the grilled cheese and the mac n cheese meals off the kids menu. My fiery ghost burger was ok, had a lot of heat from the sauce (which pretty much made the bun a soggy mess) but wasn't anything spectacular. The whiskey BBQ burger is what I usually get, and my girlfriend thought it was good. Kids meal were what you would expect but were priced well (I think $5 for entree, side, and a drink). Overall, 3 stars for the bottomless steak fries, which are usually the best part, and the service which was great. They are sort of working through that awkward ""self-service tablet on the table, but you can still order through the waiter"" ordeal, so that could be a little confusing, but our waiter and the hostess was nice and attentive. Red Robin, we'll probably see you in another year or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula
Juanita H.,"Wildomar, CA",19,61,95,3.0,12/13/2016,"Being there within the last hour of being closed we knew service was going to be a little off due to the closing procedures. W Once inside we ended up waiting at the front for about 10 minutes waiting to be seated. Once seated we asked for our drinks and the server forgot the water we asked. Once we received our food the server left us with no forks, napkins, ranch, or bleu cheese. I had a salad so a fork was needed. We didn't eat until 5 minutes of waiting for the server to come back. The food was delicious though. I received the bleu ribbon burger and it was good but could use some acidity, so add some pickles on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula

Their food is really good and their staff are very professional. I usually get the bruschetta chicken sandwich with extra avocado. Its really good and I highly recommend it. Last time I went, I had their southwest salad and added Salmon. It was amazing, their Salmon was cooked perfectly! Today I went and grabbed a togo order. The service was exceptional. I couldn't have asked for better staff. Katherine was really nice and helpful. She came and took my togo order, as I was waiting for my order to be ready, she brought complementary free.

If I had to work on Valentine's Day I'd probably be a complete nightmare, a moody cow. Not this girl. She went above and beyond to make sure I enjoyed my one childless evening.  My go to meal is the chicken Ensenada platter. It is soooooo good. The  salad that goes with it is amazing.  My hubby always tries one or other burger. And he is always super happy.

Connie G.,"Temecula, CA",366,568,165,1.0,2/13/2017,It's A Ok reasonably priced variety of burgers.  When we came in it was about a 25 minute wait.  I came with my husband and 2 year old.  The lady asked if we needed a high chair and I said no she can sit in a regular chair.  When they called our name about 25 minutes later they tried to sit us at the bar area with 2 seat tables.  The guy said we should of told them we had a kid.  I kindly told him I did and she asked and we told her we would need a regular seat not a high chair. The waiter then argued with me saying it was our fault and the girl did not put that in their so we were going to have to wait to be seated at another table.  If I didn't have a gift card I probably would of walked out as he was very rude and made us feel like we inconvenienced them for having a child with us.   2nd note I order a childs cheesebuger and when the order came in the fries were so hot they burnt her tongue!

The appetizers were good both the spinach and artichoke dip and chips and the cheese sticks. The veggie burger for me and the other 2 tavern burgers were small but tasty as everyone said. We wanted to try the mac and cheese but they forgot to make and bring it so we just took it of the bill since we were full anyways.

Eric J.,"Temecula, CA",43,40,4,1.0,1/5/2018,I'm still here but thought I would start this now. First I start every review at 3 stars when they are a chain and go from there. Got seated immediately but then waited about 20 mins for someone to take our order. It wasn't incredibly busy so not sure why it took so long. Eventually I pushed the call server and someone woke up and came over within a minute. Might have something to do with the flashing red light. So it went from 3 to 1 for the delay. Let me add that I watched two of the wait staff walk lazily down another aisle 5 mins before. A couple sat before us in the same section and had been sitting there before us walked out just a few moments before I hit the call server button. Funny they showed up pretty fast then. I'm not sure this is the way it's really supposed to work. I'm finishing this a few days later. I'm keeping it a 1 as this is not the way things usually are here but was such a departure from what I've come to expect that it just needs to stay that way until I go back ( and I know I will as the family loves Red Robin),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=20

She said yes.  About 10 minutes later she sat a couple with a stroller right across from us. No one could get through because of my husband's walker and the stroller.

Cyndi A.,"Temecula, CA",0,35,10,1.0,3/27/2017,"What do you think of when you hear, ""Red Robin""?  That song goes off in your head.  Maybe you even sing it.  That was me before today.  The song playing in my mind right now is, ""Are you kidding me?""  My friend and I decided to go to lunch at RR.  We were both looking forward to a great meal, something not coming from the office refrigerator.  I told my friend about the new commercial for the $6.99 Tavern Burgers.  I ordered one of the Tavern Burgers and my friend asked if they had something with bacon on it and that she needed a gluten free bun.  When they brought the burgers, I was very surprised at the size of the burgers.  We both had delicious lemon water with our burgers.  The server brought separate checks.  Mine was $7.55 and hers was darn close to $15.00.  We were very disappointed that the waiter didn't tell her the price of the burger, or at least, offer the tavern burger and just add the bacon and gluten free bun ($8.50).  He should have told her, buckle up.  Your burger's going to be $11.49 plus $1.50 for the bacon and another $1 for the gluten free bun.  She doesn't like confrontation and didn't want to say anything.  She's kind of a chalk it up to experience gal.  Hmmm, not this girl.  When the manager came to clear a few plates, she muscled the courage to speak to the manager.  Here's where it gets good.  My friend, very politely, explained to the manager that we basically had the same meals but hers was double the price.  I don't know where this manager got her training, but it went from bad to worse.  The manager explained that my burger was a ""kiddie burger, made from two FROZEN 2.5 oz patties.""  She said my friend's was a 6 oz patty.  She was totally unfazed that she had just told us their gourmet burgers were created using FROZEN patties.  My friend explained that maybe the server could have told her how much the burger cost.  She gave an example that at Mickey D's if you try to order individually, they tell you to combo it and give you the combo price.  It was just good policy and maybe she would like to mention that to the server.  She shockingly told us that the servers earn points based on the sales and so they try to sell the more expensive.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME SMALLS?  Who would admit to the customer that we just ripped you off?  I couldn't sit back any longer so out it came...I asked if she had ordered my burger for $6.99 and added the bacon how much would they have charged.  She then must have brightly realized she should stop talking. We never wanted anything free but to have such a lame, outlandish excuse is beyond reason.  Come on ""Reeeeeedddddd  Rooooobbbbbbbiiinnnn"" you are making a ton of money.  If you are going to advertise $6.99 burgers, tell people they are smaller and stop saying they are 'double burgers' when even you refer to them as Kiddie double burgers.  Secondly, $15 for a burger and water is over the top GREEDY.  Knock it off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=20

Being primarily a vegan/vegetarian, I only eat burgers 2-3 times per year. My wife signed us up for the birthday club. I have the turkey burger whenever I come to any Red Robin, and it was well prepared on this latest visit, albeit, the cooks slightly messed up our order. Parking is usually difficult, as it's located at the mall.  And since there's really nowhere to eat in Temecula (all chains/fast food), the mall is always packed.

Dave E.,"Riverside, CA",4,45,,3.0,4/4/2017,"Came in on Saturday night for my free Bday burger and the place had a 25 min wait which was ok cus there were quite a bit of people. I ordered the royal burger and I gotta say its pretty awesome. We had some issues with how long it took to get our orders and how they charge you for certain sauces which I find absolutely absurd. I got charged for literally a tablespoon of their ghost sauce. Waitress didn't inform me they charged I found out as I was looking at our receipt on the kiosk at our table. I'm just saying just let your customers know cus if I had I wouldn't of ordered it. It's the principal not the amount it cost. Our meals all tasted good surprisingly, its just the wait to get those meals is the problem.

Que E.,"Murrieta, CA",12,17,27,5.0,2/3/2016,"I haven't patronized any of the Red Robin restaurants in about 12 years, my last time was in the Midwest in Michigan and the service / meat quality of the burger was terrible.  My sister recently came from Kentucky to visit me here in Cali for several days and she was boasting about how amazing the Blue Ribbon burger at Red Robin was. I smiled at her and kind of politely blew her off and didn't go into detail about the bad experience I had 12 years ago. About two weeks after my sister left she sent me a package in the mail and it contained a gift card for Red Robin. She attached a sticky note to the card and written on it was a reminder for me to try the Blue Ribbon burger no pink. I was a bit hesitant and almost re gifted the card to someone else lol  I trusted my sisters judgement and went for it, well my sister was right and the burger was amazing, in fact it's probably one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The burger was well done and the meat quality was fresh, I could taste the blue cheese without it over powering the all around flavor of the meat and sauce.  I chose to substitute the regular fries for sweet potato fries which were really fresh and tasty, also ordered a Stella on tap to wash everything down (what a great combo). I consider myself a burger connoisseur considering I've traveled and lived all over the world tasting burgers and fries. I even barbecue and pan fry a fantastic burger myself ;) Thanks to my sister ;) Red Robin has become my new favorite blue ribbon burger place, the staff is friendly and attentive and the service is efficient enough to help create a great atmosphere for friends and family!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=40

Christel L.,"Murrieta, CA",571,641,1647,3.0,10/12/2014,"Your standard Red Robin. The food isn't outstanding or what I would consider ""gourmet"", but the food fills you up.  Most burgers are around $10 with bottomless steak fries included. The sauces are pretty good (BBQ, Honey Mustard, Ranch), but if you want to try out some specialty sauces, they'll cost you extra. Out of all the burgers I've tried (nearly all of them over the years), the Prime Chophouse I had here was one of the tastiest. The Bacon Cheeseburger and Whiskey River BBQ are solid choices as well. On the upscale (expensive) portion of the menu, the Smoke & Pepper Burger I tried here would have been good if the juice hadn't drenched the ciabatta bun, so it fell apart in my hands. If you're looking to save money, get the Red's Tavern Double, but don't expect much.  They've eliminated Happy Hour specials at the bar and basically price-tiered a bunch of appetizers and drinks. I would skip the appetizers and go for an entree. The drinks are all right, some even bottomless, and the addition of boozy shakes are cool. As for the service and facility, so-so. You're going to have to wait to be seated a while if with a group, and the outdoor patio loses the ambiance of the restaurant. Also, rolling out the tablets for ordering seemed either premature or unnecessary since a server will always come to your table anyway. The functions are still limited and the germaphobe in me slightly freaks out at the thought of having to touch screens that previous diners handled during/after stuffing their mouths, before I even get my own food. The location of this Red Robin is convenient at the center of the mall, so a lot of people will come here. Expect it to be busy often, but your food will usually turn out okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=40

I ordered 2 burgers over the phone during my lunch at work to be ready for pick up when i got off at 330. I showed up only to find that my order was NEVER PLACED and no one knew anything of it. So a manager (lela) comes out (didn't appologize) and only offers to start making the food that should have already been ready to go. Unfortunately I could not wait for the food to be made so my girlfriend needed to leave for work at 4pm.

I waited sometime before writing this review, thinking perhaps I missed something or perhaps looking at things differently. I felt, I did not, if I could give this restaurant less then five stars I would have.  We arrived around 5:45pm on March 25th. This place was busy! We were told that our wait time was going to be approx 10 to 15 mins, I was very surprised at the wait time given the fact the restaurant was so busy. Well we waiting 30 min, you'd think they would just tell us 30min?  Once we were sat, our server, Julia Ra, she was very helpful at first, she took our drink order, A beer and a glass of sangria. She came back within a few minutes with our order, then took our dinner order.  We ordered the barbecue chicken wrap, easy enough and a simple bacon cheeseburger with crispy fries. Are only request to Julia was that, the fries be ""EXTRA CRISPY"" and away she went, and then the waiting, and we waited, and waited! We did see she had enough time to chat in front of us to the busboy.  Our food was finely brought 24min later to the table, by an expediter I am assuming. And ""YES"" the fries were NOT crispy! Soon there after, Julia showed back up to the table and then quickly said, ""I know that's not how you ordered the fries, I've ordered more for you but they will take while! Question? ""THEN WHY DID THEY BRING THEM, if it's not what I ordered? So she took back the ones that were initially brought. And the waiting began again, in the mean time we started our meal, got half way through with our meal, and here come the fries, exactly as we ordered them the first time, late but hot and crispy.  At this point we were never to see our server Julia Ra. never to check on us again. We wanted to ask for more fries, but couldn't, so we paid at the kiosk at the table. At that point I wanted to find a manager, to share my experience. I found her sorting menu's, handed her my card and said, ""I have just experienced some REALLY bad service and thought you should know"" I was then told by the manager, with attitude, Why didn't I come up to her or find her earlier. I was very surprised that answer and didn't know that it was my responsibility as a customer to go find a manager, I would assume that a manager would be aware of unhappy customers through their staff, but wait, Julia Ra. never came back!  We left at 7:24pm shaking our heads we vowed never to return! Want to wish you good luck, this place is screaming for guidance and leadership.

Finally she shows up and take our names down and said it will be like 5 mins, my wife requested to have two high chairs for our two young children. Then wait about tens minutes and the host lets us know they don't have anymore high chairs and if booster seats will be okay. Which for the older child who is 2 that's fine but we still need at least one. So we wait about 20 more minutes. My children are started to get a like crazy waiting for a table. Then at the table they have a big chair that is the height for a bar table, so my child's feet are on top of the table , how is she supposed to eat off the table if she is so high up. Then we asked if another high chair comes available if we could switch it out to get one where she could actually eat her food. After that they brought us the wrong kids meal so now the kids are getting more impatient. Then Have to wait even longer for the food. While my wife and I can't eat because the kids aren't eating yet. So another wasted trip out where we couldn't eat and had a horrible time.

Stephanie L.,"Murrieta, CA",1,27,10,2.0,9/3/2016,"Went here for a ""free birthday burger"". My husband was told it would be a 5 minute wait. It was a Friday night but there were MANY (more than 1/2 of the restaurant) was open tables. As we have both been servers and worked in the restaurant industry we understand that there may have no been enough servers on yet, ok. Almost 20 min later, we were finally seated.  After getting off to sort of a negative start, the waitress took our drink order and then our order. Chips and salsa was TINY. Maybe a 4 oz portion cup of salsa? Like something you would put a side of ranch in, for 5 people? She should have warned us that it was pretty small. Good thing the salsa was way too spicy for our kids, it was enough for the 3 adults in our party.  Next two of us shared a burger and added soup. Soup was $3.50 EACH for maybe a small, again, 4 oz portion. I have little sauce dishes at home this size, very disappointing. Maybe lower the price to $1.99 for something this small. Also the soup was brought out with our burger and fries, so we got to choose between eating cold soup after the burger, or cold burger after the soup  She said the fish platter was delicious, and perhaps it is to some, but my husband said it tasted like a platter of frozen fish. We realize red robin isn't a fish place; but he felt it tasted like it had been thawed and then re frozen, then served. Just overall not a good value for $15.99 or whatever. The 70$ we spent there for frozen fish, small side items and one burger shared was overall disappointing. This did include 2 kid pasta meals).  Server was ok but seemed to come back to us like 3 times as we were finished but we hardly saw her after putting in drink order.  I wouldn't say we would never return, I would just ask about portion sizes and be more specific with my requests when I order (please bring out the soup first, etc) we also weren't able to use the free burger coupon because it was one of 4 burgers that were excluded from the promotion.

I asked if I could have some other protein added to the salad, but was told no (nicely, but still no).

He came back and said ""Yes , and everyone's check has already been discounted."" We did not have one of the kiosk at our table  to pay ,so the server disappeared for a while to find one. When he came back with the kiosk the server said ""I just talked to my other manager and he said we aren't doing the discount so all your checks are back to the original price.""  We understood but it was frustrating to tell us we had the discount then taking it away. Overall, great food, very clean, and the server was great.

They were there about two min before two employees came around from the back and grabbed the party and ushered them to the patio and sat and started waiting on them. Another 20 min goes by, its now 8 pm and no one has called us. We go in and ask what's going one seeing as how all parties have been sat now. We were finally sat and the manager apologized for the wait and the fact that the other party was sat in front of us. The manager also said if we ordered two appetizers she would comp them and asked that we order them with her. So we did. Our apps came, our food came.

Our server (named Kait) didn't bother to say anything until about a minute before the food came out that our order was coming up. When the food finally arrived, the server just dropped it off and walked away without saying a word. The food was very mediocre. The burgers hardly had anything on them. I had the Mac and Cheese Tavern thing. It had one wilted small piece of lettuce and the Mac and Cheese was about 5 macaroni noodles. The burgers had no taste at all. My kid's child plate had about enough food for a 4 year old to eat and she is 10. The food was just cheap on quality and quantity. Our server never refilled our drinks. She asked one time if we wanted refills, left and never came back. She never offered additional bottomless fries. The people behind us asked her twice for bottomless fries, which she never brought to them. The pay at table device never gave us a receipt.

It was well cooked just the way i asked for it and really juicy and tasted great.  Bottomless steak fries are a bonus and the season salt on them makes them even better.   Not really much else to say about Red Robin.

John G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/8/2016,Sadly we had a very poor experience tonight and it was most certainly due to our waitress and consequently the manager. It began when we initially sat down and had our drink order taken she walked away from our table before my wife could even finish getting her request out. We assumed it was because she was having a rough day because it was certainly not do to the restaurant being busy in fact it was less than a third full from what we could see. She then came back took our order and that went okay. Our food arrived in time and the food itself was decent as it usually is. This is where things took a turn for the worse she did not come back to our table for the entire time we were there and we kept asking passing servers for things like Phillips on drinks forks and napkins. At the end of the meal I finally asked bypassing server if he could find my waitress and get me our check. After about 5 minutes she arrived apologized place the check on the table and simply walked away. I was paying in cash so we waited for 15 minutes before we finally got up walked to the front and ask the hostess if she could find our waitress so I could get my change. At that point my wife walked outside with my kids thinking it wouldn't be very long and I kid you not when I say this but it was another 15 minutes sitting in at this point a nearly empty restaurant waiting for someone to bring me back my change I asked for the manager who took another 5 minutes to come out and asked me what is it that I need it I explained the situation he went back was gone for an additional 10 minutes before coming back with my change and not even an apology. So in total we sat for close to an hour after we had paid our check waiting for our change. I explain to him the situation but frankly I don't think he cared.

However,  towards the end of our meal, Brittany, who we had never met, comes over to our table and without introducing herself or explaining anything,  asks my daughter to hand her the ziosk. My daughter was using it as she had been playing a game on the ziosk and had reached a high level. Despite this,  Brittany takes the ziosk and says ""I think you have the wrong one"". She then proceeds to reset the ziosk and sets it down on the table next to us and gives us a new one. Really? Was that really necessary to do at that moment?  Still no explanation,  no ""I'm sorry"", no eye contact, she just walked away. I don't think I have ever given a 1 star before but this ruined our dinner outing with my daughter. THEN, when we looked at our bill on the ziosk, we see we were charged $1.99 as an ""entertainment"" fee. Um, I don't think so!

Their salad that has bar-b-que sauce on it is absolutely to die for, sorry I don't remember the name just the picture. Recently they got new menus so you no longer have to worry about punching the person sitting next to you in the face while reading it, they are now a much smaller version and in book form.  Strawberry (Freckled) Lemonade is delecious, sometimes too many strawberries floating around for me but some people love that.

John F.,"Temecula, CA",1,8,,1.0,6/18/2015,"We are semi-regular customers, maybe eat here 4-5 times a year.  Typically we have OK service and restaurant is basically clean for a place that looks like it hasn't been remodeled since a few presidents ago. Not this time. Stopped in on a recent weeknight with my kids for a burger around 5:00PM.  Restaurant was basically empty except for a couple of tables.  Host took 3-4 minutes to s-l-o-w-l-y wander to the front desk.   Strike 1 - He had no smile and a shaggy unkempt beard.  I don't like people with shaggy facial hair around my food.  At least he wasn't our server.   Strike 2 - he led us to the closest table to the restrooms, not my favorite spot to sit.  Especially in a near-empty restaurant.  So I asked for a booth instead, and he whined that they don't usually give parties of three a booth (really?).  I looked around and figured out why.   Strike 3 - All the booths were very messy and it was obvious the tables had sat dirty for a while.  Maybe since the lunch hour.  He said it would a a few minutes to clean a booth.  This was at 5:00PM on a weekday, not exactly a peak time, but the exact time everyone should be busting their tails to get ready for the supper rush.   No one seemed concerned that the place looked like hell.  Two waitresses were back at the bar yakking loudly and flirting with the bartender.  No busboys in sight.  We waited a few minutes and walked out.  If the front of the house was that unclean and nobody cared I can only imagine the conditions in the kitchen.  With BJ's, Burgers & Beer, 5 Guys, TGI Fridays, Islands, Karl Strauss, and more all within 5 minutes there's no reason to eat at this particular Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=100

It has most definitely gone downhill since I had been here last. It seemed empty and run down. I sat in the bar area with my boyfriend and there was an ipad type tablet sitting on the table. It gave us a choice to order alcohol, appetizers, or dessert. We just wanted water so were confused on how to get them ordered...we used the ""call server button"" and our waitress came over to take our order. When she left we started messing around with the tablet and played a trivia game while we waited. Our food came out quick and was pretty decent. We ordered dessert on the tablet also. Then came the bill... We checked it out on the tablet and noticed we were charged a 1.99$ entertainment fee apparently for the trivia game.....for which we were not aware we were going to be charged for.

Fatty D.,"Menifee, CA",3,36,,1.0,1/27/2015,"This was the last bastion of hope for Red Robin; we used to loooove Red robin. We used to crave their freckled lemonade and fries. We have given up on other locations but held firm to the belief that Temecula was still quality.  We went in last night, beckoned by a free birthday burger. My husband had to claim it even though our last Red Robin experience at a different location had been so, so sad.  We went in, full of hope. Hope that slowly started to die the moment we sat at our sticky, icky table. I pulled out my handy pack of baby wipes and got to work, hesitating with the looming break up. Our server was pleasant, got our food out quickly and assured us it was okay that the kids play with the device that was slapped in front of their faces on our table (the last time we ate here our table, for some reason, did not have the device on it - which we were sad about at the time; now we know better). The food arrived, we said a prayer and dug in. And that quickly, we knew it was over. Our long standing relationship with Red Robin must end. Our fries were cold, the kid's corn dogs were cold, burgers were bland- just ok, chicken platter was edible but that is the best I can say about it. Nothing exciting. Even the freckled lemonade was.... Bad. Too sweet? Like they just threw a bunch of berries in randomly with no notion of how it would taste with those crazy proportions. To top it off we noticed their prices have gone up. Maybe they went up before, but this was the first time we noticed it. Even with the free birthday burger our total for several people was much higher than expected. For that price we could have had sushi or steak- and we didn't even have alcoholic drinks! And there was an ""entertainment charge"" on our bill that we had no idea was coming. We imagine that it was because the kids used the device? We saw no warning of impending payment but I suppose it is possible one of he kids swiped it away. We finished up quietly, sad that even the kids under 10 years of age left their french fries behind. Honestly... That is perhaps the most telling detail. Kids leaving their french fries behind?? When does that ever happen? So, it is with a broken Teriyaki chicken sandwich loving heart that I must bid adieu to Red Robin. There are just too many other good food choices in the area. Somewhere a few years ago someone at Red Robin must have decided to start cutting corners... But judging by the more than half empty restaurant we are not the only ones who have noticed. If we had only known this back when we first started to notice the changes we could have said our proper good-byes to those bottomless fries and the freckled lemonades.

I came here with my family and she kindly took our orders. The food came in on time and my 4 year old daughter loved the food so much she actually finished her meal. She's normally a very picky eater and never finishes her meals but she was very happy about this place. My husband asked if they give military discount and she said yes, no questions asked, and gave us the discount.  We came back again the following day because my daughter loved the food so much, and even though my husband and I already had dinner we took our daughter anyways. This time, however, we had a different server. Jessica seemed to lack professionalism and wasn't very friendly. We only ordered a kids meal for my daughter and drinks for me and my husband, but Jessica didn't seem too happy about that. My husband then asked her for a military discount and she seemed very unsure and hesitant and told us that they don't give military discount. I told her that we were given a discount the last time we were here and she went to clarify it. When she came back, she gave us the discount and said ""I put in the discount but it was only 98 cents."" My husband and I felt very offended and her comment was so unnecessary. We didn't care about how much of a discount we were given. For us, it's not just about the discount. As being part of the military, I want my husband to feel appreciated for serving our country and he felt very disrespected by her.

Didn't catch her name but she was a tall blond. But I must say her niceness didn't outweigh her TERRIBLE service! It took forever to get our drinks. First came our water and teas (the water was disgusting! Tasted like it was full of chemicals). Then it took another 10 minutes to get our bar drink. She said she was bringing an extra straw but never did. Then we wait and wait and wait for our food while she is busy talking on and on with other customers. FINALLY we get our food. It was very good. Our server tells us she will be bringing out more bottomless fries. We wait and wait and wait again. My friend finally catches her attention and mentions we are still waiting for our fries. She says ""Oh, you want more fries? (as she giggles), I'll get those for you""....Uh, Miss,  you originally told us yourself you were bringing us more fries 20 minutes ago. So we wait and wait and wait again and watch as hangs out near the bar and never once goes near the kitchen. OH and don't let me forget...never ONCE did we see a busboy and dirty tables were left without clearing the entire time we were there!. We finally pay our bill on the kiosk, without ever getting the fries we asked for, and I'm sure she knows the ""rest"".

Harold S.,"Temecula, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/5/2015,"On or about August 4, 2015 my wife, daughter, grandson and I ordered food form your Red Robin restaurant located in Temecula, California.  My daughter and grandson ordered hamburgers and my wife and I ordered the chicken Caesar lettuce wrap.   Despite the restaurant not being crowded we waited over 30 minutes to finally receive our order. After eating I paid 76 dollars to include a 10 dollars tip.  As soon as we left my wife began having stomach pains and needed to be rushed to the bathroom.  When we arrived home I began getting hard stomach pains also and had to use the bathroom.  We both were in different bathrooms of our home vomiting, diarrhea, and having a severe stomach pain.  We both felt like we were going to die.  This was the worst pain that we have ever experienced.   The weird thing is that my wife and I did not eating anything the entire day.  I believe either in the preparation phase, or prior to serving phase of the making of the wraps was the issue. I believe the item was not prepared correctly for human consumption or it sat a long period of time waiting for prior orders.  The bottom line is that it only takes one time to get sick and we never want to eat out again.   My family, friends and I will never eat at any Red Robin ever again.  Every time a restaurant has the pleasure of providing an above level of service it should be committed to do everything in their power to reach that standard every time.  This was not the case at Red Robin.  Terrible experience.

M G.,"Pacoima, Los Angeles, CA",3,14,,5.0,3/28/2015,"Visited this location on 3/21/15. Walked in and was greeted by the girls at the front. They weren't too great, but no big deal. Was told 5 minute wait, ended up 15 minutes instead. Finally got seated. Ryan came over and took our drink order. And when we ordered our food, he came back a minute or two later and brought us some fries while we waited. Never have I been to a Red Robin where they have done that. He was super nice and attentive even while waiting. He came back with our food, and we asked him for some utensils. A couple minutes passed by, and he apologized that it took so long. Due to the lack of utensils up front, he had to go to the back and get them. Was so nice about it. After we paid for our bill, without asking for anything else, he came back over with our drinks in a to go cup and said just in case you wanted some for the road. In my experience, never has a waiter done this. I asked to speak to a manager and I told him how great Ryan was. So very nice, apologetic when a couple mishaps happened, brought fries while we were waiting, and to go drinks just because. The manager told us that Ryan is one of his newer servers. Ryan sets the bar for how other servers should be. I would go back based on my experience because of him. He is so great. And the food was good as well.

Endless potatoes with the burgers...Tasted mine as well as my family's, it was tasteless.   They could have at least seasoned it a little. for appetizer we got the wings and chips full. It was  about 8 pcs of half wings and loads of potato chips underneath. Seems expensive. Also got the artichoke dip. the first few chips were chewy, the others were newly cooked and crispier. Little dip.I ordered ribs and clucks. It was about 13.99. I got 2 small chicken strips and about  8 small ribs. the ribs were like beef jerky. Seems like it was fried too long then bbq sauce were poured in it. half part of ot was soft, half of it I have to pull it hard to eat it. The waitress was friendly But she keeps forgetting things. My order was 5 min. later than my family but by time I got it, my family was almost done eating. the extra patty requested by my son was forgotten, the napkin was forgotten until we reminded her. The coleslaw that came with my order is short on taste. It needs more dressing I suppose. To be fair both my sons finished their burger.

There were only a few tables of people so we anticipated we would have a quick service and we were hungry... The onion ring tree was empty for over ten minutes before our food arrived and the fries on both my son and my own plate were not simply cool they were cold. We had to wait for some time for our server to come back by so we could even bring it to her attention and ask for some hot fries, she seemed as if it was no big deal and went off on her way. I needed to use the restroom and on the way saw that she was chatting with a person in street clothes by the entrance to the kitchen, and she was still there when I came out. I paid attention after sitting back at the table and watched as they talked for about another 10 minutes. I'm sure the rest of the establishment is more than likely run fairly efficiently and the food, when hot is probably great however there is only ONE shot at a first impression and ours was not a good one at all unfortunately and we wont be back for a second chance, even when we return next week. Friends are great, but not when they interrupt work, the server should have taken a break and allowed another server to assist our table if it was important that she speak with her friend right at that moment although the laughs shared indicated it wasnt all that important...

The last two times that we have been there it has been truly a different story. Today we made the mistake of going back again after the problems we incurred last time and the problems have gotten worse. It was 1105 am on a Saturday 9-26 we were told that we would have to wait for a table 15 minutes or so when there was thirty plus empty tables in the restaurant or go and eat in the bar for immediate. So we went into the bar, waitress came over and asked us for our order and then we waited and we waited and we waited, no beer delivered, no food delivered and after 30 minutes and the newbies next to us starting getting food and drink after 5 minutes; I told my wife get up we are leaving. At 1137 we got up and left. Headed to Islands, we were seated immediately (NO WAIT) we had our food and drinks in less than 10 minutes the service was fast and efficient everything was cooked to order and it was spectacular. Even the manager came to our table to see how everything was. Where was the Red Robin manager why didn't he come by and ask us how everything was??? The atmosphere is cold and the service is totally nonexistent. They must have had a management change. The previous managers were always there greeting and making sure that you were happy with you meal and the service, but they're no longer to be seen and the place is definitely way under staffed. The wait staff seems unhappy and overworked; the hostess is totally stressed out from the customers' yelling at her because there are so many empty tables and she can't seat the customers because there is AN INSUFFICIENT WAIT STAFF PRSENT to take care of them. A few weeks ago we had the same problem with getting seated at 11am, YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO WAIT FOR A TABLE WHEN THE RESTAURANT IS EMPTY.

Cassi M.,"San Diego, CA",82,97,114,3.0,1/12/2010,"I think this Red Robin has a thing with Ranch.  Seriously, every time I come here, subsequently by the end of the evening we end up with no less than eight little red cups of the stuff!   But other than their adoration of lil side dips, they do an A-Ok job on everything else.  The servers are generally really friendly. Its a bit smaller than most Red Robin locations that I've been to.. so that makes it slightly more difficult when I come here with a larger group of amigos. So.. my friend and I came here at random after braving the day after Christmas gift  card shoppers.  Despite it being PACKED, we were able to walk in without so much as a head nod to the 500 hostesses (okay well maybe like eight people -- but is that many really necessary?). I always ask for my fries early -- they're ""bottomless"" (i suppose it sounds better than ""unlimited"" -- lol) and that served as our ""appetizer""..  Well at least until my friend decided to load up on the calories and ordered the mozarella sticks as well.   Drinks here are overpriced (which is poots because the strawberry lemonade is awesome here) so we usually just get water.  And get the BBQ burger with the onion straws -- MMMM! Food is good but its one of those places where you pay ten bucks for a hamburger -- not gonna happen every week.  =_="" sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=200

I normally do their to go orders since I work in the mall and I don't have time on my lunch break to sit there and have them remake my incorrect order. I just had lunch there today and not only were my fries not crispy, about half of them weren't even cooked all the way and were soggy and gross.

I've been to this location probably a dozen times and i've never had a problem with service or food.  In fact, I'd venture to say that this place has the best wings in Temecula. I've had wings at wings n things, lucille's, hooters, buffalo wild wings, yardhouse, TGIFs, BJs, etc. These wings are the best. Perfect amount of sauce, perfect hotness, and grilled crispy the way wings should be. Burgers are also decent, as are drinks.

Chris A.,"Gilbert, AZ",47,112,65,1.0,4/6/2009,"I love Red Robin! Their burgers and shakes are delicious!! So, why the bad review? Two words, bad service. My boyfriend and I visited the Temecula Red Robin one weekend and had the worst service ever! Our server apparently forgot that we existed. We arrived excited to have some yummy food and were greeted by a nice hostess who promptly sat us on the patio since it was a lovely day. After that, everything went sour. The server didn't show up to introduce herself and take drink orders for over 10 minutes, 10 minutes after that when she finally remembered to bring our iced tea and glass of water that she spilled on me! ""Oh, excuse me ma'am, my apologies"" words that did not come out of her mouth but should have. She was so busy worrying about another table that she didn't even notice that I was now soaking wet. She eventually came back to take our order, ""refilling"" my water and AGAIN wetting ME! I was starting to think this chick had something against me! So then, we wait about 30 minutes for one burger and a salad, maybe the cooks were  on break or something (?) but honestly, by this time I was done with this experience! Our burger was wrong, and my salad was not prepared as requested (dressing on the side). We proceeded to keep our eye out for the server and request the check, which arrived another 20 minutes later.   Sorry Red Robin, your Temecula location will get no more business from me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=220

M P.,"Santee, CA",7,114,1,3.0,4/29/2009,"My first time at Red Robin. I didn't dislike it, but it wasn't anything special. It's great to have another burger place that doesn't insist on killing your meat again; you can order a medium burger. (I'd prefer a med. rare, but oh well.) I had the Banzai and there was practically no teriyaki sauce. My friend had a BBQ one and asked for more sauce. They only had maybe a tablespoon sauce each. Though it's nice that they put the sauce between layers so it doesn't sop into the bun. The meat itself lacked seasoning and could have used some basic salt. I was really disappointed in the overall flavor of the burger. The fries were good, and I loved the unlimited factor, though I couldn't eat much. My husband would have ordered several rounds. Their special seasoning salt poured out way too fast, but was good on the fries. My daughter's milk was unlimited, which was nice, though her little tummy rejected the mass amount of fluid. The waitress quickly got the busboy and they both helped clean up. The manager came and checked on us three times, which paired with the waitress, was a little too much attention.  A manager's attention once is more than enough and once was unexpected and nice to see he cared about the service. At $30 for 2 people, the price was too high for my likes. I have no problem shelling out money for a good meal, but this just didn't meet the mark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-temecula?start=220

I order the Mushroom & Swiss burger and a beer. The burger is pretty tasty and cooked to order. It comes with never-ending fries.
