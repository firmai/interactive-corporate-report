Now it's dry. The chicken came out completely dry. Very sub par. You come to expect a level of service and their actions show they give you otherwise.

68,Sarah M.,"Manteca, CA",218,263,420.0,2.0,2012-08-22,I normally like Applebees but this location disappoints me. The service I get when I come is usually just ok (neither good or bad) and the food is well......not good. I came here tonight and got the Fiesta Lime Chicken which is normally a really good entree. Well this location has managed to mess it up. The chicken was very dry and there was hardly any zesty lime sauce on the chicken which was a major disappointment because that is a major part of the dish. My husband ordered the Three Cheese Chicken Penne and that was very bland also. He basically got noodles with tomatoes and chicken only; hardly any cheese or Alfredo sauce. The only good that we ordered tonight was the Boneless Wings with the Southern BBQ sauce. The sauce had a perfect mix of sweet and tang and that the only good food that we ordered tonight. Then for dessert I had one of those Hot Fudge Sundae Shots. They even managed to make that disappointing. They barely put any hot fudge in it and the ice cream was not that cold as if it had not been the freezer very long. All in all this particular Applebees is far less superior in quality to the other locations I have eaten at. I would recommend skipping this location and trying another one if you want Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-manteca-4?start=120,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.12,2.44

63,Christina R.,"Manteca, CA",0,3,3.0,1.0,2013-06-28,"I've been a customer since they opened. I've always gone to them for a quick lunch were tasty dinner. Unfortunately the last few times I went,  my food came out under cooked, cold, and tasteless. I will no longer go back in there after the service I received my last time. Our waitress forgot that she even have a job as a waitress there  and completely ignored her tables including mine and even decided to sit with another table for over 5 minutes. We received hot sodas and beers, cold appetizers, a raw and bloody hamburger, an entree that was completely wrong, and a salad with a zip tie in it. Manager for the night did not address any of the issues and our waitress gave such a horrible attitude that we ended up walking out. I wish I could say I want to go back, but I feel as if there will be no solution to their declining quality in service and food. There are lot of new faces in there from waitresses and managers. I hope they're able to better improve their staff. It's such a shame that there's not another place in Manteca like them to dine at.

8,Riza S.,"Tenderloin, San Francisco, CA",35,3,,2.0,2013-12-22,"I don't like to post negative Yelp reviews. I'm a hotelier and restaurateur. Negative reviews are damaging. But this is a chain and at a chain, I expect the sort of neighborhood service that Applebee's advertises. On 12/22 at around 2:15pm, I walked in with my mother. There was another couple of ladies waiting and apparently they had been standing there for quite some time. No one had greeted them. No host to be seen. We stood there for another 5-8 minutes. I know that 5 minutes doesn't seem like a long time, but when you're a customer ANYWHERE, being ignored for more than 30 seconds is not a good feeling. A server walked by and didn't say hello. The shift manager walked up to the desk and instead if saying ""Hi, have you been helped yet?"" or ""I'm sorry for the wait, can I help you?"" He simply looked at his clipboard and said ""Did she get your name yet?"" ...who?! There hasn't been anyone at the door! Poor leadership skills, there! Own your areas! And you could have seated the two ladies who had been waiting for over 20 minutes instead of saying ""Okay, she'll get you seated,"" take ownership and do it yourself! And to the hostess, I believe your name was Dayana (yeah, that's what name tags are for), usually the first thing you say to waiting people is ""hello"" or ""sorry for the wait"" and you know what? If you're having a bad day or someone's pissed you off or you hate your job, the guests can see it. Don't walk guests to the table as if it was the most deplorable thing you've been asked to do. There's other people in Manteca who need jobs and will probably do it with a lot more respect for the operation than you do. And I got a dirty plate. Lovely. No food on the table (we were waiting) but the share plate was dirty. Nice water soaked melted cheese attached to it. Manteca Applebee's, you're currently sitting at 2.5 stars. This isn't the only review that says service sucks. That's a sign.

We were sitting right below a blaring speaker and could not hear each other talk over the music. We got up and moved our seat with no problems.  My wife and I ordered our drinks and an appetizer. We waited over 10 mins to get our drinks and probably only got them because we had to ask for them again. We ordered a sampler plater as an appetizer. And didn't wait very long for it to arrive to our table. When we got the sampler plater we ordered our dinner. My wife other editors a chicken sandwich and I a mushroom Swiss burger. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare. We noticed customers who came in much later than us order and get their food before us. After waiting nearly an hour, we asked about our good. A server, who was not our server, brought us our food. The sandwiches were cold, fries tasted cold, stale and over salted. My burger was not medium rare. It was WELL done and burned on the ends.

The customers at the table next to us continued to complain, even after they got their food and the manager came out and apologized profusely. Our waitress kept apologizing for the wait but honestly, we didn't wait long at all for our entrees. My steak was medium rare, hot and yummy. My mashed potatoes were lukewarm, but it was no biggie.

101,Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398.0,1.0,2015-12-09,"I ate here with my coworkers today. We had a party of 7 total and sat at the bigger round table (back left of the restaurant). We were greeted by our waitress Jessica after about 7-10 minutes sitting down. After everyone ordered their drinks, I spoke up and told her I think everyone's ready to order. I wasn't 100% sure if everyone was onboard and ready to order, but the people who were ready went first while the couple others made their lunch selection. I spoke up prematurely to get our orders put, because I had a feeling it'd take awhile to get drinks out. Where I work, we're given an hour lunch. We had come here a time or two within the past couple months and had always been able to get in and out during the hour. The food has always been decent and the service has always varied based on server. The 7-10 minute wait for the waitress to come up and introduce herself ended up foreshadowing an even greater waiting time for the food.  There was actually a point during this visit where I thought the Cooks in the back had died. Over 30 minutes had gone by and nothing was coming out of the kitchen. Not even any of our appetizers. I was looking around at what looked I thought was a non-busy lunch service and literally saw no food coming out onto any tables. Jessica continued being attentive and refilled our drinks, but never mentioned she would go check on the food for us. After 40 minutes of waiting a couple started joking around at our table, 'did the cooks go on lunch break?', 'are they on smoke break or something?' You could tell their sense of humor was showing through as a veil clothing the frustration of the waiting period. Around 50 minutes had gone by and there was no visual sign of any food being brought out, no manager walking around on the floor assisting staff, and no one giving us any heads up of what was going on in the kitchen. I don't know if a cook or two quit half way into lunch service or what, it came off like the kitchen was completely cold.  We flagged down Jessica as she was walking by and told her to tell the cooks that we needed to get the food boxed up and take it to go. We also needed help on splitting the checks 7 different ways manually because the Ziosk at the table wasn't working properly. Jessica went to the back and told them to box everything and must've not realized how much time had past. I'm assuming this because there was no apology about not getting any food to our table, and it hitting a point where we spent our whole lunch hour sitting around drinking tea, lemonade, and water. She informed us they were boxing it all up and got together everyone's checks split up appropriately. Finally onto the food here. I ordered the 2 for $24 with a co-worker. We both went with the chicken tender platter. The platter is an additional $2 on top of the standard chicken tender basket. You're promised a larger portion of food in the platter. After the even split, my tab was around $16 and some change. It was $12 and some change for the chicken tender platter and $2-3 for the drink plus tax. I mention the price for you to make a correlation with the image of the food I ended up receiving. The food was far from warm. When you're given fresh hot food in a plastic to-go box, the steam automatically starts fogging up the plastic container the food is in. The to-go container stayed clear the whole time and it had me wondering how long ago the food had actually been cooked. The icing on the cake here was that they forgot to include any dipping sauces for everyones meals. One in my party had ordered an oriental chicken salad and they gave him no dressing. They didn't even pack in any to go plasticware. To say this visit replicated my past visits here would be a lie. Obviously we saw this place as a decent spot to come for food if we had visited it a couple times somewhat recently. What's strange is the last time we were here, the staff seemed very cheery, jolly, and more than willing to teach the customers how to use the Ziosk's at the tables to help lighten your server's load. This time around it's like the place literally did a full 180 degree turn for the worst. I'm more than disappointed here. The portion sizes have always seemed fair and the food has always tasted fine. Not only did we end up wasting our time for horrible food, I felt ripped off paying a couple bucks extra to upsize my meal and get a laughable portion size. I'm not trying to come off cheap here. I want you to mentally correlate a $20 meal (when you include tip) with the food I received in my attached photo. If they continue down this track, this location won't be around much longer. I am beyond amazed at how you can have good service/food one day, only to return a couple weeks later and leave feeling like you should of just ordered at a jack in the box.  I don't plan on returning to this location anytime soon. I don't know if there's been major staff changes or what happened but this place is going downhill big time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-manteca-4?start=40,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.148,3.0000000000000004

The wait wasn't bad, only about 15 mins for them to prepare our table. We ordered several appetizers which were just average in flavor. Also along with the appetizers came dirty plates.  We ordered spinach dip, salsa, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo wings. The only appetizer worth getting again would be the boneless buffalo chicken wings. When our entrees finally came my ribs were nearly cold. I did not enjoy the cold ribs. Food overall below average  The customer services was also below average. It seemed impossible to get a refill on my drink. I noticed several waitresses see my empty glass and avoided eye contact with me so I could not ask for a refill. I even moved my glass around to ensure they would notice I needed it to be filled.

I wanted to eat at a sit down restaurant. Applebee's was the nearest! We came around 8:00P was seating in about 10 minutes and the lady told us our server will be with us shortly. SHORTLY.  This was the first time Jess and I hung out outside of work (weird story how we met) so we were really just talking and catching up on everything. Why did 25 minutes pass and I finally said, ""Where's our server at?"" to her. We both must've looked at each other like damn.. We really been sitting here for stupid long and nobody still has served us. So I stopped one of the workers and asked, ""Hey, can we get a server?"" She immediately apologizes for our long wait and said she's going to be right back to get the server. We go back to our conversation and we get a little into it and forget that another 15 minutes have passed. NO SERVER still? I stop a different person who works there and say, ""We've been waiting for almost 30 minutes now and still no server???"" Again, another lame ass apology and a ""I'll get your server right now"" Now we finally have our server. Got our drinks down and ordered the food. Another 25-30 minute wait for the food. We're over here starving like uh.. Why did we get here at 8:00P and didn't get our food until about 9:15P? Hmm... doesn't seem right to me. We should've left at 9:15P if anything. Ordered 2 for $20! Delicious and big portions. Server didn't check on us once. Had to stop him to refill our EMPTY glasses... hmph... We didn't leave until almost 10:00P. Sorry, but no.

56,Jordan Rey C.,"Lathrop, CA",54,5,,1.0,2016-11-21,"Probably the worst Applebee's I've been to.... Had dinner with my friend. The option we had was either Mikasa or Applebee's, which we ended up going to the latter. We were greeted as normally but we're told that there's no booth available, the store was half full when we came in, so we ended up taking the seats next to the bar. Sat down and everything, got our server and such. Our order was taken. About 30 minutes had passed and our appetizer wasn't served yet, which was the boneless chicken wings dressed with the spicy sweet asian child. And so it came, it was actually quite good, the only complaint I had was the sauce was super cold, in contrast to the warm chicken nuggets (less wings, more like nuggets). 10 minutes has passed, we were clearly done with our appetizer and our server was busy serving more customers. Another 15 minutes had passed and out main course has finally arrived, way after when the ones next to us got theirs (and they came in 30 minutes after us). I got my favorite which is the Crispy Brewhouse Chicken. The utensils weren't clean as I expected. My plate was sloppy, it was presented nicely but the side of the plate has drippings of sauce on it and I clearly saw fingerprints on it as well, like it was just reused and never been washed.  The food was good, always consistent. Mashed potato was not too salty, very silky and smooth. Onion rings were a tad oily - wasn't put on a strainer. Chicken was cooked done. I have no complaints on the food only the server was killing me, and the sloppy presentation. I love it when the server passed by our table and asked the table next to us if they were doing okay, but not us two. When the food was all set and done, we were just waiting for our receipt. And the server was busy going back in forth onto those two machines at the back and both sides of the bar. Passed by our table a couple times and never bothered checking my friend's water, which was gone.... What pissed me off the most is that when he just took our plates without asking if he can take or if we are done, which was obvious, gave us the bill ($44.40 for 3 plates -- my guy had a stake with two sides). So we finally paid and all, all he said was ""sorry about that"" and nothing else.  The server needs to remember the basics (last time I recall, he never introduced himself). You may have great food but inferior service will bring you down. Applebee's is only good, when it comes to great food, I've had way better ones. And as far I'm concern, it wasn't worth it paying $44 to have a dinner at a place with such horrible service. Most likely won't give this place another chance. Thus, this ends my review for this place.

The waitress came and took our drink order, she did not seem thrilled to be there and it was obvious in her tone of voice and body language. Other servers served our appetizers,  no plates or silverware. My bf had a water which was refilled not one time. I ordered a pomegranate martini which I finished before dinner came and was not asked if I wanted another. After the orders were put in, I never saw our waitress again until we asked for the bill!!  The salmon came out burned, the soup had soggy tortilla strips in it and the soup was more of a ""spread"" texture than a soup. We had to flag another server down for silverware and napkins, we had to flag another server down to take the soup back (I just asked for it to be removed from the bill). Another server took it back and apologized. Our original server came and said ""what happened?"" And we told her of all the mishaps and how we had to flag others to help us, and she replied with ""oh, we are, down 2 cooks"". We just asked for the bill at that point. After giving our server cash for the bill, 10 minutes later a different server came and handed us our change.

37,Erika M.,"Lathrop, CA",8,5,,1.0,2017-09-27,"Last night at around 730pm on Tuesday 9/26/2017 my family and I went to Applebee's for dinner like we do all the time. The restaurant was not busy we were seated immediately and were ready to enjoy our dinner. Then the series of unfortunate events took place.  My boyfriends mom and dad ordered two perfect margaritas, being that there were only about 10 people in the bar area and a total of about 7 tables seated in the dining area, you would think one would get their drinks in a reasonable time, but this was not the case. It took about 10 min for the server to even realize that they hadn't received their drinks yet! And then another 5 went by and she finally brought them over to the table. My boyfriends mom got about 3 full pours and his dad barely even got one out of his! When he told the server that he didn't even have enough to fill his glass her response was, ""let me go get you a half a glass"", when the answer should have been let me go get you a new one. He politely declined due to the poor customer service that was displayed. The server was absent and not all there. Now Fast forward to when our dinner arrives at the table at the same moment we were thinking about just paying our bill and leaving. We ordered four entrees and one kids meal, which was a corn dog and cheese sticks, the four entrees arrived and no kids meal. Our dinners were not warm, probably because they had been sitting in the kitchen for so long because our server was so absent. So we waited...and waited.. and still no child's meal. Which should have been the first meal to come out being that it is pre made! So about another ten minutes have gone by and if we didn't ask for his meal the server would have never even noticed it was never given to us. My boyfriends dad then asked to speak to a manager when another server came by. The manager comes up to our table and before we even say anything he apologizes!!! We were all thrown off. My boyfriends dad responds to him by saying ""sorry for what?!"" And the manager says, ""that's how they train us to approach the table"", the manager was unprofessional entirely. When we explained what horrible service we had been receiving he apologized and said he wanted to make it right. My boyfriends dad told him I'm not looking to get anything free I just thought you should know the horrible service your restaurant has so you can make it better. The manager said thank you and then left. We will not be going to this Applebee's anymore due to the terrible guest experience this location serves. The manager was not on the floor at all the entire night, normally when we eat here the managers are always on the floor easy to see and going to each table and asking how everything is, this gentleman was absent and in the back until asked for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-manteca-4?start=20,1.64,2.48,2.48,,2.144

My meal was overall flavorless. Even the lemonade was bland (I ended up switching drinks in the middle of the meal). The 2 stars are simply for THE SERVICE. Our server and other waiter who checked on us where both nice and attentive.

Some people can not eat garlic, what's wrong with a baked potato? The waitress was not helpful just thru her hands up and said I don't know why they changed it!

41,Audjeff E.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,4.0,2.0,2017-12-14,"I came here with my family and friends on Saturday. Long story short, EVERYTHING was drenched with salt. Fries, chips & salsa, chicken, wrap sandwich, chicken tenders, etc. I had to ""wipe"" my fries with a napkin before eating it to remove unnecessary amounts of salt. I don't mind a little bit of salt but half our food wasn't edible.  Our bill was discounted and we were not charged for my daughters plate.  Stars are for the really nice manager. He was very customer service friendly and apologetic. The waitress was equally as nice.  We won't be coming back to Applebee's.

Anyways, slow slow slow service, it was quite irritating, plus it seemed like the waitresses had no clue what to do. The music, I know it's a restaurant, and the music shouldn't be that big of a deal, but I have no idea what the heck they were playing. 1. It was excessively loud for the type of music 2. It was just strange, like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Nickel Back, and that Boulder song.

47,Desiree J.,"Newark, CA",206,17,10.0,2.0,2018-01-07,"A friend of mine and i came in after a day of shopping and we live in Manteca so we thought we'd have a quick bite before we go home. Walked in, it was pretty busy, of course since it's a saturday night, but the host just glanced at us as we walked in and smiled as he stood there, no greeting or anything. My friend and i are looking around to find any open seating in the bar area but we just choose to wait for an open table, a few minutes later he then asks ""are you waiting for a seat at the bar?"" And we told him, we're waiting for anything. 15 mins later passed and a table finally opens and he then just says ""i would take it if i were you"" honestly... I've worked in the restaurant business and have always been in customer service and i know it shouldn't be that much of a big deal but it is when you're suppose to be a host, a greeter, the first person customers see and talk to when they walk in a restaurant. If i walked into any place with rude customer service like that, i would have walked right out but everywhere else was busy and we just settled. This is suppose to be a family restaurant and you just tell a customer ""i would take it if i were you"" when a table opens up, the least he could've said is that there's an open table and if we'd like to take it, we can. Being a host is the most simple job in a restaurant, the least you can have is common curtesy to customers when they walk in and not expect them to say something first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-manteca-4,2.08,2.52,2.52,,2.3440000000000003
