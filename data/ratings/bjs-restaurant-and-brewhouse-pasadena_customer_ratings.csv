264,Charity G.,"Shadow Hills, CA",4,23,8.0,4.0,2012-10-29,"I'm guilty of frequenting this place.  I'm on day 3 of my pizzokie and beer diet. Here's the low down: 1. Servers are still on training.  This explains why they are super chipper and their timing is still off (ex: giving the menu and as when she pulls her hand from the menu  asks our table if we already know what we want; puts pizza down the table and asks us right away if we're enjoying the pizza; the spoon is literally halfway between the soup bowl and my mouth and the server asks me if i'm still working on my soup).  Give it another week and the seasoned servers will leave the new ones to swim and float on their own. 2.  Food is consistent in quality.  I can't complain with that. 3. Place seems oddly louder than what it should be.  It's prolly because of the super high ceiling. 4. Tables and booths are pretty crammed next to each other... which means to say you'll be passing by most people when you enter/ leave. 5.  Great lunch menu.  They have unlimited soup and salad for $7!  Order your next soup of liking when they give you your desired first soup for perfect timing.  Their tomato bisque is where it's at. 6.  Iced tea is $2.75.  Draft beer during lunch is $3.50.  You bet I'm not ordering iced tea.  7. Yes, they validate parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=400,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007
222,Cheryl R.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,223,52.0,4.0,2012-10-29,"Just left the restaurant...came here on opening night!  Place was still buzzing at 7:30.  They have a bunch of flat screen tv's and were showing the MNF game so that was cool.  The staff greeted us right when we stepped in...like 4 of them.  All evening we were well taken care of.  There were a lot of trainees walking around with servers- ours was no exception.  It was actually quite adorable watching the trainee taking copious notes about our order :-)  Our server was great and very attentive. The ambiance awesome, as they converted an old bank into the restaurant, but kept a lot of the architecture.  Love the ceiling and the chandeliers!  Of course since it was opening night, everything (tables, booths, chairs, walls, etc) were new and shiny and nice.  They'll get worn over time, but it was fun seeing everything so pristine and new! My husband and I ordered gluten free pizza, regular pizza, and a gluten free pizookie...and they all were delish! On our way out, we were thanked by 7 different people on our walk out...that was cool!  We'll be back for sure...maybe to watch another sports game or something or try their happy hour! ***TIP: On a busy night, you should call about 30min-1hr ahead of the time you plan on getting there to get your name added to the 'call ahead list'.  This will shorten your wait time! ***Not sure who Charity talked to, but when I called, I was told that they did NOT validate parking since they're not part of the Paseo.  I was told to go to Gelsen's to validate.  So not really sure about parking at the moment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=300,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007
70,Leo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1054,640,3499.0,4.0,2012-10-30,"Who doesn't love the going to BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse chain for their deep dish pizza, tasty appetizers, great microbrew beers and famous pizzookie. Finally, an alternative choice to the Yard House hopefully without the long wait. NBA 2012-2013 season starts today so I'm looking forward to coming here to watch the Laker/Clipper games. I attended the grand opening yesterday for lunch. I can't believe there's already a few reviews and check-in about it before the place even opened. I guess after going to a few BJs in SoCal, people think or assume they're all the same. The food and beer maybe, but the decor, ambiance and service is definitely different. The decor is spectacular especially the interior space. This used to be the old Security Pacific Building that was formerly the Premier Jewelery Mall. I love the beautiful high ceilings and ornate design which reminds be more of the Gran Lux cafe. They even kept the original chandeliers and craftsman woodwork. The multi-screen entertainment console at the bar is awesome. Great way to watch multiple games at the same time plus get the latest news report from CNN. In addition, six additional flat screen TVs are available throughout the restaurant. If you want immediate seating for lunch, sit at the bar. Service was pretty awesome today. I think being that it was their grand opening, everyone was at their best behavior. My waiteress Sarah did an exceptional job waiting on me. She was friendly, helpful and polite. My food order came promptly and drink re-filled regularly.  Food is always consistently good at BJ's. With their huge menu selections you're sure to find something you like. Make sure to try their lunch specials starting at $5.95 (14 to choose from). I ordered the southern fried chicken breast served on top mash potatoes and corn succotash with pepper cream gravy. Good portions, savory and tasty. The chicken was tender and lightly crisp on the outside. Good deal! Save room for dessert especially their pizzookie. My favorite is their triple chocolate pizzookie made with Ghirardelli chocolate which is rich and amazing. Definitely will satisfy your chocolate fix and indulgence. Also, try their new raspberry white chocolate almond pizzookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream so decadent and scrumptious.  Parking - Paseo Mall with validation. With so much good food and beer to offer, I'm sure this place will get popular and busy quickly. Can't wait to come back to try all their delicious food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=200,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003
295,Darren M.,"Arcadia, CA",154,49,13.0,4.0,2012-11-01,"Went to opening night for BJs in Old Town Pasadena.  Same reliable fare, but in a really cool setting.  This is, I believe, a converted bank turned jewelry mart, with the beautifully-detailed carved ceiling, dramatic columns reaching up to the ornately-designed crown mouldings, and the overall ambiance of a 30's speakeasy.  Much more character than any other BJs I've been to.   The food is consistently good - what you expect from BJs.  The wings appetizer was perfectly crispy; loved the wedge salad with lots of blue cheese; and the kids loved the pizzas.  Of course, the pazookie was the pinnacle of the evening. On the negative side - parking - there is nothing really close.  They are not, I believe, part of the Paseo Colorado so they do not validate for them.  They have parking across the street which is a bit of a walk.  We were told that they would have valet service which will start very soon and will be a respectable $3.00 or $4.00.

This place is an exception even though it is only one star higher I would give any other chain The location  This BJ's is quite large and it ended up moving into a bank and a jewelry store. Most of the molding is all original. The staff mentioned that some had to retouched. Fun fact is that the bank vault is located below the bar.  The staff is pretty cool i came on the first day of operation and offered a couple slices of pizza from a server walking the grounds. SWEET! My buddy and I hung out at the bar area chatting it up with several of the bartenders who were them awesome. Even though we pretty much became the best of friends with each one of them, they were still well aware of the other patrons running dry of booze running whole length of the bar.

285,Meggan T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,2012-11-10,"This is a new location (open for maybe a month now) and so I will try it one more time in three months and i hope by then things have improved. Pros:  Location, Ambiance, Food is Decent.  Cons: Service.  The bar took a while to make and deliver drinks. The waitress got two of our orders wrong.  One of the burgers was well done when the person in our party ordered medium rare and my order was completely wrong.  The waitress brought me a calzone and I ordered Gluten-Free Pizza.   Under most circumstances I would have just went with it, but gluten makes me miserably ill and I had been very specific. I had to wait 25 minutes for my actual order and by then my party was done eating.  I wound up asking for my order to be boxed up. When we got the check, there were no apologizes and nothing was comped or offered. I worked in the service industry for 5 years and this was really just unacceptable.   I really want to love this new place and so I'll try it out in 3 months and hopefully their service will have improved dramatically.  But in the meantime, if you do try this place.... Set your expectations very low. Honestly, there are a lot of really great resturants in the area, so I recommend going somewhere else.  P.S.  It wasn't only our table with issues.

281,Marissa Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,20,,1.0,2012-11-11,"I was extremely disappointed in the customer service here. They do not take reservations, but they do take a one hour call-ahead. We had a large party (9 people) so we wanted to make sure to get our names in early. We discovered this when my friend called ahead two hours in advance. He was told to call back an hour before we were planning on arriving. When he did so and hour later, the employee on the other end told him that call-ahead was not allowed for parties of 6 or more, directly contradicting what the first employee had said. The employee remained certain of this policy even after numerous polite but incredulous questions about this policy. Despite the lack of call-ahead for our party, we decided to try anyway. When we arrived, the place was totally packed (it was a Friday night, so to be expected). To my dismay, the first thing I saw upon getting to the reception area was a sign that explicitly stated that parties of NINE or fewer could call ahead an hour! AAAAGH! So frustrating. I explained what had happened to the gentleman behind the desk. To make matters worse, the gentleman then gave us a condescending description of their call-ahead policy as stated on the placard I just read. I told him whoever talked to us on the phone was misinformed about the policy. He said the wait is an hour because we have *such a large party,* then offered to split us into multiple tables to reduce our wait time to 45 minutes. I asked if they could do anything for us, because we *did* call ahead, but the employee refused to take our name. The gentleman refused. He expectantly asked us again for our names, but I was so fed up I just walked out. This was not an appropriate response. A more convincing apology beyond ""sorry, there's nothing I could do"" would have been nice. Perhaps a promise to better educate the staff about their own policies. Because the call-ahead issue wasn't our fault (it was the bj's fault), other restaurants with sane customer service policies would bump a party up on the list to at the very least significantly reduce wait time. I have heard the the food here is good, so I'd be willing to try it again and amend my review. But until I get some sort of apology for the horrendous customer service, I will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=380,3.0440000000000005,3.0440000000000005,3.0440000000000005,3.0440000000000005,3.0440000000000005

MNF was playing and it was an hour + wait so we found a table around the bar area.   The server was polite and for the most part, attentive to our table.  All of the food we ordered did not come out at the same time...a couple of items were 10 mins behind the rest (we were a group of 5). I'm mainly giving this place a 3 Star because the BBQ Chicken Pizza (which is a staple for me) was not up to par.  Not only was the chicken was dry, but the BBQ sauce was too...is that possible?

Both the location and the interior were amazing.  It can't be better located on the busy Colorado Blvd. and the interior reminded me of a neo-classic banking institution.  It was very clean and ultra busy. While the food and service were good, I can't help but noticed a whole rash of servers in training...I mean they were everywhere!  They all gathered in one spot, which was very odd.  There were way many more servers than there were customers.  I sat at the main aisle and it was busy from the time I sat down to the time I left.  In fact I couldn't avoid being sideswiped even if I tried. I had the fish n' chips that night and although I really like the huge flaky pieces of white fish, the beer batter itself was pretty greasy and too much.  The batter almost distracted the taste of the fish itself.  The fries that came with the entree tasted frozen.   The service that night was just okay but I had trouble keeping track of who our main server was since different people arrived at the table bringing food, filling up water glasses, and bringing the bill.

Friend wanted to watch the UCLA/Stanford game here last night and was a bit reluctant to go.  Arrived slightly before kickoff and was in an empty section off to the side.  Was nice of them to allow me to pick the booth of my choice which was directly in front of a tv.  It wasn't long before the section filled up... Started off with a beer and waited for the rest to arrive.  Quickly finished the first pint and ordered a second as my friend was arriving. Ordered a few appetizers to start...stuffed mushrooms which were good and came out hot.  Avocado rolls...tasty and again were hot.  Buffalo wings were brought out dry and served with both ranch and the buffalo sauces on the side...a little weird but ok.  We quickly mowed through those and then ordered the nachos.  Though the cheese looked like it was melted, we found that the chili on the bottom to be cold.  Even the sour cream was so cold that it was icy!  The manager quickly rectified the issue and brought out another order which was awesome! Since UCLA lost that night, decided to drown my sorrows in a berry crumble.  I've had this at the Montebello location and thought that it was pretty good however, the crumble topping was actually salty and not sweet.  I normally would've complained but felt that since I had already complained about the nachos that I didn't want to risk them spitting in my food.  That was the only complaint that I had ... guess the chef was a little heavy on the dash of salt to enhance the taste of the berries.   Still new and definitely have improved since my last visit....hope they continue to improve as time goes by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=280,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.9920000000000004,3.6000000000000005

429,John E.,"Pasadena, CA",212,9,9.0,1.0,2012-12-26,"Bj's brewhouse is reminiscent of my college days: a pretty good deep dish pizza, awesome happy hour prices, decent beer on tap, and prompt, friendly service, but apparently these are all things of the past. I'm sad to have to write such a bad review at this location.  Brief run-down: Food Quality = barely mediocre Service = Inefficient and unsatisfactory; unfriendly hosts Ambiance = Great Location = inconvenient, but doable Now to the nitty gritty: HOSTESS/SEATING: My Friend Regina signs in for a table for 3 under ""Gina.' The good: we're seated in 15 mins on a Wednesday night at 8:15pm. The bad, the hostess calls out repeatedly, ""Jenna, party of 3."" After 2 attempts of Gina correcting the hostess, the hostess insists that she is waiting for a party of 3 for Jenna, NOT GINA...minutes later and after Regina clarifies with another one of the hostess, GINA party of 3 is finally seated.  TABLE/ORDER:  30 minutes after being seated, still no sign of a waiter/waitress. No on has come to check on our table or even provide water. Finally, we are able to flag down a waiter passing by, who graciously offered to take a drink order while he finds our waitress. Moments later, he lets us know he will actually be our server. (without having to say anything, clearly our waiter/waitress assigned to our section forgot about us). A few disappointing events to point out. It took 10 minutes for my beer to arrive after ordering, and probably would have been forgotten had we not asked another server passing by to check on our order.  1 out of 3 of the meals was served 15 minutes AFTER 2 of the entrees were brought out, that entree was a personal sized bbq chicken pizza that was served cold and dry. We went through the transition of 3 waiters in the 2 hour and 25 min time frame we were there, and really only waited on just shy one hour.  SPEAKING TO THE MANAGER: Typically, I have always had a great dining experience at several Bj's locations. This was my first time dining at the Pasadena location, and I was so excited to bring some friends from work here. Sadly, I was embarrassed to have suggested this establishment, seeing how we had such poor service.  I rarely ever make a complaint, but my friend felt that it was necessary we at least share our unsatisfactory dining experience with the manager. After a short 5 or so minute wait, we were approached by the manager, Eddie. I was curious to see how he would respond to the matter. We politely explained to him our disappointing and frustrating dining experience, from the point of check-in through paying the check. He listened with a seemingly attentive stance. We had already paid the bill, and he appreciated the feedback that we provided. He did, however, attempt to suggest that he would have comp'd a portion of the bill, but after finding out the bill had already been paid for, he made no other attempt to help rectify their poor service and cold food being served. He did make a suggestion that if when we come back, to approach him and he would take care of us...Let's get real here, IF i were ever to come back, would he even remember who I was or what had happened...realistically, no. Personally, I think how he should have addressed the matter, was maybe provide a voucher/gift card to facilitate a return visit and a hopeful chance at better service being provided...OR at the very least, offer a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience. Instead, a quick thank you and a speedily exit on his behalf. I hope this review makes it to the appropriate staff, or even Eddie, the manager, to help re-train and/or provide better, quality customer service.  Otherwise, Yard House is just a few feet away, customer service is WAAAAAY beyond better, the hostess and staff are incredibly friendly, AND has a much more palate, pleasing menu, along with a plethora of beer on tap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=460,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.052,3.5200000000000005

I was kind of taken aback in a good way. Too bad that was the only pleasant part of my visit here. Food: 2 Stars** 1) Great Beginnings - This would be a great appetizer for large parties had the food been hot. The spinach dip in the appetizer had the consistency of liquid cement as opposed to a warm dip. What a FAIL. The avocado egg rolls were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The cheese in the mozzarella sticks were more like string cheese than gooeym melted cheese. 2) Mediterranean Pizza - overly salty. 3) Jalapeno burger - I liked the overall flavor of the burger because of the spicy kick from the jalapenos, but the patty was soo overly cooked and dry that it ruined my appetite. It was like an equivalent to a dehydrated McDonalds patty. 4) Cajun Pasta - nothing special. It's definitely not worth the price or the calories.  You can find much better pasta elsewhere for similar or even cheaper prices. Service: 2 stars** I feel like the servers didn't want to check on us because we were a large party and it would've been a hassle for them to get refills for everyone. Parking: The parking sucks here. BJ's is not part of the Paseo, so if you park in the Paseo lot, you won't be able to get validation. You'll have to settle for parking elsewhere.

459,Laura M.,"South Pasadena, CA",9,52,2.0,1.0,2013-01-27,"I was so excited to take my family to a new place at The Paseo. We were seated right away for our Sunday lunch. Our waiter came and took our drink orders as soon as we sat down. But from then on, we had to remind him to bring us everything. My soup. Drink refills. Water. When our food came, the kids pizza was on the cold side. I went to cut into my ribeye steak, it was so tough I had to use all my strength to try and cut it. The waiter was there to see me do this. He said that if I wanted, he would bring me something else. Duh? What do you think?  I asked him to bring me the New York steak. He offered to bring me a salad while I waited.  After biting into my new steak, I realized I should not have ordered steak here. I've had better at Sizzler. The only good thing was that I promised the kids a pizzokie. I was glad they really loved it.  Overall, what really bothered me was the lack of interest from the manager in making sure we were happy with our meal. Usually when you send your entree back, a manager comes over to make sure you are happy with your replacement entree and offer to bring you dessert. I think the guy in collard shirt that brought me my new steak, who did not ask me, but told me that it looked better than the last one, was a manager. He dropped it off and literally ran away.  When the check came, the only thing that was comped was the sad salad that the waiter brought me. They even charged the us difference in steak price between the ribeye and the more expensive New York. How tacky is that?  Shame on you Bj's. Family time is very special. Instead of leaving your restaurant feeling happy to have spent a Sunday with my family. At a new place in a great space in town. Happy to have enjoyed a beer and the Lakers. I left with the feeling that I was ripped off. This place did not deserve my time or money. NEVER AGAIN.

293,Rob R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,22,,2.0,2013-02-03,"First of all, I love the BJs chain. I've gone to most of the nearby locations and have enjoyed myself every time. So naturally, when a BJs was opening in my town, I was eager to become a regular patron. Sadly, I don't think that will be happening anytime soon. I have been there about 4 times since they opened, and all four times, I swore I wouldn't go back.  Here's why: 1. Service has been pretty bad every time. It takes forever for servers to notice you, to check up on you, to bring your food, and to bring your check. The servers are nice and polite, but very slow and not very attentive. In one visit, I was at the bar and ordered a soda. It took about 10 minutes before I could get the bartender's attention to remind her that she never brought out my soda.  2. The food is not very good, or cooked correctly. I ordered a chicken Marsala, the chicken was great, the pasta was undercooked. The server offered to send it back, and I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to replace it. The pizza took way too long to come out (I was on my lunch break from work) and when it did, the cooks forgot to put BBQ sauce on my pizza. Since I didn't have time to wait for another meal to be cooked, I just asked for sauce in a cup, and poured it on top and ate it that way. Other food I have ordered has been cold, undercooked, or just incorrect as well. The last time I went, I just had drinks, because I didn't want to gamble on the food.  3. Parking. They do not validate, which is a big deal since Paseo costs $9.00 to park. Of course, when I ask about validation, the servers have suggested that I just go get validated at Gelsons or Macy's. maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but having an employee tell me to validate at another store without actually shopping there sounds pretty unprofessional to me. I like BJs, I really do, but this location is just poorly managed. It's too bad, because the location and the layout are amazing. They have the biggest TV I have ever seen in the bar, and the old building is gorgeous. But if I want to eat at BJs, I think I'll just trek down to Burbank or Monrovia instead of walking to this location.

Their well alcohol list is sub-par, especially when the otis bar at Le Grande Orange has tito's vodka and heradura tequila as well items.   Also, the bartenders are not engaging with the clientele. Another drawback is the parking, they do have valet parking in front but if you don't want valet service, then you are going to have to pay for parking.  Although bj's is within the paseo shopping complex, if you park at paseo, bj's will not validate your parking ticket and you will have to pay the full amount of parking and NOT 90 minutes free which is normal for the paseo.  On the plus side, the building is beautiful.   With so many great food and drink options in Pasadena, unless bj's raises the bar, they are going to lose out on the happy hour and lunch crowd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=500,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.2800000000000002,2.72

Worst restaurant experience in a long time.  I go out twice a week for dinner in Pasadena.  Pasadena has too many good restaurants that are always clean.   I will never go back to this restaurant and do not recommend anyone trying this place.  Don't waist your money or more importantly your precious time at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=520,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.212,2.6

We ordered appetizers and pizza to share. The appetizers were pretty good. But the deep dish pizza was terrible. It came out cold and the dough was soggy and felt a bit undercooked. At other BJ's, the pizza is served in the pan. For some reason, this one was served on a plate. I don't know what's wrong with their pizza chef, but he needs to fix this recipe quick!  Service was great until the very end. Throughout the meal, she came to check up on us quite frequently. But at the end when we needed some to-go boxes and the check, she was no where to be found. It took a while for us to even flag her down as she went MIA.  Overall, this would be a great place to grab drinks and food as you watch sports game if they improve on the taste of the food.

278,Rick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",357,81,63.0,3.0,2013-02-27,"Recently visited this location for lunch, during the week; I would imagine on the weekend and in the evening, it gets very busy. Parking is NOT validated by BJ's, as they are not part of the Paseo Colorado group, regardless of the fact that they are physically IN the complex, but whatever. Helpful tip: If you go around the corner to Gelson's grocery store, they have a self validation machine near the entrance; problem solved; not sure what the deal is with BJ's not being a part of the whole thing. During lunch (late lunch), the place was really empty, which is what I prefer, since BJ's in general tends to get really loud and douchey at night or when a sports event is on. No thanks; I like to be able to hear my meal conversations! I had a salad (and have had tons of other items at other BJ's locations), and the quality was just as I've come to expect from this chain - solid and tasty. No complaints from me food-wise. The service was a tad slow and toward the end of our lunch, our waiter was pretty much non-existent; maybe he fell asleep somewhere waiting for more customers to show up. That was annoying, but when he DID come to the table, he was pleasant. Not sure what the building originally was, but the interior of this location is much different than other BJ's. It must have been a bank or old hotel lobby or something - uber-vaulted ceiling and architecture definitely NOT the norm for this restaurant chain. We liked it, and likely will return again, as BJ's is always a decent go-to.

I ordered a root beer, a half turkey Cobb sandwich and a tomato soup. There was a couple at the bar also. The runner brought them their half sandwich orders.  A few minutes later, another runner brought three tomato soups out to the couple and me. (I always thought that soup should come out before the sandwich...no concept of timing). To our surprise the soup was totally cold. We complained to the bartender (short Hispanic girl who was nice and apologetic) and she took the couple's two soups back to the kitchen to tell the manager.  A short time later, a runner who was dressed as if he were the assistant manager (male Caucasian, 6-0, chubby, black hair) brought out my sandwich. I told him about my cold soup which was still sitting in front of me. He smugly told me that they were aware of the problem and were taking care of it. I asked him if he could take my soup away. He refused saying that the bartender would take care of it. The bartender had not returned from the kitchen and was not at the bar. I asked again and he argued with me that the bartender had a receptacle below the bar to put the bowl of soup away in. He had a poor, condescending attitude and I told him so. He then rudely and aggressively removed the bowl of soup making some smart alec comments. I then got up, told the manager that his runner was an asshole and left the restaurant. I have frequented the restaurant for lunch in the past and have never been treated so poorly.  FYI, ever since BJ's Pasadena opened, it has developed a reputation for poor service amongst the locals.

How does that work if you're there at late hours and Gelson's is closed? Lame. Because of this, we haven't been back in a while.

I figure it's best to let things settle for a while and let the hyperbole die down before the fingers hit the keyboard. But after my visit last night to BJs Pasadena, I simply could not wait!  My family and I (a group of about 10) ventured in here after my brother's graduation from Alhambra High. We've been to BJs plenty of times before at various locations so I wasn't really excited about this trip but was just stoked to get out of the sun and in to some pizookie!  I've been told by many friends that this location was formerly a bank and is ""really nice"". But I guess my friends are lacking in figurative language because this location is simply amazing! As you walk in, beautifully massive chandeliers greet you as you enter in to a restaurant that resembles something out of Chicago circa 1940. The ceilings are high and decorated in dark wooden squares accented with gold. The place is massive but doesn't feel cavernous and is overflowing with class. I couldn't help but walk around the dining room and gawk at everything as if I were in a museum. But enough about the setting. Let's get on to the food and service.  My mom called ahead to make sure we had a table when we arrived. As we walked in, we were immediately greeted and brought to our table. As soon as we all sat down, the manager came to say hello and offer a congrats to my little brother. Right away, everyone made us feel right at home. Our server, Marvina, then arrived and kept the great mood flowing. She was probably the friendliest and most up beat waitress I have ever met. After sitting in the sun for 4 hours, she was definitely the perfect person to rejuvenate our batteries and get us ready to feast.  Everyone pretty much knows the menu at BJs. You have your pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and a few other entree items that get you ready for the main prize of a pizookie at the end of the night. I had the Jambalaya which was very authentic and plentiful. A tad on the spicy side though, so beware. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food including my grandparents who are as picky as they come. At the end of the night, Marvina stuck around to make sure we all had a picture with the graduate. She indulged my mother who had her wait around as we fought about different poses and what not. But she was a great sport the entire time. My brother liked her so much, he asked if he could have a picture with her. Of course she obliged and helped put the lid on a pretty great night.  After visiting this BJs, I don't think I'll ever want to go to another location again. Thanks for the great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=340,2.6,2.6,2.6,3.3480000000000003,2.6

Now, BJ's has more on its menu than pizza and beer.  They have salads and pastas and flatbreads and appetizers (wings, bruschetta, etc.).  They also have a sports bar atmosphere.  Because we were searching for late night happy hour, we ended up at BJs.  Parking is either in the garage below or street parking (we found a spot on the street nearby, probably because it was so late and on a Sunday). Everything we ordered was off of the happy-hour menu -- featuring ""happy hour-sized"" food.  Wings, deep dish pizza, spinach and artichoke dip, and sliders.  Everything tasted great and was exactly what we were hoping for.  The beer is cold and the wine is good (and cheap.... $6 for a glass of La Crema Pinot Noir).  The service was also friendly and fast.

The bartender gal reminded us it was happy hour, we got a few beers, and then after she got us our beers, we then ordered some happy hour food. However, she then came back right after we ordered food and told us that happy hour ended just a minute ago. I told the bartender gal that we were waiting for over 20 minutes and that we came specifically for the happy hour and it was because no one helped us that we couldn't order the happy hour items in time.  She talked to her manager (some Hispanic lady) and told us that the manager was willing to charge our beers at the happy hour price but we'd have to pay for the happy hour food at full price. What the heck!? We paid for our drinks at left. Totally sucks, especially because the manager lady passed by our table twice. I made eye contact with her as well, but she didn't even help us!

273,Elizabeth U.,"South Pasadena, CA",113,19,3.0,1.0,2014-02-19,"So this is going to be lengthy, but I have to say something. I made a reservation here for my birthday last week for a party of 16, Sunday night at 6 o'clock. I was really excited to try BJ's for the first time because I had heard so many great things, but unfortunately my visit wasn't as great as others'.  Let me just start by saying that the location is great, and the restaurant itself is beautiful, and designed very well. There is a great selection of beers on the menu also, but the service is a complete and utter disaster.  Our server was very nice at first, and took all of our orders accordingly, however, for some of the orders he didn't write a single word down. We waited about twenty minutes before getting our drinks, but that's not even where it gets bad.  A single food runner comes waking around with a burger that has NOTHING on it. Just a patty between two buns and starts going person to person asking who ordered it. Shocking, no one ordered that. So she goes back. She comes back two minutes later with the same burger, and again, goes person to person asking who ordered that same burger. Again, no one claimed it. So at this point it had breached half an hour and no one had gotten their food yet. The restaurant wasn't even that packed, so why was the food taking so long to begin with? So finally, our food starts to come out, however, the food is coming out one single order at a time. So basically, another 20 minutes goes by before only three people have their food at the table. As if this night couldn't get any worse, all of our orders went back to the kitchen at least three times because they were all wrong. Need I remind you, we are not a very tough crowd to please. Fries were cold, burgers were made wrong, burgers came out without lettuce on them, and meat wasn't cooked right. The meat was either way too raw, or completely burnt to crisp. So finally after we had complained a few times, the manager came to visit our table. He was very nice, and very understanding, but he didn't do much to mend the fact that my birthday dinner has now gone to total crap. Everyone was completely unhappy. I felt the worst for my brother. He ordered a burger, and on the picture it showed bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce and meat. It looked like a pretty good burger. However, when he finally got his burger, it had absolutely nothing on it. Not even lettuce. And the manager proceeded to ask him if he asked for lettuce on the burger in the first place. On the description it even says it comes with lettuce! Are you kidding me?! So my brother points out the picture and says, ""I'm sorry, I thought I ordered that burger."" The manager then tells him that the burger isn't properly shown in the picture. That he would have to ask for all the extras on the burger in the first place. So eventually, my brother just sucked it up and ate his completely bland and burnt burger.  At the end of the night the manager did say that all the burgers that were returned to the kitchen were going to be on him. Coincidentally, that was more than half the burgers that were ordered that night. He also gave us all a coupon for a free Pizookie anytime we wanted to return to any other BJ's. I highly doubt that any of us will return again.  In summation, and without exaggeration, this probably had to be the worst dinner and the worst service that I have ever had in my life. Most of us didn't even finish our food, and we didn't ask for boxes to take home either. I really wish that my first experience was better, and I wish that it hadn't been on my birthday.

My personal crazy aside, the diet menu is OK- especially if you like salmon, which I don't. They've got lots of other choices too. I got the fish tacos and let's just say I would never submit myself to that punishment again. Just. gross, mostly flavorless and a few chips are not a side. Also because I order off the diet menu, I have convinced myself that this entitles me to an appetizer: the ahi poke, corn fritters, and the avocado egg rolls are all really good.

447,Shannon A.,"Laramie, WY",0,11,,2.0,2014-05-22,"I went to BJ's while attending a conference in Pasadena. I was looking forward to trying some of their beer given the statements of award winning, etc. For the positives, I felt the service was good. My server was attentive and she tried to describe food and beer pairings. The food was average. I had a buffalo burger with jalapenos and pepperjack cheese. It was good, but not great (i.e. typical pub good). The reason for my two-star rating is because of the beer. I am a person who enjoys craft beer and in my opinion I felt that each beer was muted in flavor and most lacked body. The Kolsch was passable but lacked the saaz hop flavor I was expecting. The red ale lacked both hop bitterness and caramel one would expect from a red. The IPA didn't have much hop flavor in the nose and certainly didn't have the citrus or piney flavors of American hops. There was another Irish red that had some decent flavor with a hint of caramel from the malt. Thus was the best beer I tried during this visit. Frustrated by my flight of 4 beers, decided to give the porter a try. This beer is classified incorrectly as it resembles a brown ale, not a roasty porter. The color was also too light. If they called this a brown ale I would have a better opinion of this particular beer. As a beer lover, I cannot recommend drinking BJ's beers with so many other fantastic options out there.

The only reason why it's getting two stars is because the architecture is beautiful inside. But when it comes to the food...oh man. The foodie part of my heart breaks.  After being distracted by the cool-looking ceiling, my husband and I decide to order the calamari for an appetizer. For the main course, he orders the black and blue burger and I order the Cajun shrimp pasta. The calamari came pretty quick, but once you take a bite you realize why: they probably grabbed the last batch that was at the bottom of the frozen bag of calamari and then they popped it in the microwave. That is pretty much how it tasted. I was starving so I didn't really care, but my husband was disappointed that there wasn't really a crunch to those little critters. Our server offered to take it back, but I refused because I thought it was ok enough to eat...and maybe part of me didn't want spit in my next entrée.  The burger and the pasta came. First look at my pasta and I thought, ""wow. They doused a lot of the sauce on it."" I took a bite and the pasta reminded me of those times when I would be boiling pasta myself and I would taste-test it to see if it was ready but it wasn't so I would let it boil for a little longer. Well...the cook didn't seem to let it boil for a little longer and ended up serving me with undercooked pasta. The bread was good so I munched on that. The shrimp was ok, too. When my husband saw how little I ate, he tasted some of my pasta to see how undercooked it was and he agreed. He told our server and our server went to ask her manager if she could have it taken off our tab. We were glad they did because that would be very upsetting if we paid for undercooked pasta that I took two bites out of.  So...to finish up this very sad tale of our dinner at BJ's: we will not come back to this one again.

This is the slowest BJ's I have ever been to. The wait time wasn't so bad considering it's a Saturday night - only five minutes. The food took forever to come out, and the pizookies took 45 minutes to come out. 45 MINUTES?! I think they milked a cow, then churned the ice cream in the back. When they did finally come out, the pizookies were ice cold.  The food is always delicious, but one of our plates came out with no fries. We were told they would be out when they were ready. About 15 minutes later out waiter brought out an old plate of wedges that looked like they came from another persons plate. When we got the check, we still hadn't gotten our fries. When we mentioned it to the waiter, he LAUGHED it off as if it wasn't a big deal.  One last thing - the waiter spilled hot sauce all over our table, when he was taking one of our plates back. Terrible. Sad to say this is the worst experience I've had at a BJ's. I will definitely not come back to this location.

509,Carrie D.,"Pasadena, CA",1501,416,2.0,1.0,2014-08-29,"Speed of service and proper training of staff matters...and really, these are two of the most basic elements of running a good restaurant. This BJ's cannot even meet the basic minimum standards of customer service. Stopped in for lunch today because I had gotten several emails from BJ's alerting me to the fact they currently had the ""Party for 2"" special. This is a great deal, especially since they have a gluten free version. My partner-in-crime Brian V. and I decided to take advantage of the offer and have lunch there today...I deeply regret this decision. When our server Christobal arrived to take our order (and it took him quite a while to actually arrive to take our order) he was completely clueless as to the fact there was a ""Party of 2"" special. I received 5 different emails from BJ's and it is featured on their website, yet a server in their restaurant had no idea what the special was, or that it even existed at all. We showed him the BJ's website on our phone, but he had to go and check with the manager...oh surprise, there is indeed a ""Party of 2"" special. We ordered two waters, a bowl of clam chowder, a wedge salad, and a gluten free pizza with mushrooms, tomatoes, green peppers, and olives. A few minutes later Christobal arrived with plates for our pizza...but no drinks. I asked about the water and got the response, ""Oh...yeah...it's coming..."" A few minutes later our soup and salad arrived (delivered by a food runner)...and then...finally...we got our water. We finished our starters...and waited...and waited...and eventually our pizza arrived...without tomatoes. I pointed out to Christobal that our pizza was missing the tomatoes we ordered. He took out his order pad/whatever he wrote our order on and said, "".oh yeah."" He took our pizza back to the kitchen...and again we waited. He showed up a while later with our pizza...and it had tomatoes on it...but they were, raw, cold, wet, tomatoes that had simply been thrown on top of our cooked pizza. When I told Christobal that this was not acceptable he seemed confused...""You wanted tomatoes on you pizza right?"" MY answer was, ""yes, but I wanted them to actually be cooked on to the pizza like all of the other toppings."" He took the pizza away. He came back and told us the manager was going to bring us our pizza...and we waited...and waited...and waited some more. Eventually a female manager (do not know her name because she did not introduce herself) brought our pizza back to us...I say ""back"" because it was the original tomato-less pizza with tomatoes and more cheese sprinkled on it that had been shoved under the salamander to kind of, sort of, not really melt the cheese. I was actually speechless at this point...really, how is any of this a good solution? Raw tomatoes...that is just stupid...but to bring a re-fired, mess of a pizza back to an already aggravated customer is the height of bad customer service.  The ""Party for 2"" comes with a pizookie...we got the gluten free one...it was fine. But, we had to wait forever and a day to get the check from our server. And then, to add insult to injury, I wanted to use some of my rewards points (accumulated at many other BJ's...not this one) which would give us $10 off the meal. After waiting...again...a long time...Christobal arrives and tells us that the manager is working on our check, but because we got the ""Party for 2"" I may not be able to use my coupon. Coupon, what coupon? These are rewards points that BJ's gives me for being a loyal customer. He just looked at me with apathy, disinterest, and confusion.  I told him we needed the check right now...we needed to leave...just bring the check. OMG,...waiting...waiting...finally Christobal arrives with the check and tells us that they were indeed able to apply my rewards points. This was seriously one of the single worst customer service experiences I have ever had, anywhere. A person who had just wakled off the street could have been a more informed and capable server than Christobal. I would assume that BJ's has a training program for managers and servers...perhaps our server was just absent that say. And clearly the manager was absent that day too. Seriously, do yourself a favor...go to one of the other fine eating establishments in Pasadena.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=340,2.6,2.95,2.95,2.148,2.8100000000000005

The server mixed up my girlfriend's drink, and had to ask for confirmation a minute or two after trying to memorize my order. As for the food, I ordered pizza after being pleasantly surprised in Arcadia. This pie, though (a small deep dish pepperoni pizza), was seriously lacking in sauce.

Although the portions are not as big as a regular entrée, I must say that it's still pretty darn big for me. Ordered a club sandwich combo around $7.00 something-  which comes with your choice of their soups- I chose clam chowder. The club sandwich came out with a side of frites as well, pretty good! The sandwich itself was good, you really can't go wrong ordering a club sandwich - bacon and avocado just makes everything yum. However, the clam chowder itself was super duper salty. I had to drink a big gulp of water every time I take a sip of that chowder. Not good.  Friend of mine ordered the ""shrimp scampi pasta with clam chowder (in a bread bowl)."" Although it's lunch portion on the lunch menu, it was still a very big portion - this combo is around $16.00. My friend literally just finished her chowder bowl and only touched a bit of her pasta since all their portions were huge.  Other friend of mine ordered the unlimited soup & salad. It comes with unlimited salads with the choice of:  caesar salad, wedge salad or fresh mozzarella and tomato salad.  My friend chose the Caesar salad and it's a good portion every time they serve it to her. It's unlimited, you can't go wrong with eating salad when there's a few choices to choose from every time.  For appetizer - we ordered the ""Ahi-Poke."" The Ahi-Poke with avocado was a good combo along with the crunchy wonton chips. I thought the Poke was fresh, so that was good. Too bad the Ahi- Poke came out after our meal, not so much of an appetizer for us afterall.  Overall, the food was great but I thought the waiting time was a bit too long. Either because my friends and I were on an one hour lunch break - which cuts it really close to have lunch at restaurant or their service is just slow. I felt like the service was just slow but maybe others had a better experience here when they had lunch.  The ambience and anterior was great.

We did have to ask the manager to turn up the volume for the big game but that was taken care of with no problems. There seemed to be a high ratio of Bruins to Trojans but maybe that's because the Trojans got quieter and quieter as the game progressed and started sneaking out in their own version of the walk of shame? No hipsters. Yay.  5/5: Alcohol. A nice draft beer for $5.25? Sounds good to me. Seems like they have lots of your standard ""brewhouse"" options.  3/5: Dining. The menu options here offer nothing to write home about. The best thing I had turned out to be the Ghiradelli chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. My friends seemed to enjoy their pizza.  5/5: Service. Our server Marvina did an outstanding job of taking all of our orders, keeping them all straight (there were six of us), and took really good care of us.  4/5: Parking. Parking meters are free after 5 pm a couple of blocks away (near City Hall).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=100,2.68,2.77,2.77,2.6399999999999997,2.734

Boyfriend and I arrived here after a long, long day (and a long drive) and we were starving for some food. I hadn't been to BJ's in awhile, so we decided on them. We came in at about 9:50pm on a Friday night--surprisingly, they were not that busy. We were immediately seated at a nice, comfy booth. Our server came a few minutes later, and took our order. So far, so good. Our house salads came out first. They were alright; nothing fancy or special--nothing I wouldn't be able to make by myself at home. However, given the fact I was starving, I was glad to have any kind of food in my stomach. We waited about five minutes for this to come out--a reasonable amount of time. Then, everything went downhill from there. We waited for our food for FIFTY MINUTES. FIFTY. FRIGGIN. MINUTES. No explanation was offered. Our server was nowhere to be found. No apologies were given until our food finally arrived--and it arrived right on cue, because we were ready to get up and leave. As a sort of lukewarm apology, BJ's offered us free dessert for making us wait the entire time. We ended up not taking the dessert because we don't eat dessert. I felt so bad for our server because our wait wasn't necessarily her fault; what I thought was completely unacceptable was the fact that NOT ONCE did we ever get an apology from the manager. He or she never came out to talk to us to make sure that we were okay. He or she never apologized for making us wait for nearly an hour. Meanwhile, the rest of the staff was standing around, talking to each other, and not tending to their tables. I even saw one girl texting. Omg. Texting? When the table you're in charge of is waiting for your service? -__- Brownie points, though, to the hostess, who saw that boyfriend and I were distressed and tried to find our server.

So if you're into architecture then you are sure to enjoy a meal here. We were in an old 1924 Bank building. The columns took my breath away. We shared two appetizer platters, two Caesar salads and one of the signature deep-dish pizzas they're known for.  My son chose the BBQ chicken pizza.  My husband enjoyed the 152"" plasma TV along with his award-winning crafted adult beverage.  They were busy so the service was a bit delayed. They tried their best to make us feel as if we were their only customers. I do have to say my favorite was the dessert. My girls devoured their Chocolate Chip Pizookie topped with vanilla ice cream and we shared the Salted Caramel Pizookie.  AMAZING! If you're into a little sweet and a little salty. It's made with caramel cookie dough, almond toffee, pretzel bites and white and dark chocolate chips. Can't forget the vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate.

We sat for 10 minutes before being greeted by our waitress (Judy A)  and another 10 minutes before she came back  to take our drink orders. Things quickly went down from there. My black cup of coffee arrived with bright red lipstick on the rim and it took another server another 15 minutes before I received another cup, sans the red lipstick! We waitied another lengthly time to place our order and even longer to receive our food. The food arrived cold. Our waitress was not at all attentive, we constantly had to flag her down for refills, boxes and to order dessert for the kids and even the bill. The entire experience was not enjoyable at all. I'm not one to complain, but this was really bad. I called to restaurant directly to speak with the manager, the phone rang and rang... I called back using automated option to reserve for a large party. WOW! some one actually answered the phone. A women by the name of Kathleen or Karen came to phone. We talked about our visit to her restaurant and as all managers do she apologized and offered a certificate for a return visit. I told her my intention for the call was not to receive a gift card/ certificate but to inform her of the staffs' lack of customer service. She insisted on sending me a gift card/ certificate, she jotted down my email address to send immediately. Needless to say, I never received any email from BJ""s or the manager with a formal apology or gift card.

Love the fact that they brew their own beer. However on this particular visit, I was beyond disappointed. after waiting for nearly 20 minutes for a table, the server was quick with the drink orders and we ordered a kids meal right away and also calamari.  The calamari was over cooked, rubbery, and really still dripping in grease and very much clumped together. Kids corn dog bites weren't horrible....but definitely frozen from a box...I kind of expected different. After seeing our waitress walk by several times I finally asked for some small bread plates for us to share the calamari......and clearly, with empty soda glasses on our table I kinda expected to get refills.....but I finally had to ask for refills. which were quickly brought.  Our waitress never checked on our satisfaction of the calamari, or the kids meal. we finished the app and stacked the dishes on the large plate and put it on the edge of the table.  After about 20 minutes...seriously 20 minutes.....I made eye contact with the waitress, who I hadn't talked to since the soda refills, who came over and asked if everything was OK. I told her that our party of 3 were still waiting on entrees. She said ""oh they'll be out soon"". meanwhile the 6top next to us had gotten there after us and got their food first. That's unacceptable. So..after being seated for nearly an hour...I see our food being taken out of the kitchen......to the wrong table. Well....with a fussy 2 year old AND a new baby, and a long wait for lackluster food and just below mediocre service, I requested to-go boxes and the check. I don't usually, but this time I had to notify the manager. He was accommodating and understanding. He comped our entrees. That was nice. but I expected that after the experience we just had. will we go back.......probably in a few months after this bad taste leaves my mouth, because microwaved ribs and soggy fries are not eat I wanted to eat tonight.....and as we walked out, the calamari plate was still sitting on the table and not a single thing had been bussed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=440,2.68,2.66,2.66,2.2800000000000002,2.668

But the last few times we have been here the service has been TERRIBLE! Clueless waitresses who have small sections and can't remember what our orders are and what we asked for. Today, it took our server 20 minutes to tend to us, after tending to two other tables that were sat in our section after us. After she asked us for our drink order, she was going to give us even more time to look over the menu. She wasn't ready for us to give her our order. Once the drinks came, she brought us the wrong drinks and we got our first refill after dinner was over. One of us never even got a refill on an iced tea.  One of us got a burger, didn't ask for bacon and bacon was on her burger. She also asked if the burger had a sauce, the waitress was positive there was- there was no sauce. we also had to ask a different server for condiments. This was better compared to our precious visit but not by much!  Our previous visit, the same instance happened where our server took more than 15 minutes to tend to us.  We ordered fish and chips and the Brewhouse nachos (not on the menu anymore but they still make it). The fish and chips were horribly over breaded and it took three visits from our server to finally bring the malt vinegar we asked when we first ordered. When I asked for the Brewhouse nachos, I asked her what came on it, she said ""I don't know because it's not on the menu,"" I asked her if she could get a list for me and she rolled her eyes at me. Then when I asked if I could give her a list of what I didn't want she sighed. I simply just asked for no jalapeños and dealt with picking everything off by hand.

There are other pizza places in old pasadena with excellent service and great pizzas. If you are wanting good service and good pizza, then try one of them or a different BJ's.

We sat towards the back of the restaurant and after waiting 10-15 to even get acknowledged, I figured out the waiter (who seemed overwhelmed and over his head) had about 12 tables to tend to by himself. So I spent the rest of the time there convincing myself that it was not his (Nicholas) fault and it was the management that didn't care about customers. 1) ordered drinks and appetizers and kids food. 2) Appetizers showed up, but we had no plates or forks/ napkins 3) asked for them, and he apologized and said he would get them right away. 4) Kids meals showed up 5-10 minutes later, but we still had no napkins/ forks. More apologies. 5) Finally done eating, he asked if we wanted anything else and I ordered a Pizooki that the kids had been looking forward to since we got there. 6) 15 minutes later, he walked up to our table with our check. I asked about the Pizooki, and he seemed baffled and surprised that we had not received it yet. 7) After checking the register, he apologized and said it was never ordered. Since it was past kids bed time, we asked him not to bother and paid and left. I think there was one more apology! I looked on the receipt to see if I could take a survey or something about our experience, but they are smart enough not to give you that option!!

The dine in service is terrible and It is practically impossible to order food to-go, pay by phone and pick up your order seamlessly.  I work in the office building upstairs from this location so one would think that it would be very easy and convenient ordering from here.  Today I ordered a cup of soup at 2:10pm, paid with an app on my phone, showed up at 2:35pm.  The only guy in the front area was on the phone and after a very long conversation, he asked if I had been helped.  Who would have helped me?  We have both been standing here together through your conversation and no one else is here!  Then he left and sent someone else over who also left to find my food.  Then a different person came to help (without my food) but couldn't find my order.  Then he left and got someone else to help and neither of them could find my order. Finally a BJ's server that was dressed in plain clothes listening to another BJ's server that appeared to be on break complaining about her personal problems finally taught both of them how to pull up a to-go order.  While I was grateful to him for finally helping, I thought it was rude that the two of them took up the whole bench, which was the only space for me to sit while I waited through the whole circus of how many people it takes to get one person a cup of tortilla soup.  THEN FINALLY one of them left to actually go and get the soup from the kitchen, so I waited for that for a while.  When the guy with my soup started talking to another guest and fumbling with my bag I just grabbed my cup of soup, asked for a spoon and stormed out, not that anyone cared or noticed how ridiculous the whole thing was. If I hadn't already paid I would have left long ago. This is not the first time I've been through this fiasco. I've complained twice before about pick up orders (time wasted, forgotten pieces of my meal) but no one cares.  I suspect the GM gets a lot of complaints and is completely burnt out.  Until then I guess I'll just go if I'm desperate, haven't had the opportunity to roll my eyes lately or feel like being treated poorly when I have extra time on my hands with nothing to do.  Until then!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=320,2.36,2.53,2.844,2.248,2.4619999999999997

I sent it back and told my waiter I'll take the fries instead because that was absolutely gross. He apologized and took it back. He then brought out cold fries.

When our salads came out - mine was actually entered in wrong. While I waited another 20 min for a salad, I watched in complete hunger at everyone else with their food around me. Once my salad arrived, the pizza came within a few minutes - leaving me with a bunch of plates and little to no space for anything else.

I did get my parking validated. Maybe it was the weekend? But I just wanted to say that. I'm not sure if it's just BJ's all around but when I go to BJ's I feel their service is not that great. This was my first time at the Pasadena location and the service was not that great. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday around 11:15am for a paint nite event at 12:30p. We were seated away from other diners, around the corner in the very far back corner. I'm not sure what was the reasoning behind them sitting us there but we happened to get seated right across the paint nite event and watched them set up.  Our server seemed unsure of herself. She gave off a vibe like she was confused or awkward. That made me feel awkward around her. I felt when she checked on us, she would watch from a distance and just stare at us. Then when she would finally come on over to check on us, she would linger too long or have a weird facial expression.  Anyways, when it came time to pay the bill, she devoted her attention to helping the paint nite people set up. Reminder, we were across the paint nite event I was trying to flag her down so she can take the check.  The food was meh. Surprisingly the food tasted better at other BJ's locations.

They had a long and nice bar with a huuuuge flat screen t.v behind it and multiple flat screens throughout the establishment. It is a great place to eat and watch a game or two! The food was good but nothing could be considered scrumptious except of course THE PAZOOKIE which was absolutely scrumptious and melt in your mouth delectable one of a kind treat! I had requested from the get go to get my pazookie first and had to ask 2 more times before the waiter told me there was a mix up and it wasn't even put in the oven yet, by that time I had already recieved my pizza, so I told him to not worry and have it come out later. I was disappointed as I am one of the few fairy people that enjoy their deserts first=) The avocado eggrolls were yummy as well as their ranch and veggie pizza. I ordered roasted garlic in addition to my toppings and it was scrump, but they could have put a lot more. The server was nice even though the food was not served in a timely manner even though the restaurant was not packed by all means.

I've had a number of waiter's I wasn't necessarily happy with.  Every time I come here to grab drinks they throw me a little attitude when asking to see my ID.  I understand that they need to verify my age, but there's a polite way to do so.   There is a line between being friendly and coming off as rude and I've had multiple waiters here cross that line. The food is alright.  I usually build a pizza or try a pasta.  Last week we tried their new Siracha Chicken Bacon Mac n Cheese.  Do not recommend it.  Note that the pasta used is penne, not macaroni.  The cheese sauce used tasted almost like nacho cheese and made it difficult to eat.  I like their Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad.  That's probably my go-to and I hate ordering salads at restaurants, but this is a pretty filling salad even between two people. Not too heavy and also a little refreshing. Pizookies are always to die for! I've never had a bad experience with pizookies. Last time a waiter was kind enough to help us sample a couple of their brews to help us decide what to drink.  I like light beers and recommend their Brewhouse Blonde or their Piranha Pale Ale. For those into darker brews, go for the Nutty Brewnette or Jeremiah Red.  Or for those just looking for something sweet to drink try the Berry Burst Cider!  I usually love going to BJs with a group of friends, but I really do not recommend this location.  Though this is also the slowest location I've been to so far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=140,2.32,2.48,2.664,2.02,2.416

We stopped by for a quick bite and drinks to end a hard day. We'd ordered a BJ's Classic Combo Pizza and Crispy Honey Chicken Salad. The pizza was primarily thick dough with minimal cheese, sausage, pepperoni et al. What was more deflating is that this picture of the pizza was 1/2 the thickness as shown on the menu. The Crispy  Chicken Salad - the chicken tenders were very overdone; if you want real crispy, hard chicken tenders - this is the salad you should order.  The last time we were there we'd ordered BJ's flatbread Margherita Fresca, but when it arrived it was missing the shredded basil. Once we informed the waitress it took almost ten minutes to get the basil and the flatbread was cold.

58,Annie L.,"Cerritos, CA",3,88,127.0,4.0,2016-01-16,"I normally wouldn't write a review for a major chain restaurant, but the customer service I experienced compels me to recognize their good work. But first, the mandatory food review. I haven't been to a BJ's in a few years. I liked their food overall, but I had not been back since they revised their menu to the current one. So everything but the pizza and pizookies seemed new to me. I ordered a sandwich and shared 2 appetizers with my friend. Here is the breakdown: Chicken Pesto Sandwich: Comes with a salad that could have been a little crisper, but the dressing was light and tasty. The sandwich was more of a melt. Hot and cheesy (sounds like the perfect man). The chicken itself wasn't my favorite. Seemed over-salted and a little dry. My fix to that was dipping the sandwich in ranch dressing. Hehe...what? It worked!  Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts: Get it. Just do it. They're good. Don't argue with me. Order them. Note: they come in more quantity than in the picture. Maybe the brussel sprouts in the pictures are ginormous.  Guacamole and Chips: I took a leap of faith and hoped the guac and chips would be tasty...and I regret doing that. Yes, the guacamole was made of real avocados. But the portion was small. We ran out of guac before the chips were finished :( And I was eating it kind of sparingly.  Now on to the reason I started writing this review. I had a little bit of a mishap with my food that resulted in me asking for a refund. They were more than willing to do so. AND they also comped our Party Pizookie. I don't even get treated this well on my birthday! Thank you BJ's Pasadena! Parking is underground or street. Underground parking gets 90 minutes validation at a self-serve machine near the entrance to the underground lot. BJ's themselves doesn't offer validation.

There was one seat left at the bar with barely enough room to extend your elbows without impinging on ur fellow diners turf.

Is it really that big a deal to spread diners out through the entire dining area and give everyone some comfortable personal space.

After each order, however, rather than fulfilling it, the results were nowhere to be seen -- literally lost. Little did we know. So we ordered a drink while we waited. Twice. We ordered dinner. Twice. Given it was a busy time, we thought, ok, it does take time. An hour later:  no soups, no salads, no dinner. Waiter returns, seeming completely disoriented as to why we have no food. Returns to kitchen. Sometime later, returns. More investigations. Order lost. Basically, if we had not asked, it wa s never coming. Apologies ensue; manager appears, offers to pay for some of our food.  We were friendly and understanding throughout. 30 minutes or so later, dinner arrives, 1.5 hours into this. So they had a problem, and apparently they are going to prove to us how great they are. Let's have some dessert. Change of waiter. New waiter knows nothing of our order. 30 minutes later, no dessert. Criminy, its a single scoop of ice cream and a single cookie.  We are friendly and understanding. We joke to the new waiter that we are thinking of ordering some dessert. Another 10-15 minutes later, dessert arrives.  The bill arrives, and there is partial coverage, not what we understood was to be provided that the manager had noted.  We pay the balance and leave.

The high & back lit ceiling make for a dramatic setting for a meal and definitely the nicest space I've ever dined at that housed a BJ's. We went there on a Thursday evening. Parked downstairs in Paseo Colorado underground parking. We tried to park on the end just under where the restaurant would be and took the elevators up. But to get to the restaurant from that way, you have to walk through an alley that passes the trash bins of the restaurant so you may wanna hold your breath or go another way as it isnt the most scenic of routes. We only saw one entrance and its along Colorado. We started off with one of their thin crust tavern pizzas ($11.50). We went with the italian market which had meatballs, pepperoni, ham and peperoncinis. It was quite tasty. I prefer the thin crust when I want to sample other things on the menu. The deep dish is so heavy & filling. The toppings all tasted great and normally I dont eat peppers but the peperoncinis really tasted great on this thin crust pizza.  We also got the cheese bread for my nieces and it was just ok. The crispy calamari ($11.50) was good with its fresh taste. The breading was light and gave great texture and the squid itself was tender. The accompanying marinara dipping sauce was good... The fresh atlantic salmon ($18.95) was good. I liked it a lot. The blackened salmon with lemon butter sauce over rice pilaf was really good. I was surprised. The salmon wasnt dry and it tasted great. The vegetables on the side were whatever. For desert we ordered a pizookie trio ($10.75) which were 3 mini pizookies meant to be shared. We went with OG chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia and cookies and cream. Yummm... They were all great. ALL OF THEM. It was my first time trying the cookies and cream. It was like eating a warm oreo cookie. Soo good.  Service could have been better. We stood there a little while waiting to be seated and the place wasnt packed at all. The hostess was away from the front of the restaurant. We were sat in a big u-shaped booth. We had 3 adults and 2 children... We had to wait for utensils to be provided and our food had started making its way to our table already. So that was a bit of an inconvenience. Also, we waited awhile (again) for the waitress to refill our drinks... By then, the lack of customer service was annoying. Anddd... When we wanted to pay the bill, we had to ask another server to find OUR server so she could ready the check. ANDD... when we wanted to pay the bill (in cash), I couldnt find her again and we certainly didnt want to leave cash on the table so I had to search for some staff member, ANY staff member and I found a hostess...

As a vegan, I usually avoid chains at all cost, but they were giving free meals to veterans (and I am one) and I read that their pizzas are vegan (if you take off the cheese). so my fiancé and I turned it into a Friday date night. Beware, the parking is awful. They don't have their own lot, so unless you find street parking, you're doomed to try to find parking in Paseo Colorado. By the time we got to the restaurant, the wait was about 50 minutes. For 7:00pm on a Friday, I guess that's normal... (again I never go to chain restaurants). We waited at the bar, over an hour later we decided to see what was up. They had given away our seats to someone else at the bar and pretended like they ""missed"" us.  Over an hour later, we finally sat down and ordered some drinks, chips and guac to start. I also showed them my military ID so that we'd get $5 drinks and a free meal for me. We waited about 40 minutes for our pizzas to come out! And the chips and guac never came (only after we said ""hey, our entrees are out and we never got our apps""). The pizza was good.  I liked the dough very much and was happy I wasn't forced to get a salad and fries. The guac was good as well. That is the only reason this place is getting 2 stars from me. Because, for a chain, the food was decent.  Onto the bill... after already showing them ny military ID (for Veterans day specials) they didn't take off our discount. So we had to find the waitress to take it off. Then, she didn't take off the drink specials for ($5 beers for veterans day). So we had to find her again. At that point was when she said, our beers didn't count because we didn't order the right ones.

I was scratching my head wondering why she needed to check with her manager before seating us.  I couldn't figure out why?  There was enough space for the 3 of us.  Anyhow, we were eventually seated.  Our server was very friendly, but unfortunately, his attention to detail was subpar.  He had forgotten a few things that we ordered and didn't come to check in on us on a periodic basis like how other great servers do.   The food was okay; nothing spectacular.  I order the prime rib which was very good, but the mashed potatoes was cold.  My wife ordered the ahi tuna salad. Again, not really that fresh.  I had better Ahi Tuna at the Yard House.  Overall, the experience was not that great.  What is also a deal breaker was their inability to validate our parking ticket.  If they can afford a super spacious former historic bank, they can subsidize our parking, too.   We are not going back to this location.  I will take a further drive out to Glendale, instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=60,2.6,2.57,2.56,2.184,2.582

We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip as Appetizer. The Dip was too cheesy for my taste. I can barely taste any of the veggies in there. Hardly any artichoke chunks were in there. I ordered the Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus Pasta for my entree. There was practically no flavor in there, where I had to add salt on my own. The shrimp does not look like what you see in the picture.

When the Deep Dish Baked Ziti was brought out, it looked small, didn't look like something I would pay full price for, but that's just me. Once I tried some of the Ziti, it made my disappointed face turn into a big smiley face. Probably one of the best pasta dishes at BJ's hands down. Flavors were on point, didn't taste too cheesy and the sausages really complemented the pasta well. The Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs was nothing special. The bread that this dishes came with was really impossible to split in half by cutting, but when you took a bite into it with some of the pasta, it tasted good. Service was good. Checked out their large flat screen TV which was pretty cool. Overall, would recommend coming here and getting the Deep Dish Baked Ziti if you got the BOGO coupon.

I M not going to complain about the consistently inconsistent service. As someone who has been here a half to a full dozen or more times. I am not bothered that my order is wrong EVERY time I order here.  I mean it makes sense that my appetizer comes after my dinner. My salad can once in a while miss ingredients or be a completely different salad. Those things happen. You serve me the wrong drinks? I'll laugh it off. But, to have something be completely and totally incorrect EVERY time I come here had to be an all time noteworthy description of ineptitude.  I'm talking epic consistency of messing up orders. Lactose intolerant? Cheese bread for you. Peanut allergies? Cashew chicken (exaggeration but you get the ideas!). I don't get it. Can't explain it. But, it's damn consistent that your order is going to be wrong, forgotten, or given to the people next to you.  I'm not complaining about the servers. They are nice and always apologetic. I'm not mad at the cooks for missing my orders. I'm not mad at the hostesses who try to sit 2 or 3 couples at the same table. I have decided this comprehensive a show had to be the top.  Management doesn't manage. Doesn't check on things. In fact they are uninvolved and basically apathetic.  Perfect example. Our appetizer was served after dinner. Seems simple. The server told his manager. She never came by to check on us to make sure the order got fixed. Never saw her/him follow-up. In fact, the SECOND time they forgot the appetizer it still wasn't fixed.  No my friends. This isn't a institutional problem it's a leadership problem. Small things are let to become big things. I've never seen such a disjointed chain restaurant in my life.  If the food weren't good (and it's pretty darn good) I would give terrible ratings. But you'll get a good meal. It's just you better have huge patience and the ability to laugh at horror shows.  On the bright side. Nice decor here too! Enjoy the show. Lol Update: Jan 2017 Been back a few times. Seems like they're getting the hint and working hard to get more staff.

Too bad the quality of the food is NOTHING like what you see or read about in the menu. Lets start out with the drinks. I ordered the Raspberry iced tea. It was more like Raspberry syrup with a splash of tea. It was so weak! We ordered the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. They were disgusting! Had an old taste to them, like they microwaved some old egg rolls that were made a day before...The ingredients inside were undetectable. Some kind of mashed up mess with a few visual hints of avocado. The dipping sauce made them somewhat edible. I ordered a dish (don't remember the name), shrimp with spinach and quinoa and tomatoes. It was decent but would have been better if the shrimp were grilled or sauteed. It was like they took some shrimp cocktail type of shrimp and threw them in the dish. The Poozokie was flavorful but so thin. I haven't had one of these in years, this was nothing like I remembered. The cookie was spread so thin you could barley even scrape a piece from the tin. Food was just an epic fail on this visit. Service was good and friendly but the food and drink fell short!

23,Anthony R.,"Baldwin Park, CA",24,15,1.0,1.0,2017-03-02,"This was quite possibly one I've the most inconvenient lunch I have ever experienced. The restaurant was just about empty when I arrived in a party of three for a 13:00 lunch time. I noticed hardly anyone in the beautifully architectured building, so I went to the bar high tops for quick lunch special service. Little did I know I would wait for all of service to be provide at the same time. It was a bit ridiculous. I felt like I was in a reality show testing ones patience and thinking of how only in Pasadena, CA would this happen and I was not going to sign a consent to film form. I ordered a vodka soda with a water one the side, Brussels Sprouts and the other two orders in the party were a soup and salad with waters. The soups and salads are ready made dishes, meaning you set it and serve it. However, it took a total of 20 min to serve cold soup (oil had elevated to the top of the cooking soup) and salad. It was what appeared to be some one who served the first two dishes and waited for the third dish to be ready. All at the same time forgetting the drinks, because everything was served at the same time. I mean EVERYTHING. When we asked for an second serving of the endless soup and salad. It took another lengthy amount of time before we saw a soup, and the soup order was the wrong one. In the end we paid for a $30 something lunch that really made me just want to walk out in that bill. When we called to share our experience, we were sent an generic apology letter with $15 in credit. This was very disparaging for the brand. The location is perfect for a great restaurant, or service team that actually cares for their customers, rather than pretentiously running thru the early crowd, assuming that they don't tip anyway so what's the point.

205,Rafael H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,2017-03-04,It was my first time dining at a BJ's restaurant. The place looks really nice inside with chandeliers and there's a gigantic tv at the bar. Upon arrival we were told it was a 5 minute wait which isn't so bad considering it was a Friday night. We were seated rather quickly and ordered our drinks and appetizer. One of the drinks they forgot about and was brought water instead until I brought it to the waiters attention. After that the appetizer took a good 30-40 minutes to come out and we still had to wait another 10 before the waiter took our actual order. Then our waiter eventually went MIA on us and we had 2 or 3 different ones attend us for the remainder of the night. To top it off me and my girlfriend both got really bad stomachaches about halfway through our meal.

Couple of highlights... shoes up and host wasn't present. 2 more groups, 1 more group. It's dinner time and host is gone for 5-10 minutes while people are piling up. Meanwhile 3-4 other employees cruise by host station, but can't help. Everybody looking at each other wondering what's happening. Host finally shows up and said she was clearing table. This place probably has 50 people working dinner shift, but she had to bus tables. Another, got drinks but waiter disappears and doesn't come back for order.

Just calling the restaurant was a bigger chore than it had to be, I was placed on hold for more than 5 minutes when trying to place an order. Then and there, I should have gotten the hint and asked everyone if they wanted something different. Instead I finally got to place an order with a curt employee who constantly asked me ""Is that it?"" after I had already informed him this would be an order for an OFFICE. I hung up the phone thinking that if the customer service was that crummy, the actual food has got to be some degree better. No, it was not.  Major disappointment. Those who ordered salads complained of missing advertised ingredients and general distasteful greens. A salad that looks luxurious and gourmet on the menu more accurately resembled something you would pick up at an off-brand liquor store in a run-down neighborhood.

I don't have a TV so sometimes I come here to watch sports. Everything is overpriced and indifferently cooked. Nothing on the menu is particularly interesting. It's a BJs, it is what it is! If you are in the mood for deep dish pizza and you don't mind overpaying for a basic pizza, go for it. Otherwise, do a little research and find a place with passion and a unique take.  The worst part of this location, and perhaps all locations, is the happy hour, which is really lame. 1 hour off of already overpriced beer and cocktails. It brings them down from ridiculously overpriced, to moderately overpriced. But it still enrages me to purchase a single beer for the price of a six pack. When you do this in a bar there is something else you are paying for and for me it is the opportunity to watch a sports event of some sort.

Parking:  Located on the corner of Marengo Ave., and Colorado Blvd. They on the corner area towards Marengo, if you're coming out of the Pasadena Paseo mall. They don't validate inside the restaurant, but the mall does have a tiny validation station (right next to the two vending machines) right as you're coming up the escalators in their underground parking lot.  First 90mins are free, and any time over, you pay the remainder balance.  Ambience and décor wise, it's clean and spacious. Tons of TVs to watch all your favorite sports. Their bar area is gigantic and beautiful - two huge walls of liquor for all hearts' content. Since it was a weekday, it was slow and quiet, which I didn't mind since it was great for catching up. I ended up ordering the Lunch Portion:  Sandwich & Soup Entrée: California Chicken Club Sandwich+ Vegan Lentil with Ancient Grains Soup. Tyler, our server, brought out my Vegan Lentil with Ancient Grains soup first. I wanted something healthy, and decided to try this out, and I was sure glad that I did! For a vegan dish, it was really hearty! Generous portions of green lentils, ancient grains, tender carrots and onions cooked in a yummy tomato broth. Highly recommended, and I would totally get this again. Doesn't even feel like you're even really eating your veggies and grains ;) Afterwards, came my California Chicken Club Sandwich served with a side of French fries. Since this was the lunch portion, it came with half a sandwich, but it was hearty too! Fresh and layered with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes, served on sourdough bread with roasted garlic aioli spread. The fries itself were crispy, generous and seasoned properly without being super greasy. I've definitely enjoyed my sandwich, and would get it again. Drink:  I opted for an unsweetened citrusy green tea drink. I had two glasses, and it was cool and refreshing to enjoy with my meal. Service: Tyler, our server was nice, but somewhat forgetful. With my meal and drinks, he was on point, but with my friends' meals, he was somewhat forgetful. Either he didn't get their meals brought out the same time as the rest of our table, or he forgot utensils for some of them. However, the one big no-no he did - one of my friends requested sweet potato fries with her Caesar salad, and instead got regular French fries. Tyler ended up taking away her French fries, which he shouldn't have. Instead, he should have left them there, and brought her out a new plate of sweet potato fries. Standard restaurant procedures.

The waiter kindly offered to bring her out a new meal. We waited another 10-15 minutes and nothing was brought out. We had all finished eating by this point. The waiter asked if she would like a salad or soup but at this point we asked for it to be wrapped up to go and comp'd. The waiter complied.

199,Joyce C.,"Arcadia, CA",94,15,1.0,1.0,2017-06-11,"I wish there was an option on Yelp to give no stars. Our waiter's name was Roman (the name that appeared on the check, but who knows if he's logged onto someone else's account to avoid blame). So here's a physical description of him: Skinny blonde white boy, possibly around 5'6"" with a shit ton of sass. He should be fired. To be honest, I do not know why he was even there tonight. We sat down around 10pm, and we didn't even get our order in until maybe around 11pm-ish, and that's me trying to make him sound better. The waiter blamed the new computer system, he showed us how it was malfunctioning. But there was no troubleshooting. He wouldn't pull out a paper and pen because he says that it's stupid if waiters can't remember people's orders (guess what he forgot). He sat down next to my friends, and when we finally got the order in, he told us that he'll be eating pizookie with strangers a few tables down. He LITERALLY did that, and another half an hour went by without us getting our food. Now I know restaurants have waiters who spit in food, so I just didn't want spit on top of waiting for forever. So I was patient while glaring at this kid waiter. The food finally came, but not all the food. But Roman was gone again. We got a busser to get the remaining food to us. And then Roman's sitting back at that table looking at his hands with the ""strangers"" shining an iPhone light over him and eating more food and drinking more of whatever he had there. The hero amongst us went to find the manager, because her pizookie hadn't come yet, and that's what she was here for. The manager, Richard, confronted the waiter Roman, and said he'd fix our bill. Roman came back and gave sass about the computer forgetting the pizookie. He forgot it, and then blamed the kitchen. No apology. He got the pizookie, said he'd pay for it for all the trouble. Everyone else is done eating and is now waiting for the check. 11:45pm. We don't get our check until 12:00am ish. Yes, we're now literally in a brand new fucking day. Our bill has not been fixed. He split all our checks without asking first. So our hero went to demand the manager honor his word. She's gone for 10 minutes, battling the stubbornness of this restaurant's management. The waiter is there too, claiming he was told by us to split the bill and claiming that none of anything is his fault. The three of them are arguing for these 10 minutes. An estimation of what is probably 12:20am - Ms. Sass Roman gives attitude to our hero, handing her the new bill, and gives more attitude. Never once has he said sorry or anything. We finally get everything figured out, and leave by 12:25/30am of the day after we entered the doors of the BJs in Pasadena. So that's 2.5 hours at a restaurant that was pretty empty. Corporate BJ's, if you need to close stores, start with Pasadena. Or at least train your employees in common courtesy and customer service. And give your employees a damn pad of paper and pen for when your system dies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=40,2.8,2.52,2.54,2.468,2.632

Especially since they are still offering the garlic rolls with dinner.  If they weren't doing that, then I wouldn't go back; I'd go to a different restaurant that does include bread with the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pasadena?start=60,3.36,2.78,2.636,2.7640000000000002,3.012

Lately I have been having a craving for pizookis and luckily they are having a special where all their pizookis are $3 until the end of October 2017. I think after that date they still offer this promotion on Tuesdays.  All the different pizookis on their menu are fair game for this promotion so eat to your hearts content. Some of the flavors you are able to do half and half. I believe the only flavors you have to do whole are the marshmallow peanut butter s'mores and monkey bread.  On two visits I have tried almost all their flavors. I usually come with a group of 4 people and 3 pizookis are more than enough for us to share. My favorites would be the double dark chocolate, peanut butter, chocolate chunk and monkey bread. Each comes with 2 scoops of ice cream on top of the molten cookie.

In addition to this, there were no place settings at the table until I asked for them after receiving the food. I ordered the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs, which I had ordered before from a different BJ's and thoroughly enjoyed, but for some reason it was so unbelievably spicy at this location I could barely get through each bite and my lips were left burning. My friend tried it as well and confirmed to me it wasn't just due to my taste buds (and, to note, I do enjoy spicy things, but this was an intense, unwanted spice).

BJ's made the food on time but Amazon's driver never showed. The takeout rep called me and informed me of Amazon's fail. I ordered the artichoke hearts appetizer and the crispy chicken salad and didn't want food that was sitting in a hot box so I asked if they would re-make the artichokes before I came to pick up, they agreed and they re-made the salad for me too. They also refunded me in full for the hassle of having to pick up myself. The manager and host were very apologetic when I picked up, much more helpful than most BJ's staff I've encountered!  Both my appetizer and salad were delicious. The artichoke hearts had a mild but tasty breading and the dipping sauce was a nice complement. As for the salad, I would have hoped for a bit more fried chicken than I got, but it was well cooked and not too heavily breaded with good lean pieces of chicken within. All the ingredients tasted crisp and fresh, and the honey mustard dressing was the way to go for sure. Parking will be at the Paseo mall.
