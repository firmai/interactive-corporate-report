Dianna N.,"Pequannock, NJ",40,172,2,4.0,1/9/2018,"I usually hate chain restaurants but I wanted to post what a good experience I had here.  My waiter was a pleasure , very friendly and gave prompt service and great suggestions. I had an Asian pear martini which was delish. Not overly sweet and not too boozy. I really wanted a second one but I was driving. My veggie burger was outstanding. I love the combo of grains and veggies and it was enough for two meals for me! It is something I will certainly be back for! My only complaint is a common one, it is super busy and loud but there is nothing you can do about that ! It's good for a bite while shopping in the mall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Jessi T.,"Maywood, NJ",287,351,201,4.0,1/6/2018,"Good, ol' reliable Cheesecake Factory.  The food is good, the portions are big, you always know what you're getting.   If you're looking for stability in an unstable world, have a meal at The Cheesecake Factory.  You're going to feel safe, secure and full. I ate here recently after not having eaten here probably since my last review of this place in 2008.  It was great.  The service was nice, the bread still tasted the same, the menu was still mostly the same.  And now that I have a job, the prices don't seem that bad.  Maybe some would see those things as cons but hey, I liked it.  Honestly. The only thing I didn't like is when they went to seat us the table was still dirty and they bum rush cleaned it while we awkwardly stood and waited.  Why tell us the table is ready if it isn't?  Ah, well.  Water under the bridge my Cheesecake Factory.  I'll see you soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Cindy F.,"Ridgefield, NJ",165,260,380,1.0,12/28/2017,"I stopped in here to dine at the beginning of December with my mother and 2 children ( 2 1/2 and 7 months old) after taking photos with Santa in the mall. The hostess was horrendous and the manager did NOTHING to compensate us.  First when we entered the hostess told me to stand with my double stroller behind the hostess desk. Which honestly I was just going to ignore. Even though I felt she was trying to hide my double stroller or something. Instead I sat down anyway. To make more room I decided to take one of the detachable seats off the stroller and place it in the car. It took all of 45 seconds, my car was right outside. When I got back my mom said someone came to sit us. I went to hostess desk to inquire. Omg she was the biggest b*#tch. Almost laughing that we were going to be put on the list again. Even after the person who came to sit us came back saying it was okay. At this point we are arguing and I asked to speak to the manager. The girl was pointing and rolling her eyes at me it was completely ridiculous. The manager finally comes and they sit us in the 'bar' section. (Because people sitting in the bar really want to be entertained by my two young children.). The manager apologized but did NOTHING to rectify the situation.  Our waitress was however very nice. My children go to restaurants all the time and are always well behaved. This was my first time dining at this Cheesecake Factory since they moved locations in the mall. I will not be back. Which is sad because I frequented this restaurant when pregnant with my son.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Jenny K. L.,"Oradell, NJ",166,489,472,2.0,12/14/2017,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this place. It's my favorite chain restaurant for every type of meal, and since they moved to a larger location, I've been going even more often. However!!! Door Dash has changed our lives.  They are wonderful.  However, the take out/delivery experience at Cheesecake when it comes to the packaging of the food is always sub par at best.  The quantity and quality of food is significantly less and there seems to always be a little something missing.  For example this time they forgot our bread, which I was looking forward to to lap up the sauce on my chicken Romano which has quickly become my favorite entree here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
ToniAnn D.,"Maywood, NJ",192,116,140,4.0,10/1/2017,"I used to be the biggest fan of Cheesecake Factory, but It faded. They have a extensive menu and the best cheesecakes, but every time I go I never know what to get lol. Probably because the menu offers So much. I must say, I always get the same usual things: the skinnylicous salmon, the chicken Romano, or Santa Ve chicken sandwich- all great options. I also love that they serve the best warm and soft bread when you sit down. It's definitely a perk of eating here! For dessert, you have to get the cheesecake! That's a given. Some of my favorites include the Oreo, s'mores, snickers, & the plain strawberry. I've had many things on their menu and everything is always good. Some people find them pricey but they do serve big portions, so there's room for left overs !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Belle D.,"Dumont, NJ",447,60,72,4.0,9/22/2017,"My family came here on a Sunday night for my parent's anniversary. Since we all have different food preferences, Cheesecake Factory is always a great place for us since they have a very extensive menu. I ordered the turkey burger and was in love. The garlic aioli was such a perfect pair for the burger. My sister ordered her go to item, the Louisiana chicken pasta. The food has always been consistent through my numerous visits. For dessert, we ordered the Oreo and the coffee cheesecakes. Both were delicious and very rich, so they're both best paired with coffee. I was surprised that the chocolate cake layer on the coffee cheesecake was very dense, almost brownie-like. Either way, it was a perfect way to end our meal. The service seemed subpar - the waiter took 15 minutes before he was able to even greet us, but he apologized saying there was an issue with the credit card machine. Overall, great place for dinner, especially for large groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Rohit S.,"Dumont, NJ",8,73,201,3.0,8/29/2017,"My last few visits have not been so swell, but today was an exception. Everything was going fantastic till the entrees (which needed an inordinate amount of time to prepare- NOT WORTH THE WAIT) came into the picture. Nevertheless, let's discuss the good before the bad. The Pina Coladas were great! The starters (both new to my taste buds) were exceptional.  I wish we had gotten up and left prior to the following events. The chicken parm-pizza style pasta was a disaster (Ah! What a mess). The texture is hard to put into words; it was grainy and chewy. Besides, I ate so much bread waiting for the arrival of my entree I could not fit only but a few bites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Dor I.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",4,9,7,1.0,12/17/2017,"If I could put no stars, I would. 45 minutes to get drinks. Unbelievable/unreal. The waiter was no where to be found so we couldn't even tell anyone that we were waiting. Very unpleasant experience. The place is extremely hot and without drinks we were definitely getting dehydrated. Still, no drinks. We got appetizers but no drinks. We asked the food runner and he said that he will check. No drinks for another 20 minutes. We got the food, again no drinks on the table. We again told the food runner that we were waiting for the drinks, but he ran away like he couldn't care less. We have food but no drinks. I'm not gonna say anything else about this place, use your judgement.

Jewel Y.,"New York, NY",120,759,3318,5.0,10/25/2017,"I almost never Yelp about the waiter but I gotta give big kudos to our waiter Angel, thanks for being so accommodating and making our dining experience so pleasant tonight!!! He made up for our not so great last visit, in which we were hardly getting any attention from our waitress perhaps due to our table location (outside facing the indoor shops) and she didn't look very happy working there. In contrast with the last server, Angel was super attentive, made sure we were happy with everything and maintained a very positive and friendly attitude throughout our dinner, which was very refreshing to see. I can see he enjoys his job and takes pride in what he does, which is so rare to see these days... nowadays too often we encounter unfriendly service and I wish more waiters would smile more just like this waiter Angel. We were observing him and we were impressed how hard he was working so I decided to ask his name, so that I can surprise him by mentioning him in my review. I come here quite often but I must say he was the best server I've ever had at Cheesecake Factory.

jason K.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,63,2,2.0,1/2/2018,"The quality of the food was poor at this location. I suspect there is lack of oversight in the kitchen.  After disappointing food, I looked through yelp and found a significant number of bad reviews for this place.  I think management needs to urgently get to the bottom of the problem and figure out why the food coming out of the kitchen isn't at  par with  other Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The food feels un-fresh, not expertly cooked and flavors are off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack

Christopher D.,"Lodi, NJ",255,342,2312,3.0,5/30/2017,"As I am typing my review,  I am tasting the sweet plantains from my order that was surprisingly good at my desk at work. Lol  I've been here plenty of times but it has been a while. My recent visit was yesterday with the fam per their request. There was 45 minute wait but we were seated in about 30 minutes which was a world record for me coming to Cheesecake Factory establishments so off to a good start.  Our waitress was pretty attentive and very energetic in a good way. She went a head and took our drink orders as we were still deciding of what to eat. As we got our drinks, we went ahead and ordered our meals. I ordered the Jamaican Shrimp with black beans and rice and plantains. I was expecting a mediocre dish at best based on previous experiences lol but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised it had a decent flavor and tasted pretty good. My daughter ordered the Four Cheese Pasta. which she enjoyed but I tasted it and was not impressed at all. I didn't taste 4 cheeses and the flavor was bland to average.My son had the Mac N Cheeseburger which he enjoyed and the fries it came with tasted very good. He crushed it. Kids both ordered cheese cake slices which of course is the one thing they do have that's pretty Damm amazing lol and earned the right to be called Cheesecake Factory. I am not a big cheesecake person but I have to admit I like their cheesecake's in particular.  Overall listen it is a huge Chain spot and the food is okay you pay more for the name than the overall quality in my opinion. The sister company Grand Lux Cafe to me has way better food quality. I would recommend this place if you are a true Cheesecake fan because that they do extremely well no doubt about it. Kids were happy which is all that matters I guess lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Nichole S.,"South Hackensack, NJ",169,80,33,4.0,6/27/2017,"I opted to come here after a very long hiatus - and didn't even realize they moved locations within the same mall square. My friend had recently mentioned the Cheesecake Factory and I decided I needed me some oversized portions for a good price.  I was seated immediately and my server was a little slow but nice nonetheless. I knew exactly what I wanted due to my extensive research during work hours- shhh. Anyways I ordered the chicken Riesling dish- but customized it with crispy chicken instead of that grilled nonsense. It added the perfect texture against the rich and creamy mushrooms and bacon with buttered pasta. It lacked a little seasoning but I was able to counteract that with the salt and pepper provided on the tables. I was extremely satisfied with my choice so I decided to try dessert as well.  I have been craving carrot cake for a while now so that's what I went it. The cake itself was moist and tender, the cream cheese filling was pleasant. All in all it was a very good dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack

Finally I decided to have white rice with orange chicken and it was delicious. Sat outside as it was a nice night and the service was also good. Staff was very helpful as they gave suggestions for different meals they felt I should try. With a menu like what they have, I would definitely come back so that I can eventually try everything. Also the cheesecake they had was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack
Anne S.,"Paramus, NJ",0,11,7,1.0,12/26/2017,"This review is solely based on the food experience. I would give ZERO stars if I could.  It was my family's first time at The Cheesecake Factory after they reloacted to the other side of the mall but if I can turn back time, I wouldn't have gone there.  The food was inedible and I still cannot believe that the food came to our table in the condition that it did. Our family went on Christmas Eve around brunch time, probably a bad idea for future reference.  The food took FOREVER to come out, although the restaurant itself didn't seem as packed as it would be on a usual Sunday brunch time.  When the food came out, the server informed me that the plate was VERY hot, so becareful.  At first glance, the food looked ok.  I had ordered a meatloaf, took a bite and it had a burnt taste so I looked at the dish more carefully and I saw that all four outer sides of the meatloaf was burnt.  Our waiter came to check on us and I told him that my meatloaf is a bit burnt.  He asked if we wanted anything else to replace my dish but I declined since we waited so long for our meal to come out and told him I'll just eat around it.  I took a bite of the mashed potato that came with my meatloaf and it was quite cool and the outer part was some what hard - almost as if it had been sitting out for a while.  I then tried to eat the ""unburned"" part of my meatloaf by trying to cut the burnt sides off of it and flipped the meatloaf around only to find a disgustingly burnt meatloaf on the othter side.   I wanted to speak to the manager at this point so we were waiting to flag down our waiter.  Our 10 month old baby was getting fussy while all this was going on so I tried to give him some pancake from one of my kid's dish.  I grabbed the pancake with my hands and I felt a hard, crunchy texture - almost like a toast! I flipped the pancake over and that too was burnt! Our waiter finally came around and we told him we NEED to speak with the manager.  He was more than willing to get the manager so we waited.  While we were waiting, my husband and I were questioning all of our food so we took a bite from the other kid's dish - spaghetti and meatball.  My kid is 2 years old and he was just happy to finally eat his food so he was just digging in but when we took a bite, the pasta had a rubbery texture and the pasta was all clumped together.  Five minutes later, a chef or a cook wearing a cook's uniform came to our table.  I showed him my dish, and explained that my child's pancake was burnt and that he should try grabbing it to feel it himself.  I also told him the spaghetti is either undercooked or it was sitting out too long because it has a rubbery texture.  He looked at our food and told us that the meatloaf and pancake is definitely burnt and apologized.  He asked if we would like something else to replace our dish, but we declined and told him we just want to pay for our drinks and one ""edible"" dish that we barely touched because of everything that was going on.  The chef/cook left and our waiter came to the table and informed us that the bill had been waived so we didn't need to pay anything.  My children were still cranky so my husband had to goto Smashburger across the mall from The Cheesecake Factory to get some burgers for them.  I'm just sorry to my three little children who had to spend an hour at the restaurant without having a proper meal and I'm sorry for myself for losing my appetite and I'm sorry to my husband that our meal was a disaster.  I'm also sorry for our waiter who had to get the chef/cook and apologize on behalf of the cook who cooked or tried to cook that food for us to eat.  If I could, I would like to see that person try to eat the food that was sent out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack

Absolutely no sense of urgency and no personality. Def a desperate hire for Cheesecake Factory.  Here was the biggest issue. Our appetizers came at the exact same time as our entrees. The server warned us, but did not attempt any guest recovery! He offered a free cheesecake? Servers don't have any authorization to provide comped items for guests. Instead of sending a manager over, we had to request for one to explain the situation. There is no reason for us to pay for these appetizers. The whole point of ordering an appetizer is defeated.  Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience. I've had much better service. This is def an experience to share with more social applications.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack

Jenny Y.,"Palisades Park, NJ",301,62,127,4.0,5/1/2017,"My friend and I came for lunch on a Thursday and it was surprisingly busy! The host offered indoor or outdoor seating, but we chose to go to the bar because we were in a slight crunch for time and bar service is usually quicker. Our bartender was really nice, forgot his name but made me a pretty weak Long Island Iced Tea. It came in a huge glass but tasted like too much sour mix... I'm a 102 pound girl 5 feet tall, I usually feel tipsy off one glass of wine....sooo... don't know what happened there. It was kind of difficult to get his attention, even though we were the only bar guests there. He was preoccupied stocking and cleaning or whatever and paid little attention to us. I ended up sucking down my drink like a lemonade and enjoyed my meal, regardless. The Sheila Salad definitely brings this review back up to 4 stars because it was phenomenal! Food came fast and hot, delicious and perfect!  I love the interior of this particular Cheesecake. It's very open, so you're not confused about where the bathroom is, where to find your table after you use the bathroom, where the indoor dining, bar area, and outdoor seating is. And most conveniently, it's part of the Riverside Mall, right next to Barnes and Nobles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=20

Emily C.,"Rutherford, NJ",446,74,89,4.0,9/7/2017,I don't care what anyone says...I'll always love The Cheesecake Factory!! I like the food here and portions are always super large. I personally think the lunch sizes are more reasonable but we don't always have time to sit here for lunch. Love their pasta dishes and the stuffed mushroom. Service was slow when we came. This specific restaurant is clean and spacious. The bathrooms are always clean too. There's outdoor seating but not much of a view since it's literally in front of a big parking lot.  The best deal for The Cheesecake Factory is when they give you free slices of cheesecake when you purchase a $25 gift card around Christmas time (buy it and use it on yourself!) or when it's Cheesecake Day and all their cheesecakes are half off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=20
Catherine Edre B.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",27,1,,1.0,10/9/2017,"My first review on yelp, mainly because i had a bad experience with this restaurant. I ordered on the phone for pick up, a margarita pizza, chix Alfredo, chopped salad and two cheesecakes. Said 25 mins, okay sounds reasonable.  I Come in after 25 mins to pick it up, they already charged me for it, so I thought maybe the food was ready. Waited for quite sometime only to find out that my food was just waiting in the kitchen to be picked up. First of all, don't charge a customer whose order is not even ready to begin with and has to wait for 20 mins to get it. Now, I get my food finally and I check it out and the Pasta they used was penne instead of linguini. I didn't ask for it, and it looked like slop. Manager was there and I asked him if it normally comes like this, he then apologizes and I changed it to angel hair. Waited again for another 30 mins, all for a corrected Alfredo. It has been an hour that I've been waiting. They couldn't even communicate to rush it. Finally the guy in the counter saw me and tried to rush my order from the back. I finally got it and didn't even bother to check it.  Now comes the tasting part. The pizza, as you expect, was already cold. It was a bit undercooked too. I can still taste some raw pizza dough. Sauce was good tho. The salad was okay, had balsamic vina. The only bad part was the chicken, it was one of the leftover ones you get from the slicer. The end pieces of the chicken. They didn't bother to chop that. The two cheesecakes were good, as expected. But the damn Alfredo, was a disaster. The sauce was not even seasoned, along with the chicken they use. It was like eating reduced heavy cream with just a touch of parm. Horrible, so horrible. I can't believed I payed for that slop.  Just come here for the Cheesecakes, that's it. Everything else, just a big N-O. NO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=20
Scott W.,"New York, NY",31,24,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Other Yelpers hit it spot on! Came here for a casual Sunday Brunch and while the food for fine the service was not. From start to finish we had a terrible experience, from needing to ask for water each and every time to plates and glasses not being clean up. I am not sure management actually cares about the business. Each time it took so long that we needed to ask where the drinks were, where the appetizers were and where the entrees were. We got our 2nd round of drinks only after we asked another server to check on it and after we finished our meals, clearly someone forgot to place in the order. This is a management issue, they are clearly either understaffed or untrained.  We paid our bill and told the manager our comments but outside of a few rehearsed ""sorry"" lines, he walked away. Given that its owned by the same parent company with similar menus go down the road to to Grand Lux. The management team actually wants your business. Yelpers I encourage you to not only leave your comments but speak with you wallet and go to a different spot. Only when this location feels it on their P/L do they have incentive to change.

Jacqueline G.,"Bergen County, NJ",0,20,,3.0,1/2/2018,"To start off, I really love The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is big offering all different types of food and I've never gotten a meal I didn't love. I've been here twice since they moved to the other side of the mall, most recently yesterday, 1/1/2018, with my sister after a little New Year shopping. One thing that baffles me is why, when rebuilding, they didn't open the foyer area up more. You come in and are given a pager and told your wait time and then after it goes off you wait some more on the other side of the hostess stand. I don't mind waiting & always come prepared to wait because I understand the high demand of this place however waiting on top of strangers in heavy coats is frustrating since they just redid this place and had the chance to fix it. Moving on - we were seated, given menus and soon realized it was going to take our waitress awhile to get to us as another table next to us was flagging down other servers trying to find her. I'm assuming she had another section to wait on since I rarely saw her in the area, which is fine but if you're going to give a server two sections try to make them somewhat near each other that way she can easily check on both. Eventually she came over and took our drink order, which, thank God because between shopping and the wait, I was thiiiiirsty. I got the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta from the Skinnylicious menu and my sister got the Mac n Cheese Burger. I love the Skinny menu because I usually order apps (all time FAVORITE is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - GET THEM) and can still order a meal and not feel like I can't breathe after. My sister asked to sub out regular fries for sweet potato ones and was told that's fine however when the food was brought out the woman delivering it said ""Oh yeah we don't have any more sweet potato fries so we gave you regular fries is that ok?"" Not having an item is no big deal but bringing the food out and THEN asking if that's ok when its already in front of the patron? Maybe next time take the time to come out and actually ask if there's another side she may want instead. Besides that, everything got devoured pretty quickly and afterwards we ordered a piece of our go-to Dulce de Leche cheesecake to share.

Patrick D.,"Chesterfield, VA",1,210,66,3.0,4/6/2017,"Food was excellent, but service was VERY lacking.  I've eaten a lot of places, but this was actually my first trip to The Cheesecake Factory. I was very happy with my meal, as was my wife, but server was lacking. He was probably having an ""off"" night, but he didn't smile, talk much or check our table often. That was a disappointment.  We waited a long time from being seated to getting drinks. A long time waiting to have our order taken, and a very long time to order dessert. So long that we asked to see a manager. He was kind and comped desserts and also took our tea and soda off the check. From ordering to receiving our entrees was not bad at all.  That was a review saver, because without that the service was so bad - it could have been only 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=20

Mikhail V.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",20,273,209,3.0,3/7/2017,It's a decent representative of the chain.  Nothing more nothing less.  The place matches every other Cheesecake Factory out there.  Large in a busy mall with large amount of food traffic and large menu to compliment its largeness. The only problem with the large menu is that the food becomes hit or miss proposition for the patrons.  Depending on the time of the day the day of the week and the chef running the kitchen today but if you're looking to come to a place fancier than let's say Panera Bread then this place is for you and it the choices are going to be the same across the various places in the chain. One good thing that I do have to note is that the kids love their cheesecakes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=20

Missy S.,"New York, NY",503,220,143,4.0,11/27/2016,"This place consistently delivers quality lunch at the mall. What else could you really expect or ask for? Service is great. Atmosphere is good for any size party and the menu could accommodate any human any or every day of the year, as it is so varied. Salads, sandwiches, burgers, and apps are all solid choices. Portions are gigantic, so be sure to share or be ready to be stuffed and take something home.  Note: anything not on the skinny menu has SUPER high calories. So proceed at your own risk and/or share appropriately.  Four stars because it is reliable, consistent high quality (mall) food.  Best dishes: Thai lettuce wraps Any of the salads on the skinnny or non skinny menu Burgers Cuban sandwich Enjoy. And yes of course, the cheesecake is light, fluffy, and bangin'.

We all quickly scanned the huge menu and decided on our drinks and meals.  My drink of choice was a mojito which was very good.

The prices are just right and they offer you big helpings of whatever you ordered. The wait staff is very nice and knowledgable about the menu. Parking isn't an issue since it's in a mall and the bathroom are very clean. CONS: Theres always a long wait, not just because it's popular, but because the bus boys are slow at turning over tables. When it's not busy the restaurant will stick you in the corner by the window looking into the mall rather than in the center of the room. The plastic menus are always sticky and the food takes a long time to come out. OVERALL: This is a typical cheesecake factory.

Denée O.,"Secaucus, NJ",38,1,1,1.0,1/3/2017,"When me and my family got here, the place was packed. It was about 5:30 p.m. on a Monday. We had to wait an hour which is fair because it was 7 of us. But after getting called up, the hostesses told us to move to the left. It looked like other people were waiting to get seated too. Why call us up if we're gonna have to wait 5 extra minutes for a table to clear up? My aunt and grandma can't stand up for long as they have knee issues so they were definitely feeling annoyed. But whatever. When we sat down, it took a good 10-15 mins for a server to come and ask us for our drinks. Like I know the place is packed but still. We were also missing one small plate and we had to ask two different servers to get one.   My family and I shared buffalo wings, calamari, crab cakes and the egg roll sampler. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it was very dry so I asked for more sauce. It tasted alright but the chicken tasted like it had too much olive oil. I think they refried it. I wanted to try some cheesecake because they're famous for the cheesecake so why the hell not? So I got the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake. That was the only good thing apart from the brown bread. After we finished paying, I got really nauseous and it wasn't until the next morning that woke up in a cold sweat and threw up.

Tom G.,"Rutherford, NJ",165,217,2217,4.0,5/8/2016,"Not long ago I saw a photo taken by Yelper Tina C. of Plainview, NY of an Oreo Cheese Cake. I was craving for a taste and I looked up the Cheesecake Factory and realize that they are a franchised and their are at half a dozen near me within driving distance and one in a place I used to live, Hackensack NJ. The web site menu had more than a dozen cheese cakes and had take out too, which made it even more convenient for me since now I don't need to do a solo sit down just for dessert. The decor of the Hackensack restaurant is nice and it is big with two dinning sections and one with a full bar. They have a parking lot and they are part of the up-sale River Side Mall. So it was easy to do some shopping and have a bite to eat on my visits I must have gone to the Cheesecake Factory 8 times and half of that I stayed to eat there. Always for dessert, and mostly for cheese cake, the other times I had Strawberry Shortcake, Black Out, and Carrot cake. So for the cheese cakes I had Oreo, Strawberry, Godiva Chocolate, Red Velvet, Snickers Chocolate, Salted Carmel, Lemon Mousse Meringue, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. And this is only a third of what is available. They all taste good and better than you would think from a franchised restaurant, but of course some of the cheese cakes tasted better than the others. They are light cheese cakes and they don't give you oversize slices, with lots of cream and pliantly of strawberries for the strawberries cakes including a 6 inch round mini. My top three are: 1) Strawberry Cheese cake and the Shortcake. 2) Salted Carmel 3) Raspberry Truffle The atmosphere and staff were friendly but real busy so be a little patent they will get to your needs ASP..  One note is the cake slices are huge like 10 inches high so plan on shearing with someone and make it even more fun.

Nick A.,"Teaneck, NJ",82,23,21,1.0,10/22/2016,"Came to have lunch with my wife and daughter.. went to check in and the host with the piercing through her lip was fooling around while the other host was being serious. We sat down to find a very friendly waitress Kendal. We ordered our drinks and my 1 year olds food. Spaghetti and meatball.  Her food came right out. I tasted her food as always. Restaurants tend to undercooked pasta for children just to get it out. Anyways when I tasted it it was beyond salty and still kinda raw. The server was very sweet and took it back to the kitchen. She totally understood. She came back very upset stating that the manager couldn't remake the pasta without salt. This raised several questions to myself. A restaurant this large with so many locations, who claim to make everything here. They don't have a pot to boil water and make pasta? Well I asked to speak to a manager. A sloppy looking manager with his shirt untucked and stains under his armpits came to the table. Very offensive told us he can not do it. Every time I asked him if they had a pot to boil water he would respond, the pot we use has salt. When I asked if I looked at the kitchen would I find a pot, cause I would cook I if they don't want to. At this point he told me they would do it but would take a long time. As if he was trying to selling me out of buying the pasta. Needless to say my daughter loves pasta. About 15 mins later Kendal returned with a huge smile with the pasta. Again I tasted it the pasta was still undercooked and still salty. Looks like they used pre cooked pasta and tried to wash the salt off. COME ON... the server felt so bad telling us she wanted to cool it right for us but she isn't a cook.  the 3rd time it came out I thought for sure the manager would stop by the table. Nope it was the server. Pasta still had salt on it but st this point I was tired of waiting  I got the Shepard pie which was average My wife got the grilled salmon with mash and asparagus. She asked for it cooked med and it was charred on one end  We asked them to hold the food until my daughter food came out. It appeared that the food was made and it just sat. Mine was cold and my wife's was at room temp at best. So no one really ate since my daughter takes naps at 12 and started to get cranky. She always naps after lunch today she didn't eat lunch. Thank Cheesecake Factory  So when the check came out I thought I would see the manager maybe get an apology from him for my kids food. Nope We were charged full price even though my daughters pasta took a 35mins to be cooked right!  When we left I asked the host the managers name and her response was ""he doesn't like us to tell people his name"". Agains thanks for a $70 lunch that no one ate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=80

Like all other chains - it's hard to resist being able to feed the entire family and the adults get their slosh on all for under $70 (and that's with some serious doggie-bags to bring home).  Similar to Donald Trump's current lead with the GOP's - you can't help but admire that the Cheesecake Factory is so brazen and in-your-face and just plows ahead with ridiculous portions and could care less about obesity and heart disease. The pizza lunch special - the salad was completely okay for a few mouthfuls of lettuce and a sliver of tomato. Their Portofino Pizza - surprisingly good crust, solid amount of chicken and peppers.  Only real gripe was the thin and watery pesto that was leaking underneath to make the pie soggy.

Although there were a lot of people waiting in line, since the place is so massive, we were sat in about 5 minutes. Our waitress was really friendly, as was the busser fellow who brought everything out.  What really won everyone over at our table was my order of Hibachi Steak -- a large portion of Hanger Steak (which I asked for rare) which was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender, on a bed of bean sprouts and onions, with a side of skin-on red-potatoes and wasabi butter, accompanied by a sort of light teriyaki sauce -- this dish was banging, and my friends kept offering to trade me bites of theirs just so they could keep taking more bites of mine. Oh, and the breads they brought to our table, three different types, were warm and delicious. My friend's salad was everything she expected, while my other friend's Chicken Tortillas came with excellent beans and amazing corn cakes but the main component was underwhelming. For dessert, I didn't care much for the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake but the Key Lime Cheesecake was absolutely addictive... I never got to eat at chain restaurants or even fast food as a kid, and living in NYC it's really never even been a consideration for me, but I've always heard great things about the Cheesecake Factory and now I know why. This was my second experience and it was terrific. Although my first experience at the Yonkers location was a nightmare, I'm glad I gave the company a second chance, and this location was just great.

We were taken aback when we received the bill and saw that they banged us for $20 worth of Campari. To be charging $5 extra for a SPLASH of Campari is outrageous. Never experienced this anywhere else.  We talked to THREE managers. They each gave the same ''this is corporate policy'' BS. ZERO effort made to help us out with the inconvenience. We were expecting the ridiculous $20 Campari charge to be taken off, but they couldn't even offer up a coupon and couldn't even utter a ''sorry'' to us. This is absolutely inexcusable. Not to mention we ran up a $160 bill as well... 2 rounds of drinks, an app, entree and dessert to go... EACH.

Bharath B.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,5,,3.0,3/6/2016,"So went to cheesecake factory at Hackensack yesterday, must say it took 15 mins to find parking... with a baby we had to wait for 30 mins to get a table. We were lucky to sit while we were waiting and there were many seniors and kids waiting to sit before they got a table. When it's cold outside, restaurants need to give people some extra seating arrangements at least while waiting. Ordered kale quinoa salad and veggie melt sandwich with fresh tomato basil mozzarella flatbread app. The Good: Veggie melt sandwich was heavenly. Even as I sit the next day I can feel the flavor calling my name. It was just rightly balanced with lots of veggies and less cheese. The toast on it was crunchy and you can hear that if you run a knife on it. Rustic and Awesome!! The Fair: our TBM flatbread was too good to look at (artistic and all)... however one bite and I knew someone had gone overboard with salt. Surprisingly the hubby was ok with extra salt, so, mheh... who cares for skinnylicious qpp having more sodium :p The Ugly: the so called super salad was horrible. First it was like someone just threw torn kale on a plate. Then inspecting a bit I could see quinoa. The taste was not right. Basically kale is a bit bitter so instead of making a salad with a hint of kale for bitterness, the entire dish was bitter. Cut grapes here and there helped a bit but once there were no more grapes left, it became inedible. The waiter was great to get me extra bread to cleanse the bitterness from my pallet.

Then the second time I went to eat I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. Which when you read the description sounds very promising, but unfortunately was not. First they forgot my sweet plantains but somehow they put them on my boyfriend's plate, so he thought it was his and ate them. Kinda made me sad lol and then when I actually tasted the dish it lacked in flavor. Like it's crazy how a little bit of salt can make a big difference in a meal.

We had avocado egg roles for an appetizer and miso salmon and pork sandwich for an entree. Everything tasted really good!!!  The only downside of this location of the Cheesecake Factory is that the cheesecake(we ordered strawberry cheesecake) was very disappointing.

Arshi K.,"Hoboken, NJ",671,317,569,3.0,11/20/2014,"There's something for everyone at Cheesecake Factory and it's out go-to place when we have family visiting.  This location is a little dull compared to the one in Shorthills Mall which has better customer service than this one. Here the staff is politely indifferent and once you ignore that  and concentrate on the real reason you're here...the cheesecake...you can have a good time. This time we just had a range of apps and didn't opt for the main course and couldn't be happier - we unanimously feel that the small plates are much better than the main course at the Cheesecake Factory and they have an extensive menu to choose from. The Avocado egg rolls, Dynamite shrimp and the Warm crab & artichoke dip served with crusty bread are always a hit and this time was no different. This time we also got the Beets with goat cheese salad (gotta get those greens) and the Crispy crab bites. The salad was  good, the crab bites were strictly average and smelt fishy.

The happy hour menu is tasty, affordable and great portion size. We have come for dinner here but I prefer to stick to their happy hour options.

Andrew L.,"Jersey City, NJ",51,65,8,3.0,1/8/2016,"Went out to eat here on a Wednesday evening. I was surprised to see how crowded it was for a weeknight. We were able to get a seat right away nonetheless as this location can accommodate a lot of patrons. We started off with the chicken quesadilla appetizer. It was very tasty, although the portion of guacamole that we received with it had black chunks of avocado. Not a good look. One thing I hate that some restaurants do, this one included, is that they don't list drink prices on the menu. We each ordered a sangria. It was served in a wine glass, mostly filled with ice. They came out to be $11.50 each. Definitely not worth the price. Should have none better : / keep that in mind if you go here. For my entree I order the chicken parm sandwich. It was definitely flavorful and tasty, however, the portion was small.  Overall, the food is good here. Good quality as well. I just feel like you don't really get your money's worth here. The price doesn't justify the quantity of food you receive. Other than that, no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=120
Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,940,15318,4.0,12/7/2015,"My family would make the trip to this mall at least monthly many years ago. If you live in NYC and want to eat at Cheesecake Factory this used to be the closest location. We also like the feel of home we would get from shopping in a Mall such as this one.  Like most reviews say, it is higher end stores. I like the Barnes and Noble location. You can always find gifts in there. During the time we went to this mall it was undergoing renovation. It has now become very luxurious inside. The tile floors and glass roofing are great. I love the seating area. When you shop until you drop you can sit down to rest comfortably in the mall.  The reason we don't shop here any longer involves the transportation. In Winter. We had to wait in the cold on the highway for the bus to and from NYC. I remember one day climbing over huge piles of snow to cross the highway to get the bus back to NY. I can't tell you how many times we would be flagging the bus down as it passed us by. It became to much trouble and unsafe to be out on the highway.   Someone told us about Park and Ride and the bus going to the Mall in Wayne. We started going to Willowbrook Mall. It is much easier to access from NYC. I often wonder if they started providing bus transportation to and from their parking lot. An over hang with protection during inclement weather would be nice at The Riverside Shops.  If you don't live nearby, or own a car keep this in mind when you go.  Maybe if enough people express an interest they will help us by providing this service. I would certainly like to return to Hackensack for a visit. The food and service were always great at this CCF.

Amanda S.,"Lackawaxen, PA",0,63,,2.0,4/9/2017,"My family went this Sunday evening for a birthday dinner. Food was okay and about $3 / dish overpriced. Service was mediocre. Our waitstaff served everyone from one end of the table rather than starting from one end and then going to the other. There was definitely enough room to do so and we would have been spared having to pass a cup of hot tea to the other end of the table as well as large glasses filled with soda. We also had to ask for our bread dishes and empty cups/glasses to be removed from the table before dessert was served. When a bill comes to close to $260 for 5, I would hope for better service. Note - fried calamari was excellent - stay away from strawberry shortcake dessert (doughy, heavy, strawberries in a layer on the side rather than between the biscuits) - stick with the cheesecake. Also give yourself 3 hours+ to get from start to finish. No one in our party ordered anything exotic enough to warrant such a long wait. I just read several of the most recent reviews and have seen management's notes- rather than apologizing over and over again, I would suggest fixing issues that are coming up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=120

All was healthy up until this point (and filling).  We then strayed a bit, (a lot actually).  We ordered two slices of cheesecake to go (can't go to a place named The Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake right?)  We ordered the Key Lime and the low carb (will have to let you know about the low carb when I actually eat it).   Once again, thanks Lor A for a great tip.

Porsche A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,,1.0,4/16/2017,"Don't waste your time here!!!! I have been to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations this location by far is the worse. It is Easter Sunday and I wasn't in the mood to cook so I figured I would go out to eat I thought it was perfect that they were open but I have to say the service and the food was horrible. My nearest Cheesecake Factory is the Newport Mall location which is normally very busy and a little annoying crowd wise so I figured I would try this location because it was only 30 minutes away from me. The wait time was not bad however the waiter I had was not good at all. It took 10 minutes before someone came to wait in my table I was with my son and my husband, when my waiter (Samir) arrived to my table he introduced himself and asked  to take our drink order since we knew what we wanted we ordered an appetizer and our entrees together. The drinks came very late we got our appetizer before our drinks when our drinks arrived our food took another 20 minutes. I have to say I am very disappointed by the quality of the food at the Riverside Mall location I ordered a grilled salmon with sautéed spinach and asparagus it was literally only cooked not seasoned at all not even a pinch of seasoning. I have had the same entree at other locations and it was amazing this time I was beyond disappointed. I told Samir that I was not satisfied with my food and the reason why I was unpleased and he seem to make me out to be crazy by looking at me with a confused look as if he did not understand my issue. He went to the kitchen and brought back a new plate of sides exactly the same as the original with no flavor what a ever. My husband ordered fried catfish which he said was also cooked poorly. Samir did not take any responsibility for his job he did not show any concern or made any attempt to try to satisfy us in anyway. I didn't even bother to ask for a manger because I felt like it would be a complete waste of time I got so upset I left my husband to wait for the check after waiting an additional 20 minutes for Samir to return with it. Samir just took our order brought us our food and drinks and never returned to ask if we were ok I think that if you care about service and good food when you want to go out to have dinner you should stay far away from the Cheesecake Factory at the Riverside Mall because they are HORRIBLE at everything!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=120

Our waitress was busy closing out other tables when we were seated, but she made sure to come by and let us know she'd be right back.

The cheesecake on the other hand is very tasty.  The ability for me to drive up in front, throw my hazard lights on, and run in and grab a couple of slices of great cheese cake when the craving arises is what has saved this place From a one star review.

Now to the cake. I've never had cheesecake that was so rich and moist. Each bite was heavenly. The crust at the bottom had a soft and crumbly texture that was also really good.

Now, let me start this by saying that I realize this is not a diner and that done of these things may just be personal grievances. First off, my coffee mug was dirty as there was food remnants stuck to the outside. More than that, when someone orders coffee, why would you not bring cream and sugar? I ordered coffee, a custom omelet with mushrooms, ham, peppers and cheese with potatoes and toast.  If someone orders toast with their meal, doesn't it makes sense to bring pats of butter and/or jam? Who wants to eat plain dried bread? In general I want impressed with the food. It wasn't anything I couldn't get elsewhere.

Amy P.,"Sewell, NJ",149,133,292,3.0,3/28/2015,This was only my 2nd time at a Cheesecake Factory and it was satisfactory. It was pretty busy for a Sunday at lunchtime but we were seated right away.  I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were horrible. There must have been an entire can of black beans on the bottom of the plate and then tortillas and VERY runny eggs on top. I like my eggs over easy but these must have been in the griddle for 10 whole seconds.  The salsa and avocado on top made the meal edible.  The tortillas were completely soggy. Next time I'll just order a simple sandwich.  My friend ordered the skinnilicous (sp?) chicken tacos and she really enjoyed them and wanted more (hence the 3 star rating). I was so disappointed by my slop of a meal I didn't bother ordering a piece of cheesecake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=140
Zoey L.,"Passaic, NJ",0,25,,1.0,8/28/2016,"This place was so dirty I did not even get to eat what I ordered. We walked in and the podium the hostesses stand behind was covered in straws and straw wrappers, cups and lids. Between the 7 of them behind there no one could pick this stuff up? We proceeded anyway... They sat us at one of those annoying, small, totally not intimate tables where you're right on top of your stranger neighbors and have to smell their cheap cologne and whisper if you want to have a conversation that you don't want others to be a part of. We proceeded anyway. As I was trying to squeeze into the booth end of this table without crushing the shopping mall bags of my stranger neighbors, I slipped on something. I'm going to say it was baby food? I really don't want to say it was vomit, because I'd lose my shit if it was, so we'll go with baby food. We proceeded anyway. Slipping in the ""baby food"" prompted me to peek under the table and the tables of my stranger neighbors. COVERED in garbage and brown bread crumbs and, mine, that peculiar slime. No one had swept or mopped in days. I looked up and the ""mural"" on the ceiling is COVERED in flies. I gagged, but proceeded anyway. The waitress took our order. My boyfriends salad comes out first. The plate has lipstick smeared all over it. At that point we finally got up, apologized to the waitress, told her how disgustingly dirty that place was and left.

Alexandra S.,"Rutherford, NJ",0,15,6,1.0,10/3/2015,"Let me make one thing clear...this review for the majority is not based of off the food served at Cheesecake Factory. After having an extremely poor experience at this Cheesecake Factory, I reflected on what had actually happened before writing this review as to not overreact. One evening about 2 months ago my boyfriend and I decided to venture to CF, I was having a craving for cheesecake, and the food is also pretty decent. So we were off to get dinner. When we arrived the the hostess took our name down and told us that it would be a short wait, which was fine. When we were seated it didn't take very long before we knew what we wanted to order because we always get the same thing. Our server came over and was polite. We placed our order with him when he arrived, for me the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, and for my boyfriend, a cuban sandwich. We also ordered an appetizer, fried calamari. Now for the appetizer we had a specific request, neither myself or my boyfriend like the tentacles that are normally served with fried calamari so we asked if we could have the rings only. Now this is something that we have asked for on more than one occasion and at more than one CF. The server said that there was no problem and left the table to go put in our order. A few minutes later he came back to the table and told us that he was sorry but that his manager said that it was against policy to serve the fried calamari without the tentacles. I explained to the server that we ask for this every time we come in and it has never been a problem, we asked to speak with the manager... A man came over, unfortunately I do not know his name, but he was very nice and told us that he would oblige our request for us. He did explain that it's not normally something that they do but that he would do it for us. A few moments later our fried calamari came to the table with the tentacles, so it seemed like there was some miscommunication. We explained to the food runner that the manager said he would make our order rings only, this she was not aware of, so she took the plate back to the kitchen. A few minutes after that a woman came charging over to our table and said, ""just so you guys know we can never do this for you again!!"" I replied by telling her that we already spoke to a manager and everything was taken care of. She condescendingly replied, ""I'm the manager and I don't know who told you that we do this but we don't, It's against our corporate policy!!"" I told her that this is a regular occurrence and that we have never had such a problem before. She argued with me that she doesn't do this for anyone and that our request would never have been granted at HER CF and that if corporate found out that she did this she would be in a lot of trouble. At this point there was no arguing with her. Every thing we attempted to say was shot down by her. She was so unprofessional. She had no interest in giving us a good guest experience from the start. She was right and that was it!!! We asked her for her business card with every intention of complaining to corporate and as she went to give us the card she just tossed it at us like she was doing us a favor, and then stomped away from the table like the beast that she was. If you are planning on visiting this CF remember a few key things. 1. this place is run by a female dog named, Stephanie Bucciarelli, on a power trip who obviously has no training on how to give customer service. 2. Be prepared for a mediocre experience with an upscale price tag. and 3. get your order of cheesecake to go as to spare yourself from the rudeness that is oozing out of this place. 4. If you have a complaint, voice it, because without feedback issues cannot be known or corrected. Needless to say that my boyfriend and I have not visited CF since. P.S. Many other chains like Houlihan's, Long Horn, Olive Garden, even Maggiano's don't even serve the tentacles or will hold the tentacles with no argument. I don't understand why this caused such a big problem, never has this ever been an issue at any other restaurant establishment no matter what the cost. I would think that with CF's price tag that they would want to cater to their guests and keep them as returning patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=180

Krystin B.,"Lodi, NJ",0,22,1,1.0,7/21/2016,"A place I used to call my favorite when I was younger has turned into a place I will never go to again. Not only did I give this Cheesecake a second chance after a terrible experience with undercooked filet mignon 2 years ago BUT I absolutely blame the restaurant for ruining a surprise birthday dinner I planned for my boyfriend. Let's start with the fact that this crazy busy joint on a Wednesday night in the middle of the summer does NOT take reservations. So going in there 2 weeks early in the blistering heat and finding out they don't take reservations was disappointing enough. I had to carry on and plan for my party of 12 to arrive an HOUR early (7PM) and get a table. Well, simple tasks just aren't simple. As I have someone from my party arrive early , the host tells her the table will take an hour to get. ""Perfect,"" I thought. Wrong. Not only did I have to stall my boyfriend until 815 PM but my surprise did not go as planned. Since a party of 12 adults for a birthday was not the restaurants top priority (and 3 parties of 4 is) we show up at 830 and the host says another 20 minutes (after telling my friend 10 more minutes when I was on the way). Well of course we had to ask for a manager and OF COURSE that is when magically an open table for 12 appeared. To compensate for the ruined surprised we got FREE NACHOS (yay [NOT] )! The service was nothing to brag about. The food and the drinks were probably the only thing I was satisfied about. To add to my disappointment, I asked the host who should I speak to about sending a cheesecake to the table for the birthday boy. Not only did I tell the host ""a whole cheesecake"" and that my boyfriend does not like chocolate & to make it a cherry cheesecake, BUT when its time to sing happy birthday, they brought one peice of cake and it was chocolate. One last thing: my friend who came in early, as well as myself, and another person from the party requested seperate checks (to the host, manager, and server). Once that time came our server Shey acted as if it was the end of his cheesecakefactory career to split the checks. Now, I have served tables for over 6 years, I get it, it sucks and its a lot of trouble to do, BUT we were are party of 12 from the ages of 23-30!! We all have jobs and proper morale to know how to TIP SUFFICIENTLY if that's what the server was worried about. Well anyway to wrap it up, this cheesecake (and most likely others) have lost a customer due to terrible service, lack of priority, and because they disregarded each request I had. For a place that you can easily spend 500$ on a full course meal, I suggest going to a mom and pop bar before experience this mess of a business.

Jun C.,"New York, NY",25,173,107,3.0,2/12/2015,"People like making jokes about the Cheesecake Factory, but the food here is actually pretty good.  In fact, despite its status as a chain, it serves better quality food than a lot of the independent, classy restaurants you may find in the American suburbs.   Food: Taste is obviously the most important aspect of a restaurant, and most of the food items that I have tasted at The Cheesecake Factory have been excellent.  Two other big reasons why I like this franchise is 1) the quantity, and 2) the range of choices.  The Cheesecake Factory is famous for having absurdly huge portions for all of their meals.  I would consider myself a fatty when it comes to food, but even I don't have a high success rate here when it comes to finishing my meal in one sitting.  Also, it's great that the menu here is so varied, and gives us a wide array of different foods to choose from.  A personal favorite of mine, which I'm admittedly embarrassed as a grown man to order, is the ""Cajun Chicken Littles"" lol.  They are essentially chicken fingers, but with Cajun seasoning and spice on the thing layer of breading, with very tender white meat on the inside.  Another good one is the ever popular dish, the ""Bang Bang Chicken."" Decor:   I like how this place is set up.  There are plenty of tables and the restaurant is very big, but the tables are separated by booths and barriers so that despite the large number of customers, it still to a degree feels like a private experience, and doesn't feel all that like you're sitting in a giant room with strangers.  They also keep the lights dimmed throughout most of the day, and the dark yellow/orange/brown colors make it so that it looks even darker than it is.  This dim lighting, combined with the comfy cushioned seats and the massive amount of food, admittedly makes me tired every time I'm here.  I just want to curl up in a ball and go to sleep haha.   Service: I haven't had any complaints about the service here at all.  Every server and employee that I have interacted with here has been incredibly friendly and helpful.  The wait time for the food is never too long, but the waiters and waitresses will still come by often to check up on you and bring you drink refills before you can even ask for them.  They also keep the bowl of bread full as well.   Overall, I can see why The Cheesecake Factory franchise is so widespread and still seemingly thriving.  Don't let the fact that it's a chain prevent you from trying out the food, which is very reliable and tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=160

Sean C.,"New York, NY",219,218,367,3.0,5/29/2015,I came in for lunch and decided to sit at the bar since I was alone and like the interaction with the bartender.  The moment I sat down the bartender welcomed me and asked if I wanted something to drink.  After that he asked if I was going to dine in which I said yes he put down a setting.  The order was taken and the food came out in under five minutes.  The food was good and my glass of water was never left empty as I kept getting refills.  Overall this was a good experience and I'll be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=160
Emmie G.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",1,11,13,1.0,9/11/2015,"Not worth the $70 bill we got AT ALL. The chicken Alfredo- one note, one color. I couldn't believe it. I thought it was a mistake. No green garnish, no tomatoe, watery cheese sauce, just all white pasta and cheese. Extremely bland cheese at that. So bad that I couldn't make myself eat the whole thing. I just ate the chicken.  For $19.50, higher than most places,  I was pissed. The Passion Fruit ice tea had no passion. I don't know how they made it but it was VERY bitter and had no fruit taste at all. Had to put about 6-8 packs of sugar to get it to taste somewhat good but then got a s u gar rush to the head after 3 packs. So headache, bad dinner, stomach ache. The cheese and bacon tots tasted terrible. There was creamy, watery cheese inside :-( My husband's fries were stiff and practically stale. The carrot cake is dry, doesn't use the traditional icing. Moreso got strings of carrots and nuts than cake batter. :-( Only good thing: Lemonade, mozzarella appetizer, cheeseburger. Serve and hostess was good and very polite.

Even the salads are colossal. But the dressings are packed with flavor and probably lots of calories too so ask for it on the side because they really pour it on if you don't. The cheesecake slices are humungous so share with someone .... or be a glutton. Whatever the case, the cheesecake is yummy but super sweet.

They have a huge menu where everyone is bound to find something that they like. Its always busy at this location and there is always a wait. This time around we waited for 1.5 hours - which sounds like a long time but with the mall next door you just put your name in and then do some shopping in the mean time. This place will NOT blow you away but it's still a good place. However the service the last few times just SUCKS! Our waiter only stopped by to bring us drinks, our food, and then the check. He never asked us if we wanted another drink, or anything else. He could have probably doubled his check if he had done so. Dinner was about 2 hours long, not because we ate or drank that much but just because of the super slow service.

We then got two slices of cake: Chocolate cheesecake with Tuxedo Cream and a slice of Red velvet - both were outstanding. The coffee was really good too. Our waiter Mike was on point and never missed a beat.  The wait was short [about 20 min] and well worth it. I recommend that you come here for a late lunch to avoid the busy crowds at night.

Harvey A.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",254,207,336,5.0,9/9/2012,"I've been loving this Cheesecake Factory for years. Let me put it another way - since the Thai Lettuce Wrap app was $9.99, but is now $12.99. That's awhile.  To fully appreciate the Cheesecake Factory you need to follow a few tips:  1) Sit in the bar area - it's less noisy and crowded, has more efficient service, and TVs for sports. 2) The menu is humongous, so let your server help - figure out what you're in the mood for and let the server make recommendations. You'll save lots of time and energy. 3) Portions are large, so share apps and don't eat all of your meal - otherwise you won't have room for cheesecake. 4) Get cheesecake! But first carefully look over your options by going to the cheesecake display counter and fully peruse the selections. It's life changing. Then consult the expert - your server. It really helps. You'll learn stuff.  If you follow these simple tips you'll have a fun, enjoyable, entertaining, tasty, interesting, and fulfilling dining experience. If you don't you'll over eat and feel stuffed, uncomfortable, have no room for cheesecake (but you'll get it and eat it anyway) and then you'll fall asleep in your car and get in trouble with your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend and/or weight watcher group leader.

Might help others. So here goes: I went with some friends for dinner and our disappointment started when our waitress took forever to come over to our table. (By forevever I mean about 15 minutes to bring us our menus.) Without a hello, the waitress said, ""I'll be back to take your order."" Umm, can we order some drinks first? Guess not because she walked away and came back about 10 minutes later, she didn't say hello; just asked for our order. My friend said hello and asked her for her name, and she said ""Cece."" She quickly said, ""what can I get you."" Let me just say, she was not a nice, welcoming waitress. She was full of attitude and we couldn't understand why?! but wow, our experience just got worse. My fries came cold and sadly were burnt. I ordered just some juice and it came warm, no ice. Thankfully, our friends liked their drinks but told us their food was ""ok."" Our waitress just seem not to want to serve us even though she constantly checked on the table across from us. Huh?  Employees will make or break your business and it can effect how customers view the place and the food they eat. The evening was dissapointing and embarrassing as our friends were from out of town.

The first app came out, it was just ok not very hot but we didn't complain, it took 45 minutes for the second app to arrive and it came out cold!!! We asked our server (who was so sweet) to send it back and he did with no issue. I then ordered a second shot of patron, do you know this shot came out in a dirty glass?! I did not complain, I simply poured it into the first glass I had and took the shot, to my surprise, it was WATER!!!! Now I am livid, I called over a random server and told her about my drink and she didn't seem surprised at all. She took it away and our original sever came back with a new drink.

As long as I have living relatives, I am sure the road of my life will always lead to a Cheesecake Factory somewhere in the country. My family, and my wife's family, and most peoples' families I know, all have a special place in their heart for the Cheesecake Factory. Me, well? Not so much. I mean, as far as chain restaurants go, you can definitely get a decent meal here. Half the battle is navigating the menu, which is like a yellow pages, complete with ads and local promotions sprinkled throughout. I am a firm believer that the more items on the menu, the less spectacular the food. The Cheesecake Factory bucks that trend ever so slightly, for with literally 100+ items to choose from, you'd flat-out expect all the food to suck by my formula. But the food is OK. I have yet to find something on the menu that would give me cause to give them more than three stars, but you could certainly do worse eating elsewhere. Here's what I think MY perfect Cheesecake Factory scenario would be:   It's been a long day, say, having attended a bourbon festival with friends for hours on end. We've just gotten done telling our driver that for all the booze they had at the festival, there wasn't much food to eat, and now we're starving. And, of course we all have both feet in the bag. As we drive down the highway, we spy a Cheesecake Factory, and ask the driver to make a stop. In an unusual twist of fate, we are pleasantly surprised to find there is no wait for a table. In fact, not only is there no wait, there are no screaming children to be found anywhere. Still, we decide to eat at the bar. Once sat, we get a few more adult beverages, and then proceed to order *EVERYTHING* on the appetizer menu. We stumble out full, accompanied by the sound of our arteries hardening, and proceed back to the limo for the long ride home. We are happy. Very, very happy. We'll have to try that some time.

Raymond G.,"Manhattan, NY",127,8,,2.0,12/27/2013,"The only reason this place got 2 stars was because of the food. My friends had the macaroni and cheese burger which was amazing. It was smokey, cheesy, and very nice. I had the chicken chili which was alright. It smelled weird but it was creamy, and nice. The service? Was HORRIBLE!!  Our server was Ashely (or Ashlee) it's Friday night and I understand it's busy I work in hospitality but this is completely unacceptable. When we got to our table, it was dirty. We had to ask the table to be cleaned. Then it took forever for the bread to come. We had to ask for straws for our water, rarely was our table asked if we were doing fine. When our entrees came we were happy! :) then my friends asked for water (there were 3 of us) and they both got their waters refilled but my cup was empty and she just kept moving? It's an industry standard to refill a guest water WITHOUT asking. My friends shouldn't have even asked for THEIR water to be refilled.  I wouldn't come here on a Friday. My friend (who was with us tonight) said she came on a Saturday and it was seamless service.  I'm not overreaching here, these are just regular industry standards. I love to tip my server and I have friends who are servers so I get it. It's hard but dirty table? And dirty floor? How clean can everything else be? I wouldn't waste my time but I'm sure others have had a great time. It was honestly just our server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=220

The tuna slices were sad looking, and the vinaigrette on the salad was a little over powering.  Bad food seemed to be the theme of the evening.  The table to my left sent back their appetizers, and the table to the side of us sent back one of their entrees..

Service is hit or miss-just depends on who you get and the mood they are in. The wait is ridiculous and I always find myself asking why I choose to wait an hour and a half to be sat for dinner. I guess it's not the restaurants fault-people like it and show up to eat-but perhaps they should expand the seating area or have a lobby where you can order appetizers while you wait.  So my experiences here have always been a 50/50. If the food is good, the service is not. I usually find the servers to be absent more than they should be during the course of the meal.

Jim U.,"Washington, DC",667,1303,3041,3.0,4/30/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory makes my very short list of chain restaurants that don't suck.  It's not fine dining, but if you are stuck in a homogenized, American suburb somewhere, this is the place you should probably choose. This particular location was rather large.  The very high ceilings and outdoor seating only increased the effect.  It is so refreshing to eat outside of the city, because you can easily find a table with plenty of room around you and not have people sitting so close by.  In short, it was relaxing. The menu was ridiculously long.  They have specialties that number into the hundreds, I dare say.  Being Easter Sunday, I thought I would try for something with ham in it, but no such luck.  Out of all the very many selections, they don't do ham steak, even on Easter.  Oh well, a passing thought really.  I decided to settle in on the shrimp and chicken gumbo (1530 calories).  The dish had so much color.  There was a large mound of white rice in the middle surrounded by a soupy gumbo.  There was plenty of nicely cooked shrimp, green onions, and tomatoes, but no sign of any chicken.  There was trace amounts of andouille sausage, but it did not have much flavor.  Overall, it was okay.  The dish had a lot of flavor, but it wasn't seasoned as nearly as heavily as I would have liked for a gumbo.  The portion size was more than fair for the price though.     I did stick around for dessert and stayed for the obligatory cheesecake.  Another long menu was presented to me.  I opted for the Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake (1330 calories).  This particular cheesecake has the dubious honor of having the most calories out of any of the selections at Cheesecake Factory.  Lucky me.  At least it was pretty good though.  It couldn't have been larger really.  It had just about everything in it too.  There was cake, fudge, peanut butter, cheesecake, a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream, and so forth.  It was a sinfully delicious way to shorten my lifespan, really.  I loved it.  Outside of New York City, I would probably rely on the Cheesecake Factory for my cheesecake indulgences, because they actually are pretty good at it.   4 stars for the cheesecake 3 stars for the food 3.5 stars overall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=240

Margherita pizza and interaction with the manager, not great. The pizza was dry and tasteless, if you want similar ingredients order the Flat Bread with cheese, tomato and basil-very tasty. We ordered Ultimate Margaritas not too much ice (hate when drinks get watery), these are normally delicious. Drinks arrived in the smallest daiquiri glasses we've ever seen so we asked the server if this was the correct drink and she stated we ordered regular, not Ultimate Margaritas as we have in the past. She offered to exchange the drinks. The manager then came to our table to ask what the problem was. He proceeded to explain that when you order a drink with less ice, you get a glass that is not filled, just as ordering a soda with less ice you will get less soda. We were shocked he came over as this was already resolved. We explained that we know what to expect when limiting ice as we always order drinks this way so they don't get watery and we ordered this very drink a week prior at Cheescake. We further explained that the issue was a regular not an Ultimate was ordered. He said okay and again mentioned the glasses would not be filled. Ultimately, the Ultimate Margaritas arrived with not limited ice but only 2 ice cubes and warm...SMH.

Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,2.0,7/17/2012,"First of all, this mall is in serious need of a few hundred more parking spaces. Good luck finding one when it's busy. Rather than wait for a table here, because there always seems to be an evening wait, I opted for takeout. Their website advertises a seamless curbside experience, but this requires a phone call to notify them you've arrived. And that'll only happen if you've managed to actually find a space in a ""designated pick up spot"". I waited a solid 10 minutes (the max limit for the pickup spots) but NO ONE left or came outside during that time frame. Fed up & impatient, I parked on the opposite side of the mall. Sure, you can have someone wait in the car for you right at the front, but in my opinion the narrow road makes navigating around your car a little difficult for other drivers. When I've dined in I've always thought the atmosphere is noisy, the tables are cramped, the table service is not bad, but not very good either, with the exception of those behind the takeout counter. They've got it down pat. Drinks & desserts could be worth the rare visit for me, but not the food. With an endless menu, much of it tastes mass produced to me, like cafeteria food. You're lucky if you choose wisely because it's a hit or miss list of stuff.

Food: 3/4 stars Everything was pretty tasty. The appetizers and cheesecakes in particular are delicious. Our main complaint was the ""grilled mahi mahi special."" The dish came with two small pieces of fish, while the other 2/3 of our $21.95 plate was mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli (most which were yellowing and looked unfresh). The fish tasted OK, and was only slightly better after slathered with lemon sauce. Do not recommend this dish in particular. Value: 2 stars Portions are large, but still way overpriced.

The Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon was juicy soaked in lemon sauce with 3-4 pieces of asparagus and a big heaping of mashed potatoes and with a side of shrimp scamipi, if you pick the combo for an extra dollar.

Food-wise, I ordered the lunch carbonara but it didn't quite do it for me. I kept thinking about the pasta carbonara I had at another restaurant in Central NJ the whole entire time and how I wish I were eating that one instead. It might be because the carbonara at the other restaurant was made with prosciutto which made it more tasty but here at the Cheesecake Factory they just use tiny bacon flakes. I would skip this next time and suggest to the restaurant to consider putting prosciutto in their carbonara dishes because it would be a wonderful improvement. The peppery-ness of the lunch carbonara here was good though, keep that. I'm giving this review 4 stars despite so-so carbonara because of the service I received from my waiter today.

Tessa L.,"Jersey City, NJ",16,93,3,3.0,1/15/2013,"So I went here 3 days ago on a Saturday for my birthday with a party of 5 total. The wait time alone was 75 minutes. We stood in the vestibule all that time. Mind you, im not a fan of chain restaurants, but Ive heard a lot about the CF and decided to give it a whirl for my special occasion. The good: cheesecake in all varieties. I had the tiramisu cheesecake and it was a generous slice of deliciousness! The menu items are reasonably priced between $9-30. The bad (brace yourself): The food! I had the steak Diane & Salmon combo. My steak was overcooked for being medium well. Both meats were bland. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were the only tasty items on my plate. My sister's Bang Bang chicken looked and tasted  like regurgitated indian food. Yuck! The plates are huge, the tables are small. Thats a recipe for an accident. My mom spilled her larger than life glass of coke and it shattered all over the floor. Another  table, 2 booths away also smashed glass like they were at a Greek wedding. The frozen drinks come non-alcoholic yet were tasty. All in all, the food was not worth the time nor money spent.

I had a Santa Fe salad, which was as yummy and huge (I only was able to finish half of it) as I remember it being from years past, and my mom had some shrimp pasta dish which I think she enjoyed, since there was none left on her plate. She tried to get me to order a slice of cheesecake so that she could have a ""bite"" but I'm not a cheesecake fan at all, so we just had some coffee.

It's hard, but it's worth it The menu is massive, if you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. There's room for full-page ads on it. It's a book of food selection, totalling at around 15 pages. My Smokehouse BBQ Burger was above average. Not bad at all, but not absolutely amazing. It was a solid burger, though. The fries came in a little can, which was cute. Another person ordered the pizza, and was left a little disappointed due to its sogginess and the incredibly thin (and soggy) crust. The Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae was heavenly, but I could only finish half of it lest I burst in an explosion of calories and sugar. The other people at my table ordered the Hershey's cheesecake and the Strawberry Shortcake. They enjoyed their desserts as well. Oh, and the parking can get crazy.

I ordered a small Greek salad and the soft shrimp tacos.  There was more feta on the salad than I'd gotten at a diner for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  And the tacos were surprisingly tasty; a bit of a kick, served with lime wedges and a decent (tho' not fresh) salsa.  The ersatz Mexican rice had peas & corn in it, not great but passable.  Can't complain, for the price($12.95)! My mother-in-law didn't like any of the menu options, so we asked the server if she could have just plain grilled shrimp with some sides.  She was very agreeable, saying that their menu is so vast that they can meet almost any special request.  So Mom received 4 (5?) grilled shrimp, with a large portion of mashed potatoes that she loved, and a good-sized portion of steamed fresh broccoli. My husband enjoyed his grilled fish tacos, served with a side of rice and black beans. Did I mention that each of the tacos had a slice of avocado on it also?

Dishes I really like generally include most of the salad dishes because I was on a 'diet' for a really long time: 1.  Chinese chicken salad  2.  Cobb salad - yes, I know, still fattening but the fiber .... 3.  The combination appetizer plate is great for sharing and trying items that you may not order on your own like the corn cakes (yummy but small) and crab cakes mixed in with the run of the mill buffalo wings, mozzerella sticks. There are definitely one or two dishes that I did not like, including the salad with gouda and pear.  I had this in Wayne and literally asked the waitress where the pear was?  She was pretty snooty and told me that there were (obviously miniscule) pieces of diced dry pear in the salad.  Righhhhhhhht.  If the taste is THAT subtle, why the heck headline it in the description?!?!?!? Generally, all of the cheesecakes are delicious, but the challenge is in finding the room after eating dinner.  The low carb cheesecake is okay but I like stuff on mine and this was a plain version.  Could never get myself to try the fish tacos but I hear that is really good too. I like two of the drinks:  the well mannered dirty martini with extra olives (they're huge and stuffed with bleu cheese) and the candy apple martini (very girly and with red sugar on the rim).  My only issue is that I always get extra olives with the dirty martini and the last time the bartender wanted to CHARGE for them .... WTF?  BTW, I asked about buying a bottle and the waitress told me that the CF workers stuff the olives themselves.

Since I wasn't really hungry, I tried to be somewhat healthy and opted for the fire roasted artichoke w/two dipping sauces - garlic aioli and some spicy vinegarette.  The artichoke was ok.. there wasn't really enough plant meat on it for it to be worth getting.. one thing I learned though you can dip a shoe in garlic aioli and it'll taste delicious.

Jadean F.,"Burbank, CA",0,21,,1.0,11/14/2009,"I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factories over the years, so I'm pretty familiar with their menu, layout, and service. I thought it was pretty standard. However, my recent trip made me belive that service, food quality isn't standard even at fairly large chains. First of all, our waitress was horrible. She was one of those chatty people who end up going on a tangent and forgetting everything you asked for before she started talking, venting, and shooting the breeze.  For example: I asked for the ""brown bread."" She went on for eight minutes about all the names she's heard the bread called. Toward the end of her rant, I repeated that we only wanted the honey wheat bread. I didn't want to waste food. Fifteen minutes later she comes back with one slither of honey wheat and two sourdough rolls. Of course we didn't eat them. We asked for the honey wheat again. Then we asked for it three more times before she ever brought it out. When we finally got the bread, she brought out five pieces right before our meal...this was pointless. We no longer wanted the bread. Now we wanted lemon for our water. We had asked for that in the beginning as well.  Clearly, this was starting to feel like work... We sat in the back of the restaurant where it was supposed to be quieter. Until little Mr. Terror sat down with his mom and grandmother. This child was unruly and promptly began throwing objects i.e. a cell phone toward our table. Our waitress decided to go into babysitting mode and began mimicking the child's annoying squeal every single time she passed his table (which unfortunately happened to be across from ours). I ordered fish tacos with black beans, yellow rice, and guacamole. My mother order the chicken and biscuits. I usually order the shrimp club sandwich.  When my fish tacos arrived, I could tell the plate had been through hell. The rice was clearly overcooked. The black beans were overcooked. But worst of all, when I went to put my fork into the black beans, I saw the half of a french fry. It made me sick. It really made me wonder what was really going on in that kitchen. These are not the thoughts you want to have while dining out. You could tell that the ""chefs"" back there could careless. I immediately called my waitress over. In her typical unprofessional fashion, she began to try to explain why my plate looked like a Bottom Chef disaster. ""Your rice was probably overcooked because they didn't bring it out right away. It usually sits under the lights. Yeah that is a french fry. It probably dropped over from another plate. Your tacos seem ok. Want me to love those on the plate?""  Um, no.  At that point my mind started to imagine all kinds of things. I really didn't want to order anything else . I wanted to get out of there. However, I didn't want to make my mother feel bad while she was attempting to eat. So I went back to my trusty shrimp sandwich. To her credit, she did tell the manager. He came over with an apology. He validated my complaints and said that this was unacceptable. He told me he would watch my sandwich. This made me really uncomfortable about that kitchen once again. The sandwich came out fifteen minutes later. It was cooked to perfection. However, the belligerent toddler was back to throwing items. All I really wanted to do was leave and forget I ever showed up here. The manager should have comped us for at least a dessert for the inconvenience. The waitress should have been more professional and focused. The parents of Mr. Terror should go home and pray for mercy. They really shouldn't take him out in public until his behavior is under control.

Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,4.0,6/5/2009,"I'm definitely a fan of the cheesecake factory. The appetizers and entrees are definitely very yummy, and if I gain a few pounds from the huge portions... well it's worth it! Appetizers: I like the Ahi Tuna and the pot stickers. Since the entrees are so large, I generally do not get an appetizer. Entrees: I generally get the beef ribs. The ribs are huge (they are beef, after all) and the meat is so tender that it falls right off the bone. The BBQ flavor tastes like it's been slowly cooked in, and I only wish I had enough room left over for the sides that come w/ the dish. The burger is also a must try. They put hand battered onion rings into the burger so you get a bit of a crunchy texture as you bite in. The burger is also quite large such that it is usually pretty difficult to finish everything.  The hibachi steak is usually very tender with a light sauce. Not my favorite, but still very enjoyable.  Desserts: I ALWAYS get the chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake is fantastic, very moist with 4 or 5 layers of very rich chocolate icing. You get this HUGE slice, and with the ice cream and whipped cream, it is decadent. That being said, I've tried their cheesecake and was not very impressed. The price is quite reasonable given the large portions and the tasty food. Also, as an ""up scale restaurant"" an entree that runs you $15 to $30 is really not that bad. My only issue is that they do not take reservations, which means that you will be waiting at least an hour (if not longer) to be seated on a Friday or Saturday night. At least it's located as part of the riverside mall so you do have the option of browsing the surrounding shops (not that many) while waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=360

Typically if the place is packed this is understandable, but when they start sitting groups (of the same number of people) that came in after us there is a problem. Our extra wait was due to having small children with us. In my opinion this is unacceptable. My children are very well behaved, even with a hour and a half of wait.

Today, I decided to come here with a couple of friends of mine. Usually, were used to crappy service.. sadly most restaurants will treat us like crap due to our age because they'll assume that we'll give them a horrible tip due to being teenagers. This service was beyond horrible. We started out our stay with a waiter who told us that she'd be starting us out but they were under shift changes so our new waiter would be taking our order afterwards. After thirty or so minutes we finally got fed up and had to ask someone to bring us a waiter. She brought us our food but didn't come back until another thirty or so minutes to check on us and at that point we hadn't even ordered our dinner yet. We were fed up and eventually got to order our food and eat.   Once we were done we paid for our check and waited to get my friend's card back, but we never did.

Brian V.,"Bergenfield, NJ",3,24,,4.0,1/22/2012,"My rule of thumb applies specifically to this place. Rule of thumb states that if a place is packed at lunch or diner than they are doing something right. If you don't want to wait and hour to sit down and eat than quit squawking and go somewhere else, i mean really its that simple.  .          My favorites are the kobe burger the navajo sandwich and just about any salad on the menu they are large very large. Stay away from there steaks they are a bit pricey and a little small for the coin your shelling out for them not to mention they just aren't that good. The selection of cheesecakes to choose from is quite nice and the portion is quite nice also. If your a fan of carrot cake or strawberry shortcake i would recommend them also the the slices are huge.     I have never had a problem with the service here it has always been excellent the place gets really really busy so if your waiter isn't back in 2 shakes of a lambs tail with drink refills or something extra take it easy and enjoy the scenery.Come to this place early for lunch on the weekend 11:30 to 1 if you dont want to wait to long.If your gonna get your panties in an uproar b/c you don't get seated right of way at 6:00 pm on a fri sat sun than do yourself a favor and go someplace else. It cracks me up how people call this a chain restaurant your not gonna get food like this at tgi fridays or applebees so its really not fair to compare them to those types of low standard eateries.

And by all means, eat there, but know how they conduct business. A friend who works there informs me that longterm staff with health insurance and higher hourly wages at her location are being frozen out with reduced hours, or baited so they'll quit or get themselves fired. She says the general manager has frequently talked openly about the fact that he will not keep people on staff who make a higher wage, and people who work at other locations say the same thing goes on there. By the way, at this location, hosts and cooks receive a regular hourly wage, but servers, bussers, and bartenders basically work for tips, because by law the Cheesecake Factory only has to pay them $2.15 an hour as long as that plus their tips adds up to $7.95, or minimum wage...but if their tips don't make minimum wage (if for example they work slow shifts and don't get seated) the Cheesecake Factory forces them to declare, and therefore pay taxes on, more tips than they made.

Mark N.,"Point Pleasant Beach, NJ",46,196,177,4.0,5/7/2009,"If you're looking for great food, you have to check this place out at least once. Situated in the Riverside Square Mall, this restaurant has great food with huge portions (not for the faint of heart). My personal favorite is the Steak Diane - great mashed potatoes. They have a nice beer menu, one of the few restaurants I know of that serves Sierra Nevada. If you're a health nut or on weight watchers, you probably will want to steer clear of this place - it's not exactly the healthiest. For the few of us with great metabolisms, you'll leave VERY full. This is not a place for those with tight budgets - I've easily spent over $100 for two, many times (not that there's anything wrong with that, but it will hurt if you're college age). As the name suggests, this place is famous for serving two menu pages worth of cheesecake slices; it would be sacrilege not to order something from it before you leave.  As for the negative: parking for Cheesecake Factory in Riverside Square sucks, for lack of a better term. Don't even think of getting a spot outside of the restaurant (unless you want to battle maniacs who are willing to sit around for 30 minutes and wait for spots to free up), but look toward the parking lot around the corner. For some reason, there is a never ending amount of people coming to Riverside Square for reasons I can't explain. You'll probably want to order some kind of appetizer right off the bat, since the food can take awhile to be prepared - I don't blame the cooks, it's mostly because this place is swamped with customers on a regular basis. There's also a full bar near the entrance. The wait time at Cheesecake Factory is usually long. Expect a good half hour or more on average, far more than that on a Saturday night - or simply don't bother on a Saturday night. In short - great but pricey food, bad parking, long wait time.

However the parking is just ridiculous due to the mall and like 6 other restaurants. There's only 6 parking spots! (exaggerating) but I did have to park pretty far. So we were seated and greeted. The waitress was very pleasant and attentive, no problems with her or any staff at all. Ordered the calamari app and it was great, lightly fried to perfection although to me it seemed like the portion had gotten smaller since I was there last. I had the Steak Diane and the ever so popular Chicken Madeira combination. To be honest I didn't like either all that much, the steak was definitely not seasoned, it was obvious they just cooked it and poured the sauce over top. Ive had this steak here before and it wasn't nearly as bad. Now the chicken I didn't like all that much either but I think that was due to preference bc the gf loved it. It was just to sweet for me. She had the Chicken Castelleta and that was better than both my chicken and steak. It was lightly breaded and cooked well. Actually despite the taste (of my dish) everything was cooked perfectly. The strawberry lemonade is goooood too. And finally, you need the Red Velvet Cheesecake in your life... WoW, I don't even know anyone else who even makes this, but they DO, and they do very well.

Almost every single time we went there, we are in-and-out in one hour and first half hour is spent in the waiting area. So the average dining duration is only half an hour and I hate that.

Jessica F.,"New York, NY",87,252,49,3.0,8/1/2007,"Oh my god, spare me the snotty elitist attitude about popular chain restaurants.  I love it when people have to hate the big guy when all he is is big.  I will grant you, Cheesecake Factory isn't a fine dining restaurant, but there is nothing wrong with it--it is a lot of fun, the food is decent, and you wind up with leftovers.  And excuse me--you think you can get a better meal at Houston's than you can at Cheesecake Factory?  Please.  It's practically the same menu--steaks, salads, cheesy goopy appetizers.   I keep saying this--it's all about managing expectations.  It isn't McCormick and Schmick.  It's a loud, fun, busy, tasty place.  That's it.  If you don't want to wait, there are a number of other restaurants now at the Shops at Riverside, a new addition to the mall with Maggiano's Little Italy, PF Chang's Bistro, Rosa Mexicano and other similar high-quality chains.  If you do want to wait--and you will--they hand out beepers, so you can head into the Barnes and Noble next door, or head into Bloomingdales, also next door.   I have come to this location of CF at least ten times since it opened about ten years ago, with crowds, with family, and alone, and it never fails to satisfy.  If you like bargains, this is the place for you.  If you like abundance, this is the place for you.  If you like variety, this is the place for you.  I didn't realize that tourists patronized Riverside Square Mall, but I guess if you live in Nyack, you could be considered a tourist, if you come to avoid sales tax on clothes and stop off for a salad before heading back to the Palisades Parkway. I will say the cocktails are pretty bad.  As did other Yelpers, I also ordered a strawberry martini.  It's vile.  Don't do it.   The latest thing they offer is small plates of some of their most popular dishes at the bar from 4-6 PM at reduced prices.  Caesar salad was substantial, garlicky and $2.95.  Three sizeable balls of fried mac and cheese on a bed of pink sauce was $3.95.  Ahi tuna tempura roll was tasty, light and yet filling, and was $4.95.  A reasonable way to try a number of dishes and not get enormously stuffed.  Also, no leftovers.   Personally, I think while $6.50 for the 6-carb cheesecake is a little steep, when you throw in a slice of carrot cake so big and dense and intimidating you need to invite people to eat it with you for $6.50, it all evens out. Yes, it's a chain.  So is everything else these days.  The thing about Cheesecake Factory is that the food tastes like it has a point of view.  I don't feel like I am going to hell for eating there.   Everything doesn't have to be a new culinary adventure and a flirtation with a violent bout of food poisoning to keep me feeling vibrant and alive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=380

I have stopped coming here - just thinking about the huge portions makes me want to gag. No wonder America is so fat. The oily pasta makes me want to go on a diet and the entree's started to have a similar taste?!  I have tried the meatloaf, sheperd's pie, steak diane, roasted chicken, chicken marsala, chicken picatta, louisiana pasta, chicken romano, nachos, taquitos, salads, sandwiches, cheesecake, etc.!!! God, thinking about it makes me wanna puke!!! The dessert counter in front of the restaurant is evil.  You pack on 10lbs just starting into the hypnotizing glass of cheesecakes.  I don't care for them, actually.  They are too sweet and the only one I usually order is the Keylime or regular cheesecake with strawberries. The restaurant is so dark it makes me wonder what it would look like with the lights on?!  Probably sticky tables and floors *quivers* This place is packed on the weekends so if you have at least and hour to kill - by all means, wait otherwise I don't know what else to tell ya!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hackensack?start=380

Two apps were more than enough food for two hungry ladies, but as expected, I was less than impressed with either of them. The buffalo blasts were basically fried dough with a little bit of chicken and the egg rolls were supposed to have this avo cream salsa with them that basically tasted like green mayo. Speaking of the egg rolls, they were like all onions. It's just like... is this really the best the suburbs have to offer? They also insist on playing music even though the place is so loud you can hardly hear the Blues Traveler & Matchbox 20. Of course I was able to pick them out since that is the fine music of my fine generation.

First off my salad, was just horrible, i don't know if it was the dressing, veggies, or both but i took one bite and just but that aside. Then came my pizza, it really greasy and really salty. I was pretty disappointed. My sister's shrimp with angel hair was a fail too. She said it just did not taste good, and she ended up leaving most of it too.  And our server took forever to come around with our check and refills and such. It was a busy because of it being lunch time, but the quality of food and slow service, makes me not want to come back. I want to like cheesecake factory, i really do, but I always choose the wrong item and end up being really disappointed. The only thing that redeems Cheesecake factory is their cheesecake, my recent favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Its Cheesecake and red velvet cake in one.

I came here with my mom and grandma and a hate for cilantro runs in our family. We ordered our food and asked our waiter to make sure there was no cilantro in anything. A few minutes later, he came back and told us that the fish tacos that my mom had ordered has cilantro in the salsa. So, without any problems, we told him we'll just take the salsa on the side. When the tacos came out, we noticed that there was cilantro not only inside but sprinkled on top. We asked the waiter to take it back so, he did. Then, he came back with the same plate (although it looked like the cilantro was picked off a little bit) and said that it was parsley. No. It was still cilantro. A lot of it. We didn't even bother sending it back because the kitchen staff refused to take responsibility. This is nothing on the waiter - he was very nice... well, maybe it's on him a little but, mostly the kitchen staff.
