7,Michelle E.,"San Jose, CA",2,12,7.0,4.0,2014-11-16,"Late night half off appetizers! We were looking for a spot to grab some snacks and drinks Saturday night, and this worked out great. Very friendly servers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
6,Doug H.,"Indianapolis, IN",8,12,2.0,2.0,2015-02-06,"I brought my blind friend here for lunch and they didn't have any menus in Braille.  I figured by them being a chain restaurant, they would have these available. I guess the ADA doesn't apply to them?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
0,Kevin C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,48,65.0,5.0,2015-08-13,"Over the years I've eaten here dozens of times. I live locally. Generally when I read Yelp reviews I think it's unfair for a person to expect perfection from a restaurant and then post negatively when their expectations fall short.  First of all, this is Applebees. It's not a gourmet New York restaurant or a trendy California cafe. So if you're expecting an Applebees type experience you'll be pleased. They've had consistently good food and service. The wait staff is well trained and management is on top of things.  Today I told the server that I drink a lot of tea. She brought me two right away, which I appreciate. ( I eat out for lunch nearly daily and this place does better than others at keeping drinks filled).  Speaking of tea, years ago when my wife and I came here every Monday for lunch my wife was on a restricted diet and couldn't have caffeine. But she loved tea. When the manager learned of this he acquired decaf tea just to have on hand for my wife. That manager is still here and just as considerate as before. You don't get that type of consideration everywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
3,Terry Y.,"Loogootee, IN",0,36,44.0,5.0,2016-07-22,Great service and great food. Everything was amazing. Love the chicken & Mac & Cheese was awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
5,Eddie F.,"Fairview Heights, IL",26,23,,1.0,2016-08-05,"I try to give every establishment the 3 strike rule.  And for Applebee's they struck out.  First occasion the appetizers were obviously cooked in advance to prepare for the dinner rush because they were not only cold but stale.  My 2nd attempt was at the entree, the fish were obviously deep fried twice.  I assume this because I spent 5 years as a cook and I've ran into twice cooked fish and chips before.  My final attempt was on 8-5-2016.  I typically understand that steak can be a tough meat if not aged or prepared properly.  They consistency of the pepper steak was that of cheap bubblegum. And words can't describe that unless you're using top shelf tequila a margarita is never $9.  On top of all that we had to drink from Styrofoam cups and eat our appetizers off napkins.  While they didn't have the employees to bus and wash there were 5 uniformed workers out back yelling and smoking.  The management of this establishment is in need of serious renovation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
4,Kevin-and D.,"Indianapolis, IN",43,3,,1.0,2016-09-04,Worst service ever. Pretty sure the hostess was high. Our server never even introduced herself. She never offered refills unless we flagged her down even though it was obvious we needed them.The food was decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
2,Jeff C.,"Bloomington, IN",0,3,,1.0,2017-07-25,"A horrible experience as far as food goes. Greasy fried fish, liquid Tartar sauce, hardened and chewy mozzarella sticks, gristly dried out steak on salad, inedible cole slaw, overly peppered chimichurri making food inedible. The waiter was cocky and insincere, and seemed to delight in his schtick. The whole thing stunk of s badly managed restaurant with an incompetent and unsanitary kitchen. So gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
1,Kimberly G.,"Columbia, IL",28,9,1.0,1.0,2017-10-16,If I could give zero stars I would.  I came in and ordered a Thai Chicken Salad. Only to find after a few bites a nut and washer in my salad!  No kidding!!  I took a photo of it!!  I told the server and she seemed embarrassed and went in the kitchen.  She came back out later and snatched the plate from me.  Ten minutes later some guy came out who didn't identify himself and spoke real low.  Told me he had no idea how that would have got in there.  Said we will take care of your meal and then left.   That was it.  Seriously.  Did not swan apologetic or sorry at all.  I literally just got up and left.  Still hungry wondering where the damn nut went and if I had ingested that part!!!   Terrible!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jasper-3,,,,,
