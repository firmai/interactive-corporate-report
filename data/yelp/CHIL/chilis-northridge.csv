Jess M.,"Rosemead, CA",7,26,27,4.0,12/13/2017,"This is one of our favorite workday lunch spots and happy hours for around four years now! The manager, Alex, is the main reason we keep coming back. He knows how to take care of customers, he trains his staff well on customer service. The current wait staff & bartenders are good! (There have been a few bad ones in the past.) There's a nice, chill vibe in the restaurant so it always feels good hanging out there. Great place for a group party or a big family meal together! Never once have I or my coworkers had any complaints about the food. I like the smokehouse combo with ribs, sausage, fries and elote, the steak plate, sliders, tortilla soup, and many of the other appetizers. I mean, it's a chain restaurant, so it's not the best steak in my life, but it's always cooked right and delicious. I'd have to say that the best thing is that the food is consistent-- I can count on ordering my favorites and they'll come out as good as last time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge
Alfredo R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,43,4,1.0,12/10/2017,"Arrived around 7ish pm on 12/9/17. The wait time was 5 minutes (not bad) . Was seated and ordered drinks. Ordered the side table guacamole and first of all it didn't have ANY flavor , it didn't have cheese and it wasn't  spicy .. $10 bucks for this no thanks. Then the food came out, I got the 3 combination fajitas which have steak, chicken and shrimp. The only bad thing was the steak it tasted like rubber (how does that even taste like?)...  Now the Service was just awful , didn't get refills when asked for one. Asked for a box to go and had to wait literally 10-15 minutes. I ended up leaving a half plate of fajitas since I just got so frustrated with their service. This is not worth coming to , I expect to be treated better than this since I'm the one paying for their services and their food they advertise all over television . Only reason I came because it played a commercial on television and on an empty stomach it hit me... Sadly I won't be coming to this chili's location or any other one in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge
Erix V.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,45,22,1.0,11/28/2017,"SO DISAPPOINTING. I always go to this location (in person) and they treat us so well. Usually I have nothing to say. But we JUST ordered this place to deliver thru postmates and I'm sad.. a little angry... but mostly disappointed because we always order this and today we received nothing of the norm. First of all there was a missing item: our prized loaded mashed potatoes. The pasta was dry, her mango Chile chicken was dry and overall, this was not a meal that was worth the $27 spent (see pictures). It's sad, too.... I actually love Chili's... especially this one. Maybe it's because they didn't see us face to face? If that is so, that's even worse when it comes to their work ethic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge
Sheila K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,36,2,3.0,1/14/2018,"I'm giving this place a 3 star because they didn't have wheat buns for their burgers nor did they have mushrooms for them. I mean, who doesn't have wheat buns? So my mom ended up wrwooong her burger in lettuce and it was not so good.  I had the chicken enchilada soup which is my go to choice and a house salad which you can't go wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge
Anet Y.,"Granada Hills, CA",40,52,89,5.0,12/12/2017,This is my favorite spot in the valley. There is usually a 30 minute wait on the weekends but it is worth the wait. They have great food and drinks. They have great deals for dinner. You can get appetizer and entrees for 2 only for 22 dollars or add drinks and dessert for 35 dollars. The service is always good and food is decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge
Vanessa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,52,116,4.0,3/7/2017,"First time ever going to a Chili's, and honestly.. it was okay. I would give a 3 stars if it wasn't for the waiter. I was interested in the little game pad they have on the table, and accidentally ""bought"" game sessions. I let the waiter know, and he saw that we didn't play on it, so he took off the charge. That took $4 off our total- which might not seem like much, but it is when we're paying that much for nothing. I wish I got his name, but whoever you are, thank you. You da homie. Anyway, I got the dinner meal where you get appetizers, and 2 dinner entrees for $24. Appetizer was chips with guac & salsa. Dinner was a burger and pasta. I prefer the burger over the pasta- the taste of the pasta after a while was too overwhelming. This was definitely a steal. There was enough food leftover for breakfast. Would I come back here again? Sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge
Stephanie May L.,"Granada Hills, CA",230,114,249,4.0,2/14/2017,"Love Chilis! They always have great deals. They have the 2 for 22 which includes one appetizer to share and 2 entrees. With this I am able to get a 6 oz. of steak which comes with 2 sides. There are also many choices for this deal. They also had the $10 for 3 courses which included an appetizer, entree & molten lava cake. Not sure if they still have it though. Tip: Order the molten lava cake.

Anthony M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,21,3,1.0,8/29/2017,"Fucking horrid. This place seems to have been designed for people with limited attention spans and a fear of conversation.  My new rules for happy dining out: 1) No place with screens on the fucking tables. 2) No place so loud I can't even hear myself fart. 3) No place staffed by fucking undergrads. The loud music coupled with loud conversations made for an unbearably uncomfortable evening. Food took too long to arrive, and when it did half of it was cold. I had no idea ribeye has gristle. Oh, wait. It fucking doesn't. Ordered one drink - a Margarita, easy - and it took fucking ages to arrive, and when it did it was a weak, watery disappointment. The damned thing took so long the manager made his way over, unbidden, to meekly apologise that they'd ""dropped the ball"". That was appreciated, but it wasn't enough to remedy the overall annoyance of the evening. If you're not a fan of Bros or of sticky tables and cold entrees, avoid this place like the fucking plague.

Rose N.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/22/2017,"Placed a to-go order here on Monday. Ordered the prime rib tacos for my husband, and I got the Cajon pasta. With chicken. Got home and there was no chicken on my pasta. Instead there was shrimp. Can't eat shrimp. I'm allergic. Tried one of my husband's tacos... the meat in this taco there's absolutely no resemblance the prime rib. It was completely dried out and had a horrible taste to it. Not only that we have to have a chimichurri sauce on the side. And of course it was not on the side. My husband ate the pasta and he enjoyed it. Don't get excited this man will eat anything. I can't really critique the pasta considering I couldn't eat it because it had shellfish in it. You need to pay for better attention to what you're doing with your to-go orders. Very disappointing.

Rania O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,4,1.0,9/2/2017,"This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. I ordered a simple salad and they brought me a salad that was missing most of the ingredients and had a completely different lettuce.  I told the waitress , she asked if I wanted something else. I ended up ordering the fajitas since there isn't many options for a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes ( who was starving by this time, as my parents both already finished their meals).    Finally my new meal comes and as I start eating a few bites of the veggies, there was a huge hair on the onions. Seriously, how could this even happen. I literally wanted to throw up. She took it back and apologized and had a manager come by. All he said was he was sorry and things happen. He asked if I wanted anything else, I said no. He took my meal off the bill and we were on our way. We shouldn't have paid for any of the meals after this experience but I'll choose my battles. I ended up going to habit burger and getting a salad.  Save you money and your time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge

I wasn't too excited to go there.  Zach was our waiter and he changed my mind.  He was very cheerful and smiling and did everything that needed to be done to make us happy.   The food was delicious, our orders were done right, except my fries.  Had to return them to get cooked more.  I like them x x x well done.  Most places are afraid to make them the way I like them.  When Zach brought them back, they were perfect.

Shannon O.,"Chatsworth, CA",138,2,,1.0,6/5/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE unless you want to risk eating the HAIR of someone who works here.... Absolutely horrible service and health code violations. Let me tell you about my experience.... I ordered the Prime Rib Tacos and asked to have them with the Prime Rib, jack cheese, and cilantro. Instead of beans and rice for the sides, I subbed in for fries and corn. This meal also is supposed to come with avocado slices and a salsa kind of side as well.  When my food arrived, the server who took my order, brought out a dish that had the tacos without any cilantro on them and with the beans and rice on the plate. Fries and corn weren't in sight. She took my dish back and brought the proper sides but then I realized that there were also no avocado slices or pick salsa. I was the one who had tell my server who took my order that it was wrong and ask for them to correct my plate.....TWICE. My guest was almost finished with her meal by the time my meal was corrected. Upon this happening, all the waitress did was offer a free ""mini cake"", I demanded my food be taken off our tab.  After my meal was corrected, I was enjoying my tacos which were absolutely delicious but as I reached my 3rd taco, a giant SIX INCH HAIR was dangling out of my taco! How disgusting! The manager brought me out new tacos but at that point I didn't want to eat any food that came from this place! I told the manager that I refused to pay for any of my bill including my guests bill and she agreed and said that we didn't need to pay for anything.  After this, a waitress spilled water onto the ground as it dripped down from a cup and it was never taken care of or attended to.  The ground in our section was so dirty with tons of food and crumbs under every booth.  Do not eat here!!! Your health is at risk!!! The health department has been contacted and I hope this location either majorly improves or gets shut down if things do not change.  I",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge

Kenny D.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",206,252,701,2.0,4/24/2016,"I saw that there was a deal of half rack ribs, salad, fries, and a dessert for only $11 and I just had to stop by to pick up some food.  I placed my order via their website and arrived about 5 minutes earlier than my scheduled pick up time and I was told it wouldn't be ready for another 5-10 minutes which wasn't a big deal.  About 25 minutes later my meal was finally ready. The salad could be fresher, it was pretty old and wilted.  Fries seemed like they had been sitting out for a while.  Ribs weren't that bad but they lacked the smoky taste.  I actually liked their Dr. Pepper bbq sauce but wished there was more of it.  The ""molten chocolate"" wasn't molten and had pretty much solidified, but the cake itself was good. Pretty good value for the amount of food you receive but having to wait an extra 20 minutes past my scheduled pick up time doesn't sit too well with me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge

Aleks R.,"La Puente, CA",46,22,14,2.0,2/19/2017,"Just left this location and could not believe the service I had. I've been a patron here for 6+ years and have NEVER had an issue with food, service, or anything. I LOVE this place and the only reason it isn't a one star.  Homeboy that served us was a middle aged white guy. No name tag no introduction. First he forgets our drink order after taking it, comes back and asks for our order again. When he brings our drinks out he DROPS them on the table and even managed to get mine wrong.  I'm not a complaint person so when he asks me which I prefer I go ""no problem dude"" he responds ""good because I don't feel like getting what you ordered anyways"" - that's fine I'll let it go.  Then homeboy disappears for half an hour. We tried flagging him down at least 5 times and he just stormed passed us. Finally when he decides to take our order 45 minutes after we arrive he goes ""thanks so much for being so liberal with your time.""... Really? On the plus side when I spoke to the GM Alex and he was EXTREMELY helpful. Hopefully they let this guy go or AT LEAST get his attitude in check because this really is a quality branch...

Like damn, I know food doesn't always look the same as the picture on the menu, but come on, I at least expected the plate from the picture. So I started to eat and I swear, these ribs were the most apprentice/beginners level kind of ribs I have ever tasted. They tasted like school cafeteria food. It was garbage to say the least.

The service is good,  the food is pretty decent and it's not a bad price.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and it wasn't too crowded even though this Chili's does get very crowded because it's near the CSUN, the nearby university. We noticed there's was a deal on the menu where for $35 you get an appetizer, two different entrées, two margaritas, and a choice of dessert. The only thing is you have to pick off their approved appetizers and entrées, which was a little limited.   I think the $35 deal was pretty great but only one thing was disappointing. We wanted the tableside guacamole and you cannot get this with the $35 deal. There is a deal for chips and guacamole but it's not the tableside one and includes onions and I am allergic to onions so I had to order guacamole separately which kind of sucked. So that was an extra $7.  However our waiter Mike was very nice and patient. We had some kids with us that were making quite a mess and he didn't seem to mind at all.  As for the food, we ordered the table side guacamole, which was good. The chicken fajitas which were decent, and the chicken crispers which were delicious!  We finished it off with a cookie skillet for dessert which was decent. My friend said the margaritas weren't that strong but did the trick! Lastly, Chili's has a new thing at the table that looks like a little TV. It is a little touch screen where you can order food, play games for a small fee, pay your bill and look through the menu! It's very cool!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=20

Plenty of tv's to watch whatever sports are on and even when it's full a good time is not hard to have here. I'll keep on coming here as long the doors stay open or until I tire of the ribs !!!

I had to send it back and just get fajitas. Who could mess up fajitas? It was still gross. Greasy and not good. Our server was rude. I guess to embarrassed to come back to our table... so we had another guy waiting on us he was nice but made it like he was offering me a free drink and still ended up getting charged for it!!

Happy hour is still good. The kiosks they have are awesome for easily splitting up checks. No complaints on that end. However. Of the last 4 x in the last 4 months that we have been there, on 2 visits we had a curly hair in our food and 1 time we had an actual bug. The waiter handled it well each time. Each time a manager even came out to apologize and comp the dish (not the meal) and bring out a new one. I thought that it's about as best as they can do. Can't turn back time. Can't make things un-happen. That's all they can do really. I won't knock them for that but a big part of me does not want to step foot in this particular location again. The thought that we had something 3 out of the last 4 times now all of the sudden kinda grosses me out. Something must have gone down hill overs the years. I may come here with friends if that's where we end up, but I think I'll eat before hand and just have their beers.

Angeline A.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",613,23,30,2.0,9/21/2015,"The only reason this Chili's is getting two stars is because of the company I was with. Other then that, what a horrible experience. Yesterday when we walked in we weren't greeted. The front host stand was empty, and we were just standing there looking around seeing a ton of tables open.  We ordered drinks, all of us ordered water, except my friend who ordered a Lemonade...When the server came back after a while, he brought our waters and told us that ""they were out of anything lemonade based"". Ok, great, but he left without even asking if he wanted something else instead.  We ordered the cheese fries as our appetizers, and they were pretty good.  When it was time to order our actual meal the server asked us what we wanted, everyone ordered and when I ordered the Boneless Buffalo Wings, he said ""I think we are out""...and I asked ""You think? or you know?"" & he couldn't answer... so I said ""can you find out for me please""... I felt like I was pulling teeth for information.  He came back to confirm that they were out of what I wanted and I ordered the Big Mouth Bites with fries. My friends ordered the mango talapia, a burger, and my boyfriend & I had the big mouth bites. When the runner served our food, she dropped my fries in my water -_- and laughed about it... c'mon! She didn't offer to get me a new batch, she just laughed and tried to make a joke about it. If i'm going to pay to dine out, I kind of don't want my food to be dropped into water. I didn't want to ask because, well, I felt like she should have spoken to her manager and offer something.. Everyone including myself said their food was alright, nothing special.  I used to love Chili's, but it's become a little bit over-rated.  After dinner, I ordered the Molten Lava Cake, and our server again laughed and said ""I'm sorry but we are out of that now"" and I said that I had just seen one come out 2 min ago. He said that on sunday nights they normally run out of half of the menu and not to come back during this time... Anyways I ordered the Oreo Molten Lava Cake, and OK i have to say that was DELICIOUS.

Rich G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1112,485,2525,3.0,7/27/2015,"It's Chili's, yes it's a chain, yes it is formulaic and yes it is hit or miss. This particular location  has some of the best servers around and they are pretty consistent. Even the trainees seem to be getting the needed attention to do a nice job.   I am starting with the service because you may ultimately have an issue with kitchen consistency. I am not using this one meal to determine my overall dining experience with Chili's but I think it's indicative of the aforementioned kitchen delivering the goods. Chili's has morphed their menu over the years from being a mostly burger and fries with a few salads to one with a much more diversified selection.  Take a look at this plating, both the rice and beans look like a school cafeteria or mess hall cook slapped it on there.  The  ""soft""  tacos's themselves were served in a flour tortilla that succumbed to the juices of the various fillings. Carnitas, Fish and Chicken-one of each and sadly none were a real standout.  The wrong ingredients to place in that raw flour tortilla.  Three soft taco combo I have had many other menu items at Chili's before that were far better prepared and plated that the three taco combo. What makes this dish difficult to pull off for Chilli's is the monumental number of quality Mexican and even Gringo places in the neighboring area serving far better takes on this plate. Translation I won't order this again but it won't keep me from coming back to this Chili's.  Their menu has come a long way but their execution and value for some of the dishes leaves something to be desired. Hopefully they start fine tuning what is working and what isn't and improve from there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=40

They have beer and drink specials, with $4-$5 Large beers and $3-4.50 small beers for Domestic, Premium, and Super Premium though I don't quite get the designation.  Margaritas range from $4.50-$6, and $3.75 mixed drinks and house wine. As for the food menu: $3--sweet potato fries, Texas cheese fries (half order), skillet queso, boneless buffalo wings (half order) $5--Jumbo soft pretzels, Burger bites (2) w/fries, Nachos w/ chicken or beef, Southwestern egg rolls, Boneless Buffalo Wings (full order) We shared sweet potato fries, buffalo wings (half order), and the SW egg rolls The Egg rolls came with  6 pieces and was surprisingly large. I would go back for these as they were a pretty tasty and at $5? Yeah.  The fries and wings (5) were pretty much what I expected, with the buffalo sauce having a nice zing to it.  At happy hr prices it's a very good deal.  The beer selection isn't bad, and you'll probably find something on tap you like if you like beer. Service was fine, even though the bar was busy the bartender was still attentive. Free parking in the private lot in back. Definitely worth a trip or 2. Or three.

This was not the case. It was hard and seemed like they cooked it way before we even got there.  Now the reason why this place got a 3 star is because our waiter was a douche. We've been very nice, but it seemed like he didn't want to be there at all. I have to admit it put a damper on our night. Lastly, I hate being rushed.

Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,3.0,8/17/2015,"Went here after a hike with two cousins on a Saturday evening. It was a random decision but no complaints here. Food:  Trying to keep the healthy vibe going we went with the Sante Fe salad, Quesadilla Explosion salad, and the steak quesadilla. All were pretty good, wish the salad had more salad and regret not getting the dressing on the side. The Sante Fe salad was better, it has avocados and the dressing has a kick to it. The quesadilla explosion salad was a little too cheesy but it did come with some quesadilla on the side which was a plus. The steak quesadilla was good too, plenty of steak in every bite, it also came with bacon but that might have been the only time where bacon didn't help. Overall it was pretty good meal, will remember to get the dressing on the side next time, just wish the salad servings were a little bigger.  Service: Pretty good service, server was back and forth between his tables quickly. Drinks were kept filled the entire time. Tables setup seems a little messy if they are crowded, not a lot of room in between. The pay by machine at every table is a fantastic idea. Usually always have a bad time trying to flag down a waiter for the bill.  Location: Right behind the China Olive Buffet. Shared parking but was still easy to find a space even on the weekend. Keep in mind though they have a guard that will tow your car if you park there and go to a different plaza nearby.

As S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",113,167,37,3.0,10/20/2015,Open late so that's a plus. We came here after a movie around 1030 since it was the only restaurant open. Ordered the cheese and spinach dip. It tasted amazing. Let me just say the chips here are perfect. Super thin and warm. Only down side was it took 20 mins for the appetizer to come out. I think the waiter forgot to put in the order. Anyhow for my main dish I got the ribeye steak and shrimp fajitas minus the butter that comes on top. The shrimp sucked but the steak was delicious. I got a side of lettuce wrap instead of tortillas and it was a good meal. Service was inattentive and lacking. Maybe it was because we came in late?

I've got two thirds of my plate left, and I refuse to take it home, before it eats me while I'm asleep !! They can have my leftovers cause I'm seriously not taking that shit home. Can't get over how horrible the food was. It tasted like a fancy microwave meal. Ugh!!! Worst part of the night is having to pay for something you didn't enjoy. 15 bucks and some change, plus a 3 dollar tip (which I normally wouldn't of left but woulda felt bad for him). Wtf.

When my wings finally came out they were a little on the cold side, I'd say the biggest plus was the atmosphere and the company I had with me. They have a lot of TV's in all directions which is cool too but really the service made this a 4 instead of a 5. Star review which is a shame.

Marie M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",4,24,19,1.0,2/11/2016,"My boyfriend and I frequent this Chilis quite often and we had never had such a horrible experience. First off we are told the wait time will be 10-15 min and are seated 30 min after giving our name. After we are seated we ordered drinks and those didn't arrive at our table for about another 10 min. We ordered our food at the same time we ordered drinks and once the drinks finally came we were told that the food should be coming right up. We waited another 20 min for our food and nothing. My bf ordered another beer and when that made it to our table we are already pretty annoyed so we mentioned that we were told our food would be right out and it's already been another 20 min. She just replied ""ok"" with a scared look on her face and rushed away. A while later the manager showed up, apologized for the long wait, and offered a free dessert. We agreed that was a nice gesture except we never get dessert so we weren't interested whatsoever. Our food finally came out after waiting for about 45 min total after being seated, we were starving at this point so we ate it pretty quickly. I had to ask for extra avocado like ALWAYS because they are parsimonious when it comes to avocados and the avocado you actually get on your plate never looks anything like the pictures on the menu. Anyway so my boyfriend ordered the salmon and was pretty much finished eating it when he realized it tasted different. He took a closer look and realized it wasn't fully cooked! He asked the waitress if that looked cooked to her and she agreed it wasn't cooked properly. The manager was talked to AGAIN and he simply comped $9 for the fish. Uh really? We don't like to complain but this is a must. We were calm about the long wait for everything but to have something served at your table that isn't fully cooked is a shame. He mentioned he felt sick later that night and we probably won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=100

Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,122,24,1.0,7/7/2015,"This place is horrible! I took my wife and 5-year-old daughter to eat there on Friday, July 3rd. Right as we walked in, the hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait even though there were lots of empty tables (it was not a busy time of day) and then pulled out her phone to text or browse internet. After 10 minutes I went to the bar to ask for water. The hostess finally sat us at a dirty booth (surrounded by other dirty tables) and my wife had to ask her to please wipe off food remnants from the seat. There was also trash on the floor that the hostess conveniently ignored. We sat there for 15 minutes and, even though a waiter and waitress walked passed us several times, no one took our order. They didn't even bother to acknowledge us. Meanwhile, four parties that arrived after us were immediately seated in a clean area of the restaurant. Not only were they promptly seated, but no less than three servers immediately took their orders. They had water and drinks served in less than 5 minutes. My wife and I sat astounded as this all transpired. After it became quite obvious that we were seated at a closed section of the restaurant, my wife asked to speak to the manager on duty. He said he had just arrived to start his shift. His attitude was one of, ""What do you want me to do about it, I just got here."" When my wife said we just wanted to explain what was going on, he didn't seem to care. My wife then said she would contact the corporate offices and he pretty much said, ""Go ahead, I don't care."" We said, ""That's no way to treat your customers"" and left. After I contacted the Chili's customer service department via email I realized why the manager had a nonchalant attitude. They could care less either! They said they would direct my concerns to the management at the restaurant, which made no sense at all since they were the ones I was complaining about. Talk about passing the buck!!!   To top it off the food here really is not that good to begin with, very salty. Shame on me for coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=100
Lauren P.,"Pasadena, CA",173,737,663,3.0,11/9/2012,"Out of the typical American Restaurants (Applebee's, TGI Friday's ect. ect.) Chili's is probably my favorite :) I went here for Happy Hour and it was amazing. I think since this location is right by CSUN they expect broke college students to stumble by after class, which we did. We ended up seeing a ton of familiar faces which wasn't bad, I actually enjoyed it because it made the environment that much more friendly. Our services wasn't fantastic but I get it its a Wednesday night and you have all these rowdy students coming down last minute for Happy Hour . . . it can be frustrating, but if you want tips you're going to have to work for it! We sat at the bar area and our server was very informative and willing to answer our questions the only problem we had was tracking her down when we wanted to order more.  Late Happy Hour Monday-Thursday from 9-Close Margaritas were $4.50-$5.00 depending on if you wanted classic or premium Beers ranged from $3.00-$5.00 (drafts, imports, tap) There were two sections for appetizers  $2.99 / $4.99 What we ordered . . .  Whole order of boneless wings for $4.99 and it got the job done :) Half order of sweet potato fries with parm for $2.99 which also got the job done :) I like Chili's better than the other American Restaurants because the atmosphere is different . . . more lively (especially at this location, probably because of all the students). I hope that makes sense. Overall, I am a fan and I will be back especially for their happy hour!  Note Please note that I am not praising their food. It's good, it's alright, but nothing to die for . . . like I said it gets the job done  Also note that food took forever and it was only fried food!

I checked in through the Chili's app before I got to the restaurant. It says to check in again once you are there so I did! I went up to host with bad attitude and told him I was there... he said ""okay, there are still 5 parties ahead of you"" I told him no problem. I check the app 45 minutes later and it said there was one party ahead of me. I told my sister we should be next and 6 parties later, I go up to a different female hostess and she told me the guy host never checked me in! I was soooo angry. The female hostess immediately apologized, the guy didn't even care. The girl sat us down and our waitress was in training with an experienced waiter training her. We were already irritated and just quickly ordered our food since we had looked at the menu for the last hour by the time we sat down. We ordered drinks, 20 minutes later I asked if drinks were coming soon and the waiter said the bartender made the wrong drinks, so he made him redo the drinks and the waiter never got them so they melted  (blended margaritas)!!! Finally after about 35-40 minutes we finally got our drinks. We were soooo angry we really considered just walking out, not even wait for food. When we were going to leave the food finally arrived after 2 hours of already being there we finally had food in front of us. The food was good but the overall experience just wasn't worth it. The drinks should have at least been complimentary after all the bs we had gone through already but nope, we still had a nice long check at the end of the dinner.

Kelly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,8,,2.0,6/23/2014,"Okay I would like to start this off by saying:  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Chili's The 2 for 20$ deal is one of my favorite go to lunch dates for my boyfriend and I. In the past I have only been to chili's at the West Hills Fallbrook Center or my personal favorite the one in Encino. So today after a trying day at the gym me and my boyfriend see a chili's and decided to stop there for lunch, I mean we LOVE chili's. But from the moment i walked in the service and treatment we got were just not up to par.  To start the hostess took such a long time to seats, even though it really wasn't crowded. and so we waited. Finally when we are seated we met our waiter, and i kid you not I did not see her again until we FINALLY got the check. Instead we found out that what ever we needed was always another waiters problem. It was so disorganized. Another rude and unfriendly waiter with bleached bottom highlights came and try to serve us strawberry lemonade all though we only asked for water was so rude and I swear she gave us a bit of a sneer when we corrected her, she didn't even apologize. In the end we had to wait soooo long just to get out water served and even though they were empty halfway through the appetizers we were never were offered any refills.  The actual meal in itself was still Chili's good, which is why I have to still give to stars. But they messed up my favorite part......DESSERT! I am in love with the Chocolate Chip Cookie skillet, I would take it any day over a Pazookie from BJ's! And they messed mine up and served me mine partially burned it was all dry and crunch not soft and moist. it even look quite unappealing. The third Waiter who served it didn't even ask if my meal was okay when it was obviously not.  I just settled because it wasn't even worth the trouble of finding our waiters and which one would take responsibility to help us. The worst part was how hard it was to get a check, me and my boyfriend wanted to split is 70/30ish so we asked for 20$ to be charged by a card and the rest on a separate check to be paid by cash. Our waiter the one who was MIA the whole service did have of this and made us wait an addition 10 minutes to take my cash. Then even after i asked for some of it to be in singles for tip, when i should be getting 11.88$  back I instead after waiting an addition 5 minutes get: a 10$ and a 1$ bill honestly at this point I thought to my self if you can even give me my correct change to tip you, you obviously don't deserve tip. d  I left that 1$ bill and left and learned next time I'm craving Chili's the drive to Encino is worth having to deal with the terrible service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=100

That being said, they really do not offer many options for people like me or vegetarians either. They have salmon shrimp and tilapia. If i am going to have salmon and a side i would rather have that in a more upscale place not here. Tilapia lives in and eats shit so it tastes horrible anyways, and shrimp fajitas can get pretty boring id rather have them at Acapulco down the street. They do not have any vegetarian options and if you try to substitute anything they don't let you even for an additional charge. Im left starving basically or having to settle for something i don't really want. When adding new items to their menu Chili's really needs to modernize themselves and add more options for seafood eaters and vegetarians. ESPECIALLY VEGETARIANS. There are so many people now a days who do not eat meat and honestly it is so disappointing seeing these new items on the menu like skillets and wraps and stuff but no new vegetarian or seafood options. either add more options for vegetarians or make it easier for us to substitute things and create ourselves our own happy version of one of your meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=140

Daniel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,3.0,8/13/2014,"I know it's rare to come across someone who has never been to Chili's.. but I was actually one of those people up until tonight. I knew of the place but just never really had the urge or craving to just go in and try it out. It's very similar to Applebee's to me, which I've only been to once and was not too impressed.  The best way for me to describe this place..it's not that bad.. I don't think it would be at the top of my list of places I would consider if I was trying to figure out a place to eat. Maybe if it was in the area and there was nothing else that sounded good.. after those circumstances, then maybe.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is bright and upbeat, nothing too different from any other diner such as Denny's, TGI Fridays, and Applebee's. However the hostess and servers made the place feel more welcoming as soon as we walked through the door, which I greatly appreciated. The main reasons I had to give this place only 3 stars is one, originality, and two, simply the taste of the food. I ordered a couple appetizers and for my entree the half rack of ribs. The appetizers were pretty good, but the ribs barely had any meat on the bones which was kind of a let down, especially since I believe the ribs are one of the things the franchise is mostly known for, at least that was the impression I got from all their commercials.. Nothing personal to the location I visited, you guys as a team were awesome, my review is directed more towards the franchise itself. Perhaps it just was not my cup of tea, but I can still see why people would still like eating here.. their prices are reasonable and the variety of their menu selection is solid..

Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",831,655,374,2.0,3/17/2013,"Chili's is one of those places that you go to when you have no idea where to go. It's easy.  Can't decide what type of food you like? Chili's has a variety. Drinks or no drinks? You choose.  With this particular Chili's, it used to be busy all the time but a variety of other foodie-esque restaurants have opened up in the area, I think that's why it was empty when my friends and I came here. It seemed to be getting busier though towards nighttime, which just confirms my statement of ""one of those places that you go to when you have no idea where to go"".  The food is okay, it's nothing special honestly. I haven't had all of their drinks so I can't judge those but my gin and tonic was made pretty strong, standard and boring. I don't think they play music but I'm not sure. Meh, it's just a boring restaurant to go to as a last resort if you want the restaurant experience but are on a budget, I suppose.  I sound condescending writing this. I understand that. But my love of truffle fries and good craft beer has spoiled me.  The one thing they have that I love: The Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie. It's a brownie with a layer of coconut (I think) and loaded with ice cream and chocolate drizzle with this amazing sauce and it's served in a hot skillet. When my dad used to take me to Chili's when I was a child, it's the one thing I wanted to order, I didn't care about dinner, just dessert. If I tasted it now, I'd probably still be pleased. It's one of those desserts that has EVERYTHING you want - the contrast of hot and cold, the texture of the brownie with the delicious sweet coconut and of course, CHOCOLATE.  And now I want one.

My understand is a server should check in after your first few bites....that never happened.  They have armed security. (Unsure why a security guard with a gun is standing right at the front door).

On a Friday night, three of us were seated in +/- 10 min.   The place was clean, the server was polite. The food was what you expect from a place like this. Good, though not original or unique. Flavorful but not delicious. An enjoyable atmosphere, despite the screaming kids and overly excited young love birds on a date a table away. Decent price, though with 2/3 of the menu being comprised of chicken, I don't know why they are called Chili's..... I did like the Shinerbock ribs, even if they were small.

We used to live nearby this particular one, and would frequent there but its been awhile now since we have step foot in there....until the other day.  I dont understand how a chain restaurant with the same menus and ingredients, can taste different from each other. Take In N Out for instance, they are consistently similar in taste (which is aweseome) no matter which In N Out you go to.  How do you even mess up fries???? Fries are pretty much, simple enough to make but yet these guys find a way to blow it..... This Chili's is by far a huge disappointment.

This Chili's has been here since forever and it has certainly went downhill.  The section that I was seated was quite dirty; the booths were covered with food pieces with tables uncleared.  There was even food on the floor where it was stepped on by unknowing patrons. Here's the bit about my fajitas: it was lousy.  Way too much oil was used where the veggies were swimming in it and the chicken itself was very bland.  I was only given a few pieces of chicken but nearly the entire platter was full of greasy produce.  The side of guacamole and sour cream were on the ""old"" side.  I ate as much as I could but left most of the dish untouched.  Wasn't worth the price it was tagged at. Don't know what happened to the this Chili's.  It used to be the hot spot for college students to gather.  Now it's almost a ghost town with many booths and tables emptied.   The service was just okay and the server didn't seem too happy to be there...a far cry from the way it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=160

Katelyn B.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,7,1,1.0,11/22/2015,So last night I went to chilis for my birthday. Because I really enjoy a few items on the menu and have gone to this particular chilis multiple times. I thought it'd be a good place to go. I made the reservation a week before going because it was a large party of 20-25 people and they said no problem. Our reservation was for 8:30 they did not seat us until 9:30. One of our two servers took the drink order along with a few appetizers. The appetizers came out before 2/3 of our drinks and that was about 30 minutes after we had taken the drink order. Because it was taking so long a few of my guests left. Then as they started taking our dinner order I was so upset because our waitress completely forgot to take my and my friend's order. I got up and told her we did not order yet so she came back and took it. I sat there unattended for a while with no ask for a refill on my drink and that was it for me. I went to the manager almost in tears because of how upset I was about the terrible/lack of service and he was apologetic and said he would talk to the waitresses. They came back and were much better but the manager never checked back up to make sure things were going smoothly. Overall this was probably my worst dinning experience and ruined my birthday because of how upset I was. We didn't leave the restaurant until just before 11.

About an hour and 15 mins after waiting for our food (two burgers, a salad and a cup of soup) a different server came out with our food. When we asked why it took so long, he had no response and said he would grab a manager for us, we also asked him for a refill and a side of ranch. After waiting for another 20 mins our server finally came back to check on us and we explained to him that we were waiting for items that we asked for 20 mins, he quickly went and got them for us (items that we no longer needed becuase we were done with our meals). No manager ever came to the table. The food wasnt that great, we asked for the burger to be cooked medium they came out well, we asked for onion rings we recieved fries- at this point we just wanted to eat and leave. I dont think we will ever be back to Chili's based on our experiance alone. Food isnt up to par, it took to long and staff that was waved down to get us items we requested never came back. A manager was requested and never showed up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=220

Melissa A.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",305,97,67,3.0,3/5/2013,"How can you go wrong with All Day Happy Hour Sunday? I don't think you can really. First if you register on   you constantly get coupons for a Free Dessert or Appetizer or 50% off Your bill etc. I signed up way back when I was a student at CSUN for a promotion they were having and for some reason this year my email has been flooded with promotions.  I use to go to Chili's more often when I was at CSUN because they have amazing Specialty Drinks, this was the first time in a while that I had been to this location. The set up for the most part is like any other Chili's, they have the bar sectioned off in the middle of the restaurant with two party booths, bar seating, high top and low top tables. The rest of the restaurant consist of table and booth seating. They commercial campaigns running for $20 dinner for 2 and seem to maintain that promotions, their menus have changes since the last time I was at Chili's and they now have pizzas. The Service there is nothing too special, the waiters seem to do the bare minimum.  Again, we went there for All Day Happy Hour on Sunday, it was a party of 4 and honestly, for everything that we ordered I would say they are VERY inexpensive. I for the Tropical Sunrise Margarita (ITS SO DELICIOUS) this is my go-to drink at Chili's to be honest.  I only had one and I can't really compare non happy hour pricing to happy hour pricing but I only paid $5.95 for it on Sunday. I'm a creature of habit and a VERY picky eater, my friend and fellow Yelper split a Trio Sampler and got Sliders, Southwest Eggrolls and Spinach Artichoke dip, I want to say their portions got smaller from when I remember, this could be because they have new dishware. The sliders were yummy nothing fantastic, Eggrolls were awesome (another signature dish) and the Spinach Artichoke dip was not all that hot. Personally I feel Chili's has the best tortilla chips! They are soft, flaky, warm and fresh. One of the cons to their amazingly flaky chips is that they break very easily, not ideal if you're a scooper like me!  Not to sound like total fatties but we ordered: A Que Queso Skillet, Fried Shrimp entre, a burger entre (and I'm not sure which specific one my boyfriend ordered), the Trio Sampler, Sweet Potato Fries, Full Boneless Buffalo Wings, Two tall Stella Beers, Two Skinny Margaritas, a Tropical Sunrise Margarita and the bill totaled $78 and  change after taxes and everything.

It comes with crispy onions on the burger and the huge slices of bacon, with a brown sugar rub.  Looked gorgeous, but the taste could have been better. First of all... it was not Medium Rare. I want my pink center, damn you!!! Second, the bacon had the texture and taste of beef jerky. It may sound like it would go great together in theory, but not so much in practice. The beef patty is supposed to be moist and juicy, while bacon crunchy to compliment the whole thing. Not only was the patty dull but the tough, chewy ""bacon"" made it even worse.

I ate about 4 bites of my chicken and I couldn't do it anymore I was really skeptical about how cooked it was. Since we ordered to-go I couldn't just send it back to the cooks but it felt like they treated my chicken as if it was a piece steak, attempting to cook it medium well or something. It had the grilled marks and looked lovely but inside looked like it needed an extra 10 to be thoroughly cooked and to where I wouldn't fear being terribly sick after wards. The rice and veggies were about par as well.  My boyfriend's quesadilla had chicken in it and he too wasn't very keen about the chicken. He also felt they should have made it a BBQ chicken, Bacon ranch quesadilla; he felt it would gave it more flavor.  We both agreed that if you're going to put chicken or any type of meat in a quesadilla then you should put thin slices or at lease decent size pieces, not chunks.  All I'm going to say is that I'm glad he had the gift card because I would be pretty bummed if we had to come out of pocket for that meal and that is all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=220

But really the worst thing for me was the ladies rest room. That's what put it over the top for me. The ceiling and stalls were full of spiderwebs (not the decorative kind) and I literally killed a spider in my stall.

The food here is far from perfect. Stay far, far away from any steaks here they are not worth anything. Seriously, my Samsung Galaxy SIII was bigger than their steaks and they are always overcooked, as in if you order medium rare you get more of a medium well, and the first thing you taste are the seasonings that they cake onto the meat. Anything fried there is good though, as are the deserts. Being close to CSUN, it is usually crowded on weeknights with a short wait for a table.

Tim M.,"West Hollywood, CA",32,43,3,4.0,4/4/2012,"Oh chain restaurants.  They're an interesting beast aren't they?  When a chain is as large as Chili's they've gotta be doing something right.  Right?  Here's my issue with reviewing chains, most people have at least tried them once or twice before. They already have an opinion about that specific chain in their minds before entering.  Chili's for some reason gets an Olive Garden reaction.  People are either pleased with what they get or they detest its very existence.  For me, Chili's in general has always been a restaurant that serves higher quality bar food.  Nothing special, nothing fancy.  Just simple and for the most part good. As for this Chili's, well I've been going here about once every six weeks or so for a year and a half and I really have very few complaints.  As far as Chili's food goes, it's plenty good.  I LOVE the queso dip and the mini burgers.  The cajun pasta (both shrimp and chicken) has that perfect kick (although the shrimp one is a little lacking in terms of the shrimp.  Need to cut all of them in half to have a decent amount)  The chicken ranch quesodilla is yummy and that oreo desert thing they have is nut-yourself-delicious.  Happy hour is a great deal here.  Bartenders and servers are generally pretty nice.  Granted on busier nights service tends to slack.  But hey, you get a REALLY friendly greet, then you don't see them again unless they're refilling your drinks until it's time for the check and then they're REALLY friendly again.  So it might not be the most attentive, but I'm never left wanting and the two interactions I get are REALLY friendly. Like I said, Chili's food is good for what it is.  This restaurant has never messed up an order for me and have actually come through in a pinch I found myself in (hosting a BBQ and didn't get A1!!!  I ran in asking if I could buy one bottle and they just gave it free.  I brought friends in for drinks later that week as a thank you).  They only get 4 stars because Chili's food really is just higher quality bar food.  But when you're in the mood for it, it's freakin' perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=240

You can't go wrong with a burger or my personal favorite, the Monterrey chicken (a grilled chicken breast smothered in cheese, bacon, and tomatoes served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli on the side). It's probably a better place to grab a drink. They had some decent margaritas which made going back to class a little more difficult, but a lot more fun. The staff can be friendly and I remember the bartenders to be very affable. Sure you'll run into the occasional waiter/waitress that doesn't care but what place won't you find one?

Joanna Y.,"Lawrence, KS",182,231,73,1.0,1/7/2012,"Let me just start by saying that I genuinely wish I liked this place. My life would be so much easier because many of my friends enjoy Chili's and we all live within a mile of this location. That being said... First visit: I visited this Chili's with a friend in hopes of partaking in their Happy Hour. The selection of choices was pretty limited but I settled on a margarita, taking the $4 price heavily into consideration. We had situated ourselves in the bar, figuring this would lead to pronto service. WRONG WRONG WRONG. It took the waitress 15 minutes to take our order, another twenty to bring the drink out. I might have ordered another but she NEVER came back to our table. An hour after my drink had been consumed, we had to work at getting the waitresses attention to get the bill. Being as I am in food service myself, I am usually quite patient and understanding with with waitstaff. However, the duration of the wait for her was unbearable and I wanted nothing more than to vacate this Chili's ASAP. Never before in my life have I not tipped a waiter. She was the first, and so far, the only. Second visit: this time I was here with a group of chums, CSUN students, 9 people. Our drink orders were taken promptly, and delivered just as quick. I was relieved, hoping my second experience would highly outscore the first. That is, until I saw a mutilated slice of LEMON in my Blue Moon. Everyone knows that Blue Moon is served with an orange slice. Sounds picky, but the orange adds to the flavor of the brew, and lemon definitely distracts from it. Fine. I took the lemon out and drank anyway. I had ordered their club sandwich and since it comes with ham and turkey, asked for it to be made without the ham. What should have arrived was a sandwhich with turkey, bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato. What actually came was bread with turkey and bacon. The end. I asked the waitress if I could also have the veg that was supposed to accompany the meat to which she obliged. However, when the bill came I was charged for the ""extra"" veg. *sigh....  Bottom line, I am always the first to veto this Chili's location in favor of ANYTHING else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=260

Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,2.0,8/2/2011,"So this was my first Chili's experience and I can see why this place was so happening on a Friday night. It is located right next to CSUN so a lot of the patrons were college students. I felt old now that I am a graduate. =(  Great ambiance, but barely decent food. Although I did not order this for myself, the southwest chicken sandwich that I took a bite of was pretty bomb. That's the only thing I would ever order as a meal if I come back. We came with the entire family and ordered several dishes to sample. The salmon and shrimp dish from their Custom Combinations menu was pretty awful. The only thing that was edible were the mashed potatoes. Now I wasn't expecting anything fresh from the sea but a thin slice of vacuumed packed salmon should not cost $17. Total rip off. Their fried string onions and the guacamole and salsa were pretty good. I like how they have endless or bottomless options for their chips but that actually ruined my appetite at the end. Well maybe that was a good thing considering the food was not that great. Ribs were bad. Fries were good. Chicken kickers were tasty I guess. Hmmm..let's see. Service was attentive, considering we were such a huge group. My also cousin works for Chili's so we got 25% off our meal which was pretty sweet.

Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,1.0,9/16/2008,"I started frequenting this Chili's in 2001, when I started attending CSUN.  The food is decent, drinks are good--all of that good stuff. Fast forward to now.  Within the past couple of years, both their service, and standards have gone WAY down!  The last two times that i was there ( and trust me, I will never go back), disgusting things happened. The first instance happened when I was receiving my food.  The waiter brought out my Chicken Crispers, you know those delicious but deadly chicken strips that have more batter than chicken?  Well, the waiter brings it out, and I start eating.  I noticed there was corn, which I had asked him to exclude, but no big deal.  About a minute later, he comes and tells me that it was meant for another table.  So..he takes the plate and delivers it to the other table.  Mind you, I had already eaten a Chicken Crisper!  My food came out, but I saw it leave the kitchen, so I know that it didn't come from another table (at least that  is what I told myself!).  That was just so disgusting that I pretty much lost my appetite. The second (and last) time that I went there, I ordered a chocolate shake.  It is pretty thick, so you have to eat it with a spoon until it melts a bit.  The waitress brought me the most obviously dirty spoon!  I asked her for another spoon, and she seemed puzzled by why I dared to request such a thing! Also, their To-Go service is abysmal!  They make sure to put the stupidest person they have on payroll there.  Either the food is not ready, and you will spend about 30 minutes waiting, or your food will be ready and within your fingertips, but the idiot they have staffing the counter that day will disappear so that you will never be able to pay for it.   On one occasion, it was so backed up that the manager had to come out.   Now, any good manager would offer the public something for this inconvenience.  I am not a person who thinks that they should get a free meal or something of that nature, but I thought they would at least offer a drink while we waited--SOMETHING!  He just played it off as it was nothing.  One of the other patrons told him flat out ""You are NOT sorry, so don't even say it""  I am never going back to that Chili's EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=260

Karen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,44,,1.0,4/14/2010,"Seriously? Ew. I'd rather go to Mc Donald's than here and I rarely eat fast food. (Or the Habit Burger which is right across the street! Salvation!!) If you like boring, mediocre food go ahead and come here.  And strictly stick to the American food on their menu. The taste is genuinely authentic in that the food is either tasteless or salty, or oily and fried. Mmm fried chicken strips, french fries, and a nothing-new-bland burger.. such an exciting and delicious-sounding menu!! -Not. If you choose otherwise, I am warning you: the food taste's disgustingly fake. I ordered some tacos here once. It was a disgrace. I took one bite and spit it out. I then offered it to my other friends. They took a bite and let the waiter take the rest of it away. I spent about $12 for SHIT. My friends then let me try some of their food: loaded nachos and chicken strips, First of all, the loaded nachos looked scary. After about 10 minutes the whole thing looked dried up, the cheese became rubbery and the oil from the ground beef seeped out and flooded the stale nacho chips. Another thing, Chili's skimps on the amount of food. They space out their food, (ie: ten chips for an entree, are you kidding me?, 3 disgusting tacos and a spoonful of rice?) And the chicken strips are so ordinary I no longer need to talk about them. Surprisingly, my Northridge friends still frequent this place, but now I don't ever go with them. I suppose it's an okay place to get a drink?? & well, I get that it might be a ""cool"" place to hang out and consider when you're in the VALLEY. The service is good and people are kind here, but who gives a flying fsdkl, you know? I'm not going to come here to switch numbers with my waiter. Seriously, like I said. You can get much better food elsewhere.  You can say I'm being too critical, but I know that I like good food. And sadly, you can't find that here. UPDATE!:  Okay, I actually gave Chili's a second chance recently.. and what I found is that I HATE IT EVEN MORE! My family wanted to go though I've warned them, and we all decided that Mc Donald's would be better. First of all, THE WAIT TAKES FOREVER, their Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich tastes like rubber between bricks, the burgers were overcooked, dry, and bland again.. the french fries were nothing special.. the salad was boring.. oh and their bartender sucks.. the mojito was super strong and tasted like SH!% TOO!

So, i sort of have a special attachment to this particular Chili's because when I was younger I used to come here after my soccer games every Saturday with my team and we'd bond and eat and get the chicken crispers like little 5-8 year olds love. Then my family continued to come here on occasion as I got older. Once I got past the age of like 12 I realized that Chili's was not good. But I still came with my family and there was at least some things I could eat.  1. the awesome blossom (better than Outback's bloomin onion, in my opinion. the onions are cut thinner and the sauce was pretty delish) 2. the Carribean salad. It wasn't amazing or anything but i could settle for it on occasion when i was going out with my family (who i admit, doesn't have the best taste in food) Anyway, i came here recently with my mom and they COMPLETELY changed their menu. NO MORE awesome blossom OR Carribean salad. AND the 9 new items they added are almost ALL some form of their little chicken crispers. Like chicken crisper sandwhich, chicken cisper pasta, chicken crisper with some sort of terriyaki marinade or something. Okay, so yeah, when i was 8 those things were delicious. But also fried a ridiculous amount. And now thats like half of their menu? I really think it would be hard to find something on their menu under 900 calories. Haha. Gross.  So anyway, this little incident made me really angry. I just want to be able to come here and get my little mediocre salad and remember my childhood.

Lisa L.,"Northridge, CA",0,3,,3.0,9/2/2010,"While I enjoy Chili's burgers, I just love their enchillada soup.  I think my favorite meal is their Bottomless Soup-and-Salad Combo (with unlimited chips and salsa).  The chips are so delicious dipped in the yummy, creamy soup, and the salsa is great added to the soup and topping the salad.  Cannot think of anything negative to say except that I wish this option were on their ""Two Can Eat for $20"" as I love this meal, and Troy always wanted to participate in their promotion.  Less so, now that they no longer include dessert in the promotion; guess the Molton Lava Cake was attacking their profit-margin.  Finally, wish we could get the Sweet Shots back; the Brownie Sweet Shot was just perfect for two (or three, or four) at the end of a perfect meal.  What a great way to sweeten the mouth without weighing yourself down.  So sorry they didn't see the value in that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=300
Rodolfo S V.,"San Fernando, CA",91,197,33,1.0,11/23/2008,"I hate this particular Chili's with a passion! Every time I went here, the experience was really horrible! With food giving me the runs, to rude waiting staff! The last straw was when I ordered mineral water and there was a chewed up piece of meat swimming around in it! That grossed me out but what pissed me off was when I asked the waiter to get me another one, he argued with me saying it was a lemon seed! That was no lemon seed!!! Despite that, the right thing to do is to exchange it at the customer's request! When I asked for regular water, I still found things floating in it! They must not wash their dishes well which is disgusting! Anyway, I ate my mediocre food and left the waiter a ""tip"" on a napkin (not monetary tip) that told him how much of a bad waiter he was and what he should do next time to be a better waiter. Please AVOID this place! You'd be better off going to Denny's on Tampa or the Applebee's on Winnetka...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=300
Ray P.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/13/2010,I usually order the ribs and they are some of the best I have ever eaten. I have taken bits from my wife's plate and I am never disappointed. We always share an appetizer and I think I have tried all of them and they are all exceptional. The service I can honestly say is some of the best and friendliest I have encountered. I would recommend this place to anybody that likes great food and great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=300

Mark F.,"La Crescenta, CA",1,28,,5.0,3/3/2007,"Being a CSUN student, this place is always the first place to go to for after class drinks.  Wait and bar staff is very nice.  And Chili's in general is probably the best value of the major chain restaurants (Black  Angus, Outback, Claim Jumpers, etc).  Great food, great atmosphere.  Get the Presidente Margarita, you won't be sorry.  Only downside is the place is crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=300
