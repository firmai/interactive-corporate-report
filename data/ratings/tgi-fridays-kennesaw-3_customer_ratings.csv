60,Tricia B.,"Austell, GA",27,136,34.0,2.0,2012-06-10,"Had not been to a TGI Fridays in years and years...used to love them when I lived in VABeach.  Went at 2 in the afternoon, so getting a table was not a problem. Service was attentive and everyone was polite.  Was shocked at the prices on the menu...for a chain restaurant that doesn't really specialize in anything, they had the prices of a fine-dining steak place!  Appetizers ran around $10 and meals ran close to $20...for chain food??!??!  We decided to get appetizers as we didn't want to spend $50+ at a TGIFridays.  Co-foodie got the mozzarella sticks.  They were good and you got 6 of them...but they were $9. I just bought a box of them at Kroger (TGIFriday brand; exact same cheese sticks) for $5.  Not even any garnish...just a tiny amount of either marinara or honey mustard. They were hot and cheesy and tasty, just not $9 worth (plus tax and tip!).  I ordered the 3-dip appetizer.  You got a basket of tortilla strips and 3 dips...hummus, salsa, and cheese dip.  The chips were almost inedible...some were crispy, some were so chewy that you could not bite off a piece.  The salsa had a really good flavor, but was as thin as water so you really couldn't scoop it onto a chip.  I love hummus and hummus is NOT hard to make...but they had so much garlic (and don't get me wrong, I LOVE garlic) that you couldn't eat it. You couldn't taste lemon, you couldn't taste olive oil, you couldn't even taste chickpeas...all you could taste was garlic.  The cheese dip was barely room temperature, so I sent it back. It was returned slightly warm (still not hot). I didn't feel like sending it back again and couldn't eat the hummus and sure couldn't fill up on the runny salsa, so decided to eat it even though it was barely warm.  Then found out that it, also, was inedible...it was SWEET! What on earth do you put in a jalapeno cheese dip that is sweet?!?  Bizarre.  When the server came to clear the table and asked how everything was (my plate was still very obviously full), I told him how disappointed I was in mine and he just apologized...with no offer to comp it. Unusual since I had barely touched it...it's not like I had eaten it all and THEN complained...salsa, hummus, and cheese were all almost full.  I could have complained to the manager, but just didn't want the hassle.  The server should have offered (unless they are not allowed to).  All in all, will not be back.  For those prices, everything should have been way ABOVE good...the food should have been +++++++....but it didn't even come close.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=80,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
65,Timothy L.,"Acworth, GA",0,12,,4.0,2012-07-08,"What can I say? I am a fan of Fridays - love their Jack Daniels burger.  Also I'm a big fan of the chicken and shrimp Cajun pasta and strawberry shortcake.  My biggest complaint is that they don't keep their best items on the menu.  They used to have and awesome chicken popper sandwich with this Habanero sauce on it that was amazing, a really good bacon wrapped scallops and Texas toast, excellent fish tacos, and more, but now - all gone.  Still, I prefer the variety over Chilis and the quality over Applebees, so if you are going to choose a chain restaurant, you could do a lot worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=80,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003
24,Chadwick D.,"Dallas, GA",4,11,,1.0,2012-10-23,"My mother and I have given this place more than enough chances, but after our most recent visit I can honestly say that they have no more chances; we're done with TGI Friday's. The food has been up and down there for years and my first visit there back when I was a kid should've been a sign of things to come; I asked for a burger well done and got the equivalent of a burnt piece of charcoal. We went back for the first time in many years a year or two ago and it was decent, so we thought they had gotten their act together; but alas, we were wrong again. But our most recent visit was easily one of the worst meals we've ever eaten. I had the korean steak tacos and my mom had the bruschetta chicken pasta. The pasta was overcooked, the sauce was weird, and the chicken was dried out and burnt; but the tacos took the cake. They came out with a bunch of stuff on them that wasn't on the menu listing and looked absolutely unappetizing; but they smelled even worse. The best way to describe the smell is rotten garbage and it made my stomach turn, but I decided to take at least one bite because sometimes things can smell bad but taste good; this however, was not one of those times. I spit the bite I took out faster than a bullet leaving the chamber of a gun; it was absolutely disgusting and made me instantly nauseous. And the rice that came as a side with it wasn't much better; it tasted like it was cooked in some sort of chemical solution. Sadly, I think the problem isn't just with this restaurant in particular; i think it's a problem with the company itself. Their food just doesn't cut it and I think they know it considering how they hired Guy Fieri to endorse their stuff (which lasted about a month and I'm betting it ended after he actually tried their food) and how they've used multiple food competition shows to come up with new menu items. It's sad to say, but I don't see the company lasting much longer with the quality of food their serving. In short, I can't recommend TGI Friday's to anyone, except someone I didn't overly like; but even then i would feel bad. Just avoid this craptastic chain and their sucky food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=60,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001

I have to give props to Ken, the bartender who makes my favorite drink, Strawberry Shortcake consistently, delectably delicious each time I visit.  It's one of those drinks that, if you don't follow the recipe in the book, can turn out tasting a bit off.  Ken makes it perfect each time and I firmly believe that consistency is one of the signs of a great restaurant.  TGIF's may want to put the drink back on the regular menu as, when it came out, their female customers were asking me the name of the drink.  Some of us women do have a sweet tooth and hiding it away in the bartender's book limits the drink options for women.  We're usually lucky enough to get Erica as our server, who knows our favorite menu and drink items by heart and warmly greets us each time we visit.  She is very attentive to her customer's needs and quickly delivers the goods. TGIF has a great menu where you can drop by for a quick bite and drink, offering 3 appetizers for $15, all offerings very tasty, leaving you with a desire to return and order them again.  Their full menu is equally appealing. In closing, I just want to say that Ken and Erica's joy in their job is evident in the way in which they masterfully handle a multitude of tasks in a busy environment with a smile on their face and a care for the customer.  Exemplary!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.9320000000000004,2.92

78,Renee M.,"Peoria, AZ",0,5,7.0,1.0,2017-06-29,Wow really we were traveling to TN and stopped by after getting throughAtlanta traffic and stopped in for a small bite. When I walked in their was a DJ right inside the door with a laptop and speaker playing music so unbelievably loud. The hostess couldn't hear me shout to put us at the farthest table from the music. We sat down and we're greeted by Sugar. She was a great server and took care of us immediately and quickly.  I don't think I will return to a Friday's again due to this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
74,Cierra J.,"Atlanta, GA",117,4,4.0,2.0,2017-07-01,Never really have the best experience here. Food is NEVER hot ! Especially if you order unlimited apps. They give you a hot plate with cold/ warm food. The staff is okay. I wouldn't spend my money with this place again. Sadly I keep trying to give them a chance as if it'll be better the next time and the last 5x has been horrible. I shouldn't feel like I just wasted my money,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
15,Nadeje M.,"Sandy Springs, GA",155,17,2.0,2.0,2017-07-04,"I've been to this location several times but looks like management has changed or something . Kitchen was super slow, waitress was not very attentive. The food was average at best We had another waiter in our section that checked in with us more than she did. It wasn't very busy at all ! My friend ordered wings that seemed to have miss the sauce and my burger didn't come out until 10 minutes after her wings. No apologies from our server at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

72,Wesley W.,"Marietta, GA",1,5,,1.0,2017-08-10,"One of the times I wish I could put less than a star. Terrible experience overall. Honestly, we had a coupon for a free entree with purchase of regular entree and two drinks so we thought we would have a pretty good experience. One order was a chicken sandwich which we thought was a burger due to the coloring and texture but it was a severely over cooked chicken sandwich that you could not even bite through. Service was awful on top of that. We were comped the chicken sandwich but there is not much of a way to come back from this. Will not be going back. Gives the word Friday a bad name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
9,Ground-Stander J.,"Cartersville, GA",1,105,43.0,3.0,2017-08-31,"They have ""endless apps"" for $12 and you can switch it up and get a new app after you finish each plate. My wife had endless apps and I had a burger. We both enjoyed the food. We had a very nice and pretty waitress named ""Sugar"" and she was awesome. If you have been to a TGI Fridays then you know what to expect. Next time I go back I will try the endless apps. They looked good. But I usually get filled up real fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

Our server Jordan was very attentive to us even while sitting in the bar area. Oh and I almost forgot there's always some cool vibing music in the background.

I placed an to-go order because I had a few friends coming over and when I tell you that EVERYTHING was good, I mean EVERYTHING. The ribs were so tender, the chicken was really fresh, the appetizers (potato skins, cheese sticks, potstickers, and pretzel sticks) were outstanding.

2,Terry J.,"Roswell, GA",3,62,5.0,3.0,2017-11-06,"The commercial was for a full rack of ribs for a special price. When the dish came I noticed that the length was a full rack however the width was a little smaller than other places. I got the BBQ sauce but they had a couple of other options available, including one with bacon. They weren't fall off the bone but not tough at all. Also the pit stop skins were delicious. The bacon was NOT bacon bits but freshly cut bacon. The server was busy but friendly and nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

3,Jerica B.,"Cartersville, GA",55,7,8.0,3.0,2017-11-19,"I had gotten their new Mac n cheese burger and  would have to give them kudos. Once I received the burger, I was surprised that it actually look like the burger. The only thing I didn't like about it is, is that it was over cooked. I felt like it needed some sort of special sauce on it because it tasted a bit dry. Also, we ordered a spinach dip with chips and it was delicious but they should consider giving more chips then just half a hand full. Overall the service was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
8,Kaila W.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-07,"It was awful. Our waitress was never around, our drinks were never refiled. THEN on top of that, our breadsticks tasted like Chinese egg rolls??? I was very, very confused. She also got our order wrong, and all of the waiters and waitresses were just standing around not helping anyone, yet they were singing and having a good time while our food was still not out and our drinks were still not refilled! And our waitress who was never there I say again, had the nerve to ask us if we wanted our change back, we had at least $20 in change, did she really think she was going to get a $20 tip for her poor service??? The only good thing about it was the shrimp scampi pasta and the french fries were delicious. However the service here sucks.The waiters were also sitting around and ordering food and eating, I just didn't understand that because our table still didn't have food and I had to go to another table to get ketchup because our's was empty. Way too overstaffed to have such bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

I chose Memphis and ended up taking half home.  Opted for broccoli instead of fries and it was great, not over cooked.   Our server was excellent and overall it was a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
