3,Matt K.,"Sevierville, TN",0,30,,1.0,2014-03-16,"This place was a train wreck all around. We waited for a table for 45 minutes, which would normal on a busy night. However, the people leaving were heard saying the service was so slow, it took forever. We soon found the same. Long waits between ordering, water and food. Steaks were cold or over cooked and broccoli and squash was sour. Seconds of broccoli was also rotten and cooked that way. Yuck! Why didn't anyone check this stuff after they were told?!?  Took 3 hours to have dinner. Absurd. Waitress was very pleasant but apologetic for ""kitchen meltdown"" in her words. Where was management? Bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norton-4,,,,,
1,Rodney B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,50,22.0,1.0,2014-10-04,"4 star food, 4 1/2 star waiter, 0 stars for manager and her laughable sense of not only customer service but in fact a complete lack of the most basic of logic.  Myself and 3 others went this evening and decided on the 2 for 20 special they are having in which you each have a choice of a certain entrée and either a side salad per person or an appetizer to share. We both decided on a sirloin steak and I chose to make mine the 9 oz versus the 7 oz for $2.00 more (as per the menu and the waiter). The food came quickly, was cooked to order, and was tasty. Our waiter was excellent as well. I was so excited to get a good waiter and decent food all in one visit, lol. It is increasingly rare these days as most establishments service continues to decline along with the quality of the food apparently to increase the bottom line. I find myself getting excited on the very rare occasion that I get decent service along with what would qualify as an average meal. Ahh but it was to good to be true Evidently. When the bill came I noticed the upcharge for my steak was 2.50 instead of 2.00 Not earth shattering but wrong none the less. I asked the waiter and he was perplexed. He went to go ask a manager about it and soon returned with the answer. He said the manager explained that it use to be on another special and the system was still wrong on the price. BUT SHE DID NOT CORRECT IT! I asked why she did not correct it to reflect the menu and he said that he was really embarrassed, that he even opened a menu to show her that I was completely correct. She actually sent him out to tell me I was correct but to give me the bill anyway! It took me telling him to tell her (the So called manager)  that unless she corrected the bill to reflect the menu, that I would not pay any of it. I also told him to bring me the district managers contact info. It was obvious that the waiter was very embarrassed and I must also say that he was one of the better waiters I have had (at any establishment) but alas he was doing what he was told. So here comes the manager to let me know the same story about the system.... bla bla bla. I quickly informed her that from a customers point of view that we really don't care about her system problems and that even after pointing out a mistake to her directly that it was completely ridiculous to say ""Yea your right but I did not correct it"" so pay the bill anyway. Applebee's should most certainly be embarrassed by this but should also take responsibility for hiring someone with such an obvious lack of the most basic level of common sense and customer service. Not only did this seemingly simple issue turn into a major issue and ruined the entire experience.... It ruined the rest of our evening as we could not stop thinking about this horrid experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norton-4,,,,,
2,William G.,"Miami, FL",65,1,18.0,1.0,2015-01-01,Super bad place to go .. Terrible service. Sat down and wasn't acknowledged before we finally left 20 minutes later. The place wasn't even that crowded.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norton-4,,,,,
0,Monica A.,"Manhattan, NY",4,48,18.0,5.0,2016-05-18,"A friend and I were visiting this city and ate here for lunch about a month ago. My food was very decent, but my friend said her shrimp were fried too long, but everything else was fine. Our  waitress was very attentive, even offering to switch out our chicken taco appetizer for something else in case we didn't like it. I would dine here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-norton-4,,,,,
