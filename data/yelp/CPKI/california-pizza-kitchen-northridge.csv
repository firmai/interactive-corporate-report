Troy H.,"Chatsworth, CA",810,654,195,4.0,9/23/2017,"This is another great spot to take the family and have a satisfying lunch or dinner. They have a variety options to accommidate  the hunger needs but my favorite is their spicy Chipotle chicken which has Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos and Monterey Jack with housemade roasted corn & black bean salsa, fresh cilantro and tangy lime crema. The flavor profiles in this winner will have the taste buds playing music in your mouth. Their Carne Asada pizza is also a great choice as it has Tender marinated steak, fire-roasted poblanos, cilantro pesto, yellow onions, Mozzarella, Monterey Jack and fresh cilantro. Served with housemade salsa verde. The flavor and portion size of these dishes are not only generous but also will gratify the stomach. Service is extensive and the staff makes sure that your needs are met. Parking is in their lot and is generally a non issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge
Michael T.,"Tarzana, CA",307,174,25,4.0,9/19/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen is always a nice, reliable place to go when you want a sit down meal.  The food is always very good.  The prices are a bit expensive for what it should be.  I feel like years back they raised the prices on everything.  So unfortunately this isn't a place you can go everyday... but it's a nice mid level before you get to really pricey.  Pizzas or Jambalaya are the way to go.  Their famous for their BBQ chicken pizza, but I just had their four cheese and it was REALLY good!  The guests I was with were disappointed that they didn't offer their lunch specials on the weekend, and I admit, that is LAME!  You essentially have to order dinner portions.  They really need to rethink that!  Go prepared!!!  PLENTY of parking!!!  This location is part of a mall, but outside the mall area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge

Marlene H.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,44,16,1.0,12/27/2017,"Wow worst visit ever. As I was there I took notes regarding my stay. First off we got sat down and waited 12 mins just to be greeted by the waitress, just greeted. I guess she sensed our frustration in my kids since they were hungry and started giving us a bad attitude. After we order our foos the kids pizza comes out burnt, literally burnt( I have attached a photo to show) The waitress recommended my 4 year old who was crying from burnt pizza that we cut off the burnt side. I couldn't believe it. When she did that I gave her a look and then she realized it was a bad idea to say that and made another one. In the end when we had food left over and we asked for a box. She said she would box it for us and took our food to the back out of sight. I don't know what happened to our food at that point so I accepted it but trashed it outside. She could have done someone bad to it she knew we were not happy. I still have Her a 20% tip but I won't return ever",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge

Neal C.,"Pasadena, CA",135,160,124,2.0,7/9/2017,"CPK's food is decent at best - normally this would qualify for 3 stars,  but given the high prices across the menu, there's really not enough here to warrant a recommendation.  I ordered the Banh Mi bowl, which was a pretty baffling name for a salad of chicken, quinoa, and vegetables that had virtually nothing in common with the baguette of roast pork, pickled veggies, and herbs that the dish is named after.  The veggies seemed fresh and the dressing was a solid if fairly typically Asian-style vinaigrette, but there wasn't much flavor throughout the dish - blanching, roasting or pickling some of the ingredients would've helped to give it some more variety.  I was also confused by the large chunks of raw serrano peppers served with the dish, since serranos are quite hot and biting down on these was pretty intense - again, picking them or even serving them in smaller pieces would've helped. The overall product was a relatively plain bowl that was probably a bit less tasty than what you'd get from a fast casual place for $7-8, but this cost $15 (and the portion was not particularly large given that most of the volume was taken up by spiralized veggies).   My recommendation is to go out and eat an actual banh mi. There are enough great, independent restaurants in this city with similar or lower prices that it really doesn't make a lot of sense to come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge
Joanne C.,"Northridge, CA",70,185,321,3.0,6/29/2017,"It's a very nice facility with very friendly staff and service but the food is not worth the price they charge. It's a typical chain restaurant where the food tasted mediocre but comes with a high price. We ordered the following: Thai chicken salad - very disappointing, it was drenched with peanut dressing that didn't really taste like peanuts. It was just a really sweet sauce. The full size is a pretty big portion but totally not worth $20. Took a couple bites and was over it.  Carne asada pizza - was really good. 5 out of 5 stars. It comes with a spicy salsa to dip with which has just the right amount of spiciness. The only downfall is that the pizza is on the smaller size and it was $17.  I do like how they give bread though, and it tastes pretty fresh too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge
Tina J.,"Los Angeles, CA",392,158,316,4.0,3/28/2017,"The Kung Pao Chicken and Garlic Chicken Pizza are delicious. I will probably request extra sauce on the kung pao next time because that's my favorite part. I like it saucy! The cheese on the garlic chicken pizza was different from what I remember, I wish the recipes wouldn't change.  They had a new drink there, some kind of mango strawberry cooler with lime. Very refreshing and something new. Glad this place allows their bartenders to come up with new drinks. Also ordered an Italian soda, custom order (raspberry flavor, club soda, and cream). It's kinda my thing, glad they accommodate!  We came here earlier in the day and were seated immediately. I guess it helps that it was also the weekday.

Valentina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,304,851,5.0,1/5/2017,"Last time that I had CPK food was 10 years ago and I wouldn't even think about trying their food after so long. Me and my sister were doing some Christmas shopping at Northridge mall, after the shopping we were starving; but due to her eating style (vegan), we couldn't just go eat anywhere, so we went to CPK to see if they can make a vegan sandwich for her. Luckily they said that they can make the Grilled Veggie sandwich as a Vegan Grilled Veggie sandwich and I ordered The Original BBQ Chicken sandwich and Super Spinach + Quinoa salad.  After ordering my sandwich I regretted that why did I order BBQ chicken, since I wasn't feeling to eat the sandwich with strong taste of BBQ sauce, but I just waited and didn't change my order. We waited 15 min for our food to be ready , thankfully not so long.  Oh my god! The Original BBQ Chicken sandwich was so bomb; bite after bite I just couldn't wait to chew. First of all, my concern was pointless, the BBQ sauce taste was so mild and the sandwich itself was so tangy and delicious. The flavors of this sandwich hit all the taste buds and literally I cannot say enough how utterly delicious was my sandwich. Spinach + Quinoa salad was amazing the sour taste of green apples added a tanginess flavor to the salad. My sister also loved her flavorful vegan sandwich. CPK really beat my expectation and I should consider CPK more often for high quality food and friendly service.  My overall experience was 5 out of 5!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge
Natalie Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",417,611,1435,3.0,12/29/2016,"It was after Christmas when I paid a visit to this CPK. It was extremely windy and yet there were a lot of people waiting to dine in. My friend and I waited about 30 minutes to be seated. The host was very nice, polite and accomodating. My server though, was not. He was really hard to find. Whenever I needed him for more water, condiments or even napkins, I had to wait forever to find him or get his attention. I know it can get busy and all but I feel like I didnt get the service that I deserve. The food was average. I honestly cant tell the difference because they all taste similar. Though my Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza was overly sweet. I know they are supposed to be sweet but it was so sweet that I couldnt eat more than a slice. The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine was good as I expected. That kick of lime which I guess is the 'tequila' is definitely pleasing to my palate and I reallly enjoyed the dish. We also got an appetizer, chips and guacamole. Even though portion was ridiculously tiny, guacamole was very fresh and wasnt too strong of flavor, which I personally prefer. I dont know if they make their own chips (I doubt it), but it was good. It was regular corn and blue corn tortilla chips. Even though service wasnt the best or attentive, food overall was satisfactory. But not sure if I will come again in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge

Margot C.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,128,51,1.0,7/11/2017,"My family and I came here the other night for dinner with some family friends. What a mistake.  After we sat down, we waited about 10 minutes before our server even came to the table. We put in our drink orders and then waited and waited. Finally the waitress came back with drinks and we got to order our food. We each ordered something different, including a couple of salads, a pizza, soup, pasta, and the new banh mi bowl.  The food took a long time to come. About 30 minutes at least and it was very annoying to see tables who had sat down after us get their food way before us. When the food finally showed up, they were missing a lot of items. One of the salads was ordered with dressing on the side but they just brought the salad without any dressing. We had to ask them for the dressing which took another 5-10 minutes to get. We were also missing my food and the pasta that one of our friends had ordered. That took another 10 minutes or so to eat. Which meant that the other food got cold because they wanted to wait until everyone had their food to eat.  None of the food was great, and definitely wouldn't make me want to come back here. This place is also very overpriced for mediocre chain restaurant food. There's so many better options out there that I don't know why anyone would want to come here.  After over an hour here we had to ask for the check and then flag down the manager to pay our bill because our waitress never came back to the table. All in all, not a good experience.

The crust you can easily pair it with the oil they give you as a starter. That's also what I love about CPK ! While you're starving waiting for the cook to prep your meal they got you with some oil and bread. If you ask for butter they'll give you butter as well and they don't charge you for that !

This location has happy hour 3-6pm on weekdays and it's the perfect time to visit. $4 beers, $5 wines and $6 cocktails. Josh the bartender is very attentive and friendly. There are a few big screens at the bar - Monday night football was playing when we were there. Great spot to hang out for a drink and enjoy happy hour.

Aj A.,"Chatsworth, CA",12,210,2030,4.0,1/26/2016,"Lunch date with my daughter and it was enjoyable indeed. The food was good as well as the company of my little princess.  We arrived before 4 P.M. and we decided to take advantage of their lunch special. We ordered the following: +++California Club Sandwich+++ I got the grilled chicken on ciabatta bread with bacon, avocado and lettuce. The bread was really crunchy not as soft and the chicken was cold. I though the chicken would be hot. Still the sandwich tasted good.  +++Tortilla Soup+++ This was rich and creamy with perfect balance with little sweetness to it. No too salty. I enjoyed it very much. +++Wild Mushroom Pizza+++ My daughter ordered this and I tried a slice. It was really good with all the ingredients coming together. Mushroom, blend of cheeses with Parmesan. I think it had spinach or some other greens that am not sure of. It was really good with that thin crust.  +++Mixed Salad+++ Lettuce, check peas, onions, tomatoes, feta cheese and vinaigrette dressing. Fresh and tasty. Extra dressing requested and was brought in fast.  +++SERVICE+++ It was right on point. The nice young waiter kept on checking on us. My Ice tea drink was not refilled but rather replaced with another one with fresh glass. I like that!

Dawn K.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Ate here tonight and while eating something fell from the ceiling and hit my daughter in the back. People started screaming and I see A RAT running to the next table over. The restaurant was  in complete chaos, people were screaming and jumping up on the table and chairs! Someone was yelling there were two rats running into the kitchen!I seriously thought someone had a gun! I'm so confused as to why the staff is not trying to calm the place and see them all standing off the side of the kitchen. I approached the manager and I wasn't happy after she told me that ""these things happen..."" I questioned her asking this is just everyday normal thing that happens and she said yes ma'm! I told her in all my years over never EVER witnessed this! And she also mentioned there are lots of rats in the area which ok I get it - I live in Burbank and because of fruit trees but I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED SUCH A THING. Turns out she was the assistant General Manager - she gave me the wrong number for corporate I found out this morning. My daughter had blood on the back of her shirt because the rat was all bloody (yes we seen it ourselves) and was completely freaked out so much that she had to change her shirt into something we bought earlier at the mall in the car. In my opinion the manager should have tried to calm the customers down if nothing else announced they needed to close and send us on our way or SOMETHING other then hiding behind the counter with the rest of her employees allowing the scene to unfold into chaos so much so that t thought someone had a gun inside with as much chaos as was going on!!! I'm waiting to hear back from corporate AND the health department. If they have issues they should close their doors!!

I waited longer than expected but that was fine. We were sat behind the host stand and waited to get greeted by our waitress/waiter. 10 minutes went by... 20 min... 30 minutes later my friend and I had already decided what we wanted to eat and drink and still had not been greeted. We decided to get up and leave but not without talking to the manager. The manager was literally the most rude manager I have ever met. He didn't care that he had customers walking out or that his staff had been incompetent enough to greet 2 girls (who worked in a restaurant and know what it is like during the lunch rush).

Krista S.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,11,10,2.0,8/27/2016,"I go to this California Pizza Location quite frequently and never have any issues, however my visit today was just plain awful and inexcusable. This review is solely based on the service.  Our server was Hillel and he was either a new server or just very scatter brained with no ability to multi-task whatsoever. I tried giving him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he is still learning or he was sat too many tables at once but the constant mistakes he made became too much. Examples include grabbing the dip for bread off the table (while we were holding bread in our hands ready to dip) without even asking if we had finished yet. My mom ordered a Hawaiian pizza for her and my grandma to share and he wrote down the order and proceeded to take mine. After writing my order down he looked at my grandma and asked what she would like and my mom said we are sharing a Hawaiian pizza remember. When they finally brought the pizza no extra plate was brought for my grandma so we asked someone for an extra plate and he brought the smallest plate he could find. We asked Hillel, our server for a bigger plate. We never got the plate, go figure.  Also, one of the managers working tonight, John, is just about the saddest excuse for a main manager. No customer service skills or knowledge of accommodating a customer. I wanted to substitute chips and salsa for a simple and small side salad and he said it can't be done. The poor employees at this restaurant are running around the restaurant busting their butts and apparently he is too good to help anyone. He walked around the restaurant aimlessly for about an hour and a half, never helping anyone. He checked the time several times to see when his shift would be over and also found the time to chat with fellow employees. An embarrassment to this establishment.  All in all, I'm not sure when or if I  will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=40

Secondly, my nieces were playing with the crayons and play book they give their for children and the waitress comes to drop their mac and cheese off and because one of my nieces was not fully pay attention when she said here's you mac n cheese she just tosses the bowl down hard in front of her she was so impatient with a little girl how ridiculous can you get. I ask for the manager and express to her how that was completely unacceptable behavior and she replays with ""I'm sure it was unintentional I'll speak with her"" trust me if it was unintentional I would not have complained in the first place!

I've always liked CPK, but they've really been improving/expanding everything some service, to menu, to ambiance. We ordered the avocado rolls, tequila chicken fettuccine, mushroom pizza, souffle & butter cake. Everything was delicious (as usual). They've added some things to the menu since I was last here (like the butter cake - PHENOMENAL btw!), we stuck to a lot of our usuals, but we'll definitely be back to try new menu items.  What I really have to commend this visit is the service. We loved our server - Diego, & the manager that evening - Evan (I hope I'm spelling his name correctly). We were having a great time & Diego came to the table & apologized that the food was taking longer than it should - we didn't notice at all & felt everything was timed just fine. He was insistently accommodating, checked on us without imposing very often, & just really took care of us. He also had Evan come by the table who was also very apologetic & accommodating despite us expressing much content. They then went ahead & took care of a few items on the check. When I told Diego they really didn't have to do that he insisted that they find the extra time they noticed it took unacceptable, & they especially wanted to because of how delightful we were. We're really impressed with how aware & on top of everything they were.  This was a farewell dinner we were having with my sister before my boyfriend & I move to San Diego & Diego & Evan made it very special for us. Thanks guy!

Scotty W.,"Northridge, CA",329,91,442,5.0,7/26/2015,"So was out with a good buddy of mine and we were trying to decide on just where to go eat dinner tonight. Some place low key after having a crazy celebratory weekend as well. And after driving by a couple of places that were either closed or looked too shady he suggested... hey you wanna go to CPK?!? I was like...uhh YA...you don't have to ask me twice about this place! Growing up in SoCal CPK is a staple of this area and if you don't know you better know by now that this place has upped its game as a franchise restaurant chain!  New more sophisticated look and atmosphere, new menu design,  new and more flavorful entrées along with some of the classics that we all know and love. Just a totally all around better experience for very reasonable prices that won't break the bank just because you want to eat out and have a nice sit down meal.  So from the outside of the restaurant it looked packed and I thought that we were going to have a long wait and maybe just eat at the bar. However as I went to park and my friend went in he texted me and said bar is opened but when I got in to my surprise he got us a table (sneaky bastard...lol). Inside the place was buzzing with a nice cool vibe and nicely lit. The noise level was moderate and not overbearing and this particular location was very big with outdoor seating to boot. We ordered after our waiter brought our waters and bread and gave us ample time to decide. And btw our waiter Tyler could not have been nicer,  more attentive and just all around more terrific of a service person than if you built one from scratch! He nailed our order and my buddy's lightly cooked BBQ pizza request came out perfect along with one of my favorite dishes here at CPK the jambalaya pasta. He was great...I liked that he was constantly asking how everything was and even the floor manager came out to check on our table. It was very pleasant and made us feel like they really wanted us to enjoy our food and the whole experience... which hello other restaurants is the whole reason we come to your establishment in the first place... to be made to feel special and cared for on top of getting a great meal. But I digress...lol.  To sum it all up... they knocked it out of the park tonight at this spot! 5 stars easy!

Great night thanks to this place! And let's not forget the other dinner which consisted of 15+ crazy young adults coming together for a hip hop team dinner. We probably asked for bread about 100 times and also asked for butter instead of their oil.

On August 7th around 7 pm  we went out to this CPK for dinner with my husband,my parents and my 5 months old baby for the very first time after the accident.While my family was waiting outside with the baby, I wanted to sit inside and wait, I walked in alone with a cane and body brace, first of all no one opened the door for me even though there was a girl standing at the counter, I understand  they are very busy I didn't mind it. After waiting for 20 to 30 mins finally when they gave us the seat they gave a round table with wooden chairs, with my pelvic fractures it will hurt me to sit on it so I asked the lady ( she took us to the table ) if she can give us a booth with cushion or atleast give cushion on the table for me, for that she said sorry, she cannot give one as they have reservations so cant give me those booths and also cant provide me cushion or better chair as they dont have one. She said I will have to wait again in queue to get a better seat to be available. (I did see empty booths , they gave the booth to the family who came after us) My husband talked to the manager, she said sorry to him and said they cant fit us to that available  booth since we have a stroller and its fire hazard etc, (We could have parked the stroller and just kept the car seat if needed). We had to leave without eating ,we were very disappointed the way they treated a family with a disabled person and a 5 months old infant, I believe they could have definitely done something to help this situation. Also the manager didn't come and say sorry to me . She just watched us leave.So we went to ""Yard House"" next door for the first time and loved the food and menu, service and of course the seats were very comfortable. I am glad I tried something new they have better vegan options.I dont think I will go back to this CPK. I am mad and very disappointed with them , but glad I discovered a new restaurant because of this incident.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=80

Leo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1055,641,3503,4.0,9/21/2012,"I really like eating at CPK restaurant chains especially here because it's near my home and you get good service.  Also, compared to other restaurants in the area, we always get seated quickly.  I usually go to Claim Jumper first and end up at CPK due to long seating time there.  I'm not complaining the food is delicious. Parking however, can be a little challenging cause it's located next to the mall and is always busy. Tip - have one of your family members or friends get a table while you look for a parking to save on wait time. All of their salads, pasta, and pizzas are delicious. I don't remember a time where I didn't like anything that I've ordered.  My favorite is the cajun jambalaya pasta, gorgonzola pear pizza and chicken Moroccan salad. All highly recommended.  They also have a great dessert menu. I've had their red velvet cake, tiramisu and butter cake with ice creams which are all excellent. I will definitely be back again!

Karla A.,"Manhattan, NY",366,17,2,5.0,11/3/2015,"I called in to see how busy they were because a friend and I wanted to use the free wifi to use our laptops and do some planning for an upcoming trip. We weren't sure if CPK was a good environment for that type of thing, but honestly starbucks was too cold and too loud and it's rare that restaurants in Northridge have free wifi, surprisingly. Melanie, the manager, answered the phone and was SUPER understanding and set us up with a spacious table for both the food and our stuff! We ordered a pretty hefty meal and didn't feel awkward staying a little longer than usual to finish our planning. Everyone including the hostess and our server were very nice and understanding of the work space we had set up! Melanie even came over to sit with us and thank us for asking about availability to stay longer than usual as using laptops during busy hours can sometimes be a bother for customers and servers. I'm super grateful for everyone's kindness and that we were able to hang out. Thanks guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=80
Shelby H.,"Los Angeles, CA",520,18,4,5.0,6/23/2015,"Let me just start by saying... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! My boyfriend & I always buy the BBQ Chicken Pizza from the frozen food section & it's actually really tasty, so the fresh baked version has to be better, right?!  When we walked in, I was really impressed with the restaurant itself. They have a very open layout, so you don't feel cluttered or crammed at all. Our server's name was Ken, & his service was impeccable! I have no idea how anyone can give him a bad review. I feel that people just find things to complain about.  Seriously, ask for him when you come in! He literally walked us through the entire menu & was  very honest about recommendations from the food to drinks! I ordered the California Crush drink, which was very tasty (& strong) & my better half ordered a beer! They do start out off with yummy bread with oil & herbs for dipping. It's hard to go wrong with that. When it came time to order our food, Ken recommended the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine for myself & the boyfriend ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza with Bacon. Can I just say I love Italian food. It's my absolute favorite ever, but rarely does a dish really top my list. I HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. It is literally one of the best dishes I've ever had. I got it with extra sauce, like Ken suggested, & it was just absolutely delicious. The pizza was ridiculously amazing, as well.  We were going to finish off with Strawberry Shortcake, but Ken wouldn't let us lol. He insisted on trying the Buttercake. All I'm going to say is... holy moly. My mouth is salivating again! After our dinner, we were able to chat with Ken for a moment. We told him we were fairly new to the area & he literally wrote down the best restaurants to go to in the area! I was so appreciative of that, because it can definitely be overwhelming having 15 restaurants every couple blocks! All in all, it was a fabulous dinner. Go... ask for Ken... order the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine with a California Crush to drink... don't forget about the Buttercake... & you will have a fabulous experience! We will be back! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=80
Cynthia O.,"San Fernando, CA",34,102,72,4.0,9/21/2014,Hadn't been here since they changed their menu. Very happy with my meal last night. The iced tea was freshly brewed and tasted great. They serve you bread with a choice of butter or olive oil. The bread is very well baked with the right amount of crunch and softness. The roasted vegetable salad is AMAZING! The veggies are so warm and the dressing is a good compliment. The barbecue pineapple pizza is so good!!!!! The red velvet cake is just heaven on earth. So moist and the Hagan daas ice cream makes it perfect !!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=80
Lauren P.,"Pasadena, CA",173,737,663,3.0,4/25/2014,"I called in for a pick up order and the service was spectacular. The lovely lady on the other end of the phone was so sweet and patient. I mean she did try adding on a bit but it wasn't obnoxious or anything.  I like that they offer curbside pick up. Personally, I wish I would've used this service because they had blocked off the majority of the lot in front of CPK to accommodate the Farmers Market. I completely understand why they did this but the Farmers Market wasn't happening until later and there weren't many people setting up yet. In short it was a hassle and waste of time having to deal with the people and the parking situation especially on a short lunch break, Food/Price I ordered their 10"" margarita pizza and added on some red onions for $13. The pizza was light and refreshing with a simple tomato sauce. I thought it was good but probably not worth the $13 price tag. I guess if I was sitting inside and enjoying with good company I could see $13 being reasonable. However, I am rating them on the food itself and lets just say it doesn't say too much. I also ordered a half Caesar salad for $7. The salad was good but nothing special nor unique and really not worth the $7 price tag. Why is a basic HALF salad $7 when I can get a much bigger and better anti pasta, with meat, for about that price at most Italian restaurant  Overall I guess it's an option but you can do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=80

We tried one pizza with honey wheat dough, which was tasty, and another that had spinach and mushrooms, which was splendid.  The service was very good. Wait time, was no more than 5 minutes. The price was not bad either. I will definitely go back. Which reminds me I saw a good deal at Costco. $79 for a $100 gift card.

I recommend this for everyone who likes the spinach artichoke dip.  We got the dip as well and I can't believe I'm saying it but the pizza was better than the dip.  Service was great, everything came out quickly and was delicious.

Rich G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1112,485,2525,4.0,2/23/2014,"I had not been to a CPK in sometime and I am starting to wonder why not? This mall location is busy, but well organized and very well staffed. We were seated promptly and our waters were there quickly and service with a smile seemed to be the norm here.   CPK has so many choices but I really think their signature pizza's and salads are their star attractions.  The night we were there they were running a limited selection menu special. One appetizer, two entrees and, one dessert to share for $30.  The choices were reasonable and it sounded like a great deal.   We shared the following and it actually ended up being too much food, the pizza came home nearly in tact.    Appetizer:  Artichoke  dip served with tortilla chips.  This is one heavy appetizer, very filling and quite salty, still good though.  Entrees: BBQ chop salad. I still enjoy this salad and they did not skimp, this was an entree unto itself.  All the goodies are in there, just a touch heavy handed on the dressing.  Margherita Pizza Wow this was a homerun, good enough for Spago's if you drizzled a touch of olive oil on top. Lite, fresh, crispy and chewy at the same time. A real treat and what CPK built their oven fired pizza reputation back day.    Dessert: The Butter Cake  is part cheesecake, part pound cake topped with vanilla ice cream, you do the math, sinful decadent and pure genius.   Very satisfying and pleasant experience and a value to boot. Good job CPK a return visit is eminent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=100

Yes they are not perfect either and sometimes they take a while or get a drink wrong, but at the end of the day the staff is very polite and the food is of very good quality.

KAyla R.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,6,5,1.0,5/26/2015,"This place was awful. We came here for my sister's 18th birthday. There were 10 people in our party.  Our waiter Ken, acted bored and exasperated with us from when we came in. We ordered drinks, and I didn't get mine until 15 minutes after everyone  at my table had gotten theirs. We ordered the spinach dip appetizers and found a very long hair in our dip. So the manager agreed to take it off our bill.  THEN, 45 minutes later we finally got our food.  Our pizzas were cold as were put pastas. The manager came an apologized and brought out new pizzas.  Finally we get desserts and in my mom's strawberry shortcake's whip cream there was a green bean. When we told our waiter, Ken, he responded by saying that it was actually an asparagus not a green bean. And it's because the salad guy also makes desserts. Since we were unimpressed by this fun tidbit, we requested the check and left. This is really upsetting. We had multiple issues and our waiter was absolutely terrible. His apathetic attitude and service left vast amounts of room for improvement.  The manager was sympathetic but generally useless. He took the ruined items off our bill but did nothing to improve the standard of service.  We had 10 people in our party, most ranging ages 18-30 and no one was carded for alcoholic drinks.

Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",507,559,1042,4.0,4/7/2012,"2nd time coming to CPK!~ The first time I was actually really excited because before I moved to California, I used to buy frozen pizzas that were called CPK only because it was BBQ Chicken!!  Even if it was frozen pizza... it tasted good~ So when I found out about this place, I was like ""OMGSH! It's the real place"" of course that sounds silly.. My first time experience wasn't that great because I think I got sick ... after eating the Chicken Piccata... since it was super oily... Well this review is about my 2nd time experience so here goes! My sister (who is visiting from Washington) and I went inside and were asked our names but the hostess didn't tell us how long it would be... We waited about 5 minutes... (the thing I don't understand is when they have open tables in front of us and no one gets seated there) No need to rush, so I just took in the interior of the place and so far I do like the inside but... only problem is... the low ceiling makes people talking really NOISY... Our server was nice and asked us what we would like to drink and if we wanted any appetizers. Usually when I go to a restaurant the lemonade flavors are strawberry or raspberry but CPK had peach and mango lemonade which threw me off! I asked our server which one tasted better and she suggested the peach lemonade so I gave it a try. Not really better than the raspberry lemonade but I did end up getting a refill :) The actual reason we came here was because last time I came, someone in the group ordered Crispy Mac N' Cheese and I only had a bite of it last time. We ordered it of course and it tasted good :)  Next, I ordered the Pesto Cream Penne with Shrimp minus the Sun-Dried Tomatoes. (I don't like tomatoes) My sister ordered the Four-Cheese Ravioli  (which I actually wanted first... because Ravioli is my favorite!!) Both came out on a decent time and we digged in. I tried the Four-Cheese Ravioli first and my sister tried the Pesto Cream Penne first! We both fell in love with each other's dishes so we switched. I ended up gobblin' up all the ravioli and my sister ate a decent amount of the penne... (except she had penne pasta 3 times this past week...) Our server came around a couple times asking if everything tasted alright and she left with a funny look on her face, probably because we switched our dishes haha. I definately want to come back and eat the Four-Cheese Ravioli again because I even loved the cheesy color of it on top plus the texture of Ricotta is... the best~ I would give it 5 stars... but the noise level.. kind of ruins everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=100

Naomi N.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,66,96,3.0,2/10/2016,"I had a decent time at dinner tonight. The hosts didn't seem to be communicating well. One host pointed to an ideal little booth that my boyfriend and I both excitedly accepted. However, then the other host (who was standing next to the first host) walked us to a different side of the restaurant to a booth next to the bathroom. Of course we asked for the booth we were originally offered and she then had to check if it was available and then walked us all the way back over. We sat and our server was Erik. He was nice and answered every question we had about the menu. Service seemed a bit backed up but we understood that was due to his section being completely packed. We started off with a mango iced tea, strawberry mango cooler, and the avocado egg rolls. The rolls I have to say tasted fine but were actually just one small piece of avocado in the front and none in the rest of it. For our entrees we ordered the chicken piccata and the jambalaya fettucine . The chicken piccata was great. The chicken was moist, and we loved the capers. The jambalaya however left a lot to be desired. We actually ended up sending it back after a single bite each and apologized profusely. The taste just wasn't right and the pasta was way too thick and the textures just didn't go well together in our opinion. We did however get the butter cake for dessert which ended up being absolutely delicious. Erik said it was, ""Hands down the best dessert they have.""

She came back a little later with a Dr. Pepper and waters and told me the bartender was backed up, I noticed what appeared to be two bartenders and a not so full bar. Finally the manager walks over with my drink and asks for my ID once again, which I have never experienced before. She too took a little longer than normal to give it back. She then asked for a second form of ID. I then mentioned that I just turned 30 and handed her my expired college ID with a photo from 2009 and my California driver's license has an updated photo from July of last year. Her reasoning to question my ID is because my hair is lighter. Most people would probably feel honored that this happened but I am not one of those people.

I think they might have done something to the food because all three of us got sick for several days! 3 days for my sis and I and 5 for my son! He couldn't go to school even! Im not sure what it was and if the cook was upset because we sent the food back.. We always order the pizza with extra extra sauce. Last time they brought it super DRY even after we said so and the server and manager agreed there was almost NO SAUCE. So they told us next time we come say EXTRA like 5 times. So we did. So this server said Okay I will MAKE SURE the cook knows, because we told her the last incident. When our food came out, it was the same as before and came out DRY with almost no sauce AGAIN! The server too was confused and promised us she said it to him about 4-5 times so she didn't understand why he wouldn't put more on. They tried to give us extra sauce in a dish to dip it in, but it doesn't taste the same, plus it wasn't even hot. After trying to just dip it, we thought it was ridiculous to pay for something that we didn't ask for and that wasn't even good! We go there every week and for 3 ppl we always get about 5 dishes! So we sent it back and besides the food coming out AFTER my sister and I were DONE with our food, and my son shared my pasta because he was starving, that by the time the pizza came out, he was full. But he wanted it so he ate a piece and we all tried it to see if it was right this time. Well, maybe we shouldn't of, because we don't know what they could of done to it, but all I know is we got terribly sick with the worst stomach pains and cramps and other disgusting details that I won't share on here. We couldn't even sleep through the night and we had to stay home 3 days straight! As much as we used to love their food... we have NO DESIRE to go back soon!!!! We won't say ever, because again, WE LUVED their food. Maybe just not to this one? I don't know. But definitely not trying to send the food back and re order if its wrong, maybe just cancel the order, because I would not want to go through that again even if someone paid us!!!!!!!  Hope this helps. Sorry its so long, but just wanted everyone to know the situation and remember that if u send something back... BE CAREFUL they might do something to your food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=120
D C.,"San Jose, CA",282,32,3,1.0,6/29/2016,"I was on my way home last Thursday 6/23 when I noticed that my credit card was missing.  I figured I must've left it there so I called the restaurant. Tanner picked up and transferred me to the manager.  The manager said he had it.  They were closing in 8 minutes (9:30pm) so I asked if I could just knock on the door in case I get there 5 minutes late.  He said he would not be able to let me in after closing.  I don't live in the area and didn't want to have to drive all the way back from home on another day, so I rushed back to the restaurant and ran up to the door at 9:31pm.  The doors were locked.  The restaurant was still full of customers.  I knocked on the door and showed the hostess my wallet, signaling that I left my credit card.  She signaled the manager, who walked to the patio door (next to the locked main entrance where I was standing). He stuck his head and half of his body out of the patio door.  I said i called earlier and just needed to pick up my credit card.  He said I would need to come back tomorrow since he already locked the doors 2 minutes ago and it was a security issue.  I asked if he could just bring the card out to me and he said no.  As inconvenient as it was, I knew he would not accommodate me and I did not want to cause a scene - so I said ok and left.  He had a very unfriendly demeanor, even on the phone.  I suspect that he locked the doors early just to turn me away.  I get that it was my fault for leaving my card there but it would've been much better customer service for him to bring the card out to me or let me in since I called ahead.  It really ruined my experience, and I drove home upset.  I did not understand how it was a security issue to let me in 1-2 minutes after business hours when the restaurant was still full.  Even if he didn't want to let me in, he could've brought the card to me.  He had already stuck half his body out of the patio door so it's not like the place was locked down. I returned on Friday 6/24 to pick up my card.  A different manager was there.  I asked him who the manager from the previous night was.  He said it could be Angel or John.  I really hope that if this is an actual rule, you review exceptions to the rule for customer service purposes.  I submitted a complaint to   that night and also left a comment on the California Pizza Kitchen Facebook page.  It's been 5 days, and I have not received a response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=120
Mario J.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/24/2016,"The worst experience in this Northridge CPK. Not the first time this has happen. The first time we ever been in this place we all got our food out in different times apart, and told our server to check on what was going  on and the manager came back and said our food was never enter to the system. We received a $10 discount that day and with an attitude by the manager. Like if it was our fault. Today 6/24/16 waited 15min to get seated and after been seated no one ever offer even drinks for 20 minutes when I just decided to walk out with my family. Management needs to be changed in this CPK with real experience that could train their staff. A table in front of us was also complaining to the manager and we still went unnoticed. The way the table was being treated was very unprofessional. I tried to give it a second chance and they blew it again. We decided to walk out the place and never come back to the Northridge CPK. This review will show you how much they care. No one will ever do nothing and will go unnoticed.

Angeline A.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",613,23,30,2.0,10/9/2015,"Had a really bad experience here. Food is was great and that's why it gets 2 stars. My boyfriend and I ordered the fried mac and cheese balls with extra cheese on the side. They were smaller than the ones I get at the Sherman Oaks/Encino Locations...But they were great. We ordered Barbecue Chicken Pizza as our meal & it didn't disappoint.  We went on the night when Farmers Market was open.  Service was terrible. The host was great and Tyler was wonderful but our actual server, Alex, was terrible. When we sat down she said that she was ""Sorry"", and that she'll be ""right with us"". A couple minutes passed, and Tyler greets us, and takes our drink and appetizer order. He had a great personality and we were happy with him, until he tells us that he's only helping Alex out and she'll ""be right with us"" -_-... She seemed rushed, bothered, and dis-organized. Barely came to our table. When I got the appetizer, I wanted the extra cheese on the side for it. She didn't come by so it was just sitting there until probably 10 minutes later or more when Tyler, reminded the runner who served us the bread that I wanted butter and extra cheese. He apologized, and we loved him but then that was the last of him. Alex took over and she was just so un-attentive. Our friends joined us a few minutes after us being there and she seemed annoyed. Mind you this place wasn't full, or busy. My friend ordered the mango lemonade & water, she just brought the mango lemonade, no water. My boyfriend never got his refill for his pepsi and every-time she said she was going to get it. She forgot. She would pass our table and say she'll be right with us, or she'll bring us refills and literally just not come by with anything. I never got a refill on my water, and neither did my friends. It seemed like she didn't like her job.  The only time she was enthusiastic was when I was asking her about desserts and she recommended the Butter Cake, with haggen daz Vanilla Ice-cream (Which btw was AMAZING) but I'd suggest paying the extra $1.64 for the extra scoop of ice cream it just goes so well with the cake.  Overall, the food was great, as expected. But the Service was all over the place.

Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3417,3.0,12/19/2013,"After a busy week and light lunch, I decided to treat my mother and myself to dinner. We had to take a break from our usual eatery. So, I chose something close to home. It has been a long while since I had pizza and I wanted to pick a classy place such as California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) at Northridge Fashion Center. Located at the north side of Northridge Fashion Center and near Macy's. CPK is elegantly designed. We decided to get a booth near the kitchen. My hostess was a cutie named, Megan. I used ""My"" versus ""Our"" because I had a liking of her from the start. We started off with our complimentary bread with olive oil & herbs. After devouring our complimentary bread, we ordered a quick appetizer of White Corn Guacamole & Chips ($3.99). Its a simple plate with tortilla chips with a scoop of guacamole. I wish there was more chips and more guacamole. After a quick bite, I ordered the main dish of the night. I was worked up through the day and decided none other than ""The Works"" Pizza ($13.99). ""The Works"" consists of mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage, onions, and heck a lot of green peppers. Its hand tossed and the bread was very thin. I ate more of the ingredients than the dough. Now, that's what a pizza should taste like. The meal wasn't greasy and Megan took care of our table. I made a mistake of asking for napkins, but as I mentioned it was not greasy nor it was messy. I ate four slices versus my mothers two slices. However, this meal is rewarding since I have been good in the past couple of years and its time to work harder for 2014. Yelp!

Don't let the delicious words fool your taste buds! Speaking collectively for all of us vets; one does not simply give a vet who has served this country and has given a lot: lukewarm food, and two black hairs on the plate. I did not feel like complaining and making a bigger deal than what it was, but I am dissapointed with the quality of food, and customer service that was given to me.The sauce was tasteless as was the chicken. It's pathetic how Veterans' get better quality food from a hungry man dinner than a popular resturant. I'll put it this way, my wife paid for her food and she got way better quality food.

Holly V.,"Arcadia, CA",862,129,53,3.0,8/6/2015,"hmmm I love cpk but I have a couple of complaints.  First they are super overpriced... but I deal with it sometimes if I'm craving.  I discovered the kung pao spaghetti a couple of months ago and I always get that now when I go. I know what you're thinking... ""eww that sounds gross"" but TRUST ME it is soooo good. I usually order it with the chicken which is always extra (of course) even though I don't love their chicken and feel like the portions of chicken they give is NOT worth like $3. But I feel like a fatty if I eat a full meal of pasta with no meat.  OK so on to my complaints about this location.  I came here and ordered to go once. The guy told me it would take about 10-15 minutes. So I just waited instead of going into the mall to make a quick return. I ended up waiting almost 30 minutes !!!! That is ridiculous! AND the portion they gave me was SO little that I was not even full after I finished my pasta AND the bread... smh. I am so disapointed in you.  This was not my first time ordering the kung pao spaghetti so I know how the portions are suppose to be.  I usually am stuffed when I finish my meal or sometimes can't even finish my meal.

I've forgotten how good their bread is! Little slices, like baguette size, of sourdough. Fresh and warm with olive oil to dip in. The olive oil is perfectly seasoned with sea salt and herbs....DELICIOUS! I sat at the bar, my server, Shane was AWESOME! I haven't had such a friendly and attentive waiter or waitress like him is quite some time! Everyone working there seemed to be happy and upbeat. I ordered the small portion roasted veggie salad with Balsamic vinaigrette. It was huge! I had enough to take home for dinner. It had roasted peppers, corn, artichoke hearts, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms and romaine, I added blue cheese crumbles to it which really gave it a kick. I also had the peach ice tea which was very good! The reason for four stars is it was FREEZING IN THERE....It actually felt good to walk out in the 90+ degree hotness to thaw out.

Krista F.,"Los Angeles, CA",100,27,,1.0,12/25/2012,I had been craving a California Cobb salad for the longest time and couldn't find any friends to go with me because they all can't stand cpk...so when my mom wanted to go I was ready for a yummy salad... Apparently cpk has gone WAY down since the last time I came and I can understand now why none of my friends want to go. The bread and butter were cold (how are you supposed to spread cold butter on cold bread?). Then the strawberry lemonade was WAY too sweet (and I LOVE sweets). Last of all the lettuce in my salad had obviously been frozen and was clear all over (also made it painfully cold to eat although I definitely like a crisp cool salad).   So thank you cpk for fixing my craving for your formally really tasty California Cobb salad!

Favorite salad is the cobb, and the half portion is perfect for lunch. All very fresh ingredients. BBQ pizza is what they are known for, and it is fairly decent. Service is spotty at best.

Sara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,37,22,4.0,7/7/2012,"This is mine and my sister's go to place when we just wanna have lunch. I'd say its really a toss up for good or bad service. I will say though, that the only time that we have been seated outside the service was definitely terrible. I understand that having guests outside might be a little tough, but seriously, we sat through the entire meal without having our waters refilled once, and the only time we saw our waitress was when she took our order, brought our food, and gave us our check. My advice for all you guys would be to sit inside, even if the wait is longer, it usually isn't as long as they say. It's totally worth it to sit inside! As for the food, I've tried just about everything on their menu. Like I said, its my go to place! My favorite is the chipotle pizza! it has chicken and this pico de gallo mixture on top of it, and it comes drizzled with cilantro and lime sauce that is soooo delicious! I ALWAYS ask for a side of that sauce! Other mentionable pizzas would have to be the habanero carnitas, tostada, and spinach artichoke pizza. They have a small cravings menu with is alright, but it is what it says, small. The chicken quesadilla, is pretty good, but for $5.00, you could just make it at home lol. The macaroni bites, and korean tacos are also pretty good!  As for drinks, the lemonades are usually on the sweet side, but good to have every now and then. The coladas are pretty good at this location, too! The only drink I'd advise against would be the cherry limeade, I was thoroughly disaapointed. I felt so bad because I kept asking the waiter to fix it, until I finally gave up after probably the 4 glass?  Anyways, if you've never been to CPK, you should definitely go! and try the chipotle pizza! (: just don't sit outside lol and if you are starving when you get there, just ask for bread while you wait.

Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,4.0,8/2/2011,"So we came here on a Wednesday afternoon for a quick lunch before I headed to the mall to find the perfect bridal lingerie for my cousin's wedding. I ordered my all time favorite Miso Salad...which they used to offer a combination of crab and shrimp and now it's only shrimp, their 3 cheese and basil pizza, and the white corn guacamole as an appetizer. Let's just say that the 'guacamole' was more like a half a cup of corn with a hint of avocado. Quite the disappointment but what can you expect from a $4 appetizer? I would think a decent portion of guacamole but I was wrong. =| DARN! The salad was great, everything I had expected the Miso Salad to taste like and for $15, it better be. They were very generous about the shrimp which was a plus since I love shrimp. I was surprisingly impressed with the pizza. I will definitely order that again since it wasn't too heavy but tasted amazing nonetheless. It was a great meal/experience....until I noticed a lady bug in my salad. Now here is the thing, though any insect in my food is absolutely disgusting, I was not grossed out about the lady bug. Maybe because it is red and cute and not nasty looking like an ant or a cockroach..*shivers*. We discretely pointed it out to our waitress, who was exceptionally nice throughout the entire meal, and she took it to the back. I didn't think it was necessary to make a big deal about it and cause a scene since it is not their fault a lady bug flew in my salad. Now if it was any other bug...I would have ran to the bathroom. I believe that lady bugs are a sign of good luck so I was kinda excited/enticed by it? I don't know.  Anyway, the managers came in and apologized for the extra ingredient in my salad. They explained to us that the vegetables are not sprayed with pesticides so sometimes bugs do get on it. I guess they didn't catch it when they were making my salad. Oh well. I had assumed they would comp my salad but they actually comped our entire meal. It was very nice of them to do that since I wasn't really disgusted by what happened. It was definitely an interesting experience. So we had a free meal, but left a very generous tip for our waitress. She was great. The kicker was as we were going out, I overheard the manager tell the chefs, ""Let's not garnish our salads with lady bugs."" Ahahaha, that definitely made my day. Now on to my day of good luck...I found the perfect lingerie for my extremely blessed cousin at Frederick's of Hollywood for half off. They were the only store that catered to women with gigantic bosoms. I also scored an amazing dress for $20(for the same cousin) from June's, right across from Frederick's. And on my way back to the car, I stopped by at Borders and found a book that I have been looking for, for years, for just $4.

I have never had a problem with this restaurant and would recommend the sicilian pizza here.   The only thing I don't like is the bread they serve you as you wait.

We sat at a booth as requested right away. Server was nice. we tried a couple of their new mini appetizers and I gotta say the itty bitty artichoke heart bites were very tasty. then we shared the italian tomato and basil pizza on their thin crust. no one should order pizza on their regular crust here. thin crust is just to die for. pizza was good as always.  overall good experience.

No, not like theres a piece of wool or something on my plate, theyre GREASY with food left on them. unacceptable and disgusting. I either send back the plates every single time, or I just don't use them.  Fuck, maybe the tables cleaner, who knows. They've gotten a B rating three times, each time about a week or so later, it gets changed to an A (I work at the mall, so I'm aware). Make your own inductions about that one. I've noticed their quality of food has gone down significantly in the past two years, while the price has gotten higher. Great. Salads don't taste that fresh anymore. I'd much rather prefer BJs or Fridays or Cheesecake. I think the only thing that good is the DOUGH for the pizza (don't get excited, just the dough.). I've given you enough chances CPK, you little ""oh heres some stale bread to go with your meal"".

Brittainie B.,"San Francisco, CA",76,121,2,4.0,7/13/2012,"I like California Pizza kitchen. They have alot more drink options than alot of places- smoothies, coladas, lemonades, limeades, slushies, teas, coffees, wines. I've always been a big fan of drinks and i appreciate all their options as i feel like more places should have them. The first place i look on the menu is the beverage section, and if soda, water, and afew beesr or wines are the only options it sort of makes me a sad panda lol ^.^ their pizza is different but in a good california-home-BBQ way. This is my aunts favorite place to go in the area because they have really good and unique salads. The portions are always good. My aunt got a full BBQ chicken salad with avocados and garbanzo beans without tortilla chips *strange that you have to add garbanzos if you want them like avocado*, it's her favorite. i got a half carmelize peach salad with salmon and avocado. My grandmother got fetticini alfredo. Their alfredo is much lighter and less saucey but in a really good way. I only eat half of the half salad as the portions are pretty big. Salad was great. Peaches could be more carmelized as they were really just soggy but they still tasted great. My salad consisted of gorgonzola, cranberries, walnuts, arugala, spinach, and the avocado and crunchy-skinned salmon that i added. Great compliments to the salad and they had a nice portion of every ingrediant with a fresh lemon non-oily vinegrette which i appreciated. The food here is consistently good which is nice because alot of places are on and off in quality. Bread is ordinary and stale. Coffee and mango raspberry colada was great. Tiramisu for dessert was also lighter and really yummy ^.^ grandmother and aunt also had an apple crisp with icecream. My aunt always orders that i didn't try it but they liked it. I highly reccomend the place the staff was kind except the guy who seated us who seemed alittl too self loving and bro like. But everything was pretty good as it always is. I'm only in LA on my ocassionaly breaks so this place isn't on the top of my list. Wish we went someplace more LA-exotic as CPK is a chain all over and i'm not a big chain fan especially when it comes to resteraunts, but it's a good chain and i appreciate their accomodating menus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=280

Prior to our meal, our table ordered the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadillas, which were thicker than expected, and the Tortilla Spring Rolls, which were cooked perfectly and very flavorful.  I selected the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken and have decided it is my new favorite salad.  The dish was full of roasted butternut squash, avocado, toasted almonds, beets, and a good amount of chicken that was not overly spiced.  The Champagne vinaigrette wasn't too sweet or overpowering considering the salad also contained cranberries and dates.  Our table also ordered the wild mushroom pizza that had just the right amount of wild mushroom walnut pesto in addition to the California Club Pizza that fortunately was not soggy.  Though all of our ordered items were tasty the highlight of the meal was the Salted Caramel Pudding.  The dessert was portioned perfectly and balanced the sweet caramel pudding, chocolate crumble crust, and sea salt so well that we ordered a second one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=280
Rina K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2008,"Okay, before you guys think WHAT?!!! adfsud about my 1-star, let me explain. CPK has good food BUT... this branch is absolutely SHADY!! When I received my check, I noticed that the tax amount was way off scale from what it should have been. like WaY OFF. The tax in Northridge, CA is 8.25% but when I calculated the amount with my cellphone's calculator ( I have no shame in using it at a restaurant!!), the tax they used was 9.75% tax. WHAT THE HECK?!! that's illegal!!! So I talked to the manager and told him about my situation and all he said was ""look, I have no time to go over this matter. The computer is right and I can't explain it right now. What do you want me to do; it's not worth it to lose you as a customer over a few dollar bills. I mean this has happened before, but I can't explain, the computer is right.""  There are several problems with what he said: 1. the customer is always right until the manager proves otherwise 2. the computer doesn't automatically know what the tax % is of the location. it has to be manually inputted so obviously this is human error 3. don't belittle a customer and say it is only a few dollars 4. THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE???? obviously, the computer is wrong then! I was shocked and in disbelief. Imagine how much this branch is jipping people.

That is all fine and dandy but it was quite uncomfortable and I have not experienced that at a restaurant before. We were not even really lingering for a long time. So we pay, sign the checks and put down the tip and before we can gather our bags and get up she is already grabbing her tips and the credit card slips in front of us as fast as she can go. It is isnt like it is the most offensive thing in the world, but it was unnecessary. I am sure she could have left and gotten her tips another time.

As far as food went (our orders): split pea and barley soup---4.5 stars, with some lemon squeezed very good appetizzy. Green onions totaly unnecessary. They need more soup variety; its either this or that tortilla chicken which can be real good or bad depending on location. Bell pepper, pepperoni, and mushroom pizza=was quite good, with revamped crust big difference. And actually had some god-damn tomato sauce on it finally. Kung-pao spaghetti=fucking insanely gross item with thick noodles. Its not really their fault, and wifey ordered it, told her not to. Its prob grossest item you can order.

CPK has fallen from our families list of restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Sergio R.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/19/2015,Simply good food! The pizza is great and love the Farmers Market Soup. Friendly folks and nice ambiance.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Cameron S.,"Berlin, NJ",7,51,1,4.0,8/12/2014,"We love CPK and with few exceptions we always have a great experience when we dine here. This isn't a 5 star dining establishment by any means but the food is very tasty and we come back often. We almost always get the Thai crunch salad and this time we had the flatbread with mushroom and spinach also. It was tasty but not worth the price in my opinion. Our Thai crunch salad was exceptional as always but was just a tad bit on the small side to fill us up. I think CPK should offer 3 different sizes of their salads for people with different appetite sizes. A size small, medium, and large size salads would be perfect as we tend to share our salad when we get one.  And of course the butter cake is to die for!!! Make sure you get it with a scoop or two of Haagen Daz ice cream however!!! YUMMY!! Mmmm Mmm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Michelle H.,"San Fernando, CA",28,13,1,2.0,7/10/2014,"Every few times I have been here, I have had poor service.  The waiter spends time talking to other waiters instead of servicing his tables effectively.  Food is only okay.  Bread is not warm, glasses are left empty for a while... Until he needs to come because you have asked others to get him for you.  Word of advice, don't go there unless you have time to kill as you most likely will not get a decent waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Beverly G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,5,2.0,5/10/2015,"So my bf and I decided to do lunch here. Thought it'd be nice to do the outdoor seating. The hostess was friendly and sat us down quickly despite the Saturday rush.  Our waiter Brandon took our drink orders. I was indecisive and it looked as if it annoyed him. He said he'd come back later to get the orders, which I thought made sense. We did order our appetizer, which didn't take too long. Our meals however did take longer than expected. Considering that I had ordered the chicken ceaser salad I didn't expect for there to be a delay on that. We had to remind the server a few times about our order of bread and second round of drinks. At one point that same hostess from earlier  walked by our table and coughed without covering her mouth.  This is pretty gross considering my glass of iced water was on the table uncovered. We had asked our server what the hold up was on the food, he seemed confused about why we'd ask. I understand it may have been busy and he may have been overwhelmed,  but his service seemed lackluster. It seemed as if he was more attentive to the tables around us. I know what youre probably thinking, that we were loud, obnoxious, and picky patrons. If that was the case I would have found his service understandable.   However, my bf and I were completely understanding of the wait and shitty service. So after asking him about the food, it surprisingly  came out minutes later.  It was delicious. At least until hours later both my bf and I experienced abdominal pain and diarrhea. Don't know if this was a coincidence or not but truth be told, Im not happy about my recent experience with CPK.  They even took my favorite dish off the menu. This place was once a favorite, now its just overpriced mediocre food at best.  Don't know if it was an 'off' day for the server but he should've not stayed out too late the night before or not shown up to work at all! Ugh!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Angelica R.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",3,111,38,3.0,7/2/2014,Place was okay in customer service. The food was good as always I wish the staff was a bit friendly,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Al B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,9/5/2015,Just go to yard house next door! Better food and service. Have had horrible experiences at this location. Bad customer service. I ordered curbside and showed up to find out they had no idea! Turns out they booked it for another day!?! Will not return. Food is mediocre at best,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Nancy L.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",77,45,8,4.0,6/15/2012,"I'm in love with there butter cake! It's the best dessert I ever had!..It's a cake that melts in your mouth when you eat it kind of like chocolate fudge but with butter cake, It's Sweet and filling, it can be a little sweet but I usually share. I like there pizza too but I usually just get it with pineapples only, but still really good. They have Hummus and I like it, it is well prepared with there pizza bread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Raffi I.,"West Hills, CA",207,245,658,5.0,11/11/2011,Had a great experience their. The food was good and the service phenomenal. Went their for lunch and ordered a Club Sandwich with Tortilla soup. Felt good going down in this weird cold weather we are having. I will go back again. Thank you CPK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
Christine A.,"Granada Hills, CA",288,490,1396,3.0,5/31/2011,"I don't think CPK's food is ""outstanding"", I think it fits in the same category as Olive Garden and other mediocre Italian places. I've ordered the spaghetti, linguine and clam sauce, and their carne asada pizza. Overall, it's just ""ok"". If you want GOOD Italian, walk about 20 feet away to Macaroni Grill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=220
