Clarissa Y.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",951,806,992,4.0,12/3/2016,"Funnily enough, even though I live in the heart of Cardiff I haven't actually been inside the restaurant. Instead, we ordered takeaway with Deliveroo so I can only rate the food! I've been to other TGI Friday's in the chain and when this restaurant was suggested as an option, I'll have to admit I was skeptical as I've not had good experiences with this chain. However, when the food arrived I was VERY pleasantly surprised! Everything was delicious! -- Times Square Big Share -- Jack Daniel's chicken wings, loaded bacon potato skins, and mozzarella dippers. The best thing about this platter were the chicken wings! Well cooked and extremely delicious. -- Cajun Cream Pasta w/ Shrimp -- Really enjoyed this! Great flavours and HUGE portions as well. I've tried bits of other people's food and everything seemed enjoyable (especially love the sweet potato fries, I will most definitely be getting those next time!). At the end of it, we were thoroughly enjoyed our meals and plenty of leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow. --- I can't speak for the actual restaurant itself, but from our Deliveroo experience, maybe TGI Friday's wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Bob S.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,4,,1.0,8/7/2017,"Monday night, pre-reserved table. Painfully slow ""service"" - hour and 20 minutes before appetizers arrived. It was an age before our orders were taken - so long that we started to wonder if our waitress had gone home. Other diners had been sat, eaten, paid and left before we'd even received appetizers :/ Appetizers were good - the Tennessee meat sharer in my case. 2 hours in.. my main course was quite possibly the poorest excuse for an alfredo that I've ever had the misfortune to eat. Bacon & mushroom, with no mushrooms, no cream sauce and barely any cheese. Basically just a bland bowl of pasta sat in it's own water with some bacon bits. Dire. If you like an alfredo then go buy it somewhere else.. anywhere else in fact, out of a jar would have tasted better. All the dinners that had veg came with raw squash that had maybe seen the inside of an oven for a few minutes. We eat at TGI Fridays often in the States - this UK version is way off the mark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Stacey F.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",188,41,78,4.0,3/17/2015,"It's a given that most would have already visited TGI Friday's - sat at their stripy tables and spilled Jack Daniels Sauce down themselves. Yet let me share a beefy secret with you... *whispers*  On your next visit tell the waitress - 'You'll have what Jack's having!'  *A burger from the TGI Friday's secret menu.  I won't spoil the surprise as to what it tastes like, or what it contains.  Just know it was delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Gareth M.,"Torpoint, United Kingdom",1,4,3,5.0,4/8/2015,You can't go wrong with TGI'S.  We love the place. Service is always friendly and cocktails are amazing. Food is great for snacks or meal. Kids love it too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Anna T.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",12,461,442,4.0,5/9/2010,"Thank God there's a new TGI Friday's in cardiff. Its only been open a week so I only have one visit to rate this on. Firstly its really big and split into lots of different spaces upstairs and down. Despite its size I think they may have been suffering from a lack of staff or a few teaching problems when we went because there were a lot of empty tables but we had to sit at the bar for 20 minutes before we got a table and that was at lunch time. It wasn't a bad wait though since it gave me time to try out the cocktail making skills and since the menu is so long it was lucky the barmaid had a few suggestions! Anyway once we got a table the service was quick and the food was perfect. Of course its just burgers and that kinda stuff but I'd defiantly recommend the ribs that just fall off the bone. There was a real buzz to the place and it'll be interesting to see if it lasts. Its far better than the Newport road branch, I just hope it lasts, though I really wish they'd stop the birthday chants!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Amy L.,"Newport, United Kingdom",18,15,10,3.0,8/25/2013,"It was busy despite being a Thursday evening in August - when there should be many less students about. (Cardiff is a notorious student town.) It took us about 20-25 minutes to be seated but we browsed the other restaurants in St David's while we waited.  Our server was friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our order to be taken (which she committed to memory) and for food and drinks to arrive.   I got a Holiday isle smoothie which was delicious and my friend had the Raspberry Crush smoothie - refreshingly tart. The rest of the drinks menu sounded enticing too, but I wasn't up for anything alcoholic today.  My main course was the 8oz New York strip steak with bourbon peppercorn sauce, which was served on the side. It came with a choice of two sides, so I got the cheese mash filled potato skins (they give you two pieces) and wedge salad. I also received a surprise serving of fries (I'm guessing perhaps the waitress mixed up my order of the potato skins as they were missing at first - but they quickly fixed this). The wedge salad was....bizzare. It was literally a chunk of iceberg lettuce drizzled with a slightly overpowering blue cheese sauce sprinkled with grilled bacon bits. The most difficult thing about it was taking it apart in order to eat it! Messy business.   The potato skins were better. The cheese wasn't melty like I expected, rather in a cooled melted lump in top of the skins but the texture and taste were still alright. The steak reminded me of why I am usually wary of ordering steak. I got it medium, but it was still too tough and chewy for me and the taste wasn't really there.  As the peppercorn sauce was so thick it didn't spread particularly well on the steak. The fries were so-so. I ended up spending £15 on something I'd rather not eat again. Overall: good drinks, decent service, good ambience (beware of birthdays though - if you want to come here for a birthday take note that there are probably 3 other parties here for the same reason, and yes, you will have to sit through the birthday sing-song 3 more times.) Would i come back?  It wouldn't be the  food that bright me back here. Rather than the high price for 'meh' food, I'd come here for casual drinks at the popular bar area. However if I had to come here for dinner, next time I would get the ribs with the Jack Daniel's sauce instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Christopher K.,"Butetown, United Kingdom",7,124,97,2.0,10/11/2010,"Now I'm not sure how to review this one. Did I enjoy it? Sort of... I enjoyed it mainly for the food. The food was fantastically delicious and left me wanting more after I finished (although I wasn't prepared to pay more because the prices were very high) the drinks were great although again very pricey. The selection of food is great and I found myself wondering which dish I would choose because they all looked great. I had the ribs and do not regret making that decision. Delicious! But to bring it all down it had to come to the service, which was rubbish in all honesty. I went in a group of 5 and they messed up 2 of our orders not cooking the steak properly and not adding the shrimp when they ordered a surf and turf. Plus the extra sauces didn't come. As far as first experiences go; this was the worst. The waiters and waitresses seem to be more interested in flirting with each other than serving the customers making sure their order is right. Needless to say I won't be returning anytime soon because I felt uncomfortable and didn't like the service. If I could take the ribs home in a take away bag then I would. You have to pay a lot in TGI Fridays for the food and drink which is worth it. But in terms of service it is dreadful. For me it's TGI time to go...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Natalie A.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",7,233,24,2.0,9/15/2010,"I have some great memories of TGI Friday's from cities all over the country, but sadly my recent trip to the Friday's in St Davids 2 did not live up to the same standards. Despite the usual TGI décor, I felt that this restaurant lacked a certain something that is found in the other restaurants, though I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Something about the lighting made it seem so much more dark and depressing that it should be. And the staff weren't nearly as up-beat and friendly as I remember them being.  Still, they do have a fantastic range of cocktails. Just a shame mine arrived with a little fly floating about in it. Drinks seemed to take a really long time to come, too, despite it being a week night and not at all busy. I can appreciate that such fancy cocktails require a certain attention to detail, but surely it doesn't take that long to fill a couple of glasses with coke?  My food was pretty good (I had the chicken fajita) but other members of my group were less happy: one of my friends was served barely-cooked chicken and next to raw vegetables. We spoke to the manager and he was very nice about it, taking my drink and the uncooked meal off of the final bill, but I'm not sure that's enough to see me going back again.  One more thing: while I really enjoyed my 10th birthday at TGI Friday's in Southampton, the two birthdays celebrated in this Friday's seemed - to me, at least - to be rather disappointing. Not nearly as good as they do it in Frankie and Benny's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
James C.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",10,335,182,4.0,8/28/2010,"I've spoken a lot about my favourite alcoholic drinks in my reviews here. Henry's and Fat Catz get a lot of my love and my patronage because of their fine range of drinks; they have a whiskey selection unmatched throughout the city. Metros gets a thumbs up because its drinks are obscenely cheap and do the job they were meant for (introducing you face to the floor at record-shattering speeds). The selection of drinks at TGI Fridays is neither expansive nor cheap, so why does it get my love? Simply put, a drink is more than just what goes in the glass. Presentation counts. And TGI Fridays can present a mean drink. It's obvious that the barmen and women at TGI Fridays know how to make their drinks, and that style counts a great deal. On the food side, it's standard TGI fare. Everything's basted in Jack Daniel's marinade, fries or cheesey mash comes with each dish, and at least three animals died to make one plate of food. The fries in TGI Fridays are the best part of any meal; there is always so much of them and they are always just so, so good. Especially when stolen off a mate's plate....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
Sam B.,"Castle, United Kingdom",11,138,212,5.0,9/9/2010,"Two words can justify the 5* rating - Ultimate cocktails.  These consist of basically everything that's wrong with the UK binge drinking culture in a massive fishbowl sized glass...... and it's brilliant. There's a huge cocktail menu here all around the £4 mark for a normal sized glass. Or for an extra £2 you can supersize that bad boy and lose your dignity at the same time. I sat outside the front with a few friends,  near a couple who were in the neighbouring Cafe Rouge enjoying a nice meal and a glass of wine. I admit that I did feel slightly ashamed when all of us sat down with massive, traffic light coloured monstrosities. But after one ultimate cocktail for some reason I chilled out a little. You also get treated to some top class bartending when they pour your cocktail, making it that little bit better. They also do ice cream cocktails, which are sickly but really nice. And for the more hardcore amongst you, it means you don't have to stop the flow of alcohol just because you want some ice cream. I can't remember exactly what it was called but it made me feel gloriously nauseous and had banana liqueur, chocolate ice cream and mashed up oreos in it. A good cocktail to drink was the Zombie, which is the traffic light one I mentioned earlier.  The food here's good aswell and I went for the tried and tested steak and chips. It was well cooked but a little pricey at around the £13 mark, especially as it wasn't the largest portion I've ever seen. I was satisfied with the food but I couldn't help thinking ""I could have had two cocktails for that......... """,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cardiff
