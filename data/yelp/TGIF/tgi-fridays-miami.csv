Lynette M.,"Miami, FL",226,98,258,4.0,7/22/2017,"Decided to come with my friend to TGIF to catch up ,and have some drinks. How it was a Friday night I decided to go inside as soon as I station my car in order to put my name on the waiting list. I always get seats by the bar at night or if I'm coming for lunch. Something that really surprised me was the lady in the entrance looked ,and she's like YOU have one seat avlaiable for you let me clean it took her three mins and by the time my friend arrived I was about to get seated. So they were very organized last night! Regarding parking, and location: it is located in dolphin mall it's by the entrance of the mall but more towards P.F. Chang's and about parking they have a huge lot.  As soon as we were ready to order we already get appetizer apps which I believe is 15.00 for ultimate night. We decided to try the NEW chicken quesadilla which were phenomena as well as the NEW Nachos forgot their names. But we didn't just get that theirs much more to order we had mozzarella sticks/ pon-head baked potatoes. Mostly came to pick up drinks so my friend had two peach sangrias ,and I had from the summer collection the frozen lava flow it was very delicious the only this is its super cold ,and refreshing for next I will drink it by the beach. Our server was very patient, and quiet but lacked on a lot of speaking.. ,and gave us no recommendations on what to have or try. We had to come across it on our own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami
Jordan D.,"Miami, FL",0,8,4,1.0,1/14/2018,"I would rather eat anywhere else than to ever eat at this establishment again.  The food was not even that great, and the waitress made a huge stink about the bottomless appetizers. The staff was extremely unprofessional as well, our waitress was beyond ridiculous she literally watched us from the bar to make sure someone from our party did not share their bottomless appetizer.

Yvelin R.,"Miami, FL",1294,413,2255,2.0,9/21/2017,"I've come here a couple of times but it had been a while since my last visit, so we decided to eat here yesterday.  Food was pretty decent but service was so so bad I probably will not return. Orders weren't brought as ordered either (onions on nachos, cheese on kids' sliders, etc).  Place was empty when we arrived and even after a few more tables got occupied it was never busy (early pm on a Wednesday).  It took 40 minutes to get the kids' meals. If you have kids, you can relate and understand how frustrating this was. The entire ""experience"" was almost 2 hours, way tooooo long for a simple early dinner.  Bathrooms were dirty, other customers complained of same issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami

Mauricio V.,"Miami, FL",69,98,48,1.0,3/9/2017,"The service here is appalling. I came here with my girlfriend and her family and sat down at a table. We were all interested in ordering drinks, but one member of our party is in possession of an old vertically-oriented (portrait format for you MS Word users) under 21 ID. According to the employees there, it is company policy (we did not see it in writing) to swipe the under 21 IDs to verify the license holder's age. But if the magnetic strip is damaged, it will not register your age on the device and you will not receive your alcoholic drink, even when the date of birth printed on the license displays a date that is at least 21 years ago. We protested their refusal to serve one of our members a drink despite the clearly over 21 date of birth printed to no avail with two different managers. Three of us had already had the drinks brought over to us, but we told them we were refusing service, yet they still charged us for our drinks when were getting up to leave.  TGIF has one of the silliest policies I have ever heard of. They will never again get my hard earned money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami
Jeanette P.,"Hialeah, FL",42,14,3,1.0,5/15/2017,Terrible service!you can tell the managers don't know how to run a restaurant and the servers are careless.i went with my bf and he had a government issued security id with his birth date on it (he's 23) and they would not accept it even though the restaurant next door did. I also had an issue even though i had my regular id. The server called the manager because my id is vertical and they had to swipe it to check if it was legit. After swiping the id the manager looked like she didnt believe it was me and asked what my bday was and i said the month and date.she continued to question me even though she had already swiped my florida issued legit id and i told her my correct bday. Very rude and will not be going back to this tgi friday. Customers shouldn't feel like they're doing something wrong for ordering a drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami

Service was terrible, waited upwards of 90 minutes for our food, finally served after multiple talks with manager. Orders were mixed up and my burger was cold. Ordered a water which never did arrive. Manager offered 20% off to compensate for poor service. I told him to keep the discount just give me the bill before I walk out. Of course that didn't occur until I walked up and told him again I was not waiting another minute. Terrible service and poorly managed. We will never go back.

Mallory A.,"Miami, FL",0,14,2,1.0,11/19/2017,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! I ate there today with my family around 3:30, well I should say I entended to eat because I didnt even get the chance to. We ordered two medium flat iron steaks, chicken strips, and a burger. It took over 30 minutes for the food even though the restaurant was pretty empty. The burger my dad ordered arrived to the table wrong so we had to wait longer for his food and when he got It and we began to eat I saw that my steak was well done so I asked the waitress if she could get me another that was medium because I hate dry steak. She took It and came back saying ""if you look at the middle of the steak it's slightly pink, you can look for yourself if you want"" lol what?! First off medium is not slightly pink, it's pink. Secondly It wasn't even pink It was brown in the middle which should be the least cooked part. Thirdly instead of coming back with the food that was clearly prepared wrong and pretty much being like too bad that's what you get think about proper service. Ive worked at restaurants before and I get it's a mistake but It was handled poorly. The chef ended up asking if I was willing to wait for another steak or if I wanted to order something else but by that time my family was almost done with their plates and we had somewhere to be so I went without eating. Service 101 you fix the problem instantly, apologize, and typically make up for wasting their time seeing as you're taking their money, you should make sure it's worth what they're paying for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami
Phillip H.,"Miami, FL",430,38,51,2.0,6/1/2016,"Date Night Log 601-001 It's Wednesday It's Endless Apps. It a hell of a good time to go to TGI Fridays. Oh yeah. Place is empty and you get seated. New specials are shown and boom we ask the question of questions. Are shellfish cooked on the same pan as everything else, being my wife has a shellfish allergy.  Boom hostess checks. No everything is cooked separately. Out comes the waitress. Offers us alcohol, I decline, offers again. This is where I start to have an issue. If I say No, then don't offer it again. I might be a recovering alcoholic, I may not want any, i may be poor. Either way let's move on.  Waitress comes back hey you ready to order. Boom we are undecided, so why not offer us the new shrimp and steak. Hold up the hostess didn't relay my wife has a shellfish allergy. I then smirked and said she can't have that unless she wants to die she's allergic to shellfish. Waitress is oh wow ok got it. We then order the 3 for all appetizer. (Fyi the mozzarella sticks are fried in the same fryer as shrimp) oh course the waitress doesn't think of that as we didn't know it was, so when we ordered it 1 minute after stating the fact my wife has allergies. We thought it was all cooked in separate friers like the steaks are in pans. Out comes the food, the food tasted amazing, the Pretzel with cheese sauce, the mozzarella sticks, and the Sriracha chicken. Oh yeah she like it spicy. We then get our entrees. I get the amazing chicken that's cooked on a board and my wife gets chicken pasta. The waitress asks us how's everything. We said good. My wife finished her alcoholic drink and the waitress insists of another. She declined but said are you sure. Again, I felt at that point I was at tootsies and not fridays. The manager came by and asked how was everything. Explained how my chicken is cooked and was amazing. Good person to have there. Actually both managers are good. Keep them. Then we finished our food, and now Diamond (Fyi that's not her name but at this point like I said I felt I was at tootsies so that would be a stage name) asked if we were ready for some Tennessee Whiskey Cake. Again I look around made sure I was at Fridays and maybe not on a prank show. I don't want alcoholic stuff. Boom we get the bill. Waitress explains about a survey. Wait hold up. Aren't you not suppose to talk about surveys and ask to give a high score. I'm only saying this bc in my job we can't do that.  After I pay, and start to think I realized why I am seeing such bad scores on yelp for this Fridays. That they have had issues and needed to get there scores up from what they have so they over do things.  Here comes the kicker. We leave walk to Hot Topic (yes a yelp for there will be coming soon) and my wife fells her throat funny. After 5 minutes boom allergic reaction we go back to Fridays she getting a reaction to shellfish. Remember those amazing string breaded cheese called mozzarella we ate earlier. Yeah boom allergic reaction. Cooked on the same fryer as breaded shrimp. Ambulance comes takes her away. The two managers I do have to say thank you for taking care of my wife, speaking to your waitress, and to the cooks about if any food was cross contaminated. Now not letting us know that everything is cooked separate besides fried foods was wrong on the hostess and waitress part. So if you have a shellfish allergy you can eat here. Just beware the tasty fries, mozzarella sticks.. you know what anything that is fried in a fryer.  Again the two managers get 5 stars. The place gets 2 because they didn't think of the safety of my wife when she explained twice of her allergies. This should be brought up in meetings and corporate setting. Because in the end of the day it isn't the impression you give me in the begginng it's the impression I get at the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami

I am a 34yr old man and was with a date when we were rudely asked for ID after we had been given the drink menu.. the bartender took my dates ID and gave it over to a woman with an old yellow ID card reader that looked like a Walkman and said the card wasn't scanning correctly with the machine so she couldn't serve her alcohol. We proceed to ask her to try again and she was not cooperating, I then gave her my ID to scan to see if it was maybe the card reader that was malfunctioning. Lone and behold my sideways ID didn't take through the reader as well. If it was the reader that was malfunctioning how did everyone else receive a drink at the bar?

mike p.,"Miami, FL",128,27,1,4.0,3/22/2017,"I had a terrible experience at the location at THE FALLS (see my review about that) and as a result TGIFs invited us to dinner at another location. We chose this location at Dolphin Mall. Dinner at 6pm on Saturday for 7 people. They did a great job. At first the hostess said the wait would be 45 minutes for a table and we were about to leave when the manager (a young lady, blonde) stopped us and found a table. The waiter was very efficient. Water glasses filled quickly and he manged to bring the orders out as we requested (kids' meals first).  Despite being a peak time there was no delay in the service and the staff was very friendly and professional.  My conclusion is that the managers at this location now how to staff their team and manage the place. The experience was a complete 180 compared to The Falls.

Joseph L.,"Hialeah, FL",0,6,2,1.0,12/8/2016,"We went here yesterday Dec 7, 2016 and sat down @7 pm the place was empty looked almost like a ghost town. We are celebrating my mothers birthday from the time we sat down the nightmare began. No one came to greet us for over 13 min when it is supposed to be 2-3 min  it was a waiter who never told us his name just took our drink order and apps and left he took another 12 min to brink our drinks and brought them one by one instead of all togeather. Then he finically takes our order our food didn't come for over 1 hr And again didn't come all togeather he brought out each dish one by one staggered every 2 min. You can tell our food was sitting under a heat lamp for a while and that it was cold and the taste was stale.  Then we asked him for another one of my moms cherry limeade he never brought her a new one just put some sofa in it and brought it back my mom said it taste like dish soap.He never offered or came by to refill drinks and we stayed thirsty all through dinner. So then I asked the next waiter behind me to speak to a manager and he asked what was the problem I told him he said he was going to get a manager and never did . The. I had to walk to the bar and tell them I wanted a manager and now. I tell the manager what the waiter did and his horrible service he said he didn't know anything and offered a discount. The whole meal should have been free for the worst birthday dinner in the world.

Today I tried to use a coupon and my co-worker bought an endless app and the manager did not want to honor it because it could not be used with the endless offer and I said I could understand .. Then I asked her to separate the tickets and she refused. I was very annoyed by her lack of professionalism and her face when she told us that she could not. At the end she honor it because she could not say no to the separation of the tickets. Each customer buys what they like and if you can not give a good service as a manager then you should not damage a good business as it is TGFriday...   You should study to become a manager, it is obvious that you came to that position not for studies or knowledge because you lack professionalism.

Alex H.,"Punta Gorda, FL",9,69,38,3.0,5/14/2015,"Not bad, not great just TGI Fridays and the usual stuff. While I got the new Jack Daniels sliders, the rest of my party got entrees. The sliders weren't bad at all and for sure hit the spot considering I wasn't too hungry. The sliders were good, but had a bit too much bread around the small patties. The cheese was good and the Jack Daniels sauce had a nice smoky kick. The French dip sandwich mom got wasn't bad either and my dad's parmesan chicken with Mac and Cheese was good as well. But again it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  Service wasn't bad either, our waitress was friendly and very sweet. She was quick and prompt and answered all of our questions.  Now why three stars do you ask? Because the women's bathroom was absolutely disgusting, for some reason the stall had dirt near the toilet paper dispenser and if was just gross. Again it was another situation where I should have mentioned it to someone but I just didn't. Though it may have been because it was Saturday and they were busy but it was still kind of off putting.  Again, it's a TGI Fridays it's not bad and it's not great but it's a good place to eat with family and just have a nice Saturday night dinner together.

We placed our drink orders, appetizer and food order at the same time since we already knew what we wanted.  Our drinks took about 10 minutes, and the place wasn't even full.

How do I know, I was splitting it with my wife since we weren't that hungry after the movies.  So she had two and I had two, and split the Chicken.  4) My sons' ribs were dry, overcooked, and barely any meat on them. I called the waiter over when our meal arrived and let him know my disappointment and our missing foods, he checked with the manager and the kitchen and told us yes, they gave our appetizer to another table, and he didn't know what happened to the salad.  He didn't seem to concerned about trying to make it right or try and make us happy.  They finally brought the appetizer (Mac&Cheese bits) when we were finished with our meal and it looked nothing like the picture in the menu.  They were half the size and way over cooked and burned.   I was totally expecting the manager to come over and see how we were doing since they had multiple errors and were very dissatisfied with the meals and experience.  He never made it over to our table, but the table next to us that had a young couple and a very pretty woman got all the attention.  The manager and about 4 other servers were constantly walking up to their table, chatting with them, etc.   After he brought us our check, he removed the appetizer but had an extra drink charge on my check.  I had to grab him and point it out so he could remove it.  This place has never been special, but bearable.  NEVER AGAIN!.  I will no longer dine at this TGIFridays.  Only reason for the 1-star they did a good job signing Happy B-day to my son.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=100

So to be fair & unbiased - I gave them the benefit of the doubt like my favorite old saying ""every dog has its day"" that day wasn't theirs... So i got there around 2200 (10:00pm) met up a couple of friends... the server got there quick, and she was very attentive. The appetizer spinach dip was excellent freshly made, the tortillas didn't taste stale at all. My friends ordered half rack ribs, sirloin steak & half rack rib with fries, and i ordered of course the healthy petite USDA 6oz steak with asparagus (gotta watch my figure) ... the food came out perfect! Everything was cooked properly, nothing was stale as it was before and it actually tasted good.

We get our food and everything. She asked us how everything was and we said fine. Well she forgot to ask for a refill......so another stare down game began again. We actually had to ask another waiter to get us a refill.  Food is done and I remember that I have my tgi friday's reward for a free meal. So my friend and I were gonna split everything. Cajun pasta + drink=1 bill Cajun pasta + appetizer=1 bill This means one of us gets a free pasta and only pay for the drink and the other pays for cajun pasta and appetizer BUT we had another coupon to use for that. So the cat and mouse game began at this point on. We were waiting for the waitress to come so we can explain this to her. 7 minutes later...we explain and I tell her I get a free meal with the reward and she says I need to speak to a manager so I said okay 6 minutes later...the manager comes I show her the email and she says I need to pull up the code from the website through my phone which will take forever 15 minutes later...I finally get the code and hunt down the waitress. she comes, gets the code and leaves 8 minutes later..she forgot to split the bill plus add the coupon on and says we need to talk to the manager again 5 minutes later..manager approves and we wait for our bill 7 minutes later..(stare down game) and we get the bill split with all the coupon perks but she gave my bill twice and my friends never came so we wait again 4 minutes later....we get the right bill and at this point we are so fed up by the service and the manager even gave us attitude when we showed her the coupons but come on times are tough.  The girl didn't even ask for a refill once, no forks, gaves us the biggest attitude, did not do her job, socialized with her coworkers the whole time, made us stare at her for her attention, and was just plain rude. NO TIP! We came one time again after that and ended up with the same girl. She was decent that time, but we actually gave her tip :) FOOD IS GREAT.

Andy B.,"Naples, FL",16,60,5,2.0,1/11/2009,"Perhaps it's evolving tastes on my part, or maybe it's that they completely overhauled their menu recently, but Fridays has really gone downhill fast.  The food is greasy, tasteless and some of the menu items are downright frightening.  Who fries Macaroni and Cheese or Green Beans & puts it out as an appetizers.  Only in America I guess!!! They have a limited selection of salads and the overall quality of the entrees has gone down.  The food mostly tastes of rancid cooking oil, not so good if you ask me. Service is OK, nothing really notable.  That's why I try to stay away from most chains or fast food joints.  We're in Miami, with the amount of high quality restaurants present here, surely you shouldn't waste your money on going to Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=120

Ordered from the section of the menu with smaller portions... because who needs the ""regular"" (read: massive!) portion anyway?!  Got a steak with ""gourmet"" mac-n-cheese.  Nothing AMAZING, but it did it's job, and was just the right serving- not to mention they cooked the steak properly!

By the time we got our food, our burgers were cold and we had to wait for our fourth party's entree for a good 5 minutes. When her chicken came, the server told her they were out of the mac n' cheese, a side our waiter had so eagerly recommended.  By the time we asked for our bill, they were closing up so I believe that to be the reason for bad service (tired staff) and no food.

Sweets M.,"Miami, FL",1,8,2,1.0,1/27/2014,"I can say I had been a Friday's customer for well over 20 years if not more. I am a frequent rewards member and every month would get something with the amount of visits I had. However, this all changed since November.  My last two visits to Fridays have been nothing short of a disaster. Back in November I went with my family of four and our bill was close to 100. Anyone who eats at Fridays will assume that must have been one hearty meal. Well quite the opposite; the waiter was HORRIBLE, SLOW, and not very familiar with the menu and the deals. Our food was cold, delayed they brought everyones meal at a different time, we ordered drinks from the bar and they could not have been more watered down. We had no water for the kids. No manager came to see us and the kicker was when I went to get the point on my card the waiter said he forgot so for me to go online and add them. I left there and called the next day to speak to a manager. She apologized and offered to have us back and I said no because this has been happening quite often the last couple of times ive been to Fridays. Well when the New Year came we were out shopping and my girlfriend decided to eat at Fridays. I forewarned her but let my guard down to what would soon be again a disaster. The bar smelled like absolute Clorox, the waitress was more busy talking to friends than serving our table. The burgers were cold, the orders were wrong, the chicken tasted like rubber...Again money down the drain, and a bad stomach ache for my kids. and, of course no manager in sight...how odd! The next morning when I had spent all night up with my daughters I called and asked to speak with a district manager. The manager came on the phone and after I told her I had a complaint told me to call 1800Fridays. I did, they asked me to not write a comment in Yelp until I would speak with the district manager. That was the icing on the cake. The district manager called me to say that he apologized for my experience but the problem was they were under new management and not everyone was trained. He asked again if I would come back and I said no..after speaking for a while he said he would send me something in the mail for us to go to another Fridays. 3 weeks later and nothing came. I am not saying I would have used it, but clear example that service at TGI Fridays at Dolphin Mall is not what it iused to be. With so many better options like Mojitos, Cheesecake, Buffalo Wild Wings (where the chicken tastes real), Texas de Brasil do not choose Fridays. YOu will have bad service, cold food, watered down drinks and absolutely horrible follow up by management...Wake up people and read the reviews on Yelp!!!!

Frank M.,"Hialeah, FL",5,192,56,2.0,10/13/2015,"Please closed your doors. The worst food i had in the past ten years. We order the turkey burger and it was bad, so bad that the bread was cold. The appetizers looked and tasted from the microwave. Last time i came to your restaurant was about 5 years ago and now i know why i waited so long too vomit. Please save your money and go to golden arches. The two starts i gave you was for service, she was actually very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=60

Kassandra H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,5,2,1.0,5/5/2015,Worst food ever. The lemonade was made with bitters and water from the bar. The blueberry Long Island was just as bitter. The food was horrible and they gave me the wrong order twice. The bartenders have no idea what they are doing and the chefs are just as bad. But at least out waitress was amazing. Cute short girl with a red bandana. Forgot her name. She was the only good part of this whole experience here.

The Manager ""Roberto""was horrible, very rude and insulted me by asking me if the food he was bringing to my party was just for me!  The waitress ""Marisol"" overcharged me by $30 and could not explain to me ""why"" by giving me 3 different answers. I expected the 'endless"" appetizers to be $10 unlimited as advertised but she charged me PER plate (4 plates of appetizers) and never explained the deal to me!!! and refused to give me a credit OR apologize!.

It's dark, the tables are sticky and old, and for some reason it's always wet. Bathroom is all wet too. To top it off, the service is never good. I've had unresponsive waiters, half full shots, and bartenders lie about the prices.  You're better off going to the food court.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=60
Luisa O.,"Miami, FL",74,28,17,1.0,3/11/2017,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon to have drinks with my sister, although their menu is not my favorite, my sister insisted as she comes here quite often. Unfortunately as we were ordering drinks my sister was told her ID needed to be swipe on a little machine they have to verified her age. She is over 21 but she has a vertical ID and the magnetic strip is faded. The first manager came, intended to swipe ID and said it will not work, we asked her to see her date of birth to verified ID and she said it was fine. We assumed my sister will be getting her drink as this is the first time they mentioned such policy, which by the way is not in the entrance, neither drink menu. As I got my drink and my boyfriend, we asked what about her drink to our server and he mentioned he couldn't serve her the drink. We asked to see the manager and another manager came with the machine, intending to swipe the ID again. As we explained her the other manager had tried to do it and since ID is faded on the back she left not saying anything about my sister not able to get the drink. We would it have left right there, however after asking our server on her drink status he bought another manager and this manager said they base on policy need to be able to verified ID. We asked what is the machine supposed to said and she said the age. So we asked her to verified date of birth on ID which clearly states her age but she insisted the machine needed to verify it. So I asked her why is her policy no stated in the door for users to be aware before they even consider going in. She had nothing to say, we requested the bill and she mentioned we still needed to pay for the other drinks that were bought to the table, even though we didnt touch them. I think it is ridiculous they don't have this policy listed on their door, i would not have wasted 30 minutes of my Saturday otherwise. Based on this situation, i will never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=40
Claudia L.,"Miami, FL",12,30,17,1.0,1/16/2016,I have not been to this Friday in a while but the portions are smaller and the service was not what you would expect from such a reputable chain restaurant.  We waited over 45 for our food.

Tiany M.,"Miami, FL",34,4,,1.0,3/26/2017,"I gave it a star because there's no lower rating possible.  Tried to have dinner there with friends after the movies.  We were a party of 14, they said they could accommodate us.  However, from sitting down to having our food order taken was a 50 minute wait.  That only happened because we went to see the hostess to inquire who would take our order.  By the time the food came out another 45 minutes later most of it was wrong and 2 of the younger kids had already fallen asleep without dinner.  Dessert was another fiasco with another 50 minute wait, 2 more of the kids in our party had fallen asleep due to the long wait.  When we asked to speak to the manager all she could say even though she could see 6 out of the 8 kids asleep was that our wait hadn't seem that long.  Horrible service, horrible food, and management is part of the problem!

Mario R.,"Miami, FL",32,188,80,3.0,12/6/2014,"I haven't had one of their entrees in a while since they had fallen off a bit, but I may have to give one a try and update this review later. That being said, The pick there for 15 is awesome! I love the corned beef sliders, tuna crisps, and fried Mac n cheese!  Aside from that, the bruschetta is decent and the drink prices are reasonable. I want to go four stars, but entrees sucked real bad last time I came and it's a low end chain, so three stars with a possible 4 in the future. Hell, they had a great salmon pasta dish many years ago, so if they just put that back on the menu I'm in! Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=40
Andrea V.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,5/22/2016,"By the time our waitress Lea came up to greet us we had already looked over the entire menu & knew what we wanted for apps & entrees (so we waited about 10 minutes before a greet). She asked us what we wanted to drink and walked away mid sentence without offering appetizers or asking if we knew what we wanted.  She comes back with our drinks & asks if we want an appetizer. We let her know we're ready to order our entrees as well. Some time later our entrees come..no appetizer. Lea never comes to ask if our food is okay...we had to wave her down & she approaches our table suddenly wearing lipstick (: (so she had time to apply make up yet she forgets to ring up our app). She asks us if we still want the app, we say yes. We then hear a manger lecture her about her mistake for a few minutes instead of resolving the problem or approaching us to apologize. We finish our entrees, waited another 10 minutes and the appetizers come out. My bf's cup was empty for the next 4 times she walked right by it without offering him a refill. We finish the apps and wait what felt like 30 minutes before she comes up and asked if we wanted dessert. We decline & asked for the check. She drops the check, we notice she charged us for the appetizer, & adds insult to injury by circling the suggested tip with a smiley face....my bf had barely taken his wallet out of his pocket when she returned to pick up the payment.

Jorge B.,"Miami, FL",40,95,30,2.0,5/26/2016,I was extremely disappointed in the cheeseburger I ordered which was cooked well done instead of the medium rare I ordered. The pot stickers were also way overcooked to being crispy and not in a good way. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was the service was pretty good.

Upon walking in the hostess tries to seat me at the bar, yet the area wasn't even clean. Since I told her I had bags in my hand I got to sit at a booth. Took about five minutes for the server Tito to come, and when he did, I ordered the bourbon barrel chicken with Mac n cheese and broccoli. The chicken was so small for a boneless breast, it was smaller than my fist. The Mac n cheese wasn't too tasty and it was more of Mac than cheese. I was more annoyed with the high school kids sitting behind me who were so loud, I wanted to get out of there so bad.

I never received my order only half of it and was unaware of last call when the server never came back to bring my food or check to see if we wanted our last round. The manager gave us our tab taking off the item we did not receive (obviously) however, did not make up for the poor service. At my restaurant the management would have made up for the lousy service and tried everything to keep us as a customer. The bartender nor manager could have cared less. I will never step foot in this establishment again, at dolphin mall there are many choices and on this day I made a bad one by coming here on my day off. I never complain as being in the biz however when I receive HORRIBLE service it really pisses me off as I ensure excellent service to my patrons.

Debi K.,"Manhattan, NY",335,1,,1.0,2/6/2016,"Worst experience I have ever had at a TGI Fridays. I was a part of a group of 4 who all had issues with our meals. They brought cold food for half of our table and the WRONG food for the other half. Our waitress was extremely slow and put our orders in wrong. When she brought out the correct side dish, it was literally swimming in butter to the point where I had to pour it out into an empty water glass. The manager could see how disappointed we were with our food and made sure not to stop at our table as he was making his rounds through the restaurant.

Vanessa M.,"Chicago, IL",125,23,2,4.0,7/2/2015,"This was my first time ever going to TGI Friday's. MY husband has been multiple times. We showed up late after work on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. Always a good start :)  Our server was very quick and brought our drinks (water) right away. We were ready to order just a few minutes after sitting down and she was ready to go. My husband ordered the chicken and shrimp sizzler with twice baked mashed potatoes, and I had the steak + spinach sizzler (with squash and a caprese salad). We also ordered side salads, which came out quickly.... which was great because we were so hungry! Right as we were finishing our salads, our entreés were ready. As you can see, I was impressed with the speediness! The place was fairly empty, but in my experience of late night eating that can sometimes mean extremely slow service. Not in this case :) So our food was pretty good! Nothing crazy and spectacular, but still good for this type of restaurant.  I was, however, surprised by the prices of this place (being my first time there). I was shocked to see almost every entree/burger/dish was over $10! I guess I was expecting Friday's to be a Applebee's/Chili's kinda place, which I still believe to be true, but to at least have similar prices? I don't know. In conclusion, we give a 3 for good food, 5 for awesome, prompt service... bringing the total to 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami?start=40
