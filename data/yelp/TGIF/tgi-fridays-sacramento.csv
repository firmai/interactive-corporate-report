Ed S.,"Fort Hood, TX",12,114,6,4.0,6/27/2009,"Staff is what keeps this place from being a 5 star, as far as I'm concerned. Good hours, and they're accomadating, for a decent price no-less. It's a Fridays, so what can you say about the food except that it's same as the others, for better or worse. Plus they're the only place I can buy the JD sauce around here, so always will be a fan of that stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Janette L.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,99,51,5.0,1/9/2009,"I probably liked this meal a lot because I stuffed myself 'til I could hardly walk back to the car, but I probably liked it more because it was 100% free. My boyfriend paid for everything - and it was well worth the money, in my opinion.  We started with the appetizers - pot stickers (which were delicious to me) and quesadillas (weird).  I took one bite of those and stopped.  Looking forward to the main course, I had the chicken fingers and fries, which were delicious.  I love seasoning!  Finally, we shared a bowl of dessert.  I can't think of the name right now, but it was great.  The decor was kinda bleh, but the food was so good it was okay.  I'd go back for sure! =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Nani V.,"Sacramento, CA",294,445,301,4.0,12/29/2007,"Went here three times in my life-time. First time was a couple of years ago for my friend's 21st Birthday. I just remember sitting up near the bar and sipping on all these tasty drinks. Yes, I was pretty buzzed. I still have pics of us sipping and doing weird poses! Fun night!  The second time was earlier this year with my older sister who was in town. The wait staff was pretty good at making sure we were okay.  Third time, I went for lunch with an old friend a few months ago. We both ordered the same thing. Their Boneless Buffalo Chicken. YUM! It was more than I expected. I had to take some home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Vincent K.,"Emeryville, CA",420,813,70,2.0,3/28/2009,"For some reason, I used to think quite highly of T.G.I Fridays.  But after this last time there, I'm no longer impressed.  Even if I did happen to stop by TGI on a friday, I would not be thankful.  Instead, I'd turn to whoever is the brains behind choosing this establishment to dine at.   Oh wait, that was me.  Well, it was either this or applebees and since the applebees here doesn't have happy hour, TGI just seemed like a good idea at the time, and to be honest, the appetizers weren't that bad.  It was just the main course that didn't quite do it for me.  We had the following: -3 way appetizer - green bean fries (always a favorite) potato skins (fattiest one of them all), and chicken wings (nothing impressive) -Jack Daniels flat iron steak - apparently just having the JD sauce is an extra $3, but who knew.  the sauce was good, but the steak was not. -Jack Daniels bbq ribs - again, sauce was good, neg on the ribs.   another plus, is that the place opens till really late, so I'm glad they were able to have us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Kristen L.,"Manhattan, KS",111,200,23,2.0,5/24/2009,"I went to this Fridays about a year ago with my boyfriend for lunch. Our waitress started out awesome, got our drinks and took our order as soon as we were ready. Where she went after that I'm not sure. I spent the entire meal thirsty because she was no where to be found for a refill. The food is just ok. The drinks are good, but you could go somewhere else for better drinks, food, and definitely service. Went back a few days ago to give it a try again since I had a giftcard. The service was no better. The food was worse.  Forget it, go somewhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Joe M.,"Woodland, CA",71,142,289,4.0,9/1/2009,Usually end up here sometimes cuz its open late. I always liked the food and beer. Sometimes fries taste a bit on the warm side instead of hot,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Lester R.,"Arnold, CA",46,183,9,1.0,3/8/2008,"When I was in college and if it was one of my roommates birthday we would go to Farrell's Ice Cream as a treat and overall funicity.  When I was a third younger I once took my kids to Chuck E. Cheese for my birthday and it was a good entertainment value for them.   This time for my birthday I chose Friday's as I had not been there in at least 10 years and my two younger tax deductions (17 & 20) were bringing some friends along so I wanted to provide some entertainment value in the same vein as Farrell's and Chuck E. It appears Friday's has not really evolved from it 's late 70's early 80's days in terms of decor or customer service and the entertainment value now comes from the Friday's staff at your table and not animatronic fuzzy characters on stage.  In addition, it appears Fridays has been passed by the Applebees and Chili's of the world in decor and menu offerings. While waiting for our table, we had the pleasure of hearing one of the hostess screaming (seriously) the name of some guests on the waiting list.  When it came to my name, she called mine out but apparently had expended all her energy on screaming out the name of the previous guests and she could only utter a half hearted  ""Lest  "" Our appetizers came out but Megan our server had forgot to bring out the silverware.  We then experienced a server change and were handed over to Chris.  Chris was attentive but never bothered to clear away our appetizer plates during the whole meal and only removed the appetizer serving platter when I placed it on a chair behind me.  (hint,hint) Midway though our meal, a lady with no visible name tag or indication she had any affiliation with Fridays was walking by our table and stopped and asked how our meal was.  I shall call her Mimi because she was wearing a top similar in color and style as the character from The Drew Carey Show.  I told my wife I was going to start doing that and comp meals for tables of people as I walked back and forth to the restroom. (Just before I left of course).   There were other interesting characters such as the food expediter dressed in a shiny silver puffy sleeve blouse and rounded tummy bringing food out to the tables.  I did not get to try that job as I did not know where the microwaves were. The food was bland and uninspired no matter how much money Guy Fieri from the Food Network sold his soul to be in the Fridays commercials for.  I had the Jack Daniels Flat Iron Steak with garlic mashed potatoes.  Flat was the taste and thanks for the Jack Daniels sweet sauce to make it halfway edible.  I have had garlic mashed potatoes before and this was not close.  The reviews of the other 5 in my party were mixed. In the end, I had wished we had gone back to Chuck E. Cheese.  I think I am good for another 10 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Chris B.,"Sacramento, CA",66,112,4,4.0,2/17/2009,"The people that work here are what makes this place. If you are lucky enough to get one of the six or so good servers that work here you will have a good time. The food is decent, and everything is quick. A typical meal from start to finish takes less than a hour. Great spot for big parties, and the drinks are not too bad. I like that they make the ""Ultimate"" drinks instead of just the standard sizes. Ask for Chris's section if you come at night and want the best experience you can get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
O M G.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1724,8477,4.0,2/2/2009,"Horrible parking lot. Or maybe it's just the people that try to park in it that make it horrible... And, is the sky blue exterior paint of the restaurant intentionally bad?  Most of the time the host(ess) will open the door to the restaurant and greet you. That's nice, right? The service is okay, food at decent prices. Those crispy green bean fries with the wasabi ranch is REALLY good. I also find that alcohol easily outweighs the bill. For the most part, Friday's on Howe is a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Linda Z.,"Anchorage, AK",53,115,16,3.0,9/30/2006,"I have been visiting this establishment at this location for about four years now, not because it's especially great but because they tend to make good drinks - not to watered down (although, there has been times.) Tonight I and a friend went after work and were seated pretty quickly even though the place was pretty packed. We were helped very courteously however, there were little things - like the waitress at least eight years my younger kept calling me ""hunny.""  We also tried to order one of their new featured appetizers, the fried mac & cheese but we were told they were out. TGI's has also changed their drink menu, I usually order a rum runner & B normally orders the hurricane - these we were told not supposed to be promoted but would be made if insisted upon. She did request the hurricane and I tried the mojito (this was super weak like lime water on ice.) The waitress suggested something called a ""Black Superman"" which kinda tasted like a rancid grape soda but was definately more alcoholic. We ordered the potato skinny dippers which only came with about eight potato wedges... and a GIANT plate of cheese. Neither of us are ""double dippers"" so it was a really lame appetizer. We finished our meal with salads, the food was basic. The atmosphere was CRAZY LOUD and the wait staff was a little lax but SUPER NICE.  All in all it's a safe bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento

Ricky D.,"Sacramento, CA",6,50,,4.0,11/7/2008,"The Jack Daniel's flat iron steak is the best ever.. The other stuff is just average. The drinks are very good, but the female bartenders seem to have that too good for you attitude. I have been here many times and rarely get any eye contact from them. I like for people to give me eye contact male or female when taking my order or serving me. That would be my main grudge on this place. All in all a good place for drinks and appetizers at the bar; don't expect much more than that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Zetsubou S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,4,3.0,3/31/2008,"I don't know why my friends always insist on going here on weekends, I never really found it appealing.  The wait can be horrible sometimes and very random.  It's always packed, loud, and I always seem to have trouble focusing on a conversation in there.  It's like it's helping me develop ADD. I don't know what is up with this place and the amount of oil they put in their pasta dishes.  It's either grease or olive oil but that doesn't matter because after five minutes, you can see small puddles of it gather up on top of your food. There's no longer a triangle of competition around them since El Torito shut down, which used to be my preference out of the three.  Still, I'd pick TGI Friday's over Chevy's because Chevy's is a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento
Tanisha B.,"Sacramento, CA",269,173,66,4.0,1/19/2009,"Me and my girls get together and come here for Happy Hour, when we're all in town. It's become our usual HH place. We've been to others and they don't compare.  The prices are decent.  The have varying bar specials on a chalk board, by the cash register. The food here is always consistent, not necessarily amazing but consistent. They have good specials. The same with the drinks, their consistent. The staff has always been friendly.   The police are generally there on Fri and Sat nites, in case someone gets out of line.  There's a pretty mixed crowd each time we go: old, young, preps with button ups, dreads with white tees, etc.  And it never fails, every other time we go somebody buys us a round of drinks. Clearly, we gotta work on our odds in '09, we need it to be e'r time.  Lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento

Sunny L.,"Sacramento, CA",719,661,769,1.0,3/8/2008,"If I came here again, it would mean that this is the only restaurant that is open in ALL of Sacramento. I really dislike this place. I came here severals time before; however, it just got worst of the years.. (Am I getting old?). Well, anyways, the last time I went, it was during lunch. The place was not packed, so it should of been fine getting seats for 6. When we entered the building in the waiting area, the place smell worst then my girlfriend's armpit. It stank like a locker room. 'I just threw up in my mouth a little bit'... (Dodgeball quote). Well, we waited about 15 Minutes for 6 people. The service wass really mundane. The waiter seemed like he just woke up. How nice eh? When the food arrived, I looked at it (Salad), and I felt ripped off... A ~$8.50 Salad only had the amount of salad that an $1.99 Side order salad had... I entered hungry and I left hungry. And the greens in the salad weren't really green... (meaning not fresh).

Nicholas R.,"Sacramento, CA",2,13,,1.0,5/11/2008,This place sucks. The food is terrible and tastes like cardboard. There are police inside on duty every night. WHY?

Mina H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,21,4,1.0,9/19/2007,"I had the worst experience at this TGI Friday's. My boyfriend and I went in and ordered some burgers before 9 pm. We were seated in a corner away from all the other customers. We waited 45 minutes (!!) for our waitress to reappear, all the while trying to find someone to help us. Another waiter had to get her for us and she told us ""the computer had messed up"" and they hadn't prepared our food yet. (Yeah right, she forget about us otherwise she would have told us earlier). Anyway, we wait another 20 minutes and the manager comes and apologizes and says we get free dinner and dessert. We wait another 20 minutes. Finally our burgers arrive and we're so pissed at the terrible service that we ask another waiter to box our food and we just leave. Ughh I am never going back there. You can get the same burgers at any other chain restaurant and without the headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sacramento?start=20
Nancy R.,"San Francisco, CA",278,237,9,5.0,2/24/2009,"I'm a huge Friday's fan let me just say that first haha. This location never lets me down, I always get great service from the friendly staff, food's delicious, and they're open way late I discovered even on a Monday night. Last night me and my friend were coming from Boardwalk and were STARVING but didn't feel like BK or any of that crap. We showed up 11:47pm and were promptly seated, and weren't the only ones in the joint so that was nice. I guess it was happy hour according to our waitress so instead of paying $12.50 for the sampler appetizer and only getting small portions we paid $12 and had 3 full sized appetizers. We shared that and the pan-seared salmon pasta for $13, I think? She got a beer and the bill was still under $30 with tax. AWESOME! I love this place it's always good times and good food and cheap! Especially during this economy it's great to know one of my fave restaurants in the area is offering deals even now, they even emailed me a buy one get one free entree that doesn't expire til the end of next month :D and the more you buy they'll give you free food on a card I still have.

Serina T.,"San Diego, CA",48,113,7,4.0,10/23/2007,"TGIF is fun to go with a group of people.  They can usually accommodate for groups over 10. It is fun because you can be loud, laugh, and even joke with the waiters and it is ok.  The drinks are reasonably priced for the amount of alcohol put in them.  The food is great...even for a chain restaurant!  Lack one star because they usually bring you a wrong order if you order your meal with ""special"" instructions, and sometimes the drinks can be way too strong.
