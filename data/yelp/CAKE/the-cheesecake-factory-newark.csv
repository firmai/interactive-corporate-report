Torey C.,"Wilmington, DE",39,63,64,3.0,4/8/2013,This place is over-priced. I say this based the price of a cosmopolitan made with Skyy vodka $11.50 REALLY!!  I enjoyed my salad and the service was great. I was taken back with the price of the drink. I will go again and just order water next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100
Stephanie H.,"Elkton, MD",5,50,69,2.0,11/18/2012,"For the money, the food from this place is really not all that. Great presentation, but the cheesecake is actually in my opinion not good at all. I have tried vanilla, key lime, the peanut butter cup one, and regular. Couldn't eat it. The newest Moroccan dish is sub par, claims to be marinated and just tastes blah. I'd rather get something from inside the food court and save my money for shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100
Tracey H.,"Landenberg, PA",14,32,46,4.0,9/2/2013,"Today was our 3rd time at the Cheesecake Factory. Everything I've ever had is better than good. The menu is extensive ... Mexican, Italian, Asian, American, omelets, small plates, skinny meals. Tonight I had the fried fish sandwich on toasted brioche. It was really really good. The weather was lovely so we sat outside. Our waitress was excellent. Can't wait to go back and try something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100
Chad M.,"North East, MD",10,30,9,2.0,8/5/2010,"The service was good, the atmosphere was good but the food, although pretty to look at, was bland. I ordered the Orange Chicken, my wife the Chicken Marsala. Neither were served with any real flavor, so much so that I wondered if it was the intent to make bland entrees so that the Cheesecake would stand out in the end? Regrettably, however even the Cheesecake was not that impressive. My Cheesecake was average at best. In the end I felt the entire experiance was disappointing and I regret waiting 15 minutes to be seated at 2pm in the afternoon on a Sunday. I have no idea why people would stand 45 minutes or longer for a dinner service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100
Wayne R.,"Newark, DE",0,12,1,4.0,5/31/2010,"My family and I visited the new Factory at the Christiana Mall this weekend for my daughter's birthday.  Had a good time.  The Memphis Burger was big - pulled pork and coleslaw on top of a regular burger - and quite tasty.  The Dutch Apple Caramel cheesecake for dessert was really good as well. I actually thought the service was better than average, as no less than four different servers came by and waited on us throughout the meal.  It seemed to be a point of emphasis that none of the staff walking by allow a beverage to get too low.  Meanwhile, our waiter was also prompt and friendly. It felt like the bill was a little on the pricey side after figuring out what we ate, but that's the deal with this place I guess.  It's an upscale chain restaurant and you should definitely appreciate that going in.  It was packed though, and routinely has long lines. I think we'll definitely go back for other 'celebratory'-type meals.  Just feels like that sort of place.  Enjoyed it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100
Christina K.,"Sicklerville, NJ",14,10,1,2.0,2/9/2013,"Surprisingly, the service was very bad.

T. C.,"Pemberton, NJ",0,3,1,4.0,6/29/2011,"The food is excellent--we had the fire roasted artichoke appetizer to start.  It was cooked to perfection and paired with a very tasty dipping sauces that supplemented the artichoke. The main entrees were also superb.  We chose the Luau Salad and Bar-b-que Salmon. Both were well prepared and presented.  The salad had a great combination of fresh ingredients and the serving size is very generous. The BBQ salmon was exquisite.  It's so easy to cook seafood improperly--to cook it too long or not long enough, use the wrong seasonings or make poor choices for sides.  Everything was right in this case: The salmon was perfectly cooked. The BBQ sauce was tangy and flavorful but not overpowering,  so it didn't eclipse the delicate taste of the fish. What cannot be understated is the quality of the service. The staff were friendly, professional and attentive.  What was really special was the personal attention from the manager.  When notified that the young child with us was cold, he raised the thermostat and returned promptly with a Cheesecake Factory T-shirt and stuffed penguin toy.  She couldn't have been more pleased.   All things considered, it was a superb dining experience and we will certainly return again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100

David W.,"Middletown, DE",1,39,,2.0,5/16/2011,"Very poor, especially when compared to other outlets in the same chain. The Christiana restaurant is much smaller than the average Cheesecake Factory and as a result it is unbearably crowded and the wait times (which one understands will be long going in) are exasperated. Staff is not up to par with other locations. Part of the Cheesecake Factory experience is top notch waitstaff, but not here. We were also disappointed by the food. Not to the level of quality one expects from CF but at the same price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100

Melissa C.,"Wilmington, DE",40,7,8,4.0,5/5/2010,"Two girlfriends and I visited the new location at Christiana Mall this past weekend, and we were very happy with our visit. It was a gorgeous day and we were able to sit outside without too much of a wait. Our server was friendly and efficient, and our food was wonderful. All three of us ordered pretty light fare, in anticipation of concentrating of dessert. We shared Arugula Salad, Beets with Goat Cheese, Greek Salad, Crispy Artichoke Hearts, Ahi Tartar and Shrimp Scampi Crostini. Everything was beautifully fresh and tasty. The menu is as think as a book, so in the future I will try to decide what I'd like to have before going. The cheesecake was AMAZING. Key Lime, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, and some other amazing chocolate monster served with ice cream (I cannot find the name) were ordered, consumed and greatly enjoyed. The only things that keeps The Cheesecake Factory from receiving the 5th star from me is that you definitely felt like you were in a chain restaurant and the three of us together spent over a hundred dollars and we didn't even have alcoholic drinks, making it an expensive afternoon nosh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=100

I love the chicken Thai lettuce wraps because the sauces are delicious! Don't EVER get the fried mac and cheese (my 15 year old ordered this dish) It is horrible AND expensive didn't even touch 4 of the 5 huge fried balls.

Charlene W.,"Newark, DE",0,10,1,2.0,2/26/2016,"This was the worst service I have experienced. We waited 40 minutes for a table for 5. While waiting I saw strollers wheel chairs and sleeping babies being held in a mothers arm. Standing room only. Once we got seated it was so dark you needed a flashlight to read the menu. 3 people ordered appetizers, there food came fast. So while they ate 2 people sat and watched, starving after waiting 40 minutes. Once the other food came, it was horrible. Burnt fish and under cooked vegetables   The complaints lead to the manager coming to our table. They tried redoing the vegetables but they were raw as fresh produce. She offered me an alternative but I refused. Corn was so under cooked I couldn't swallow it. I was offered a free cheese cake. I don't like cheesecake either. It was my granddaughters birthday.

Cristina C.,"Newark, DE",50,65,13,1.0,1/15/2014,"Let me start with this: I am 30 years old.  I went into this restaurant yesterday to use the gift card I received for Christmas.  I ordered a glass of Chardonnay (because even if they switch it up and bring you the house, chances are it will be decent).  I handed my ID to the waitress and she looked at it and informed me that it had expired (a week before-- on my 30th birthday)......  The waitress proceeded to shrink down to the floor and tell me that she was unable to serve me because the ID was expired. She told me that she could get into a lot of trouble.  I am not sure what the link is between her getting into ""a lot of trouble"" and my ID being expired...? I am not underage, and I was not driving a car, so how exactly could she get into ""trouble"" ?????  I could see if I had no ID at all, but it clearly stated my DOB being WELL OVER the legal drinking age.

I usually get a sandwich they have it's basically a blt with turkey and avocado (can't remember the name whoops). But everything is always great.

Thomas S.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,5,5,1.0,3/19/2015,"I was here with my family to enjoy a good dinner on a Saturday night.  I've never been to this location before and I most certainly won't be returning.  For starters, we had a crackhead waitress.  No, I'm serious, our waitress was a straight up crackhead, she probably was high while we were there.  She took our drink and food orders, and she never came back to our table.  She avoided us the whole time.  Some other waitress brung our food out, some other waitress gave us our drinks.  When we finally saw her long after we we finished eating, we asked for a refill. She said this direct quote ""I'll have the manager bring it to you"". Now I sense racism and she've been avoiding us because of the 'black people don't tip' stereotype.  We never got the drinks by the way.  After waiting for an additional half hour, we stopped her again while she was trying to avoid us and demanded the bill and some boxes.  We were finished for about an hour and never got any refills.  I hate this restaurant and won't ever come back!  I hope that crackhead waitress they have overdose in the bathroom on whatever it is she's shooting in her arm.  The table behind us was a black family too and they was having the same problem.  Sucks for her because I always tip at least 15%.  The food is good by the way.  If you don't want to be racially discriminated against, don't eat here.  They will judge you solely because of your race and won't do their job while you have to watch them take so much care of everyone else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=60
Michelle M.,"Wilmington, DE",9,85,17,2.0,2/13/2014,"We weren't sure what to expect from this place when we went there...knew it was a chain but how could a place that specializes in cheesecake possibly be bad? right? There are several reason why: 1.) they have a menu that is over 7 pages long! How can you do anything extremely well if you have that many damn items on the menu. From tartar to burgers? Seafood to tacos? Just to expansive for the cooks to get anything 100% spot on with cooking techniques and flavor/seasoning. 2.) they have a dish there that is the most caloric pasta dish overall out of all the nation's chain restaurants. Ummm...hello?!?! 3.) their cheesecake, while yummy, should have a warning that each slice is a MINIMUM of 1,100 calories. 4.) the service is subpar with many young kids that are more interested in flirting with one another and checking their smartphones than effectively waiting on tables. 5.) Salads are overdressed to the point of being slimey and mush. I just don't have the energy to go on. It is a chain restaurant that's main goal is to cash in on as many customers a night as possible. Even though they are no cheap, you are still getting subpar food with half ass service.

Last Saturday we had a business luncheon, and there were 7 of us. We all love this location because of the service. Well, that changed drastically! The original waitress, Judith, was so rude and disconnected that after 20 minutes of waiting for her to take our drink menus, I had to alert the store manager!  The manager immediately apologized and replaced her with a new waitress, Pam! PAM IS A POWERHOUSE! When you visit, ask for PAM! Although she is younger, her attention to detail and knowledge of everything is beyond her years! She started from the drinks and keep it moving! We had a ball, and she was extremely generous.

She knew the menu very well also (which is extensive). She continued to refill my husbands drinks without even asking! I ordered the chicken bellagio and my husband ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta. Our chicken was cooked to perfection and we both enjoyed the flavor of them very much. The menu has numerous chicken, pasta, drink and appetizer items. Menu here also has the ""healthier "" choices if you desire too. The chocolate hazelnut cheesecake is my favorite so of course I ordered that for desert! Yum yum! We ordered fried mac n cheese for appetizer and we loved that as well.

You have to wait long to be seated, and long for your food. Honestly, when you go to a good restaurant, this is expected. If possible, make reservations if you don't want to wait. I think they only do reservations during weekdays. Call ahead to be sure. Also, good parking is hard to get! The beginning of the parking lot is always filled.

Na T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,49,,4.0,1/2/2016,"There are some people who get on their high, hipster horses about chain restaurants -- blah blah blah something about authenticity blah blah blah...Who cares if the food tastes good? And, generally speaking, the food at the Cheesecake Factory, while likely considered predictable and uninspired by the clichéd foodies of the world, does indeed taste pretty good.  The wait times, however, can be a legitimate buzzkill as CF doesn't offer call ahead or reserved seating.  The waiting area is essentially nonexistent and has horrible flow.  Also, the Christiana Mall location does get pretty slammed, which is a common feature  among most other CF locations. If you get there before 4 pm on a high volume day, the wait time should be pretty bearable. The food quality is not too shabby; the overwhelming menu offers something for just about everybody except for Anthony Bourdain wannabes, and who wants to break bread with blowhards like that anyway? I enjoy the grilled steak tacos, guacamole, and dynamite shrimp. My boyfriend tears up the dynamite shrimp and is somewhat fond of the bang bang chicken and shrimp. For dessert, the chocolate tower truffle cake is a necessity. Seriously, the fate of collective human happiness rests upon this slab of chocolatey goodness. Whenever we visit, we receive pretty decent service. Hopefully that won't change any time soon.

It was very busy in there, so I honestly thought it would've been longer. Our waitress was nice, but often times disappeared for times, but again, it was really busy, so that was fine. I was told by a family friend that the portions weren't huge, but when my plate came out, it was HUGE. I had no idea how I'd finish it, haha. The food was SO good. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. My nephew got an omelette that came with toast and home fries. Again, huuuuge plate for him too. Of course, you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake. We took ours to go. I'm now just eating mine (Godiva chocolate cheesecake) and am in love. If you're a chocolate lover, I highly recommend it.  The only ""downfall"" were the prices, but I definitely didn't think it would be on the cheaper side.

Pages and pages long... I can barely decide with a normal menu B - floor is always super slippery in the Christiana Mall CF. Not sure how the poor wait staff and especially patrons in heels do not fall and kill themselves. They should have definitely gone with a non-slip surface instead of the really polished tile. (Although I would never condone this myself, if anyone is looking for a good slip-n-fall place for a fast bunch of lawsuit bucks, this would def be a good option!) Our appetizers included the mac-n-cheese balls (yummy comfort food in true form) and fried calamari (most tender calamari I've ever had is always at CF.) Followed by a variety of dinners, which were all very good. And wrapped up with several different kinds of cheesecakes. (My favorite is always the banana creme... so light, fluffy and refreshing after a full meal), but you can almost never go wrong with any of their flavors. Our waitstaff was friendly and efficient, and gave us several little gift cards at the end that are good for a free cheesecake with every $30 purchase (customer appreciation) good through 10/3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark

I usually get Sheila's chicken and avocado salad or the farfalle with chicken pasta dish or sometimes even the bistro shrimp pasta...all really yummy! I even recommend the miso salmon, but ask them to cook it lightly...just so that the fish is flaky when you get it and not hard as a rock. Trust me, this request is do-able...my parents do this all the time and don't have any issues. And as for dessert, I like a lot of their cheesecakes and their cakes...you just have to go with what you're craving.

For the entree I elected one of their new specials. I've always been a chicken parm lover and their chicken parm pizza is like an upside down chix parm! BIG round traditional chicken parm (when it arrived I thought oh crap! It's literally a pizza, but it's not) topped with a angel hair pasta with a lemon herb cream sauce. Very tasty. What really got me was the size. I'm on leftovers. So 2 dinners later and I still have lunch tomorrow. And I'm an eater! And then cheesecake of course. I had the raspberry with lemon cheesecake -wow!

Did not like the chicken in my chicken quiles( the nacho egg lookin thing ) which is part of the brunch menu.

There are however some spots I don't care to be seated at. Specifically the back wall booths directly behind the servers station. First of all its noisy and the traffic is insane from all the back and forth. What also draws me to the Factory are the diverse menu options.  There's something for everyone. The brunch menu is pretty good. The huevos ranchers are a little different from what I'm used to but was tasty nonetheless. The waffles are fluffy and while they don't have a traditional chicken and waffles dish my creative friend simply ordered chicken tenders to go with. The mini crab balls delicious.

Also, he would repeat our every order he in exact detail back to us for approval. Perfect.  I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp entree with a glass of red wine. The rice that came with the meal was unfortunately overcompensate and a little crunchy. The sauce on the chicken and shrimp was spicy and extremely flavorful however! Finally, you cannot go to the Cheesecake Factory and not get some Cheesecake. I ordered the key lime cheesecake a la mode.  This was literally heaven on a plate. It was so delicious that I had to slow down eating it to truly enjoy the perfect proportion of whipped cream, ice cream and the cheesecake on my spoon.

Service: for once we didn't have to wait 2 to 3 hours to be shuttled in a cavern of restaurant.  (Everyone table's conversation is amplified, jumbled and combined into a unpleasant roar.)  We sat down, ordered, and somehow it took almost 10 minutes to slice $21 worth of cheesecake (3 slices) and bring it to the table. It may sound petty, but if I am ordering around 3000 calories of cheesecake at a price that could feed a family of four for dinner, you better ridiculous white pants/shirt combo in high gear and serve those slices of cake quickly. Attention to detail: The waitress came back to see if my family were enjoying thier fat-pills and she boxed and bagged my daughter's leftover slice of cake.  This morning, my daughter naturally wants her cake for breakfast!  (I'm guilty of leftover chinese food for breakfast) Now what reminds me of stoner McDonalds workers spitting in the food was the layer of macaroni noodles crushed into the base of her leftover cake????  Really?

The good news is, you can stalk patrons in the bar area, as that seating is first come first serve, and I've had decent luck doing that at other locations.  Also, the portions are very large. The lunch pizza and salad is VERY filling, as well as the pasta, and Renee's Special (half of a turkey or chicken salad sandwich, a salad, and the soup of the day. If the soup doesn't sound like one you want you can substitute for fries). My only ""gripe"" has been that the last couple of times I have been the caesar salad has a lemony taste to it, even my mom noticed it. Not sure why that it is.... People really shouldn't complain about the calorie count or the price of the cheesecake. First of all, it's at a restaurant, so anything here is going to contain more calories than if you made it yourself, it's the reason you shouldn't eat it every day! Is $7 steep for a price of cheesecake, I guess that depends on who you are asking. If you had one of their drinks at dinner, you probably paid about that for it. Basically, you wouldn't pay that much if it wasn't delicious.  Overall, this is one of the better chain restaurants you could go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=80
Anne Marie S.,"Manayunk, Philadelphia, PA",184,33,12,1.0,12/31/2013,"Extremely poor customer service by the location manager.

The service is poor and the servers do not treat EVERYONE the same! I ordered breakfast potatoes with my brunch meal that tastes like they were cooked next or with meat. I do not eat red meat or pork. When I told my server that the potatoes tasted like meat and weren't  good. She said ""Oh yeah they cook potatoes on the same grill with the meat!"" Then she walked away and did not come back for at least 20min, She never offered to correct the order or asked how we liked everything. Additionally she didn't refill coffee or our mimosas at all. That was my last visit. I know go to brunch at Michele's in Dover Downs cost way more but food and service is better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=80

We arrived at around 3, so we did not have to wait. However, it seems that an hour+ wait time is not unusual.  The menu was gigantic, with many options to choose from. We ordered nachos for an appetizers and received dry, sad looking nachos with zero taste.  When we all got our meals, we all agreed they were very bland (we all got different meals) and disappointing. With all the hype this place seems to get, we were all expecting the food to taste good. We decided to try the the cheesecake, which was good but not great.  I felt the prices were too high for the quality we received. The wait staff was okay, and the place was clean and had a nice ambiance. Other than that, I won't be back and I'm not sure I want to try another location after this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=80

Sporadic W.,"Charlotte, NC",157,377,1149,3.0,2/20/2015,"Went for happy hour from 4-6pm yesterday. Appetizers and drinks on the happy hour menu are $5 and small plates range in price from $4-7. Our table ordered mojitos, cosmopolitans, skinny girl martinis, fried Mac & cheese balls, burgers, buffalo chicken blast, artichoke heart, bread & butter is complimentary, and I think there was something else for happy hour, but don't remember. Burgers were received well. Buffalo blast was mediocre, it's not chicken wings, apparently the chicken it shredded and mixed with batter or put inside a wonton wrap and then fried, so there isn't much chicken. Table favorite hands down was the macaroni and cheese balls with marinara sauce. Everyone at the table likes artichoke and we were all sorely disappointed when it came out; it looked old roasted and dry, and was equally bland and very chewy. We sent it back to the kitchen.  Drinks. Mojito had lots of mint and was delicious, so we ended up ordering a second. Skinny girl martini, didn't try it, but the person who ordered did not mention anything about it, but decided to order a second, so I'm assuming it was also good. Cosmo, the person who ordered this liked it, but it was a bit of a fiasco. The drink came with the customary salt around the edges which was not requested, it was sent back, they then poured it from the salted glass to another glass hence taking some of the salt with it, which was again returned and remade in a new glass. That item was also order a second time. Desserts, unfortunately are not a part of the happy hour menu at all. So the slices are pretty much $8/9 each, which is fairly ridiculous. I know most of them are specialties, but still a lot per slice. One friend ordered the lime/lemon meringue cheesecake, which was almost gone before we left. She loved it. I ordered Chris's outrageous cheesecake which was equally delicious and took half home with me, and our other friend had the strawberry cheese, which she said was good as well.  We all would definitely return for happy hour, the happy hour menu is both impressive and extensive, unlike other restaurants that just have 3-5 choices, is tasty, and service is friendly. Even though we returned items to the kitchen, there wasn't any backlash. Our server remained professional and courteous, even if she was thinking something else.

Lauren W.,"Sydney, Australia",200,268,264,4.0,7/9/2013,"I confess - I'm a huge fan. Say what you will, I don't care.  Cheesecake Factory's, like many chains, are very similar in all of their locations. Christiana is no different, except perhaps a little bit smaller than others. I've been about three or four times now, and every server has been very good and very patient. I feel like the food at Cheesecake is so consistent. I really can't remember ever having anything bad at any location. I've always gone for lunch, and it has never been more than half full and so we are seated right away. There is also an ample amount of outside tables, but it's right next to the entrance to a busy food court in the mall.  Highly recommend this place, very solid option for lunch or dinner. Like I said, you can pick almost anything that sounds good for you, and it will be delicious. I tend to go for their pastas and sandwiches. Most recently I've had their cuban sandwich. It's their version on the traditional, but very tasty. Historically I haven't been a fan of sweet potato fries, but theirs were awesome! Perfectly crispily cooked. I'm also not big on dessert, but their red velvet cheesecake is the only thing that changes my mind. I think the only downside to this location is the parking. The lot is fairly shallow right by their entrance, and so you often have to park far away. Once you consider the portion sizes of their meals though, you'll want to park far away to walk it off!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=40

Of course I love the desserts!  This has been a great addition to Christiana Mall and has ample seating although it isn't the largest Cheesecake Factory.  The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-newark?start=40
