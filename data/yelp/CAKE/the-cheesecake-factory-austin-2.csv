Adaeze E.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,90,151,4.0,1/11/2018,"I had a light dinner here - mostly because I was craving sweet potato fries and I wanted a place with a lot more options than a regular burger joint would have.  I had a Caesar salad and the avocado rolls. The rolls were pretty filling so I packed 3 halves to-go. The salad was very Cheesecake Factory typical. The service, however, was really good! Both the guy who got me seated and my waiter were friendly and courteous.  There wasn't any wait like I've experienced at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants which is good or bad depending on who's asking. All together, it was good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2

Sarah H.,"Wellington, FL",89,113,253,3.0,10/26/2017,"I hate to come to Yelp to write a bad review BUT I'm totally dissatisfied with my Cheesecake experience yesterday. My son has swim class off Bee Cave so I decided to treat myself to two of my favorite things from TCF; pumpkin pecan cheesecake, and their French country salad. I looked a hot mess after the pool so I called my order in. Customer service was great, from my phone order to picking up, AND I got a front row spot at the mall for once.  The anticipation was killer on the drive home, I contemplated taking the cheesecake out for a bite while stopped at a light. I refrained because I didn't feel like teasing myself. I get home, take a bite of cheesecake before I open my salad - AMAZING, everything I've been hoping and dreaming about. Then I decide to tear into the salad. I LOVE the dressing so I drizzled every last drop on that shizz. I start munching, eating mostly spring mix with plenty of dressing, saving the best for last. I get to the bottom layer of greens, and an so upset to see the lack of components that make the salad so yummy. I literally recall 4 pieces of asparagus, and very little goat cheese. This is an $11 salad, so I definitely felt ripped off. Had I dined in I would've sent it back to be remade, but I was 18 miles away, and stuck with it. Damn you, salad maker, damn you. Your salad making skills are weak af.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2
Brian S.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,251,80,3.0,12/8/2017,"It is a cheesecake factory so you know what you are getting.   Our waitress waa not too sharp but competent enough.   The portions are always huge, the food is always good but not great, the menu is enormous and there is something for all tastes.   I am not a CF fanboy and only go when others want.  It is ok but nothing special...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2
Jennifer N.,"Austin, TX",85,424,2629,2.0,3/17/2017,"I love me some Cheesecake Factory, but this one must be missing the mark for being attached to the mall.  So parking would be terrible if you are trying to come here just for dinner, since they are located next to the movie theater in the mall. I only come here when I'm already in the mall but there are other better options so in reality I only come here when other people in the group want to go here. The North Austin location is hands down much better. The service here is hit or miss, I guess they don't really care as much I'm not quite sure, and the food always has a problem. Maybe their oven is too hot? But everything is always burnt. The bread is hard as a rock and burnt, the biscuits on the chicken and biscuits were like hockey pucks. The price isn't cheap so for the price you are paying and the giant portions of sub par food, I'd say your better off eating in the food court.  But the cheesecakes are probably still a solid decision, since none of it is actually made on site, but I can't say for sure this location hasn't some how messed it up, since by the time it's dessert I'm over the entire experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2
Gina H.,"Austin, TX",427,243,1492,5.0,6/16/2017,I am thrilled to eat at this location everything was great except the Beef medallions  was a little  tough overall good. Parking easy especially lunch crowd. Janne is our server attentive  and polite  clam chowder is to die for... Salmon was very good as well. I will try more of the menu upon my return. The kale salad served with the crusted salmon was tasty and loved the way it was cooked. This location is at the Barton Creek mall which is off mopac and loop 1. I ordered the lemonade is not tart but perfect the way lemonade should taste. I would let everyone know they do get busy since they are right next door to a movie theater so just to tell you serving can be a bit of a wait.

Wayne N.,"Austin, TX",61,587,133,3.0,7/10/2017,"Surprisingly, despite living for 27 years now, this is my first trip to any Cheesecake Factory. That's pretty shocking considered how popular it is to many people. A friend gave me a gift card here for helping him out, so figured now is as good as ever to try it out. Although I wasn't ecstatic about my visit, I will say I can cross an item off my to do list of food things every person growing up should try. That said, as much as I appreciate the calorie info on the menu, it's kinda disgusting how unhealthy everything is, especially since the portion size is pretty normal sized...that said it'll help you make some better health decisions cause the taste that you get is marginal difference. The bread is pretty good. Normally I reach for the white bread and though the sourdough baguette is alright, the brown bread with the oats is pretty good. A little pat of butter makes it great. And as for what we ate? I got the chicken madeira and steak diane combo - the wife got the herbed salmon and shrimp scampi. The chicken madeira as their signature dish I would have expected more from. A razor thin chicken cutlet with cheese and chicken wasn't that impressive. The mashed potatoes are buttery and chunky with the red skins, so I appreciate the all natural feel of it. The steak diane is good - sirloin tips with a bit of heat and creamy sauce. Salmon is perfectly cooked and flaky with some herbaceous notes. The shrimp scampi was the favorite of them all - though it tastes more like roasted shrimp than any shrimp scampi I've ever had. Weird it didn't come with noodles on the combo plate either. So the food is pretty good, cheesecake slices are huge, but just can't help but think given what else is in Austin (and even within similar genres), there's better to be had. Sorry to be a local snob over the chain, but hard to argue with the truth....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2

Food comes out fresh and hot, the cheese cake is some of the best I have had any where!  The 2nd time we went 9 people in our party we waited over an hour and still did not get a table, they where busy but they seated a few tables of 4 witch if they had have waited would have given us the 2 tables we needed!

Drishti W.,"Cypress, TX",443,26,20,4.0,2/21/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a family favorite!  Service: 4  Food: 5 Ambience: 5  The only reason I'm docking a point off service is because of how busy they are. The servers always seem to have more tables than they can handle but are sweet regardless.  With their huge portion sizes, the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. This is not the place to go if you're on a diet haha even though they do have a Skinnylicious Menu for those looking for a lighter fare. Everything on their Skinny Menu doesn't taste quite as rich as their regular menu but that makes sense considering it lacks butter and such.  Another reason I enjoy Cheesecake Factory is the wheat and sourdough bread that comes for FREE with your meal! The bread is warm and I always land up eating more of it than I should.  My go to's at Cheesecake are their Picatta Chicken and their Godiva Cheesecake. Both these items deliver in quality and are ALWAYS fantastic regardless of which Cheesecake Factory I go to.  Props to this family favorite for keeping up with their consistency all these years.! We will always be coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2

My hubby had the reuben sandwich and it was very flavorful, not soggy and more than enough to bring some home. My mother in law had a  chicken caesar salad and it was huge.  We started the meal with mandatory avocado egg rolls and finished the meal with the original cheesecake topped with strawberries.  We enjoyed our meal immensely and our server was awesome.

Old 3 stars: Usually I really enjoy this specific Cheesecake Factory but recently it seems they are just throwing who can wear a uniform into being a server. My last three experiences have been less than adequate. The last one though completely blew me away with her rude tone and inability to understand our order.  She seemed polite at first but as time went by she had a frustrated tone. We ordered something they ran out of and I was a little upset but accepted it. Her response ""oh yeah sorr----y"" was what made me question her. After this she messed up our order and then at the end didn't offer us second drinks, immediately wanted to give us a box and made me box my food (I don't care if I had to do it I just know they do that there and I always liked that).

Russell S.,"Houston, TX",333,3,1,2.0,7/20/2017,"Wanted to get a warning to Vegans or people with food allergies. This location has no problem serving foods without following your requests. Our visit began with a 40 minute wait for edamame. The server came by and offered us free cups of soup for inconvenience and blamed the slow service on the computer system going down.  When we finally received our order, they served our veggie burger which we ordered dry with mustard on the side, fully loaded with mayonnaise. No mustard to be found. We waited 20 minutes with no sign of our server. So battling between ethics of eating the eggs in mayo or going without lunch, decided to scrape off the mayo best we could and eat the burger with ketchup.  We told the server and she asked what our problem was with her. We told the manager and he seemed to not care. Now I am wondering if our pasta was dipped in butter instead of the olive oil as we asked. Lucky this wasn't a food allergy or we would be off to the hospital. Just be careful when you eat here.  They really don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2
Lisa H.,"Berkeley, CA",0,5,3,5.0,9/16/2017,"Well I came in dressed in my gym clothes because I planned to work out afterwards. I was greeted kindly and with a smile by the hostess. I wanted a particular booth that was somewhat quiet. The host gave the staff person the directive to find such a booth for me, I followed.  She took me outside of the inside dining area, and pointed to, not a booth, but a table closest to all the chaotic crowds that was trafficking the mall. I asked to be placed in a booth that was quiet and away from lots of people she was taken aback a little so she stared at me not understanding. She asked me to repeat, I did so. I went back inside she followed me. She said, ""All of the two-party booths booths are taken,"" implying that I have no choice but to take what she's chosen for me.  That would never do for me, I would've driven away and gone elsewhere. But instead I looked around and found an empty booth in the corner close to the bar, no one was in it apparently it was a ""four party booth."" I could see the struggle in her face... Number one, I was not ""four people,"" and number two, I was dressed in my gym clothes. I understand.  But I was not going to be any longer than an hour. So I let her know that that's the booth I prefer. She said, ""let me go see if my supervisor approves."" Or something to that effect. She began to walk towards the host and I followed...really in case there's a short conversation against my sitting there. She realized I was behind her and so she pointed to the booth without a word so that the host could see which table it was. The host said ""OK."" So she led me to the table, I said ""thank you"" genuinely, but she just walked away. I felt a little chill; and it wasn't the air-conditioning. I hope she wasn't upset but if she was, perhaps there's more customer service learning to do on her part.  My experience became a more positive one when I met my waiter, Castro. He was upbeat and kind. He was funny, light, and very creative in this banter with me. I hadn't been to this restaurant in a long while in fact I used to go to the one up north in the Arboretum often years ago. This is the first time actually sat down in this particular location. I usually get either the salmon dinner or the salad and pizza. The salad was well-dressed, there was not a leaf of lettuce that did not have Caesar dressing on it, the right   was crisp to the last bite, and I don't croutons but they were really big and enticing. They were toasted in such a way you could get a crunch and  wouldn't break your teeth. I tried one.  Since I was getting the lunch special which was a salad and a small pizza I didn't want to load too many carbs up. By the time I had my slice of pizza I was already full.  So now I have pizza for dinner since I got the rest of it to go.  There was no attitude toward me about my reading and writing during my meal.  I could take my time I think. I spent about 45 minutes to an hour at my booth. Castro remained kind in a non-strained sort of way, it was genuine. I left the restaurant with a light heart grateful to have a little privacy within the public crowded mall.  The restaurant space inside manages to have their own ambience apart from the mall chaos. I recommend it. It is a good place to unwind and have a nice meal after a days worth of shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2

Wish they made that into a plate. Best thing on the menu ENTREE: Chicken Romana - basically chicken parm with angel hair pasta Chicken Bellagio. yummy lightly breaded chicken cutlets on top of parm sauced noodles (pesto notes) and topped with prosciutto topped and arugula Was stuffed and asked for boxes, they box it for you. Was kinda happy they didn't push dessert. offered yes but not pushed as much as drinks which i'm sure is a bigger profit margin.

Amanda R.,"Austin, TX",99,18,4,2.0,6/6/2017,We love Cheesecake Factory so when we were at the mall today we decided to stop in The hostess did not greet us. We actually had to greet her before she would say hi.  We were sat and we're not greeted by our server for almost 5 min. We were actually talking about getting up and just leaving and she finally showed up.  The food took a long time. It was after lunch time and I'm not sure why it took so long.  The food was so disappointing. Flavorless grilled chicken. Fries that were warm but tasted old.  We got the jambalaya with extra sausage and chicken and we could hardly find one piece of sausage in it.  We will not be back to this location for the bad service and less than mediocre food.

Bhagyashree B.,"Austin, TX",42,20,14,3.0,4/1/2017,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory at this particular location 3 times and feel compelled to write a review now. The only reason I revisit it is for the fresh bread and ofcourse the delicious cheesecakes. The restaurant should really sit back and re-evaluate their customer service. The first time I visited, our table was switched between 3 different servers. They did not do a good job coordinating with each other resulting in an hour's delay to get our order. They were out of the falafel salad that we ordered so we switched to avacado toast. The toast turned out to be burnt black and had to be sent back. Dulche le leche cheesecake saved the day! On our second visit - everything went ok but the server did seem a little distracted. Mango key lime cheesecake saved the day! We were at the Barton Creek mall today and decided to eat there again. This time our server forgot to bring our appetizer but charged us for it!! We had to tell him about this error, he didn't even realize it until then. Tiramisu cheesecake saved the day! Food it too expensive and not worth the service we get. Plus I don't like the fact that smaller/half portions cannot be ordered. But that's something you can't change about the franchise. I have been to the Cheesecake factory at other locations and been treated very nicely as compared to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=20

Amanda H.,"Wilmette, IL",0,5,,2.0,2/27/2017,"My children and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory last weekend. Our server was initially very attentive, until our food arrived. Unfortunately, there were several hairs in the flatbread that I ordered. When our server finally came over to check on us, I made him aware of what was on my plate. He acknowledged this and offered to remove the dish, but issued no apology. He never returned to the table to check in on us again, refill our drinks, or offer an apology. When he finally returned he brought the check and said that the wait was long because he needed to notify his manager to remove the charge for my food.  I am really disappointed in the lack of customer service and service recovery. No one from management came over to offer a personal apology or to figure out a way to make it right.

Omar R.,"San Marcos, TX",1,14,16,4.0,12/8/2016,"Walking into the Cheesecake Factory it reminds me of a cruise liner's restaurant. I don't know why. Maybe because the layout has a lot of curvature. Glancing around, the restaurant looks really taking care of. Very whimsical in a professional manner.  Michael, my waiter, was quick to serve my table. (I timed it btw) as he quickly brought my drink and a side of bread with butter. He was knowable about what's on the menu, very helpful for any first timer. Also adding I never had an empty cup. So far so good...now I wait for my order. (FOOD) I ordered something simple, the Americana Cheeseburger with the side green salad, a sweet tea and an order of the original cheesecake. ( Of course I'm going to get a cheesecake, it's the freaking Cheesecake Factory).  Out came the order and it looks fantastic.  Americana Cheeseburger was great. The potato crisps as the garnish was a well addition to the burger, it had a nice little crunch to the burger. The top bun was lightly toast with their secret sauce spread (not bad) it had a light sweet taste to it, but went well with the burger as a whole. The grilled onions might have been a little over cooked. (Personally I was never a fan of onions, so...). Ordering this burger you will not be disappointed, its a simple classic.  The green salad is what you think it is, romaine with light ranch dressing and a tomato wedge. It was good. It was a salad.  The cheesecake was excellent. I'd be disappointed otherwise, because obviously reasons, right... The experience was great. Will I come back again, yes I would. Recommend? Yes.  Don't let bad reviews or even good reviews make your decision. I just told you my own experience. Try it out for yourself and you be the judge. Good luck.

The cheesecake itself is very good and the perfect texture. The coconut crust is also amazing as well. The food is usually a 5/5, but the service is a 3/5.

We understand that the bartenders can be busy with the whole restaurant but it took about 15-20 minutes to get a double whisky with water. We came on a late Monday night with a pretty empty dining room.  Second, as we were leaving we decided to get some last minute cheesecake. Being super excited, it took a minute for the THREE people behind the counter to even acknowledge us. We were acknowledged by the guy (unfortunately we were unable to get his name) with him saying, ""they'll be right with you""... He then walked away to make small talk with the hostess.

Danielle W.,"Austin, TX",32,45,9,2.0,5/17/2016,"I am hesitant to write this review.  The server was lovely and thoughtful and my Diet Coke was never empty which is basically a miracle.  But we go out to eat because food is delicious, much more so when you don't have to make it yourself, and that is where I ran into some problems.  I ordered a burger off of their (way too) large menu.  So many choices.  When your menu has ads for other items, you need to trim it down a bit.  The server said it could be cooked to order and didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for rare/medium rare. After a moderate wait, the food came and I ate the French fries first because obviously fries lose that special something when they get cold and they are just never the same.  Then I cut into my burger and it is super well done. Not a hint of pink to be found, at all.  The server decides that this is the perfect time to transport to an alternate dimension, fall in love, have children, grow old, and then come back to this dimension and check on us. I tell her about the burger and how I can't eat it since it is wildly overcooked.  She asks if I want a replacement. I say no because I had filled up on the bread and fries and since there was the long wait until she came back, my body got the memo that it is full. So she brings out the receipt and my burger is still on it. I ask her to remove the burger that I couldn't eat and that she took away and just charge me for the fries.  I have never seen someone look so lost and confused before.  Ten minutes pass. A manager comes over and starts talking about the burger. Saying it is a delightfully tasty entrée and that he is sorry it was mixed up. I said I was sorry as well but we would really like the check now please.  He comes back with another burger and tries to give it to me.  I explained, again, that I didn't want the burger. I was full and it was unnecessary and it wasn't even the right burger.  Fifteen minutes later, we finally get the updated check. They did comp my entire entrée and fries but that was not the issue.  I would have happily paid for the fries because I ate the fries. I left my tip and moved on with my life.  Honestly, this has happened at literally every Cheesecake Factory I go to.  My order is always screwed up, no matter what I order. This was my first time getting a burger and it surely will be my last.  Probably even my last time at any location, at least for a good amount of time.  This one is pretty but a bit cramped since it is in the mall.  Nice server who still was tipped heavily because she didn't do anything wrong.  Maybe speed service up a bit? Nobody likes to wait thirty minutes for a check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=60

Another thing was, I ""watched"" the waitress write ""NO MUSHROOMS"" and my food HAD mushrooms in it. NOT her fault... it's the drugged kitchen staff working in the kitchen. Lay off the weeed guys.. Now that that's over with... Nikki, our waitress, was phenomenal. What a sweetheart and attentive waitress. She has a heavy Texas accent, was on top of her game as a waitress, and knew her menu!!

I tried the crab cakes....a giant 10-inch tall salad that looked like a beaver hut and tasted super yum.....the fresh yet conventional salmon dinner with fries....the enormous plate of nachos big enough to feed a pee wee football team....the chocolate cheesecake....and the strawberry cheesecake. Oh, and the hand-squeezed strawberry lemonade.* Service was phenomenal. There was even a crazy moment where a new person was being trained and the trainer would stand behind the trainee and write down on a little pad of paper what needed to be spoken aloud. I felt as if I were in a Vaclav Havel play for a moment there.  There is marble, marble everywhere, and even marbled cheesecake to eat.  I can't say I would go here for a date night, but if I were ever in the mall with friends or family, and got hungry, I would definitely choose this place over any other restaurant in the Barton Creek shopping compound, including CA Pizza Kitchen or Abuelos.

Zumar did everything he could to expedite the meal, he kept checking in the kitchen, he made sure our drinks and bread stayed fresh, he even comped a piece of cheesecake for the wait.  I'll give them another chance simply because of Zumar's service.

Ninja C.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,2.0,2/3/2016,"i LOVE this place. ive been eating at this restaurant in general since i was a wee lady. The problem came with my orange chicken when getting it TO GO CURBSIDE last night. Man, these chefs must be blind because it was not only burnt but it had so little sauce i swear it was a disgrace. I have ordered this entree not kidding at least 100 times and these amateurs managed to do the unthinkable (ew). I will never order this from them again and they should be shunned from even thinking they know how to cook such a great entree.

I would always look forward to eating here... now I could really care less for this establishment. I expected just OK food, but what I was served was super salty, werid cuts of meat and below average dishes.  Came here out of convenience since we were shopping in the mall. Spacious location & all indoors. We wanted something lighter since most dishes here are quite heavy so we ordered the Ahi Tartare, Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Thai lettuce wraps.  The Ahi Tartare... a nightmare. The raw tuna was not even diced/sliced properly.. The pieces were like half cut, but still stuck on to each other like links of fish? Will I get sick from eating this?? And the seasoning was also heavy, heavy on the soy! The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was not any better either. The server told us it would be mild spicy. However, it was a lot spicier than predicted and the dish was SO SALTY, I needed to drink so much water! The Thai lettuce wraps was OK, but the butter lettuce used was not fresh.  To receive this quality of food, I would rather just eat at the food court and it would be cheaper there too!  PS. Sorry no pics, phone died, but really...

It was basically, ""Oh shucks, let us remake that for you."" The waitress didn't apologize, the manager was having a goodbye-party in the back and we never heard from her. We paid for an entree that had to be remade (for SAFETY reasons) and came out 20 minutes after everyone else's food. Basically, we were served contaminated food and a $100 bill. The Cheesecake Factory, this was not an acceptable response to something so serious. When we have to visit a doctor after eating at your restaurant, the very least you should do is apologize.

The sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about, but better than the burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=100
Judd S.,"San Antonio, TX",6,7,1,4.0,3/25/2016,"Brought my family here and the large variety of foods made it perfect for my family! The Orange Chicken is the best I have ever had, amazing! Kids dishes were good too. Older kids got the Salmon and it was very flavorful. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=100
Brian K.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2016,"2016. 11. 05 Saturday Around 8:30.         Food is great and awesome as always. I would definitely give 5stars to my server Emily who were really kind and professional. I feel even so sorry for Emily that i am giving 1star just because of a rude hostess Jamila (i am not even sure if i spelled it right) who can never say sorry to customers that were pretty irritated by her attitude. it was my party's turn to be seated after 20 minutes waiting. We approached to the hostess and she told my girl friend to step aside so she can talk to a lady behind of us. If was our turn and the ones who were behind were seated first. We also got seated right after but i was quite upset about the behavior and headed back to the hostess station. All she said was that ""oh we dont do it that way. I told you to step aside so you could be seated."" Now what. I explained how we were irritated and she would never say sorry. I did not want to argue and told her that it was all our fault to get upset because you did not do anything wrong. Guess what she said. ""Oh yes we dont do it that way."" And i got sick of talking to someone who does not understand human language. Good day good weather good food and good server, but Jamila the hostess totally ruined our weekend dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=100
Mary U.,"Austin, TX",7,41,,5.0,3/14/2016,Ate here not long ago with a hefty friend. The chairs are strange tend to make you feel like you're leaning back but not comfortable for a fat butt. Which you would think at a place called Cheescake Factory the furniture would lean toward the heavy side but it was more like outdoor furniture. Okay enough about furniture. Once you are seated have fun reading the menu which way too many pages of food. We split an order of avacado egg rolls which by the way were delicious. Then we made the mistake of ordering an entree. I had a carbonara plate. Huge portions it was yummy but after three bites I knew it would go home to make another meal. I had to have a slice of tres leche cheesecake. It was heavenly. My companion had lemon meringue cheesecake that was out of this world. All in all we both dropped $30 a piece which is pricey but it fed me twice. Very good overall good service and a desire for more cheesecake in my future. Next time though just appetizer coffee and cheesecake,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=100
Nada C.,"78704 (South Austin), Austin, TX",2,4,1,5.0,10/24/2015,Bobby at the bar is awesome! We were over charged and he took time out (even though the bar was packed) to go talk his manager and fix the charges. Definitely will come back to see him!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin-2?start=100
