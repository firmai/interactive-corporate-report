Nicofer J.,"Chicago, IL",300,9,3,5.0,8/11/2017,My family and I stop at this cpk about twice a week. The rewards system they have is awesome and always pulls us in for more! The food is always great. Here we have the Thai crunch and spicy Kung pao pasta. Our family favorites for years! Try it out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Paula C.,"Chicago, IL",62,5,6,1.0,8/11/2017,"So so dissapointed ... this place is so NOT kids (family) friendly!!! Me and my daughter which is 14 mo (she was in a light umbrella stroller) and my friend, her son which is 6 years old and her 1 mo newborn daughter (which was in an infant car seat) wanted to have dinner here at 5pm today (Friday). The place was almost empty (2 occupied tables inside and maybe 2 outside on the patio). The girl at the entrance tried to tell us in different ways that we are not welcome to dine here. First she said that we could only be out on the patio which is exactly what we wanted, than she said that they can only sit 4 persons at a table.    We did not get it ... we were 2 adults, 2 kids and one newborn ... I guess because of the 5th person which is 1mo old in an infant car seat made it impossible for us. Than she said we could not get in with the strollers bla bla bla. She called the manager which started with the same story, so we lost it and just turned around and leave saying that we didn't know that families with kids are not welcome. Will never go back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Jennifer P.,"Chicago, IL",204,277,466,3.0,5/21/2017,"With mixed feelings all around, I finally got the chance to dine in at California Pizza Kitchen. The reps that come to my work would bring us this amazing chopped salad and sandwiches. That generosity has since fallen off, but what I had got me curious to sample more of the menu. On this visit I had the pesto cream penne with shrimp.   Overall the service was courteous and my food was just okay. I wanted more shrimp and the pesto sauce itself fell flat. I think it needed more salt or olive oil. Maybe they shouldn't do whatever they do in order to call the dish ""creamy."" Do I want to know what they use to make it creamy. I don't know.  All I know is that I love their salads and sandwiches. If I worked closer to this restaurant, I'd probably become a regular. I've noticed that this location gets packed in the afternoon. I did get some leers from the wait staff for choosing to linger in my large booth after finishing my average pasta dish. I had some time to kill between running errands and before my shift at work. Needless to say, when I got up to finally leave, the entire staff at the front entrance was staring at me like they had been staring for awhile. It was amusing. They all seemed to smile at the same time, saying their good byes, secretly wishing they could have followed that up with, ""Don't let the door hit you in the caboose!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Nabat N.,"Chicago, IL",25,61,181,4.0,5/16/2017,"Came here a couple of times. What does that mean? It means I liked it, duh! Is there anything better than pizza??? I don't think so! This isn't your regular pizza chain. Best thing is you have many different options to choose from!  I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza because after you have one slice you can't eat anymore. Thin crust is best so you can savor every bite.  They've got BBQ chicken pizza, Thai chicken pizza, Hawaiin pizza, Spicy Chipotle and many more fun pizzas to try. I just wish they can give me a slice of each pizza they have to offer. Just so I'll know which one I'd fall in love with the most.  And they're all baked in a brick oven with blazing fire before your very eyes.  I really liked the sauce they use for the wild mushroom strozzapreti, very flavorful.  The bread they serve beforehand with the olive oil is nicely baked! Yum!  I've also tried their super spinach and quinoa salad, very different, love it! And their salted caramel pudding for dessert which definitely amazed me ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Connie C.,"Skokie, IL",4,25,32,4.0,4/16/2017,"I came here on Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend. The weather was really nice outside so the outdoor seating was full, but indoor seating was readily available. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive; she came to check up on us often to make sure the food was good and our water glasses were filled.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. Then we got the wild mushroom strozzapreti and wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Compared to other places we've been to, I wouldn't say the spinach artichoke dip was anything special. The pasta and pizza were delicious though, and I definitely recommend those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Alison Y.,"Evanston, IL",169,254,915,4.0,5/30/2017,I haven't been to California Pizza Kitchen in years but I remember I used to love coming here with my mom for their pastas! I came with a coworker for lunch one afternoon and the food was pretty delicious! I'd equate it to the same quality as the Cheesecake Factory next door but a more limited menu. Price point seems about the same to me (perhaps a dollar or two cheaper).  Their complimentary bread and herb olive oil was so good - better than the bread and butter offering at most other restaurants! I ordered the tequila chicken pasta (tastyyyy!) and got their corn advocado guac app ($5 for a small portion). The app was unique but not something I'd order again - I'm glad that it was a small serving compared to other apps that seem to tip more towards the $10 mark these days. My pasta was made well and was a very healthy serving for the price. I left completely satisfied and was very happy with the service and quality of food! My coworker got the 1/2 salad which was a very generous serving as well! Definitely will be coming back for more!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Elaine M.,"Highland Park, IL",76,696,321,3.0,2/9/2017,"I was meeting a friend for lunch and she always wants to come here.  She has suggested it often.  In the past I have always steered clear.  I am not a fan.  I don't particularly like eating at chains and I had tried the pizza in the past and did not care for it at all.  I didn't have pizza this time so I can't comment on this location in particular.  Anyway I digress, we just couldn't agree on a place so since she always suggests CPK I acquiesced.   I really don't have too much good to say or bad either.  It was a perfectly average meal.  I guess I prefer to spend my money on something less average.  I had the soup and salad combination for lunch.  I chose the Sedona tortilla soup and a ceasar salad.  The soup was thick.  Like a chowder.  Not what I was expecting from the description.  It was piping hot though.  The salad was very plain, romaine lettuce a couple of shavings of parmesean and some croutons with the tiniest dish of dressing on the side.  There was barley enough dressing to dress a quarter of the salad.  All was eatable though. All in all it wasn't as bad as I had feared but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Mousa K.,"Dearborn, MI",9,69,82,3.0,4/1/2017,"Not the best location to dine into. Waiter and host were. very friendly upon arrival. Host dropped a knife under my feet, but it was no problem since we all make mistakes. I had a three course meal, with veggie pizza rolls, grilled shrimp Caesar salad and tortilla soup. Pizza rolls were delicious, especially that tomato sauce that came on the side. Grilled shrimp Caesar salad, was okay the parmesan was a little bit too strong, and the dressing was very water down ( i do not recommend) tortilla soup was not the hot, but still really good. Service was great though our waitress Gabby was tv advertisement friendly, meaning she was very nice girl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Regina C.,"Chicago, IL",0,25,4,3.0,10/30/2017,"The Roasted Garlis Chicken Pizza was back and we were excited but it was short lived as the taste was not of olden times glory and mine had maybe 5 small pieces of chicken on the entire pizza. I asked for some more chicken which they gladly brought but it was pretty bland overall with little flavor and I found 1 piece of roasted garlic. Service was pretty good and I must say the artichoke dip was really awesome but the tortilla spring rolls were way overpriced for the amount, for love of God one roll with a 1/2 small scoop of quacamole was  $4,30 NOOOOO.  Also nothing to do with CPK because I think the manager tried to ameliorate the problem which was a screaming child whose parents appeared to make NO attempt to stop the horrible noise. I do not appreciate going out to dinner and having my ears assailed by the eardrum splitting screams of uncontrolled children. We used to take our gilrs out a lot and when they even once started making noise either my husband or I would scoop them up and take them outside or to the car if necessary and I can tell you it only took a few times of this before they never ever repeated the behaviour. People with children need to get this and GET the heck out so as not to torture others with their poorly socialized chidren",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie
Rob W.,"Oak Park, IL",194,819,11,4.0,9/6/2016,"Went here awhile back and ordered what used to be one of my standard orders when I used to frequent the Deer Park location - the Jambalaya. Typically comes with spaghetti noodles - I always change it to penne pasta for ease of eating - also request no tails on the shrimp. They got it right - the dish was its flavorful self.  They've taken a different approach and keep the place kinda dark in teh daytime - doesn't impact the food, but personally, I liked the brighter look better - just a cleaner, ""less to hide"" appearance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie

Casey C.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,,2.0,9/14/2017,"I was always a huge fan of this place, mostly because I absolutely loved the pear and Gorgonzola pizza that came with a salad on top. Also, their bread was delicious! It was such a treat to do curbside carry out. Recently they removed the pizza I loved from the menu, and stopped providing the bread. I'm guessing the bread was a cost saving measure? They raised the pizza prices and took away bread. I've been back twice and tried 2 different pizzas, both were very mediocre. The only redeeming thing is they have some really great ranch dressing, but it's not enough to come back for.

Danny I.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,1.0,4/2/2017,"On a bright sunny day, a friend and I decided to stop by at California pizza for a delicious meal; after all, my deceased grandmother absolutely loved this place. As we walked into the restaurant, we were treated by a nice hostess. She told us we had to wait 20 minutes just so we could have our table. I looked around the restaurant and saw that there were empty tables at every corner. Though, I didn't mind waiting. I proceeded to ask the lady about the bottles on the wall behind her which caught my eye. She laughed in my face and told me that they're actually fake to make the restaurant look more expensive, otherwise they wouldn't be able to charge $16 for a Sicilian. After that I sat down in the waiting room and was pleasantly greeted by a few of thousands of screeching children running around here like its Chuckie cheese on a Saturday afternoon. They began their demonic chanting which took part of my soul it wasn't till I was nearly passed out from this that I was able to gather the strength of a thousand Rubens and kick these satan children away from me. Once we finally got our table, we waited another 20 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. He started us off with two cups of toilet bowl water mixed with tap water to even our the acidity. We were then treated to a nice plate of bread and oil which looks like it came out of my car's engine after ten thousand miles. I couldn't help but notice the low hanging lights with the dimmest lighting I've ever seen in my life.  If the lights were fluorescent they would not have to be dangling it is a true shame.

But, nevertheless, I have yet to have a bad meal. So far so good... knock on wood.  I love their veggie salad. It's kind of like a garbage salad, except there is nothing bad about it... it's good for you garbage! Eggplant, mushrooms, lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, red and yellow peppers and asparagus. Add the California veggie pizza, a bowl of split pea soup, and you've got the ultimate tasty lunch. My kiddos each had a personal pan pizza, which comes with a drink.

I got a half Moroccan Spiced Chicken salad that included roasted butter nut squash, dates, avocado, toasted almonds, beets, red pepper, chopped egg and cranberries.  Yum!  Everyone else got the half original chicken barbeque salad.  I enjoyed my salad and loved the taste of the cranberries, but it needed a little more kick, maybe in the dressing, which was champagne vinaigrette.   Service showed the results of good corporate training and along with consistently good food explains why the place was packed at lunch.

They got the classic pizzas, new options for entrees. We then started with the Baja and Mediterranean spring rolls. These were nothing special, pretty much tortillas wrapped some ingredients, deff not worth it. Finally we ended with kung pao spaghetti and a tostada pizza. The noodles weren't bad, not as spicy as i would like, really rich and filling. The toastada pizza is a classic. Along with the bbq pizza one of my favorite items. Although the pizza is not the same as it used to be. First off, its a thin crust pizza now, I swear the crust was thicker before. Also somethings a little off, its not as good as it used to be.

Stephen M.,"Lake Forest, IL",41,325,84,3.0,1/17/2014,"No grade inflation--this reliable pizza place is 3 1/2 stars, but I can't round up. I am a fan of their whole menu--I'd recommend getting a pizza and appetizer to split for 2 people.  The pizzas are individual, but on the large size for that. They're working hard to please their clientele--the current menu has additions and subtractions from the past but you can see the effort at different crusts (very thin, thin and medium) and creative combinations.  I favor the Thai chicken, but I'd say there will be something you can find which pleases your taste ideas.

Judy E.,"Chicago, IL",0,20,3,2.0,6/6/2015,"Visiting a friend who just moved across the street from Old Orchard, she suggested I bring California Pizza Kitchen Thai Chicken pizza. We had been big fans years ago when CPK opened on Orleans St. in Chicago, often going several times a month. I hadn't had anything but the frozen, grocery store CPK pizza for many, many years so I was excited to have the real thing again. Entering the restaurant I immediately noticed the visible grease and dirt covering the menus at the hostess stand, but I ignored it and stepped inside to a dark restaurant whose only lights were from the take-out sign and the kitchen. It was gorgeous and sunny outside, but there was no sunlight filtering through the windows, and it gave a sense of dinginess rather than the typical darker ambiance of a restaurant. I knew what I wanted and was grateful I didn't have to touch the menu laid out on the take-out counter, and the staff was fast, friendly, and efficient and I had my order to go in less than 10 minutes.    Another 10 minutes and I was sitting down to eat in my friend's kitchen, disappointed to see that the julienne veggies were just piled on top, not cooked into the pizza. And when I picked up a slice they fell off - not a few, nearly all of them. Perhaps it is unfair to compare today's pizza with its predecessor, but I was very disappointed. From the loose raw veggies that never touched the peanut sauce to the crust that tasted like the freezer version, there was nothing there to make a happy memory.

The food is absolutely delicious, always has been and always will be. There is such a wide variety of options to choose from that there's something for everyone and more than one pizza for everyone. I generally go with one of: Thai Chicken Pizza, BBQ Chicken Pizza, Chipotle Chicken Pizza or Carnitas Habanero Pizza. They're all fantastic with a lot of unique flavors. The atmosphere at this CPK is great, they used to be up on the second floor of the building next to their current one and that area with the massive mirrors and tall ceilings just felt rather stale so I was excited to see the new place which is very homey although maybe a bit dimly lit. The staff has always been attentive and responsive including honoring a few expired coupons. The only downside to CPK is the price, meals can get a bit expensive (solid $$, definitely not $$$). But I think of it this way, I get my pizza for roughly $14 (+tax/tip) but that gets me two meals so I'm paying only $7+change for two meals which is easily justifiable. Highly recommend CPK, enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=40

Kristine R.,"Chicago, IL",501,86,74,5.0,12/6/2014,"I came here for my birthday on a Saturday night and the wait time was ridiculously long! I actually was looking forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner but I think it was prom night or something because there were a million teenagers in prom dresses waiting for tables there.. So my brother suggested California Pizza Kitchen. I think we waited about an hour and a half for a table for 12. I don't blame them though, we didn't have reservations, and we had a pretty big party. This was my first time at this restaurant and was surprised that they had a lot to offer on their menu. I ended up ordering everything on the appetizer list and loved it all! My favorite ones were the chips and spinach artichoke dip and the avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg rolls were the best I've ever had! I am a huge fan of chicken alfredo, I get it every time I go to any italian restaurant, so that's what I ordered here. They call it the Garlic Cream Fettuccine.  I ordered extra broccoli and portabello mushrooms with it. So, I was blown away when I tasted this dish! I almost never finish my meals at restaurants because I eat so much appetizers but I cleaned this plate off fast! This by far was the best Alfredo I've ever had in my life. Thinking about it makes me want to order it right now. My husband got the Hawaiian Pizza. Everyone else seemed pretty happy with everything they ordered. I can't say too much about how the pizza tasted because I didn't have any but my husband loved it. By the end of the night, they brought me out a huge ice cream sundae for my birthday with a candle. That sundae didn't have a chance. I inhaled it so fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=40
Meredith N.,"Midtown, Saint Louis, MO",0,2,4,4.0,5/15/2015,"I frequent this CPK (enough to realize that they redecorated the interior - the new booth upholstery is pretty snazzy.) My friends and I have a set routine when we visit any CPK, which is centered around us trying to decide between our individual go-to dishes.  I was all set for the big debate: chicken lettuce wraps or avocado chicken club egg rolls? Carnitas tacos? California club sandwich or the grilled chicken Caesar sandwich with the Sedona tortilla soup? Well, along with the interior, it seems the menu was also revamped. Three of my 5 favorite things to order are no longer options. The sandwiches can only be ordered from 11-4 during the ""lunch"" hours and even then, you only have the option of ordering a half sandwich. This is a farce. It made my ordering process a heck of a lot easier but I already went through the coping period of when CPK switched the kind of bread they used for their sandwiches and now I have to deal with having to make sure I arrive at a specific time and can only order half of what I'm crazily craving!?  Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and I'm not about to deprive myself from the glory of dining at CPK, I just wish I could keep my options open (also they raised small plate prices..

My coworkers and I devoured that. Someone else ordered the chocolate cake which was too ""chocolate-y"" for me. A few of us also ordered drinks (martinis and mojitos), but it seems like they mixed the cups up because after getting second drinks, my coworker noticed that his drink tasted eerily similar to another.

Michael S.,"Plainfield, IL",27,16,9,2.0,7/9/2013,"Meh. We've been to several CPK's throughout the area. This one ranks low. I don't know what it is about a lot of restaurants these days, but when the waiter/waitress finds out you're coming in for dessert, or a meal that isn't going to mean a huge, gigantic tip, they give up...and don't care. That's what happened to us. We were here on a Monday afternoon. It was busy, yes, but there were plenty of wait staff around. We weren't in the mood for pizza, as there are other menu items here that are also typically terrific. But as soon as our waiter found out we weren't ordering alcohol, and then when we placed our order for an appetizer to share and a large salad, a ""...hhmmmmph"" attitude ensued. Great way to keep happy customers coming back! (/sarcasm) Firstly, the sesame chicken dumplings are a rip off. It's like $7.99, and they give you...6? Maybe? So $8 bucks for so little food? Ugh.  The ""Italian Chopped Salad"" or whatever it's been changed to in the last year or so is also a huge disappointment. They added garbanzo beans (which they remembered to hold after we asked this time), made the portion smaller, and cut WAY BACK on the normally-awesome mustard/parmesan viniagarette. This is the 2nd or 3rd time now we've ordered this salad & could barely taste the dressing.  So lesson learned: don't go to CPK unless you plan on ordering food that's going to mean a large tip for the waiter/waitress. Possibly pass on some of the appetizers unless you're the type with money to burn; and if you're going to order their formerly-stellar chopped salad with that viniagarette to die for, ask for extra dressing on the side. Maybe it was just a bad day for our waiter; I dunno. It was a Monday, not a holiday, and the place was buzzing but not stressed.

Why it took 30 minutes to tell us, I do not know. We reordered. Waited another 30 minutes. Food came out. Food was cold. Food was sent back. Food was brought out again, reheated and sad. No silverware. Waited for silverware. Brought plates for sharing. The middle plate was cracked in half and broke on the table. It was one stupid thing after another. The thing that was annoying was that the manager knew, and made no attempt to smooth it over-- no comping something on the bill, no free dessert or whatever. I've been a waitress-- I know what's supposed to happen when a meal gets totally messed up and the customers are annoyed. The manager is supposed to apologize, and offer some gesture of making it right. Nothing. It was poor service.

About the food...  I have some favorites, and I generally stick to them: 1.  Sedona tortilla soup.  Not a traditional tortilla soup by any stretch of the imagination, but delicious.  It is thick and hearty, and also vegetarian for you meat-o-phobes. 2. Chicken tinga quesadillas.  These are on the small plates menu, and paired with a cup of said soup, create the perfect lunch.  The flavors go well together, and the quesadillas are perfectly spicy. 3. Pear/Gorgonzola pizza.  For the adventurers.  People look at me funny when I eat this in the office, until I let them taste a bite.  It is the perfect combo of sweet and savory. 4. BLT or California Club pizza, for when you're craving bacon on your pizza, and really, who wouldn't? 5. Thai Crunch salad.  Crunchy.  peanut-y.  I sub avocado for chicken. and, what I ordered today... which I think will be giving the Thai Crunch the boot... Caramelized Peach salad.  This is so delicious.  I'm eating it as I write.  The peaches are sweet, and the gorgonzola is savory.  The red onions are sliced very thin, giving it just the right amount of bite.  The almonds add crunch.   A word of caution to those ordering take-out, go with the cup v. bowl of soup, and the 1/2 v. whole salad.  It seems in my experience that the sizes are actually pretty much the same, and you are just paying more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=60

Karen M.,"Evanston, IL",0,18,,2.0,4/26/2015,"I keep giving my local CPK (at Old Orchard) a chance. I'm not sure why...  1. We almost left before ordering last night -- it was SOOOO noisy, with loud music blasting from the speaker above our heads. They blamed the kids but that wasn't the main problem. (I don't mind active kids, and having a restaurant blame the customers is not a good thing to do.) We were moved to another area of the restaurant. They eventually turned the volume down a bit (not enough but a bit), and the type of music changed and was MUCH better. In the first seating area the waiter couldn't even hear us and we couldn't hear him.  2. Even though the patio was not open (we ate inside), they have new furniture -- that is a GREAT improvement. The chairs they've had the past 2-3 years have been incredibly uncomfortable. The patio is one of the--perhaps the only--good part of this CPK. It is covered and so one can eat then in rainy weather. 3. I've been going to CPK since they opened in California -- they were great then. They have sold out. They now have another new menu, with a reduced selection of pizza, and many more that sounds like very traditional pizzas. Their whole ""reason to be"" seems gone. They haven't had the Tandoori Chicken Pizza for years -- it was my favorite. The Thai Chicken Pizza -- my other favorite -- now is rather tasteless and has almost no chicken. The peanut sauce is so sparce I could hardly taste it last night. And, there are too many bean sprouts and shredded carrots--both good to have, but not as the major part of the pizza. The original intention of CPK was to blend influences from different parts of the world. They seem to now be a sausage, pepperoni pizza place. I don't need to go there to spend double or triple for what I can get elsewhere. I'm disappointed in the ""new"" CPK menu choices. (I do like the Moroccan salad, which I got last week from another CPK--it now has more lettuce than in the past which I don't appreciate--the seem to give more cheap ingredients and less of the real substance of their dishes.

I took it home and heated it up the next day, thinking it was a temperature issue. It was still sorta ""blah."" I would consider giving them another chance since I like the mall and the area.

I was contacted by the manager, Trista, who wanted to apologize for the terrible experience and wanted me to give them another try. I was offered a gift certificate so I can go visit them again and hopefully everything will be fine this time. Unfortunately, I would like to share that the management and the staff are at the same level. It has been more than 2 months and I have not received anything promised from them. They continued bothering me by sending me emails asking them to explain the situation. I have done that here and I don't want to continue repeating myself. If you really cared, you were going to read the reviews here and try to fix the situation. Trista asked me twice what is my contact information so she can send me a certificate. I provided her with this information and now 2 months later I have not received anything. Even if you have send it using a dove, I was going to receive it by now.Thank you very much, now for sure I am not coming back. You are extremely disrespectful to your customers.

Terrence C.,"Chicago, IL",86,113,,4.0,5/10/2010,"I try not to review chains too much, but I think CPK is a pretty decent spot. The most ironic thing about my admiration for CPK, is that I don't even think the pizza is the best thing on the menu.  The prices are fairly moderate, and portions are plenty. The atmosphere is fun. The place is nice enough to go on a casual date, but laid back to the point where you can wear gym shoes and just chill. My server was a bit slow considering the place was not too busy (saturday night at 10pm) but  he was very nice and polite. With all that said. LET'S EAT! So, like I mentioned earlier, the pizzas are ok. Nothing too special to me. The margarita pizza is nice and light, and I think I've tried a thai chicken one before too which was not too bad. Is this how they do pizza in California? Cause in Chicago, we demand a bit more. There are some other hidden gems on the menu that I would like to point out... Chopped BBQ chicken salad is pretty freakin good. Its an awesome blend of a lot of good things. Lime, chicken, bbq sauce, black beans, light salad dressing. Its good! Chicken tequila pasta is really good too. Its a different taste than what I would expect. Hard to describe. Just try it.  My last visit I tried the fish tacos. This dish had a lot of potenial, but they killed it with the red cabbage or whatever the veggies they added. Maybe order this w/o the cabbage and you'll love it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=80

My very expensive $15 Cobb Salad (minus bacon, add ranch on the side)  was enormous!  Our waitress, Frannie, was adorable, and attentive, and read my mind about needing more ranch dressing!  I love it when my salad is all chopped up into little bits and I don't have to use my knife at all to cut anything.  Bonus star for the outdoor seating, on a beautiful, sunny day, in The Skokie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=80

Syretta H.,"Waukegan, IL",36,191,,2.0,10/12/2009,"Went here with my friend after church one Sunday when she discovered that I had never been...it's was a Sunday that the Bears played so we thought it would be pretty quiet. In fact, it turned out to be quite the opposite- it was packed....  Anywho, we ordered some of the Spinach Dip and when it came out it was barely warm, so we had to send it back. Our server was great, until about a day after we left the restaurant, but I'll get back to that...so when we got our reheated dip, we decided it was mediocre at best. I ordered the white pizza, which I though was pretty good. I think my friend had the shrimp scampi pizza, which she also enjoyed. We had seen someone else order this dessert that we wanted, so we checked the dessert menu, and it was the chocolate souffle cake- which was fine, until we saw that the little piece of cake was almost $6.00 by itself, and if you wanted a scoop of Haagen Daz, that was almost an extra $3!!! We ordered it anyway, and I have to say it was good (although no one can beat Wildfire Chocolate cake YET.....)  Overall we were satisfied with the food and the service. Now here's the kicker...so I had cash and my friend didn't. We split the bill down the middle. There was $26 in cash in the leather bill holder thingy that they bring to the table. My friend put her debit card in there and said to one said server ""There is cash in there, please put the remaining balance on the card"".....waitress comes back WAY TOO FAST...and we both said to her, wow you are quick! We were so busy yapping and laughing that it was not until the next day that my friend noticed that our waitress put the entire balance on the debit card and got a $26 tip...and then some, cause we had left the tip on the table....really waitress? You really thought that $26 was your tip???!!!!! My friends fault for not checking the receipt before she signed.....

Generally, the staff here is always slow and not very responsive until its time to pay. Glasses are always left empty and I can never seem to waive down my server, instead its always someone else's.

It was a Monday night so the place wasn't terribly busy, nor was it empty.  We were quickly seated and the waiter arrived within moments to take our drink order.  His service to us was very attentive but not overdone.  He knew all the right times to check in on us.   I had the BBQ Chicken salad.  I thought it was very tasty and I liked having the option to add fresh avocado.  I must admit I found myself eating the bbq chicken on top and the salad below separately.  I was a bit afraid to mix it all together.  However, the tastes complimented each other in individual bites.  Once I got to the bottom, I felt that the salad had a bit too much ranch but otherwise, 75% of the salad was mixed perfectly.  The half salad is PLENTY for an entree.  Despite my attempt, I was unable to finish.  I cannot imagine a full order!

When we walked in the front door I was expecting something different than what I found. It was set up kind of like an applebee's or TGIFridays or any of those chain restaurants, which makes sense due to the fact that it is a chain. It had a bit more of a jazzy feel to it than I was expecting though. The waitress was sweet but only offered things I would never eat, but I'm a picky eater admittedly. We ended up with the pesto chicken and the white pizza with bacon. We had an appetizer that was basically bruschetta mix in a bowl with cheese garlic bread on the side. The appetizer was easily my favorite thing of the night. The pizza wasn't bad but not amazing either. The dessert we ended up with was an apple crumble that needed a little more work. The taste was there but with the peels still on the slices of apples it made it tricky at times to get a piece out without making a huge mess. The crumble on top was easily the best part of the dessert since the apples were tricky to get out of the dish.
