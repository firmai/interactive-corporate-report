27,Matt S.,"Saint Louis, MO",27,97,8.0,1.0,2012-06-20,"I have been debating all morning whether to even review this, because it would involve admitting I actually ate at a Chili's. Why Matthew? Why would you put yourself through this? Borderline masochism. First off I broke one of my rules - there is no reason to ever go East of the river, North of Delmar, West of McKnight or South of Loughborough (some exceptions apply, but not many). I had to swing by Hobby Lobby to frame some World Series pictures and surprise my 8 year old baseball fanatic and was in no-man's land in Kirkwood on 44 and Lindbergh, starving at 1:30pm. I swear to god, I pulled in the parking lot, changed my mind, pulled out of my spot and drove to the exit to leave before saying, ""the hell with it"" its just a quick lunch."" So i walked into this place and instantly wanted to run. I have grown into such a snob that i hate everything about a corporate restaurant. I hate the 17 year old hostess.....I hate the mid-40's chubby bartender who is the ""loud chick"" and definitely played softball at some point in her life......I hate the pothead busboy's.....I really hate the mid40's 5 ft 6in chain of a manager who is convinced he is running Le Cirque, even though he or someone close to him has a daily meth habit. After looking through the menu and praying I wont run into anyone I know, I decide on the chicken fajitas and a diet coke. Butch my bartender comes out 15 minutes later with 7-8 slices of flavorless chicken on a bed of overcooked onions and green peppers. I get this tiny, oompa loompa sized plate that had 7 strands of Cheddar cheese, mini scoops of guac and sour cream and 4-5 tiny bits of tomato. A bucket of sand off a beach in Texas has more flavor than this. It was gross, and all for the bargain lunch price of 16.53. If you have the chance to make it Chili's....don't. Cut your losses and head across the street to Chipolte or Arby's. Or just shoot yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood?start=20,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003

The waiter kept forgetting items the table requested. The food took over an hour to come out and when it did the cheese on my mashed potatoes was not melted which is a huge no,no for me. Also, you have to pay with this tablet that is on your table but didn't work while we were there so we had to wait for the already non existent waiter to come back and request he swipe the card.

I normally do not frequent chain restaurants because they are usually way too many kids there. And I prefer to support local endeavors. I sat in the bar area and a guy was on his phone talking loudly.  I asked the waitress about it and she got her manager who insisted they could not tell him to tone it down. They said he was having a business meeting with the guy at the table. I said he is on the phone, i see it on and he is looking away from the guy.  They offered to reseat me but i wasn't interested in sitting near any small hooligans. The food was actually better then i expected which isn't to say it was great. I got the sour cream enchiladas.  They do have happy hour pricing until 6pm.  So I got a decent sized well drink for $3.50. Service was fairly decent too. Parking isn't great there and it was a little loud.  I would only go back if someone insisted or i had a gift card. They did have a lot of nice tvs in the bar area.  So I think it might be a nice place to catch games if you are interested in that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood?start=20,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

The chicken was cut in half and fit on half of the bun. This is because (as I was JUST told by Eric"" the very nice General Manager) I asked for a different bun other than the pretzel bun. Makes sense.  I ate half my sandwich as of it was a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich. The sandwich was good but I was disappointed that the chicken was half. I honestly didn't taste the avocado because there was just one slice.  I am glad I discussed this with Eric. This changed my rating from 2 to 3.

19,Kitty W.,"Saint Louis, MO",175,269,2214.0,4.0,2014-09-26,"I can't say much about Chili's. I dine here infrequently, and as a consequence, I almost always get a different waiter and a new menu. Compared to other somewhat similar chain restaurants (e.g., Ruby Tuesday, Applebee's), Chili's is probably my favorite. I like Chili's Tex-Mex/Southwestern flair.  So, this will be one of my shorter reviews. I can't tell you much about the menu because they're always changing it. That is great if you like variety and bad if you aren't fond of change. They'll probably always have certain items (e.g., burgers). One thing I enjoy is the Bottomless Express Lunch, which they've had for as long as I can remember. You get chips, salsa, soup, and salad. I think you get refills on any of those things (at least, you used to), but if you are on your lunch break, you probably won't have time for that anyway.  My most recent meal at this location was from the Fresh Mex section. I ordered Southwest Pairings, where you choose two or three selections from a list of Mexican-inspired items. Your choices are served with rice and black beans. I went with a green chile chicken enchilada and a cup of chicken enchilada soup. It wasn't the best meal EVER, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I'd probably order something like that again, but with a few changes. The rice seemed a little oily to me, so I'd request to substitute black beans. Also, I wouldn't get the chicken enchilada soup. The broth part was kind of absolutely amazing, but the chicken was weird. It was rectangular and sort of spongy. (Don't get me wrong. I'm not under the impression that the Chili's crew is cooking chicken, shredding it by hand, and spending all day making soup. I envision them just opening a bag/can and heating up a cup for me. However, I've had better chicken in other soups at Chili's.) Last time I was there, they had a Coca-Cola Freestyle. I love those things. They offer more than 100 drink choices. You can get various flavors of some of your favorite drinks, including Fruit Punch Minute Maid, Grape Sprite, or Peach Dasani. Anyone want an Orange Coke? I don't, but I hear that's all the rage in Russia. I'm a Cherry or Cherry Vanilla Diet Dr. Pepper type of person. Anyway, I've never had particularly bad food or bad service at this Chili's. My rating is somewhere between 3 stars (A-OK) and 4 stars (Yay! I'm a fan.). I wouldn't say I'm Chili's biggest fan or anything like that, but I'm rounding up to 4 stars. It's pretty much what you would expect from a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,,,,,
21,Joe H.,"Chesterfield, MO",2,18,2.0,1.0,2015-06-08,I ordered some lunch to go on Friday. House salad with thousand Island and chicken strips. I guess they forgot to tell me when I ordered that they don't carry that dressing so whatever I put all over my salad was some spicy orange dressing that tasted terrible and the chicken strips were made in a tempura batter and so greasy I had to eat them with a fork and knife. I ate one and that was enough.  Called the manager and explained which she informed me they don't carry thousand isle so I am not sure what dressing you received and sorry about the greasy tempura chicken strips.  No can we make it up for you or anything.  Last time there...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood?start=20,,,,,

9,Chris Z.,"Avondale Estates, GA",70,1335,858.0,2.0,2015-12-07,"I've been to Chili's many times during air travel.  There is a location in many of the airports.  But I never really had the desire to choose the local location for dinner until a gift card provided the extra push.   The Kirkwood Chili's is located right in the middle of two flanking strip malls, which means it always seems busy.  We arrived at arround 2 PM on a Saturday and they were packed.  There were only a couple of open tables.  The placed is made for those with A.D.D.  There are flatscreens throughout the restauarnt and the bar area has so many that they seem to overlap.  There are tablets on stands at every table where you can look at pictures of their food, play games, and use it to pay your bill.   Once we sat two of the tables around us were already having problems.  So we were sure to check our order when it arrived.  My wife didn't get her avocado for her burger.  We pointed that out and they were quick to fix it.  But I definately would recommend checking your order right away.  Food was fine.  I had a quesadilla salad which was actually pretty good.  And all together our bill was ~$30 including tip.  Service was just ok.  The drinks weren't kept refilled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,,,,,

I am past the little kids stage of my life, I don't want screaming kids around me. Why then did the hostess just sit a young couple with 2 kids under 5 at the table next to me? It is very annoying, the kids both almost immediate started yelling about stuff.

3,Alison N.,"Affton, MO",197,166,1452.0,2.0,2016-02-14,"Chilis is really starting to slip. For one, their menu is too large with too many items. No restaurant can keep up with that many dishes and make them all taste good.  I was pretty disappointed in my last visit. Everything was bland and tasteless. It all looked like microwaved products. Nothing seemed to be made in house.  The wait staff was very unorganized and unsure. We ordered an appetizer but it arrived after our salads. Then the entrees came out very soon after that. Our table couldn't hold all the plates, as almost everything is served on its own plate. Just a very disappointing experience. Chilis needs a re-tooling and re-branding, cut your menu in half and make good, fresh food in house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,,,,,
25,April S.,"Baltimore, MD",20,52,4.0,1.0,2016-03-26,"Cilantro.  People either love it or hate it.  I absolutely DETEST the stuff with a burning passion. Cooks like to sprinkle it in the most RANDOM freaking places, so I've learned to ALWAYS ask whether or not something has cilantro before I order it.  There was some sort of Pick-Three-Items option on the menu and I decided on the cheese curds, fried pickles, and mini burgers for my three.  I honestly didn't think there would be cilantro in any of those dishes, but having learned from past experiences, I asked the server.  She thought about it for a second and then informed me there was no cilantro in my order.  Great. Sign me up.  I should mention that this particular server was probably the rudest I've gotten in a while.  Never once said thank you... just walked off without a word after we placed our order...clearly not a people person.  Hey, I get it, lady. I freaking hate people.  This is why I choose NOT to work with the public.  Maybe think about a career change.  But I digress.  The food arrives. The cheese curds are covered in cilantro. WHY??? WHY WOULD ANYONE SPRINKLE CILANTRO OVER CHEESE CURDS??!!!! This makes NO sense. I'm annoyed.  Rightfully so, I think.  I begin the laborious task of picking off the cilantro.  The server comes back to ask if our order is okay (she manages to do this in such a way that made it pretty clear that she didn't care either way) and I tell her there's cilantro in the cheese curds.  She says nothing and walks away. Wow.  A few minutes later, she returns to refill our drinks and I'm still picking at the food. She finally asks if I want another order.  Kind of rude about it...acted like this was my fault. No apologies. I was finished with Operation-Remove-Cilantro by that point and declined.  The fried pickles were TERRIBLE. A very thin coating of whatever the hell kind of breaded mess that was...just enough to create a thin soggy layer on top of the too thick pickle chips, and three watered down sauces. Just terrible.  My friend ordered the fajitas, which turned out to be about 65% onions and some type of terrible tasting meat.  Neither of us ate our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood?start=20,,,,,

This is the first time in my life that I've left a restaurant and written $0.00 for a tip. Yup, the service was that bad. The burgers were great but the interaction is with the FOH staff not the cooks.  We were a 2 top, seated in the bar at a booth. We waited for 5 - 10 minutes before Mary (the bartender) came by our table. It went down hill from there. Apparently we were inconveniencing her. Food was plopped on the table, she never came back and asked how we were enjoying our meal, and the smile she did put on seemed faked.  She definitely had time to tend and chat to the few (~4) folks sitting at the bar but coming out to a booth just cramped her style.

We all ordered steak and we all asked for well done, but when our steaks came out they were not well done at all. In fact mine was very bloody and so was my friends.. we couldn't eat it. The other 2 steaks were cooked well done with no blood. Our plates were covered in blood and it got all over our mashed potatoes and broccoli. We told our waitress and she was very nice and said she would have the cook make us new steaks and have the manager come over to talk to us. Well he did and he wasn't concerned about our happiness, he talked to us like we were kind of stupid and he just came off rude and not friendly at all and didn't seem to care about us as customers but we told him that our waitress was very nice and doing her job well. He was just like umm ok, kind of weird.. for a manager to be acting nonchalant about it but ok. Then he said the steaks will be out soon but it shouldn't take very long and we said ok thank you. It was late at night maybe around 9 something so there wasn't anyone really in there.. the steaks came out pretty quickly and they were cooked well done this time and everything else tasted delicious. Then the next thing we know our waitress is bringing out us deserts and we were shocked and confused.. she said here's some deserts and she said thank you for being so nice about the steaks and we said yea why not, she claimed that she had been yelled at and embarrassed before from other customers so I guess the manager doesn't seem to care to make paying customers happy and then they want to take it out on the severs. There's no way it could have been her fault and we told her that but she kept saying sorry but it wasn't her fault at all, it's the cooks fault for not cooking the steaks long enough. I don't know what's going on with management or what but Chili's in Kirkwood needs to step there game up! The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the manager being so rude to us. We didn't ask for a discount nor did we receive one but he should have made sure we was happy as customers, but no our waitress made sure we was happy! I will be back to Chili's and I hope I get better service from the manager if need be but I also hope I get the same waitress and she got a good tip because she really deserved it!

I had to wait for 25 minutes and I placed my order 15 minutes before that so I am waiting 45 minutes now and I can see my food sitting in front but non of the waitress or manager have the courtesy to just give me my order instead they are asking among them self who took my order so that person can check me out... the manager had no interest even after I complain he just stood there when I said this is the last time I am coming he was like OK.. never ever going back ...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006
7,Gabriella K.,"Saint Louis, MO",39,1,,1.0,2017-06-15,This was literally the worst dining experience that i have ever had at any resturaunt. It took over 2 hrs for a simple lunch. Ive been a server  for the last 12 years and im completely understanding of getting in the weeds or being new. However the unapologetic and rude behavior of Tejae amazed me beyond belief. I could not tell you the last time i didnt tip at least 20% and honestly felt awful that i didn't  but what we left her was more then deserved.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
0,Fiona D.,"Chicago, IL",202,1,3.0,4.0,2017-07-27,"Had a great experience at chilis on 7/27. Mandy was our server. I waited for about 10-15 minutes before she took our order, but I noticed she had a large party to attend to, so I was understanding. We ordered the 2 for $22. The Texas cheese fries were a good appetizer. Nothing to write home about, but they weren't bad. I added on a queso as an appetizer and let me tell you - their queso is incredible. It was served warm and the chips to go along with were warm and had just the right amount of crisp. I ordered the chicken fajitas, and I thought they were very good. It was a huge portion and I had plenty leftover to bring home. Loved the ambiance inside as well. Overall I thought the service was good and the food was great as well. Will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
1,Peter D.,"Brentwood, CA",0,8,,2.0,2017-08-17,"Came in here at 5pm on a Thursday with my family. Restaurant was clean, waitress was attentive but the food was lacking. Tortilla chips were stale and all of our fries were lukewarm and stale as though they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours. There was something off with my wife's chicken strippers; the chicken texture was rubbery and unnatural.  Would like to have chalked this up to a one off occurrence, but has the same experience a month ago when we were here. Just not the same place that it used to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
2,M L.,"St. Louis, MO",0,14,,3.0,2018-01-12,C. This very average franchise restaurant has very average food for a very average price. There is nothing remarkable about this place when compared to the 1/2 dozen or so similarly average franchise restaurants nearby.  It was clean.  The wait staff were decent.  Wear beige.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kirkwood,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
