48,Mallory S.,"Burleson, TX",7,15,,3.0,2014-09-19,I went by Friday's a week or so ago. My waitress came to my table and asked what we wanted a Dr. Pepper or Margarita? Neither.  My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a water. She asked if I was sure I didn't want a beer too. I said yes. She asked what appetizers we would be ordering. We ordered one. She asked if we wanted to try the endless appetizer special they have going on right now? We said no. (that would have been $10/a person). She came back to our table and asked if we would be having the Jack Daniel's steaks. No. We ordered what we wanted. When we were about 1/2 done with our food she returned and asked if we would be eating the brownie or oreo dessert. No.  I understand upselling will increase her tip but OMG go away. 1 attempt per table is plenty. Before I was done with my meal I was annoyed with her. She might as well have simply asked us to give her money. That is what it felt like. We felt very uncomfortable. The food was good but we probably won't return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=40,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

The food did not take long to come out and it was wonderful.  The pot stickers were great and we actually ended up getting six orders! The waitress was very nice and polite.  The only odd point during the meal was when the Manager brought our last order of pot stickers and told us that once he had a guy eat 25 pot stickers and then run to the bathroom to vomit.  Who says something like that to customers?  I don't know if he was serious and just didn't realize how gross and inappropriate that was or if he was trying to get us to stop ordering food.  Either way I'm knocking the review down one cause of him. I'd go back and tell the guy to hush it the second he approached my table.  I'm hip to his game now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

My assumption was that it would be as good as any other chain restaurant and my overall experience was satisfactory.  We were seated immediately and our waitress came to take our drink order fairly quickly. The strawberry passion tea was delicious. Pot stickers were ordered and they were fried perfectly-- They tasted better than my expectations. We ordered the 6 ounce petite sirloin steak, the classic cheeseburger, and the California club sandwich. The sandwich and burger were both good. The steak, however, was a little dry. I requested medium-rare and the steak arrived nearly medium-well and it had lost all its moisture due to sitting on the grill for too long. The taste itself was fine but I wouldn't order it again. Our waitress Tiffani was nice and although she seemed inexperienced because she couldn't answer our questions right away, she returned to our table with answers in a timely fashion.  Overall a fine experience from a mediocre chain restaurant but it's what I had expected.

Decided to give it another try and could not be more happy that I did. We started with the pretzels and queso and my tastebuds did a happy dance with every bite. They were lightly crisp on the outside and hot and fluffy inside - the queso dip came loaded with bacon and tomatoes and was a perfect accompaniment. I could've stopped there, but ordered the sizzling cheesy chicken skillet. Equally yummy. The sweet potatoes that came with it were maybe the best I've ever had. Seriously. The hub ordered the wingman buffalo burger. If you like buffalo wings, you will love this burger! Nicely seasoned and slightly spicy and very juicy. Everything we ordered was fresh, piping hot and perfectly cooked. Kudos to the kitchen staff!!  The staff was amazing as well. Our waitress was very friendly, and got our food out to us quick enough that the food burned my tongue. Perfect!! Shout out to the GM Robin for making sure our dining experience was everything it should be. Overall just a perfect experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

The food was also very fast. We got the fried mozzarella. It was very good, not greasy at all. My husband enjoyed his burger. I ordered the pot stickers as my meal.

We tried the potstickers, wings, potato skins and mozzarella sticks. The margaritas are the best I have ever had. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is because the wait was super long and they sat another couple down before us who actually came in awhile after us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
32,Christa C.,"Killeen, TX",0,1,,5.0,2017-05-24,"Went to Fridays on Saturday around 7. It wasn't crazy busy so it was convenient that we didn't have to wait to be seated.  Our server, Trisha, was the sweetest and made sure my 2 children (under 4) received their food before me and my husband. Plus she made sure to ask if the food was the right temperature for them. (it was perfect)  I got the Million Dollar Cobb Salad and my husband got the Endless Appetizers. She was knowledgeable and helpful with the menu and our drinks were always full.  Seriously... I've been a server before and was very impressed with how attentive she was, even with a full section.  The manager was also very nice and professional. (I believe her name was Lauren) She approached our table and made sure everything was to our satisfaction.

The grilled chicken was oily...like a grease slick.  The mashed potatoes were so salty, I almost had a heart attack after the first 2 bites!  Oh and the food was cold!  Really?  Its a 10 minute drive, and apparently it had been sitting for a while because it was COLD!!  Prices are way to high for the quality and quantity that you get.  STRIKE 2, YOU ARE OUT TGI!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

I love TGIFs, but this location is especially phenomenal. All of the staff is very fast, friendly, and attentive, willing to help you out even if you're not their customer. When TGIF came out with endless apps, it was a whole new world of awesome. Every appetizer on that list tastes great and they just keep coming and coming for only $10!

The lamp shade on a table we were sat at weeks apart from going was covered in dust both times. The floor looked like it had never been mopped when we went last week and in one spot it was clear something had been spilled and never cleaned up.

Last Friday,  we decided to go here for the $12.99 ribs. Ok, you ask, what do you expect for $13.99. Better than what I got, that's for certain. When my Memphis style ribs came to the table, I could not cut them with my steak knife. They were thoroughly tough and inedible. Called the waitress over and she said they would ""cook them"" some more. Ok. Manager brought my ""recooked"" ribs back to the table and trotted off. Again, could not cut into them. Waitress came over. I explained the problem again. She said nothing. So, I took them home thinking I could throw them in the oven. Ha. Wrong. Still tough. My dogs ate good that night. No lie. Angry, yeah very!!! Never darken their doorstep again. Gag.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005
