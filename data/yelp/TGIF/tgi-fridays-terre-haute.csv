Abigail M.,"Terre Haute, IN",54,111,129,3.0,1/5/2018,"Excellent drink specials - everyday of the week the specials change. We came in at a weird time in the middle of the day so the restaurant wasn't very busy, but somehow we still waited a very long to be waited on and even longer for our food. Our waitress was friendly and the atmosphere was typical. I found it interesting that your entrees come with pre selected sides and if you want to change them you are up-charged (and not told). I had the Parmesan crusted chicken with was a huge serving and very good. The tomato and mozzarella salad and the crunchy Brussels sprouts as sides. I liked the salad but the Brussels sprouts were disgusting. They were in a little Dish of oil, extremely over cooked and old, and the crunchy part was a handful of salad croutons mixed in. This is the side that I paid up for and I got probably 5 Brussels sprouts and 20 croutons. Everything was pretty typical of this basic chain restaurant, but I think I'd go to Applebee's before coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Kristy M.,"Marietta, GA",6,66,16,2.0,12/23/2017,Against my better judgement we went here out of convenience.  I probably haven't been to a TGI since I was in braces.   If they didn't serve yuengling   Black and Tan on tap this would have been a one star.  Chicken sandwich and burger we thought was a safe bet..  wish the chick fil A across the way sold beer.. we would have gone there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Doug B.,"Anderson, IN",671,211,209,3.0,2/25/2017,"I'm split on this joint. They have a decent bar and actually the best beer selection in town. However, the place is a bit run down. They've had some vandals rip the door handle off and it hasn't been repaired for months. The floors are often slippery and grimy as well. Either they are not doing very well, or the manager doesn't take the appearance and cleanliness seriously enough. Maybe he just needs to get approval for some remodeling. That would be ideal. I think this is a common problem in Terre Haute. If you're looking for a cool bar with a great selection of beers, keep this place in mind. I do think the bar is run properly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Jason D.,"Peoria, IL",63,15,7,5.0,8/15/2017,"$2 Long Island Ice Tees on the lunch special.  Now I don't usually drink adult beverages at lunch, but I was off today on a not so usual date with my wife.  We're on different work schedules. They have a great lunch menu here that is well done. Great  customer service with smiles and friendly environment. I highly recommend this TGIF in Terre Haute, IN. This chain restaurant is in the business of doing things right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
TheUnknown F.,"Clinton, IN",2,122,289,2.0,5/20/2017,"Today I took my family to TGI Friday's. The restaurant is clean and has a nice decor. The service was ok, the prices were high for what you got. I had a steak and it was cooked right and seasoned well but a little small for the price. The sides were ok. The girls got salmon and said it was ok, it was small as well. Over all the restaurant experience was a little underwhelming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Brook C.,"Terre Haute, IN",290,28,68,4.0,11/11/2016,My coworker and I had lunch there today and really enjoyed it! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very helpful and accommodating. I ordered a lunch special which was very affordable and filling. It was the 1/2 California club and a house salad. I enjoyed two $3 long islands which was also a great deal and mixed very well. Overall good experience! They did forget my dressing and my friend didn't enjoy her meal but those were small things in comparison to our overall experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Mason B.,"Terre Haute, IN",41,107,105,4.0,5/7/2017,"Hardly ever a wait to sit down. The food is pretty good usually don't stray away to much from the usual, which is a burger and some fries. The main reason of going is to hit the bar side, most drinks are reasonable and pretty cheap if you go on the right day. The same goes for shots. Cheaper than going to a bar for drinks and has better food. So a win in my eyes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Delsin K.,"Terre Haute, IN",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,I went in for a late dinner with my family and we received horrible service. We waited at least 20 minutes for drinks that weren't even correct. There were maybe 12 other people dining in so they weren't busy. Our female server kept blaming others for the several mistakes that were made with or drink orders. I wish I could give less than one star...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Jennifer M.,"Spencer, IN",37,17,8,3.0,4/19/2017,"We had some business to take care of in Terre Haute, so we decided to go to the TGI Friday's there. We had been to several other ones in the past, and were happy with them. Not so much this time. It was the worst TGIF's that we've ever been in. It took a ridiculous amount of time to be seated. The service was not good at all.  It wasn't really all that crowded, but several other groups of people including us were waiting to be seated and all the waitresses just looked at us and kept going.      When we finally got seated, I ordered a medium rare steak and it was way overcooked. I asked for new one and the waitress looked at me like I was being unreasonable. Our side salads were just barely average. My loaded mashed potatoes came with only chives! It was like pulling teeth to get that minor problem taken care of. We were completely done eating and ready to go when they finally asked us if we wanted a refill on drinks. They evidently realized what a bad job they did with us because when they brought our bill they apologized and gave us a $5 discount card on our next visit. We don't really think that we'll be using that coupon. I do not particularly recommend this TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute

Mohamed A.,"Terre Haute, IN",0,3,1,1.0,5/30/2016,We came at 1:10 am and the kitchen closes at 1:30. The guy who came to us is called Brandon. He told us to leave because the kitchen is closed. We asked him to ask the chief if he can serve us. He went asking him and the chief told him that he can serve us. Still he did not want us to sit on a table. So he gave me a paper and the menu and asked me to write my order and take it to the bartender.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute

Amanda L.,"Paris, IL",0,11,4,1.0,2/21/2016,"Sticky floors + sticky tables = major deterrent. Received one visit from our waiter the whole time we were there. Had to send my meal back due to overcooked pasta and rubbery shrimp. The manager was very courteous and offered a refund on top of a replacement meal, but I didn't have time to wait for new food. Just accepted my refund and left. I doubt my family and I will be back to this particular Fridays as the food and establishment are quickly unraveling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Lindsey M.,"Birmingham, MI",10,26,7,4.0,8/16/2015,"It has been a long time since I have been at a TGI Friday's. I was impressed by their current menu. I went ""all French"" in my recent dinner. The French Dip was full of flavor and had a unique mushroom sauce. French Onion Soup was a bit bland and had the taste of ""frozen then thawed"" chain restaurant soup. The service at this location in Terrace Haute was very attentive and friendly. All on all it was an experience that would make me want to try TGI Friday's  again sometime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Shelli S.,"Sullivan, IN",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2016,"Ive been to Friday's more times than i can count, and this particular one is closest to my house. My boyfriend and I have given them more chances at redemption than i would like to admit. Today however was the last time.  The last 3 attempts at dinner one or both of us have not received what we ordered. The last time i ordered the burger special, it was italian and delicious, but thats not the burger they originally brought to the table (1st round was the regular burger i.e. American cheese, LTP).  This time it happened to my bf, same scenario different burger, except this time I refused to pay $4 more for a burger we never received.  This is not my point though...my point is, i would like to have what i ordered the first time they bring food to my table and not offered a ""consolation"" dessert instead. If i wanted dessert for dinner that's what i would have ordered.  And this is coming from someone who has worked in the service industry for 16 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute

Caitlin M.,"Oxford, OH",82,106,51,4.0,10/5/2015,"Considering this is a chain restaurant in a mall, I eat here way too often as someone who prefers local joints. In the past, my experiences have been pretty hit-or-miss. Here are some highlights: With a party of 12+ women who used to work together in the mall, in the ""dining"" area: one server was kind of bitchy when we ended up having fewer people than we expected. It's one thing to say that only one person is going to be serving us, it's another to act like the paying customer is a total burden. Fortunately, we didn't have much interaction with her. We were a little rowdy but had a great time. Our actual server was very friendly, even if we could tell she might've been getting flustered with us. A bunch of us were splitting apps and desserts and ordering drinks every time she walked by. I hope the rest of my party tipped as well as I did, that's for sure. By myself, in the middle of a weekday, in the ""dining"" area: Waited almost ten minutes for a server to speak to me. Server takes forever getting any of my orders but is very happy to be talking to the person she knows at the table behind me. I order wings and fries. She brings wings and rice. I'm not sure what happened. ""Fries"" and ""rice"" sound a little bit similar but we had each said these words to each other multiple times. I basically had to yell at her to get her to understand what I wanted. I am now certain to ask for ""french fries"" any time I come here just in case. Any other time I have come, in the bar: Excellent, excellent service. It doesn't matter if it's the guy with long hair who always thumbs-up as he walks by to make sure you're doing okay or Courtney, who sometimes just sits down at our table to chat with us and make sure we're enjoying out food--I have never experienced bad service in the bar. This is a real bummer when we go in and they're setting up for a band, though, because it's a small space and live music can be a bit much in there, at least for me. They are always quick and the two servers I've mentioned have already started remembering our orders. On a food note: staple chain food that is dependable. Good wings. I really enjoy the miso, Spicy Sweet Asian Chile (or whatever the TGIF version is), and the parmesan garlic. DO NOT go for the PB&J sauce. We asked for a sample of it one day and I'm so glad we did. There was just nothing appetizing about it. If you go and you are all over 21, sit in the bar and tip your server well. They will take care of you, and you will have a fine experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute
Rhonda T.,"Bridgeport, IL",0,4,9,4.0,7/24/2016,Stack burger was big & meaty. Sweet potato fries seasoned to perfection. Staff was friendly courteous and offered us to go beverages.

Bryan M.,"Terre Haute, IN",0,6,,1.0,4/16/2014,"We frequent Friday's all the time. Living between two cities we dine at multiple locations but mainly the one in Terre Haute. As a customer there are expectations at both ends - from us it's patronage and tipping the staff to a degree that reflects the overall quality of service received. From the staff it's exceptional service, quality and integrity.     We arrived at 3pm and left at approximately 9:30pm. We tipped out twice between 50-75% of our bill vs. 15-20%. Accidentally, I left my sunglasses on the table. Noticing this this I immediately call. I explain the situation to which I'm placed on hold while she checks around. When she returns to the phone, she tells me no one has seen or knows about any sunglasses. I explain again that they had to be there as it had been only a matter of minutes that had lapsed. She offered nothing other than she was sorry. I hung up.    Integrity. I was seated in the booth farthest from any traffic and closest to the restrooms inside the bar area. The only people who were likely to come within reach of my sunglasses were either the server, the busser, or the hostess. And mysteriously not one of them had a clue as to where they were??? And this is what I'm getting at. I love Friday's, I have since I was a kid and they made menus out of oversized, paper sunglasses. But I refuse to support an establishment that's dishonest, who's staff is just waiting to rob the very people who sustain their revenue pipeline. I simply cannot. And for any of my friends and family who dare ask, I intend on telling them not just to walk away and go some place else, but to run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-terre-haute?start=20
