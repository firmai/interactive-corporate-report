OJIBOY N.,"Grovetown, GA",18,17,19,4.0,2/4/2017,"A go-to place for the fam. Food is consistently good and prepared fresh. We order To Go more than eating in the place, but the food is always just as good And packed well. The only issue we have is we cant figure out the rewards program?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Christopher S.,"Killeen, TX",25,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Poor customer service. Rude host.  Refuses to even attempt to accommodate requests, while lying to my face.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Jodi D.,"Killeen, TX",0,7,,1.0,8/12/2017,Bad Service. Food is not great! This place was good at at one point not sure if they are under new management but all in all this place is terrible! Don't waste  your time or money,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Hannah M.,"Enterprise, AL",58,5,1,1.0,1/14/2017,"Haven't been to this Chilis in a while. Husband convinced me to give it another shot. Needless to say won't be returning. Food was sub par, sloppy and didn't look fresh in any way. Watched the bartender scrape food off of a glass with his finger then fill it with ice and soda for another guest. Watched the other bartender open a chocolate syrup bottle with his mouth to pull the seal off and then proceed to pour into a glass. Three compartment sink was stagnant while bartender was cleaning dishes. Overall I would barely give this Chilis 1 star and I now remember why I waited 2 years to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Jamie J.,"Killeen, TX",0,12,1,2.0,8/9/2017,I'd come to this location for a quick bite with some friends and was wondering why it had been so long because I like Chilli's. I was quickly reminded why. The waiter was awesome....That was about it. The food was blah and when we first showed up it was kinda warm inside and smelled like urine (no joke the bathroom smelled better than the restaurant). We ordered drinks but it seemed like the waiter kept coming back to tell us why they couldn't make certain ones because they didn't have whatever ingredients to make it. I don't think I'll be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Luis C.,"Copperas Cove, TX",23,5,1,2.0,5/7/2016,Food was great Service wasn't Waiter didn't seem to care and was m.i.a. for the whole service minus the refill she brought,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Gloria C.,"University Place, WA",0,16,7,3.0,8/30/2016,"We were seated quickly and our server was very friendly which made up for the somewhat bad food. My husband ordered a burger and the fries literally tasted like they were moldy. I ordered a fresh mex bowl and it was actually very good. However, the menu said it came with fresh avocado and I didn't see an avocado in my bowl. I wish I knew the name of our server. She was friendly, suggested specials to us and even refilled our drinks without us having to ask. All in all, that was only our first visit. Could've just been an off day for the food so I might try again one day",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Cliff S.,"Copperas Cove, TX",43,45,68,5.0,10/25/2015,"I had a good experience dinning here on a Sunday afternoon.  The food was served swiftly and cooked perfectly! The service staff was very nice and attentive. They did a really good job.  Chili's has a great rewards program which is one reason I'm going to be a repeat customer, I was able to redeem a free serving of queso this visit!  Their Kiosk tableside devices are handy if you want to place an order if your server is busy, or to play games, and to quickly and easily pay. They are an added benefit, and an advantage over competing restaurants. They also offer good happy hour specials during different days/times of the week!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Fard D.,"Fort Hood, TX",16,6,,1.0,8/9/2016,This place was nasty and dirty. The food was cold I ask the waiter no bacon on my burger but she still put bacon on it. The first time she brought it out it was cool I just ask to take it back. But 5 minutes later she brought back another burger with bacon on it. I hate that place. I never had a bad experience from Chili's until I came to this one. And the waiter was gone I had to get up and find other waiters throughout the dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Kat S.,"Killeen, TX",3,10,,1.0,2/1/2015,"New decor, new management, they boasted. So I gave them another shot. Poor service, and plain, uninteresting food that I spent way too much on.  I never got a refill, or the extra sauce I requested. Thankfully they had the little kiosk things at the table to pay the ticket because the waitress was nowhere to be found.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Jennifer S.,"Killeen, TX",0,84,,2.0,4/12/2016,"Chili's used to be a great chain but with the recent revamping of their menu (which isn't the best), the service seems to have gone downhill. Do not go later in the evening, you'll be neglected!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Courtney M.,"Killeen, TX",37,53,4,1.0,2/20/2016,"My family went to dinner tonight at chili's. Got there around 6:50 seated around 7:20 wanted for service until 7:30. Since we had been sitting at the beer we already knew what we wanted so we ordered by 7:40. Tables around got seated and food and some left before we got our food! We waited til after 8:15 to finally get our food. My daughter's oranges were hot. My steak was cooked well done ordered medium. Of course we did receive several different reason why our food took so long....the chicken was taking longer then normal, the kitchen staff was very short handed, and the kitchen got crazy. Nonetheless we waited almost 45 minute for sub par food....worse service I have ever had at chili's. It will be a while before we go back....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
L R.,"Killeen, TX",4,11,,1.0,8/9/2013,"Chili's take this as a lesson learned - ""Allowing your employee to have their toddler seated at the bar where customers are consuming ADULT beverages is inappropriate"".  And, to the bartender 'Rebecca' who works evening shift, ""It is truly amazing what a simple phone call and an email w/ photos of you allowing your toddler to be seated at the bar while you are working to a local television station can do to encourage better parental choices"".  And to Chili's, ""If a customer complains to the manager about an employee allowing their toddler/ child being seated at a bar where adult beverages are being served, ADDRESS THE ISSUE.""  Taking down customer reviews on YELP may be your way of hiding complaints, but YELP is not the only site customers utilize to post reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Nicole S.,"Bertram, TX",5,8,,1.0,12/30/2015,"Came here with family around 230, there were tables open and no host/hostess to seat us, it took about 10-15 minutes to be seated. And even when we did get seated there was still a mess all over the floor! Our waitress was awful, no smile no nothing. She acted like she didn't even wanna be there and didn't even try to listen when my grandfather talked she asked him to repeat himself every time he talked and he talks pretty loud! It took her forever to come and check on us and refill my empty drink. My grilled chicken sandwich was eh, it was supposed to have honey mustard and honestly it looked like the chicken was just greasy or something, no honey mustard flavor at all. Was supposed to have lettuce, had maybe a few little shreds on it. My grandfather got food poisoning from his meal. We definitely won't be giving this chilis our business again. AWFUL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Shayla C.,"Killeen, TX",0,28,50,2.0,8/13/2014,Unfortunately had the beef enchiladas with black beans and cilantro rice. The black beans had clearly been microwaved. They were hard on the top and burst from overhead heat. Bad food but good service from Jessica. Shes really sweet and helpful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Chastity C.,"Killeen, TX",279,13,16,1.0,1/9/2015,"Ordered salmon and chicken...waited and never got my salad...then it was finally brought out with my meal. When I asked why I didn't get my salad first, the waitress said it's a side it always come with the meal. I have eaten at chili's hundreds of times and I have ALWAYS received my salad prior to my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Gabriel C.,"Harker Heights, TX",12,28,9,2.0,2/8/2015,Horrible Service tonight!!!! Appetizer normal wait time is 8 minutes... I ordered at 7:06 and got my order at 7:40... SMH!!! The kitchen was horrible... Management needs to be in that kitchen!! Get it together guys... Having a new Preps and Line cooks is not an excuse....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Amanda M.,"Killeen, TX",6,5,,4.0,1/27/2014,"For me this is one of those places you really like and end up not going enough. Some how I just never think of it? Food is great, staff is friendly and beer is nice and cold :) No wifi!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Marcus L.,"Killeen, TX",45,334,579,3.0,4/12/2013,It's just ok. Food was hot and just right. When it's packed service tends to slow down. Be prepared for a wait.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Renee M.,"Killeen, TX",94,10,2,1.0,10/30/2015,Didn't even get to eat here. Came on a Friday night and the host was completely lost. Sat two parties that came in right as we did and skipped the guy sitting down that had been waiting for 30min. Didn't write our name down or anything was just randomly pickings people to sit so we left and went to outback. Bad service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen
Myrtice M.,"Harker Heights, TX",1,6,3,5.0,12/23/2012,"I like this place to eat cheese fries, but I LOVE THE CHOCOLATE MOULTON LAVA CAKE.  I will go there and just get that.  The server will look at me funny and ask if I want an entre or a meal also.  Nope I say.  This cake is all I need.  It is a chocolate cake with a big scoop of vanilla icecream dipped in chocolate on top of it.  When you cut into this masterpiece of heavenly dessert, liquid chocolate and caramel comes gushing out. Ummmm-ummm makes me feel all tingly.....try it you'll feel tingly too!  (ps. I'm not the best speller so some words are probobly misspelled or the wrong word...is it dessert or desert??????",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen?start=20
Eva L.,"Killeen, TX",0,25,23,2.0,12/23/2011,Let me start by saying the service was excellent. Very friendly and attentive staff. The food was terrible. I've never been a fan. The only reason my Husband and I ate there is because we won a gift certificate after purchasing a vehicle at Automax. Otherwise I would have been very upset had we wasted actual money on our lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen?start=20
Tammy F.,"Killeen, TX",5,7,,5.0,4/29/2010,"Remember ""Cheers""..Where everybody knows your name? Chili's is my Cheers..When I arrive the staff and management always stop by to say hi and Rachel & Jennifer will have my drink ready in seconds when they see me coming!! The food is always awesome...Really like the new chicken nachos. Now if they would just bring back the fire roasted tomato dressing for the salads..yummmy..low calorie and tasty...I need to eat more salads and the other salad dressings have tons of fat grams...I'm just saying!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen?start=20
Justin C.,"Hilliard, OH",30,95,,2.0,11/29/2008,"Dont like this place.I went here on a date once and ordered a steak med rare.It was well done,but I did not want to argue,and it tasted fine,but the waitress insisted it be taken back,so I had to wait even longer for my food,and when the new steak came,was about the same.I didnt mind the 1st time,but then I got angry.Not a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen?start=20
Jai J.,"San Antonio, TX",447,1391,1366,3.0,6/9/2008,"Whenever I'm visiting the area I tend to gravitate towards Chili's... maybe it's partly because I never really get a chance to get out and see what else Killeen has to offer... maybe because I just like Chili's.  Who the hell knows?  I don't like writing about too many chains but this one stuck out like a sore thumb on the last visit I had.  Food was good.  Hot and fresh... which is how it should be.  Parking wasn't bad... plenty of spots.  Host and hostess were both friendly and inviting.  But the waitress... OMG could she get a freakin personality???!?  I actually started to reminisce about Ferris Bueller's Day Off when all you hear is ""Bueller.... bueller.... bueller...""  That was the first time I'd ever had such a bad server at any given Chili's... here or S.A. or Corpus... wherever.  I'll still give it 4 stars but only cause the food was good and the kids didn't notice a d@mn thing.  I think I laughed at my husband though when he kept pushing his empty glass to the edge of the table waiting for her to eventually see that he wanted more tea... Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen?start=20
Haley B.,"Austin, TX",91,138,24,4.0,9/14/2008,"Chili's is always good, and that means alot in this town. It's impossible to get good consistent service along with quality food and drinks. The people are always great, the food is always good, and you're never waiting too long. They also have really great brocolli, best brocolli ever!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-killeen?start=20
