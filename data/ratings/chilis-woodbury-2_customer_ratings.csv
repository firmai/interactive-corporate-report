3,Samantha R.,"Chicago, IL",26,27,5.0,4.0,2013-07-21,"Great location. Staff was super friendly. Got the usual skillet queso, which was great and loaded baked potato soup. The soup was very good, my fiance got the crispy tenders and loved them as well. Food came out very quickly and the new tableside tablets are great for kids, ordering more drinks, paying your bill, and getting appetizers. The only downside was the menus weren't very clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2?start=20,,,,,
1,William C.,"Nokomis, Minneapolis, MN",1,243,42.0,4.0,2013-07-22,Had the Mango Chile Chicken for lunch. Very tasty. It might be a little hot spicy for some but I found it very pleasant. The broccoli was very crispy and had full flavor. The white rice was ok.  I do not eat here very much but the people I was with seem to like the bottomless lunch items. It is a soup and salad combo.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2?start=20,,,,,
2,Matthew S.,"Walcott, IA",2,11,4.0,5.0,2014-01-13,"Never really had much luck at the Chili's where we used to live in Davenport, IA but thought we'd give it another try while we were getting out tires changed at Sam's. Definitely pleasantly surprised! Had some amazing grilled chicken and fall off the bone ribs and some really great customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2?start=20,,,,,
22,Holly H.,"Saint Paul, MN",1,77,21.0,1.0,2014-04-27,"usually a pretty good experience, however today was awful.  Ordered the chips & Queso-Queso came out ice cold & chips were cold. Asked a girl (maybe Hostess) who wasn't our waitress to send it back and she needed to know who our server was so they could handle it. Server came back asked how everything was so the hostess obviously didn't tell her about the Queso.  Told her about the Queso & she took it away and returned with hot or shall I say burnt Queso Dip-I didn't even know that it was possible to burn Queso.  My daughter had a corn dogs & pineapple-the pineapple was soggy & gross she wouldn't eat it. My son had Corn Dog & Corn on the cob. The corn was over cooked & not good. My husband and I shared the mini burger bites & some fries-good but nothing spectacular.  While we were waiting for our food my 8 yr old started to play the games with the little iPad table ordering thing & when our bill came we were charged $1.99 for table entertainment! It never even prompted us to say this game costs money!  Overall wasn't happy about the surprise charge of only $1.99 and that is mainly why I gave only 1 star because there was no disclosure warning etc that you would be charged.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
5,Katie B.,"Saint Paul, MN",3,4,,5.0,2014-11-13,"This place is great!!!! I love it! Yummy food, friendly staff, and quick service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2?start=20,,,,,
24,Caser S.,"Corona, CA",126,10,1.0,1.0,2015-02-19,"I wish I could give 0 stars. My girlfriend and I live in Woodbury, and decided to give this chilies a try. Horrible experience to say the least. She ordered fajitas and didn't get the salsa/guacamole that comes with it, so she sat there waiting for at least 15 minutes until she got up and bugged someone in the kitchen for it. After that, we did not see a waiter or waitress the entire time to refill our drinks. We were done and ready to get out of that place, but still no check!? Man this night went from good to bad, all from a simple dinner date. Needless to say, we will probably never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
0,Kimberly P.,"Lake Elmo, MN",0,11,,5.0,2015-03-28,I don't normally eat here but our service was great the waiter had a bunch of tables and still made us feel like we were the only ones,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2?start=20,,,,,
20,Birynne F.,"Saint Paul, MN",70,5,,5.0,2015-10-02,Service was excellent. It was Friday at 7:15pm when we arrived. I was nervous we would sit for an hour to get our food because it was busy BUT we did not wait at all! Chips and Salsa and spinach queso came super quick and our food came shortly after. To make the experience even better there is a device on each table that you can view your bill and pay with a credit card without having to wait for a server to get a check and pay so you can leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
25,T D.,"Stillwater, MN",0,5,,1.0,2016-01-14,"If I could give  negative stars I'd do it. In my opinion restaurant should be boarded up. Food poor, wait service no better. Wiped some liquid sauce from booth table top and was horrified to find grout was not reddish brown but rather it was dried sauces between virtually all tile. Maybe a visit from health inspector would be in order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
11,Naomi E.,"Saint Paul, MN",22,63,59.0,3.0,2016-02-23,"My son and I stopped here for lunch. He ordered the Fried Asparagus for an appetizer for us. It was perfectly fried with a wonderful lemon Aioli sauce. I ordered the Smoked Chicken Burrito and my son ordered the Bacon, Avocado Chicken Sammy. My burrito was very tasty and had a perfect amount of rice/chicken. The burrito was rather large and I could not finish it all. The fries were alright.  My son's sandwich was good, the Avocado was fresh and creamy and the chicken was not dry. The only complaint was the size of the Sammy was a little to big to fit in his mouth.  Overall it was a great experience.  The waitress was awesome and bubbly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
19,Bianca K.,"Davis, CA",0,12,,5.0,2016-03-01,We come almost every Tuesday and we love it! My favorite is the chicken enchilada and we have never been disappointed with this place. Everyone who works here is super cool and nice 100% suggest.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
18,Shelby C.,"Wausau, WI",5,6,,1.0,2016-04-10,"I stopped here with my boyfriend on our way out of Minneapolis for a quick bite. I manage at a local brewery & restaurant where I live, easily one of the busiest places in town, and I'm an extremely understanding person when it comes down to busy times/miscommunication but I've never been to a more disorganized place. First, we sat for 15 minutes without being greeted and I had to approach the host to ask for a server. Someone came right away, apologized and was very friendly. Food was...okay. My boyfriend didn't like his food. Our server came and asked how things were before we started eating but after that, no one checked on us. Our drinks sat empty the entire meal. We sat there waiting for plates to be cleared and our check for 15-20 minutes. Multiple servers and what looked like the manager walked by every 30 seconds and actually looked at us without doing anything. A girl did ask if we wanted a box though and after saying no and tried to ask for the check, she just walked away without saying anything. I also noticed how gross it was. The table was sticky from the previous guests and there was hardened ranch on the wall. My boyfriend played some sort of game console at the table and they charged us for it... I was thinking since we waited to be greeted, we'd at least get some sort of compensation. A waste of an hour and half. Neither of us will be going to a chilis again..this just proves why I've never liked chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
21,Paul S.,"Prior Lake, MN",0,6,,5.0,2016-05-18,This Chilis is now my favorite!  They just added a patio and it's really cool.  Nice view of the pond and the server Claire was awesome!  I had the Margarita Chicken and a ice cold beer.  I'll be back again and again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
16,Ka Noog Y.,"Murfreesboro, TN",27,77,67.0,3.0,2016-06-28,"Your standard Chili's. They do execeptionally well for catering to a bunch of girls, especially for coming in at such a busy time !! Good customer service, good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
17,Glen G.,"Arnold, MO",5,103,,4.0,2016-07-29,"Had a great visit. My waitress, Sydney, was very good and attentive. Had the Mexican chicken bowl. Excellent. No complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
12,Kalie I.,"Cottage Grove, MN",0,1,,5.0,2017-02-16,I actually really like coming here.  The staff are superb and the food is better than I originally thought.  The prices are reasonable and the menu is pretty large.   I usually come here on lunch breaks for work and I am usually served and done eating in 40 to 45 min.  So it is perfect!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
14,Lauren C.,"Jacksonville, FL",26,34,,4.0,2017-04-03,Good service and food. Typical chilis so nothing to complain about but nothing extravagant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
15,Jim H.,"Saint Paul Park, MN",0,3,,5.0,2017-04-04,"Just had a visit to Chili's last night. I had the boneless wing special (Buffalo and Hot Pepper) wife had a sirloin.  She said the steak was excellent and everything was prepared exactly as she requested (she had some special requests for dietary reasons).  The wings were great and way more than I could eat (brought the extras home for my son - and he immediately finished them off!) Only complaint would be the Hot wings weren't really all that hot - but maybe that's just me & my preference.  Service was, as usual, excellent. Anna is our ""other"" waitress of choice.  She really works hard to make sure that the order is right, delivered quickly with drink refills appearing almost magically.  She's also a great, fun and friendly person to chat with!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
13,Lisa J.,"Cottage Grove, MN",0,2,,4.0,2017-04-24,"Went there the other night w/my sons, my first time at a Chili's. Food was really good & plentiful we all left w/a to-go container. Service was good although server didn't mention her name nor was there a name tag so I can't give a shout out to her. The only thing I didn't care for was the ""pay at the table"" thing, although it may be quicker & easier it just seemed so impersonal. Will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
8,Jennie M.,"Hastings, MN",108,127,80.0,1.0,2017-05-06,"Updated:  Stopped in again tonight May 9. I was so disappointed to hear that the manager refused to allow my wife to sub anything at all in as a single side item when we asked to take off the rice, beans, onions, guac, and sour cream from a fajita order. Then, when I got my food, tge fries came out cold. When i told the waitress, she literally put her palm flat on top of the fries to see what temperature they were. I am glad she agreed that they were comd or she might have expected me to eat them after she touched them! The previous visit was awesome and the food on this visit is just as good but the customer service is lacking in the evenings, apparently. Previous review, 5 stars on May 6 Kathy is the best waitress! We got drinks immediately after being seated and was tgere to take my order as soon as I folded my menu. Chili's food is reliable, good and flavorful. Their loaded mashed potatoes are wonderful! I rarely order steak anywhere other than a steakhouse but I was in the mood for one. The classic ribeye that I ordered rare came out over. I hate sending food back because you never know what the next one will look like but this was too far over. The replacement was absolute perfection! Rare and delicious, not chewy or cold. Kathy took brought me a to go box for the wrong one and took it off our bill. She was the best server I have had the pleasure to work with in a very long time. I will definitely visit here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
9,Bria V.,"Saint Paul, MN",62,129,27.0,3.0,2017-06-02,"Pretty much what I usually expect from a Chili's, it's not my favorite place to eat- however I had a gift card so we figured we would go for some lunch. Food was OK, nothing good, nothing bad. Service was OK. We enjoy playing trivia while we wait on the tablets (children at heart). Still can't believe how expensive it is to eat at a large chain restaurant. We each got a beer, an appetizer sampler, chips and salsa and it was almost $60. Thank goodness for the gift card!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
6,Casey B.,"St Paul, MN",10,33,,4.0,2017-07-11,"Is this the best place to eat in Woodbury? Not even close. But, we love it for these reasons:  1) Great happy hour deals on drinks!  2) our three-year old loves the games available at the table, and you really can't beat $2 for unlimited use!  3) there's a decent variety in food. The boneless wings and buffalo chicken sandwich are pretty good.   4) the servers are great! really fast on refills and helpful with everything 5) the price for a kids meal and additional sides is affordable.  6) minimal wait if you get in right before dinner rush. Their patio is really pretty and unexpected for its location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,,,,,
10,Helen L.,"Boston, MA",14,2,,4.0,2017-10-06,"We were eating out as a group of 16.  We tried to get reservations early in the day.  Oops!  They do not take reservations for the day of your visit.  We were advised to call 30 minutes ahead so if there was space they could set up for us.  Our table was ready when we got there.  Oops!  I did not count.  As people arrived we found that we had a set up for 14.  As the last couple arrived we squished together to all sit together.  Good 2 for 1 happy hour.  But this did NOT include wine.  Good deals on happy hour apps.  All were pleased with the food.  Chicken fajitas were yummy and generous.  EXCEPT the steak fajita diner.  The meat was tough and lacking flavor.  Chew! Chew! Chew!  He left meat on his plate at the end of the meal.  Do not order the steak.  Soup, sandwiches and other choices were met with approval.  We will go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
7,Gwendolyn W.,"Geneseo, IL",87,4,5.0,2.0,2017-12-21,While I usually don't let one bad experience influence my overall opinion of a chain I am sad to say we will not be visiting this establishment again  I am a very positive person however I waited 30 minutes to order a additional 41 minutes for a salad to be brought out and waited 10 minutes before we left not one apology or even a notice on how long we'd have to wait at any point in fact in the middle of taking or order or waiter abruptly left without a word and didn't return for 5 minutes with no explanation it was by far the oddest and worst service I have ever experienced.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodbury-2,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
