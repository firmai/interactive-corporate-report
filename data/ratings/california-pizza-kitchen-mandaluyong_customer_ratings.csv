6,Jenny O.,"Maynila, Philippines",1,45,47,4.0,2015-04-28,"California Pizza Kitchen or CPK as it is fondly known is one of those restaurant chains that have stood the test of time with so many new restaurants springing up around it. Their price range is high but people still come because they do Italian food really well, have mastered the dishes they know are good and they have such a wide menu selection that remains exciting to their patrons. My forever favorites from them include the Hearth Baked Focaccia with Checca (dense but soft and just so yummy), Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad (the crunchy tortilla chips make it otherworldly), Sicilian Thin Crust Pizza (I love the bit of spiciness in the marinara sauce) and the Raspberry Iced Tea (yes, just yes). I've only recently eaten at their new location in the Shangri-La East Wing and aside from the update with their overall design and interiors; I received better service from them than I've ever had before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mandaluyong,,,,,
0,AJ S.,"Maynila, Philippines",41,270,275,5.0,2015-05-21,"California Pizza Kitchen is one of my favorite hangout places when I am with my barkada. It has a very chill vibe and their food is something I would totally die for. Despite having so many competition nowadays because of the sudden increase of pizzerias and Italian restaurants here in the Philippines, I still consider California Pizza Kitchen as one of the top contenders. This place is a little bit pricey, but I guarantee that everything you would be paying for is totally worth it.  One of my all-time favorites is their Spinach Artichoke Dip, which is served with crunchy tortilla chips. This creamy dip has a crispy-on-top texture that makes it look even more appetizing. It is also very light and fat-free so you can have as much as you want. Their crispy thin crust meat cravers pizza is also heavenly. It is loaded with Italian sausages, pepperoni, salami, and different types of ham that would surely make you drool. When you're in this place, you'll completely forget about your diet! No one can resist the taste and smell of authentic Italian food. PS: They also have gluten-free pizza! LOVE IT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mandaluyong,,,,,
5,Joash S.,"Manila, Philippines",19,230,227,5.0,2015-05-31,"California Pizza Kitchen has become one of my favorite pizza places just late last year. I can say that they serve great flavored pizzas and other dishes. I usually order the Sicilian pizza off their menu and this one is packed with all sorts of toppings namely salami, Italian sausage and spicy Capicola ham among my favorites. I also love their Tomato Soup and Caesar Salad. Since I usually eat at their Fort Bonifacio branch, I was glad that the Shangri-La East Wing branch already opened. I commend the staff in this newly opened branch for their great customer service. Attentive and sensitive to the customers needs is what I can describe the staff here. They aren't the type of servers who hover around the table but give you a sense of privacy. I didn't experience having to raise my hand for a refill of my iced tea or asking for the bill twice. I recommend this branch if it will be your first time to try CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mandaluyong,,,,,
4,Pauline Y.,"Maynila, Philippines",132,752,283,4.0,2015-06-08,"CPK is the absolute definition of an all-American restaurant and I'm glad it's located right in the center of Manila as the U.S. isn't exactly accessible in a matter of hours. It takes an entire day to get there but thanks to CPK, i can have my American food fix right here and right now. Everything is available here: from milkshakes (my fave!), starters that could very well serve as mains, dips, soups, salads, thick and thin crust pizzas, pasta, sandwiches, and of course, a slew of delectable desserts to cap off your meal. The quintessential dining experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mandaluyong,,,,,
3,Kathlyn Y.,"Manila, Philippines",70,321,343,4.0,2015-06-12,"I jus really have to say that California Pizza Kitchen is so California! By that, I mean that the places is designed like places in Cali. Even the waiters and waitresses dress like the ones there. I'm just impressed with how they really stick to the brand's theme. Yes, as we already know throughout the years, CPK definitely makes good pizza. Correction great pizza. They have all sorts of flavor and variety. It's just really hard to choose which one we want at times. The Barbecue Chicken Pizza is my absolute favorite from there. But one thing I really go to CPK for is the Spinach Artichoke Dip. It's served with crostinis. It's dip heaven! It's served warm and perfect. That was the very first thing I ever tastes from CPK and I just really loved it ever since!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mandaluyong,,,,,
2,Angel B.,"Anaheim, CA",1940,1245,4439,4.0,2015-12-30,"Yelp Challenge 2015  325/365 #800th review I was here on vacation from the states a few years ago, while at the mall, looking for lunch. We were super hungry and were enticed by the California Pizza Kitchen sign. KPC was nothing new to us, we were just excited to see some staple food from home. And Pizza too. So, why not. It was time to eat. We were seated immediately in the bar area. The wait for the resturant was a little longer. Service was friendly and attentive. Our waiter engaged us in conversation and was curious about our trip. Our pizza tasted exactly like California Pizza Kitchen does back home. Which was impressive. The cheese was fresh, the toppings was fresh. Everything was solid. Our bill with a generous tip was about half the price we would of spent in the states for the exact same food. I am sure the dollar conversion has changed over the years but it was super cheap compared to what we were used to paying. I am a fan and will return when I visit. #800",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mandaluyong,,,,,
1,Edna G.,"East Bay, CA",583,751,8771,4.0,2017-09-19,"For an American restaurant, this was a great choice. Prices are the same as the states though. At least, its located in the ShangriLa mall on the 2/3 floor. This is my mom and I place to go eat for American food. It's easy to find. We love their pizzas especially their surf and turf. We also like their thai crunch salad and sangria! For some reason, their beef is kind of tough and didn't like their pizza that had it. Good service and restaurant is clean. This will be one of my favorite restaurants to go to in this area. [107/100]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mandaluyong,,,,,
