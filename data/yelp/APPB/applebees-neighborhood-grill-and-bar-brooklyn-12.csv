Annmarie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,4,3,1.0,1/2/2017,Worst Applebee's ever! Took 45 mins to get a drink from the bar. 20 mins for my son to get his lemonade  50 mins to get apps. Waiter acted like nothing when I said something. It's not even busy cause then maybe I would understand. This place is really going down hill,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40
Sam K.,"New York, NY",73,9,1,3.0,7/1/2016,It's ok loud  bad annoying music and I have been here twice first and last. I mean the food is pretty good and kind of cheap so it's not that bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40
Allen H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,3.0,12/27/2016,"Came in on Christmas and it was very busy.  Sat at the bar and had a chicken quesadilla, which, most of the time is cooked just right, but it was just  so so this time.  There were a couple of slices where there wasn't much between the tortilla..(just air and the tortilla, where was the cheese and chicken?).  The ladies behind the bar were very busy but friendly and attentive... It's a shame that there is no sound for the tvs but the food is fine and the beer is cold.  If you come in for lunch, sit at the bar and say hello to Carla.  She is always pleasant, personable  attentive and hard working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40
Doma G.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,36,35,5.0,4/5/2016,Came here on a Saturday evening. It was packed and the lady said it'll be a 20 min wait but it ended up being 4 mins. We got seated and our waitress Sheresse was super nice and patient. We got the 2 for $20 Riblets and Quesadilla Burger along with the boneless wings. It  was very filling and delicious. For dessert we go the brownie bite which was also very good. Totally recommend this Applebees location. Nice staff and ambience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40
Christian V.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,13,9,1.0,4/30/2017,"The worst Applebees in Brooklyn,, The atmosphere is not wrong, they have valet parking which is pretty good, but the waiter that took care of us HORRIBLE. Talk about being a racist KENNETH the waiter, so he gets to the table and just throws ( Literally throws)our appetizer plates on the table does not bring any napkins does not say hello just walks right past us. To a table that got there After us takes their order greets them and then he comes to our table not friendly at all takes our orders in a hurry might I add,, and keeps it moving comes back 5 minutes later brings our drinks   Wrong and doesn't even bring my son's juice,, when we complain he brings back the wrong drink again and does not bring my son's drink still at this point me and my sister are aggravated as hell !! We decide to speak to the manager which was very nice and we decided we wanted another server but after waiting 10 minutes,, we decided to just get up and leave we just couldn't enjoy our meal after getting treated that way.  We decided to go to fridays on Harkness Ave excellent experience try it you wont regret and way better waterfront view!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40

Lewis Z.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",25,2,,1.0,6/22/2017,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the service that I received yesterday at Applebee's. I have been coming here for years and always had a great experience at this restaurant. Yesterday, I arrived with a party of 4 and was seated right away all the way back in the booth by the door on the other side of the restaurant. The table was not clean at all and I got salt on my arms from the damn table. We waited for about 15 minutes and had to flag down a waitress and asked for a server and she responded "" I will get you one, just give him a few minutes"". Another 15 minutes go by and I flag down the same waitress again and asks whats the holdup ? Then she says that the server is coming shortly and I said you said that last time. After a half hour sitting and not being acknowledged, we got up and stormed out of the restaurant. The worst part about this whole fiasco, it was not busy AT ALL. You lost a loyal customer Applebee's. Never coming back EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40
Alla D.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,8,2,1.0,10/25/2016,"Never eating here again! A week ago I placed an online order to go, I came in and was told it'll only be a few more minutes and to wait at the bar. Twenty minutes later the bartender told me they're packing my food up. Ten minutes later the manager came out to tell me they don't have what I ordered and he apologizes for having me wait 30 minutes. He tells me he'll pay for my dish and will make me anything else I want. He then tells me he'll have it out in four minutes. I ended up waiting another twenty minutes. Having spent almost an hour waiting no one even offered me water. The manager gave me a card for a free meal next time. My boyfriend and I went last night and I have never been more disgusted. The hostess didn't acknowledge us because she was too busy with her head down looking at her phone. I had to interrupt her from whatever else was so important. After we placed our order the appetizer came out great, but our two burgers took over 40 minutes. To make matters worse my side was wrong, and as I started to eat my burger several bites into it I couldn't eat anymore. The burger was Raw. They hadn't cooked it properly and I was completely disgusted. Thanks for making me sick! The restaurant and the team sucks. Because as we were trying to pay I handed my card to the waitress and she came back without it. Luckily she found it, and I understand long night nothing on her BUT worst experience ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40

Mariclaire N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,3,2.0,9/7/2016,"I come to this Applebee's enough to say that I was  very disappointed in this dining experience. It's like they were trying to be a Japanese restaurant where it would be okay to serve raw fish. Also hate being a pest and asking the waitress to tell the cook to recook the food, when I originally asked for it to be extra well cooked(which was grilled shrimp) and when it came back like the first time it still was undercooked. They only grilled one side of the shrimp and it was still raw. I ended up not eating any shrimp in my dish.

Ju C.,"Brooklyn, NY",220,45,169,3.0,6/7/2016,Got seated outside since the indoor seating area was full. Waited more than half an hour to get served. They only had 1 waitress outside doing the work for serving about 10 tables. This is not the service i was expecting. I've experienced a better service prior to today. Portions are big and filling. They have great deals for entree and appetizer. 2 for $20 and 2 for $27 and 2 sides each for the entree. Definitely filling. Taste is good. My complaint is how they're understaffed and slow service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40
Katie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,15,8,5.0,10/9/2016,"I laugh at all the negative reviews where people complain about the food here, this is Applebees not the Alinea !! Yes your food will be reheated frozen food, this is a sit down fast food type restaurant with a bar. Actually most people come here to eat bar food, drink, and watch games!! Your not going to get filet mignon when you order steak here. But seriously what do you expect when you pay $20 for 2 people? You get what you pay for. Food is good for the type of establishment this is, I've had worse at bars, and the drinks are always strong and yummy! Service is also fast and good! Also their beer battered pretzels are the bomb!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40

Tihia G.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",151,94,76,1.0,10/17/2016,"After a long day at work I came for a bite to eat with my husband and asked if they were playing the Jets game before sitting.  They said yes so we ask  where we can watch the Jets game and order a bite to eat.  Five minutes later the bartender name Rose  came over and change the TVs we are watching to soccer.  I nicely asked my waiter if you could switch our TV back to football and put all of the other televisions on to soccer.  When he walked over to the bartender she made it her business to scream loud enough that she was standing right next to us while she change the channel and we didn't say anything.  Unfortunately we were too busy into the Jets game, however even if I did notice a change in the television I would've waited for my server and politely asked him to put the TV back onto the channel we were watching.  After she screamed aloud so loud her comment I asked for the manager. Whom came over. I left the issue alone.  Continue to try to watch the Jets game but not  even five minutes later she is screaming to her customers using  curse words and constantly using the word retarded.

Angie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",249,6,16,4.0,4/30/2016,"Came here with my family on a Saturday night. We enjoy Applebee's. This one didn't specifically stick out to us, but it is a go to spot because it is convenient, close by, and it's right by the bay. The wait was not too bad for a Saturday night, it was about 30 minutes long. The food was decent. We got 2 sets of the 2 for $27 dinner and 1 set of the 2 for $20 dinner. For appetizers we got the spinach dip with chips, onion rings, and the hot boneless wings. The onion rings were a little too burnt for our tasting, but the two other appetizers were really good. We got a total of 5 steaks (3 were 8 oz. medium rare, and 2 were 6 oz. medium rare). All of our steaks were cooked to perfection, except my brother's. His was a little too over cooked. We also got the bourbon chicken and shrimp to share. That was tasty. Overall the whole meal was decent. The service was decent. If you ask me, there is nothing that particularly sticks out about this Applebees but it was a overall decent and enjoyable dinner. This is one of our go to spots for celebrations or those once in a while eat-out spots.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=40
Marc G.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,22,13,4.0,4/21/2016,"Food was great scenery was nice, came here late one night with my friends and family and we enjoyed in very much we were seated immediately upon entering and were given awesome full service, I personally felt like eating something hot (I'm not a rapper though). So as we seated we were given our ""books"" and I say books because there were multiple menus and insert and in general it was way too crowded to look at everything all at once, that takes a point away. Simply put it, you can't have an over complicated menu, while it wasn't complicated it was just all over the place especially when you have a few members in your party, Applebee's go fix that! I already finished school I'm not trying to go back just to read everything on there and figure the puzzle of which page or book belongs to which. Thanks.  Now as you finally figure out what you want to eat, you'll come across the awesome chicken poppers, knockers however they may call them, they are hot buffalo wings with the choice to get extra hot so you can burn the flavor right off your tongue. Luckily I saved myself the trouble and went with Mild. Next time... I then ordered the ribs with fries and holy Pigsus (Pig + jesus = no? Okay). These were damn good extremely tender and I love bbq sauce so they had a tangy flover along with a smoke cooked taste to them, they fell right off the bone, I ordered a full rack because I figured it was worth the money. It was..  Pineapple juice all day! Go try this place out it's a nice quick bite right before or after you're about to get f*****d up.

The glass was the size of my thumb nail and it cut my tongue, my tongue was bleeding. The server saw the bloody tissue. She quickly took the glass and told the manager to come... But they charged me for the dessert. I didn't get another salad. I wasn't interested in a free meal. But the fact that I could of easily have swallowed the glass, they didn't couldn't take care of the dessert.  Never coming here again and I'd advise everyone the same.

Annie N.,"Brooklyn, NY",146,243,677,2.0,11/10/2015,"This is my review for their online take out service, i had ordered the lunch special and it sounded like a great deal 2 for $10 but when i went to pick up my unch i had plain watered down mac and cheese without the chicken tenders so i had to call them up and ask what was going on, the manager said it was an issue with their online system and for some reason it doesn't show up on their system as mac and cheese with the chicken tenders.. hes like we get this issue alot with our customers. HELLO? you get this issue alot and you didn't bother calling to confirm if i wanted the chicken tenders which i paid extra for to be included in my mac and cheese? I had to ask him if he can have the chicken tenders ready for me to be picked up again and waste another 5 minutes walking and 5 minutes waiting for four peices of chicken tender... get your act together! if you are familiar with your lunch specials and you KNOW for the price i paid it comes with it, you should automatically include it instead of wasting my time and yours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=60

Rock L.,"New York, NY",1,11,3,1.0,8/19/2015,There are plenty of other restaurants in a close proximity you should go to. Their French onion soup is terrible and their new attempts at reinventing a hamburger are pathetic. The sign a restaurant is run right is if the bathroom is taken care of as well.

Crystine W.,"New York, NY",752,1201,281,1.0,7/8/2012,"This was by far the worst Applebee's I have ever visited and I am shocked that it is still in business.  I should've read the reviews prior to coming here because that would've saved me a lot of trouble.   They offer painfully slow service.  We sat outdoors and there were 2 other tables seated there (although one was leaving).  It took 15 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge us after we had been seated and then an additional 45 minutes for the server to begin bringing the food out.  If they were busy and I was at a high-end restaurant, I can understand it taking a long time for my food to be prepared.  At Applebee's, these foods are mostly deep-fried, thrown on a plate and then served ... it also didn't help that on my way to the bathroom, I passed a table of at least 10 servers just yapping it up about some DUI one of them recently got.  Our particular server was also careless and gave us the wrong information, first telling us that we wouldn't be charged for something and then later telling us that it would be an additional $8 charge.  We were very thankful to leave as soon as we finished our meal, which also tasted really bland and dry (chicken and potatoes).

Melinda B.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,82,48,1.0,3/10/2015,"I never thought I would see the day that I would no longer want to come to Applebee's but that day has come.  We came in with our son excited to try the new apps they have been advertising. Of course our son wanted a cheeseburger and fries, so that was his meal. We came in during happy hour so some of the apps are half priced. We knew we wanted to try two of the new ones so we ordered the pot stickers and spin dip from the happy hour menu and from the 2 for $11.99 menu we ordered the brisket sliders and double crunch wings. Now having been here plenty of times before we were figuring between the two of us that would be plenty of food with some left over. Wow were we wrong. All the appetizers are half the size of what they used to be. And the 2 for $11.99 came out and it was two of the smallest plates I've ever seen. We actually thought they brought us the wrong food. So we waited till the waitress came back with the rest of the food and asked her if those were actually the 2 for $11.99 and the full size apps and she said ""Yes, the appetizers are smaller now."" Umm, That's an understatement, miss. I definitely don't see myself coming here for any reason but for a few beers during happy hour cause any meal that will fill you up, they raised the price on and anything cheap will leave you still hungry.

The taste?  SALTY Nothing compares to how this chain used to be in the 90's when it was actually cool to eat here, but you can tell only people with low class come here to drink like there's no tomorrow.  Seriously, it's 2PM; I hope you have a job.

Paid and when she returned with the receipt she once again had drawn a heart over the recommended gratuity.  I understand they are kids and are working for the tips but how do you screw up not one but two things and still push for a higher tip. 2nd one  Then last night went to the car pickup and door and it was locked.  Rang the bell 3x's and waited 15 minutes.  When they did open the door the rug would only allow for the door to open enough to put your head and hand in.  For some reason food was at the bar... had to wait again. When she returned with the food, she had to go get a total...had to wait.  Then when I handed her the payment she had to go enter it...had to wait again.  Seems like a lot of waiting.  Wasted an extra 25 minutes because I wanted to have a quick easy dinner for my family.   Somebody should help them get their act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=80

It had applewood bacon, chipotle sauce, pepper jack cheese, tomatoes & onions with a thick burger patty. The meat was a bit on the dry side, the dressings was better than the meat. For appetizers I had boneless buffalo wings; they weren't that spicy and also at room temperature. It might not be fair to compare this Applebee's with another since it's a chain, but the other one I went to served at least 15 pieces of boneless wings, this place however served 8 pieces. This Applebee's thinks it's a Manhattan restaurant or at an airport. Many things that belong in the 2 for 20$ are in a separate 2 for $26.99 section. I don't like to be skimped or ripped off. No dessert here. Small portions. Food is mediocre. Quality is mediocre. -Service: 4 stars The lady who served our table was pretty nice and hospitable. She always kept on a smile.

I will try to not go there again, but its a regular spot for some of my friends so I will have to push them away from there and to a Chili's or Red Lobster or something.

The hostess told us twenty minutes, and when twenty minutes came I asked a bout how much longer and she almost told me twenty minutes again. Smh I reminded her of how long we were there and she then said 15 minutes. We continue to stand and wait in the very crowded and packed entrance as we are shooed from the bar, the entrance and everywhere. Meanwhile as someone slept on the couches used for the people waiting. As we are waiting lots of people were leaving yet no ones names are being called. 4 tables that could've sat at least 2 per table just remained with rejected food, dirty dinnerware and no sign of anyone emptying and cleaning to let others sit. From the time we began waiting to the time we were finally seated. Our waitress was pretty good but watching as other waitresses leaned on the wall and sang gangnam style instead of waiting on their tables was the perfect lasting image of thus place.

We were seated pretty quick. I asked to go to the bathroom and had to walk through a maze like environment. It's so inconvenient. The tables are so close together and the bathroom seemed like a mission to get too. I'm surprised the stalls had toilet paper. There were no towels to wipe my hands with. I went to go sit at the bar and the stools were uncomfortable to sit on because they were wobbling. When we ordered our food we didn't wait long. When the food was brought out the waiter TWICE switched our order so whatever I ordered was given to my friend and vice verse. My friend ordered potato twists and instead he got plain chips with cheese. Who wrote this menu ? It was literally chips and cheese. My wings were good. The drinks weren't as strong. The waiters seemed inattentive and boring. When I commented on how i liked the waiters shirt because it said ""Hello Brooklyn"" on it instead of replying oh thanks! he said ""it's our uniform...""

I have this OCD where I have to leave exact change for the waitress because I feel like its helping her...yes odd...but whatever...I have this weird thing with bills and giving the person the exact change if I have it. She is taking forever returning with our change...so we decide, ""eh lets just get up and walk over to her, she seems busy."" We are standing behind her and she doesn't realize it. I come to the realization that she is bad mouthing us about giving her the loose change in the bill. Why oh why does she care? I did not realize that giving her 55 cents would make her so angry. I say excuse me, she turns around and is shocked to see us and plays it off like she was not talking about us. I just laughed to my wife, got my $20 and left just finding this entire incident so stupid.

My mom's chicken was too spicy, but the shrimp and mushrooms were ok.  Her bro had a steak w/shrimp which was ok as I tasted it.   But wait, where is the soups?  oh waitress... she comes over and  says the 1st waitress was supposed to pass it on.  But, after 10mins  the soup comes.

Joe P.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",23,20,2,1.0,5/18/2012,"This is the worst place I have ever eaten at.  I see people giving good reviews and I have to say that they should have their Yelp rights revoked.  I know better than to eat at a chain restaurant but I figured how could they screw up a burger? First, I ordered a side Caesar salad and when I received it, it tasted refrigerated and the croutons were stale.  I then ordered one of their ""signature"" burgers. I asked for it to be cooked medium rare.  I was told that they can't make it this way.  Im still trying to understand why.  I specifically asked that it not be well done.  Sure enough it was well done and the bacon was undercooked...better yet it was cold.  The burger itself was cold and I asked to return it for what I ordered.  So believe it or not, they brought me another well done burger.    With all that said, when I took one bite of the salad and pushed it away the bartender didn't even ask what was wrong with it.  Likewise with the burger, all they asked was if I was finished. In conclusion, the kitchen staff is terrible, the service is completely oblivious and doesn't seem to know how to service their clientele. The best part of the entire place was the valerie guys who got me in and out of there fast.   Sad that I have to actually give it one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-12?start=100

Their cheeseburger egg rolls, wanton chicken tacos and loaded nachos are fantastic. However, the entrees were a disappointment. I ordered the mac n cheese with chicken fingers because they described the chicken as ""honey pepper chicken tenders"". To my dismay, they turned out to be ordinary chicken nuggets that were on the dry side, mixed into a bowl of very uneventful tasting mac n cheese. I took a bite of my fiancé's dish which was the brisket enchiladas. They looked amazing in the menu photograph, but were not very good at all. How do you mess up a dish like that? I didn't taste the burgers from the kiddie menu, but they looked gross and the boys hardly touched them. The best entree they have ate the ribs.

She give me the drink with an attitude and I swear I think she gave me back the same exact drink. So ever since then her attitude began. Tried the new pot stickers they sucked! Filling was weird, sauce was weird. Might not have been properly cooked do to me being sick this morning. I had the fiesta lime chicken with mash and I saw pink inside my chicken so i didn't eat it. I didn't send it back because I was so disappointed I didn't wanna say anything. When my weird mojito came I needed water I told my boyfriend to ask for water because I didn't want any more attitude from her. Suprisinlgy she brung me a glass as well. The dessert was the only good thing. Triple chocolate melt down. It came so fast tho obviously it was microwaved. Even my mojito was nasty like I dont understand.

We received drinks on the house and because I'm diabetic I can't have regular soda and she brought a regular Pepsi and an alcoholic iced tea.
