1.0,"Jan 24, 2017","Former  Server/Bartender  in Cupertino, California","[' Benefits package is a joke. You can only qualify if you work an average of 35 hours per week during a quarter. As well a you must maintain that average afterwards. Therefore if you take a vacation for a week, your average will dropped and you will be dropped off of coverage. This happened to me. That pretty much prevents someone who needs that health coverage to ever take a vacation.']"

3.0,"Oct 20, 2016","Current  Employee  in Norman, Oklahoma","["" There isn't much that is offered, since it is a restaurant. You are permitted to ask off, you just have to get your shift covered. There is an easy to use app, HotSchedules, that makes all of that easy. They are pretty good about letting you off work if you're really sick or an emergency happens.""]"
3.0,"Sep 08, 2016","Former  Employee  in Sacramento, California",[' If you are given stocks you are taxed very heavily on them. The medical insurance varies by state and was affected poorly by Obamacare. The free meals are wonderful and can be used at every location.']

3.0,"Mar 04, 2016","Current  Food Server  in Moreno Valley, California","["" The best part is the offer everything. 401k, health insurance, life insurance, and vacation. The worst part is they keep making it harder to get these benefits. I worked there 10 years and now you only get 3.4 hours if you work 35 hours a pay period. It use to be 30 hours and it use to 4.9 hours. To get health you must have 34+ hours it use to be 30. They keep changing it so pretty much unless you're a cook you'll never see any of these benefits.""]"

2.0,"Jan 23, 2016","Former  Supervisor/Bartender/Server  in Austin, Texas","[' Well, to be eligible for benefits you have to be considered a full time employee. As a server you are not allowed to work full time hours. They track your hours and when you are approaching the threshold for full time eligibility, you are either not allowed to work or they will call you off for your shift saying something like, its a slow day or we are overstaffed so take the night off. Luckily I was a supervisor and a cook as well so I was able to get the hours I needed.']"

3.0,"Jul 17, 2015","Current  Employee  in Denver, Colorado","["" It's great to have a 401k offered to even low level employees. They matched 3% for a limited time. The health care they offered before the mandate of the new legislation was much better. I guess having it available means they personally want to spend less money so the coverage is not so great now. For instance, I went to the hospital a few months ago...$6000 in med bills yet only about $500 was covered and I've basically met my deductible for the year with that since the deductible is $5500 I believe. Same thing with glasses...it covered my eye exam and abut $50 of the rest so I still ended up footing about $400 even with basic cheap frames. The health care isn't worth the price. Free meal for hourly non tipped team members and 50% off for tipped, when at work. When coming in off the clock 25% for you and your guests.""]"

3.0,"Apr 22, 2015","Former  Senior Manager  in San Mateo, California",[' the worst thing is that a lot of the time we are short managers and its really hard to plan your vacations when you plan on taking one because there wont be enough coverage.

1.0,"May 04, 2015","Former  Server  in Houston, Texas","["" It's essentially non-existent, because you have to consistently work 35-40 hours a week for three months straight, and they don't let you do that for scheduling purposes.""]"
