Lynne A.,"Tarzana, CA",770,841,898,3.0,10/14/2017,"I was visiting one of my work locations Oct 10th and got to go lunch for one of my employees and myself here. I had the Caribbean grilled chicken salad, and she had the Santa fe crispy chicken salad. We called it in, but she said it wasn't ready when she arrived, and had to wait almost 20 minutes more for it. It tasted decent but didn't have much greens in it, was kinda skimpy. She said hers was better months ago, and they changed something in the recipe. But for 23.00 for lunch cant beat the price. I like to treat my employees to lunch, so it served the purpose, not sure we would go back though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10
Candice M.,"Modesto, CA",19,4,,2.0,1/12/2018,"This location has seriously went downhill,  we got there and they weren't busy at all but we waited about 10 min before anyone came to seat us, I think there was only 3 maybe 4 people working seriously . Our server was very rude. We go to chilis ALOT so we know what we like and how we like it and every time we ordered something it was either like an argument or just bad attitude , we ask for extra chips like 5 x before we got them , the food was horrible, I ordered chicken tacos and got flour tortilla with a piece of avocado, this used to be our favorite location but we moved closer to turlock and it's been about 2 years since visiting the modesto location, I was in shock how bad it was, smh I will never go back there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10
Rich S.,"San Clemente, CA",12,8,,2.0,1/5/2018,"I've had better steak on deployment, which means, chili's get a grade lower than "" institutional use only"" , or, they have no concept on how to cook a low grade ribeye. I get that they don't serve the best cuts but this was dismal.

Thien H.,"Riverbank, CA",648,639,2941,4.0,3/10/2017,"We've visited this Chili's after a day of shopping at Vintage Faire Mall several times. The servers have all been nice and efficient.

Wanda E.,"Downtown, San Luis Obispo, CA",11,1,,1.0,11/30/2017,"We ordered Fajitas and normally they come hot and still sizzling, not the case, it was all cold even the beans. The steak was overcooked, chicken tasteless and the shrimp was very low quality. However, despite our bad experience, the waitress was very  accommodating, it's not her problem the food was terrible!

S B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,63,32,3.0,11/17/2016,"So I'm all excited. I'm out on the road and I get to eat on the company ticket. Yay. I might as well eat at a nice place! Except there is a problem. It's Modesto. Yeah. A city that thinks it's San Francisco. It has a couple high rises. It has a parking garage. But it's not. It's Modesto. A city who's motto proudly states ""At Least We Aren't Stockton."" Come on. It's a cow town. So here's the dilemma - where am I going to go? If I were in the mood for Mexican, there are LOTS of great Mexican places here. But I'm not. I'm actually thinking about a burger. But a nice one. Enter Chili's. It's a known commodity. It's no Morton's, but it's no Denny's either. (If I let you eat at Denny's, it means I hate you a lot.) They don't do anything particularly great, but they do almost everything. The thing they do best is their ribs. They don't do great ribs, but they don't do shabby ribs. I'd have the ribs but I don't feel like making a big mess. I don't need to drive to the site with rib goo all over my shirt and pants. The burger menu looks enticing. The girl comes over to take my order. ""So, is it possible to get this burger lettuce wrapped?"" She kind of has this confused, estranged look on her face, thinks for a moment, and says ""These burgers are really too small to wrap in lettuce, um, so..."" Wow! Say no more, honey! And thanks for your honesty! I can clearly see that this isn't going to work out! Just give me the steak and shrimp combo, rare! You go to Denny's and get a steak, you get an overcooked piece of gristly meat that is tough to chew plus it isn't very big. This isn't that, it's a pan fried sirloin. It won't knock your socks off but it's a reasonable cut, and, as expected, cooked more on the medium side than the rare side but was okay. Again, this place doesn't 'do' steaks. They have them, they do a reasonable job. The shrimp? Well, they were okay. Again, not great, but not bottom tier either. The asparagus was there for presentation mostly, it was pretty much burned to the hot plate thing. I left kind of wanting more. Not more necessarily, more taste I guess. I eyed the Italian place. Should have gone there maybe. I probably could have gotten a ribeye. Oh well. Look, if the whole, one person lunch with an ice tea hadn't set me back thirty bucks out the door, (or rather, set the company back thirty bucks) I would have been joyed. Not overjoyed, just joyed. If it were half the price, I'd probably add a star for value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10
Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1670,147,857,3.0,10/22/2016,"Arrived around 9:30 pm, wait time was only 5 min. There is plenty of parking as this Chilis is in the Modesto mall parking lot. The service was really slow but the food was decent. We ordered the honey chipotle boneless wings to start, which I really enjoyed. We also had the chips and salsa with guacamole. I really like the chips here, they are nice and light, only issue is they break real easy when dipping into the guacamole. Thought I would go different and order the prime rib fresh mex bowl. It is prime rib over citrus chile rice with green peppers and onions, house made corn, black bean salsa with avocado slices. Topped with pastille- honey chile sauce, tortilla chips and cilantro. It was decent but I probably wouldn't order again. The kids ordered the steak and chicken fajitas, which are always good. Besides the slow service it was a decent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10
Natalie C.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2017,If I could give a negative 1 i would Definetly give them that. I had the worse experience ever we were a party of 10 and were not even aknowledged. It took 20 min. To even get water served to us. It takes another hour to get our food. When the food finally came it was all cold the food was so cold there was a layer of Greece on top of it.

Angel C.,"Modesto, CA",57,36,245,4.0,8/22/2016,A favorite of my brothers for their phenomenal steaks.  The server was really cool and the food and drink was top notch.  I accidentally ordered the nachos not realizing they are not a basket but prefer topped individual chips like 12 of them.  Originally I was going to deduct another star for the lower food count but the nachos as is were pretty decent. They all had cheese and chicken.  I did deduct one star though because I really felt that the nachos were not really properly pictured to avoid the sticker shock of standard nacho fare.  The toppings were minimal as the chips were already drowned in cheese and chicken so not really able to do anything else with them like putting tomatoes or guacamole. On the bright side the server was pretty fast with our orders and he was always on point with checking on our drinks and ensuring the accuracy of our order.  Next time I won't order the nachos and will re rate the whole experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10

Coleen S.,"Modesto, CA",0,32,10,2.0,2/21/2017,"Not a big fan of this place in general, been to a bunch of different locations throughout Northern California and this one is by fast the worst. The one in Stockton and Fremont are the best. The service is ALWAYS slow and 8 out of 10 times the food is either wrong or cold. I enjoy the queso and chips and my kids like to eat here so I go here a few times every few months to satisfy their cravings. I really hope they get better with custom service as time goes by I know a lot of people like to have drinks and appetizers here. When we went this past weekend it was pretty slow during our visit and yet we didn't get helped in a prompt manner and our food was wrong. I would say Red Robin has much better burgers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=20
Justin G.,"Stockton, CA",6,1,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Well I should have known it was gonna be a horrible experience when we first walked in as the hostess didn't greet anyone, and when she was calling out names for when tables were ready the person standing 2 feet in front of her couldn't hear her. She would only say the name once and if no one responded she would just go onto the next name, didn't bother to check to see if anyone was waiting outside or anything.  Well, we get seated and our drink orders are taken and brought, we order and wait, and wait and wait some more.  It's Monday and the NFL is on, we seriously waited for food for almost half of the game, and all the while our waitress never once came to see if we needed refills or to check on us at all.  But that didn't stop her from talking for minutes on end to what I suspect was a fellow non working employee who was seated behind us.  So finally our food is brought to the table my kids are starving by this time and everything is ice cold.  Seriously I had ordered fajitas and the skillet and its contents felt as if they were sitting outside in the 30 degree weather for 30 minutes, oh and did I mention that it was a different employee that brought the food.  We still hadn't seen or heard from our original waitress for over an hour.  When I tell them that they need to take my plate back as its ice cold the waitress gets an attitude and then goes and gets our original waitress who doesn't seemed to be all that phased by my issue with my fajitas basically having frost on them, we then let them know everything is cold but since my kids are practically starving we don't really have an option but to let them eat it, since god knows when they would ever see food again.  The waitress then storms off flailing her hands in the air and a while later brings my fajitas back, hot this time, and tells us she is sorry but the kitchen is messing up orders and is messing with her money in the process. My sister in law ordered a salad which didn't have any salad dressing with it, we let the waitress know after she went on her little tirade, in the mean time the manager comes over to apologize about everything and to let us know she would be taking a discount off our meal for the inconvenience. In the meantime the waitress brings the salad dressing and manages to completely disappear for the rest of the night never once coming back, but she still managed to take her sweet time talking to the person behind us time and time again, so we finish eating and go to pay for our food and notice nothing has been taken off of the check or any discount what so ever. So we have to hunt down our waitress she then looks at our tag and leaves doesn't say anything then comes back and takes the discount off and leaves doesn't say anything, we ask her for a box she says she will get one but almost 8 minutes go by and she had passed us twice, I had to get up and basically walk into the kitchen to get someones attention to finally get a box so we could leave.  In all it took over 2 1/2 hours to get out of there. Needless to say someone basically lost their tip with how they mismanaged the situation by never trying to make up for it. Horrible, never going back to this location and yelp really needs to allow people to leave no stars, cause that is what is deserved of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=20

On to the food, I mostly order off the lunch menu which is cheaper and has good sized portions. I also like how they are constantly adding new things to their menu and giving you more choices.

Cole slaw was just a dry bit of cabbage and only 3 fried pickles. They also forgot my side of pickles. Beef patty was good but it was as if that was the whole burger. If you order one hopefully it's better than mine. Chillis chain is great but this one I will never visit again. My wife's shrimp tacos and daughters grilled chicken were ok though.

Why a company would even refuse to accommodate a family, especially a disabled family, is beyond me! I understand there are policies in place, but our job as managers, servers, and cooks, is to make the customers happy to the best of our ability! You seem to struggle with that? When complaining about their meal, this family was met with unprofessionalism to the max, being ignored, hung up on, called idiots, etc. Instead of the manager taking it upon himself to fix the situation, he did the opposite.

Their bar drinks are served topped with ice, a sure sign that they are in trouble.

I ordered the loaded potato skins sans green onions with ranch and they were pretty good and not very greasy unlike some places. Our entrees were the Southern Smokehouse Burger with no bbq sauce and no pickles and the Crispy Crispers with ranch. The burger apparently was made with extra pickles rather than no pickles, BUT it didn't come to the table that way. Priscilla told us she noticed the mistake and promptly had them remake the burger so when it came to the table, it was perfect! The crispy crispers were done perfectly...the fries were properly seasoned, the corn on the cob hot, sweet and juicy and the chicken had the proper amount of crunch covering the juicy chicken. Dessert was the brownie sundae and I admit, I wasn't expecting it to be anything special, but my god was I proved wrong. That brownie sundae was so freaking good...I mean it was PERFECT! Ice cream for every bite of hot brownie, thats right, the brownie is made fresh to order...mmmm it was delish! This was the best experience I have ever had in a restaurant.

M N.,"Turlock, CA",0,96,,1.0,3/9/2014,"Yuck! Fajitas were flavorless and chicken tenders were pure salt. Tenders are always salty, but these tasted like they put 4 times the amount of salt they should have.. Not edible. The only good food were the chips, guac and salsa. Service was average. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=100
Brad N.,"Modesto, CA",0,6,,4.0,12/23/2012,I come in frequently for the happy hour and so far its been a good experience every time.

Dan D.,"Modesto, CA",0,52,3,1.0,10/29/2014,"We usually hit Chilis once a month and its usually decent, never a great meal, but decent. Went a few days ago and it was horrible. Was not greeted at the door, took awhile to get a table and then it seemed to take awhile to get a server. First off the drink order was wrong, thought no big deal at the time but it went downhill from there. Server didn't come back for a long time to get our order, there were 2 servers and 5 small tables at the time. Got our appetizer of potato skins, they were not crisp but soggy, and there was a lot of potato meat, they are usually a little meat and nice crisp skin. Then the meals came out. I had chicken and shrimp fajitas, the whole plate had a pool of oil the meal was sitting in and the bells and onions were practically raw. The other order was grilled chicken sandwich, the tomato was crispy, the bun was cold and the fries were barely luke warm and looked like they had been fried a couple of times. During this time we tried to get the staff of our waitperson but they were no where to be seen. Felt like we just threw forty bucks away. It will be a long time before we go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=100
Mike H.,"Home, WA",12,7,,2.0,7/12/2011,Slow food service. Bad food for outrageous price.  Waiter was nice but slow. Had to ask mgr about 15 min late soup (got half sandwich with soup). At least he comp'd my meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=100
K H.,"Pomona, CA",30,56,,3.0,8/16/2011,"Mediocre food, it's pretty much impossible to find anything on the menu that doesn't have an entire days worth of calories in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=100
Noelle M.,"San Francisco, CA",212,407,163,4.0,12/14/2008,"Wow, who knew I would 1. ever go to a Chili's and 2. actually give it 4 stars!! Srsly, I could not have been more happier about my experience here. As a former restaurant manager I just look for the little nuances that create an ""above and beyond"" experience- and chili's has it all.  For one, I came in (the door was opened for me) sans gramma and mom to put our name in- since it was high lunch time and thought there might be a wait- there wasn't and the host offered to take me right to my table, despite my whole party being there (huge plus!) but I decline since gramma and mom were right behind me, when they came up, noticing my gramma's difficult time walking they opened BOTH doors for her- huge plus, totally taking advantage of hospitable opportunities.  The second thing I loved about chili's is they have a ""guiltless"" menu- as a former rest. mngr. I def packed on a few extra lbs- so I have been watching my weight and having a guide there really helped- I also love healthier, low fat, high grain options (I got a chicken sandwich on whole wheat bun with steamed broc accompanied by a balsamic vinaigrette - it was WAY good). Now, granted, it is a bit cheesy to have a ""low cal"" menu- but with a 5 page menu I appreciated a simplified version for me.  Service was great and attentive and the food was good- a great choice if you're at the mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=100
Paige W.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/6/2013,Love it ! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. The servers are always polite & refills our drinks.

Bill A.,"Modesto, CA",0,109,,1.0,8/12/2013,"I believe that there is no reason why chain restaurants can not produce good quality. Chili's obviously believes otherwise. Many years ago Chili's in the bay area was my happy hour hang out with co-workers. I had not visited one since and probably should have stayed away and kept the happy memories. We ordered, but could not eat, what has to be the most awful and disgusting fajitas produced anywhere. This is processed food at it's very worst. To be this bad, it had to have come frozen in a pouch produced in some far off factory. It did come with rice and beans, but like the worst scenes of a horror movie, it's best to close your eyes and cover your ears, to the side dish. The description of some things should be avoided. To the restaurant's credit they did ask if we wanted something else and deducted $10. from the bill. After waiting what seemed an eternity for this horrid fare, we wern't about to wait any longer to give the place a second chance. A polite and attentive wait staff, but unfortunatly they work for an absolutely lousy restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=100
Christine W.,"Modesto, CA",0,21,,2.0,2/2/2013,"Service was less than desirable, once our server took our order and brought it to us, never saw the guy again. My husband ordered Carbanaro Steak which should have come with onions, green and red peppers, mushrooms and a cheese sauce, had tons of mushrooms, maybe at best three thin slices of red peppers and a slice of green peppers and some onions, and for the cheese sauce.... if there was cheese in it, it sure didnt taste like it! The server offered to take it back, but fear of a ""sneezer"" stopped my husband from sending it back. Like I said, our server never came back to see if we needed re-fills on our drinks, when we were done we had to ask the greeter at the door for our check, then had to wait to get the check back to sign off, and our credit card wasnt with the check. My husband had to chase down the server to get the credit card. I would have said someting to the waiter and manager but my husband wouldnt let me. I just know I wont be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=100
