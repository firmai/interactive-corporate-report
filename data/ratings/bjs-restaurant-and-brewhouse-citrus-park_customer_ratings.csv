If you want decent micro brew, edible burgers, pasta dishes, pizza, ribs, etc., this is the place to be.  I've been 3 or 4 times because of the menu variety, and there is something for everyone.  So now matter how picky the people in your party are, everyone should be pleased.   Best thing on the menu?

162,Richard A.,"Odessa, FL",0,44,,2.0,2012-02-25,Last night my wife and I went to BJ's to try their new Asian menu.  We've been to BJ's many times before.  This time it was not very good. We ordered two glasses of wine.  I thought that the wine was a dollar or two more than any other local restaurant for the same brands. My wife ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and I ordered the Terriyaki Shrimp. My wife said that her meal was OK.  I had to send mine back.  The dish was loaded with pepper.  Terriyaki is not a peppery dish.  I then ordered Chicken Marsala.  It was just passable. I will say when I had a problem with my meal the waiter acted to correct the situation immediately.  The manager picked up the bad meal and appoligized. I think that BJ's is probably best for burgers and pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006

I had a glass of good stout, probably better than anything else at my table. The service was good and the manager was circulating, keeping his eye on things, asking patrons how they were doing.

Some beers are good, others yucky.  Nice to try them all and try to nail down the differences. Skip the avocado egg rolls.  A bit band and noneventful.  The nachos are meh.  But the bacon cheeseburger pizza is TO DIE FOR!   Literally and figuratively.  It even comes with tiny pieces of pickels.   I don't recall having such a sinful delicious pizza since the Pizzeria Uno days.

BJ's is located inside Citrus Park Mall, right near the front entrance and opposite Red Robin (Yummmm!). We had some client reports to finish, otherwise we would have likely enjoyed a sampler of their craft beer. Instead I went with an iced tea, but made a note to come back next time for a beer. The menu is loaded with the standard mall pub grub, but I did see some nice lower calorie selections, and a lot of soup & salad options. There's the usual flatbreads, pizzas, salads, soups, appetizers, sammies, burgers, wraps, and so on. I had the lunch-portion teriyaki shrimp stir fry over rice and it was quite good, and only 245 calories. The stir fry was made with grilled shrimp, sautéed with onions, red peppers, cabbage, green onions and baby carrots tossed with teriyaki sauce and served over sticky white rice topped with sesame seeds.

Their menu was very extensive and detailed; there is something for anybody there. I had the grilled chicken pasta, which was absolutely delicious. Not only is BJ's a restaurant, but it is also a brewhouse. They have many of their own beers there which is great for those who like to venture into different craft beers every once in a while. I'll definitely be going back. I highly recommend BJ's - great staff, great menu, and great beers.

I am not a big beer drinker but they have a lot of craft beers to try so that was interesting. All I care about is that a beer taste good so this might be a place to try a new beer next time. We were here for the FOOD!!! I had the New England clam chowder in a bread bowl and the ultimate mac n cheese I think was the name. Both were delicious but like Abby said for us non-readers, I forgot to note it said something like CHIPOLTE which means it would be HOT!!! It was still great but it really did not need the chipolte!! I sample a little of Donna's tomato and mozzarella salad. It was delectable but small. However her stuffed baked potato looked like it was grown in a field next to a nuclear power plant. I am not kidding when i say it had to be 3 or 4 pounds!!! My eyes popped out of my head. Overall I think everyone was satisfied.

My latest trip to BJ's was for take out and I utilized their curb side Togo which was nice. There are 2 spots by the front that are available for curbside. Since my New Years resolution is to eat healthier when available, I decided to skip my go to (it has ranch dressing and crispy union straws) and I tried a salad off their new ""enlightened"" menu-basically everything is less than 575 calories.  I ordered the thai mango salad.

113,Camaron A.,"Clearwater Beach, FL",375,248,67.0,4.0,2013-01-23,"I visited this place on NYE 2012, a good friend flew in late from JFK ( late of course typical JFK bs)  She was starved and it was her first time in Tampa and on top of it our options were dwindling as the clock ticked towards midnight.  We figured we would just go to Red Robin , something simple and quick and satisfying after a long and drawn out day. As we got there we noticed BJs next door and they were open , looked alot nicer so we figured we would try them out. It was quite busy for NYE  but ,fortunately we were seated right away. My good friend ordered a BJs Blondie beer and I ordered some tropical fruity cider beverage.  The place is huge but also very cozy in a upscale atmosphere. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful throughout the entire dinner. We started with the typical Spinach and Artichoke dip which was not typical at all , it arrived with a multitude of colorful fresh tasting chips and very fresh spin on a app that has become so overplayed in recent years. My friend ordered the Roast Beef French Dip sandwich a favorite of her's. Her choice was good but nothing great. I ordered the Black and Bleu burger which was good and ample but below par compared to Burger 21 or Square 1.  We opted out of dessert but the dinner was over all was good I would give it a B-, given the circumstances , the time and date it was a better alternative to our original choice and the beverages made the experience even better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=120,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006
149,Mike W.,"Linden, NJ",119,247,644.0,4.0,2013-02-14,"Wow. What can I say? A restaurant that brings together great drinks, good atmosphere, and an impressive menu. Let me first say that this restaurant, at least on Friday and Saturday evenings, usually has a 30-45 minute wait, but they do offer call-ahead seating - take advantage of it! The first think you will be introduced to when you get seated (or approach the bar if you're waiting for a table) is the well thought out menu of beers crafted especially for this restaurant. There's a little of something for everyone- lighter beers, heavier beers- and even a seasonal beer fitting the appropriate time of year. The menu at BJ's has EVERYTHING. Literally. Pizza (wonderful), pasta dishes (excellent), chicken dishes (you gotta try the Parmesan crusted chicken), and more. Honestly, I have no idea how the kitchen keeps up with everything that folks order, but they do. I've been to this restaurant twice and have been very impressed with the skill our meals were prepared with. The only thing I'd like to see changed is the dessert menu - it's very heavy on baked good (ie. cookies) where I'd like to see some more creative items on the menu to match the rest of the offerings. There's gotta be a beer recipe or two that they could use. Overall, a very good choice for dinner, especially if you have a beer lover in the family. Just be sure to call ahead and put your name on the list in case they have a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.088,3.4000000000000004
154,Eric S.,"Murphy, NC",0,9,1.0,2.0,2013-02-23,"First I will state we are big fans of BJ's and have dined in many of their restaurants across the country....We were so happy when the one came to Citrus Park. One of the draws for us is the handcrafted beer, we especially like the Jeremiah Red. We stopped by Saturday around 4:30 for an appetizer and a beer after shopping. The restaurant was slow preparing for  the dinner crowd as there were a lot of servers standing around doing nothing. The beer and food was as usual and expected...what was disappointing for us was the service and cleanliness of the restaurant...It started when  I used the brass hand rail and my hand stuck to the rail, then we were seated at a booth that my wife hand to wipe the seat.....I put my elbows on the table (bad manners) and the table was so sticky they stuck....wait...then I open the menu and there is food smeared all over it....makes me really wonder what the kitchen looks like these days. There were two male managers working the floor and they obviously had some type of disagreement happening which created a stressful vibe in the place. It seems the current management is not up to BJ's standards as this is the worst we have seen it in years. Hopefully corporate will show up and clean the place up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8560000000000003,3.4000000000000004

My mom was in town and we did some shopping and decided to sit down and have a drink and walked into BJs right when they opened around 11am on a Monday. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly.  Mom got a pinot grigio and I got the house brewed hefeweizen draft.  It was really good-but $5.25 for a beer always chaps my @$$...guess that's pretty standard. For lunch, mom ordered the veggie burger (would never eat that so I didn't taste it) and I ordered the Caesar salad with the shrimp tacos. I will dream about those shrimp tacos! There are 2, they are stuffed full but not so full you get all messy.  Comes with chips, salsa and 'avocado cream' on the side which is basically a less thick version of guacamole.  Very delicious and not too filling so you don't feel like a cow trying on clothes afterwards. Will definitely go back again for a draft and those shrimp tacos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=120,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.22,3.5200000000000005
136,T T.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,17,18.0,5.0,2013-03-08,"Finally a great deep dish, Chicago style pizza establishment in Tampa! No more cravings for UNO Pizza in Orlando! (although nothing beats their deep dish!) My wife and I decided to eat at BJ's at Citrus Park Mall for lunch. We were greeted at the door with a friendly welcome and smile. We were promptly seated by the hostess, and shortly thereafter Maria introduced herself as our server, again with a friendly smile, and took our drink order, which arrived very quickly. We mentioned to her that this was our first time eating here, so she took the time to explain the different menu options, and with the many questions we had, she was VERY patient with us. She gave us plenty of time time to review the menu, and checked with us occasionally to see if we were ready to order or had any questions. Not once did we feel rushed, or forgotten about. We decided on the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza. Our pizza arrived very quickly, less than 20 minutes, all the while our drinks were continually topped off. The pizza was thick, hot and tasty! If there was one down side to the pizza, it was a bit dry. There seemed to be a lack of tomato sauce, but the sweet crust and other flavorful toppings were great. Maria continued to top off our drinks and took away any trash/dirty plates and was very friendly. We could not have asked for a better server, props to her!!! The atmoshere was very good, clean and inviting. Several big flat screen TVs were placed throughout the establishment, all showing a different variety of sports, not to mention the huge 4 screen TV behind the bar. The restrooms were elegantly clean and tidy.  I look forward to my next visit so I can explore the other menu options, like the pizookie and their own home brew! We will ask for Maria to be our server next time as she was exceptionally wonderful and friendly, and hopefully BJ's will step it up on the tomato sauce!!

I did get a tad annoyed at having to wait over 5 min for a hostess to greet us, but the service the rest of the time was good so no biggie. We ordered two items off of the ""small bites"" menu to start with, which is essentially a small one-person appetizer. We choose the buffalo & blue cheese crispy wontons and the bruschetta, both were delicious. Upon ordering a sandwich for my meal, I was told how gigantic they are so we split a bbq pulled pork sandwich with fries. Honestly, the pork was dry and I wasnt impressed. It seemed like it was missing something besides the pork, onion strings, and a toasted bun. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but given the appetizers and good atmosphere I would come back. Bj's also has a huge menu of craft beer but I dont like beer enough to pay 6$ for a glass, so I cant give an opinion on that.

When my wife, two children, and I arrived at Westfield, I noticed that BJs was crowded. So my wife decided that she and tke kids would go to walk through the mall, and I checked in and got a buzzer. We were told it would be about 15-20 minutes, so I put the buzzer at the bar, went to the restroom to wash my hands, came back to the seat at the bar, ordered a beer, and started watching the Rays. Altogether about a minute and a half.  Before the (very nice and attentive) bartender could deliver my Piranha Pale Ale, the buzzer went off. I was cool with the immediate seating, but somewhat peeved about the ""underpromise"" seating practice. Just tell me what's going to happen and fulfill those expectations, so I don't send my party somewhere else when you're prepared to seat us. Then, as I was standing at the hosting stand, trying to get a hold of my wife, things got shitty. One party came through (without ever holding a buzzer and with a wink from a server) and was seated right next to the bar. Ok, whatever, they know a server, and a lot of restaurants seat adults in areas like that before parties with kids.  Then, a second party, who had arrived later than we had (same total number and same number of children) was seated in the front area by the windows.  My family got back, and we were standing in the lobby, surrounded by other families. I clutched the beer close to my leg, trying to hide it. I'm more comfortable drinking a beer at the bar than in the waiting area; that's just a weird thing to do. After about five minutes, I asked the hostess what was up. Our table was ""being cleaned."" It took about thirty minutes for this table to be cleaned. When we finally were seated, it was at a table I can only assume is number terrible. The server station is actually attached to the booth, so as the servers retrieve silverware and other table settings, the drawers are slamming on our backs. Moreover, busy servers store discarded food on top of this station. It's literally so close that you could be enjoying your meal, have a hearty laugh or a stretch, and end up dropping your head on a plate of (canned, reheated, half-eaten) spaghetti. We're still waiting on our simple order of two kids chicken tenders, a jalapeño burger, and a corn fritter app. It's been an hour. I will never come back to BJs; we'll just go next door to the more appropriately priced Red Robin or the more foodie Giordano's instead. Or even Johnny Rocket's, at least they have a theme.  Both my wife and I are very busy professionally, we spend about $800 a month eating out. None of that will go to BJs anymore. You don't expect Bern's, but you don't expect blatant, unwarranted, and simply strange bad service either. If I could give 0 stars, I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.5320000000000005,3.6800000000000006

163,Christie L.,"Vancouver, WA",7,36,,1.0,2013-08-11,"Let me first say that we have gone to this BJs for several years now. The beer is always good and the food has been OK. The quality of the food has gradually gone down hill until I finally had my first 'I can't eat this' experience. I love food and when I am really hungry (like I was today) I am not even that picky. I ordered their 'new' Bison burger cooked medium. The server said 'good choice'. Clearly this guy has never eaten this piece of crap. I love Bison burgers but I know the food here is never that great so I didn't even have super high expectations and like I said, I was starving!!! It comes out and here is the breakdown: (1) the burger is a tiny burger on a HUGE bun with a HUGE piece of lettuce, took me about 5 bites to even hit the crappy burger (2) 2 bites in to actual burger and I have to pull a sharp, hard piece of bone out of my mouth (3) the burger is an under-seasoned, greasy, and mushy piece of what had to be a previously frozen patty (4) I asked for it to be cooked medium but it was pretty much warm on the outside and raw mush on the inside I eat about 3 bites of actual burger and decide I can't continue. I don't think I have ever not eaten a meal at any other restaurant, it was that bad. The waiter asks if I want a to-go box and when I say 'No' he smiles like 'that good eh?' so I felt obligated to enlighten this idiot about the fact that this burger is so disgusting I can't eat any more of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=140,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.6600000000000006,3.5600000000000005

116,Thea H.,"Tampa, FL",27,91,3.0,4.0,2013-09-15,"There are very few places that I would want to be a regular. This is my place. My fiance and I started going to the one in Pinellas Park when we were first going out and I took him there for his birthday. When we moved in together, we started going to this location all the time. We just love this place. The service at this location is hit or miss but only once has it been terrible. The atmosphere is sports and beer with fully clothed male and female waitstaff. In other words, you can take the kids here and have a cold one. The huge screens are for ESPN, ESPN Classic, ESPN 8 ""the ocho"", etc... Beer is also a highlight of this place. It's a ""brewhouse"" after all. The drink menu is extensive but so far I have fallen in love with the Berry Burst Cider and the Double Berry. My fiance enjoys the Black Velvet most of the time. We have tried a few other drinks but those seem to be what we like the best. After so many visits, it's hard to be objective about the food because I've had so many things on the menu. Appetizers we enjoy are the calamari, crispy wantons (buffalo and thai), and the potato skins. The potato skins are double fried so they aren't my favorite. Hands down my favorite entree is the jambalaya. Finally it's a dish with sausage I can eat! It's so perfect with the spices they use. It is a hot dish so if you hate spicy, this is not for you. Another great dish is the balsamic glazed chicken. There have been times the chicken was too dry but when the chicken is just right, it's perfect. I also love the crispy onion strings. So tasty! Desserts are the best here. You can't go wrong with a pizzoki but a real hidden gem is the baked beignet. It's perfection- crisp beignet with ice cream, strawberry syrup, and whipped cream. It's so light and delicious you'll want more than one.

I thought this place was just another faux brewery house with bar food, but I was totally wrong. The beers have very cheesy and corny names which didn't make me feel like trying anything, but it was lunch on a weekday, so I really couldn't anyway.  After reading the Cheesecake Factory sized menu, I decided on one of my goto's which is Chicken Parm. I ordered the lunch special which was $12 I think and it comes with a soup or salad. I chose the chicken tortilla soup and was surprised to get a whole bowl of it. I also ordered thai chicken wontons because they were only $3. Those were also delicious like the soup. The entree was big for a lunch special and the chicken parm was crispy and juicy. The marinara was spicy and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly. The service was excellent and my drink never got less than half full. You get a lot of bang for your buck here and low prices are not indicative of low quality as they are in other places.

They were not busy at all so we did not understand why they were taking so long. Then the waiter ""in training"" spilled a drink on a guy in our party and did not tell the manager, (he tried to cover it up) he didn't seem apologetic at all. They also told my friend that she could not have her free birthday dinner that she had previously been told she could have if she signed up and got a BJ's card. once the manager was told, he apologized and gave everyone half off our meals and gave the birthday girl and the guy that had the drink spilled on him, free dinners.

They're one step above your mass produced varieties, but nowhere near as good as a true craft brewery. BUT, they typically have at least one or two good guest taps.  On this particular day, the bartender, nor another employee, could tell me what the 7venth Sun beer was on tap. Just 'it's an IPA'. OK. The brewery makes lots of varieties of those. And they seemed non-plussed that they didn't know. You are a beer bar. If you're going to have guest taps, maybe your bartenders should know what they are. Then my receipt had a completely different beer on it. Maybe I shouldn't have expected more at a chain restaurant/brewhouse in a mall. They have great food.

I had chili breadbowl with caesar salad. It was very good, the breadbowl was uniquely toasted. I tried an 8-beer taste test flight.  It was ok, I don't typically like all the different beers at brewpubs so I just do a trial to sample it.  I was happy with that.

That sums up my experience.  A very regular meal ended up being a 2 hour affair.  The drink orders went in rather quickly and we had a server who advised she was in training so at first it was almost great having 2 people watching over our table as there was a mentor type person with her.  Once we placed our orders, however, we had a new server who must have been overloaded as he was pretty scarce after taking our orders.  I was also left without a beverage and never got  refill during the entire meal.   As far as food goes, we had a few sharers at our table who split a pizza that looked pretty good.  I had the jambalaya, which was overall pretty decent for a chain restaurant.  We did indulge in a pizookie, which is their version of a chocolate chip cookie made in a small pizza pan topped with ice cream.  That was probably the highlight of the entire experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.1160000000000005,3.3200000000000003

64,Randy G.,"Lutz, FL",4,285,366.0,4.0,2015-01-26,"Wife and I have been hmming and hawing about trying out this restaurant for quite some time now. Most places that have a huge menu selection usually only make avergae meals at best. BJ's is the exception instead of the norm. We started off with a pepperoni pizza dip and it was amazing. a plethora of cheeses and Marinara suace topped with small cubes of pepperoni and serves with small thin slices of garlic toast. The wife had parmesan crusted chicken that was so thin,tender, and definately crusty cheesy. I had the lasagna that was actually oversized raviolis filled with numerous cheeses and covered in a sauce and mozzarella cheese. Delicious. Now even after all of these great treats the dessert was the pinnacle of the meal. Salted caramel Pizzookie. Now a pizzookie is a 6' round deep dish pizza pan that they add cookie dough to the bottom of the pan then run it through the pizza oven, once on the other side, vanilla ice cream is added then toffee pieces, then caramel and chocolate sauce is drizzled over a shot of whipped cream. A perfect end to the meal. I washed all this down with thier made in house root beer that had hints of sasparilla and birch. Very refreshing and a great taste. Our Sever, James was very professional and very friendly, we will definately go back and ask for his table again. Now as for the atmosphere, its a sports bar environment so expect high levels of noise. The hard floors and shape of the dining area promote echoing and amplification of conversations but if you are a foodie, then the food always takes priority.

92,Lauren C.,"Dunedin, FL",124,741,216.0,3.0,2015-03-15,"This was my first visit to the citrus park BJs location. The experience had a few ups and a few downs so I'll settle at an average of 3 overall. I called in to reserve a table when I was on my way as I figured they'd be busy on a Friday night at 7 pm. But when we arrived there was only a 5 minute wait since we called ahead. Our server greeted us right away and provided excellent service throughout the whole meal. For drinks, I started off with the orange twist mocktail.  I really like that they have a nice section of alcohol free drinks (4 different mocktail flavors in total) in addition to their full bar and impressive beer choices. My friend and I took our sweet time deciding what to get as we were chatting a bit and the menu is quite extensive, which doesn't make for an easy decision. Since I couldn't decide on ""just"" one thing I opted for the tomato and mozzarella small salad to start followed by the corn fritters and gourmet mac n cheese. The salad was 2 thumbs up, fresh, excellent flavor and nice presentation. The mac and the corn fritters came out next. I've had the mac before but it seems as if they've changed it now. It was decent overall but nothing out of this world or ""gourmet"". The description of the corn fritters on the menu ""served with jalapeño, bacon bits and spicy aioli sauce"" makes it sound better than it actually was. They were overly fried and not all that flavorful. The guilt of eating a fried starch was not worth it In this case. Finished off the evening with a mini white chocolate macadamia pzookie.  OMG. Perhaps I'm the only one who had never experienced that deliciousness before, but wow was It good! And the mini was just the right size. Overall Overall I enjoyed it enough that I would return again but perhaps try something else like a pizza or entrée.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=100,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9880000000000004,3.2800000000000002

Food - Our appetizer was the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Too much of the wrong flavors - just didn't work. I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya.

171,Ren C.,"Tampa, FL",170,245,153.0,3.0,2015-09-12,"i'm a fan of this chain restaurant. The reason why is that of the Pizookie. They were amazing.  But anyways I wanted to say that when i visited this placed again (coz i've haven't been back to this placed for almost a year.) I was kinda disappointed. I came here with friends for bday dinner but with all the great experience that I had at this place before they just went down. At first we decided to wait for one of our friend to arrive so we did not order yet. But when we figured that he is running late I decided to try there peach Margarita. And so the server checked my ID and did not even mention that it was my bday. no greeting or anything. at that point i got disappointed. if you are really checking DOB you should have noticed that the individual DOB is that day.  Then we got hungry and our friend haven't arrived yet and so we ordered appetizers. The appetizers were great no doubt. so we told our server that we are doing the 2 for 25 dollars (comes with salad or soup, pizza and pizookie). I ordered the clam chowder soup, which is a lil bit salty, then we decided to order the Deep dish spicy hawaiian pizza, my friend notice that the pizza did not with chicken and so they have to make another one with the correct order and we ended up having 2 deep dish pizza, and then the pizookie (as always there were to die for).  while we were eating my friend notice a lil friend on the floor (roach) and he took a picture of it. he tried to say something to the server but we can't get his attention. i have the photo of the lil friend if you want to see it. haha.  all in all i was disappointed at the service. i was expecting better service especially coz it's my special day.  3 star because of the pizookie that i always love. message me if you have some question.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8920000000000003,3.4800000000000004

184,Brian M.,"Tampa, FL",1610,507,7691.0,2.0,2015-12-01,"At the suggestion of a coworker, we visited BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse located at Citrus Park Mall off Gunn Highway and the Veterans Expressway, not too far from our office for lunch. I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil, Parmesan cheese, with white cheddar mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli. Unfortunately, it was really missing flavoring and left me craving for something more. My coworker got the New Orleans Jambalaya with blackened chicken breast, shrimp, chicken andouille sausage, bell peppers, white onions, tomatoes, in a spicy sauce, served over rice pilaf and he was a little dissapointed that it was too dry. My other coworker got the Garlic Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza with grilled chicken breast, basil pesto, fire-roasted red bell peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, parmesan, and goat cheese. He really liked it and ate the whole thing. You can't screw pizza up ever lol. The decor is pretty average and unmemorable. Cons: Over the phone, BJ's Brewhouse told us they had plenty of lunch specials but when we got there their lunch menu had only 4 items. I didn't want pizza or salad so were forced to order off the dinner menu for $15-$18 per plate which is higher than average for lunch. Service was terribly slow for a place advertising come here for work lunch. I had to ask the waiter 3 times to put my order in and we had to wait over 15 minutes to get our checks and then another 5 minutes to pass the pen around. Considering we had over 15 people and over 3 tables of people, you think we would've got more than 1 server. People kept asking where the heck did the server go?  One of my coworker's $12 burgers came without tomatoes and onions which is a basic burger topic every burger should have. He ended up eating the whole burger before the server showed up again so he didn't bother asking. Due to the slow service, it ended up being a longer than expected lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=20,3.24,3.4,3.4,3.3040000000000003,3.3360000000000007

The most recent visit (yesterday), I was there for our work holiday lunch so there were 12 of us. They gave us ONE server who got switched out halfway through. The server only took half of our orders and then we had to flag down a different server to get our server to take the rest. Our meals all came out at different times. Totally unacceptable.

76,Luis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3,,3.0,2016-01-10,"I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from this place. Just having moved from the West Coast, my wife and I have been actively seeking out what Tampa has to offer in terms of casual hangouts with decent food & drink. The menu is eclectic & fairly health-conscious, and that plus NFL happy hour got us through the door. Unfortunately, our first impression wasn't so hot. We arrive, there's a wait. Totally understandable with it being a Saturday night. So we saunter on over to the bar thinking ""ok let's grab a few drinks while we wait, no biggie."" I sit myself down, make eye contact with the bartender, and I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And it really seemed like he did everything he could to help every single person around instead of me. Including several who arrived after me. I don't know if it was my face, what I was wearing, or if I reminded him of someone he hated in high school. But it was borderline hilarious; even the random people around me were making comments about how long it was taking. Literally 10 minutes I stood there being totally obvious about the fact I just wanted to buy a drink, and it's not as if the bar was overly busy. I'm not going to be rude to a bartender and start blurting things out or waving my hands around at them after we've already made eye contact a few times. Because of my profession - for better or worse - I've been in hundreds of bars & the cues are obvious. So finally, after about (no exaggeration) the 6th time he walked past to help someone that had arrived after me I blurted out ""you going to help me or what?"". He sighed really big, said ""what do you want man"", and I thought ""you know what, I don't really want a drink from you"" and walked away. It was just a weird interaction and borderline hostile. So after that awkwardness our party actually had a GREAT time. The food was pretty tasty for a chain type place, lots of good options. Calamari was yum, and the Jambalaya was decently spicy & flavored. Drinks were super cheap/strong, our service was attentive and perfect. Dessert was a 3-way pizzouki thing that got devoured in about 7 seconds flat. Even after being presented with a last-minute check split our server settled us up to a T. All the rest of the employees seemed super nice & everything seemed clean & well-presented. No complaints. I don't know if I'll be back, mainly because I don't want to see weirdo bartender again, but I can recommend this place to anyone that wants a fun, affordable night out with friends in a casual environment. Sometimes it only takes one bad apple to leave a bad impression... but your mileage may vary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=80,3.04,3.38,3.38,3.468,3.2440000000000007

For a group of 8, we were placed in a 2 sided booth that was very cramped and impractical. Eating properly was difficult let alone going to the bathroom. Secondly, our drinks came out very slowly. While I can understand this for cocktails, beers should not take that long at all. Lastly, our server did not get our dessert order correctly and did not stop by our table to check up until well after to deliver the check.

It was so noisy it was hard to hear (we were a party of 6 people at a long table.) They have call ahead seating which you may want to take advantage of if you are a larger group... The menu is like a bible -- barely got through half of it. A little daunting... The kids had several choices of meals. Seemed to like their pizza and spaghetti. One couple shared their special dinner for two for $25. Each had a soup (said the broccoli cheese was outstanding and the chili very good); then shared a pizza; and the pizzoli (pictured dessert). The pizza was a flat bread which they adjusted toppings to taste. The s'mores (sorry :0 spell check keep changing that to snores...) was warm toasted real melted marshmallows on top of peanut butter and chocolate. It was gooey and rich and sweet -- a real sugar rush -- that definitely should be shared. It would overwhelm one person.  I had a tomato soup that was quite good -- a rich bisque that had the taste and texture of real tomatoes. It was served very hot as asked. The first part of my ""soup and salad"" was a wedge salad. A nice chunk of iceberg covered with bacon bits on top of blue cheese dressing. The standard wedge not outstanding but quite satisfying. No surprises here but would order it again. Hey, what can I say I like iceberg... So overall it's a good place to go when you're not sure what you want to eat -- potstickers to sliders to pizza to... and good for a group cause everyone can get something different.

My fiance ordered a burger and fries with a side of cole slaw. Mind you that we did have to pay extra for the cole slaw ($3.95). I ordered a rack of ribs with a loaded baked potato and asparagus. ALL of the food was EXCELLENT! I mean it was darn good! But then, we were low on drinks. The server came by and asked if we needed refills, we said yes. A long time went by and we had to stop him and ask if we could get a refill. My fiance tasted the cole slaw and it was spicy, which was weird, so we asked the waiter if thats just their cole slaw, which he informed us they have 2 different types, a spicy one and one that is more of a classic cole slaw. He asked the waiter if we could trade the cole slaw, because we didn't know they had 2 kinds, and the waiter said yes. He came back a couple minutes later and set the new cole slaw down and walked away rather quickly. We looked and it was less than half of what we should have recieved. When we saw the waiter again he said ""oh they have to make more so i just gave you what was left"" and walked off like that is ok. What he should have done was said ""Hey, I'm sorry guys they didnt have quite enough would you like to wait and i can bring you out a little more"" that would have been perfectly exceptable. Oh! but it gets better folks! We asked for a manger, the manager comes and we told him everything. I don't typically make a big deal of things like this but $3.95 is a bit much for a small bowl of anything and to not get a full bowl kind of well pardon my language, sucks. So the manger kind of blew us off and acted like his server was justified for bringing us less than half a serving. My fiance asked if it would be acceptable for bringing someone a half a pizza, which the manager actually said ""well.....i dont think so"" OF COURSE NOT! It is so sad that the food at BJ's is AMAZING and I would LOVE to frequent the restaurant, but with the service the way it is, and at more than one location, I will not be back. What this place needs to do is clean house as far as their servers go, or a training camp. It is almost like they are afraid to come out and tell their guests ""hey we dont have what you want, would you like something else, or like to wait while we make it"" Customer service is not that hard to do, and this place could be a lot better with the proper training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40,3.44,3.54,3.54,,3.5000000000000004

We saw tables coming after us and getting their food before us. We took note of it, but we didn't complain. Our attentive waitress told us several times our food was on the way but we continued to wait. Finally a manager came to our table and told us there was a problem in the kitchen. She accepted the fault and then told us our meal was on them for the long wait we experienced. I felt like that was very classy of them to do. They definitely did not have to, but they recognized the problem and made it right. I got the pepperoni pizza flatbread, while my husband got the Parmesan crusted chicken. Both were delicious. I also recommend the peanut butter s'mores pizooki for dessert. You won't be disappointed.

When we got seated I was looking forward to the calamari but when it came out it was cold.  Then it was about 40 minutes for us to receive our entrees.  The server apologized and so did the manager but it wasn't their fault.  You would think that for all of the time spent preparing the food that it would be exception but my burger was below average.  My wife liked her salad which is why the rating is as high as it is.  I can honestly say that quality of the food casted a dark shadow on the great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=20,3.6,3.56,3.56,,3.5760000000000005

1,Jeffrey E.,"Tampa, FL",0,26,3.0,2.0,2017-09-08,"Our experience started with the server apologizing about a wait for our greet time. We waited about 8-10 minutes for a greet which isn't too bad as I've never eaten here before and I was definitely looking through the rather robust menu. Ordered a beer and vanilla cream soda that was drank all the way through the first 5 minutes of getting it. Mind you this was probably an hour experience. We ordered sliders w fries ,avocado egg rolls and Brussels sprouts.  Our server came back once through the entire menu to just drop off our check. No refill no nothing.  Food was very tasty, just the server was bad. She was definitely concentrating on the larger party in her section and we were ignored. Great food, terrible server. Seemed like she was weeded with the 6 tables in her section. No manager table touch... server was a young, red haired server... kudos to the chef, server just needs more training. Saturday 9/8 8:11pm section closest to the entrance.  The other couple next to us would ask for a refill, she would nod her head in acknowledgement and proceed to take order from 5 top with questions. Refill then became less of a priority and guest experience suffer. Next!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park?start=40,3.52,3.56,3.56,,3.5440000000000005

Tried the Apothic Red special glass of wine which was a surprising treat albeit I found it a Publix the next day for $2 less for the bottle versus just a glass.

Pastas are always super tasty and the appetizers are very filling.

Our food was delivered by 3 food runners that, guess what, auctioned off our food!!!  Which of course created some confusion because 2 people weren't exactly sure what they ordered.  So the runners tried harder to auction off the food.  Seriously?  I'm baffled a restaurant of this caliber still auctions off food.  Is this what BJ's expects?  It's disheartening.  We completed our meal, Amanda refilled our drinks as expected, but she left our dirty plates sitting in front of us until she picked up our checks.  She checked on us 3 times after we finished and she left empty handed each time.  When she dropped off our 6 separate checks, of which she didn't auction off and knew exactly where they went, she again left empty handed.  We still had 6 dirty plates we had now pushed towards the center of the table.  When she returned to pick up the checks she took 3 plates with her.  Finally.  But we were done so it was for naught. I suggest you work on not auctioning food and pre-bussing tables.  Had she done this I'd give 4.5 stars.  I'll be back but I'll either sit at the bar or be vocal to the server and request they take the dirty dishes.  I'll probably be upset with more food auctioning so I'll meet the manager that night as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park,3.36,3.49,3.49,,3.438

This place is primarily known in my area for their big menu pizookie's and crispy fries! The menu consists of 25 Pages of food to choose from. I don't know how it's financially possible to have a 25-page menu with those entree's, appetizers and such, but it somehow worked for them. The food came out at least 10 minutes after it was made, which was utterly impressive. The pizookie was like a baked cookie in a pan with lots of ice cream stacked on top. I ate it so swiftly, it took about two minutes for me to finish. However the speed of service was slightly tedious as I was barely finished with my appetizer as soon as the entree came. And the metal taste that came from the pan for the cookie ruined the taste of the cookie by a little bit.  Overall, the speed of the service, and the food was really great. -- I just hope they would slow down before the distribute the food to customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park,3.32,3.49,3.49,,3.422

David later came by to ask how everything was and advised us that he was taking care of the check.  He even offered some dessert at his expense.  All and all this place was very good and the friendliness and customer service was above any place I've ever dined at.  I will definitely be returning in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-citrus-park,3.32,3.49,3.49,,3.422
