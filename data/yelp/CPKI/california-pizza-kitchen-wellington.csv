Chad H.,"Arlington, VA",139,304,601,4.0,11/26/2017,"I usually enjoy my meal at California Pizza Kitchen, and this time was no different. This particular location is inside Wellington Mall. To start out, we shared the Bianco Flatbread which was very good. The combination of gorgonzola and mozzarella cheese went very well together. We first ordered the smashed pea barley soup, but it was a little watery, so we returned it for the sedona tortilla soup. The tortilla soup was thick and delicious, and not too spicy which I appreciate. I ordered the Bahn Mi Bowl for my main dish. Very flavorful with quinoa, chicken, avocado, cucumbers, and more. I liked that they put the chili-lime vinaigrette dressing on the side. The bowl could have has a bit more chicken in it, but nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. If you are super hungry, I recommend something else, but it was good for a lighter dinner.  Service was good for the most part. Took sometime for one of the beverages to come out, but otherwise was fine. When we needed to exchange the barley soup for the sedona tortilla, that was no issue. Waiter was friendly. Overall, I enjoy California Pizza Kitchen and will certainly return to the one by where I live. Nice atmosphere, good food, and positive vibes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington
Valerie R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,6,,5.0,1/2/2018,"This place is absolutely amazing ! No complaints whatsoever. The wait time is almost non existent, the atmosphere is very nice and relaxing. The staff is incredibly kind and very fast. I can not vouch for the pizza as I have not tried it but my favorite dish is the Waldorf Salad. It is unbelievably delicious and I order it every time I go. Very pleased with this restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington
Mark M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",72,45,186,5.0,3/18/2017,"California Pizza Kitchen, Wellington: This restaurant went FAR above my expectations that I had for it, going in. I ate by myself at the bar and chatted with a couple individuals I had just met. Ambiance: Dimly lit, except for in certain areas of seating. At the bar, you get dinner and a show! You can see the two ""pizza chefs"" making the pizzas and putting them into the oven. Food: Being my first time here in awhile, I tried two ""spicy"" menu items. Both of which were amazing. 1st, I ordered the Spicy Cauliflower dish, & 2nd, I ordered the Chipotle Spicy Chicken pizza. The bartender/my server was amazing and her name was Carly. She was attentive and courteous to all her guests(including me). She was on top of whenever I needed a refill on my sweet tea and even gave me one to-go. As an ex-Chick-fil-A employee and hospitality manager after working there for 5 years, I can recognize a reputable and great operation when I see one. California Pizza Kitchen is running on all ""cylinders,"" and looks like they have many pleased guests like myself, as well. I will definitely be returning in the near future to sample some of the other menu items and update this review. I would place this establishment in my top-10 of favorite places to eat, in West Palm Beach/Wellington. Keep up the great work, CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington
Emily T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",525,229,853,4.0,12/1/2016,"Coming to this location of California Pizza Kitchen is always a positive experience! Inexpensive price points, fast service and delicious food is what they strive for. The longest wait I've had for this location is probably 15 mins on a busy night. A few favorites of mine are their baked potato soup and garlic cream fettuccine pasta! Their pastas are portioned perfectly and has the perfect hint of garlic. Pair it with mushrooms and shrimp and it's a hit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington
Pamela F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,441,624,2.0,12/28/2016,"We love CPK so this was a big disappointment after an hour drive from our Lake Worth Airbnb. Service started out great (and why not? we sat at the counter) chatted up the sangria choices until we ordered the sampler and our thai chicken pizza and then, evaporated. It took 30 minutes to get the drink -- and another 45 minutes to get the pizza. We finally broke down and asked if our order had been lost after we burned through the entire sangria sampler and it was nearing 3 p.m. (we arrived at 1:40). Probably the worst service experience at any CPK ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington
Susan B.,"Wellington, FL",19,113,,3.0,6/23/2017,The food and service continue to be excellent but the restaurants is way too loud for any kind of conversation. All fabric has been removed and chairs and booths are mostly hard surfaces with nothing to muffle the noise. The decor is current but not comfortable or suitable for this sized restaurant but the food and service still attract a steady stream of guests.  We will go at 11:00am in the future to avoid the amazingly high noise decibels...noon on Friday was almost unbearable between screaming babies (understandable) and the acoustics or lack thereof.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington
Natalie C.,"Lake Worth, FL",68,94,292,5.0,4/28/2017,"I'm embarrassed to say it but this was a first for me. I had heard of California Pizza for years but had never given them a try. I was at the mall doing some retail therapy when I decided to try it for lunch. It was a weekday and the place was packed like Friday night happy hour. While I contemplated why so many people were not at work, I decided to sit at the bar and browse the menu. To start I had a glass of their delicious orchid sangria. I don't remember what was in it but it sure tasted good. I went with the margherita pizza and was glad I did. The margherita is my test. If you mess up this pizza you shouldn't be in the business. A nice crispy crust, a robust red sauce and real good cheese and fresh basil. California hit the nail on the head. It was really good. Good pizza from a chain restaurant not a mom and pop kinda surprised me... pleasantly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington

Chicken Cobb was served with blue cheese --- not really the right dressing.  Fresh lettuce and veggies to be sure, but the taste was just average.  Chicken Milanese was good, but needed a drizzle of something --- an aoili maybe? Other than that, the arugula was fresh and Parmesan cheese chunks were perfect. Still love CPK, but not thrilled with this visit.

T W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,18,,3.0,5/28/2017,"My wife likes this place for some reason... but after joining her here for a half dozen times... I still don't see the attraction. To me, the food is VERY average, typical chain restaurant fare. The pricing seems to be way high compared to the quality of the meals. I do not mind paying a premium price for genuinely good food... but I hate it when I get a mediocre meal... and then have the bill to be twice what you would expect for that meal. My wife says she likes the place because she can get salad.. or sometimes a decent pasta. Well, maybe there is a small bit of truth to that.... but $40 for a lunch, when the food is average, is way out of bounds for me.

Adam F.,"Jupiter, FL",14,251,,1.0,1/6/2013,"So of course I am with my girl.   I usually do not write reviews on chain restaurants because honestly, what do they care?  They are backed by corporate dollars and probably have no idea what Yelp is. My girl and I go to CPK at The Gardens Mall and it is always consistently good.  Service is great.  Classy atmosphere.  Food is wonderful.  So going to the Wellington one I would've expected the same correct?  Not? Service was very bad.  The food was like from another entirely different restaurant.  I love their waldorf salad when it's done good, like in Gardens.  But Wellington?  Really, it was like I wasn't even at a CPK.  Completely different salad.  Left there hungry.   And looking around the restaurant itself.  Dirty.  Dust and crap on the window sills.  Carpet was just gross.  Overall felt dirty.  Read my review on the mall itself and that should be reason enough not to even come to this CPK, let alone the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=40
Piper D.,"Orlando, FL",1,77,4,1.0,9/7/2013,"No, never mind. This place has gone downhill. It was so bad the last time I went there (last time ever. Won't be going back). The food was awful and it took TWO HOURS from start to finish during weekday LUNCH hour because no one would get us our check.  The manager was flustered and offered a comp and we took it, but it took 5 tries to get us our void check because she kept handing us other people's void checks (because so many other people were getting comps).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=40
Bernard S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",2,88,45,2.0,10/10/2012,"California Pizza Kitchen (or ""CPK"" as they refer to themselves) had a good thing going for a while, being part of that California Cuisine movement in the '90s that brought on creative combinations in a moderately healthy way.  However, times have changed and folks today are less interested in ""fufu pizza"" that comes with a very high price tag and mildly involved servers.  Atmosphere is very corporate, could just as well be a Silicone Valley lunch room.  Soups are very good and salads nice and fresh.  Just beware; a pizza and a drink with some sides and your meal will be up to $50 in no time.

Tiffany T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",137,47,1,4.0,11/5/2010,"I don't understand the first review about creative and good pizza not being mutually exclusive, because in my opinion, they definitely can be! It was a slow Wednesday evening in the mall so there was not a long wait. I've waited for a table here for up to 30 minutes in the past on a Friday or Saturday evening.  I started my meal off with the tortilla soup. It was delicious but I thought it lacked a little bit of vegetables. It was mostly soup. We ordered the carne asada pizza and oh my..our palettes were lit with joy. The pizza was made with a cilantro pesto rather than a red sauce and it was topped with Monterrey Jack, mozzarella cheese, mild green peppers and grilled steak. It was served with a side of tomatillo and roasted tomato salsa. It was delicious. The crust is a amazing. It's thin with a bit of sweetness to it.  The service was great at this location. My waiter forgot my cherry limeade and eventually brought it out but he didn't charge me for it. It was an overall excellent meal. So, if you're looking for creative AND good pizza, definitely check out CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=40

David D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",421,61,6,4.0,5/22/2011,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) was founded in Los Angeles as a less expensive copy of Spago, the original creator of the BBQ chicken pizza. So it is not true to say that it's exactly original, but it's certainly different from most pizza restaurants. With most pizza places, you generally order a large-sized pizza and divvy it up among your table mates.  So if a pizza is $15, that's effectively the price of your meal plus drinks and tip. With CPK, each diner orders a personal pizza, which costs $13-18. So it is much, much more expensive to dine at CPK than typical pizza places. Pizzas are, well, interesting.  There is a standard Italian style pizza on the menu, but that's not why you go to CPK.  You go to CPK for the unique and unusual, such as the BBQ Chicken Pizza or Thai Chicken Pizza.  Basically, the restaurant's creators take a theme like BBQ chicken or Thai and execute it on top of a pizza. In my view, the Thai is the best - you get chicken, cheese and various vegetables on top of a delicious thai peanut sauce. The ingredients are always high quality, but the combination of them and the pizza format can be variable. Sometimes there is such a weight of ingredients on the pizza that the crust cannot properly support it and feels soggy.  Other times, the combination of ingredients was too strange for even my palate, and some people may find the enormous variety of available pizzas difficult to choose from. When you're in the mood for a change in the staid world of pizza, this is a great place to go.  Service is generally excellent and smooth.  And i always enjoy my pizza.  But if you are a pizza traditionalist, by all means take the advice of Anthony V and stay away :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=40

We were seated very quickly but it took a while for our entrees to come out. I ordered the carnitas tacos, they were ok. I really think $10 for two tacos (that only included salsa and chips as a side)were overpriced. The tacos weren't nasty but they didn't blow me away either. My friend ordered the meat cravers pizza. It was delicious. But it wasn't better than any other pizza I've eaten. The service was great though.

Rusten M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",21,104,647,4.0,2/9/2015,"CPK is one of the better chain restaurants.  A little higher priced, but fresh, consistent, and great service. They have amazing salads (large, fresh, unique and tasty) and everything has a fresh, light-handed approach. Many people overlook their spicy/Mexican-flare which is often as-good/better than their specialty pizzas.  Their White-Corn Guacamole is excellent.  Their Tortilla Soup is very good (especially combined with the Potato Leak, as ""Two in a Bowl"").  I believe the Chili Relleno's are new, very tasty. They're also extremely good about sending food back that is not to your liking.  It's a policy for the entire chain, it seems.

Jay Infamous L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",150,493,35,3.0,7/12/2015,"One of the few spots I went to this recent trip in West Palm Beach.  My love for pizza is probably as much as my love for burgers so when trying out California Pizza Kitchen for the first time was somewhat anticipated. Firstly, had the strawberry Mango Cooler which sounded good at first till it arrives. It looked like flavored water...which is what most of it taste like. It is suggested that you stir this drink a little to get some kind of flavor out of it but that helps very little. It tasted like 40% water at the begin, 20% fruit juice in the middle and another 40% water when it gets towards the end of the drink. I should of went with the margarita instead. Now for the pizza: I had the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza, which I wouldn't of minded if I could of gotten it without mushrooms in the first place. The pizza however was good and so was the Ceasar salad that came with it as well but it could of been more filling and as mentioned would of preferred to have the choice of having it just pepperoni and sausage or to at least choose an alternative to the mushrooms. Other than all of that though California Pizza Kitchen is a decent lunch spot to go to with family or I guess during a work break.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20

Mark H.,"Lake Worth, FL",26,142,6,3.0,1/21/2015,"We were tired of papa-johns so tried this place hoping for something a bit healthier and convenient while shopping in the mall.  After eating our pizza I didn't feel sluggish or sick, so I guess it's good in that respect.  My taste buds really weren't that excited about the food though.  We had a cheese and tomato pizza and shared as a family.   The regular pizzas are about $12.00 and you get six slices.  The crust would seem like a thin crust compared to any of the chains, but I was surprised that I got full off of just two slices.  The hostess says most people can't finish their pizzas even though they are only 13"".  I also had a guac and chip appetizer that I got free for signing up from their app and it tasted healthy but not exciting. The best thing about the place was the 1)  the peaceful surroundings - the music is not loud and the people are quiet. 2) they make it a point to pay particular attention to people with food allergies and make sure you don't get sick 3) the employees and waitstaff are very friendly and attentive. -very relaxed and were nice to our little kids who can be bratty very frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
Mike B.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",148,4,2,5.0,2/16/2016,"Excellent service by Hillary! Great food and atmosphere, they even made a dish for me that wasn't even on the menu anymore. Chicken Caesar Sandwich with sedona tortilla soup. If you go sit near the bar and request Hillary great personality and very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
Jamie K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",26,77,,4.0,6/15/2015,"It was a shopping girl's day but before diving in heels first to the good stuff, we had to fill our bellies and regain energy. We figured California Pizza Kitchen had a little bit of everything for everyone. Our server was very sweet when she came to the table for our drink orders, everyone was drinking wine or beer (because what else do you do in the middle of the day on Saturday?) and it was a fresh strawberry mango cooler for me (preggo here.) Our server brought over bread and was very patient as we chatted away without looking at the menu for a good 20 minutes. What I really appreciated though, was she happened to notice that I wasn't quite downing my drink; while refreshing and very delicious it was a little too sweet for even my liking. Shocking I know. After finally stopping to look at the menu, we all ordered, my girlfriend's had the Tuscan hummus and the chicken flatbread and I was still undecided by the time she got to me. I asked for recommendations and settled on the vegetable salad which came highly recommended.  Because we went back to talking without missing a breath, I didn't notice whether the food wait was long or short, but alas it was time to eat. I know for sure one of my girlfriend's loved her flatbread because it was almost gone before we left, my other friend enjoyed her hummus and commented on how much she liked the pita that it came with and she appreciated the freshness of the vegetables. My salad, wowzers; I was talking about that thing even the next day it was that good. It had every fresh vegetable you can imagine: roasted eggplant, avocado, tomatoes, red and yellow peppers, roasted corn and sun dried tomatoes all over romaine lettuce and tossed with a light, and very mildly sweet Dijon balsamic vinaigrette. I also threw some grilled chicken in for a little protein. Honestly, my husband and I had stopped going to CPK because they took our favorite pizza off the menu - this salad would make me go back. It was really delicious and loaded with vegetables that were all very fresh, I just enjoyed that every bite I took had a different flavor. If you are a salad lover, go for this one for sure.  We didn't save any room for dessert this day because we had a shopping mission to accomplish, but it was definitely a good choice for everyone and I will now be back to CPK in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
David K.,"Lake Worth, FL",107,116,173,4.0,5/6/2014,"I'm a creature of habit here. The BBQ chicken pizza is my go to order at this place. It is always good and there are times that I just crave it. This location was recently remodeled and it has a more open feel. Some hi-top tables are a nice addition. Although often busy with a wait, they handle the crowd with skill and get folks in and out swiftly. My kids LOVE their mac and cheese and I have to admit, I've stolen a bit or two and its pretty good as well. When the food court just won't do, give CPK a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
Jessica H.,"Boynton Beach, FL",34,24,13,3.0,12/1/2015,"My boyfriend and I went here yesterday for lunch. It was both of our first times. We waited to be seated for over 5 minutes and no one said anything. Finally, we sat down and waited another 15 minutes for simple drinks. We both got the lunch combos. My boyfriend loved his sandwich & salad. My soup and salad was pretty tasty too. The service was pretty bad so luckily the food was good. We want to try dinner and dessert sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
Michelle M.,"Wellington, FL",48,235,332,2.0,7/18/2012,"I love pizza, so I really looked forward to eating here, but I was just disappointed. There are good chains, and I think CPK is overpriced and the atmosphere seemed cold and unwelcoming.  The prices were absolutely outrageous to me. $13 for what is about the size of a personal pan pizza? Yes, I get that they put on fancy toppings and it is a bit more substantial than your normal pizza place, but come on! My husband and I shared a meat cravers pizza, and I found it nothing more than average. The spinach dip was merely okay. Their beer prices, also ridiculous.  Selection wise, I give them an A++. They have a million different combinations of pizza, as well as pasta and salads. The prices just took away from any enjoyment I may have had eating.  There are so many good, local, low priced pizza joints out there, try them and not here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20

Debbie S.,"North Palm Beach, FL",606,18,32,5.0,3/14/2015,"Hey, it's California Pizza Kitchen!  But tonight was exceptional.  We had fun with the hostess, the waiter was terrific, food was hot, fresh and quick and most impressive was the manager.  We observed as he expedited, worked with wait staff, interacted with customers, worked with kitchen staff and even found time to plug my phone in for me.  You could see the entire place was working FOR him and WITH him.  Great job, crew!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
Mark H.,"Wellington, FL",2,24,3,4.0,10/20/2014,"Consistently good although I think I prefer the place before the renovation overhaul. Service is outstanding and friendly. Not a typical pizza joint, but never a disappointment. Menu highlights are; Tostada Lime Chicken Pizza, 5 Cheese and tomato pizza, southwest soup, foccacia bread, hummus dip, BBQ chicken pizza, and salted Carmel pudding. An outdoor dining area is forthcoming so I told. Located at the back of the mall near Dillard's. One of my favorite places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
Alissa B.,"Lake Worth, FL",15,73,9,3.0,1/11/2015,"They have renovated this place since I was first here.  It is definitely nicer looking now than before.  Unfortunately, I feel that the food was better before.  It had been quite awhile since I had been here and we figured we would go since we were at the mall.  The kids meals are a good size.  I have tried the BBQ chicken pizza and oriental chicken salad which were my favorites in the past, and although they claim that the chicken is fresh it has a refrigerated taste.  The best thing I've had recently was a bite of my daughter's mac and cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
Will G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",14,17,3,4.0,8/7/2014,So close to a five star.  We like this place.  Good service and good food.  The location in the Wellington mall is very convenient.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20
