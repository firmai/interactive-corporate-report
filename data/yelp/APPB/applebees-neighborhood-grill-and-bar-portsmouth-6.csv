Barbara F.,"West Portsmouth, OH",1,43,3,4.0,12/31/2016,"We had dinner there this evening. The service was excellent. My boyfriend had the enchiladas verdes, I had the 6 oz. sirloin. Both meals were good, not exceptional; however, they exceeded our expectations for a chain like Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-6
Justin W.,"Portsmouth, OH",7,6,,3.0,3/31/2017,"The menu and the quality of the food is much better, but average, at best.  The service has been good, recently.  I don't ""avoid it like the plague,"" any longer; I just go other places unless it's late at night and Applebee's is the only restaurant open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-6
Jason H.,"Chesapeake, OH",0,11,7,1.0,6/19/2016,"If I could give less than one star, I would. Sat down with my son. Ordered two waters, an order of wings and fiesta lime chicken. In about 15 minutes, his wings came out. Even though I had to rob silverware from a neighboring table, nothing too bad happened as of yet. I sat in my booth for 47 minutes and my chicken never came. I went to the front and found the hostess that seated us. I asked to see a manager, a manager never came. The hostess came and offered to make my chicken right away. I politely declined. They brought my chicken anyway. The hostess, still not the manager, said that the chicken was 'on the house'. Thanks for the favor. I'm not touching the chicken. It can sit there. I didn't have super high expectations. I understand I'm at applebees. However, this is absolutely the worst Applebees I've ever been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-6
Lindsey H.,"West Portsmouth, OH",0,4,,1.0,12/20/2014,"Don't bother. Apparently the reason that the service is consistently horrible is because they can't keep employees long enough because they are constantly begging for help on indeed. Food is edible (sometimes), but overpriced. Employees have no idea what they're doing (at least the ones I've come into contact with). Go somewhere else... you won't be sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-6
Michael B.,"Winfield, WV",7,43,150,5.0,5/12/2013,"Busy, busy, busy Mothers Day and they still made our visit perfect. Thanks for the awesome memories. Great food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-6
Mark R.,"Wheelersburg, OH",0,87,19,2.0,8/15/2010,"I keep hoping!  I have been to this restaurant on numerous occasions. I keep thinking they will eventually get it right.  Unfortunately, the last visit was an added disappointment.  In the past the food was okay but the service has been sub-par especially the speed of the kitchen.  The last visit the service was superb, yet the food was awful.  The spinach and artichoke appetizer was all right and the beer was very cold and thirst quenching (on a hot, humid night), but the steaks for our meals were not worthy.  We ordered both medium;  one came well-done and the other one raw.  Neither of us finished our meals. I'm not sure I will return.  How many chances can you give one restaurant  (even though it is located in a very convenient location)?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-6
Roxanne M.,"Slidell, LA",0,5,,2.0,1/13/2012,"I'm a  fan of Applebee's but this one in Portsmouth is ""meh"". I will say that the staff has always been friendly and efficient but the kitchen staff is another story.  The food is sometimes okay but you never know when you''ll receive it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-portsmouth-6
