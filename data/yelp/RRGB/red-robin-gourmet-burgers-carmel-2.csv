Abunaser F.,"Broken Arrow, OK",13,14,2,4.0,1/5/2018,Red Robin is one of my favorite chain gourmet burger places. Place was relatively quiet tonight. Their strawberry lemonade with real fresh strawberries was very good.  I ordered their tavern taco burger. Juicy and tasty. Large steak fries are always good. Our server was very helpful with her multiple checking on us. Good experience overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2
Paul K.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,866,16,2.0,10/5/2017,"Chain restaurant, but this particular location kind of sucked. It started off good, but went down hill when the food came. I order a side of chili for the fries, which was cold and kind of nasty. Also, the order comes with a skimpy side of fries. Now, supposedly they have ""bottomless"" fries, but the server never showed up again after we ordered so no one ever offered us any.  The wife decided to order dessert on the electronic menu they have on the table. When it finally comes, the guy makes no effort to take the dirty meal dishes- instead, he kind of pushes them aside. We ask for silverware- since there were no spoons- and when he comes back I try to hand him my dirty dish and he makes a BLine and ignores us. We paid on the electronic terminal and left, the burger was good but the rest of the meal was unpleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2
Nicole S.,"Indianapolis, IN",239,711,2588,3.0,9/13/2017,"Sigh. I kind of have to like Red Robin because they cater to families, and they know what families want. What we want are kids menus aimed at pre-readers with pictures of the food, so kids can point at what they want. We also want games and entertainment at the table so the kids will just be QUIET for ONE SINGLE MINUTE while the adults eat in peace. We also want kid-sized beverages. We also want quick service, so we can eat and get the heck out before someone has a meltdown. Red Robin has all these things and does all these things well, so it's a good place for families. The food is just OK. It's what you'd expect from a chain burger place. At this particular restaurant, there were tiny flies at our table that would not go away no matter how many times I swatted at them. That was a bummer, especially because they kept hanging around our food and my beer.  One nice touch is that when I ordered a kids hamburger with an extra plate (to split between two young kids), they automatically cut the burger in half without me having to ask. They also split up the fruit into separate cups. Nice! This is what I mean about it being family friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2
Stephanie B.,"Columbus, IN",47,75,44,5.0,12/18/2017,We had to wait for about 20 minutes for our table. Not bad for a busy Saturday night! Our waitress was very nice and got our order right away! I had the guacamole bacon burger. It was cooked perfectly and delicious! Soooooo good! I had the onion rings instead of fries. They were perfect!! I wanted to eat a whole basket!! I wish we had a Red Robin where we live bc this place is great!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2
Mary C.,"South Pasadena, CA",85,86,60,4.0,1/3/2018,"The new veggie burger option at Red Robin is soooo good!!! The flavors really compliment each other, and it's not bland, nor does it try to be a ""fake"" burger. It's just delicious! I splurged when I came to this location, and got the fries, which are worth the splurge. Since I've cleaned up my eating, my fried food intake has gone down significantly, but on a rare occasion, I will indulge. I don't regret this indulgence. I also enjoy RR's unsweetened iced tea, because it's not weak, like a lot of iced tea is at chain restaurants. Our server that night was a really cool guy, and I'm bummed that I blanked on his name, because he deserves a shout-out, for being knowledgeable about the menu, personable, and displayed impressive patience while having to deal with my dad! In a really cool ending to the night, as we walked out of Red Robin, we were able to get a glimpse of the Supermoon from the parking lot, which was awe-inspiring, and a nice end to a meal, and a trip to the Midwest!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2

Kelsey T.,"Chicago, IL",264,139,185,3.0,5/6/2017,"Red Robin had your fairly standard chain restaurant feel with a fairly loud environment and overall busy dining feel. The staff was very friendly and the burger menu is quite large with a wide variety of options which is great. The quality is decent, nothing super fancy by any means but also definitely no complaints. Very much your standard American burger joint feel. I would recommend the a1 peppercorn burger or the crispy chicken salad if you do come! Great outdoor shopping area right around this location as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2
Alexis K.,"Bloomington, IN",123,14,1,2.0,12/31/2017,"Last Thursday was one of the most horrible experiences at Red Robin I've ever had and I would hope they would work to correct it. I called and made a to-go order at 5:15. They said it will about 15 minutes, so I took a little extra time and got gas and arrived about 5:45. I go to the bar (where they previously had you pickup to go orders) and a host standing talking to the bartender said if I went to the host stand she would assist me. So, assuming since someone acknowledged they WOULD help me, I walk over to the to go stand at the front and Wait. A manager, I believe, in glasses and had brown hair, and another young man seating guests and adding people to the wait list said to me numerous times, ""Have you been helped?"" And I said each time, ""Kind of. I'm waiting on a to-go order."" They just said ""okay"" and continued to help those who walked in the door. So it's now 6:15, 30 minutes after I arrived, and no one has acknowledged me or helped me with my order despite my many attempts to get assistance. What did get their attention finally at 6:30ish was that SOMEONE ELSE came in for their to go order and got theirs from that same manager lady, and had to tell her that I had been waiting long before she arrived. Then that manager looks at me after a few minutes of seating more people and says, ""excuse me, are you still waiting to be sat?"" And I'm livid at this point. I tell her no I am waiting for an order I placed AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES ago that they informed me would take 15 minutes. She apologizes, goes back and grabs a bag that's been sitting their pretty much the entire time I've been there, and tells me it's on her. So yay, free food. But it's cold. Burger, cold. Fries, cold. The only reason I'm giving more than one star is because she didn't make me pay for the meals I ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2
Robert B.,"Houston, TX",42,419,809,3.0,7/8/2016,"So I have been to Red Robins all over.  This location is really nice.  Not too busy on a early Friday.  Service was really good.  Always is when you're at bar seating.  I don't know why, but the Coke they serve is a little bit funky. I assume it's because the nozzle on the soda gun  at the bar doesn't get cleared as often as it should...? So today I tried a new burger.  The peppercorn A1 burger.  The peppercorn was a bit overwhelming IMO. The burger in general is always ehhh. I guess because it's such a big chain the burger will always be over done.  Bottomless fries are always a plus. Especially when they are the steak cut fries.  Obviously not the best burger ever. But it's a consistent chain.  Nevertheless the service at this location was prompt and friendly. Never had to ask for a refill on my funky Coke or my bottomless fries. I would certainly go back just for the service. The A1 peppercorn burger on the other hand I'll steer away from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2
Bryndon P.,"Carmel, IN",165,37,,5.0,2/3/2017,"I enjoy Red Robin, it's one of the few places that my wife can find gluten free fries. The burgers are usually really good too. We came to eat tonight and were greeted by Nick our server who was friendly and very attentive to the details of our order. I asked for their D.G.B. Burger, but I wanted to add the candied bacon they were featuring on other burgers to the D.G.B. burger I had chosen. Nick expressed his love of the candied bacon and thought this would be a great flavor combo. The food came out in a reasonable time for a busy Saturday night, but I quickly discovered that the bacon on my burger was not the candied bacon I had ordered but regular bacon. I alerted our server who sincerely apologized and made sure to notify the manager and get the right bacon to me. Nick is a big fan of the candied bacon and he loved my idea to add it to the D.G.B. Burger so he not only added it on the order but typed a separate message tot the kitchen to make sure it came out right, so he was disappointed that it hadn't come out the way he had sent it back to the kitchen. The bacon came out quickly along with the manager who apologized and discounted the meal. I added the candied bacon to the burger and OMG!!! The flavors together were incredible! This is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten, and I've been fortunate to eat at many excellent restaurants in my life. This burger was amazing. I was really impressed with the service, and I realize that not every experience at a restaurant, especially on a busy Saturday is going to be perfect, but I'm always impressed when the staff and management are quick to correct the problem with a positive attitude. Paul Foreman the manager, and Nick the server took great care of us, and we had a wonderful meal. My only regret was not waiting to get the candied bacon so I could eat the entire burger with those amazing sweet and savory flavors together. It was SO GOOD :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2

Christina D.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,22,3,1.0,6/6/2017,We asked our two year what she wanted to eat for dinner and she said French fries so we decided to go to Red Robin for bottomless fries and had burgers as well. We haven't been to Red Robin in ages and I can tell you we will never go back. The service was absolutely terrible and the food was cold. Burgers are the same as McDonalds and it took 20 minutes to get my daughters apple juice and almost 30 minutes to get napkins for the table after we asked at least 5 times. There were so many servers just standing around doing nothing. We will never be back. Sorry. Terrible experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2

Cilleain G.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,,2.0,5/13/2016,"The only reason for the second star goes specifically to the manager on duty, who was quick in her response to my complaint and took appropriate measures to try and fix our dissatisfaction. As for the rest of our experience, BLAH! Tonight after a twelve hour work day I brought my two young sons in as a treat. When we walked in the door there were five employees at the hostess stand, joking with each other. No one paid us attention for about two minutes. I shrugged it off as it is just after dinner rush on a Friday and they are probably just glad they survived. We were seated and given menus. Our waitress promptly took our drink and meal orders.  It then took about fifteen minutes for my kids to get their chocolate milk and orange juice, then another five for me to receive my diet soda, which arrived two minutes before my food. My kids of course sucked down their drinks and my five year old asked for another Orange Juice.  We did not receive his orange juice until the entire meal was finished and my other son had his food boxes up. I had to ask for a water for him so he at least had something to drink AFTER he was done his food. The waitress finally brought the drink and I requested a to go cup since we had been ready to leave for a bit and she told us to ""just take the cup, no one would care"" as a manager of a business, I was aghast. That is theft. I told her to just bring me a to go cup. She did. It was then fifteen minutes later, and she went past my table multiple times but never brought the check. Another employee had to stop when I asked so I could speak to the manager. By this time my kids are bored out of their minds and starting to act up, because really? It took forever.

Abby Z.,"Noblesville, IN",2,58,17,2.0,11/26/2014,I think I've finally given up on this place. We've gotten terrible service the last two visits. We went for dinner at 8pm on a Tuesday night. The hostess was nowhere to be found and we waited to be seated for several minutes. We were sat in the bar and had to wait for the bartender to make several tables drinks before she came over to get our drinks. Once we finally ordered we waited forever for our food. My burger was undercooked and my fiancés chicken was sitting on a small bed of wet and wilted lettuce.    After receiving our food no one ever came back to the table until a check was dropped off!

I have ordered take-out many times from this location, and I have always been extremely pleased with the service.  My order is taken by a polite, attentive employee who always asks all the right questions so there will be no surprises: how we would like each burger cooked, regular or garlic cheese fries, etc.) The take-out orders are packed VERY nicely, condiments and plastic utensils are packed separately in a nice bag.  No spills, no crushed food, nothing is ever left out.  The food is always very fresh, hot, and excellent.  The containers are stacked into nice bags that are convenient to carry as well as sturdy. This visit was no exception.  I was greeted when I arrived to pick up my order, and I paid for it at the bar.  Excellent food, excellent service....will return again soon for take-out. Now, dining inside is another story, which is why we carry-out so often.  Some of our dining experiences here have been great....great food, attentive, cheerful, enthusiastic service.  But other experiences have been awful......wrong food items served, slow service, seldom having our server return to refill drinks, etc.  On a few visits we have received an embarrassingly small portion of ""bottomless fries"" served with our food, and then we never see our server again to request more fries or drink refills. One server here is terrific....we always hope to be seated in her section.  Once we had a terrible server but our favorite server was taking excellent care of the large group at the table next to us.  Her entire group was receiving enthusiastic, cheerful service and our server was nowhere to be found for drink refills, dessert orders, etc, and there were only three of us, not a large group.  The differences between servers were just striking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=20

About 10 mins later cuz they had sat two couple before us, they called the other ppls name. I went up and asked them why they weren't calling our name because we had been there first and I put my name down. Well apparently they didn't put my name down (as if we were sitting in their waiting room for no reason) and they apologized and said we were next. I was pretty mad at this point. Clearly we were there first. We were the only ones waiting at first. They clearly just ignored us and didn't care at all.  So after waiting like 30 mins to get a table we sat there for 10 mins waiting to be greeted.

Jon L.,"West Lafayette, IN",0,6,,1.0,3/22/2015,"Stopped in here during a house hunting trip on a Saturday just after 1PM. The place looked pretty busy, but there was no one ahead of us waiting so we were pretty hopeful we could eat and get going to our next showing. We waited around 15 minutes for a table of 6, needing 2 high chairs for our younger children. After being seated we quickly made our choices so we would be ready when our server arrived. After about 15 minutes the table next to us had paid and left and around 4 or 5 servers had passed our table without even looking in our direction. Way to go team!! That is when we noticed the table across from us all had empty drinks and their menus still on the table in front of them.  We now had about an hour an 15 minutes to make it to our next showing and had not even placed our drink order. We gathered our things and left. The manager chased us down outside and apologized and offered to pay for our lunch if we came back, but we did not have time. She then offered to comp us a dinner if we came back at a later date. Doubt we will be back, with a family of 6 we cannot afford to waste our time even when we are not on a tight schedule.  Ended up eating lunch at Wendy's with four VERY unhappy children.  Normally we have really good service and food at this chain, I will consider it to be just this location and treat the kids to the one in Carmel the next time we are in Indianapolis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=20

Melissa G.,"Chicago, IL",56,3,,1.0,4/30/2016,"Very disappointed in this Red Robin! My 7 year old daughter wanted to come for her birthday dinner after we left the museum with her two best friends. We are very familiar with Red Robin and how they work since I have worked for them. When we arrived, I told the host that it was her birthday and I would like them to sing, at the end of the cold meal I let my waitress know as well. After waiting  and waiting no one ever came, we were three hours from home and had to get on the road so we left with no birthday song for my daughter from her favorite restaurant!! Glad to be back near the Mishawaka store!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=20
Dennis R.,"Gas City, IN",141,170,179,3.0,10/22/2013,"Stopped for lunch.  Service was good.  I ordered a burger with a fried egg...it was a total mess!  There was too much mayo and the burger was just o.k..  It slipped and slid all over the bun, finally attacked it with a knife and fork.  Fries were mediocre.  There was nothing great and nothing horrible.  Hence the middle of the road review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=20
Taylor F.,"Albuquerque, NM",74,190,41,5.0,7/21/2013,"****GLUTEN FREE***** I must say that even though the world is starting to recognize that they need to offer more gluten free options, there still remain few that you can rely on to actually get it right.  What's awesome is that they pay special attention to this fact when you ask for something gluten free. We often order Red Robin to go and get the burger as a lettuce wrap. In one of our first experiences the bartender actually proactively said, ""We'll make the french fries gluten free for you as well."" We knew ahead of time that the seasoning had gluten or traces of gluten in it, but for him to actually know his menu so well and anticipate our needs blew me away.  It is a shame that more restaurants couldn't learn from this restaurant as they are best practice in service and specialty service to their gluten free guests! Thank you Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=20
Melissa B.,"Carmel, IN",0,4,,2.0,4/18/2015,"Usually I have a pretty good time at Red Robin with my family but last night we went around 5 pm and the conditions of the restaurant were really bad.  The table we were seated at was horribly sticky like it had been cleaned with dirty dish water.  When I took my 5 year old to the bathroom, it was the same thing. The floor was incredibly sticky.  The bathroom was really dirty.  The temperature inside the restaurant was sweltering.  It was beautiful outside they should have opened the door and let the fresh air in or turned on the AC.    The service and the food were good.  It was just the conditions in the restaurant that were poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=40
Jay G.,"Carmel, IN",0,4,,1.0,3/2/2016,"I went here for lunch with two other girlfriends and our kids.  We told the waitress from the beginning that we were in a hurry, I personally had a dentist appointment at 12:30pm and it was 11:10am when we walked into the restaurant.  The waitress was not friendly at all with us.  Personally she seemed unhappy to be serving a table with kids, even though all of our kids were seated and not talking loudly.  We had to repeatedly ask for basic service (ex. napkins and utensils when our food arrived, refills on drinks etc).  She sighed and made it seem like she was doing us a favor helping us out.  Our food took so long to be ready - we didn't get our food until 12:05 which at that point I had to ask her to just put my orders in a to go box since we needed to leave the restaurant by 12:10.    This was the worse service I have ever received in a long time.  The most annoying part is we do not eat out often due to costs and it is sad that we spent one of our few treats of eating out eating out of togo boxes and getting bad service.  I have not gone back to this Red Robin and do not plan on going back. Note, I meant to put this review in when we actually went - 8/10/15.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=40
Nolando T.,"San Diego, CA",263,381,137,4.0,9/10/2014,"This chain is one of my favorites. The food is consistently good. Not incredible, but definitely above average. Basically, regardless of the location you know what you're getting. I came in about 30 minutes before closing. All the staff was friendly and I didn't get the sense that they were trying to hurry me up so they could go home. They took my order and it came out pretty quick and it tasted just right. The server checked on me regularly and I had no issues. My only gripe is they got rid of my favorite burger. The 5 Alarm Burger! Bring it back! Puhleeeeeease! Ok, tantrum over. So in conclusion, this is a decent Red Robin...go there. And tell them to bring back the 5 Alarm Burger. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=40

My granddaughter asked for some more fries while we we waiting and the server said there wasn't any ready. Really?? I can't imagine how long we would of waited if the place had been full.

Richard H.,"Indianapolis, IN",66,643,12,1.0,7/22/2013,"Ugh.  First of all, it really caters to families, so there are tons of kids here -- most of them, from the looks of it, under 10. They have a wide selection of burgers, sandwiches and wraps.  The burgers come with various elaborate toppings.  I got the gourmet cheeseburger, and it was pretty tasteless and unexciting.  I am sure the burgers with all the toppings are much more adventurous, but it all comes down to the burger, right?  And this one did not measure up.  Go across the street to Ted's Montana Grill.

Marcie M.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",435,519,29,4.0,7/20/2010,"This place rocks.  I am obviously not a chain fan (if you read some of my other reviews) but Red Robin is glorious!  I am not a big ""burger"" fan either but when i'm in the mood, I do feel RR is a great choice!  From their classic burger to their spicy jalepeno option, I am always very happy with the food.  However, if you are in the mood for guacemole or chicken, they have that covered too, which I appreciate! My current favorites on the menu are the onion ring tower (not that I really need that!) with their spicy dipping sauce and their flamin' hot wings.  YUUUUUMMMMM. :)  But most importantly to me now is that they are EXTREMELY family/baby-friendly and always are so sweet to my son when we come in.  I think every single person who worked there stopped by our table to ooh and awww over him and there were tons of other kiddos in the restaurant.  I don't know why they chose him, but it made him happy and made the meal that much more enjoyable. I really love the staff at this location.  We have never had bad service and our meals have always been up to par and better than all other chains.   I am very pleased that the RR is so close to our apartment and will miss it when we move in two weeks.   I do not recommend RR as a good date location unless you sit in the bar...it is just much too family-oriented for that, but if you are looking for a fun place with consistently good food for a group or outing with friends, I think this is a fantastic choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=40

I recently had their loaded baked potato soup, very good. Every time I go I order a root beer float and they're always good. Their new thing is the smokehouse burger which has mushrooms, garlic and fried onion strings on it. It was delish! But boy did I need a breath mint after wards. That was one of the best burgers I've ever had, nice and tender. My friends had an appetizer sampler that had fried zuccinni in it. I tried it and it was very good. I'll probably order it next time.

Betsy A.,"Indianapolis, IN",33,314,283,2.0,8/11/2008,"I'll begin by saying that my first visit to this Red Robin, shortly after its opening, would have garnered more than two stars. On that occasion, our server was attentive and enthusiastic and the food that arrived at our table looked and tasted exactly as was anticipated. Fast forward to my most recent Red Robin outing....this time for a carryout order. When we arrived, we could see our goods sitting on the bar counter, which is the designated area for all carryout orders at RR. However, the bartender was so occupied, we waited several minutes to pay, despite there appearing to be more than a few hostesses and other staff who may have been able to assist us? Then again, maybe they're not allowed to take that sort of initiative, a la Trader Joe's (there, staffers open another checkout lane when they spy more than one customer waiting to pay for their goodies). As for my order, the burger was cooked just fine and had all the right ingredients. Unfortunately, it was overloaded with mayo that only served to wilt the lettuce and make the bun soggy. I wanted to taste the teriyaki and pineapple in my Banzai Burger, but all I got was a mouthful of mayo. Scraping the mayo off helped, but I lost my lettuce in the process. And, by that time the bun was more like a pancake from all the goo. The fries and vanilla malt were excellent and I've no complaints in that area. I will definitely try RR again in the future and hope for a better experience next time. Not being a big consumer of hamburgers, I'll chalk this one up to bad timing - a Sunday afternoon when the dining room was wall-to-wall with families out for a bite on a beautiful day.  Word to the wise here: if you don't like your burgers smothered with the saucy type ingredients, you might want to request ""light"" or on the side condiments.  On a positive note: this is a great place to take kids - most will love the food and beverage menu (great twists on lemonade), along with the bright, bustling atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=40
