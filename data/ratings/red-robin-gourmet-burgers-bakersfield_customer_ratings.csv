It tasted so good that while we were driving home from LA and got hungry I decided that we just had to stop by and get another. It was that good.  I called in the order while we were a few miles out and when we got there just as it was finished. The girls at the counter we very nice and helpful. When we got back into the car and I started tearing down I was really very sad. It still tasted the same but didn't at the same time. The big difference was that the veggies in this wrap were somehow soggy, where as the last time I had it they were fresh and crunchy. I was also missing the coleslaw that it came with. Something I really didn't want to find out as we were driving home which was nearly 2 hours away. I didn't want to have to turn around for my order to be right, so I dealt with it.

We're both young so it's okay, but I would definitely not come here at age 30+ and with a slower metabolism. It's like a heart attack on a plate. I always get the same thing: Royal Red Robin burger. The great thing about ordering burgers here is that they have unlimited fries. Not the skinny fries you see at McDonald's. These babies are huge slices of potato, fried to perfection. We also ordered Freckled Lemonade, which you get unlimited refills of as well. I love fishing out the syrupy strawberry bits. Since I eat clean, healthy food 95% of the time, it feels good to indulge in greasy, unhealthy food once in a while.

My bf and i were greeted by a nice hostess katilyn, who lead us to our seats. We eagerly looked over the menu. Thus is when the disappoint started it took the waitress at least if not more five minutes to come to our table. She did not apologize for the wait and she didn't greet us with her name. She proceeded to ask if we looked over the menu and what would we like. Irritated I asked for water and peach tea as my bf asked for lemonade. We also placed an appetizer order. She dropped off our drinks and didn't return for another ten to 15 minutes to get our entree order. After waiting for what seemed like forever our food arrived. The food was just OK nothing special ( we got the red royal robin). I do have to say the server did improve on refilling our drinks on a timely manner. We did not find out the servers name until the bill came.. Natalie! My bf is a manager at a restaurant and I am a server. When we go out we except great service because that is what we provide not to mention we are a paying customer service should be already good. If red robin wants to improve the managers nd servers shouldn't hide behind the fact it was a lunch rush. Even if the restaurant is full/busy the customers deserve good service. Train your servers on greet times and proper greetings. Also teach them how to check up on the status of the table.

113,Abby T.,"El Monte, CA",4,16,4.0,2.0,2014-04-03,"I really want to give them ONE STAR.  I'm from LA, so we thought having Red Robin for a late lunch while in Bakersfield wouldn't be much different from the ones we usually go to. At first glance, you can see nearly all the servers are very young (even the janitorial staff). Different from what I'm used to, but I didn't want that to affect my experience. It was until we had to flag them down that I noticed how irritable it was. They had an excuse for EVERYTHING. ""Oh, there's trash on this table. I'm sorry! Let me clean it before you sit. I can't believe no one did it beforehand."" ""No more ketchup? I just hate it when no one replaces it, don't you?"" Look, I don't care if everything wasn't 1OO% prepared, so I don't need you trying to strike a conversation about how others aren't working. You weren't prepared, fine. But apologize for yourself and stop placing the blame elsewhere. I guess the servers are so young that they're so fixated on getting a gold star on every single thing they do. Anyways, food was good. (Although, my server had tried to question me on my order. I KNOW what kind of bread I want, so stop trying to get me to choose another bread!) Skimpy on the fries really, but not really a complaint when they're bottomless. Servers are always chatting in the grilling area, talking about their friends, lives, and jobs. Things you shouldn't be mentioning, let alone yelling about, while working. For the service alone, I will never come back.

She looked as if I interrupted her from a deep thought and said ""You can sit anywhere you like."", and smiled. So I did seat myself strangely at a booth near the end.

I was contacted less than 24 hours after my last review on yelp. The first initial contact was from out of town perhaps corporate and was through a message on Yelp. My second contact was a personal phone call from a local manager. I was given a heartfelt apology and a gift card to comeback and try them again.  I returned gift card in tow and am happy to say that I was much more satisfied with the quality ( temperature) of my food. My waitress was very nice and helped me sign up for the rewards program they offer ( very cool) which gave me a free hamburger of my choice during my birthday month! My only major complaint is that every visit it's seems to be a chore to get refills on drinks or sides of sauces once I receive my meal. Maybe understaffed?

It's unsafe, there are too many people, etc.  But I go there for Red Robin.  The other star was taken off for the service I received. I sat down with no napkins or utensils at my table.  I ordered the riblets, so I think I would need some napkins.  My party received our food quickly, so fast that we didn't have our drinks yet.  They were specialty drinks, but still, drinks should come with the food at least. The food was great though.  Red Robin always has good food going for it at the right price.  So that is always a bonus when I go.  I have no complaints about that. Now the bill came and was $10 more than expected.  I ordered a root beer float for my drink and my friend ordered some purple non-alcoholic drink.  My root beer float was advertised as bottomless, and my friends drink was on the same page as the other bottomless drinks.  However, we were charged each time we received a refill.  The worst part is that the waiter didn't even know the specialty drink my friend ordered!  We disputed the bill and they said my root beer float was bottomless, but the other drink was not.  When we were leaving we checked the menu, and sure enough, it was on the same page as the other drinks that were bottomless.  So they lost a star for that. My recommendation is that you thoroughly check your bill before you pay.  However, the food is decent enough to deal with that headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=120,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8280000000000003,3.1600000000000006

We ordered our drinks along with our daughters dinner so she wouldn't go berserk, we then ordered our meals a few minutes. We ordered the grilled chick on a stick for our daughter, my wife ordered the bacon guacamole burger, and I ordered the tried and true Royal burger. My wife asked for her burger medium rare and I asked for the egg on my burger to be over medium. I also asked for the garlic fries (shame on you red robin. I'll touch on this in a bit) Our food arrived shortly after. So much for ordering our daughters food ahead of ours. My daughters chicken was not even luke warm, my wife's burger had almost no guacamole and the egg on my burger looked like it had been microwaved. And my ""garlic fries""....seriously you guys? How many corners are you going to cut now? The fries simply had garlic powder sprinkled on them. What happen to the old Red Robin? Year after year you guys cut more and more corners. How the hell were you ranked one of the best burgers? The quality of the meat has simply tanked over the years.  I waited several minutes for our server to pop back up. When I drew his attention to the egg on my burger he seemed to have no idea what the problem was. I expressed that I ordered the egg over medium and it looks like it has been sitting under the heat lamp all night and over cooked the egg. He asked if I would like another egg. I said sure that fine, knowing by the time the new egg came out the burger would be cold.  While waiting for the new egg I noticed almost all of his tables were having issues. The table directly behind us complained of mayonnaise on her burger after she requested no mayo. He was very quick to apologize and offer to make her a hole new burger. At that point my jaw just dropped. I'm sitting here waiting for an egg and she gets a new burger because of mayo(I get it, they can't just wipe the mayo off). Few more minutes goes by and a woman comes from the kitchen dragging her feet across the floor the entire way to our table and ask who ordered the side egg. This new egg was crispy to all hell and also almost over cooked, at least there was a little bit of a yolk left in this one.  Needless to say I hope this was the final fail so my wife stops asking for Red Robin. I was hoping she would have said Eureka burger but she was craving the good old guacamole bacon burger that Red Robin use to serve before they became Carl's Jr. Get it together you guys!

We went on New Year's Day at around 4, and with the two of us, the young woman told us it would be a 10-15 minute wait. We were seated in less than ten minutes. We looked at our menus for a good minute before our waitress (Kaitlyn H.) swung by and asked what we wanted to drink. To be honest, she didn't introduce her name to us, I had to figure out what her name was by looking at my reciept at the end of the visit. Anyway, we didn't have time to think about what we wanted to drink, so we basically said the first thing in our heads: a water and coke. She came back with them very quickly. A good 5 minutes later, she came back and took our orders. We got a California Chicken Sandwich and a Burnin' Love (chicken substitute). We also got the $7 Spinach Artichoke dip for an appetizer  The dip came out quick, but it was a small portion, despite being $7. The dip was good, but there was barely any chip, and most of them were either too oily or just raw tortilla. The rest of the food came in after we finished the appetizer. Boy, did I smell all the spiciness from the Burnin' Love! With my CA Chicken, I can barely see or taste any of the guac that was in there.  My boyfriend and I finished our steak fries in a quick moment, and we wanted more! Everytime we tried ti wave down our waitress (Kaitlyn), she wouldn't see it/ignore it or ask us for a refill on our drinks and then quickly scuttle away before we can say anything else. Whenever we would try say thank you when she gave us something or took something, she would walk away before hearing us say thank you or listen for anything else. After FOREVER, she came by and asked if we wanted more fries. Duh. She came back hella quick with our fries, but we were already full to enjoy our fries. She walked away before I can ask for a box. I pressed the ""call server"" button, but its like she never acknowledged it. It took about 10 minutes until another server passed by and asked what we needed, and by the time that server came back with the box, Kaitlyn dropped by to see what was up a little too late.

Tonight, like other nights, my burger was dry, sour because all you couls taste was the pickle with the relish. There was no balance. It was hard to even continue to eat it. Plus the waitress got my order wrong. They brought out appetizers too early, we asked and they confirmed they would come out with the main meal for my wife. However, they brought half of them right off the back. I definitely think paying $41 for mac-n-cheese, a burger, and 3 appetizers didn't hit the spot.

61,Camille B.,"Bakersfield, CA",192,225,60.0,4.0,2016-02-05,"I went to Red Robin yesterday to redeem my birthday burger. I have lived here for almost 2 years and had never gone because I loved the location in Sacramento I used to go to. It just felt like it wouldn't compare. I took a chance anyways. I walked in and the hostess was leaning on her stand and grinning at what I thought was me as part of a greeting, but apparently I was wrong. After standing there for a sec, she asked me how many I was waiting for and I said, ""Just me."" She then suggested I sit at the bar, which kind of ticked me off. Just because I'm a party of one doesn't mean I always want to sit at the bar!!!! I didn't really feel like dealing with her so I went and sat in the bar area in hopes of better service. Luckily, my hope became reality! I had this amazing server who was very quick on his feet, communicative, and his smile was contagious! I think his name was David. He was busy, but he would let me know he was on his way and since I was sitting alone, he seemed to check on me extra which I appreciate because service always seems slower (even when it's not) when you're alone. He got me everything I needed and was very kind. The food came out quickly and lived up to Red Robin standards, which is definitely chain food but still decently yummy. At my bill, he was a little slow to the draw as I had never used the tablet system and I was planning on paying in cash, so I waited for him to help me which took awhile. We had a little trouble with my rewards card but he was very helpful in figuring it out and kept a smile on, which kept my smile on.

All you can eat fries that are actually pretty legit, good chain-restaurant quality burgers, and ""mixologist"" crafted drinks? It's the quintessential mall eatery. Like, if Waiting (the film with Ryan Reynolds) was an actual documentary, it would be based on Red Robin. (I think the movie pulls from Applebee's/TGIF.) So I come in and the hostess sits me down at a table and points out this device on the table. It's not an iPad...it's a contraption with a touch screen. And she says I can order my drinks and food and appetizers and desert through it, so okay, sure. I ordered through it, and this guy brings out my food. I pay with my credit card on the contraption (kiosky thing?), and it asks if I want to give a 25% tip. But wait - who am I tipping?  The device or the hostess or the guy who brought me my food/drinks? The gal and guy were pretty nice but they didn't really do anything that warranted a tip. I mean, I understand the sociopolitical implications of tipping, and I do tip - usually generously (20% on average). And then there's the new state-mandated law that basically affects the way tips are shared (e.g., cooks/chefs don't get a portion of tips). I won't launch in to a diatribe, so back to my original question: Who I am tipping?

But the thought that they could've been leftover oil marks/sauce stains from the last meal was unsettling to eat off of. One of my sisters lost her appetite as she realized this halfway through her meal. That cleanliness issue ruined the experience for us. The red and white plates we had seemed clean but the black plates seemed dirty...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=60,2.64,3.11,3.11,2.636,2.9219999999999997
104,Julie O.,"Bakersfield, CA",6,1,,1.0,2016-07-07,"Today's visit was very upsetting.  My friend and I had ordered and appetizer but we wanted it as a meal so we had asked to switched the chips into fries. We waited forever for our food to come out. We each had our sons with us, my son who is 9 months old and hers who is 2 months old. We wanted our food out quick before they babies got fussy but that didn't happen. Mind you, when we got there the dining room was empty so we thought we would have fast and great service. It picked up just a tad bit and we still got sucky service. So after seeing everyone around get their foods before even though they had ordered way later and our babies being fussy from waiting there too long, they finally brought our food and they messed up on our order! So I kindly had told them we had ordered fries with these instead of the chips so our waitress then comes back with only ONE small basket of fries that apparently my friend and I had to share and our waitress continues to tell us ""you're suppose to tell us in the beginning that you wanted fries instead"" um excuse me ma'am yes we did let you know that we wanted fries and I had let her know that too. After realizing her mistake she was trying to be extra nice but we were already upset that she tried to pin that on us and on top of that it felt like our order was forgotten and we didn't feel as important as other guest plus having infants with us made it feel like this place wasn't very mother friendly.

If I had to choose where my favorite fries were from, then with no hesitation Red Robin would be in my top 5 to choose from. They have bottomless garlic fries and I always end up hardly touching my burger because of that. When my family and I are trying to figure out dinner and we all crave burgers, this is definitely one of the spots that is picked. Love the burger options here as their is a burger for everyone. The atmosphere is nice and the workers are always great. The good thing is, even though Red Robin is always busy, it doesn't take long to get seated. I don't think I've ever had to wait longer than 15min to get seated. Amazingly, I don't think I've ever browsed their desserts as I'm a sucker for sweets.

I understand because I used to be a server for 4 yrs. our server was a young Asian gal and quite frankly, she was rude. My husband and I look like a young Asian couple ourselves, but for some reason, when we get Asian servers, they treat us like we're second class citizens. She hurriedly took our order, barely managing a hi... As if we were inconveniencing her. And every time she would bring food to our table, she would set it down fast and not say a word. And then she'd walk away really fast...not asking if we needed anything. There was another older Caucasian couple behind us and she was very polite to them, constantly asking if they're doing ok. The time that she actually did come around to our table to ask if we were ok, she'd only look at my husband and ask him. That's one of my pet peeves when servers do that, whether it be a guy or a girl. When I served, I made sure to make eye contact with both and address the couple as a whole. Guess she didn't know I was the one paying and tipping. Because we've both been in the food industry, we tip very well and we are way more understanding than most people. Unfortunately, our server profiled us wrongly. The only good thing about the visit was that we got our food fast and it was hot. I'm so tired of getting crappy service in Bakersfield.

The meat was average, a little passed medium (I had ordered medium rare), bacon was cooked perfectly and was very crispy. Also the egg was cooked just how we asked. However, the bun was horrible as it seemed like the cheap buns from a grocery store. It's good they didn't cook the burger medium rare, because with the buns they used it would have fallen apart.

I'm not really the type of person to go on and write a bad review for a business, but in this case this is just something that a company must know when they lack having a ""Great"" customer service experience. From the moment I sat down the waitress did not acknowledge me or my family and we waited 11 minutes just to order drinks. Not once did our waitress ask us for refills or we wanted more fries being that they were bottomless. I had to hit the ""call Server"" button twice just to get any attention. I'm sorry but a good server is on top of their tables making sure the customer is happy and food tickets are being served on time.  To top it off the employee (who was a different server) who ended up serving our food gave me attitude when we told her that the order was wrong. We explained that we had ordered something on the side of the burger and after receiving attitude that she was not the server and she was just ""helping"" she said she would bring it right up and never showed up again.

Again, it was 11 am, so nobody had sat there yet for the day. But the table and the whole restaurant was filthy.  I asked for the manager. She placed blame on a ""contract cleaning crew"" who didn't do their job right and then put me at another table. But I watched and they didn't clean the table or the floor and just sat someone else there a few minutes later.  When my appetizers arrived the plates they gave me were filthy. Chunks of food and sauces stuck to them. I again called for the manager. Their solution was to bring me new plates. After the appetizers were cleared from the table they got back to me with cleaner plates.  My burger was different from every other Red Robin I have ever been to. Small and with meager toppings.

However, I explained to her that I already paid my bill using their manual system on the table. She obviously didn't believe me even though my friend vouched for me. It was embarrassing and I felt like I was being non trustworthy as she kept waiting for me to pay. Anyways, I paid. It's no surprise I called the next day when I noticed on my bank account that I was twice so I called the store and spoke to the manager. The manager apologized and said she would look into it. That happened on 8/6/17 around 9AM yet I had to call back while I was with my family out of town on vacation just to resolve this issue.

Very messy but a lot of flavor.  The steak fries are five star. The last couple of times I tried something different.  The fish and chips were not good at all. I'm not sure if it was cooking or quality of fish, but two of the pieces were so solid you couldn't flake the fish apart when tried to bite.  The next time I tried the chicken tortilla soup. Mediocre at best. Tasted more like a generic canned soup them something made fresh. More thick and gooey than a flavorful broth. My dining partner ordered his burger with a Boca Patty on both occasions. The first time it was still ice cold in the center. We sent it back and came out fresh and hot.  The next time it was warm but not hot, as we had a movie time to meet he dealt with it.  I do applaud them for having a vegetarian option and I'm sure they need to keep those frozen before cooking.  But a quick refresher to the cooks on grilling/microwave time would be good ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield?start=20,2.56,2.81,2.81,,2.71

6,Kenneth W.,"Bakersfield, CA",214,257,29.0,3.0,2017-08-29,"I'm not sure what I expected here, but it did not live up to what I was hoping for. Our waiter was nice, but this is one of those restaurants with a Ziosk. I feel that any restaurant I've been to recently with a Ziosk means that they expect their waiters to attend to more tables than what they would have otherwise. Maybe this is good overall, but I feel that we weren't checked on nearly enough (NOTE: I am not blaming the waiter/server, the waitstaff just does what they're instructed to do in a place like this.)  With that part mentioned, I should speak about what we really care about: food and drinks. Red Robin has lots of beers available to serve. They have a bar area as well. I am pretty sure that they have a full bar (I don't drink, so I am not 100% on this.) They also seem to serve craft beers based on the menus I did see. My children and wife are a fan of their ""freckled lemonade,"" which is strawberry lemonade with real strawberries in the drink. You can get it with regular Minute Maid Lemonade or the same brand's Light Lemonade. My kids ordered from the children's menu. One ordered a grilled chicken breast served on sticks with a side of broccoli. She usually eats broccoli, she spit this one out. She did enjoy the grilled chicken breast on sticks. She's two and though that was very cool. Kid #2 ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of mandarin oranges. She's not a big eater, so I don't think the sandwich was the problem, but she took only a few bites of it and thought that was enough. She devoured the oranges. I ordered from their classic burger menu and ordered their burger with a fried egg and two strips of bacon on it (I don't recall its name.) I liked my burger, but I thought it was odd that I was never asked how I wanted my burger. I guess the only option is well done at this restaurant, because that is what my wife and I both received with our meals. My burger was alright and my fries were about the same, but they weren't so alright that I will be rushing back here. The wife ordered from their specialty burgers. I believe it was called the Mad Love burger. It looked delicious on the menu, but her burger was beyond well done and was actually split in half before it was served to her. She said that the burger was so overwhelmingly charred that she couldn't even taste the loads of other toppings. I sampled the jalapeno relish that came with her burger and that tasted amazing.  We ordered fries with both burgers. I thought that they did bottomless fries here, but we were never once asked if we wanted another serving. I'm not sure why. The fries that came with our order were lukewarm and stale. They required lots of ketchup to make them edible. Normally, I love the steak fries here.  All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience, but the experience won't be making us rush back any time soon.

We waited about 10 minutes to even be put on the waiting list, as the hostess was busy. No problem- she was super apologetic and friendly, and we were seated within 5 minutes. My son (who is beyond picky) actually ate 3 bites of his veggie burger, and I devoured mine immediately. My partner had a meat burger which he liked.

It was just the floating in my cocktail. I alerted my waiter and he apologized and brought me a new one. It was all fine until towards the end of the drink and boom another one. I was disgusted and just wanted to leave. We got our bill and he charged me for the first drink that i didn't even take a sip of!      I didn't go back until a few months later...I decided to give it another go. Well i get my BBQ chicken wrap and there is a dark thick hair just sitting on top of the wrap. I mentioned this to my friends and family and they also have had similar experiences.

It's not about being picky or snotty, it's about public health and sanitation. This is how germs and diseases spread people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield,2.4,2.73,2.73,,2.598
14,Selena R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-16,"I waited 45 minutes yesterday for my simple burger which wasn't even done correctly. I ordered fruit and broccoli on the side. The fruit was very mushy and looked gross. By the time I was done eating my broccoli in a bowl, I noticed there was a dead roach in the bowl. The manager came out to apologize and gave a lame excuse as to why there was a roach in my food. I am done coming here. Too gross and not a clean environment. I'd rather eat somewhere and not have to worry about roaches hidden in my food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield,2.4,2.69,2.69,,2.574
1,Clara M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",97,9,4.0,2.0,2017-12-19,Horrible experience. They couldn't get the bill correct. The waitress kept giving everyone attitude and the managers were non existent ! The bread on my burger was hard and the bread on my other burger was soggy. You can tell the burgers had been under a heat lamp forever.  Correction : Manager just came to talk To us ( unexpectedly) and proceeded to defend the horrible customer service !  This is one of the reasons people stay away from the mall !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield,2.44,2.67,2.67,,2.5780000000000003

The cut, the crispiness and the portion was  perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bakersfield,2.48,2.65,2.65,,2.582
