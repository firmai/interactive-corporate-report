Being that things are so much different in Montana then back home I was pleased to find out that there was a ""Red Robin"" here me and my gf went and ate with our baby and it was very good the waitress was very patient, checked on us often, kept our drinks refilled, and the atmosphere was very clean including the restrooms. I ordered the blue cheese burger with endless fries for the first time it was well done just as I asked, and my girlfriends California chicken sandwich came out great as well the food was excellent, I'd definitely come back here before I leave and head back to California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-billings?start=20,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004

We have eaten multiple kinds of burgers and all wonderful as well as fries and onion rings. We always encounter a terrible wait when we go. The frustration is that there are open tables throughout but no one is getting sat at them.The new location also does not allow children to sit in the bar area, so this limits seating for families.

After our food came my husband took one bite of his onion rings and said they were disgusting then took a bite of his burger and found a BONE in the meat! I immediately told the waitress and she apologized and said she'd talk to the manager. The manager, who was apparently too busy to speak with us, waived the meal from our tab.

I mistakenly assumed she would bring us a new kids burger. Instead, it was taken off our check. That's all well and good, but my daughter left without eating a meal and I had to feed her at home, which defeats the purpose of going out to dinner!  My husband asked for Cheddar cheese on his burger and it came with American cheese.

It is amazing it took that long. We hadn't asked for a refund or to speak to the manager. However the manager heard of our unhappiness. Without request or complaint she gave us complimentary cards for an appetizer or dessert. We really like Red Robin's menu.  Perhaps this was an off time. We will try again.
