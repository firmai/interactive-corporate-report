Tabitha M.,"Independence, MO",120,166,34,4.0,6/7/2011,"I have ALWAYS wanted to go to Red Robin. I'm not even sure why, but never had a reason to since I didn't eat burgers. Well, now that I have stepped over to the dark [meat] side, I finally went! It was pretty-freakin-delicious too. I got the ""Burnin' Love Burger"" which has jalepenos and a slew of other spiciness on it. Yummmmy. The strawberry lemonade is bottomless and delicious, a good counterpart to the spice of the burger. My boyfriend got the ""bleu ribbon burger"" No complaints there. Fries were good. The girl at the next table ordered this gigantic pie thing that was seriously a foot tall and a tower of onion rings. Both looked AMAZING. I'll be going back. For an appetizer, 2 burgers, drink it came out to about $35",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=40

Cheryll M.,"Independence, MO",2,1,,5.0,12/27/2013,I love red robin because they carry gluten free hamburger buns! They mark my receipt *food allergy* gluten. So the cooks know and everyone involved with the order. They have dedicated fryers! Which means you can eat fries without worrying about cross contamination.

Jeanie S.,"Whiteman AFB, MO",1,15,,4.0,10/27/2012,"Our hostess and server were both very nice. The wait time on food (5 meals) was about 30 minutes. We were there with our three kids and the decorative walls and crayons and color-able menus kept them entertained long enough for them not to get antsy. My husband and I had bottomless root beer floats. They were awesome. Our food was fantastic. The place was definitely bustling with activity, but it didn't seem chaotic. I'd recommend this chain and this location in particular. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=40
Heather Anne B.,"Columbia, MO",12,222,,3.0,5/12/2013,"I really love Red Robin! My mom and I came here for a laid-back mother's day dinner and we got a table right away. We got some onion rings to start and they were delicious as always, but the burgers are why people come here. Their gardenburger is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever eaten. It comes with this tasty dijon sauce that I can't get enough of, and even though it's free to substitute any regular burger with a veggie patty, as far as I'm concerned I have found my go-to meal here. The fries are delicious and bottomless, but the servings are so generous that I never have room for a refill. But the service was poor and by the time we left, we were actually pretty frustrated. We were seated at a tiny two-person booth and nothing was cleared off. We simply didn't have enough room. Our onion ring tower sat in the middle of the table even though we finished it long before our burgers arrived, and our server dropped off refills without taking the empties. Maybe that's okay at a larger table but after three refills that meant five cups on the table meant for just two people. In general the service was also quite slow. We needed napkins but they didn't come until after we finished eating, and it was still several minutes more before we got the check. As a general rule, diners should NEVER have to ask for napkins, especially at a place that serves greasy burgers and fries -- those should be available at all tables from the start. Isn't that just common sense? Serving tasty food is only half the battle, Red Robin! Get it together and I'll bet you'll have many more happy customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=40

Greg H.,"Cameron, MO",0,112,,3.0,7/13/2013,The bacon cheeseburgers we had were hot and juicy but could have been cooked a little longer. We asked for medium well and they came to us medium. I should have asked to have the lettuce and tomato replaced with pickles and onions but that's my fault. The fries are a letdown here. Even though they're all you can eat they're frozen and fried in vegetable oil.

M F.,"Sturgis, SD",24,33,16,4.0,4/24/2012,"I went to this Red Robin to celebrate my birthday burger last week-end with my husband. This was our first time at this location, but have eaten at many other Red Robin Restaurants and have always loved them. I ordered mushrooms on my bacon cheese burger and we both asked for no salt on our fries. My husband ordered fish and chips and said the fish was some of the best he has ever had. A girl brought our burgers out and my burger did not have mushrooms and we had salt on our fries. By the time our waiter, Zane, finally got back to our table, we were without water. I also wanted mustard for my burger and I explained I didn't get any mushrooms on my burger. I had already eaten almost all of my burger since it had been so long. He did not apologize, nor did he get any mushrooms for me. He did not ask if we wanted refills on our water or fries. We noticed other people sitting and waiting as well. Our waiter, Zane, did not even acknowledge my birthday or ask if we wanted dessert, just brought us our check. This is the worst service we have ever had at any restaurant. Needless to say, we did not leave him a tip. In our opinion, tips are EARNED, not mandatory. I spent a few years as a waitress and I know what good service is, and Zane should not be a waiter! And, what do you know, today we look at our debit card bill, and see that Zane took it upon himself to give himself a tip and changed the tip amount to $5.00! I have my receipt showing the original charge and our copy showing no tip. This is UNACCEPTABLE! He should be fired. This is stealing and should not be tolerated! Update: I contacted the MGR, Michael Price at this location. He refunded the full amount back to my card and took my address to send us a gift card in hopes we will come back to Red Robin. We really appreciate this and will consider going back, only if Zane is not our waiter. Follow up: After several calls over two weeks, we finally got a $20 credit the manager said he would apply back to our credit card. He also sent a $50 gift card for our trouble after we reminded him twice that we did not receive it. He said it just got misplaced on his desk. We ate there again twice, and did not see Zane, the waiter. Apparently, he was let go, or he was not working when we were there. The food both times was exceptional, especially the fish and chips. Our waiter on the last visit (guy with dark hair and glasses) was the best ever, and he said he was working a double shift that day. We will definitely go back now and changed our rating from a 1* to a 4*.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=40
Doug A.,"Kansas City, MO",1,25,,3.0,6/25/2009,"My first Red Robin experience. The fries and burgers were tasty. I'd put it a notch above average. It wasn't fantastic, but was very good.  If you like a lot of choice in taste and toppings this is a top place to go to. They have a significant line of different burgers, what I guess you would call gourmet style. The one annoying thing, was the restaurant was very noisy. It was one of the most noisiest restaurants I've been to. Much of it had to do with kids. There were quite a few families with kids there. So if you like a quieter experience this may not be the place unless you pick your time better than I had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=40

Ray B.,"Lee's Summit, MO",95,110,87,3.0,6/20/2016,Went with a group of 5 and everyone was blown away with the food. A lot of 4.5-5's on food. I had the tavern burger and found it to be decent. The service was average - but is was a very busy night. We did appreciate the fry refill. My biggest complaint was the cleanliness of the place - very very dirty. It started with greasy lettuce all over my menu and was followed by the nasty bathrooms. If they cleaned the place up it would really help.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20
Rhonda S.,"Independence, MO",786,1010,914,4.0,12/21/2012,"I had a craving for a good cheeseburger, with French fries. I wanted a milk shake to go along with that. Other fast food places wouldn't do the trick. I decided to stop in at Red Robins.It's been years since I ate there. We arrived around 3:40, before the crowd. The place is often too crowded for me to consider. Besides I'm not a $9.00 cheeseburger person, hardly ever. We had Sally for our server, and she was witty, and helpful. I immediately said the salted caramel shake, and ordered it, on account of her suggesting it.   I also ordered a mushroom Swiss burger with endless french fries. I ordered it medium well. My mom ordered a Bleu burger with honey melons. When our order arrived, the sides were switched, but it was quickly corrected. My mushroom Swiss burger was thick with mushrooms, and a burger so large I could hardly get it into my mouth. I chose an onion bun. The Swiss cheese was also thick, and I could make strings across the table...that's bad manners, but anyway, it was delicious. The fires, I couldn't get through the first plate, much less take advantage of endless fries.  The fries were just fries, I sprinkled seasoning salt on them, and that really made them pop.  The salted caramel shake..Oh my...porn in a glass. On the picture they had caramel topping drizzled on the whipped cream topping, mine just had a pretzel topping. I think they forgot the caramel drizzle. It was delicious. Sally double checked to see if I liked it. She got a thumbs up from me. I think Red Robin is over priced, the $9.00 cheeseburger with a shake can add up. That is why I knocked them down a star. They are closer to 5 stars than 4.  Very cool interior with tons of decorations, and lights. On the menu, they will sub a veggie burger or Bocca for no extra price addition. I won't eat here too often, the price makes that not an every day visit, or even every month. But it's worth stopping if if a really good cheeseburger and shake are craved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20
Renee W.,"Independence, MO",9,36,1,1.0,10/18/2016,"I came here for lunch with my dad last Friday. We asked to start off with fries while we chose our entrees. What we got was a pitiful side of fries that had maybe 8 fries. They were beyond cold, even though the restaurant was packed, which was nothing short of bizarre. If Red Robin cannot even get the fries right, why eat here? We walked out and told the manager why and didn't really get much of a response or remedy except that he offered to get us different fries. We weren't in the mood for an argument so we just walked out and went to Thai Spice across the street. I am so disappointed because I am craving a good bleu ribbon burger and HOT fries, but I know Red Robin just isn't capable of living up to this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20
Siobhan S.,"Blue Springs, MO",0,4,1,5.0,1/13/2015,Burgers are amazing.

Sara C.,"Kansas City, MO",381,542,367,5.0,10/1/2011,"I decided to stop by Red Robin the other day because I had a coupon for a free birthday burger. My mom ordered the Octoberfest Burger (which is only $6.99) and I got the burger with a fried egg on top.  Let me start off by saying that our server was ADORABLE. He was young, cute, and full of ethusiasm for Reb Robin's product. I just couldn't get enough of him; he brought a smile to my face every time he came over to check up on us.  We chose to upgrade our bottomless steak fries for sweet potato fries for a 99 cent upcharge. The fries were super delicious and would have been even better if Red Robin offered honey. What we didn't realize until we got the check was that they charged us 99 cents extra for each basket of fries (we assumed we would charged only once since they were considered bottomless).  We came on an off hour so the restaurant wasn't as noisy as usual. I got a free burger and our server was the most percious thing ever, so despite the fry confusion, I'll go ahead and give them 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20
Carol A.,"Kansas City, MO",53,333,42,4.0,10/1/2011,"Our first experience with RR wasn't even in the Kansas City area. We were introduced to this really good burger place in Yuba City California. It was the favorite spot du jour of the kids of our niece Dina. Now when you let kids call the shots it may or may not be what you would have chosen for yourself. This time it was...and I might have avoided it if Hubby and I had been by ourselves.  Turns out that Red Robin makes hamburgers that grownups will like even more than most kids. Toppings like blue cheese, guacamole, ancho & fire-roasted poblano pepper are prominently featured on the menu. The choice of buns includes a kaiser roll, whole grain, onion and even a pretzel bun. These thick, juicy burgers are constructed and then 1/2 wrapped with white paper to assist you in eating them without all the lovely ingredients plopping into your lap. Red Robin is my burger lover's paradise.  So I was really happy when RR began building here in the Kansas City area a few years ago. And the one in Independence is an easy drive from our house.  We made our most recent visit there last night. Our server was Shelby and she was friendly.  She didn't show up annoying too often which is a plus for me and she didn't offer a refill on my coke but was there a time or two to ask if everything was okay so I could have asked if I wanted more. I ordered one of my favorites: The Blue Ribbon burger. Hubs went for the traditional RR Gourmet Cheeseburger. Both lived up to the standard we've learned to expect from Red Robin. Every burger and sandwich on the menu is served with endless thick cut steak fries. They are crispy on the outside but tender potato inside. (I LUV 'em...Hubby not so much...so I get his too if I want)  Being a Real Burger Fan, Red Robin is a reliable place to go when I'm craving an upscale burger. They have a very large menu that includes plenty of other choices of appetizers, chicken, fish, turkey and even a vegan sandwich, plus soups, salads and desserts. So IF YOU are hungry for a hamburger, but the other diners in your party want something else, there is plenty to choose from. As for me, Red Robin is one of my favorite places for a great hamburger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20
James T.,"Kansas City, MO",8,66,28,3.0,4/8/2014,Very noisy. Average value. The portions are large but the food is pretty standard. This would be a good place to bring kids or teenagers.

Grace T.,"Charleston, SC",26,130,29,5.0,6/21/2012,"I think this place is the first place that comes to mind when I think of hamburger places to recommend. I think what makes this place special is that each of their burgers really do have their own distinct, unique taste. I like Chili's bacon cheeseburger and Five Guys's little bacon cheeseburger, but I think this place really makes the flavors that should be in a great burger merry well.

I totally recommend bar seating when you go without children!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Madeline H.,"Kansas City, MO",0,29,7,5.0,12/13/2016,"Came here awhile back. The food was ok. I had gotten fish and chips. I could not fully enjoy it as i could taste the grease which means A.) The oil was not at the right temp to properly fry or B.) They did not allow the grease to drain off the fish properly. Now the fish itself tasted good. Very flavorful. Their fries are delicious and seasoned well. Everyone else got burgers, which is really neat how you can customize you burger ANYWAY you want it, however, I would not spend nearly  $10+ on a personalized burger. I can easily get an equally delicious burger cheaper at Five Guys or Hi- Boy. Like I said the food was good, but at the end of it with everyone getting their entree and a couple of apps it was $70 not including tip. To me it's simply not worth paying that much  for a fine dining experience...for burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Dawn T.,"Belton, MO",9,52,73,5.0,5/28/2017,"Daniel is an awesome waiter, very friendly and kept drinks and fries refilled. Fries were hot and fresh and awesome as usual.  I chose fish and chips today and they were awesome.  Save room for the donuts for dessert!! You won't be sorry!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Matt K.,"Independence, MO",586,9,2,3.0,1/28/2017,"It's alright. Loud, lots of kids and families. Not really in the top half of my favorite burgers, and the services it hit or miss. Also, what the hell? They haven't given me a free balloon in forever. What a ripoff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Harvey L.,"New Orleans, LA",45,55,312,4.0,2/11/2016,"If you like burgers this is the place to come. I have been here a few times and always enjoyed,  service is always very good as is the food.  Burgers always cooked exactly like ordered and fries always fresh and crisp. Had salad the last 2 times and were fresh and grilled chicken still juicy. Portions are perfect size so if you leave hungry it's because you didn't eat lol. Manger walks the floor and checks with tables to ensure everything is as it should be. They have a full bar and you can eat at bar with the TV but none on dining room happy to say. Great place for kids too and the entire family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Micaela D.,"Blue Springs, MO",25,13,5,5.0,3/18/2017,Lisa our server was amazing. Our food was fast and fresh. I love the new lettuce wrapped burgers! Thank you for a great lunch!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Pam G.,"Lee's Summit, MO",18,38,28,4.0,10/3/2016,"Great family restaurant especially with the kids. We visited this past weekend. I tried the A1 peppercorn burger. It is super tasty. My kids always eat the Mac and cheese.  They have nice games for the kids to play to keep them occupied. From the paper that they can draw on and play tic tax toe. They also have a game machine on the table that kids can play. Had games, trivia etc.  they have recently updated the inside and did a great job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Jordan F.,"Independence, MO",0,26,7,2.0,10/29/2016,"Good food as always, terrible service last visit. Came in, got seated quickly, got our food order and that's the last we saw of our waitress. Someone else brought our food, then nothing after that. No drink refills, we wanted shakes but no one came still. Luckily they have the pay at the table tablets or I fear we would have sat there all night. I paid and we walked out without being acknowledged. Very upsetting visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Michelle W.,"Blue Springs, MO",23,30,36,4.0,8/24/2016,"This place always provides a good meal for a decent price (depending on what you order). On this visit our service was pretty good but our ""endless fries"" were few and far between. Our waitress seemed to get them to every other table though. On this visit I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, it was okay but not much better than one from McDonald's or Sonic, not near as good as Chick Fil-a.  My absolute favorite sandwich here is the Chicken Bruschetta (grilled chicken breast, fresh bruschetta salsa, pesto aioli, provolone,Romaine lettuce and balsamic cream on ciabatta bread), it is so flavorful! This is the sandwich I will be getting from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Duane K.,"Raymore, MO",49,67,24,4.0,6/5/2016,Once again the wife and I had the pleasure of taking lunch at the Independence MO Red Robin. This joint is always busy a testament to location and consistent service. RR has always been on point for us cocktails through burgers. With the exception of the Westport Flea Market in Kansas City this Red Robin may be one of the top burger joints in town. A special S/O to Matt the manager for checking on us to make sure our experience was a positive one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
M. M.,"Lee's Summit, MO",4,59,,3.0,5/29/2017,"Stopped by here Saturday with my husband for a quick bite for lunch and as always burgers and unlimited fries were very good. If it hadn't been for my husband pointing something out I wouldn't have noticed the discrepancy in the seating that afternoon. When he left to the restroom and came back he noticed how people who were 35 and younger and with/without children sat in the larger restaurant section. Those with someone with graying hair sat in the separate section near the bar, which was odd. I didn't believe him until I got up and looked around. Yes, all those with children sat in the larger section, but there were plenty of adults who did not have children and were seated with someone of younger than 35 or 40 age in that larger section. One or two people who seemed older who sat in that section had someone who seemed younger than 35. My husband unfortunately has that early gray gene so we sat in that sequestered area. Very strange!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Debrah L.,"Grain Valley, MO",0,27,1,5.0,12/21/2015,I love this reaturant. Very good food and staff are great. Onion rings are great We alawys get that 15.00 Hamburger. Yum Yum.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Lei C.,"Independence, MO",149,124,120,5.0,2/7/2015,"We went here around Christmas time. We were impressed with the friendliness of the hostess and the short wait time.  Before we even placed our order the waiter brought fries to our table so we wouldn't be starving. I wish I remembered his name because he was awesome! He was polite, courteous, and helpful. My husband was so impressed with the service he thought about asking him if he needed another job. You know the waiter has good customer service skills when your husband wants to hire him!  As always the food was great. Red Robin is always the first place our daughter wants to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
Zach A.,"Lee's Summit, MO",0,59,24,4.0,8/1/2016,"Fantastic burger selection!  I am a huge fan of the Bleu Ribbon.  Blue cheese, crispy onion strands, and a chipotle aioli mayo!  Cooked to order and you get to choose how you want it cooked which really puts it a step above in my book.  Hard to get a piece of meat that isn't cooked to a crisp these days.  I like to have mine medium.  If you want and endless amount of fries that is an option too.  Go here try out a burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2
