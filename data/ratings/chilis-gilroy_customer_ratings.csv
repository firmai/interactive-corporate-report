101,Trooper S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,23,,1.0,2012-09-24,"This is the 3rd visit to Chili's in Gilroy and will be our last. Driving from LA to Palo Alto there is not much to choose from and seem to always be very hungry when I arrive in Gilroy. Chili's seems to always be the only place open at 9pm. Service has been horrible and very slow each time we have stopped. We waited for a server to greet  our table for 10 mins, drinks took another 5 mins to get, the food was slow to come out in which it appeared to be very slow for the restaurant. Something has happened with our order every time we have been here. On our latest visit (9/24/2012) the chicken was undercooked and pink in the center in the Margarita Chicken dish.  3 strikes to Chili's and you're out. We are never stopping here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=120,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.7640000000000002,2.72

112,Peta B.,"Salinas, CA",2,151,14.0,2.0,2012-10-13,"The place is alright, the food is good overall although some dishes could benefit from bolder and more creative flavor and spice combinations. Sticking to the basics can be a good thing, but there's still room to be creative and put some more flavor into it. As someone pointed out, there are better options in the area - if you're in a small town, passing through, I'd definitely recommend it. One excellent thing though: the molten chocolate cake, the main reason my husband likes to come to Chili's. It's reliable and mostly solid but as the 2-star rating description here reads ""I've experienced better."" I was actually torn between that and a three star rating, it's the latter that made me go with 2 stars. We're not impressed with the new, more modern decor; the old down-to-home decor was better is ask me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=120,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.832,2.64

If this had happened to us once, okay, but this is the FOURTH time that this has happened.  It almost happens in the afternoon when employees are changing shifts.  It's just shoddy service and the restaurant will comp my meal but I don't understand why they just don't stop doing this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=60,2.92,2.92,2.92,1.6360000000000001,2.92

You know what you're going to get and because of that I have no problem going here if that's what I'm in the mood for.

When we did eventually get our food, because the wait was quite long especially for a very slow afternoon,  not only was my steak cold all around, they had brought my father a cold hamburger cut into quarters instead of sliders. When my father said something, because the waitress didn't mention anything, she claimed they were out of sliders. She never came out to ask him if he would like to order something else, and she didn't even say anything when setting it down, like she was hoping we wouldn't notice.  The whole reason we had gone to Chili's was because my father wanted their sliders.

Instead of them just automatically changing it to what the menu said the manager comes out and says sorry about that I will ""discount"" that for you but we ran out of our kids menu and printed out menus from online so it's suppose be 4.99. We told her it wasn't about 40cents it was the fact that it didn't match what was shown on the menu to us.

We were seated immediately and then forgotten about for 15 minutes when no one at all came by to take our drink orders. After 15 minutes of being ignored by all the servers walking by helping other tables, we finally flagged down a waitress who said she'd get our server. Then she came back to say she'd be our server. She took our drink and food orders. The drinks came quickly after, but we waited over a half an hour to get our food. At this point, we'd been there nearly an hour without food.  Meanwhile, a couple came and was seated after us, ordered and received their appetizers before we even got our drinks. Their entrees came before ours as well, and we didn't even order appetizers! An hour into this miserable dining experience, our waitress was nowhere to be found and neither was our food, so we had to flag down ANOTHER server to ask him to get us the manager. The manager, who paced around the restaurant like he was lost, did not apologize for the appallingly bad service, just said he'd check on our ticket. He shuffled back to the kitchen, and we never saw him again that night.  We eventually got our food, but the orders were incomplete. Two of the meals were served without french fries (which showed up 10 minutes after the food was delivered), the ribs were served without bbq sauce, and the chicken was hopelessly overcooked. The waitress showed up again to give us the bill. She did not apologize for any of the blunders that night, or explain the poor service (if the kitchen was having issues, etc) just handed me the check. One of our meals had been comped, but the entire meal was such a disaster, that I don't think comping the entire meal would entice me to go back there.

58,Zippity D.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,57,16.0,1.0,2014-06-02,"The Gilroy Chili's is probably the biggest smelly armpit of all Chili's in the chain.  If yelp had negative stars, my one star rating would equate to 1 bazillion negative stars. There was so much wrong with our visit to this stain of a feed hole, let me just highlight the a few top line items that any restaurant should be acutely aware of: #1.  When every empty table (and most were empty), has dirty dishes, food all over floor, spills between tables and what looked like some kids vomit in a booth, well, you really should be busy cleaning it up as to not repulse new diners walking in the door hungry wanting to spend money there. Note to yourself: if the place looks really bad and dirty when you walk in the door, don't eat there! If you have to practically beg to just get your table re-cleaned because its sticky filthy dirty, maybe it's time to walk out instead and go somewhere else. This is advice I should have followed.  #2. People ask for water because they are thirsty. If you serve them dirty water glasses with Food floating in the water and dirty glasses with food stains all over them, that's not good. It's so not good, it's disgusting and downright vile that a restaurant thinks that's even OK. On days like this, I wish for 1 day I was a county health inspector. If so, this place would be red tagged closed in 2 minutes. #3. Ignoring your guests because the big joke in the kitchen is Julio's love tryst with Juan is all the rage ain't cool to those wanting to order food and eat. Great that you like to have fun at work. Try to remember the reason you have ""work"" is because people with money come there to be eat food and get some sliver of service from you. If you think it's more important to brag about your boyfriends new tat or belly piercing, then maybe you should work in hair salon instead. #4. Automated mini ordering kiosks at the table Chili's, really? Lame.  Wait staff telling you to use a machine that doesn't work to get a check and pay? Lamer. Whole IDE of machines serving your customer? Lamest idea ever. As said earlier, there was so much wrong with our visit to Chili's in Gilroy that I just highlighted some of the big things. The food quality was pretty bad as well, cold fries with our burgers, meat under cooked, vomit 3 booths away from us..... Did I mention the vomit 3 booths away from us?  A very long time ago, early 1980s, Chili's used to be a fun, clean place for Lunch or a Family outing.  How times have changed. They have turned it into an over priced experiment in public health disasters on the same level of the great plague, Chernobyl and a county hospital filled with oozing goo all rolled into one serving of sugary water and poison beef or chicken niblets to the masses.

82,Scott B.,"Aromas, CA",1,50,1.0,2.0,2014-08-23,"2 stars because the server was good. That's it.  We walked in to a seemingly empty dinning area around 1:30 pm on a Friday and we had to wait for a table. Why? I'm looking around not seeing many people.  When we finally were seated, the host gave us 2 names of who might be serving. Again. Why wait 5 minutes when 2 servers for 1 table?  And then told us about that stupid ziosk. Not only is that thing a disconnect from your server, it changes screens as a distraction to try to take your attention from the people in your group. Top it off it has games for 99 cents? What has this world come to where parents can't deal with their kids during a meal and spoils them even more or ignores them by playing games? I can't only imaging how dirty those ziosk screens are.  The server was nice and prompt. But didn't ask how we like our burgers cooked. Maybe we didn't have a choice?  The speed, quality and quantity of the food was bad.  Took over 30 minutes for 2 burgers and a chicken sandwich.  I did mention it wasn't full of customers.  Our server did come by to apologize for the slow speed. I think she knew what the real problem was but didn't tell us. (The chef is slow) My food arrived some what warm. The burger was advertised to have 4 strips of bacon. It barely had 2. Looking at the cheese, it was sitting around for a while. I had about 10 French fries. Same burger status as my other guest. The chicken sandwich was reported to be good coming from a non-complainer. I ate it because I was so hungry. I'm not a breakfast eater and it was close to 2:15 by the time we were served.  Overall we have always had good luck with all the other Chili's restaurants.  Not this one.  What I don't understand is, why the owner or manager of this one doesn't do anything about the low rating. Clearly I'm not the only one with this feedback.  We'll guess what?

Prior to this visit.   The food was in poor condition.  First we ordered Chips, salsa, side salad and drinks all were in eating condition  As for our main course we ordered which was lacking regarding the preparation for he food.  1st order was Lighter Choice Salmon (cal. 540 Lightly seasoned seared Atlantic salmon. Served with rice & steamed broccoli. We received: a small piece of salmon and double broccoli (which was not order), the broccoli was room temperature and had about 30 grains of rice.  See picture below.   2nd order was Classic Ribeye 100% USDA thick-cut steak marbled for maximum flavor & topped with garlic butter. Served with loaded mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli. We received: a small piece of Classic Sirloin - 6 oz 3rd order:  Make it a combo: Half Rack Of Ribs and chicken Served with mashed potatoes and a corn on the cob. We received: Cold ribs, cold BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes and broccoli 4th plate:Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich Crispy chicken with our spicy Buffalo sauce, fresh sliced tomato, lettuce & house-made ranch. We received: This was the only meal served in acceptable condition.  However the waiter at our table was great our food was awful!  Upon speaking with the GM, Amber Shigihara  she offered excuses for the poor food services stating they were busy and she was in the back cooking as well.  We expressed that we didn't want excuses and that the food was not in serving condition and the GMs reply was ""Im not trying to give excuses but give explanations"" which was unacceptable.   We were disappointed in the food service and the GM's reply that we returned our meals and paid for the drink and  one plate out of the 4 plates ordered  that was acceptable to eating order and left.  We as a family make visits to Chilis about 4 to 5 times a month and this was our first unacceptable meal service.  We will not be visiting the Chili's in Gilroy again!    Melissa Corral",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=80,1.76,1.76,1.76,1.4440000000000002,1.7600000000000002

We ordered our food and disappointment set in.  I am allergic to dairy and my burger had cheese although I had requested none and informed the server of my allergy. My wife complained that the egg rolls were super soggy, but she is too nice to send them back and told me she would just deal with it.  My son loved his pretzels but it's not super hard to please a toddler with food.  I had to ask 4 times for cheese sauce for them though since that is the only way he will eat anything... dipped in sauce.   Believe it or not, the food was the GOOD part of our experience.  The place is filthy.  The server wiped down our table for us since we got there as the other couple was leaving. There was food on one of the chairs so she wiped that too.  It was a high table that wouldn't accommodate a high chair so when my wife spotted a table across the bar that was low, we asked if we could take that one instead.  The server used the SAME towel to wipe down that table... not rinsing or using any kind of cleaning agent. No thanks, I don't want some guys butt touching my table please since you just wiped a chair with that towel.  I think the health department needs to check this place out. Thank goodness my wife is a germiphobe and carries lysol wipes in the toddlers diaper bag.  She wiped down the table because there was no way my kid was eating off of that.   Also witnessed one male server towel whip another male server's butt.

The salsa was tangy and good for an appetizer. ~The nachos we ordered were already very cold when served.  ~The vegetarian fajita was an utter disappointment. I would call it broccoli salad. ~ The enchiladas were okay thanks to all the cheese. Overall, the food lacked flavour. Service  ------- If not for the lousy service, I might have given a three stars. Too bad, we weren't even checked upon regularly.  This place makes me lose the last hanging thread of faith I have in chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy,1.92,1.94,1.94,1.864,1.932

I'm not a fan of the fact that they keep changing the serving dishes or menu. I'm a taco lover but all of the new ones are waaaayyy too soggy. It's impossible to eat like a taco and they serve it on such a tiny plate that juice gets absolutely everywhere. Feel like theyre trying too hard to be modern.

I gave the 1 star bc Natalia our server was sweet, and kept a smile but I feel like the manager who had her and another waitress scheduled for lunch hour rush failed her.
