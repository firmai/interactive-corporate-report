Gigi G.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",88,67,115,4.0,12/14/2017,"As far as airport food goes this was a great spot. I loved that the pizza was ready (yes i know that makes it less ""fresh"") because we were in a rush to catch our connecting flight and were starving!  Had the chicken BBQ one and it was delicious, since this is my first time at California Pizza I am not sure I can compare the airport pizza to their normal locations but I admit the airport pizza was delicious.  Thankful this place was here because every other option that was ready to go was bland (salads and sammiches).  Will be checking out one of their restaurants soon so that I can compare but super happy with the experience and food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2

Leah J.,"Indianapolis, IN",222,77,150,2.0,5/30/2017,"I absolutely love pizza. Pizza is my life! Pizza is bae. Pizza is one of Gods best creations... however this pizza was just.....okay......My cousin and I came here because we had a long layover trying to get back to Indianapolis and decided to eat at California  pizza. I have been wanting to try it considering we have a California pizza in Circle center mall in Indianapolis. I am glad I was able to try it out and it probably will be my last time unless I go there for a party or special event. The staff was nice, the salads were pretty, and the environment was chill. It was appropriate for quick airport food so I am glad it was an option.  Pros- Friendly staff  Toppings flavors were good  Crust was good  Cons-  Pizza seasoning could be improved.  Expensive",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2
Lisal F.,"Louisville, KY",57,210,126,3.0,4/6/2017,"Airports are not known for inventive, ground-breaking cuisine, however good food is slowly but surely becoming easier to find.  Such was the case at CPK at the Charlotte airport.  The air conditioners were on high that day, and I was desperate to warm up with some soup. The menu boasted not one, but TWO vegetarian soups:  Sedona Tortilla, and Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley. Have never tasted either before, I was torn, but was shortly saved by the friendly lady at the register who swiftly scooped up samples of each, allowing me to make an educated decision. I chose the tortilla soup, and was handed a large bowl that was both flavor-filled and warm. I would prefer to pay less than $8 for a bowl of soup, but in a freezing cold airport, CPK's Sedona Tortilla is a pretty good plan B.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2
Chad C.,"Lexington, KY",425,823,1603,3.0,12/12/2015,"This isn't the best place in the world to eat.  We had few options near our gate and little time to get something.  So for a late brunch breakfast, we picked this place.  I had a breakfast panini. It was bacon and egg panini and super dry.  I had to cover it with hot sauce and mayo.  It wasn't the best, but not the worst.  It took us a while to get waited on because the lady who was suppose to take the order was out socializing with a friend in the dinning area.   I should have ordered a pizza instead.  I won't be back to be honest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2
Joanna T.,"Wauwatosa, WI",415,2214,1025,2.0,5/24/2016,"Pretty typical airport food experience:  *Inflated prices *Limited selection *Indifferent, borderline rude staff *Cramped, dirty seating area It's not the same pizza as proper CPK restaurants - the crust is different.

Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2095,1278,2627,1.0,3/28/2016,"I've had California Pizza Kitchen many times in my teenage and college years, so of course when I found out there was one at the Charlotte Airport, I made a beeline for it.  I was tired of the other food court restaurants in the center of the airport. I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza (Duh! Signature CPK!) and a small SmartWater and that set me back almost $18 - yikes.  Airport prices for ya. After a 10-15 minute wait, I finally got my pizza.  I took it with me to my gate so I could sit and eat in peace.  This was literally the worst pizza, let alone CPK, that I've ever had in my life.  The crust, or lack of crust, or bread, or whatever you want to call it, was reminiscent of stale flour tortilla with supermarket BBQ sauce and like a few pieces of chicken on top.  The best part of the pizza was probably the fresh basil they had on there.  I can't even begin to explain how hard it was to chew the pizza given it's strange, chewy texture.  I should have taken a cross-section of the pizza - it was literally as thin, or thinner, than a flour tortilla.  Maybe a half-cooked, 3 week old tortilla. Save your money and eat at some other expensive airport restaurant.  And skip the $5 SmartWater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2
Rachel D.,"Houston, TX",12,140,96,2.0,12/6/2016,"I really should have done some research before coming here. *Sigh* Normally CPK is really good but you might want to pass on this airport location. The pizza lacks flavor and they skimp on the toppings. $12 for a personal pizza is too much, especially if they are skimping on all of the toppings!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2

Liz M.,"Colleyville, TX",60,210,116,2.0,10/10/2016,"I hate that my son spotted the CPK right across from the Admiral's Club, because I suspected that we would soon be in for an unpleasant detour. I was not wrong. Overpriced, tasteless pizza served by surly staff. I don't mind paying $12 for a pizza when it is hot and well prepared. I DO mind it when the server pulls the greasy box of pizza out from under a counter, where it had been sitting for God only knows how long. Nasty. This outlet takes advantage of hapless travelers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2
J David H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",757,1095,19946,3.0,1/14/2015,"First time at CPK for breakfast. I cannot recall seeing one at an airport. Located in terminal B. I asked for recommendation. Egg & Cheese was said to be top seller. Service by manager friendly, no issues with ordering process on a slow morning. Prices high, but an airport, so you know the drill bend over. Food out within 5 min and was in a huge to go bag. They never asked if for here, or to go. I was eating in. Dining room spotless and quite large. Nice bar in the middle. A few CPK pieces on the wall for atmosphere. Sandwich above expectation. Hot, fresh eggs, gooey cheese and crisp bread tasted to perfection. Liked and if returning would get it again. A nice grab and go area us up front constantly manned by an employee. Solid collection of drinks and food items. Visit except for not asking if dine/carry out was excellent. I will return if back in the area and now look for them in airports.

Avyaktha K.,"Charlotte, NC",11,63,145,4.0,10/23/2016,On our way to NY we stopped by for quick bite. We Ordered Vegetarian Pizza and The original chicken Pizza..

Jim B.,"Buffalo, NY",95,313,608,3.0,2/9/2015,"I like to fly into Charlotte. It's a good hub that isn't dreadfully large and difficult to navigate. My only complaint is the food stands here; I've seemingly never had a good meal on a layover. In comes the California Pizza Kitchen... I'm not going to get you all giggly thinking I'm going to say the food impressed me. No sir, not by any stretch of the imagination. But there were some bright clearings in the sky. First of, the service behind the counter was very professional and fast. Secondly, in addition to the core pizza kitchen restaurant, this location boasted not only a standard airport ""quick lunch"" kiosk attached to it, but a bar named ""Taste of Carolina"" that you could order CPK food from. I mean, I wouldn't (Pizza from California? Don't be ridiculous). Having a bar in the bullpen is a super bonus when all of us miserable souls need to stuff ourselves in a plastic flying machine and chuck ourselves cross country at 30,000 feet. For me, it's a moot addition, considering I always keep a bottle of embalming fluid in my carry-on for sedation purposes so I can stomach the high cost and close proximity to the other miserable people (Relax. I only pack it in a clear container sized at 3 ounces or less). Note: DO NOT drink embalming fluid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2
Ben S.,"Chesterfield, MO",255,1114,616,4.0,8/4/2015,"Limited selection but they will sell you whatever is coming out of the oven for stock instead of making you wait for your pizza.  Reasonably priced compared to other airport food.  I appreciated the military discount also. I grabbed a margherita pizza and walked right onto my flight with it.  Once seated, I had a quick piece and it was still a little too hot to eat.  They sprinkled some fresh basil on top before handing it to me and I really enjoyed the freshness of this delicious herb.  Nice bite and chew to the crust and a slight saltiness in the sauce made it a pretty dang good pie in an unexpected place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2

Lauren W.,"Englewood, CO",0,59,3,1.0,6/5/2017,"First and last visit to this franchise. The cashier wasn't even familiar with the items on their menu and kept asking me to repeat my order for their pea and barley glop. (I've had better pea soup from a can.) She was already irritated and her confusion added to her attitude. We had to clean off one of the several empty tables even though the staff was standing around chatting with each other. The bar-b-que chicken pizza was burned, the artichoke and spinach dip with stale chips was so gross.

Rebekah T.,"El Cerrito, CA",4558,2004,10336,3.0,10/30/2012,"After my last meal at the Charlotte airport, I decided to stick to something I knew and went to California Pizza Kitchen. I hardly eat at chain restaurants at home, but it seems this trip was all of that.  Truth be told, I really came here, because it has a bar attached and they were playing the final playoff game before the World Series and being a Giants fan, that was my priority.  I had a seat facing the TV, ordered a nice local lager on tap and a Margarita pizza from CPK next door. My beer was fabulous and the pizza was pretty good. I liked how the dough bubbled up and was light and airy.  Even though my review should be about the bar next door, this is what I ate and it was definately a lot better than my last meal here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-charlotte-2?start=20
Alexander W.,"Bowie, MD",235,169,16,4.0,7/29/2015,"For a CPK the food is somewhat basic and 'quick', but it is an airport location where speed is required. The staff are direct, to the point, and professional.  Taking orders and calling numbers from behind the counter constantly. The location is somewhat dirty, had to clean a table myself to have a place to sit. The food ...  The pizza are all flat, personal size, pizzas - I am sure this was a decision based on being airport and the speed factor of cooking.  The selections are about what you find on a regular CPK menu, the flavor is also about the same.

Lindsay C.,"Hanson, MA",251,628,488,3.0,5/16/2012,"I honestly was planning on eating at another restaurant in the airport, but their service was too slow and frankly, I had a flight to catch. Pizza sounded... meh... but I was hungry and needed a bite. Ordered a regular cheese pizza (personal size) and a 20oz. bottle of coke, which racked up to $12.21. ACK! I could have ordered a REAL plate of food elsewhere. On the upside of the receipt, there is a ""coupon"" for 10% off the gelato place next door. Seating area was pretty small, very little room for single-person seating. Limited condiments for your pizza. I found a few packets of red peppers, but no parmesan cheese. Flavor was lacking, pizza was very bland. Sauce had very little flavor, crust could have been out of a box. The only reason they got 3 stars is because it's the fastest way to get food in an airport.
