The boneless wings were pretty good to appetize on SERVICE: The lady that served us was like she didn't want to wait on us. She came back to our table like twice.

6,Courtney H.,"West Bountiful, UT",18,3,,1.0,2014-07-05,We usually have good servers when we go there but our recent server ruined our experience. She was more interested in talking to her family then helping us. Our appetizer took forever to get to us and then it was cold. The kids mac and cheese we ordered was kraft not the usual and then I asked for a to go box and she couldn't bring us one because she had to use two hands for one drink. We won't be back.

I can understand that eating out is a luxury and I don't intend to be waited on like a king, but when you're paying $14 a plate for a group of 16, I do expect more. This place was pretty abysmal the night we went, I felt bad for them. Our orders were bungled and took an extremely long time to make it to the table. Service was very scarce, making the final payment a long, drawn out procedure. Overall, this definitely put a damper on our family time.

24,Jeremy P.,"Austin, TX",113,69,25.0,1.0,2014-12-28,"I'm generally not the kind of person who reviews restaurant chains. For the most part, we all know what to expect before we walk in the door. There are some exceptions... some good, some bad. This Applebee's experience falls into the terrible column (yes, I just added a column). I must preface this review before I continue. I grew up in Utah for the first 34 years of my life. I recently moved to Austin, Texas. With that said, I'm very familiar with the draconian liquor laws citizens in Utah have to put up with, but this place took it to a new level. It's easier to order a beer at Temple Square than this Applebee's location. I had to do some last minute Christmas shopping on Christmas Eve. I decided to pop-in to Applebee's for a few beers after I finished up. I knew I would have to order food with my beer. Most restaurant chains in the area have a restricted beer/liquor license that require people to order food with their alcohol. I knew this going in, so I wasn't offended when she asked me if I was going to order food. After I placed my order, she asked to see my ID. I'm 36 years old, and can pass for anywhere between 35-45. Apparently, it's this franchise's policy to have a second person check the ID. I would understand another round of verification if I looked younger, or was acting weird, but this seemed overboard. To make things worse, it took her 10 minutes to track down the manager to verify my Texas-issued driver's license. Once she verified my ID, she brought out my beer and salad wedge. I sat quietly at the bar and worked on my laptop for an hour. She brought out a second beer, without giving me static. I ordered a third beer (in the span of 2 hours) and things got weird. She told me that she was going to have to cut me off at 3 (company policy I guess). That was fine by me, I wasn't planning on ordering more, but it seemed weird that she mentioned this before I even asked for another one.  I understand she was playing it by the book, but it seemed strange that she was so adamant about enforcing rules before they were broken. I'm not sure if this location had been penalized for violations in the past, but the way they were serving me, it made me think they've had some previous trouble. The issue that bothered me most was that she acted put out and judgmental while she was serving me. That's the first time a bar tender has ever made me feel that way, which is why I'm giving this restaurant a 1-star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bountiful-2,,,,,
26,Susan R.,"Centerville, UT",42,92,11.0,3.0,2015-05-06,My second time to applebees ever! Our server was the best he told us to get a chicken dish he loved and it was the best. The rest of the food we got was just good not amazing by far. The manager came by to make sure we like everything.

25,Kyle J.,"Salt Lake City, UT",204,172,24.0,3.0,2015-08-03,"I usually come to Applebee's when it's past 9 and I've had quite a few adult beverages for half price apps. This is the first time in probably four years I've been to one where I have been 100% alert. The first thing I noticed is they are absolutely trying to lose the ""random sports pictures everywhere"" vibe and trying to class themselves up a bit. Their menu is still huge and all over the place, but it's not a bad selection of choices at all. On Sundays and Mondays they have a 6.99 burger. Just a great deal. I got the Triple Bacon Burger because I'm looking for my first heart attack at 30. But I was very surprised by the burger itself. I was expecting something to be over-salted and dry, but it was well seasoned and moist. The flavors were all there and wasn't over powering at all for having three different types of bacon flavored substances on it. The fries tasted like they were drug through the Salt Flats though and the interior itself was dirty for a slow Sunday, but overall a pretty pleasantly suprising experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bountiful-2,,,,,
29,Kenzie R.,"Centerville, UT",31,1,,1.0,2015-09-24,This Applebee's has the worst service I've ever experienced. I ordered a meal and half of it was left off of the plate. Then the waiter only came to the table once to take our order then after that a different person came to the table to bring out our food. We never got refills or even asked if we wanted one. Not to mention the man at the bar made a veteran cry because he refused to serve him a drink even though the vet was getting his id out. This Applebee's goes against the Applebee's policy's and they most definitely are not at par with quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bountiful-2,,,,,

As my wife and I entered the foyer there were many people waiting to be seated with no host. We waited for a almost 5 minutes and began discussing other options like Rumbi. Finally someone came up to the front and acknowledged us and asked us to wait while those in front of us were woken up to be seated. During this time I couldn't help but notice the abundance of empty booths and tables. We were eventually seated. Our waitress was very efficient, patient, and courteous.

On my last two visits we were served our first drinks by somebody other than bartenders (they seem to be everywhere but behind the bar.)  On one visit the manager was sitting at a table near the bar, fully aware that we had been sitting at the bar for minutes with no service, but he ignored us anyway until I asked him, ""Is this a self-serve bar?"" I've been to countless Applebee's all over the country and this is the first one where I observed employees eating, drinking and yucking it up at a bar table while ignoring patrons.  It's pathetic.

Last night I was foolish and thought to give Applebee's another try. Big mistake!!!! The only reason I am not giving only 1 star is because the manager comped our meal - but it was so bad that had he not I would have been calling corporate today. We ordered simple - a kids corn dog, a plain burger (no cheese, bacon, onions, etc ), a medium-rare steak, and French onion soup as my appetizer. The only meal that was correct was the kids corn dog - but had they screwed that up we would have had a whole other issue. First, they completely forgot my soup and by the time the waitress came back by our mess had been delivered. Second - the plain hamburger had cheese on it (my sister is not able to eat dairy at all). Third - my steak was medium-well and the shrimp were obviously frozen and under cooked. Finally - when they finally brought the new burger, it now had no cheese but had onions, pickles, and bacon IN the burger (on it we could have removed it). By this time, my daughter and I were completely done eating so we had to go to McDonalds on the way home to get my sister something to eat. I appreciate the managers honesty that the waitress put the orders in wrong, but I have never had a good experience at this Applebee's and will NOT be back under any circumstances.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bountiful-2,,,,,
0,Jeme D.,"Bountiful, UT",0,16,,1.0,2016-02-17,"We went to Applebees because usually it has good prompt service and a decent meal at a decent price. There were not more than six tables of people in the entire place at 5:30 pm. The visit was so wrong in so many ways. First, it was myself, my husband, and my Mother-in-law. All of us are over the age of 55. We had to produce our driver's licenses since we ordered a beer and a wine to go with dinner. We were told to leave out our ID's as the manager needed to see them to verify our ages. The manager never came. Our beverages sat waiting at the bar for more than 15 minutes. Finally the bartender brought them over. Since we had not seen our waitress since being harassed about ordering a glass of wine and a beer, we placed our order with the bartender. The food seemed to be prepared quickly by the kitchen. The waitress never came back to check on us, refill drinks, or anything else. We tried to use the payment kiosk at the table to pay and leave. It was broken and would not process the transaction. So, we finally flagged down our waitress to take our payment. She couldn't get it to work, either, and went to find the manager. How did the manager handle the situation? His direct quote, ""I hate when people are too stupid to use computers."" Well, I'm an accountant and my husband is an industrial engineer. We are NOT STUPID. Mr. Manager should find a new line of work if he feels all of his customers are stupid. I stopped in for a quick dinner with my husband and mother-in-law.

They revamped their food and both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. We just went here because my wife thought they had a weightwatchers menu, which, if they did, it's now gone. They DO have a lighter menu though, so we stayed. I got the brunch burger, she got the whiskey chicken. Both were delicious, and I realized after the fact that mine was steeply discounted since it's a Monday.

It was nothing that knocked my socks off but the prices didn't hurt my checkbook either. Likes: our server was friendly and was helpful with recommendations. I ordered the Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp. It had lots of flavor and the right amount of shrimp. We also ordered the boneless buffalo wings for an appetizer. The mild sauce had more kick than expected but were just right. The portion sizes were great and the food came fairly quickly. Dislikes: the food wasn't amazing, just mediocre. Also, our waitress somehow got distracted halfway through the meal and forgot to bring some things that we had asked for earlier. It wasn't the end of the world. The red potatoes that came with my chicken were very bland. I actually had to use the extra ranch dipping sauce from our hot wings to give them some flavor.

Nicks apologies after putting me on hold for 10+ minutes were half hearted and not what I expected. He said they were closing because they weren't busy, but the reason I was on hold for 10+ minutes was because they were so busy. When cornered in a lie he put the blame on the corporate office.

16,Layne P.,"Kaysville, UT",11,122,4.0,2.0,2016-10-17,"I have not been to any Applebee's for several years.  I'm not sure why, but I'm just not drawn to this type of restaurant (cookie cutter building and menu).   When each member of our family has a birthday we let them pick the place.  No one else gets to say anything.  My son picked the Applebee's in Bountiful, so off we went.   It was a Friday night at about 7pm.  We had 7 people in our group.  The place was about 2/3 full. (Strange for a Friday night)   When we walked in there were three groups waiting.  We waited about 20 minutes for them to push a couple of empty tables together.   While we waited, two additional groups came in and were seated before us.   Again, I want to point out that the tables we were eventually seated at were empty when we walked in.  Perhaps they didn't have enough help?  I don't think that was it because there where three people hanging around the host desk who seemed inexperienced and confused.  Perhaps some additional training is in order.  This was not a huge deal to me.  We were not in a hurry.  It just seemed strange.   The place was clean and well cared for.  The restrooms were clean and well maintained. The attempt at local decor (typical of AB's) was nice.  Now, here is the reason I give them a 2/5.  It is the menu.  Before I go on, I want to state that I'm not a vegan, or a vegetarian.  However, most of our group is working on eating a more whole food plant based diet.  If you are trying to eat this way you should not ever go in another AB's again.  Most places at least give a nod to the growing number of WFPB diners out there, but AB's seems to have made a specific and deliberate attempt to exclude them.  There were only a couple of side items, one soup, and a small salad on the menu that were not meat-based.  Again, it was very strange.   You may be tempted to come back and say that all you have to do is ask and they would take off the meat, but that is not the point.  If the chef and corporate don't care to provide tasty WFBP designed selections on the menu, then I'm not going to go in begging them to take the meat off of something that was designed around the meat.  I almost asked for one of the salads, but when I looked closer I realized that if they pulled the meat off, all you were left with was a pile of iceberg lettuce for $12.  Not much of a ""salad"".   Finally, our server was a bit odd.  He seemed put off that were were there.  He tried to be attentive, but it just came off as patronizing and perfunctory.  I was taken-a-back when he raised his voice across two tables at a server that ""took his table"".  It was a very uncomfortable situation.  All of the guests in that section heard him.  It was not something that you would expect from an experienced server.   I do have to say that I appreciated the free birthday treat and song that they provided for my son.  It was a small scoop of ice cream with some whip cream on top.   Bottom line: 7 people.  No drinks (we all had water). No appetizers.  No deserts.  The bill was right at $100 including tip.   When we got home I found one of my sons eating chips and salsa.  He said he didn't get enough food to eat at the AB's.   Along with McDonald's and a few other bottom of the barrel dining establishments, I have now added AB's to the list of places that I never need to visit again in my life.   There are enough places out there that do care about what they are serving that I don't need to go to an AB's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bountiful-2,,,,,
