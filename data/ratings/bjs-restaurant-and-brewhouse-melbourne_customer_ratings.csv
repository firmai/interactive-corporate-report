This location seems a tad smaller than their Orlando Millenia location, but the food (Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie!!!) food is spot on for BJs.

24,Ava G.,"Melbourne, FL",224,35,1.0,5.0,2015-07-27,"Late Sunday night and hungry, I think all Melbourne residents have ran into the problem.. what's open? Aside from the very played out TGIFs, Applebees, etc.. we gave one of the new restaurants by the mall a chance and BJ's kitchen is open til 12 am on Sunday! The atmosphere of this place is awesome. A mixed vibe of Yard House and World of Beer. Menu has something for everyone, and although it's not ""Cheddars cheap"" you will get every dollars worth with the portions sizes and quality served. The Rewards program is also a nice little niche as well!  Will absolutely return again, and I hope they have the Sunday Ticket coming up this September! Update 7/31 Went back again for soup and appetizers. I would skip on their soups, nothing special for the $$ Mac n cheese snack was also below average, but stuffed artichokes were great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=40,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002

98,Elaine G.,"Rockledge, FL",9,24,2.0,2.0,2015-07-31,Horrible experience... Waited over an hour for a table so was expecting good food.

57,Charlene H.,"Indialantic, FL",58,24,310.0,3.0,2015-08-01,"I visited last night with my family. A party of 3. I was excited to try this new restaurant that just popped up in my area. The decor is urban industrial much like a lot of the new restaurants. The menu is a big book where the first three pages are nothing but brews, wines, and cocktails. The rest of the menu was the usual things like sandwiches, burgers, pastas and deep dish pizza, which was on my mind. So I split the medium Gourmet Five Meat deep dish with my Mom.  She thoroughly enjoyed it but I found it to be rather dry , lacking cheese and sauce. The crust was crispy and had a good flavor but I had to order a side of marinara. The appetizer of artichoke bites came out late but I don't believe it was the servers fault. The manager came out  and personally apologized which was very professional and appreciated. My brother ordered a personal great white pan pizza and I tried a bite. It was delicious and creamy with alfredo, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes. The side wedge salad was delicious and they gave me extra dressing and blue cheese crumbles upon asking. I will return one day but will try the parmesan crusted chicken I was eyeing or a different pan pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=60,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
96,Rochelle H.,"Gainesville, FL",7,4,,2.0,2015-08-01,"Tried this for lunch today with my husband and son. Good concept, poor execution. The wait wasn't bad and the order was correct, however the service was terrible. We had their ""signature"" deep dish BJ's Favorite pizza which wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. My son had the BBQ  brisket bacon burger which he did rave about. The style of the place is that service is provided by multiple staff. My guys got rootbeers which were very good. My husband finished his mug and placed it on the end of the table. I watched as at least 6 wait staff walked up and down the aisle visually scanning the tables. His glass sat there empty for no less than 20 minutes without anyone asking if he wanted another or even to clear it. I over heard one young lady tell the table behind us that she was helping train the staff. She also walked by at least 4 times without acknowledging his empty glass. The final test? A box was requested for the remaining pizza which never came. Think they need some more time to get their act together and some better trainers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=80,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003
21,Gemma S.,"Indialantic, FL",10,5,,2.0,2015-08-02,"Went at about 1 o'clock on a sunday. Was told there was a 25 min wait, a manager then came up to me as I was giving my name and told me a booth at the bar opened up, after he sat me, I sat there for 10 mins while no one greeted me, and he sat at the top of the stairs and made no move to make sure someone was coming to the table. Someone finally dropped menus off (not our server) and I waited another 10 mins to be greeted. All in all it was 25 mins before I even had a drink in front of me. Any where else, I would have left by the time it got to 25 mins with out a drink, but I really wanted to try it.  I got the brussel sprout appetizer and they were burnt, and looked nothing like the picture in the menu. My entree was good, and so was the beer. Our server was sweet and attentive once she actually got to us. Next time I think I'll save this place for having a beer at the bar while I wait for Togo food.

The food was really good.  The manager was super nice and really tried to make it all good.  We waited for 42 minutes for our food and the restaurant was 1/2 full.  THE server did not check on us at all.  We got there at 8:12pm And left at 10:12pm for 3 dinners.  And one was salad. The manager comped the dessert and 1/2 the bill.. The server  brought it out and said the cake part of the strawberry dessert was not made right so was bringing another. The next one came in a 2 go box DUH... It was the strawberry shortcake dessert with ice cream and whipped cream and a hot piece of cake..now this is the good part, she forgot the strawberries..She needs to keep her day job. I actually tipped her too. She never smiled or acted interested in our table.   So don't sit in Melissa's section if u can help it!

32,Julie F.,"Rockville, MD",15,7,,5.0,2015-08-04,"I had a great experience here: TL;DR: Come get awesome beer and food here. Have some patience with the kitchen service, they just opened.  Long Version: First of all their beer is pretty awesome; not only do they have a great selection of craft beers, but they also have a wide variety of their own brewery's beer (brewed in California but still awesome quality).  Second, the food was really good. Important seeing as it is a restaurant and not solely a place for me to nerd out over beer. They have an extensive menu and a lot of different selections for those of us who want to save some calories for the copious amounts of beer to be had. I plan on coming back to try their burgers and a bunch of other items on the menu...their pizzas looked pretty awesome too.  Finally, the kitchen service was pretty slow...but that is to be expected when a restaurant has just opened. What made the slow food amazing was the service our waiter and the whole waiting staff had. They accidentally sold our dessert to another table, instead of hiding the mistake and blaming it on some random occurrence they completely owned up to the mistake and told us what happened. The manager came by and gave us both a complimentary dessert voucher (of which we plan on using when we come back) and made a potentially bad situation into a positive experience.  I have high hopes for this place and plan on watching a few games here. Thanks for finally adding some good beer and food to the Melbourne food scene.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=40,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676

101,Tiffany L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,2015-08-08,"This was a poor experience, which is sad because I'm not typically a complainer, and we were so looking forward to trying this restaurant. We waited quite a long time for our food once our table ordered, and when my top sirloin steak came out, it was extremely over cooked. I sent it back and waited 30+ minutes for another. By the time it came, everyone else was long since finished with their meal. Although it was cooked better the second time around, it was a dense, sinewy cut of meat. I found I had about 6 edible bites. There was no effort on behalf of our server to give any kind of break on our bill due to the steak or the wait. I understand the restaurant is new but customer service is key. I won't be back for their food - all 3 of us who ate together agreed our meals weren't up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=100,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
79,Tonya H.,"Palm Bay, FL",136,282,549.0,2.0,2015-08-09,"I do not even know where to begin....I let's start with the pros.....cool place to go if you like beer. They had a ton of beer on tap and they offer a flight of 4, 5 oz pours for $7.95.  Their happy hour ended at 6:00 pm, which was a bummer ( I missed by only a few minutes, because I thought it was 7pm. But it did offer $3 for 2 of their craft beers on tap and $50 shareable apps, and mini pizzas. I have to admit that's all the pros I have because the rest of the experience goes down hill :(. Mom and I opted for the calamari for an app.  You know it's bad when the server comes over with her face squished up because the food was burnt.  She stated it never comes out looking that dark.  It was greasy, gummy, and not crispy at all. I asked the server for some recommendations, she stated after 2 weeks she had only tasted 1 meal and that the restaurant did not offer the servers samples of the food before the restaurant opened.... We move on the meal....The deep dish sweet pig pizza.  I had high hopes for this one as many people there ordered the pizza and it looked decent.  However, I was sadly disappointed.  Now I like butter as much as the next southern girl, but I don't want my pizza to taste like it.  Not to mention as I ate the meal, I kept thinking that something was off with the taste but could not put my finger on it.  We then looked a the menu...and they forgot to add the pineapple to the pizza which was clearly in the description (and I loves my pineapple).  So disappointed.  I forgot to mention we had the stuffed mushrooms, which were just ok.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the server without me prompting, or asking her.  Found the manager and was able to have the calamari and pizza taken off the bill. Kudos to her!  The mixed drinks are also pricey, pomegranted martini (which tasted like a tart slurpee) was $10.

Some very good menu items are tavern cut pizza, burgers and fries, tomato and mozzarella salad, house salad, homemade sodas, fired mozzarella sticks, salted caramel pizzukie, and strawberry dessert. Food brought out fairly quickly after ordering. Nice decor and interior. CONS: Long wait times when you sit down, they have to solve this. Website issues preventing ordering on-line. My take out order took an extra 40 minutes. I sat at curbside for 40 minutes. The server gave me free fries and 2 sodas.  They totally botched my wife's Santa Fe salad. Pan pizza not great. New Orleans Jambalaya way too spicy, almost inedible, they need to adjust this recipe. One night we ordered coffee and they had no creamer of half and half.

Here are my issues:  First: the food isn't as 'fresh' tasting. I really liked the one in Orlando because it was a chain restaurant that I didn't mind going to. Here, food doesn't taste as 'fresh.' In fact, it tastes no better than food from your local Chili's.  Second: The service is slow. Like really really slow. I understand they just opened, but it's been three weeks and they still don't have it together. Did I say slow?  Third and most appallingly: the price! My fiance and I went in for a dessert (that we split) and one drink each and the bill was over $30 before tip. The pricing is insane. Not a good way to greet a new market.

At this time I showed them my mac n cheese was completely dry not creamy, and inedible. He agreed took it back. I picked out the bbq chicken pizza next- at this point my friends have finished their meals. 45 minutes later a server comes back I ask for my check and request to take the pizza off my bill as I never received it. We were at the restaurant for over 3 hours in total and I really feel they should have comp'd my beer at least since I was never served a correct dinner and left the restaurant hungry after being made to sit for so long.

100,Rachel C.,"Melbourne, FL",25,4,4.0,2.0,2015-09-20,"I need to start off by saying that the ribs were delicious - tender, moist, and flavorful. Those delicious ribs are the sole reason this place is receiving two stars as opposed to one because everything else was pretty horrid. From the absent server to the bone-dry mashed potatoes to the overcooked, shriveled asparagus, all the way down to the completely uncaring, useless manager, this place just fails.  We had a party of three and were sat in a booth in the bar area. Right off the bat we ordered waters and a beer, and the beer took a good ten minutes to get to the table despite the restaurant (and bar) being pretty dead. There were only a handful of tables sat throughout the entire restaurant with more than enough wait staff to cover. Waiting on our server for no apparent reason was definitely the trend for the night. The other two members of my party ordered a half rack of ribs and when we received our food their racks were considerably different, so the person with the 2/3 sized rack asked about it. Eventually the waitress came back and told us the cook just made a mistake when cutting them. That was it. No solution offered.  She did ask the manager to stop by our table, but this only made things worse. The manager did not apologize, did not bother to fake a smile/good attitude, and she failed to even ASK about our experience AT ALL. She simply said she would bring out more ribs (keeping in mind we informed the waitress at the very beginning of the meal and the manager couldn't be bothered to stop by until long after we'd finished our food and were just waiting idly with our partially consumed plates). Had she asked about our experience she would have learned about the unsavory side dishes and extended wait times. The waitress eventually stopped by to ask if the manager had come over and started to leave after we answered yes - we had to flag her down to ask for our checks. When the manager brought the ribs to the table, she again failed to offer an apology or ask about our experience - just dropped the bag at the table and left.  The icing on the cake is happening now - we arrived home and opened up the ribs to try and uplift the evening, and unlike the ribs we enjoyed in the restaurant, these are chewy and burnt from being thrown on high heat.

The restaurant feels very open but still a little dim ambience. It has mostly dark woods in the decor. There's a large bar with about 50 taps, and booths, chairs and tables in the adjacent dining area.  Service: Jasmine was our waitress and she was a sweetie. She did forget our bread and we had to re-ask for our appetizer after the cooks made a mistake, but other than that, she was a great, friendly waitress.  Food:  we thought we were going to order beer, but saw two margaritas we had to try instead. We got an appetizer, but filled up too much to eat our meals. So typical. LOL!  --Jalapeño Cucumber Margarita - 5/5 - LOVED this!!!  It was just the right balance of tart, spicy and refreshing. It had fresh cucumber and jalapeño slices in it. LOVED --Watermelon Basil Margarita - 2/5 - Although the flavors were nice, this had a heavy sweet flavor I could not drink. Just too sweet!!! Not sure if they add sugar or it's the watermelon syrup, but I was looking for a lightly-sweet watermelon flavor the way fresh watermelon juice is.  --Sriracha Queso Dip with Pork Salsa Verde - 5/5 - so good!  I loved the Queso and salsa; however, the pork was pretty nonexistent. Still a yummy dish.  Rack of ribs with Root Beer BBQ sauce - these were great!! They had to add the root beer sauce on top of the pre-basted ribs, but it was really good!!   --Sides with ribs: Brussel sprouts and French fries - 4/5 - I liked both. The fries are thin skinny fries and were lukewarm, but still tasty. The Brussel sprout were not bitter at all and roasted good.  Overall:  good food, nice waitress and great drinks!!!

I ordered a flat bread and a salad and it was decent. I gave them an extra star because our waiter, Brent was GREAT! He was fun, friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  I will go back because it is good for groups and really affordable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
3,Aracely M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,20,27.0,1.0,2017-08-28,"Disappointing! Was looking forward to enjoying a burger w/ fries and waitress, although very sweet, forgot the fries/utensils. Burger buns were cold, no barbecue sauce on burger & cole slaw? Are you serious? It was very brown & very dry. I truly have never felt so disgusted after leaving what's supposed to be a really, nice, classy restaurant with great food. I feel like just making myself throw up! Will definately be sending the pictures I took and send to corporate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
63,Dennis W.,"Melbourne, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-04,"I anticipated a nice place to have a few brews,  and walked into a foul smelling funky restaurant. I initially thought the smell would go away, but I couldn't bear to sit in there and got sick to my stomach. It smells like an old dirty mop that has been left in an old bucket and has went sour. I don't know how people eat in there!! The manager should be relieved of their duties and have a cleaning crew come in and clean that place from top to bottom. What a shame. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne?start=20,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
10,Tiffany D.,"Tallahassee, FL",16,5,,3.0,2017-09-30,"Probably my last visit to this restaurant. Nothing is really good here which is a shame because it has a good ambiance. Ordered the bacon guacamole burger sans mayo, cooked medium rare. My son ordered same item but with mayo, cooked medium. Guess what- both had mayo and the kitchen runner could have cared less what the burger temp was. Sides were left off, too. No silverware, had to request drink refills (some were alcoholic so you'd think that would be a no brainer for the server). Pointed out issues to server who said, ""Oh, ok.""

6,Meg B.,"Melbourne, FL",0,7,,4.0,2017-11-01,"My boyfriend and I love coming here to enjoy a nice meal every once in a while. It's a bit pricey for some certain dishes, example: the spaghetti and meatballs is almost the same price as a sirloin steak, but that's a very minor complaint. The staff is very accommodating and we never run into any problems with this place. So many different menu options to choose from and everything is delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne,3.36,3.29,3.29,,3.318

My husband really liked getting a free beer. They also don't limit what you can order like most places. You get $12.95 off you meal. Hubby had a hamburger and fries, so mush he couldn't finish. I had the Jambalaya was nice and spicy. Rather than wait for a table we sat down at the bar. The service was just as good and no waiting for a table. This is one place we will be glad to return to .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-melbourne,3.36,3.28,3.28,,3.3120000000000003
4,Manny C.,"Casselberry, FL",230,43,62.0,5.0,2017-11-22,Amazing service and fantastic food! Came here for BJ brews on Wednesday for $4 amazing. I recommend the BJs Hefeweizen which is smooth and light. I had the spicy peanut chicken and soba Noodles. It was amazing. I forgot to take a picture because it was so delicious but I highly recommended. Ask for Brittany when you come here. Outstanding waitress.
