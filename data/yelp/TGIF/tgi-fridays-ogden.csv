Vici T.,"Ogden, UT",4,14,,1.0,7/7/2014,"Drove by Riverdale, Ogden location today and the store is closed! The signs have been ripped right off the outside walls. What in the heck happened? Great food, friendly staff, awesome margaritas! We still have $50.00 worth of Gift cards. I am unable to find other locations in Utah. Every time I click on a ""fridays"" link I get an error message. Can anyone advise?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ogden
Mike M.,"Ogden, UT",1,20,6,4.0,4/1/2013,Open before 4pm unlike a restaurant next door. Food is a coin flip at times but beer is always tasty. They have a few combo dinners that can make things cheaper. You can never go wrong with a burger. Also the shrimp pasta is tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ogden
Brittney C.,"Clearfield, UT",4,43,,3.0,11/13/2010,Not the best food in the world. The only reason I would go back would be for the green bean fries with wasabi- yum!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ogden
