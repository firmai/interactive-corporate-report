24,Richard H.,"Somerville, NJ",52,111,1.0,2.0,2012-09-18,"It's a Friday's.  What can I say? We stopped in to kill some time midday on a Sunday.  Grabbed a drink & watched some football in a packed bar.  Hostess & bartenders were friendly, so points there.  But I'm not a fan of ""run of the mill"" chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
28,Steve C.,"Marietta, SC",67,19,,2.0,2013-07-28,"I like TGI Friday's as a restaurant chain but this particular one is consistently bad.  The food regularly comes out cold, and on two occasions it has take an hour from the time we order until we get our food.  The first time it took 30 minutes before a server took our order.  Today everyone in our section of the restaurant was very frustrated and demanding refunds.  The manager did deduct about half of our bill and that is the only reason that I might give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12
26,Dawn A.,"Barnegat, NJ",21,2,,1.0,2013-10-12,"To Whom It May Concern, I went to the TGIFridays #1682 located at 601 Washington Ave in Manahawkin, NJ 08005. The people who do take out orders never get them right. The first time when my order was wrong I was in the restaurants and was too full to eat dessert and wanted to try the new desserts. We never order desserts and wanted to try something new. So my mom and I decided to get the desserts to go and share them. We got the Salted Caramel Cake and they gave us the ice cream but never received the salted caramel glaze (which is the best part) and we also got the Tennessee Whiskey Cake and they gave us the ice cream but never gave us the butterscotch Jack Daniels Whiskey Sauce (which is the best part). I called the restaurant and told the manager and she asked me if I wanted to come back and she would give me them but I was already in my PJ's so she comp me 3 desserts. Tonight 10/12/2013 at 7:13pm I gave an order of 1 Loaded Chips, 1 Sesame Jack Chicken Strips and add extra Jack Daniels sauce, 1 Jack Daniels Burger Pink and add extra Jack Daniels Sauce and 1 BBQ Pork Sandwich Oval Salad with Thousand Island Dressing and add extra Jack Daniels Sauce. All three were right but of course mine was wrong. I had the BBQ Pork Sandwich and instead of salad there was fries which I do not like fries and NO Jack Daniels sauce (which is the best part). I go to Fridays a lot and have a fridays reward card and always get rewards but Applebees has you beat with there take out. First when you call Applebees, they dont keep you on hold on the phone for more then 5 minutes and arent annoyed with you when you are ordering. Then when you pull up there is 2 spaces dedicated to Applebees take out. Not on the side of the building like your spaces are located down to the back of the restaurant. Then they come out to your car for the payment and bring you the order so you dont get out of your car. Not like your restaurant were you have to get out like tonight in the pouring rain and go to the bar where the bartenders are annoyed they have to take care of you and get your order. I tipped Applebees good when they go above and beyond there services and tip all my waiters and waiteress good when service is good but will not tip the bartendars when they seem annoyed with me picking up dinner. I didn't call tonight to complain but took the survey and emailed you about my experience. My Check # is 5728 and I put the check on my Fridays reward card also so you can check out my check to see.                                                                       Very Annoyed,                                                                       Dawn",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin?start=20,,,,,
23,Lucy D.,"Nantucket, MA",41,682,41.0,1.0,2014-02-01,I should have been a bit more patient and traveled down to a different restaurant. This is an older Fridays that needs a face lift on the outside and the food needs a face lift on the inside. Service at the bar was slow- and there were only 3 other patrons sitting at the bar. Bathrooms were clean. No return visit here....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin?start=20,,,,,
25,Jen J.,"Stafford Township, NJ",2,16,2.0,1.0,2014-10-24,"Gross! Smells awful when you walk in...like beer was poured all over a carpet and has been soaking for months even though there's no carpet in the place.  I can feel the stickiness and filth of the floor when walking to my table.  We were there for lunch on a Monday.  The host said they ran out of kid menus/crayons so when the waiter came over I asked if there happened to be one laying around at another station or in the back and he did eventually find one and brought it over which was cool since our 3yr old was with us.  The food was a joke. the burger had half a bun for the bottom so you could not pick it up to eat. My husband asked for ranch with his wings, the waiter explained they were out of ranch dressing until the delivery got there.  How, in this day in age, can you run out of something like ranch dressing when there is about 5 or so retailers that are within 1/2 mile and carry ranch dressing for times like this??? Ordered a strawberry lemonade for my son and it was so sweet that even he wouldn't drink it so I watered it down as best I could with my club soda.  We didn't complain; it's Fridays so we didn't expect much and that's just about what we got. Poor judgement on our behalf. Never going back there.  They won't last much longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin?start=20,,,,,
17,Laura D.,"Hillsdale, NJ",0,7,,1.0,2015-04-20,"GLUTEN SENSITIVE BEWARE Despite having a gluten sensitive menu, the server we encountered had no idea what he was doing. After much discussion he served my daughter her GS burger with a side salad loaded with regular croutons. If company has special menu and then neglects to train staff what is the point? Also wonder how much the kitchen really knows about this? No confidence and wouldn't chance this again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,
13,John H.,"Randolph, NJ",246,4,,2.0,2015-08-19,"All I can say. Meh There's little atmosphere here. No music, staff is lack lustre, and it smells like piss. I'm disappointed. Also, the staff is flirting, which is ok, but it's in poor taste with children present.  Honestly...not pleased. Service was pretty crappy too. Sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,
16,Kevin K.,"Waretown, NJ",0,22,4.0,1.0,2015-10-19,"Food passable, draft beer selection limited, but the furniture is absolutely filthy, grimy with age. Indicates a lack of attention to detail. Plus a filthy tin ceiling--and how did that happen?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,
20,Lisa T.,"Manahawkin, NJ",0,49,,1.0,2015-10-22,"No, just no.  The only nice thing I have to say is that our waitress was very nice.  That is it.  She took our drink order.  I opened the menu to decide what I wanted and thought it was wonderful that they ""smear"" a little sample of each item on the pages, so you can get an idea of what everything is like.  The soda was flat.  My husband excused himself to use the bathroom.  He came back almost immediately with a look of horror on his face.  He said it looked like a toxic waste dump.  When the waitress came back, we asked for our bill for the sodas.  If you choose to ignore this review and go there anyway, I would suggest contacting your doctor for a dose of antibiotics about a week prior to your visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin?start=20,,,,,
15,John N.,"Manahawkin, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2015-11-08,"Your establishment has gone down the toilet. It use to be a nice place and was enjoyable to dine at, now it is not even worth driving by. In fact, we will drive by it to go to Applebee's.  Just some things to validate our poor experience -  1. Hostess should worry about customers and not his telephone 2. When the waiter comes to take our drink order, he should not have his phone ringing in our ears. 3. Cocktail napkins are just that, not torn in half napkins. Some were even dirty. 4. When the customer says they are there for dessert, the waiter should not wait until the customer orders to tell them they no longer have that dessert available. 5. All the food orders should come out at once, or at least within 5 minutes of one another. 6. To charge separately for coffee and Kahula is ridiculous. Almost $ 11.00 for a small drink. That should be considered price gauging. 7. You should clean your tables before you seat guest. We will never again go to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,

Yes it is a chain but I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  The steaks are great and the service has always been fast and friendly-- we always enjoy it We get a lot of "" tourists"" down here with little to no patience -so maybe it's like the song says;  You only get what you give!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,

0,Patricia A.,"Tuckerton, NJ",5,35,14.0,5.0,2016-02-09,"2-9-16. Met an old friend for a leisurely lunch. Our waiter, Jesse, was very friendly and attentive!  He took very good care of us and we can only say nice things about him and the job he did! I ordered the Jack Daniels burger ( I love the JD bbq sauce!!!)  and my friend had an $8.99 lunch combo of French onion soup, hand-battered shrimp, and fries!  It was a lot of food at a great price!  She also had a Pink Punk Martini, poured over pink cotton candy ( see the pic).  It was delish!  Our food was consistently good, we were treated very well, we were not rushed..... It all adds up to a five  visit! Btw, be sure to get a Stripes card!  With it you get a free order of chips and salsa at every visit and points add up to get you free food coupons in your email. Every month or so, you will also get a free entree coupon in your email !  Free food always tastes better!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,
19,Justin P.,"Cape May, NJ",13,45,,4.0,2016-04-05,Pretty expansive menu and so far I have yet to find a meal here that I have not enjoyed.

3,Sivin R.,"Belleville, NJ",15,17,4.0,4.0,2016-06-25,"Had a pleasant experience this evening with the family. Our server Nicole was extremely polite and patient. The kids enjoyed their burgers. Most other TGIF'S are a bit lackluster with their service but this restaurant on this particular day was a nice turnaround. The Mahi Mahi was delicious. So much so, that my lady thought it was very tasty (especially for someone that doesn't eat fish). She ordered her usual chicken and spinach combo which she liked very much. This place gave a small glimmer of hope to a chain that had been slowly spiraling downward. Good job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,
14,AL S.,"Tuckerton, NJ",0,30,,3.0,2016-09-27,Was there last night for dinner. Our waitress was good. My girlfriend had pasta with shrimp.  She said the taste was ok but to much sauce.  My cheese burger was good but not close to medium rare.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,

My one son was annoying and he handled him fairly well. Placed a to go order as well and it came out timely and our visit was good. The sesame jack chicken strips need to be bigger portions. And consistent. And the Caesar salad w sirrachia shrimp was ummm not what I expected. And shrimp were cold. I thought with most chicken Caesar salads the chicken comes out warm on it so I assumed they would not be cold - salad was just okay. To me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,,,,,
10,Emily D.,"Tuckerton, NJ",50,26,10.0,5.0,2016-11-13,Krista and Shelby were great. They made me an amazing mango margarita! I usually have great service when I sit at the bar.

9,Valerie L.,"Tuckerton, NJ",0,7,10.0,2.0,2016-12-07,"Food is bleh. I had the bean burger and it was way overcooked. Almost inedible. The place is clean-ish. It hasn't been updated in forever, and the look is old and bland. Which is weird to say with a million knick knacks all over everything.

4,Amy M.,"Mountain Top, PA",1,4,,1.0,2017-01-02,Second time in a year that the service was terrible. Orders were wrong or incomplete. Even after asking to fix it they didn't.

12,Kim S.,"Seaside Heights, NJ",16,40,26.0,4.0,2017-01-05,"I visited this Fridays a handful of weeks ago on a Sunday...  I was in the area early in the day and stopped in  with my Mom.  We sat in the bar area and I was impressed by the restaurant set-up.  There were really cute cubby areas with high-top tables throughout the bar.  Tons of televisions throughout, but not obtrusive.  The server and bartender were both wearing football jerseys which I always think makes the atmosphere more fun, along with their kind and helpful personalities.  I think the menu has severely changed since I've been to a Friday's and it took me about 15 minutes to get through the whole thing!  Stuffed jalapenos, Jack Daniels Chicken and my Mudslide (don't judge me lol) were all delicious! I actually bough Friday's gift cards for some friends and family this Christmas because I know they'll be as impressed as I was with the changes! Just a small note....between drinks, appetizers and lunch the check gets a little hefty soooo as for value I gave that 3 stars....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

8,Brandon M.,"Brick, NJ",77,48,26.0,1.0,2017-07-18,"This location is simply behind the ball when it comes to service and cleanliness. We visited this location with the hope of having a quick meal and getting to our event on time. When we arrived the restaurant was not busy and we were seated right away. After we were seated it took approximately 15 for our server to come and greet us and take our drink and food order combined(we had ample time to look through the entire menu during our wait). The server took our order and ask if we were stripes members so that we could receive the free chips and salsa(we are members). She then brought our drinks back and we waited an additional 10 minutes for the chips and salsa to arrive at our table which were a half order at best and another 10 minutes for our appetizers to arrive. The server at no time apologized for the amount of time it took for our initial food items to arrive. When our meals arrived we were not pleased as the portion sizes were drastically smaller than the location that we frequent at home. Lastly, the floors were extremely slippery and had the consistency of a kitchen floor doused in grease. The bathrooms were in no better condition and also had the same slippery floor. I am very disappointed in this location as it did not live up to the Fridays expectation. I would steer clear of this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manahawkin,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
