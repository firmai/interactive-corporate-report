In the middle of the meal I remember why I swore it off all those years ago. The food is just the most bland food ever. I had a 'Shroom Burger. The burger was less than mediocre and the mushrooms were flavorless.

Fish and Chips:  fries as expected were spot on. Plate was sent incomplete, missing a piece of cod which was delivered 2-5 minutes later, and was good as well.

37,Dave R.,"Boise, ID",14,33,2.0,1.0,2013-09-03,"If your in Boise ID. you should avoid this Red Robin and visit the other locations on Milwaukee or Eagle. In the last year I visited this Red Robin's twice and after bad encounters with the service back to back, I will never return to this location. The food has been mediocre both visits and servers seem to have issues with more than two tables. The food does not equal the quality of any of the other Red Robin's from Boise to Caldwell. Both visits fell short on all of chain restaurants standards. The first and second visit started with a horrible greeting from the host. The most recent visit (today, Sept. 2nd) I walked in to be ignored by the host, she was busy flirting with the carpenter and they were not talking about his carpenter project. I was given no ""Hi"" or ""Welcome to Red Robin,"" I had to initiate the short conversation to ask where to pick up my food. She pointed to the bar, to which, no one was at the bar. The restaurant was dead, so I don't believe this girl had any excuses to be short with me. It also didn't excuse her from not greeting me at all. Isn't this the reason to have a host stand at the front door?  Last fall my girlfriend and I went in to grab a bite to eat on our day off. When we were sat we asked for a window seat to see the lake, which seemed to be a burden for this person. I guess this was excused because the restaurant was completely empty of customers at the time. The server eventually came over to greet us to get our drinks and seemed to forget our existence when another table came in. This other table was a six top so he was excused to not take our order or bring our drinks back. The manager had to ask if we had been helped and had to finish out our dining experience. I understand getting a bigger table can be challenging, but completely ignoring of forgetting a table is inexcusable.  If your in Boise and fancy a burger, head anywhere besides the Parkcenter Red Robin. You could also try Big Jud's or Boise Fry Company (bison burger and a ton of variations of fries) where you will have a great dining experience with a local restaurant :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

The service is always great (and I eat here a few times a year), and it's a cool location by the lake. They have a decent beer menu (always a few micro brews, and I'm not talking about blue moon).

30,Kamile I.,"Boise, ID",2,4,1.0,1.0,2015-06-21,"Hardly a one star experience. There are a number of reasons that contributed to the overall negative experience today which truly surprised me because I've always been pleased with my visits. The customer service was not up to par with your brand and here is what I noted on my visit: 1. We waited for 10 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us, but she was nowhere insight. Keep in mind the restaurant did not appear busy. Upon greeting the table Kelsey asked if we were ready to order food. No drinks were at the table yet and she took the napkins and silverware away at this time. She seemed irritated we wanted to get a drink of water. 2. Waters were dropped off and slide to each person. I was looking down at my phone and was surprised that suddenly a large glass was in front of me. I guess I should have been ready for that, luckily it didn't hit me in the face. 3. Food arrived at the table, dropped off by a kitchen assistance or hot food runner. His apparel looked like he was a cook as he had on a black chef coat and hairnet. Two of the four meals were given to us incorrectly than what we had requested. Small things like having the bbq sauce of the whiskey burger on the side and an extra side of buzzard sauce were looked over- not complicated requests. We also didn't have utensils or napkins. So we requested the sauces and table settings and were told that he would get someone to bring us those things. It seemed like we were halfway through eating when they finally arrived to the table.  4. As we ate I observed other tables she was helping. One table got their tab and the receipt had the incorrect food charged to the customer, Kelsey didn't seem thrilled about needing to correct the charges. I noted this same table request sides and not get them for a long period of time. Another table also waited for a long while to be greeted and served beverages. The third table who appeared to be engaging with Kelsey, chatting up her cute new belt buckle, all appeared to be having a nice time. Their food arrived and I observed the front host who seated us had set down a tray of food for their table. He picked up the first plate, got some sauce on his hand, then while holding the plate proceeded to lick his hand, then served the table the dish. I was disgusted. The parents backs were toward the host so there would have been no way they could have seen it unless they turned around. 5. I asked for the tab, and confirmed that we need it on one check. She brought the cards back, because we split the tab and dropped it at the table and left in a hurry. Clearly friendly and happy to have us. We opened the check book only to find our cards, the receipts soaking wet, and an ice cube (I guess for dessert?). So after filling out our soggy receipt we departed.  The craziest part about it was that two male managers appeared to be working, wearing normal clothes. How does this happen with not one but two managers on staff?  I would say that Kelsey did keep our water glasses filled and the food was good.  I'm saddened to say I likely won't visit this Red Robin again. I worked as a server for 6 years and am a previous employee of Red Robin. It's disheartening to see a lack of customer service at an establishment I once worked at.  I do hope this feedback gets back to the team and you are able to take this as constructive to work on your cleanliness and customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

38,Stacie F.,"Boise, ID",0,5,,1.0,2015-07-25,"Stopped into Red Robin with some als after a memorial service and ordered a hamburger. I specifically asked for the meat patty to be on a separate plate because I don't eat meat and one of my friends wanted extra. I got my order and it came with the meat patty on it. I explained to the waitress my allergy and she took it back so it could be fixed. No big deal. Happens a lot anywhere I go, so I'm pretty patient. When she brought it back, the cooks literally just took the patty off the bun, stuck the patty on the plate, without replacing the rest of them items that the patty had touched. I ended up not being able to eat it and still paid the ten dollars for my meal. A bun cost like what, fifty cents max? The veggies maybe another fifty cents and same with the cheese?  Due to the laziness and lack of consideration to my needs as a paying customer, which I think were fairly reasonable and simple, I will never go back to this restaurant and probably other Red Robin franchises, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

And this RR is no different; fantastic food and service. What makes THIS Red Robin (Parkcenter Blvd.) even better is the inside -the atmosphere. I'm a natural-light kind of guy. I prefer that over fluorescent lights overhead. This RR has almost ALL natural light. On warm days you can eat outside on the patio, or stay inside and still be bathed in sunlight (during the hot days the AC is blowing so you wont get the sting of sunlight on your skin). Half of the restaurant is encased in large wall-windows. I love it. And the view of the lake isn't half bad either. We've had great service every time we have gone there.  And because you are in Boise State nation, there are plenty of wall decorations and autographs memorializing past BSU football glory. This RR is the best one I've been to and whenever we are in the Boise area, we ALWAYS hit this before we skate back to Twin Falls. BTW, as you can tell, my ""photo"" is merely a screenshot of RR via Google Maps. But it shows the large wall windows I was describing.

15,Gabrielle M.,"Boise, ID",0,50,,2.0,2016-10-15,"This is a sad story about a restaurant that used to be great and everyone in Boise loved it, but that all changed when the management/ownership decided to let quality and service training slide. The concept was fresh, 30 years ago. The restaurant is nearly identical to what it was back then. The service today was slow. Our waitress forgot to ask me what salad dressing I wanted and instead of coming back to ask me, she just gave me ranch. But I couldn't eat my salad because she forgot to bring silverware. We asked twice then observed her taking drinks out, then sauces out to other tables whilst our food got cold. My husbands salad came out 10 minutes in to our entree meal w/no apologies.  We used to love this place but I don't think we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
7,Alex U.,"American Falls, ID",5,101,8.0,3.0,2016-10-19,"I went there with my wife and 2 kids.The good part they looked pretty crowded and yet we were seated right away.   Another good part is they do serve beer(not everyone does in this part of good old US of A ).   Good part : prices .   Bad part : sizes. I think I ordered whiskey river bbq burger and if it will be the only thing I ate , I would have to leave hungry.   Their incentive program is also way complicated and demands too much of a personal information.    I also liked bottomless coleslaw option.So overall not particularly impressed , but not discouraged from future visits it adds some diversity to Poky's burger options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

It took about 20 minutes to get our order in but at least our server was apologetic. the food was decent. the sweet potatoe fries were old but I was happy they had them at least. I would say this visit was just okay. I will probably go there again but there are quite a few restaurants in town I prefer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
2,John S.,"Boise, ID",131,387,871.0,3.0,2016-11-11,"I'm kind of so-so with Red Robin. They have a great selection of burgers with many different toppings. I like the creativity of their research and development arm but it seems like the fillings are meant to cover up for the bland hamburgers themselves. The burger had the appearance of a pre-formed, possibly frozen burger like those from the place with the golden arches. Only the size of the burger leaned more toward the size of a Quarter Pounder than the 10-to-one pound regular burgers of the other place. However, it didn't appear the Chop House burger I ordered had any seasoning added to it. By itself, it was pretty bland. Lucky it came with onion straws, mushrooms and some kind of Dijon sauce. It also came with steak sauce, but fearing the worst, I asked for it on the side. Thank goodness. There's no better way to ruin a perfectly good guitar, errr, steak or hamburger by masking it with steak sauce. I dipped a French fry into it and nearly keeled over. It was awful. I was seated at a table in the bar, which meant the bartender had to tend with me, three or four other tables, plus several people seated at the bar. He spent about two seconds every time he sort of stopped at my table. Did more of a ""is everything ok,"" ""do you need some more water,"" ""can I get you some more fries,"" on the fly.  Red Robin is typically busy and this lunchtime was no exception. While my server was friendly at each short encounter, I noticed two other servers and what I assumed was some sort of manager tight-lipped the entire time. They didn't appear friendly to customers or workers alike. I was glad I wasn't in their areas, even though I was close enough to observe them. I enjoyed watching the couple seated around the corner from me. They didn't say five words during the entire meal. They were both too busy texting. Guess they should have gone out for lunch with the people on the other end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
14,Kat S.,"Boise, ID",42,2,,5.0,2016-11-30,"So Red Robin is a corporate establishment, which means the food is going to be consistently good unless they're doing something very wrong, and the food was great. What you can't always count on is service, especially when you have a small human in tow. I went today with my little and we had an absolute blast, from our hostess to our waiter, top fricken notch! Also they had great deals on food from the pub menu, and were so sweet to offer side options of baby friendly foods. They were attentive and astute, we will be back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

Did not leave a tip. Manager not accountable for squat. Was absolutely AWOL during the evening and should be fired.

Food was average. Mac n cheese was served cold with about 5 fries.  Ice water tastes like it came out of the toilet.

Seated at a 2top booth in the raised bar area. Feet stuck to the ground. Went to second and third booth in same area, the table top were sticky with a built up ""stuff"" on them. Moving on, we can't sit at the bar, not clean, with other customers dinner ware left behind. On to the high table by the window, appears clean, but after 2-3 minutes, forearms are sticking to table.  That's it, off to Freddie's. Quick service, clean table.

I had a mai Thai and it was good. The patron margarita was a little too sweet for my liking. My friend found the plastic tie from a plastic bag in his salad but I understand things happen and they took it off the bill so it wasn't the biggest deal. Our server was super sweet and fast. I think this place is very kid friendly and would be fun for a birthday dinner.
