17,Shane A.,"High Point, NC",466,340,313.0,2.0,2012-04-30,"Went to this location on Saturday night around 8PM and they were packed.  We sat at the bar because we had been running around town all day and were literally starving.   I ordered the chicken and shrimp that's on the 2 for $20 menu without cheese, mushrooms and onions.  It came out burnt and with a few onions.  I think they put onions on it and then scrapped them off. I sent it back, and in about 5 mins another arrived.  This time it wasn't burnt, however it had cheese, mushrooms and onions on it once again.   The manager came over and literally said to me, ""uh-oh, I see a yucky face, what's wrong?""  I explained and so did the waitress and he tried to make it right.  He got me another one, this time, correct, however the person with me had to enjoy a cold meal as they had waited on me so long to get my food. They took my meal off the bill.  ($8.00) and we paid the other $12.00.  In my opinion they should have offered something else, free dessert, gift card, etc....  I mean, why don't people think of that when a meal comes out incorrect? From now on I think when this happens I will send the entire meal back, my plate as well as others in the party.  Then I think restaurants will get the idea that you really should cook to order specifications. Were they nice about it?  Yeah, somewhat? Did they go above and beyond to please the customer on their mistake??  NO Would I come back??  Possibly, if I were starving, however, the food isn't that good and neither is the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
14,Karen S.,"Kernersville, NC",218,408,571.0,3.0,2012-07-08,"We had a nice lunch on the way back from the beach.  It appears Applebees is revamping itself as more ""upscale"" kind of like Ruby Tuesdays is now doing.They are tring to class it up a bit with an extended menu of everything- food, drinks and desserts.   It was decorated like a sports bar and had a lot of nice TVs. My husband commented he would like to watch a game there. Menu was HUGE- I had the seasonal shrimp/spinach salad and it was good. My husband enjoyed the Cowboy burger.  We also had an order of onion rings as an appetizer that was HUGE!  Service from the the bar was nice as well. I'd go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
16,Neil F.,"Narberth, PA",36,65,2.0,1.0,2013-04-21,"We were seated immediately and greatest by our waitress. She said: ""hi, my name is... What are your names?  I know it is designed as a personal touch but I found it offensive. The food at Applebee's is mediocre. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
15,Amanda S.,"Jamestown, NC",1,13,3.0,3.0,2014-06-22,"The last time i went the people were so considerate and nice. But  They got mine and one of family members plate wrong but they were so sorry about it, which meant a lot to me. Some restaurants will just be like""oops my bad."" I've been here tons of times before and it was perfect, but i believe that one bad service doesn't tamper the restaurant's reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
18,Bob B.,"Jamestown, NC",0,14,2.0,2.0,2014-10-11,"Based on food alone this would have been at best a one-star rating.  Service, however, was very good, therefore, the 2 stars.  I arrived at about 7:00PM and ordered a Red Oak on draft, a side salad, and a ""cowboy"" burger with french fries.  The beer was cold and brought to my table soon after ordering.  The side salad was nearly a meal in itself and was good.  Then the arrival of the burger.  I ordered it well done (no pink) and the onion ""straws"" (or ""strings"") on the side.  About half the burger was well done; the other half, a pinkish red on the inside.  It was charcoal black in places on the outside.  No fries on the plate even though it showed on the order.  The onion ""straws"" (or ""strings"") were drenched in grease and not edible.  The server agreed completely and told me she wouldn't eat them either.  It was very obvious the cook showed absolutely no pride in his or her work; just throw it on the plate regardless of how it looked or tasted.  There was also a change in hamburger buns from the last time I ate a burger at Applebee's and the change was not a good one.  It is highly unlikely I will return to this restaurant and will share my experience with others, as well.  This was definitely one of the worst meals I've had in a long time!  Both the server and the manager on duty were informed of my dissatisfaction with the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
7,Damien P.,"Lyon, France",55,137,446.0,2.0,2014-10-20,"My colleagues told me that the chain was in troubles; they are apparently too pricy and it's not that tasty. Well, I confirm. More than $10 for chicken tenders, with only few fries on the side, that's not cheap indeed. And they were no better than some you can find around. You can feel that the company management has just no clue at what they are doing. Instead of focusing on the basics - you know those crazy ideas to offer good food and a friendly service - they instead bought tablets for each table to order appetizers and drinks.  Not sure it will improve their situation...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,

10,Sean T.,"High Point, NC",0,24,,1.0,2015-04-16,I use to love this place. Seldom go now because they did away with the baked potato. Nothing goes better with a steak. I go to Longhorn mostly now. Too bad I like Applebee's Steak and Shrimp Parmesan but not enough to put up with their potato choices. I complained but they acted like big deal. If they don't listen to customers then they are the ones to suffer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
0,Matthew R.,"Greensboro, NC",41,48,16.0,3.0,2015-06-05,"I have to be honest, I don't go to Applebee's a whole lot. But when I went the other day with my friend, I ended up feeling about the same way about it as I normally do. The service here was good, and our waiter was on top of everything he needed to do.  The problem that I normally have is that Applebee's just doesn't have the best food around. They do a fairly good job with the atmosphere and the service, but the food always leaves me feeling like there could've been more bang for my buck. I think Applebee's is a good place to go with friends and have a meal, but you might be able to get a better meal elsewhere. Applebee's is getting closer to being great as time goes on, they're just not quite there yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,

1,Stephanie H.,"Trinity, NC",88,341,325.0,2.0,2015-12-15,"The menu has improved a lot and I have no problem with the food at Applebee's.  I really enjoyed the salsa verde nachos and the sweet potato fries.  The service at this location is painfully slow.  Not unfriendly...just really slow.  Our drinks ran out constantly and our server was usually nowhere in sight.  When we requested something, it took forever for her to provide. The 3 hostesses were all standing at the front door when we arrived and they had to bus a table for us to sit down.  That took 8 minutes.  Halfway through our meal, when the group in the booth behind us left, their table remained un-bused for almost 45 minutes.  In spite of the food being decent, the meal took forever.  Our appetizer of sweet potato fries didn't arrive at the table until 20 minutes after we ordered it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,

4,Pam C.,"Hillsborough, NC",0,5,,2.0,2016-02-29,"My two stars are for the very nice waitress . Otherwise, my overall experience was atrocious! First of all, my party of 6 had to wait for over 40 minutes to be seated because ""the cook isn't here yet"" as we were told. Whaaatt??? Well, it would have been better if the cook had never arrived! I can only speak to what I ordered. My coke and my coleslaw (in a tiny cup, by the way) were fine although the small amount of coleslaw was ridiculous. I mean... really??? But this isn't the worst part. The baby back ribs were so overdone that seriously, I felt like I was eating roadkill! The so-called honey barbecue ""sauce"" had a nice taste but was literally burned onto the ribs so there was no flow of sauce to speak of. I ordered mashed potatoes instead of fries. It was a nice size serving but oh my, it tasted like paste!  To top off my terrible entree and mashed potatoes, I have never been to a dirtier ladies room! When I walked in, another patron was searching the stalls for toilet paper. She noted that most of the toilets wouldn't flush. YUK! Both the floor and sink were also dirty! Don't even consider going to this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
9,Nick D.,"Greensboro, NC",50,50,20.0,2.0,2016-04-18,"My experience here was one unlike any other. I know that good restaurants are delivering quality food with good service in a nice environment from opening to closing. Regardless of when I came here I received poor food, annoyingly awful service and a loud environment. One of my peers I ate with had a dish that is supposed to be a pasta and chicken meal that lacked a substantial amount of chicken. Being unsure of how the food is I got the chicken tenders platter because I couldn't think of anyone stupid and incompetent enough to screw that up. I'm not saying they have someone as brainless as a North Korean but damn those chicken tenders sucked! I honestly could have made better ones at home with a crab pinching my left nut. The server mixed up our order and gave me a fajita meal which made me so confused I mean how does someone mix up chicken tenders and f**kin fajitas. It also took forever to get our food. I will say however the mozzarella sucks were awesome. The environment is a sports theme with tons of TVs and a huge bar. I would go here again if I had a flat tire and needed some place to stay out of the cold at 12:00 at night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
5,Muranda D.,"Greensboro, NC",9,139,,2.0,2016-09-05,"My experience at this location was pretty odd.  It wasn't my first choice to go here, and not even my second, but on the day I was looking to have dinner out, part of Greensboro/High Point was shut down, due to the Ebola contamination scare.  At any rate, there wasn't a wait- we were seated right when we walked in.  We ordered the pretzels with the blue moon dip as an appetizer.  This is something I've had many times before, because it was a long time favorite of mine.  My first sample of the dip was less than favorable.  My prior experiences with this dip have always had a thick, creamy consistency.  This one was almost watered down- very thin and runny.  It didn't even have a similar taste as the dip I usually love.  This was like some kind of strange queso knock-off.  Anyways, we ordered our food- I ordered a chicken quesadilla with ranch.  After I placed my order, the server makes some super awkward comment about how I ""must have worked in the service industry if I want to drown my food in ranch, so you can't taste the real thing."" Uh.. are you serious?  What kind of thing is that to say about a place that you work for?  You've literally just told me that even you think the food is not good.  Throughout our visit, he kept coming back saying odd things.  For the most part I think he was trying to be nice and make conversation, but it felt really forced. When our food came out my quesadilla looked nothing like it normally does.  This dish at one point was served on an entree plate with a generous amount of quesadillas.  The dish I was served was on an appetizer plate (I specifically mentioned that I wanted the dinner portion of the dish when I made my initial order.)  Also, it tasted like something was missing, but I couldn't figure out exactly what it was.  Towards the end of my meal, the server returns to drop another bit of genuis sentiment.  He says to me, ""next time you come in, you should order this dish with bacon!"" I said, ""I thought the dish came with bacon? also in a much larger serving?""  He responds with, ""Oh yeah, our menu changed."" If he had such wonderful advice, why on Earth did he not mention this to me while I was placing my order?  I was a server and a bartender for a long time, and it's always customary to try and upsale your orders, and adding bacon would do just that.  I would have gladly paid for it, if I was aware of menu changes. All in all, it was not a good experience.  The kitchen seemed out of sorts, with their shotty food and my server was out of his mind.  I'm not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,

Everyone seemed nice and we got seated right away. Not a single problem. When we go there again well deffinatly ask for him! There macaroni should have more cheese on it though I didnt taste it.

We figured they had to make the beer...lol We finally got our beer in bottles and we got done with the beers before the appetizers came. He got the order wrong and we had to wait even longer.... Appetizers were suppose to be half off after 10 pm.  We didn't get our appetizers until after 10 and they wouldn't give us the half price... terrible service! !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-high-point-4,,,,,
