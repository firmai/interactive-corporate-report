Jozef S.,"Canton, MI",6,6,7,3.0,1/14/2018,Noice levels loud as hell. Not TVs people! Food. It was just ok. It was kind of quick. But taste of the food seems to blend together. Like if you had one they all taste the same. Anyways. Maybe this place can wait a month or two to come back to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland
E H.,"Ypsilanti, MI",1,12,,2.0,7/29/2017,I usually have great experiences when I visit Red Robin in its various locations. This was the exception. French onion soup was bland (tasted watered down) and the onions had not been properly caramelized leaving them crunchy and flavorless. Main dishes were as expected although the ingredients in the salad seemed less than fresh especially the avocado which was browning as opposed to the normally bright green you see.  Miranda our server was either new or simply not very great at her job. Not only did she fail to offer one of us a beverage refill but forgot to bring the garlic bread with the salad and never offered a refill on the bottomless fries until after it was obvious we were finished with the meal. She was MIA to us through most of our meal but could be observed hanging out with other staff by the serving station (beverages) or clearing off tables that already had staff working on them. It was not a particularly busy time so this was a bit frustrating. The establishment itself was very nice on the surface. Upon closer examination our booth had lots of crumbs in the crease between the back rest and the seat. The salt and pepper grinders were disgustingly filthy with old food residue caked all over them. This was the similar situation with the ketchup on the table. Our menus also looked as if they had not been wiped down in quite some time.  We will probably not revisit the location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland
Amanda K.,"Dearborn, MI",17,117,37,5.0,12/31/2017,"Our waitress, Renee, is very well-versed in what is veg friendly and what isn't. Just an FYI, the barbecue sauce has anchovies in it. The teriyaki is vegan. They have a veggie burger which is better than your average Morningstar special, as well as Boca patties which can be substituted into other burgers. The screaming red zombie drink is tasty and packs a bit of a punch with the mix of rums, so plan accordingly. It's not too strong, but it is a zombie. Veg friends, enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland
Lorenza T.,"Southfield, MI",1,43,17,2.0,11/25/2017,"Red Robin has really fallen off of their game! You can get a burger anywhere.....first you change your menu! Why? You increase your prices. Why? I've visited RR all over the country and the locations here in Michigan are kinda SAD in comparison. I must say that the staff tries extremely hard but things just don't seem to be the same. I don't really want to pick on specific locations but most in Metro Detroit are suffering bad! You CAN'T charge top dollar for a subpar product. The ambiance isn't that inviting so what's keeping from getting a neighborhood bar-burger and sitting in the comforts of my home? $13-$15 for a burger is ridiculous. Maybe I'm a little hard on you guys, but my family loves you so I guess we will keep coming back. I can say that I really did enjoy my most recent meal here......too bad it wasn't a burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland

Dave S.,"Monroe, MI",127,222,399,3.0,8/15/2017,Had the Blue ribbon burger which was really good but I swear the portion size of the burgers have gone down since I was last at a Red Robin several years ago but I guess that's why the do bottom less fries.  Not sure why this place has such a low rating we had good friendly service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland

Angela S.,"Westland, MI",77,119,386,4.0,3/5/2017,"Pretty good stop for lunch on a Saturday afternoon... The hubby and I were out shopping and stopped in for lunch. There were a few patrons already waiting in the lobby when we arrived. We were greeted right away, our name was placed on the list and we were told the wait would be 10 minutes or less.  In less than 10, we were escorted up a (very) short flight of stairs to the bar area which was labeled 21 and up. I liked this because the restaurant is very kid and family oriented for the most part but this creates an area away from the buzz.  Our server came immediately and took our drink orders - ""freckled"" lemonades blended with frozen strawberries (Yum!). We skipped apps although there were plenty to choose from and ventured away from the burgers which are always good. My hubby ordered the fish and chips while I went for the new Salmon Harrisa citrus salmon (double Yum)!. This sandwich was a masterpiece complete with arugula, tomato and topped with tempura lemon wedge and roasted red pepper garlic aoli. It was by far one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and I'm planning in my head when I can go and have it again!  We can confirm that this burger joint does more than just burgers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland
Mike S.,"Belleville, MI",33,103,374,2.0,12/28/2016,"Another meh joint. I really think I'm becoming disenchanted with all chain restaurants. All of my favorite meals of late have been from one off places. Westland is light on these joints so, in the absence of individuality - Red Robin had to do on this day. The service here was great. The hostess and our waiter were both really friendly. Almost fakley so. Is fakely a word? Who cares, it is now. Anyway, despite being way more interested in my day than I was in theirs they were both out to provide 11 point customer service on a 10 point scale. The food at Red Robin used to be some of my favorite. It's been a while since I've been to one and I left today less than impressed. The salad I had could of had a lot fresher veggies, my old ladies soup was luke warm, the burger patties have lost some weight since the last time I was here and both were prepared not as requested by us. I was also asked by the misses to let everyone know that the women's restroom was disgusting. She's been camping, she's been to the Hoedown, she's been to Mexico so trust that if she makes it a point to tell me the bathroom is nasty, that shit's nasty. I really wish I could rate this place higher but despite it being reasonably priced (which I really could care less about) I will probably go somewhere else next time I'm in the Wasteland/Garbage City area, I would suggest you do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland

But sadly if we sit at the high tops we are served by antonio who frankly, is not a very good server.

Paul W.,"Westland, MI",80,45,4,4.0,6/4/2017,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in a while, not much of a burger guy. However, my friend has never been and he loves burgers so I brought him in. The restaurant was clean, we waited briefly before a human tornado came, greeted, and sat us. I seriously don't think he actually stopped at my table for more than 2 seconds. That being said, we couldn't have had better service. I ordered the grilled turkey burger, friend got the DGB - both were cooked exactly as requested. Only complaint on food quality is he requested the burger medium and the bottom of his bun was incredibly soggy, most likely due to the sauce on the bottom of the bun when it probably should be on top. But, it wasn't serious and he still loved it. Restroom needed some attention, looked like it hadn't been picked up in a while. Not having been here in a while I was very happy with my visit and I'm definitely more likely to return. Gerald, our server, was amazing. This guy works too damn hard for being a server, but as he stated, he's been 9 years and that's for a reason. He had 4 tables to another server's 2 and he was running circles around that bitch - normally I don't get vulgar in reviews but holy shit this guy is good. Even though he literally was hi and bye at each stop, he had a smile on his face the entire time and you knew he was genuinely focused on you. If you come here, request him. It would be worth any wait - he'll take care of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland

Mike A.,"Plymouth, MI",77,90,19,4.0,5/26/2016,"Went here with my boy Scotty 2 Hotty after a Tiger's game. Went to a day game in the D, sat through about an hour of traffic in my drop top in the scorching heat, dying for some good food after a tough Tigers loss, and a worse Casino loss.  We got to Red Robin, and were seated quickly in the nicely air conditioned bar area. Services was great and prompt, and with a smile. Just how I like it. I got the gourmet cheese burger, medium well, no tomato, no relish and with american cheese. My order was served as ordered, and my beer with served in a giant frozen mug! Definitely hit the spot after my day of being a bum.  My ONLY gripe about our experience, was that our waitress never provided either of us with silverware. We didn't get anything that generally requires silverware, but my home boy likes to eat burgers with silverware for some reason, so I was sad to see him struggle eating with only a knife.

Harold W.,"Grand Haven, MI",5,91,78,2.0,7/6/2017,Red Robin burgers are hit or miss...

My mother asked for soup and never got it, when the food came my mom said to just take it off the bill and she didn't offer anything to fix it. The chicken teriyaki burger and fries were delicious.

On our most recent visit, I went with the Royal Burger and it was excellent. The fried egg just added a little bit of decadence to the otherwise good and tasty burger. The wife had the Ra-gin Cajun Burger with equal pleasure. The bottomless fries came out in a stand up ring, which held the fries at attention for easier snatching and dipping.

Ben S.,"Detroit, MI",38,241,30,4.0,1/5/2014,"Went here last night for the first time ever. The parking lot always seems to be packed but I was hungry and with my bad ass wife. So we pulled in and gave it a shot.  The place felt packed and I honestly didn't see any open tables. However we were seated in less than ten minutes. Cool.  Our waitress was very nice, attentive and checked in on us even with all her other tables. If you've never been the menu consists of American food and mostly sandwiches, burgers & salads. Just from the first glance of the menu I knew I was in for a treat.  They've got a good deal on appetizers so we went with the chips, salsa & guac. Chips tasted freshly made, perfectly salted and the salsa & guac were nicely flavored. They even gave us some extra chips! For dinner I got the complete opposite of anything I'd usually order. I went for a chicken spinach wrap & a fruit bowl. Yeah I know, not the manliest order. In fact the girl that dropped it off almost gave it to my wife.  It was worth it though. The taste was there, the wrap was hot and every bite better than the last. Bottomless fruit bowl was delicious.

John W.,"Dearborn, MI",2,12,,1.0,3/26/2016,We have eaten here several times. Burgers are OK and the fries are usually good. Something has changed. Service sucked. The fries were dark and overcooked. I think the fryer oil is long overdue to be changed (the fries other tables were getting looked just as bad). My wife ordered a side of broccoli which she never received. Waitress did not come around for quite awhile so we never got a chance to bring up the problems as she was just there to drop off the bill.

Becki B.,"Lake Orion, MI",196,395,136,5.0,2/16/2011,"I don't usually review a lot of chain restaurants, but tonight was exceptional.  My daughter has been fighting a cold, so after she braved a couple of stops we had to make at stores, I asked her what she wanted for dinner. I expected her answer to be 'McDonald's' (pretty typical favorite for a three-year-old), but she surprised me by saying Red Robin, and not even changing her mind when I asked her a few more times during our errands.  So Red Robin it was! Our waiter, Gerald, really made the night. He waited for my daughter to say 'Please' for her macaroni and cheese and oranges, and even got her another lemonade after she sucked the first glass down in record time. Getting a balloon was one of the things she remembered from past visits, and she was not disappointed this time. She even got a yellow one like she had planned to request. I've had a hankering lately for salads with little nutritional value, so I totally loved my fried chicken salad (and I love the fact that I can get a smaller size for a little less cash, since I never finish anyway). Gerald was a true professional. As we finished our meal, he stopped by to say again that he appreciated us coming in, and said he's always there, so when we come back we should ask for him.

Ben K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,62,,2.0,8/7/2014,"Okay, so this review is pretty biased. As a (mostly) vegetarian, burger places can be tricky. The thing that really gets me is that there are lots of really good veggie burger option (e.g. my favorite burger place makes a quinoa burger that is delicious). I don't understand why a restaurant would serve frozen processed burgers (and then sell them for $9 when the patties cost a buck at the super market).  Other than that, it is okay, and there aren't that many good food options in that area anyhow.

Barring a few dalliances with the various salads during my Atkins phase, my mainstay this whole time has been the Bleu Ribbon Burger, always cooked a perfect medium. The flavor combo just fires on all cylinders for me.  I am about to drool right now.   We have never had to wait very long for a seat or a meal, the prices are fair (although quite a bit higher than way-back-when), and the service is always at least ok.  I won't say we have never had a bad incident, but right now I can't recall one.   Another convert to the smoke-free idea, Red Robin now lets you walk out just smelling like a grill instead of an ashtray.  It was weird the first time they seated us in the bar area.  I hope that someday a state law will make this particular criteria obsolete - until then it is gladly on my list of smoke-free faves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland?start=40
John M.,"Canton, MI",0,3,1,4.0,7/8/2014,"We've been fans of Red Robin since the early 1980s (out in the Seattle area), and when we moved to Michigan in 2000 were *thrilled* to find this Westland Red Robin.  The chain has grown over the years, and the chain has changed quite a bit in just the last few years.  It seems they are trying to appear more upscale to compete with the ever expanding competition for a good burger.  Frankly, I wish they would just focus us on serving the best burgers possible versus trying to appear fancier.   On the positive side, there are now three sizes of burgers available, but our family found the menu layout confusing and it took a while before we realized this fact.   The number one thing to know about Red Robin (any of them) is that most of the burgers are heavily dressed with innovative and tasty toppings.  That said, purists who are focused on the beef patty itself may be disappointed.  The beef patties are good, but not great - Red Robin is about the toppings as much as anything.   Great family atmosphere.  Service is generally very good.   We used to love the ""Mach Nachos"", but the nacho appetizer was revamped a few years back.  The new incarnation is much smaller, although each individual chip is loaded with its own stack of nacho toppings.  As much I appreciate the effort to create a perfect experience with each chip, it just needs to be bigger.   All in all, we continue to love Red Robin, and it remains one of the kids' absolute favorites.  The Westland location generally does a good job upholding expectations for the chain.  It costs more than it used to, but the Banzai Burger and Royal burgers are still there, the steak fries are still bottomless, and the atmosphere still fun and kid friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland?start=40

I should have gone to Burger King instead. At least I know the Whopper is decent. The service sucks as the waiter forgot to put in our order for onion rings. I ordered the BBQ burger and was severely disappointed. My philosophy with a burger is that you should not have to put so many toppings on the burger to make it taste good. The toppings should only add to the flavor of an already-tasty beef patty.  In my opinion, Red Robin burgers do just the opposite. They try to add tons of mayo, cheese, and other toppings to cover up the mediocre burger.  I will not be returning. Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland?start=40

Mel T.,"Canton, MI",0,25,,1.0,7/13/2015,"First off, let me state that I have nothing against Red Robin the restaurant chain. I absolutely LOVE Red Robin burgers and fries, and their salads are just as delicious. I have been eating Red Robin food for about ten years, and I never get tired of it. But this location... I am so fed up with these people. My husband and I were regulars here for a few years. We're common restaurant-goers who tip very well if everything goes smoothly and we're treated well enough. For a while, we loved the place. Servers were upbeat and friendly (for the most part), they listened to us and they seemed to care. I never had complaints about my food for a long time, and neither did my husband. We were huge fans of this location for long time. And then... the quality of service suddenly took a nosedive. On some nights we would order take-out. In fact, we visited Red Robin so often that I got a Royalty Card. Before, we didn't even have issues with the take-out service. Everything was top notch. But suddenly, I noticed that someone who commonly answered the phone to take our order had an attitude problem. She made it clear not only in her tone, but her responses, that she didn't give a single damn about my order, or if it was right or wrong. She made it obvious that she didn't like working there, that she didn't want to serve anyone, and she hated everything about it. Whenever someone would begin speaking to me, I would greet them with an upbeat tone, and it usually fell flat whenever this girl spoke to me. She sounded so miserable and fed up with everything. Sure enough... what starts happening to us? Our orders start coming to us incorrect. We had to start making a habit of checking our food before leaving, because she/they would always get it wrong, and they would leave stuff out of the order that I requested (nothing complicated. Just ""a couple sides of ranch please.""). It began to irritate us beyond comprehension. We stopped ordering take-out from there, and we gave the restaurant one more chance and dined in for the last time. Oh. My. God. Was it bad. First of all, they were a little busy that evening, but I never consider that a good excuse. We've dined in at busy Red Robins before, and we've NEVER, EVER had problems like the ones we were about to experience-- even with a full house. Our orders are never complicated when we pay Red Robin a visit. Almost every time, I order a Burnin' Love burger. Medium-well. Simple as that. My husband orders a Keep it Simple burger-- two patties (what they call ""Monster"" sized), just meat and a bun. No sides or condiments. Simple. Right? Apparently... no. To them, it was rocket science. That fateful final night, we were put off immediately by having to wait almost thirty minutes to be seen by any of the wait staff. As I said, we've been in busy restaurants (including Red Robin) before and were never forced to wait that long. By the time we were seen, it was by a waitress, who had... surprisingly... an attitude problem. Who is hiring these spiteful women who treat people like crap? She passes our table, doesn't even look at us, throws napkins down on our table and doesn't say a word while she addresses the table behind us. This already got us a little steamed. She walked past us again... once more not saying anything while we waited and waited... and waited to be served, or even SPOKEN to. By the time she did serve us... thirty minutes after we were seated... she, like the girl on the phone, made it pretty clear she hated her job, her life, and whatever other problems she brought to work with her. She was dismissive, short, uncaring. She barely said anything, and when she did, it was in an aloof manner. We waited thirty minutes to be treated like crap. We make our order very clear to her. A monkey could understand it. I have no idea what she wrote on her notepad... but I guarantee it was NOT what we told her. When our food came back... I think another twenty minutes later... our stomachs are aching from hunger. When it arrives... we're shocked. My husband's order was nothing close to what he asked for. It was a chicken sandwich. Plain. Not a burger, like what he asked for as plain as day. Chicken. He never said the word ""chicken"" to this girl... not once. Now angry, he sends the very wrong order back, asking for the correct one. By the time my husband receives his SECOND order, it has been an HOUR since we arrived. A whole hour! When they bring it to him... guess what? It's wrong again. The burger has one patty, and not two. At this point, we're so frustrated that we tell them to forget fixing it and to just bring us the damn check. The waitress who served us, the one with the attitude, is NOW paying attention to what we're saying, now that we're upset. Never coming back. (Not to sound sexist... but for some reason, the men here are nicer than the women. They're always cheerful and happy to serve. Maybe the women are treated poorly here?)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland?start=20
Don K.,"Westland, MI",23,177,47,3.0,6/21/2016,"I really like the remodel that continues to take place. I hoe that staff training continues to take place. As a restaurant veteran of 35+ years it kills me to not hear suggestive selling taking place. But as much as this hurts it really bothers me when a server can't describe a menu item and make it enticing.  I asked about a burger with brat special and was told ""it's okay if you like that sort of thing, I haven't tried it"" We both ordered the French onion soup and a sandwich. The soup had great flavor but was lukewarm. We were informed after quite awhile that the first set burnt in the oven, French onion, and they were being remade. Then not two slurps into the soup once served they set our sandwiches down. Same thing that happened at another RR in the area. The mgr happened to come by asking if all was okay and I told her no. I didn't appreciate having both my starter and my meal served at roughly the same time. She offered to take them back and have them remade which was done. While I did like the cheesy beer brat I think it should be served on a plate instead of a wire basket. It has a great taste but very messy to eat with the different sauces getting on your hands with each bite. Better consumed with knife and fork, in my opinion.  6-21-16 Okay so most who read my reviews know I am technical to a flaw having trained, servers, bartenders, bussers, cook staff, host staff etc.  today I may have had the best overall experience I've had in a long time. Justin understood the first time he was told we were not in a hurry. At first he informed us on the happy hour specials we were in time for. He took our order for drinks and starters and returned on two separate trips bringing drinks then starters. We then informed him we were ready to refer dinner to which he stopped what he was doing to submit our order. He checked back three times during our meal with the last time reminding us to save room for dessert.  I did have to quiz Justin though and got the reaction I thought I would get. After reading the menu and specifically the description of the Whiskey River Burger where some joker wrote in something about being able to hold the burger for 8 seconds. So my question to Justin was ""what do I get if I hold this burger for 8 seconds"". He was as clueless as anyone could be. He admitted that this menu version has only been in the restaurant for a week and that he hadn't read it yet.  I appreciate his honesty but find it difficult to understand why the management team wouldn't alert the servers of this so they don't look clueless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-westland?start=20

If you are not familiar with Red Robin, they offer a wide variety of burgers, sandwiches, salads ,fish, pasta, soups, appetizers and desserts.  In addition, they have a great bar and plenty of non alcoholic drinks and milk shakes.

But that changed when she couldn't get my burger right. After two attempts, both failed, I just suffered through it. After I ate, I went to use the bathroom and was disgusted. The bathrooms weren't updated in their remodel. One stall had no lock, another was covered in pee and the third had toilet paper every where and the toilet hadn't been flushed.

Michael H.,"Inkster, MI",24,99,,3.0,2/7/2015,"Okay, so I tried their limited time only crab cake burger, and as a result I really highly recommend the chicken bruschetta on ciabatta bread. That sandwich never fails to satisfy due to it having the right balance of flavors, varying textures and moisture level. The crab cake burger on the other hand disappointed. The ciabatta bread was good. The aioli was good. Everything on it was good except for the star ingredient--the crab cake. The crab meat in the crab cake was under seasoned which made the sandwich taste kind of bland. And the crab cake mixture was way too wet for how thick the crab cake was. That made the crab cake have a mushy consistency. And from how the crab cake looked, I would hazard a guess that the crab cake might have been factory made and frozen, not fresh, hand made. Disappointing, because I love a good fresh, hand made crab cake. The next time I go to a Red Robin I will be back to the chicken bruschetta on ciabatta bread.

We both like our fries extra crispy and asked for them that way. They came nice and crisp and extra well done just the way we like them. I asked if there was mayonnaise on my chicken sandwich and the waitress said there was. I like a little but often the cooks slather it on with a trowel. She suggested I get it on the side which is exactly what I did. The sandwich was great. The only things that keep this from being a 5 star rating is that we had to wait probably 5 minutes at the door before we were seated. It was early and not at all crowded so there really wasn't an excuse for that. The other thing is those darn plastic baskets they serve the sandwishes and fries in and the silly paper liner. First, I like to cut my sandwich in half when they're that big. It's hard to do in a curvy 'woven' basket. I also like to use mustard on my fries.
