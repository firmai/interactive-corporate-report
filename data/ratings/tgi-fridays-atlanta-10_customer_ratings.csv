Yes, a very sad tale of said business traveler stuck in Hotlanta airport due to a 3 hour flight delay. In fact, the entire airport was closed, so you can imagine what that did to everyone's moods? All the finer dining choices were jam backed with people queuing up. I decided not for me. I already had enough of people having been squeezed in next to them for the past four hours. I went with the strawberry salad, red Poweraide and a chocolate brownie. The salad was good, a little fresher than I had expected so nothing really to complain on that end. The brownie, well, it was not so great, but of course I ate it. What else was I suppose to do with the next few hours?

Type of cuisine: American Grub. Everything from burgers and chicken wings to pasta, ribs, sandwhiches, salads, desserts and that's just the tip of the iceburg. Ambiance: The loud, neon-lit space, very reminiscent of a 1950s diner welcomes all weary travelers into its crowded ranks. Everything from black and white checkered wall print, to enlarged photographs of the Hollywood sign, and various signs from Las Vegas are colorfully collaged on the walls, from framed black and white photos of the ""Ghostbusters"" trio and Elvis Presley, to a motorized bike, pool balls in a triangle and one drum protruding from the walls. Brighly colored media prints of Marilyn Monroe, white bulbs connected to spell out the word KITCHEN, wood-paneled walls (where one can see them), and stars spangling the hanging ceiling lamps and the glass around our mini booth. What I ordered: Boneless Buffalo Wings ($11.43), topped with Classic Buffalo Sauce, served ith celery, ranch and Bleu cheese dressings, the New Steakhouse Bleu Cheese Burger ($10.89), crumbled bleu cheese, applewood-smoked bacon, caramelized onions and garlic maison butter served over a grilled 100% USDA choice Black Angus beef patty, all contained within a hearty brioche bun, topped with fresh lettuce, pickles, onion and vine-ripened tomatoes, and the California Club ($9.67), which included mesquite-smoked turkey breast, applewood-smoked bacon, ham and Monterey Jack cheese on toasted ciabatta bread with Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and mayo. Each of our meals came with a side of seasoned fries. What I loved: Boneless Buffalo-flavored Chicken Wings. The seasoned fries were a very close second. Why I loved it: While I am most accustomed to finding a quick grab-and-go snack at airports where I have a layover, Chris seems to know all of the best places to find a sit-down restaurant. When we travel together, there is almost no other option. Cost: Average ($9.67 - $10.89 per burger/sandwich)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.6000000000000005,2.96

Go here for the bar, beer and the tv.  My experience with the food and waitstaff was undesirable. Ordered a simple appetizer pick 3. Food came out 10 minutes before beverages. My potstickers looked anemic. Not sure if they fry them in a fryer or pan fry them but they appeared freezer burned and had a very strange white speckled look to the dough, not at all appetizing. Miso sauce on the boneless wings was cloying sweet and goopy. GARNISH  and celery LOOKED LIKE IT WAS OLD, DRY AND UNSANITARY. Everything was sitting on top of garnish and dried celery including the serving dish of sauce so why would anyone risk eating it.  The food temp was like warm...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.3120000000000003,2.72

Nothing complicated mind you, and it wasn't busy at 4:30 in the afternoon. A lady came in and sat behind me. She asked me if I had been waiting long? I told her it had been over 10 minutes.

She was very kind and told the lackadaisical server that I had been sitting there longer waiting.

The one perk, is the few minutes you get to quietly catch up with your emails and chill before you need to get to your departing gate. There are no outlets, so no option of charging your phone while you wait. Food is not important at this location but service is even worst. The servers have no concept of travelers and their limited time to eat. You get seated and you have to wait easily 10 minutes before someone comes over and introduces themselves.  The food is dry and/or greasy. Kids chicken fingers are heavily breaded and dry. Meanwhile, the pretzel appetizer was so greasy that the bread was drenched in a greasy butter sauce that was soaked.  Ended up drinking my beer, at least that was cold and standing up by the exit with my cash to hunt down my server.

The woman behind the bar was absolutely phenomenal!  She was super sweet and welcoming, while also staying on top of all of the bar orders.  They have a good assortment of draft beers, and they are very decently priced.  For dinner, I had the Million Dollar Cobb salad with steak.  It was huge!  It included blue cheese, bacon, boiled egg, tomatoes, cucumber, and fresh avocado.  The steak was a delicious addition. Everyone at the bar was so friendly, and I was able to have nice conversations while watching sports on TGI Friday's large bar TVs.  I never felt rushed, and my layover flew by.  The food was wonderful for an airport stop.  I highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10,2.64,2.81,2.81,,2.742

It does not seem to be as big as the other terminals, and does have limited options for restaurants, so I decided to go here so I could enjoy sitting down and have a drink with my meal. Something that I really appreciated about this location is that when I entered, the hostess asked if I had at least 45 minutes until my flight, because that was the expected amount of time to be served. While that is a long time to wait for food, I was not in a rush, but really appreciated being informed of this prior to being seated. I was given one of the high top tables in the bar area, and was brought a menu immediately after being seated. I ordered a beer and my entree and the beer was brought almost immediately and the meal was brought after about 25 minutes - even better than their estimated time! All of the staff were extremely helpful, and while the food was okay, it was not anything to go out of your way for.

My server, Jasmine, was really good. I ordered a medium rare burger and she warned me that it would be very bloody so I took here advice and got medium instead. It was pink in the middle, just the way I like it. My burger was excellent. Really hit the spot.  I was also given the option of several different sides so I got broccoli.
