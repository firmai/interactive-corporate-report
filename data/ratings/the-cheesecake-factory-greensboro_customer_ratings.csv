66,Wes H.,"Gibsonville, NC",86,19,20.0,5.0,2016-10-18,So far so good!!! 30 min wait to a table on opening day is not bad!!! And the service is great!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=100,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002
135,Ryan O.,"Browns Summit, NC",0,3,,5.0,2016-10-20,"The wait was short considering it was grand opening night. Service was amazing. The Chicken Bellagio may be my new favorite chicken dish. The decor was amazing, they put a lot of thought into the ceiling design. It was really nice to look around at it all while waiting for our food. The cheesecake is also absolutely amazing. The bathroom was also very nice and clean. I would definitely check this place out if you haven't already!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=120,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676
15,Wendy N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",69,231,180.0,4.0,2016-10-20,"I had lunch here yesterday; they just had their Grand Opening the day before, so it's still more of a training session than a smooth operation, but I had a very nice lunch in lovely surroundings. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, so I was surprised at how beautiful the interior was, especially for a place with ""Factory"" in their name. The place was PACKED at 11:55 a.m., and my coworker and I considered ourselves lucky to snag an open bartop table inside (there was one remaining available table on the covered patio offered to us).  The menu is pages and pages and pages long, but rather than overwhelming me, it just made me want to come back a million times to try everything they are offering. I had a wild mushroom soup that was delicious, an egg roll sampler that was pretty good, and the tres leches cheesecake was divine! The food here is 5-star.  The service is what prompted my 4-star review. Everyone working here is friendly and delightful, but like I said, this was day two for them and things just weren't quite ready for prime time. I had to repeatedly request a straw, the servers (working in tandem) didn't know what all came on a sandwich we inquired about (coworker has to avoid avocados currently), my lunch was delivered but then the manager/server blinked at my coworker and asked if she had ordered anything to eat (she had), she was eventually given a sandwich that she hadn't ordered, then she was given the sandwich that she actually did order, little annoyances like that. And it took us TWO HOURS to get out of there... that is unacceptable for a lunch ""hour.""  I think once they work out the kinks and get more smooth/confident with the service, this is going to be a fabulous place to eat. I'm excited about this very welcome addition to the Greensboro restaurant scene!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
94,Maureen S.,"Greensboro, NC",18,35,8.0,2.0,2016-10-23,"This review is 2 stars only because of service issues.  I thought all the food was excellent.  We had the avocado and zucchini fries and grilled artichoke appetizers, both of which were good.  The flavor on the grilled artichoke was out of this world.  For entrees, we had the anti-oxidant salad, the guacamole salad, chicken mushroom marsala, a kids chicken tenders and a kids grilled cheese.  Took home the white chocolate raspberry, banana and original cheesecake.  Everyone loved their food. Now for the service.  I want to preface this by saying that I completely understand this is the first week they opened and that deserves some leniency.  But my issues are listed below:  -Time between being seated and getting a drink order in was to long  -time between getting drinks and getting food was way too long  -had to request things multiple times (beer order 3 times, ketchup twice, etc)  -was asked TWICE if I had paid for my beer that I brought to the table from the bar.  Once is almost understandable for new wait staff.  Twice was rude, offensive and forgetful/negligent.  Learn how your bar works our as the bar and not the customer if the tab has been closed out.  -on a separate occasion (today), I called in at 3:20pm to check on the wait.  I was hung up on twice before finally getting someone to transfer me to the hostess station where a woman in a deadpan voice rudely told me of course there was a wait.  After a few moments of silence I asked what the wait was.  Exasperated, she asked how many in my party and then told me 2.5-3 hours and hung up.   I get that there will be growing pains but if you are going to charge these kinds of prices, the service needs to be better and the hostess needs a serious attitude adjustment, no matter how far in the weeds they are.  The food was good, the cheesecake was excellent, the service was pretty bad.  I will amend my review if we go back after it slows down and the service improves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=80,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

124,Jessica H.,"Greensboro, NC",132,1,,1.0,2016-10-26,"Went in around 4 pm and was immediately seated. The wait however in between the hostess seating our party and even having a server acknowledge us was at least ten minutes. In addition to this, our waitress walked by at least three times and looked at our table before she said she would be right back, she didn't even offer to get our drink orders or offer us water. Then a second waiter come up and said he would be taking care of us. No explanation was given as to what happened to our original server. Instead of apologizing he rudely said that he would just take our order. I'm sorry but both me and the girlfriend I was with wait tables and know that all that was needed to clear up the situation was a ""I'll be right with you"" and a simple apology. Neither was offered and management did nothing to help. Needless to say we walked out and went to another restaurant in the Friendly Center. I understand being busy, but all that was needed was a simple acknowledgement that wasn't given. Also, management please pay more attention to when you see guests leaving before placing an order.

78,David M.,"Greensboro, NC",2,41,,4.0,2016-10-28,"Went there last week.  Typical experience as with all the other factories we've been to in various states....crowded, great food, big portions and extra time at the gym!  Took forever but glad they came to GSO finally.  Building is nicely done inside though they did have limited space, so waiting area and aisles are skimpy on space.  Parking is stretched too.  Until the newness wears off a bit, be prepared for a wait.  And some great food choices, including amazing cheesecake of course!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=100,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
71,Kelley R.,"Greensboro, NC",0,6,,1.0,2016-10-28,"I had an interesting experience when I called this evening to get information about wait times to be seated. After a lot of ringing, someone answered and said they had to transfer me to the hostess desk and after holding for almost 5 minutes a girl finally picked up and she was very unpleasant, seemed almost annoyed that she had to answer the phone. She gave me the wait time and when I started to ask another question she hung up on me, didn't say goodbye or anything. I get that they're busy because they just opened but it is possible to be efficient when working and still be polite. The hostess I spoke with should have at least said ""have a good day"" or something so I'd have know she was trying to abruptly end the conversation. Not the best first impression from Greensboro's Cheesecake Factory.  I hope this one experience with the FOH isn't a reflection of this Cheesecake Factory location as a whole. I might still come at some point to at least get the full experience. But the experience I had talking to the hostess wasn't exactly what you'd call good customer serc. Perhaps this Cheesecake Factory should reconsider the people they have up front. Someone else left a review describing a similar experience when speaking to a hostess.  Update: So, was someone supposed to contact me or something? I completed the online review form as I was told to do in the response from ""Guest Services of The Cheesecake Factory"" because you wanted to ""speak to me directly"". I have received no response from anyone to speak directly to. So........yeah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=100,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

75,Ebony M.,"Browns Summit, NC",136,38,49.0,4.0,2016-11-01,"Let me disclaim by saying I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! OK, now that's out the way, here is my honest review of the new Cheesecake Factory in Greensboro. I have dined three times since opening (one being the training night which was superb). This review is based upon my experience last night with my teenage daughter in tow. We arrived on a very busy night (end of GHOE festivities) so we were not offended by the 60 minute anticipated wait time. We found a seat outside and chatted with another patron who had never dined there. Much to our surprise, we were buzzed back within 30 minutes. Score! We were immediately seated outside and the views underneath the awning are great. Very serene and romantic, if you are looking for that type of atmosphere. Our server did take a while to greet us. Matter of fact, he greeted the table that was seated well after us first. At any rate, he redeemed himself by apologizing for his delay and immediately serving us bread. My daughter opted for the Chicken Bellagio and she LOVED it. She was super happy with her choice. I tasted a bite of it and the noodles were seasoned to perfection. My entree was the Kobe Beef Burger and fry. YUMMY! The Burger was moist, full of flavor and topped with plenty mushrooms. Even the fries were tasty and crisp. The only issue we had was we were repeatedly brought the food of the table to our left. At one point, the food was even placed in front of us. When their cheesecake came and the young lady tried to hand it to me, I just politely shared it was for the table next to me. Other than that, we had a great experience. We left very full and very satisfied. Oh, how could I forget, my daughter begged me to get the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake for us to split. We ordered it to go but it was served on a plate. No biggie...We split it down the middle and enjoyed the rich goodness of this cheesecake.  I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I did enjoy this one. I do prefer all chocolate and will get that kind in the future if I decide to splurge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=100,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
121,Alexandra G.,"High Point, NC",0,14,,4.0,2016-11-02,"I've dined at the Cheesecake Factory in 7 different states and was elated to learn it was finally coming to Greensboro. My husband and I decided to wait a couple of weeks after opening to allow the staff to work out growing pains.  We arrived today, on a very busy night, and had an approximately 40 minutes wait. The whole experience, start to finish, was as delightful as in any CF anywhere else.  The host was smiley, cheerful, and very polite. Our waitress provided for a prompt and courteous service. I would like to commend the whole of the staff for doing a great job making guests happy. Being such a busy restaurant, these young people have to work very hard, and they most certainly do.  We ordered cocktails, the avocado rolls (of course!), the giant Cobb salad, one of the pastas, and several cheesecakes. All food and drink was of superb quality and arrived promptly.  My only gripe would be about CF company policy in general and not Greensboro location in particular - rather than charging too much money for the gigantic portions (most every guest ends up getting a doggy bag), I'd be happy to see portions reduced to healthy, normal size, and prices appropriately lowered. Dear CF managers, have you ever truly looked at the size of your Cobb salad, for example? What human can possibly consume that much food? Your present portion size policy encourages overeating, and being in a country known as the most obese country in the world, this shows lack of care for consumer's health. I understand the corporate desire to sell more and get more income flow, however there are other, more appropriate ways to achieve growth. Attitudes are changing, if you don't keep up with the times, in the near future you'll see your company name blacklisted by the health conscious consumer. Getting a plate of food considerably larger than one's head is borderline offensive. We are not pigs. Take it home for lunch the next day, I hear you say? Well, if soggy salad or cold pasta you'll have to stick into microwave is your deal, you might. Personally, I pay for fresh food, and having to consume half of it the next day really takes away from the value. As for our family, we will continue visiting your wonderful restaurant, but only about once a year, for special occasions, giving the bulk of our weekly business to other establishments that care a bit more about health of their patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=120,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004

28,Jim K.,"Greensboro, NC",101,366,162.0,3.0,2016-11-03,"This place is a huge hit in Greensboro!  While still in their honeymoon period, Cheesecake Factory has everything going for it to be a top draw: great ambiance, extensive menu ( there's something for everyone), great location, and knowledgeable service.  We had an hour wait for our table on a Wednesday night and there was still a waiting line at 9 when we left.  While the crowds will most likely dissipate in coming months, this place will probably always have a line.  I strongly recommend making a reservation, especially if you have a party of more than four. For a chain restaurant, the food is really good.  I had a mushroom burger that would stand up to the best burgers in town.  A few in our party had the flatbreads and loved them.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The knock here is the pricing: $14 for a burger and fries? Really?  I'd be a big fan if the pricing was more in line with similar restaurants.   Now that cheesecake - man that's some good stuff!  We had the salted caramel cheesecake which was awesome!  Make sure you save room for dessert.  There's a bakery area where you can buy cheesecakes if that's all you are interested in. Service was good. Our server knew the huge menu and provided good recommendations.  The service from the bar was a tad slower than expected, but is understandable with the huge crowd.  These servers are working hard to see that everyone has a good time. Speaking of having a good time, it's obvious everyone is because it's a lively and loud place.  If you haven't tried Cheesecake Factory you should definitely go.  Be patient with the wait and expect to shell out a few more bucks, but you will enjoy the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=20,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997
50,Chris R.,"Greensboro, NC",1,20,38.0,2.0,2016-11-04,"The short version:  Arrived at 5:25pm and got in line, 5:36pm given pager( told 50min wait), 6:50pm called to be seated outside ,700pm order, 705pm bread, 720pm bread ,food arrived 750pm, asked to remake wife's meal @757pm To-go box of wife's food brought to table @8:17pm . At car at 8:25pm Price $81 (after 20%tip  ) nothing comped AND no follow up from manager.  Basically 3 hours of misery. There are so many other gems in greensboro to go eat. Do not come here unless you are very patient, have eaten a meal in the last few hours, or don't mind overpaying for semi-good food. Longer version: We have been to other cheesecake factories in different states and the experience was drastically better. ~80 minutes actual wait instead of 50 min. ""Patio okay "" means ""patio only "" as other groups of 4 who came way after us had their pager go off first and sat inside. It was busy and we had to make our way through the herd of people asking us when we got there and how long we were waiting. The friendly hostess took my pager and shortly after we were seated outside. The server greeted us and we got our drinks. My raspberry lemonade I planned to share with my daughter was not available when they brought the other drinks. I ordered strawberry instead and it came about 10 minutes after being served a water. Bread was delivered but no plates or silverware with it. A nice bus boy stopped to give us plates and silverware after we asked. Good luck trying to get anyone's attention in white. They all seem to be overwhelmed. Our food was ordered and waiter gave my wife the suggestion to order ""spicy cashew chicken"". After seeing other tables getting food who sat after us, we were offered more bread. Now I understand a table of two can get their food ""faster"" but a kid's grilled cheese doesn't take that much longer added to two regular adult plates.  We got our food almost an hour after ordering, and to top it off, my wife's rice was soaked in sauce to the point I wouldn't even eat it or trade. She also said the fried chicken pieces were soggy because the thick black (soy ?) sauce was extreme. We sent it back and I was hesitant to have them remake it considering we waited an hour for our food. So they ""cancelled"" the original one and entered the meal again on our ticket. I was brought the bill before my wife's food even came out. This time her food took 20 minutes and I assume since I had my meal boxed already and my kid's grilled cheese boxed and our pre-ordered cheesecake boxed, the waiter decided to get them to deliver her food in a box/bag. My wife never ate her meal and we left having had to pay for it even after asking the waiter why there were two orders on the bill and one of them being the remake ( remake +$17/-$17). I guess their policy prohibits them actually comping the meal like normal restaurants when food is made improperly or wait times exceed 1 hour and 20 minutes. My crusted chicken Romano was fairly good but it's not enough for me to want to go back anytime soon. So buyer beware. You have been warned. Keep your expectation low and keep your wallet upside down and open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=40,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

It is a beautiful location but that's about the only thing nice I have to say. It took about an hour for our order to be taken. I ordered my usual Lemon Herb Chicken. Waited forever for it to come out and I was starving. The chicken looked like it was freeze dried. It was dry, black, and the meat was hard. I immediately brought it to my waiter's attention. They offered to make it over or I could order something else. Well, I asked for them to remake the dish. Everyone else is finished eating, still no food for me. Well I finally asked could it be packaged to go. Waited another 15-20 mins before it was brought out. The waitress that was helping with the table finally starts bringing out receipts. Imagine my surprise that I have to pay full price. While it's not about the $19.75, I felt I should have at least been offered a discount.  I wasn't even offered any fries or anything to eat on while my new order was being remade. I asked to speak to the manager on duty. After waiting over 10 mins, I get up and go to the hostess. I ask for the manager again. She finally comes up to me and I explain the situation. How she never offered to make it right, never came to the table to see what the issue was. She had a really bad attitude. I told her that her customer service was horrible and they can keep the food because I refuse to pay for it. I left the food and I left. I'm hungry but I would rather go to a fast food place.

I always have to park all the way over in the Belk parking lot, I wonder how much of that was considered when they were building it at its current location. The food is good.... as usual. The most consistent part of a Cheesecake Factory is your favorite dish is always going to taste the same no matter the location (the Miso Salmon is the BEST)! The service is pretty good too. I sat at the bar this last time and the servers were nice and pretty on point. The restaurant is way to small to meet the demands of the G'boro market. I've heard of 2 hour waits at this place.

13,Erik S.,"Greensboro, NC",87,211,198.0,4.0,2016-11-15,"Cheesecake Factory is a favorite of my wife and I, as it was one of the first places we ate at when we first started dating, albeit at the Durham location. We were very excited to learn that a location was being built in Greensboro, but as with many others, were a little perplexed to hear about where exactly they were going to cram this thing in at Friendly Shopping Center. Full disclosure: We knew that the wait times were going to be ridiculous. They have never not been ridiculous at any location we have ever been to. I would assume they are even worse than usual at this location, since it is definitely one of the smaller ones I have seen, and i'd guess would be even worse on a hot or cold day, as the patio seating would lose some of the appeal. With that in mind, we came here at 8:30pm on a Thursday night. To our elation, the wait was a short 10 minutes. Based on the feedback of others, we will continue to only come here during ""Off"" times. Nothing has changed on the food front. The food is very good, which is why people wait for it. This is consistent across the locations. The menu is huge, and that would normally be a turn-off, but for the fact that they actually do most all of it pretty well. I could list everything I've ever had at these places, but really it isn't necessary, just know that you're going to get good food once you get seated. You could tell this location is not a well oiled machine yet. Lots of confusion up front, lots of disarray in what I'm guessing is the kitchen. Our server did the best he could, kept us informed, got us the items as they became available, and was super friendly... but here were the mess ups: No bread, we waited quite a while for any bread at all, and it was only 1 of the 3 types. For awhile, they were out of tea, so my wife and I shared hers until more got brewed. Up front, there was just a backlog of people who all got summoned together, so no one really knew who was supposed to follow who. I am sure that everyone else who has reviewed is 100% right, there is absolutely no way that the parking situation here is even slightly passable during the hours where other businesses in the shopping center are running. We avoided this mess by coming so late, but I would think that during the normal lunch hours, you are going to have a very hard time parking. I would suggest parking in the back of the Whole Foods lot across the side street there. I would also suggest dropping off your car-mate and having them get in line while you search. This is just a horribly selected location by the ownership. This restaurant needed to be bigger, and there certainly needed to be a lot more parking consideration made. I hope the other restaurants nearby are getting rent discounts due to this nightmare. FOUR stars is a generous review given by me, based on my experiences at the chain in general, and the hope that this location becomes better with time and experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.288,2.68
46,Christina H.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,,3.0,2016-11-16,"We tried to go here the Saturday before last, around 5:30 p.m., but were told the wait was about three hours, so we decided not to take part in that crazy. So we tried again the following Monday evening around 6:00 p.m., and waited more like 45 minutes for a table. Our server was very friendly, but not the most efficient. It took an overly long time to get our drinks and, at the end, our check -- the two duties of which she was most in charge, as other runners brought our food. Our meals were really very tasty, and portions are monstrous, so be prepared to be stuffed or to take leftovers home. I would actually rate the food above the cheesecake. I had the Cobb salad, which was really yummy, and my husband had a chicken dish that came with the most delicious mashed potatoes. Our daughters chose gluten-free alfredo pasta and chicken sliders, which they thought were okay. My main complaint would be the decided location of this popular chain restaurant. Parking is now going to be even more of atrocious in that section of Friendly Center, and I feel pretty bad for the other businesses around there. The restaurant is smaller than other Cheesecake Factories I've been to, so I would expect wait times to always be pretty long as well, at least during more peak times. It seems like a decent addition to Greensboro, but does not seem very well planned and thought out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=40,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.1879999999999997,2.72

The person on the phone said we needed to come in four hours prior to the time we wanted to be seated.  An actual person needed to come in and speak with the manager.  We expected to eat around 7, so we came in around 3:30 to let them know.  We gave them a phone number and they told us they only block off seating for three hour chunks.  They said they would call us between 5 and 6 to let us know when we would be seated.  No problem. They actually called at 4:20 and expected us to be seated by 4:45 since the party that was at our reserved table is leaving sooner than expected.  Four of us were able to be available by 4:45, so we went there.  Then, they wouldn't seat us because the entire party wasn't there at 4:45 (well, of course not, that's why we said around 7).  I offered to take the table for the four of us if they put the other 8 folks on the list for a table around 7.  They said no.  So we went elsewhere. The total we spent at the alternate venue was $458 and this was only 9 of the 12 people that were originally planning on going to the Cheesecake Factory.  So, they basically missed out on ~$600 of sales because of their terrible seating policies, as well as any future business from us, because I don't want to deal with this again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.056,2.76

130,Martin F.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,,1.0,2016-11-29,"We were thrilled when a new Cheesecake Factory opened right around the corner from us. We eat out 3-4 times a week, usually after 9 PM, so it was great to have a new restaurant with a large diversified menu expand our dining choices. Boy were we wrong. The wine was fine as were our salads, one of which was my wife's entree. For my main course I ordered the jambalaya over linguine. It looked great when it arrived, but in the interest of eating I had to put a fork in it. The entire mass of linguine lifted off the plate. It was so overcooked that the pasta had solidified into one large gloppy mass. The restaurant had provided a soup spoon for twirling the linguine; they should have given me a steak knife to cut the goo into bite-sized chunks. So I sent it back to the kitchen. Iteration 2.0 was marginally better. The linguine was still overcooked but edible and twirlable (I should mention it was 10:30 by now, and I was hungry enough to eat almost anything.). But then I noticed something else. The jambalaya, which the menu described as a Cajun dish contains shrimp and chicken, had no shrimp at all. I guess they ran out and, rather than taking it off the menu, the management figured their customers were too stupid to notice and served it anyhow. After a perfunctory  and unsatisfactory meeting with the manager, the cost of the ""jambalaya"" was deducted from the bill. But this was easily the worst restaurant experience I have had in twenty years, and The Cheesecake Factory missed an opportunity to create a relationship with a once-a-week,regular, high-end, wine-drinking customer. Yecch. And from the point of value, the price was way too high for ""industrial"" food. For a late night meal, Lucky 32, Print Works, Positano's, Green Valley Grill, Village Tavern, and even McDonald's offer better food and better value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=120,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.052,2.76
83,Charlie W.,"Madison, NC",0,1,,1.0,2016-11-30,"Absolutely terrible service, especially given the price of the menu items. Will definitely not be recommending this chain to others in the future. We decided to go during off-hours, when it might not be so busy. For reference, we arrived at 2:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon---it was by no means busy when we got there, maybe a half dozen tables had patrons. We were seated fairly quickly, but then waited half an hour for someone to even ask us if we'd been helped yet. 45min of sitting before we finally got drinks and were able to order an appetizer. By the time the waiter came back around to see if we were ready to order, it had been almost an hour and a half since we'd been sat. The folks in booths behind us had been sat after us and managed not only to be served, but ate, paid, and left before us. We got our food two hours after we'd sat down, and they got my fiance's order wrong. But, we were unable to catch any waiter's attention to correct it, and opted for taking our meal to-go in hopes that we'd be able to leave sooner and just take what we were paying for. It took us a total of two and a half hours to eat a small lunch during off hours. While I know they've just opened and are still fairly new, that's no excuse for the terrible service. If you don't want to spend nearly three hours eating a small, unnecessarily expensive meal, then save yourself the trouble and go to Cheesecakes by Alex instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=80,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.052,2.6

Nope - they wouldn't let us call it in until the day of and also not until they opened - this was also 30 minutes before the time I needed to pick it up. I do about 3 of these lunches per week. Will be using outback in the future because of their much more accommodating policy.

This location is usually packed but we hit it just before the first dinner rush so service was prompt and friendly. Upon being seated we received two sprawling menus ""skinnylicious"" and standard. While both offer a huge number of choices, upon further inspection most of the items were variations on a theme(chicken and mashed potatoes or pasta) with only small details to separate the various entrees.  The food itself was nothing to write home about, both dishes we order received a 'meh' response. The chicken & biscuit dish was a poorly conceived imitation of the traditional southern dish with pan gravy with peas and carrots instead of red eye gravy and grilled chicken instead of fried. The actual biscuits were fine but mashed potatoes were an odd savory choice to go with the dish.  Evelyns pasta dish was a slightly healthier option but were slightly dry and rather cold as if the pasta had been sitting for a while. The dish was also overwhelmingly garlicky.

It was mentioned to our waiter that it was my birthday and he did wish me a happy one and that is all I got for my birthday at the Cheesecake Factory.  Before we got our food, there was the ever popular shift change.  We were introduced to our new waiter but I do not recall his name at this time.  Our food arrived about 45 minutes after we were seated.  The food was good and our new waiter was attentive.   I normally do not allow anyone to let restaurants know when it is my birthday.  But I did this time and it was the first time.  After all, turning 60 is a big deal.  As stated before, our first waiter wished me a Happy Birthday.  I felt there should have been more but that is all I received.  I could have made a fuss but felt it beneath me so I kept quiet.  I watched the young woman at the table beside us receive a dessert and a chorus of Happy Birthday from the wait staff.  May this is reserved for younger patrons.   Any who, I do plan to come back because I do like the food and have had very good service before this.  I hope you can find a way to reduce the time one must wait to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.38,2.64

The restaurant was perhaps 1/3 full. We were seated at a two top that was very close to another table and began our wait.  Our server rushed by with a quick ""I'll be right with you"" and then we waited another 7 or 8 minutes before he returned.   Our order was simple, two cold appetizers off the ""skinnylicious"" menu and an order of sliders.  35 minutes later we got up to leave..no food, no server.  We spoke with the manager about the long, long wait and about that time the food came out - which we did not want.  The presentation on the sliders was awful, they were small, squished and the grilled onions we asked for were nowhere to be seen.  The cold appetizers (summer rolls and a salad) looked okay, but not worth a 40 minute wait. The manager said she wouldn't charge us - seriously? With a 40 minute wait and telling her we did not want the food after that amount of time she better NOT charge us.  She did offer to box our food to go. Out of curiosity,we took only the summer rolls.   A good manager would have offered an incentive to come back, but that didn't happen. At this point, we won't go there again.

I was hoping time would improve the overall quality & experience. Sadly, I left a little disappointed. Let's start with parking; there is never going to be a parking spot in front of the restaurant. Just go straight to the right and park in the larger lot and save yourself some time.  The wait is absolutely ridiculous! It doesn't matter what time or day you go (talking from experience, this was our third attempt) they will always quote you anywhere from an hour to a three hour wait. I swear they are banking on the fact that you hang out in their bar area and keep ordering drinks. Now let's talk about the drink list. You can pretty much find whatever you're looking for ... cocktails, wine, beer (even good craft beer options) & an endless supply of whiskey choices. However, this is the only section on the menu that doesn't give the price. It leads me to believe that this is where they are making most of their profit. A craft beer from Asheville cost $7 and a whiskey cocktail cost $12 (I think this is a little steep).  The menu itself is expansive; even the pickest eater can find something they like. I think this is where the confusion occurs with the servers, there is just too much to memorize. Even our server was honest and said that she didn't know when I asked her a question about one of the cocktails.  Everything is good, I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory chain for years and have never been disappointed with the food  and that still remains true. P.S. - you have to get cheesecake, that was the whole foundation for the restaurant in the first place... at the very least you can get it to go :-D My reservations on returning are as follows: parking is a nightmare. Everybody is racing to either get your spot or steal the spot you want. The wait is just simply ridiculous. Greensboro has other great restaurants, even in the same plaza that are comparable in food (if not better) and will seat you right away. The drinks are way over priced. When I go out I usually like one drink before dinner and one during... I just can't convince myself that it's okay to pay $24 for two drinks that I can make at home.  With that being said maybe I'll try the to-go option next time if I find myself really craving the chicken Madeira & cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.348,2.76

74,Mary M.,"High Point, NC",56,7,,1.0,2017-04-07,"I'm just glad Harper's was next door to pick up what CF dropped. After learning a week ago that CF refused reservations or even, advanced seating on a Friday night, my 16-yr-old was still insistent that she have her birthday dinner for 9 at CF. I was ok with her learning this lesson the hard way. When we arrived at 6:30, the hostess advised us that the manager would need to quote a group so large (seriously? 9 is large?). Anyway, the manager quoted us 3-4 hours and refused me a pager until I checked back in at 7:30, to be sure we still wanted to stay. The kids arrived and were distraught at having to wait so long, but couldn't decide on another restaurant, so husband took the wheel and called next door to Harper's, who could accommodate us easily. At 7:15, I told the hostess that we would be leaving to go to an establishment that could accommodate us. She said, ""Are you sure? We just got a cancellation and were cleaning off a table for you!"" Strange...but we decided to stay and canceled next door. We waited patiently for another 1/2 hour, during which time, that same hostess asked if we were another party and I replied, ""No."" She looked up from time to time, but would look down quickly when I caught her eye. Finally, at 7:45, I approached her again and asked if the promised table was almost ready. She asked my name and looked at the computer and proceeded to tell me that we had come in at 6:30, they'd quoted us 3-4 hours, hadn't given us a pager and it was now an hour later, so we still had 2-3 hours to wait! I reminded HER of the whole cancellation thing and she said there'd been a ""miscommunication"" and that that message was actually for another party of 9 and that we still had to wait. She said she didn't recognize faces and hadn't realized that she'd told the wrong people. All 9 of us were very disappointed with the roller coaster ride of trying to get dinner and we have all sworn off ever trying to eat there again. I can't imagine there'll be much problem getting a table a year from now with the way this location is being ""managed.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=100,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.116,2.72

My fault as I didn't check the price before ordering. Also the iced tea was $3.00 per glass. Too expensive for my taste considering it was just ok.

It left a bad impression with my family.  My daughter and I have ate Cheesecake factory before in Charlotte. Great experience! My daughter was looking forward to eating her birthday at Cheesecake factory in Greensboro since it was much closer. It was a 2 hour wait for a party of 9. We were all starved by the time we were seated. Waitress who waited us was friendly. But only brought us one small thing of bread for 9 of us. We order appetizer. Which we only got half of the appetizers. Our glasses were empty for a good while before she came back to refill them. Never offer to bring more bread.  We didn't see our waitress for awhile. Waitress finally came to our table in inform us one of the steaks was taking awhile and that was the hold up. Really does it take a hour to cook steaks! By the time we all gotten our food everything was COLD! Even the Steak was almost rare which it was suppose to be medium to well done. Only one person out of 9 liked their food! Food tasted horrible! Someone of us sent our food back. That's when the manager came over and apologized. Second time around our order was wrong even parts of the steak wasn't done!  I ordered a cheese burger there was no cheese! Manager took it back came back with cheese on it. I could tell the hamburger was put in the microwave to melt the cheese! They never came around to sing Happy Birthday to my daughter as requested! Even though everyone else around us they were singing happy birthday! We all did ordered Cheesecakes to go.

Seating has always been within 20 minutes, which is an acceptable amount of time to wait for me. Parking, however, is pretty terrible. There's parking at the shops nearby that you'll probably have to utilize. The interior ambiance is nice, with an upscale, glitzy feel and well-themed decorations. The food is definitely good and tasty, but not anything exceptionally special. In my opinion, it's also overpriced. In terms of a minor issue, for me, the huge range of menu selections actually works against the experience, complicating it rather than enhancing it. I'd like to try all of the flavors that Cheesecake Factory has to offer, but I'd prefer that they condense those flavors into a select few representative dishes so that I don't have to flip through all 20+ pages of the menu trying to decide what I want.

96,Rob G.,"Greensboro, NC",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-08,"Let me start with the only good thing, and that is the ambiance.  The restaurant is very nice as far as looks and layout.  Now onto the bad.  There were 3 of us that went there for a dinner on a Sunday evening.  They brought us bread, with no plates.  I caught a waitress and asked for some bread plates.  She came back a minute later and said they were out of bread plates but would get some to us when they had some.  First....that wouldn't work as by that time we would be done with the bread.  Second....how do you run out of bread plates?  And how are we supposed to butter them without laying them on the table....so we used our napkins as plates.  And the bread plates never came. We had 3 simple orders.  2 were a hamburger and fries, one was a steak and fries.  They brought out the hamburgers and steaks with no fries.  I asked where the fries were, and they explained they weren't ready yet but they didn't want our burgers and steak to get cold, so brought them out first.  Really?????  I expect that at a McDonalds, but if I am paying $14 for a cheeseburger and fries, I think they can do a little better than that.  The fries came out about mid way through our eating our burgers/steak.   I had 2 beers....Red Oak.  Pretty popular around here, and I expect to pay $4, maybe $5 for that beer.  I got the bill and it was $7/beer.  My fault, I should have asked, but wow, that's ballpark prices.   Food is good, so I guess that is the second good thing, but I'll never go back.  I can get good food a lot of places, good service is getting more rare, and these guys aren't even close.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=80,2.52,2.5,2.5,,2.508
3,Megan V.,"Greensboro, NC",192,85,217.0,2.0,2017-08-11,"The inside of The Cheesecake Factory is grand, loud, and touristy like a restaurant at Universal or Disney World. The menu was incredibly extensive, and everyone had a hard time parsing through it to pick their food.  Maybe it's just us, but no one in our party of 5 liked their meal. Is that a coincidence?  I ordered a crispy shrimp pasta with diced tomatoes, various leafy greens, all in a lemon cream sauce. I thought it was safe enough. Someone was very heavy handed on the parsley, lending the dish a lot of grittiness. Shrimp had 0% crispness, got soggy in the pasta sauce. No go :(  We got the strawberry cake to try and save the meal - beware, it is most definitely not cake! It's more like 2 ice cream sandwiches with thick sugar cookies, and 4 inches of whipped cream on top. Maybe 2 cut up strawberries at the bottom.  All in all, we were grandly disappointed. Maybe we should get a cheesecake. _______________________________  EDIT 8/19/17 Not sure what's worse - guest services having to apologize on a review, or guest services obviously skimming and apologizing for something I didn't order...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro,2.56,2.5,2.5,,2.524

The service was awful & the food very bland & cold! It was a Saturday evening & as expected, busy, but come on-this is THE Cheesecake Factory, they're used to this, so I thought. My meal was missing one of the sides, the rice was dry and cold, and the beans were bland and cold.  I was never given a refill of my beverage & although we asked for bread & were told it was being made & would be brought out shortly-never received it. It also took forever to get our to go dessert-because, ""the bakery was backed up"".  I may call in an order of Cheesecake to go at this location, but I doubt that I'll be returning to dine in.

112,Kenny P.,"Eden, NC",3,22,,2.0,2017-09-10,"I went here for the first time yesterday for my early birthday dinner! The outside, and inside of the place looks fabulous, the wait time is very acceptable for the crowds that line up outside.  I was told 20 minute wait time, however it was more like 35-40 mins, still no problem.  The parking lot is too small for this place, you will probably have to park at one of the shops.  The employees were somewhat friendly.  The friendliest employee was the cook who brought the food out! Haha.  The waitress was pretty good also, but....she offered to refill the drinks only 1 time! I have to mention the cleanliness of the place inside.  I noticed that there was a napkin on the floor against the wall, food laying on the floor, and tables were not being wiped off, before other customers sat down, employees were just laying plates on the table, and leaving.  Now for the food, my bro. ordered the macaroni & cheese burger with fries, I ordered the fish & chips with fries, & coleslaw.  For the apps my bro. ordered the buffalo blasters, and I ordered the loaded baked potato tots.  The burger was pretty much burnt, my fish had no taste whatsoever, the tartar sauce they make is nasty! My tots were very good though.  The prices do match the quality, or quantity at all.  Also just to let you know this place is not a quiet place by far.  I have figured out if you eat here do not order something that you can get pretty much anywhere, everyday.  For example order something like a pasta plate, or steak.etc otherwise you probably will leave unhappy like myself.  That's it folks!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro?start=60,2.52,2.5,2.5,,2.508

But we did enjoy the cheesecake!  And others in the groups had other desserts that were very quickly consumed.  It is a shame they can't get their service and meal act together so you could get a great meal and excellent dessert at the same place.  But it does give us a place to go to after a great home cooked meal to be able to top it off with a relaxing and enjoyable dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greensboro,2.44,2.49,2.49,,2.47

0,Christina L.,"Summerfield, NC",128,137,97.0,3.0,2017-11-19,"Best Chicken Piccata I've ever had! But go when they're not on a wait. We went on Saturday night when one of the local universities had a earlier football game, so they were predictably slammed. No problem with them being busy, but the host staff did struggle to give accurate quote times. We we're quoted 40 minutes, but waited over an hour to be seated. They would only put parties of 2 at 2-tops, which is of course maxing their seating capacity by not seating us at a 4-top that came open well before our 2-top, but when you're over quote there should be an exception to that practice. Also, we never got an apology or even an acknowledgement that we had waited well in excess of the quoted time. We also had to ask for menus while we waited... should be standard practice. We were encouraged to wait on a heated patio, and we're curious as to why they don't turn that into a dining area. Maybe the kitchen wouldn't be able to keep up with that many more tables. We had to go to the crowded bar to get drinks. 10 minute wait for those as well. Once seated, our Server came and introduced herself and inquired about a drink order. We had already made our decisions about drinks, appetizers, entrees, and of course cheesecake, due to the long wait for the table. But there wasn't any attempt to consolidate her steps of service, so we laid it out for her before she could run off. She was friendly and efficient otherwise. Edamame was a nice starter, served with kosher salt and maybe a hint of garlic. My Chicken Piccata was absolutely sublime. Creamy and delicious, and a generous portion. My dining companion's steak Madeira was unfortunately well done despite being ordered medium-rare. The second one was perfect, but by then I was nearly done with my entree, making it awkward. She was offered a salad while she waited, but I was not offered anything in recognition of the uneven finish times. Small thing, really, but a good best practice to adopt in an upscale restaurant in my opinion. And still no manager visited us. I'd definitely go again, but not on a busy night.

The menus were insanely grimy and the food was ridiculously slow to arrive. We spent a total of two hours in there from sit down to departure because the wait for everything was long. Our server was attentive, but a little dry and it was a bit off putting when they reached out from the podium to hand my wife an extra wrap of flatware and napkin. The food was ok, I had Shrimp Carbonara. They were very heavy-handed with the peas and bacon, though. The portion size was really small for the $20 price and I had actually wondered if I was mistakenly served a lunch portion.

The waitress from the back walks up with our bread and places it down to go look for the bartender. After 15 mins of standing we decided to walk out. For this name to be under the Chessecake Factory establishment, it is HORRIBLE. Clearly a management issue, oh and the cute girls standing at the podium to greet you are pointless.
