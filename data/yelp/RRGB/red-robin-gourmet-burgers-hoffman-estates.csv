Carrie M.,"Bartlett, IL",1,26,,3.0,10/2/2017,We had 7 people on a Saturday night and it took them at least 15 minutes to bus and wipe down the table for us. I was tempted to go do it myself. It's hard just watching the table sit there with dishes on it for a solid 15 minutes before someone came over and cleaned it. It looked like there was one girl bussing the tables on a Saturday night and she was really slow despite there being a wait.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates
John L.,"Glendale Heights, IL",9,58,2,2.0,7/26/2017,"Are the kiosks on your table watching you? In a word, disappointed. I don't know why they asked if I wanted a little pink in my burger and I said yes it still came in well done. Portions were small, especially the side soups. On the menu it mentions the nachos are now served with extra quac. It was served with ~1/4 cup quac. How disappointed that was. Does that mean at some time prior it was even less? The burgers were good. But everything else you can feel they try to cut all corners. Mostly I was bothered by the  kiosks on our table. I believe they have cameras in each one. I felt uncomfortable feeling these things are recording while we talked and ate. I suppose I could of just turned it around but the ones on the tables across from us were aimed right at us. After dinner, I checked out the kiosk and later found out I was charged $2 for an entertainment fee?  Thank you for the birthday sundae though. That was nice. Overall? I won't BB Maybe I'll try Woodfield location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates

Still at that timr, we have not talked to our waitress.  Finally  she came by and offered another drink. Then we asked for the bill.

Mike A.,"Chicago, IL",41,697,246,2.0,1/26/2017,"I have been to several and absolutely love their burgers.  I am not going to complain about the burgers getting smaller; as I think it still works out to be a good deal. This review is focus on the location, more than RR food itself; as its pretty much on par across the chain and is 4 star! Our waitress had way to many tables and the level of service we received was poor.  Twice we had to grab the manager as he wondered through the place to get refills on drinks. I reluctantly ordered a refill on my fries, but that took so long; that the waitress I guess noticed that none on the table and put in another order.  So at a point when we were about to pay the bill through the kiosk, the first refill finally showed up and a min later the second. Maybe it was an off night, but seemed that either the location is understaffed or poorly managed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates

We walked in and we were greeted right away. I got the turkey burger on the wheat bun which was delicious!!! Only thing I wasn't happy about was paying $1 for cheese when that and mayo was all I got on it. Our sever was excellent till it came time to pay for the bill and we just left cash and left.

Dan S.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,,3.0,6/10/2017,"Chicken tenders were very good as were their fries and sweet potato fries.  The burger appeared to be pre made and tasted pretty bland.  As far as service, try not to get seated where the bartender is your waiter/waitress.  They may be good at what they do but when it gets busy, they get overloaded. Also, if your thinking about their loyalty/royalty program, think real hard before you give them all of your personal info. I don't think it is worth it.  The site will not let you sign up unless you do.  Claim Jumpers has a much better rewards program IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates

Laura N.,"Georgetown, KY",1193,1006,4237,3.0,11/19/2015,"Been to this and other locations a few times in the past but I figured I'd write a review after my experience here with my in-laws last weekend.  The good: - Bottomless steak fries! - Onion tower appetizer! YUM. - So many burgers to choose from. - Extensive selection of drinks for a burger place. The not-so-good: - Crazy loud. Just.. too loud in here.  - Long wait. Why are there even this many people eating here on a Saturday night? Red Robin isn't anything special.  - Tables too close together. When we were finished eating, we had to fold our tables up to have enough room to stand up and leave without bumping into the group dining next to us. Soooo awkward.  - Electronic ordering/paying devices. Some might find this useful but I found it kind of impersonal... Our waitress didn't make many appearances. It's also dangerous! We had an eight-year-old at our table that accidentally ordered and paid for a game. We never played it but it was put on the bill. Not cool.  - The bill for a table of eight was $150+ for each to get a burger, a drink (or two), and all to share an appetizer. NOT worth it, in my opinion.  - I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese burger. It sounded amazing but my expectations exceeded the burger. It was good, but not amazing.  2.5 stars. Rounding up to 3. Meh. It was OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates
Christina M.,"DeKalb, IL",32,4,,2.0,7/26/2017,"Friendly, attentive servers and hostess. Clean and happy atmosphere. The food was tasteful. However, their portions were ridiculous. They served my bowl of soup in what appeared to me as a dipping dish, and when they delivered our appetizer for three people the amount of salsa and guacamole was only a couple tablespoons ?! You can tell they were trying to be stingy with servings. What a rip off! They gave my dad an ice cream sundae on the house which is nice.

Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",438,3672,27606,3.0,8/9/2015,"About a 2-2.5: While in the area, a group of us came to Red Robin for a semi-quick lunch.  The menu, just like other RR locations, offers a variety of burgers, wraps, sandwiches, and even soup and salads.  I had the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger with a side of their steak fries; the burger itself was just okay, but of wrong temperature; the sesame-topped bun was more on the dry/stale end T___T  The fries seem to be on the smaller scale, and not as thick and large as I remember them being.  Our server, who seemed nice, was totally MIA, and so we had to wave down another employee that was passing us by for extra napkins and condiments.  The food seemed to take much longer than the usual, and we were never checked upon to see if we needed anything else.  Even trying to get the check was such a hassle!

There was a 5 us, my wife, mother/sister in law, and my wife's friend. She got to the table and greeted the 5 of us. She took our drink order, except mine. Came back with their drinks and then asked what I wanted. She left us and then came back for our food order. Again didn't take my order, she then took it when she came back for refills.

Lukas S.,"Bartlett, IL",12,207,7,4.0,4/30/2016,"Came for lunch recently and really liked the set-up and atmosphere of this particular location. Our waitress was...nice...but I don't think she smiled at all...maybe once? It was not that busy, yet our service was really slow and lacking. Our food was great! We each got different chicken sandwiches and pretzel bites as an appetizer. The sides really aren't ""bottomless"" when you're server never comes around to ask you if you'd like more of your side. We also sat for quite some time without any refills on our drinks. Luckily neither one of us ordered anything spicy. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the atmosphere and food and the fact that everyone else we encountered during our visit was friendly. I'm trying to give our server the benefit of the doubt since everyone has bad days.

Again, my drink sat empty while the bartender would rather eat excess milkshake with a spoon from a customer order.....right in the open.

I ended up having the Whiskey River BBQ burger with sweet potato fries, and my boyfriend had the Big Ghost Tavern Burger with regular fries. I also had the freckled lemonade (which is ALWAYS delicious) and my boyfriend had their iced tea (which, for only 10 calories, was amazing. He let me try it.)

Sarah H.,"Pingree Grove, IL",66,365,27,4.0,7/21/2013,"Decided on dinner here one evening ... we've been to a couple Red Robin locations in the past, and we happened to be in the area & I had a craving for their pretzel appetizer. We ordered the pretzels and the wing/chips combo for our apps. I noticed right away that the beer cheese with the pretzels was a little on the ""old"" side. It was starting to dry out & just didn't seem right. But, since the pretzels were mainly for my daughter & I anyway (while my husband & son dined on the wings) - I didn't care much because I only use a tiny bit of cheese on 1 or 2 pretzels and then I eat the rest of the pretzels plain. A few minutes later a manager came by, and apologized for the cheese. Said they were in the process of making new cheese and that what came out was not up to their standards, and they were sorry and would bring out fresh soon. It wasn't a big deal and we finished the pretzels, so there wasn't a need for more cheese -- and the manager came back over later and told us he ""took care of the pretzels for us"" and apologized again. I thought that was awesome --- we didn't even complain in the first place -- it just wasn't a big deal --- but they recognized something wasn't up to par, and they went above & beyond rectifying it. The rest of our food was tasty -- and the new garlic fries are pretty good too (though, there is a 99-cent upcharge, which they don't exactly mention when they ask you what kind of fries you want to accompany your sandwich).

I ordered the mudd pie for dessert - man this was a monster 5 in ice cream layer, which has major chocolate ice-cream, then vanilla with cookie layer, then hard chocolate and then cookie base at bottom, and topped with whipped cream. This is definitely good enough for 3 people to share easily. Definitely try this if you are a sweet tooth and have one more person for company to finish it. Really good service overall.

Their kids meals we're pretty standard and my son liked his spaghetti, while my daughter liked her upgraded slushy. Red Robin's pretty much a burger/sandwich restaurant.  I had a turkey burger with chipotle sauce.  It was pretty good,.but what I really liked we're the bottom less garlic fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates?start=40
Eric M.,"Elgin, IL",0,4,,2.0,12/5/2014,"I had not been to a Red Robin in a few years and was pretty excited to go again. Food was good, Cold beers, tasty burgers and awesome onion rings. So why a 2, why else the service. Ive had worse service for sure, there was nothing disasterous that happened it was just the attitude of our server and the lack of care that put a damper on the visit. Our waitress didnt really check on us at all during the meal but she seemed busy so not really a big deal. After we finished we waited a while for a bill and ended up asking her for it as she was at bar about 6 feet from us. She seemed irritated and when we declined desert she gave a bit of an attitude. She dropped off the bill and we gave our card, when the bill came back we noticed that we had been given and charged for someone elses bill. We called her back to notify her and she snatched the bill and said ill get a manager with a lot of negativity and attitude, no apology. Manager came back and rushed through an explanation that they just corrected the charge and didnt double charge us then ran off. It wasnt really a big deal but would have been nice to get an apology or seen some sense of them caring. Overall this won't stop me from going to Red Robin but will give it a second thought before choosing this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates?start=40

Lena S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,12,3,1.0,1/16/2015,"Very disappointed.  Came here on a Thursday night and most of the staff that I've encounter seemed like they hated their job. Especially, Casey.  I can see you rolling your eyes, we're not blind! I'm sure I'm not the only that felt that way.  And on top of that my waitress Britney took 30 mins just to take our order, and it very much seemed like she was avoiding our table.  There was a few times when we tried to flag her down but he just walked the other direction. How frustrating, considering the fact that these people work in a industry where providing great customer service is in high demand. I could understand that things could get crazy but you could at least COMMUNICATE with us.  The only time when we got her undivided attention was when she gave us back our receipt, and that was the first time when she smiled at us and said more than a sentence.  Overall,  the only hard worker i saw here was the blonde  pregnant women.

Idk if it's the servers or the cooks who keep messing up but the servers definitely don't make us feel like valued customers.

Maria R.,"Streamwood, IL",173,77,441,5.0,10/6/2008,"Newly opened in the Poplar Creek Center on the corner of Rt. 59 and Higgins. This new Red Robin location is definitely a great addition to the restaurant choices in this area. When I saw they were putting a Red Robin nearer to me(the closest one being the one at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg), I was excited because this place rocks when it comes to burgers. They have a vast menu that goes from their usual gourmet burgers to pasta, soups, salads, and wraps.  Definitely try their Towering Onion Rings which seems to be a very popular appetizer.  I usually order the Royal Red Robin Burger which has a fried egg in it. Rather unique as far as your typical burger place. Their burgers are a good size, not too large, but I'll tell you this much, they are quite packed full of flavorful condiments as well as a tasty burger patty too! (Can be messy if they didn't have the burger wrapping covering half the burger when served.) They have bottomless steak fries which are pretty darn fresh, crispy and hot when the come to your table.  Since they are bottomless, they are always fresh and hot.  But, my husband and I usually don't get much past the initial fry portion though. Have not tried any desserts  yet, but the restaurant itself is typical of the other Red Robins in the area.  Brightly lit, very 60s burger place drive-in feel.  Definitely kid friendly as they have balloons they give to the kids as they leave.  Staff is happy and helpful. And even on a busy busy Friday night, we got seated relatively quickly. (family of four here!)  There is ample parking, but it can get filled up rather quickly as there are several other eateries in the area (Buffalo Wild Wings, Subway, Asta La Pasta, Panda Express, Claim Jumpers, to name a few). We are definitely returning to this Red Robin in the future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates?start=60

The restaurant is nice inside,  the service is fine, and its generally full of screaming kids. They have a large selection of ""burgers"" with all kinds of spicy, gooey, salty or crunchy toppings. If you dont like the taste of meat in your burger, go here.. Imagine a fast food burger dipped in barbecue sauce, jalapenos and blue cheese for $10. You may get your moneys worth if you can eat 6lbs of fries and the pattys are definitely not the 1/2 lb standard were used to.
