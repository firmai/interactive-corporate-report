9,Greg B.,"Mansfield, TX",0,27,38.0,4.0,2015-12-22,"Great service.  Good food.  I forget about this chain sometimes, but really enjoy it.  One of the stand by restaurants.  The chain itself doesn't seem to have a ""stand out"" identity among all the other chain, but I like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-arlington-6,,,,,
8,Lisa J.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-20,After using the nasty restroom there I should have known the food would suck. Literally had to hold my nose it stunk so bad. Gross and they are handling food. Gross,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-arlington-6,,,,,
2,Karla S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",18,56,40.0,1.0,2017-03-11,"If you're looking for the WORST dinning experience ever, then this place will not disappoint. Keep your expectations low and you will not be disappointed.  I Came in tonight to have dinner with family (4 peeps). Had the worst experience ever. We Ordered our drinks and appetizer. Appetizer came out COLD because they had been sitting in the kitchen FOREVER.... but waited over 45 mins for my beer and drinks and they NEVER arrived. I got so frustrated after I asked my waiter to take my order and that never happened either. After an hour of waiting, I finally asked my waiter to pay my tab and he lost his cool. Took off cursing and hollering. I've never had such an awful experience but this topped it off.  I will never come back to this location and I recommend for anyone to find an alternative. Unfortunately, this establishment deserves zero stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-arlington-6,,,,,
7,Alva L.,"Fort Worth, TX",49,9,3.0,1.0,2017-03-12,The restrooms are filthy dirty. Makes you wonder if their kitchen is clean and bad customer service. They also took forever to bring out the breadsticks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-arlington-6,,,,,
6,Grace A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",70,9,7.0,3.0,2017-04-04,"3.8/5 had a long day at work and needed a drank!  I was after a quick buzz. . . I don't normally drink LIT, but Bartender Logan hooked it up. 3.5 because I wasn't greeted at the door, and waited almost 5 minutes to be greeted. And presentation of food could be better, Doesn't look as appealing as the picture in the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-arlington-6,,,,,

0,Jim A.,"Arlington, TX",2,2,,5.0,2017-10-14,"Great Saturday lunch with my kid!  Greeted at the door beautifully and had a great waiter, Oesha.  The kid had Jack Daniels burger and I had the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich.  Both were really well cooked and tasty.  My kid also had the Poppin Boba drink that was delicious. Awesome experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-arlington-6,,,,,

1,Rcm619 ..,"Arlington, TX",2,19,38.0,4.0,2017-11-06,"The staff was very welcoming. As soon as I walked in the door, I felt comfortable. I came around 1:20 so the lunch rush had already come and gone. I ordered a Mac & Cheese Burger with Onion Rings and a blue raspberry lemonade. The order took about 15 minutes to come out, not a biiiiig deal but, the rush was over so I didn't expect that but, no big deal. Overall, I'm pleased with my visit. I'll be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-arlington-6,,,,,
