Andrew C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",92,19,,3.0,1/14/2018,Exactly what you expect from a TGI.  Food is average service is average. They need to fix the tablet capabilities to handle multiple payers,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
Ian D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,29,,1.0,12/26/2017,"My in-laws like Friday's and the likes, so we agreed to eat here. I usually have no problem at all, as the food is reliable and consistent across the board. At least that is what I thought. This place was the worst from start to finish.  Terrible service. Servers arguing with each other and with other staff. The food took a very long time to arrive, and when it did it lacked flavor and appeared to be thrown together.  It was greasy and not appetizing. Our server never came and checked up on during our meal, nor did I ever see a manager. What should have been a 45 minute experience took us 2 hours.  Ouch. Not a rewarding experience, and we will definitely not be returning to this establishment or other Friday's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
Tommi A.,"Philadelphia, PA",103,110,106,1.0,10/3/2017,"I understand TGI Fridays on a Friday are notorious; however, when you have great management issues can be minimized and/or at least be unbenounced to patrons.  Sitting at the bar this past Friday with my cousin we turned around to a disturbance behind us. One of the people sitting at the high top bar behind us had thrown up right behind us. We couldn't even get up to move it was right there. The one who was assigned to clean it was kind enough to say to us that he would have a manager come talk to us and see if they could do anything about the bill. No manager came by and when the bar tender brought us the check and i mentioned this she was very rude. ""A bar back told you he could do something about your bill??"" She was very demeaning and inconsiderate considering how a man just threw up on our heels. It shouldn't have been a question to take care of us.  DONT COME HERE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
Matthew D.,"Schaumburg, IL",145,182,326,1.0,3/18/2017,"Where to begin. I grabbed a seat at the bar as service is usually on point sitting at the bar.  I ordered my beer and the endless app option for $10 which is a pretty stellar option. The food was decent , it's on par for Friday's. The service is probably the worst I've seen except one girl behind the bar. The rest that were here need some training.  I am still sitting at the bar with dirty plates in front of me and I finished my food a half hour ago. Keep in mind I have had a soup, then wings, then pot skins then mozzarella sticks... I finished each app before ordering another and ALL MY DIRTY STUFF IS IN FRONT OF ME, including my first empty beer glass.  I watched a manager walk out to the bar to fix a problem and it's like he's oblivious to the girl on her cellphone behind the bar. How about have her get off her phone and bust the bar?  I watched them do a crappy job at washing glasses which makes me not want to finish my beer right now. I'm in food service, wash rinse then sanitize. Not half wash, rinse and stack. Glasses need to sit for a minimum of 30 seconds in sanitizer this girl didn't even dip them in the solution.  Yes the bar is busy but you have adequate staff... I don't recommend this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
Susie Q.,"Boynton Beach, FL",12,9,,1.0,12/11/2017,"They have seen me for the last time. Super slow service. Re-fried French fries. A wing order, with side salad. 11.50 for 8 wing halves!And I was in there almost an hour. I got there at 3pm. I ate a similar meal in the Roxbourogh tavern. Add a drought beer.

Andrena F.,"Schenectady, NY",100,66,96,2.0,5/10/2017,"Let's start with I deserve this crappy meal because I was being lazy!  Who goes to Philly and eats dinner at TGIF's anyway?  So let's start with the positives- I was seated quickly and had a excellent server named Nay!  That's it it all goes to crap from here on in. I had the happy hour drink special called a mango boba Long Island ice tea. Though large. It didn't look anything like the picture and was a glass full of cheap liquor and these weird virtually flavorless bobas. I then waited over an hour for my equally unimpressive jack Daniels chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries that arrived cold. At this point feeling sorry for myself I ordered the Tennessee whiskey cake to go....why why Lord do you punish me so?  Word to the wise skip the cake too!   The two stars they earned are because of Nay. She was pleasant, observant handled my disappointing experience like a pro!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3

Mark M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,1.0,12/4/2017,"I'm actually in this Friday's right now  I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich and the chicken was thick but tough. Chicken breast should not be tough yaw! So you know I sent it back. Then I just decided something quick - And I ordered the loaded nachos with chicken and all this melted cheese/black beans. About 3-4 pieces of chicken could they spare another piece o God! The manager order this me because the server sent him over. My son enjoyed his food,but as usual I'm leaving Friday's disappointed! No  time soon will I becoming here. Another waste of cash . Last time I was here I was food disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
Wender O.,"Philadelphia, PA",133,103,75,4.0,6/13/2017,"I really like TGI Friday's Endless Appetizers for $10. I think its a sweet deal especially if you're with a little group of people. The service was great and our waitress, Shout outs to Aaliyah!, made our whole experience here great!. She was very personable and very accommodating ( we had three small children and needed a high chair). Our food took a little while to get there as there was a very crowded "" after work"" rush that swamped the staff and kitchen I assumed but not a big deal. I would not mind coming back here but maybe during the first few days of the week, the weekend will be reserved for somewhere less populated on thursdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
Shenitra S.,"North Baltimore, Baltimore, MD",0,4,5,1.0,6/22/2017,The most unprofessional and unsanitary place ever VERY LOUD MAJORITY NOISE WAS FROM THE STAFF SCREAMING... Waiters trying to take numbers for personal dates..smh The trash can overflowed as it sat next to the ice barrel.Finally when staff moved the trash can because i was watching another staff pulled it right back next to the ice barrel that the staff was using to serve drinks..... No one used the ice scooper at.   When staff decided to finally change the trash bag a piece of trash fell in the ice barrel and he left it there.  The next waiter needed ice for a table and used the cup to scoop with one hand and the other hand to grab the trash out of the ice barrel and put it back in the trash .... My waiter comes and say i saw you watching so i used the ice scooper ...... That was enough for me .....This place was horrible on a Thursday night at 9pm i can only imagine other nights..

Sofia V.,"Philadelphia, PA",68,43,73,1.0,8/4/2016,"Service & Staff- Unacceptably incompetent   Food- Pretty darn good!  Establishment- Shut this place down!  Walked in & waited at the hostess station to be seated or greeted. No one there for 10 mins. Flagged down a few people who seemed to be lost & still in training mode. Surveying the restaurant I see there are a handful of tables occupied. Plenty were empty.  Finally we were seated at a table. Sat there for 10-15 mins until a waitress came. I'm already frustrated from earlier, so this just raised my frustration up another notch, although I TRY my hardest to understand & be patient. People who were seated right next to us were seated AFTER us & received their apps and entrees BEFORE us. WHY? Because our waitress spent 15-20 mins at a table with older woman explaining about their split checks all the while dancing & singing with no urgency in the world.  Our entrees came out WITH the app (which was cold) & 10 mins later the kids meal which was ordered before the rest. At this point I'm just ready to leave. We explained that what happened was not ok & the waitress assured us she'll talk to the manager & possibly comp something. Check came & no comp on total bill. Pointed this out & she said ""Ugh flagging down this manager is so hard!"" Ummmm......that's not my problem! They took it off & she had the audacity to say our total bill keeps going down (the free entree & now the comp) AVOID! No amount of coupon, promotion or whatever is worth the horrible service you will receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
Karissa D.,"Meriden, CT",4,6,3,1.0,9/2/2017,"Terrible service. We were in here for an unneeded 2 hrs. It took about 40 mins just to get our drinks n which then the waitress said they ran out of one the beverages that were requested. I asked for my burger on the green (no bun), add spicy mustard n white cheese; the meal was brought out on the bun, yellow cheese no mayo. I should of been asked if I wanted yellow cheese if there was no white before it being brought out to me. Then they also came out saying they ran out of spicy mayo. My turkey burger was bland and I ended up sending it back. Would never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3
DiAnna M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,10,10,4.0,4/23/2017,"Came here after a long 2 hour church service . Surprisingly almost empty . Got seated right away .We immediately  went to the endless app menu. Of course it is limited to your usual boneless wings , meatballs , flatbread . The usual . We took the hate .All together We tried the pot stickers , boneless buffalo wings , bbq chicken flat bread and the meatballs . Everything was good except the meatballs being all pork and the texture being mooshy . The portions also get smaller as you go a long or at least that's what it seemed like (conspiracy theory ) . All in all not a bad experience and the drinks were made well as well . We got the Crown Apple Sour and A long Island . Staff was friendly and quick .

From the time we entered and were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait in an empty restaurant to the time the runner took our order and gave it to another table to the person that resembled a kitchen employee light up a blunt openly in the restaurant, all I can say is this place has consistently nosedived in service, quality  AND experience!  It SUCKED YAK NUTS!

Kat C.,"Philadelphia, PA",56,89,385,1.0,4/1/2016,"I should've known better.  Generally, I like Friday's. It's easily family friendly and the place I enjoy sharing crispy green bean fries with my nieces and nephew. It's also a chain restaurant so there's a level of cheap fun that I can get in the mood for every now and then.  So, I had a particular taste for the green beans (minus the family) and upon arrival; we waited about 25 minutes to be seated with the view of more/less 20 empty and prepped tables in sight. There was a lobby full of people waiting... And a ton of empty chairs. Servers were observed to be huddled in the bathroom touching up their outfits, others grooming their beards in the back mirror, and then a few were just... standing there.  Once seated; we were approached by 3 different servers who couldn't figure out if they were serving our table or not. At one point, a server introduced herself as our waiter and just after she asked for our order, she then walked off to tend to her phone just a few steps behind us. Then server #2 came back around and also asked us for our order and when I informed her of server #1, she plopped down and stretched herself over our table - probably also groaning at the same ratchet-behind behavior we were experiencing. Then she walks off and a couple minutes later server #3 steps on the scene in attempt to pick up the pieces.  These dang green beans fries.  What the eff. Luckily, Friday's food should be the same, and it was so I can't really say much about that but if you saw how chaotic this place was; you'd probably question everything.  Moreover, just as we're getting ready to pay - Drake's ""Hotline Bling"" gets blasted over the sound system and to our right are two women droppin', woppin', and twerking as Drake reminisces on the girl who used to call him his cell phone.  Again, I didn't expect this to be some magical luxe place; I used a lot of my hard earned work study money there while I was in college but dang. This particular Friday's has grown to be especially terrible. Did I mention I was awarded the ""Maverick"" Yelp Badge for checking in at this place? This badge is awarded because I was living life on the edge with no fear of ""danger"" - That's how bad; it's a risky move to come here, Yelp will even pat you on the back. So - you probably didn't need to be told but if you have a tolerance for a complete (insert poop emoji here)-show. Knock yourself out. You might be entertained at the very least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3

Albert S.,"Cambridge, MA",167,71,37,1.0,10/24/2016,"I was here last summer and just last week. Both times, the service just sucked and was incredibly slow on a weekday lunch. It took around half an hour to even get some of our drinks (and be told that the Oktoberfest beers couldn't be served for whatever reason). I got the Jack Daniels burger (which comes either pink or not pink). It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it all. The buns seemed stale and the meat was oddly syrupy-sweet (maybe that's what Jack Daniels is supposed to do?). The best part of this meal were the one and a half pieces of mozz sticks I had. I don't think anyone I was with finished their meals.

Shane J.,"Philadelphia, PA",122,288,226,3.0,4/26/2015,Fridays - well - what are you going to say - it's one of the BEST chain restaurants that are at a good serviceable price point for many people who may not be able to access quality food - speaking to my fellow foodies.  Because I have a location near my home - I would use it as a meeting location when I was dating.  It is good for cheap appetizers and drinks.  Usually the place is packed no matter when you go - this location - the service is ok - could use improvement.  The sound level is high and the people (customers) are obnoxious!!  I am usually in and out and would never dream of going here Fri & Sat!!   Good thing - you can count on regular menu items and usually at reasonable prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=40

More than half the tables were empty?  When we were seated, the waitress asked if we were ready to order and walked away without a response from either of us.  The reason, a group of guys who should have been cut off were shoving and yelling and throwing beer mugs.  After the whole kitchen staff came out with their phones, the server came back and took our order.  These guys were not asked to leave by management and other guest even began yelling. Some more yelling, mediocre food, a lot of F bombs and $40 later we were ready to leave.  But, the manager was blocking the door because the group was now in the foyer pushing one another again.  Read and trust the reviews, STAY AWAY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=40

Janice L.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,32,126,1.0,1/28/2017,"This is a very busy location but it is poorly managed. There typically is a 20"" or longer wait for a table, yet there are many tables actually open. Instead of using the open tables, they just make people wait. The wait staff is not motivated and it takes a long time to be served. We waited 30"" for a table and it took another 15"" to get a waitress at the table. A manager actually came to our table to ask how everything was not even noticing we had no drinks or anything at the table. When I let him know we were waiting for a waitress, he took our drink order and apologized but that's where his intervention ended. It's took another 15 minutes to get our drinks from our waitress but it wasn't the correct drink order. She took it back and took another 10"" to bring the right drinks! Basically, we waited 40 minutes for a server.  I will say that the food was very good and cooked appropriately but there was no additional service. No napkins, no refills, no visit from the server at all. We did notice the server spending some time with some gentleman at another table flirting away for a good 15 minutes so maybe that's what she was spending her time doing instead of waiting on tables. There are a lot of people who sit at the bar and it is a little loud but this could be a great place if it was better managed and the waitstaff were interested in actually serving the customers who were dining.

Sorry to say, I don't remember our server's name, but he was a very tall man, bald and was extremely pleasant the whole time.  They offer lunch specials, but they are printed in the back of the HUGE menu they have. I can only assume it so people order from the regular menu. I had the chicken fingers lunch special and got to choose from an additional add on (Bruschetta, Salads, Soup).

Another 10 minutes went by, the server was very nice and took our order.   We ordered our appetizers and main entrees. When the food to arrive at our tables, we received our main entrees first. By the time we were finishing up our main entree, the appetizers arrived next. It wasn't a big deal but we were all anticipated on having the appetizers to come out first.  There were a few times that we asked to have our plates exchanged and one of the staff members did not come back with new plates. So, we decided to let that slide. Another time, we asked to combine our checks since we sat at two different tables and the server came back with two separate checks. We wanted to consolidate our bill onto one single payment.  Overall, our dining experience here at this T.G.I. Fridays was abysmal. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately, there were a few too many unacceptable errors.

Compare to other TGI Friday's that I've been to, this one can be really crowded and too loud. This is definitely a place if you want to really have fun with your friends and get loud. I wouldn't recommend this place for like a date or eat with your kids.  I guess the bad reviews about their service is when the place is crowded, and waiters can't keep up and became lousy.

From start to finish, I was thoroughly unimpressed and disappointed with the service. Nobody was rude, but it's clear that the servers either never learned how to properly care for customers, or they didn't practice what they had learned about how to handle customers. The two people at the front area ignored me and kept chatting with a person who had already been helped. After a third person (the only professional one) came over, we actually got seated. We waited 20 minutes for our food. My salad was dressed incorrectly and clearly not checked by the server. He then promptly disappeared for 20 minutes, only running past us to do the fastest check in I've ever seen. I did manage to see 3 staff members playing with their cellphones, at least 4 stopping to watch the TVs. Seemed to be more servers watching TV than doing work. Shameful.

We were in the restaurant for 10 minutes before we left due to poor service. Upon arriving we were told that there would be a five minute wait before a table was available. Sure. No problem, many people might be coming out for Sunday Brunch. After being seated and given our menus, we noticed that there were several empty tables in the restaurant. So why the wait? We decide to look through our menus, and as I am making suggestions about starters/appetizers, I'm getting strange looks from my parents. Apparently they were missing pages from their menu. By this time, no server has come to our table to introduce themselves or take drink orders. My father returns to the hostess desk up front and request two new menu (without missing pages) and he is given two new menu. After looking through these menu, they notice there are still missing pages! (Shouldn't someone be checking these menus).  During this time we are seated in the patio/glass enclosed area and we are burning up due to the sunlight. AND still no server has come to our table. No ice water...NOTHING!

For those reasons alone I have no interest in coming here unless its on a Friday or Saturday night. The food is solid at times and a major letdown at others. Depends on how much the waiter/waitress likes you. The majority of my experiences have been pretty ok. I've even had a waiter flirt with me in front of my father. Now that's bold.  For food I suggest either the Sizzling Parmesan Crusted Chicken or Sizzling Chicken and Cheese. These dishes have yet to fail me.  Don't bother with the steaks or the ribs. Save that money and go to a legit steakhouse. The drinks are usually strong and not too bad a hit on the wallet. They have a large variety which is always nice. It definitely is the place for the grown (but not always so sophisticated) to hit up before going out. Some even make this their night out.  One thing I did like is that I can still take my younger siblings (12,14) here on a Saturday after 10, and not worry about reckless behavior, profanity, and or drunk messiness. Maybe that happens after 12...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
Anthony W.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,273,18,1.0,1/29/2011,"I came in here 1 time and was met with absolute HOSTILITY! This was the meanest waitress I've ever seen. The only person I've ever seen that was meaner was some dude at a South St. pizza shop. It's like everybody was visibly mad that we came in. It wasn't quite closing time yet, but not far from it. At one point I asked for a refill and the waitress gave me the GRIZZLY! (Read: evil eye) And then she asked me, ""Did I just look at you some kinda way."" Usually, I would be upset, but I thought it was funny. I was a bit younger too. I wouldn't tolerate this now. Looking back, we should've left. I don't know what kind of drama was going down in the kitchen, but something was up. I had a similar experience down the street when Denny's was still open and the waitress that time was actually a classmate. The food was up to par (which is pretty good), but damn I wish I could youtube this experience. It would go viral. If there was ever a time to leave without tipping that would've been it and we still had the decency to leave one. She should go apply to work at Penndot. She'd be a natural.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100

Rose V.,"Philadelphia, PA",24,84,16,1.0,2/7/2011,"First time I went there the service was okay, but this it was awful.  The waitress did not even introduce her name to us nor did she even paid attention to us, the only time she did look at us was when she was talking our order.  Another thing, bring your own drink there too because to get the waitresses attention took us about 15-20 minutes (no exaggeration).  The crazy part is that this is all done on a Monday, there were no events going on, not even busy where we customers had felt neglected. Don't go here, especially when you are starving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
Laura N.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,28,,2.0,1/7/2014,The staff is okay at best. The place is always jam packed so I guess that explains why they take forever. I don't think I've ever been here and haven't had to wait to be seated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
Jess S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",132,141,195,2.0,9/5/2012,"all i can say is NO.  first of all, i felt like we were eating outside because of all the bugs.. including the huge spider that i found crawling up my fiance's arm after we had been there for a while.  but that's not even the worst.  our server had no clue when it came to bar drinks... my fiance ordered a Dos Equis, and he was clueless.. then came back almost TEN MINUTES later to tell him they didn't have ""that dos drink"" (that was in the menu..) so would he want something else.  Refills were so slow, even to be offered.  My food was no good, but that could've just been the certain item I picked, which also I know isn't the server's fault.. but still.  He then asked us if we were going to be a while because he was done a while ago, and he had 5 kids at home he had to take care of.  i mean, i get it, you want to go home- i wait tables and bartend too, so i know, but i never tell my tables that!  he did tell us he wasn't trying to rush us, but what would YOU call it?  we still tipped him good because of both of our experience in the business, but oh boy... he needs to redo his training or something.  Also, that place is more like a local hang-out than a restaurant, and i think that's what really did it for us.  we were sitting near the door, and wow... the people just hanging out were ridiculous!  and i'm pretty sure they were off-duty employees, because they kept running back to the kitchen and they seemed to know everyone.  But they were using really terrible language (and they were REALLY loud about it), and just being obnoxious.  And it was pretty clear that the managers didn't care because they were around, just not putting a stop to the ""party"" going on at the door.  But honestly, these guys (one in particular who apparently is there ALL the time) were obnoxious- running around, being way over the top, and just loud.  REALLY RUDE and didn't exactly add to the dinner date.  Honestly, all the stuff with out server (who WAS nice, just not a good server) probably would have been more easily over looked if I wasn't already irritated with all of that.  somebody really needs to put a stop to that.. I've been waiting tables for 5 years now and I have never worked anywhere where the managers would allow that from any employee- on the clock or not.  It REALLY takes away from any kind of positive experience you could even hope to get from that place.    On the other hand, Avia (not sure on the spelling??) is super sweet!  she took over for our server once we settled our bill and continued ordering.. my fiance ate there for lunch earlier in the week and she was his server, so once he saw her he made mention of being in there before and how well she did her job, so i'm sure that had something to do with her taking us on, but none-the-less, we appreciated her willingness and attention, and for that, we way over tipped her, but she deserved it more than he did.  so next time we go, we'll be asking to sit in her section for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100

Amazing B.,"Ridley Park, PA",0,13,,1.0,12/27/2014,This place was absolute shit. The service was HORRIBLE. The waitress Stephani was barely seen. Our drinks sucked and we didn't even get napkins or a sorry for the wait. She was back there with the cook holding hands cause I freaking saw her when she needed to be doing her damn job. I been to other Fridays and it was great example in Delaware. This one is ghetto and they can seriously give to shits about there customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
BOBBY K.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,4,,1.0,3/21/2011,"My buddy & I went here last night around 10pm. He warned me we'll be waiting forever to eat, and that was far from music to my ears, especially because I left the house with bbq ribs on my mind, and hunger pains in my stomach. Well, long story short, the host sat us, and after 30 minutes, no one ever came to our table, everyone around us was complaining about the service, and one older lady even jokingly told me and my buddy, ""The next time you come here make sure you bring your own sandwiches & food to eat, because you're gonna be waiting forever! We walked out... I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! Customer service was non-existent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
Robert J.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,51,86,4.0,9/9/2014,"A customer since my days in college, I recently visited TGI Fridays on a business trip and the service continues to be excellent. The establishment has gone through a make over from the late 80's but it is still a warm, friendly atmosphere to dine with anyone. The menu has expanded substantially to include city local favorites like the bread pretzels and choice of mini bites which will fill your appetite. The signature dishes are still a demand such as the glazed salmon the grilled very well seasoned chicken and the burgers. The drink menu especially the wine selection has top choices.  I would recommend a Riesling with any of there fish dishes as it has a bold buttery taste to compliment. If you are healthy conscious then you can breath because the have a meal to complement your diet. I live in NYC but when in Philadelphia and near City avenue, aka,City line avenue, I will always stop by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
Kndlz S.,"Charlotte, NC",0,19,,1.0,12/6/2014,"Wow! Would have been nice to even try to order food like some of the other reviews. Yet, I never got the opportunity. Their staff has been so scathingly terrible that this is my first and last review and the last time I'll ever try this restaurant. In the past I've always been met with the long wait to sit and order food for no apparent reason similar to other reviews. The final straw was last night when After nearly a year of not eating here I tried to place an Order for carry out. I was met with hearing the hostess' conversation with co-workers for about 15 sec before she actually even gave a greeting! Really??!  She was not cordial in anyway. In addition, she transferred me to the kitchen to make my order and no one ever picked up! After two attempts, and complaining to the hostess (which obviously went nowhere) I gave up. Never will go back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
Crys L.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,47,24,1.0,7/31/2013,"Wish I could give this place higher stars, but just can't. The service is usually slow, but the food comes out pretty good. Except they NEVER include the jalapeno cornbread when you order the jack daniels dishes. It's almost like they think you won't notice it's missing?? Hubby and I kept returning tho, because we like the steak and shrimp scampi combo plates. Well, we have finally given up on this location. Not sure what is going on in the kitchen, but I ordered a steak medium-rare and had to send it back THREE times because it was well-done! That's it for us, farewell Fridays...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
Kimberly P.,"Seattle, WA",146,447,143,2.0,7/9/2007,"The Fridays on City Line Avenue is very noteworthy indeed. The service SUCKS. And the funny thing is that I work there. Yes, I am amazed at my co-workers lack of respect for their job and their customers. This is the only restaurant that I have been to that I have seen a customer ask a waiter for help and for the waiter to respond, ""I am not your waiter, that's not my job. You need to ask your waiter for that."" Granted, there are a few good servers. But the majority lounge around in the kitchen, avoiding work and waiting on their tables at all costs.  Yes, the food may be good at Fridays but if you are looking for exceptional service , look elsewhere. Or just ask for me when you come. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-3?start=100
