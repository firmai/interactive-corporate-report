So I went on a Thursday last week and was super disappointed. They don't have the same special. The crowd was non existant, it didn't have a great atmosphere or even nice loud music. Most tgifs I go to country wide have almost club music playing its nice and loud and they always have people in even on workdays. When I went to this Tgif it was like going to a funeral.

317,Lori G.,"Las Vegas, NV",130,16,,4.0,2013-10-05,"So this review is for TWO visits.  The first was on September 24 at 1:30pm.  Hubby and I were going to DMV (yuck!) and felt like we needed a good meal to build up our stamina for what we knew would be an interminable wait.  This was a Tuesday afternoon and, as we suspected, it was pretty quiet.  We stood for about 5 minutes while the manager talked on his cell phone.  A male waiter walked past us twice without greeting.  Finally the manager got off the phone and said, ""Hello.  Let me get the hostess.""  Finally a young lady str-o-o-o-olled over and asked if we wanted to be seated in the bar.  We said no thank you, we would like a table or booth.  Without even looking, she informed us that it would be at least a 10 to 15 minute wait (on top of the now 10 minutes that we had been standing there.)  We said thanks but no thanks and left. But, because I LOVE Jack Daniels glaze on steak, I convinced my husband to try it again yesterday.  Once again we arrived around 1:30pm and, again, the hostess was MIA, but eventually (about 5 minutes this time) she arrived and offered us a table.  Once seated (she seated us without eating utensils), Brittany, our server, was right there.  We started off the meal with chips and salsa, gave our order and started a REALLY ENJOYABLE dining experience.  Hubby got the Bruschetta Chicken dinner (a favorite of his) and I ordered the Jack Daniels flat iron steak.  His meal was perfect (he ate every mouthful.)  Unfortunately, my side of broccoli was cold (cold enough that butter wouldn't melt), but the baked potato and steak was AWESOME!  I ordered the steak medium rare and it was spot on!  Everything was delivered fast and Brittany, our server, attended to us without being too attentive.  It was a really good meal and a nearly perfect restaurant visit.  So now we will visit again and report if the first visit was an anomaly or if the second visit was just luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=240,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.288,2.4

Four big soft pretzels - two for me, two for my son. My son ordered the 6oz petite sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes and seasoned fries. Perfectly cooked sirloin (medium well) topped with maison butter. My son enjoyed it a lot! The mashed potatoes he devoured first though. Really hot (temperature) and tasty (according to him!) I ordered the new All American Stacked Burger! Holy moly! I've never had this item before tonight - and was immediately impressed! Two 3.6oz fresh beef patties, grilled and stacked on  leaf lettuce, sliced tomato, pickles, and 1,000 Island dressing with melty cheese and two strips of peppered bacon (We back our bacon with fresh coarse black pepper) all on a soft brioche bun!

305,Daisy D.,"Hemet, CA",0,4,,1.0,2013-11-25,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Yesterday (11/24) I decided to go to TGI Friday to celebrate my birthday. It was big party so I called in advance to make reservations for 6 p.m. After arriving, our table was already set up so luckily we didn't have to wait at all. Our waitress (which was being trained by another waiter) took care of us. After the trainee introduced herself, the trainer came to our table and introduced himself as well and said, ""Vanessa will be taking care of you guys, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. I will be like a shadow overlooking her work"".   The trainee then started to take our drink orders. About 10 minutes later, we finally got our drinks; a couple of them were wrong. The trainee took the wrong drinks back and did not bring them back until about 15 minutes later. Everyone had finished their first drink, while 2 people were still left waiting on their first. After waiting nearly 20-30 minutes, the appetizers started coming out. Only half of our table got their appetizers on time.  Several entrees were starting to come out, whereas the other half of the table had not gotten their appetizers yet. After complaining and waiting another 15 minutes, the other half of the table finally got their appetizers. One half of the table that got their entrees served first had already been done with their food, as the other half of the table hadn't even received their entrees. Despite that, after asking the waiters/waiter for A1 Sauce, they had told us they ran out.  There were 15 people in our party and each one of us had at least 1 thing wrong with the drinks, appetizer, or entrees. In one case in particular, a gal asked for a well done steak, when the steak was brought out it was undercook. The waitress took the steak back and 15 minutes later brought it back out; the steak was still undercook. The side orders were wrong on nearly half of the plates, also the food was cold and the fries were cold as well as old.  The onsite manager came out and apologized for the inconvenience and offered deserts free of charge. Moments later, the waitress comes to our table to recap everything everyone ordered to generate our bills.  Shouldn't the waitress already know what we ordered? At last, after waiting nearly 40 MINUTES after asking for our tab, our bills came out. Once again more than half of these bills were incorrect!!!  We got to the restaurant around 6:15-6:20 p.m.; we got our first drinks around 6:40 p.m.; half of our appetizers around 7:30 p.m.; the other half of the other appetizers around 7:50 p.m.; half of our entrees around 7:50 p.m.; the other half of the entrees around 8:20 p.m. and our bill around 9:30 p.m. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! The only person that truly helped us out was the bartender (Amy). Why she helped us out, I don't know. Not even the trainee's trainer came out to apologize. I do not blame the trainee, but I do blame the trainer, he should have done his job by overlooking at the trainee's work or taken responsibility for her mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=240,2.44,2.44,2.44,1.7320000000000002,2.44

As I waited for the Jack Daniels ribs to be cooked I ordered a Third shift on draft. 3rd Shift on draft is awesome at this TGIF! John was quick and courteous and I got the ribs which were $20.00 and went home to eat them. Upon eating them I thought they were good with the slightly sweet and spicy flavour of the JD sauce. Ribs themselves weren't the best or worst but in the middle. JD sauce was very tasty. Ginger lime slaw was okay and I really loved the Steak fries side with cheese! Overall it was a good experience.

One starter came out and we didn't see the rest until about ten minuets after and no plates. When the lady finally brought the rest over they all arrived at once and with the two mains also. I ordered a steak with rice and fries. The fries seemed to have been cooked but was cold and had that texture of left over fast food. The steak was so over cooked that it was bending the folk and was also cold. The rice however was hot and cooked perfectly, So I know that it wasn't the servers fault. The rest of the food was also cold and we ordered something in a cheese sauce, I'm not even sure what it was ment to be but the sauce on top had skinned over and had to have been sitting for a good ten minuets under heat in order for it to do that. It was like popping a blister when we put a folk in it. I've sent back food about four or five times in my life and this was by far the worst. It was so bad that I cannot believe that somebody would actually have even tried to send it. I wouldn't have fed it to a dog.  Overall the service is average, the food is so bad that I was laughing at it and the kitchen staff need to raise the standards.

Well first off, the waitress took over 20 mins to get to our table just to take our drink order.

I ordered the JD sampler and my bf ordered the steak and salmon. Food was just terrible. Point blank. The ribs were tough, dry, and bland. The Asian chicken strips were burned. The shrimp was cold (yet it's meant to be Cajun fried shrimp??). His steak was not cooked the way he ordered (medium well but came out rare) and the salmon was just okay, no flavor to it. Neither of us actually managed to finish more than half our plates coz it was so bad. At no point during our dinner did the waitress come by to refill our drinks or take our plates away - we had to ask another staff member to bring us the check and remove the dishes. Made sure to leave as soon as possible after paying. Did not tip since we felt she did not deserve it for terrible service. My advice: don't bother dining here at all.

After suffering through the first slider I moved on to the pretzels because I just couldn't eat another one. The ""pretzels"" were more like bread sticks painted brown to look the color of the pretzels. The bread itself had that freezer burn taste and the cheese dip had some kind of mint in it, which made it taste horrible.

Friday's a chance a couple of times, I was so close to giving it two stars, maybe even three because of surprisingly good service from a server who actually might have been a manager, but my most recent visit proved to me that this location may not deserve to be a dining option in Temecula.  Yes, they have endless appetizers, and yes, they have Jack Daniel's sauce (they skimp on it though), and yes, they even have really good Happy Hour drink and appetizer specials that extend through the night during football season. I'll give them that. But the service...the service here ruins the dining experience, as it would anywhere. The last time I came for Happy Hour, the bartender who served me was either in a bad mood or poorly trained in customer service. It seemed like ordering was inconveniencing him somehow, and twice he came back to tell me I had to order something else because the beer I asked for from the menu wasn't in stock at the restaurant. The food came out okay, but nothing was enticing me to stay.  Not long after I got my check, there was some kind of ruckus going on at the front of the bar near the kitchen and that bartender was yelling at another server about customers. Not just raising his voice, but shouting at her with very animated gestures while she tried to calmly take it. I'm not sure what it was about, but whatever the issue was should have been handled elsewhere and not out in the open for customers to witness. It was very unprofessional and surely made people uncomfortable. I did not stick around to see how management handled the situation, but if they can't keep employees from exhibiting this kind of behavior, then they need to restructure or not be in business.

Place still looks good, staff was friendly and it was cool to see them dressed up for Halloween. We got the Jack Daniels sampler, hubby got the Chicken Cobb Salad and I got some clam chowder. Sampler was yummy, though plates would of been nice because it was nice and freshly hot. Clam Chowder was gross, I only took one bite and that was enough. It didn't even taste like clam chowder, it was sour and had a really odd after taste. I sent it back and got a house salad instead. Hubby's salad was OK but, usually the items in a Cobb are chopped well the Chicken was like chunks and not bite sized chunks either. We also ordered the Tennessee Whiskey Cake, which was really good. Our waitress Ashley was very nice and comped the salad, which was very nice of her, as well as taking the chowder off our ticket. That's the only other reason we gave this place a star, besides the dessert.  Pretty much will not go back, quality does not match the price at all.

Ordered 2 Cobb salads with soft bacon and my steak was cold hubbys chicken was dry. I'm mean really how do you mess up a Cobb salad? Saw our server 2x when she took our order and when I had to ask someone to send her over so we could pay. When she dropped off check we waited again so we ended up just leaving the card there and left.  With so many good restaurants in the area I'm surprised this place is the way it is.

Walked in with my bf & when we asked the hostess about a booth, her only response was ""none are available"" ... After simply staring at her for 15 seconds with no further response from her I have to ask her, ""How long is the wait for a booth????"" To which she responds ""... Well, I just SAT everyone so.. Depends how long they take to leave ... Mm .. 30 mins"" O.K. We walk into the bar area and find not one but two open booths (these were not self seating). AHEM... Obviously the hostess is either beyond lazy OR completely incompetent at her job .. More likely both. After we are seated we listen to our server at the next booth chatting it up with someone she obviously knows about what kind of diapers her kids use -for a full 5 mins. She finally shows her face at our table.. We ask about the endless appetizers (WHICH is on a different menu-that they didn't even offer us until we asked for it) and she drops off the appetizer menu -DOESN'T bother to ask IF we might like a drink, and goes back to the next booth for ANOTHER 5 mins to talk about damn diapers. At this point we had enough & simply walked out. Will definitely NEVER be back. This location looks run down & we thought it was closed on first pulling up. I'm sure it will be closed shortly with service like this. Should have checked Yelp first. Don't bother with this place.. Just walk right next door to KARL STRAUSS.

We got our first appetizers within 15 minutes. Not an awful wait, but stuff was missing. The potato skins looked awful. Little to no cheese on most, 1-2 bacon bits on each, no chives, they hardly put sour cream in the dish. We also had mozzarella sticks but those are hard to mess up. We put in our next order as soon as we got them...  An hour after placing our order, we'd been sitting there for 50 of that with no food, a small pile of wings get there with hardly any sauce (supposed to be jack Daniels sauce) as well as our other appetizer. Great. Eat that and we have our next order placed, within 20 minutes.  Another hour and it gets there.

My husband and I took my kids there for dinner for my youngest son's 11th birthday. My 11 year old absolutely loves TJI Fridays. Our first waitress was awesome, very polite and respectfully, but when she walked away to get our drinks, another waitress walked up and told us that it was our waitress' ""make or break day"" and that if she did even one thing wrong to let this waitress know and our waitress would be fired. Which I thought was extremely unprofessional, you do not tell this information to customers, customers are there to dine. The unprofessional waitress then came back to our table and said she would be our new waitress because the other girl ""didn't pass"". Again, rude and unprofessional. Our food was brought to our table about 45 minutes later and (with the exception of my husband's) every order had something wrong. I ordered the steak and lobster, the waitress had spilled the lobster butter all over my entire plate so all of my food was covered in butter and she didn't offer to fix it. My son ordered the JD burger, the onions were raw not grilled, the Patty was dry with no flavor. My birthday boy ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp, there were absolutely no shrimp on his plate and the chicken was so dry it tasted like cardboard. I called for the server to come to our table and she completely ignored me, we then hit the call server button on our table and she walked passed us 3 times and just kept walking. The manager came by and I stopped her and told her everything. She offered to bring my son some shrimp and take 20% off our bill. When they brought my sons shrimp it was not cooked they way it was supposed to be and when he took a bite of one he said it didn't taste right and almost vomited. My husband tasted and spit it out and asked me to taste it. I tasted and spit it out... THE SHRIMP WAS ROTTEN!!!!! I then went to put a little salt on my flavorless steak and the top was not screwed on so my steak was covered in salt. We checked the pepper and the same thing. The manager remade my birthday boys entire meal but offered nothing for any of the other food. When we got our bill, she only took 20% off my sons plate and we were charged for 2 large juices when we had only received 2 small juices. So the manager said that she would take one of the juices off the bill, however she only took $2.39 off the bill when each juice we were charged $2.99. On top of all of this, the waitress never once came back to our table to check on us. Unfortunately we did not read the YELP reviews before going there... HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!

210,Nha Truc L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",29,3,2.0,1.0,2016-09-05,"Today is LABOR DAY and there was not much of a crowd tonight in the restaurant. My family and I had to wait to be seated. (For 15 mins and there were plenty of tables! There were only 3 party's other than us there!) We were assigned next to a window that bird droppings, not one, not two, but three. (That's so gross!) After getting our orders, we waited for 45 minutes for our food. (Okay, what happen there? If there was common sense is to why that would be understandable.) Waiter was not visible for some time. By the time we finally got our food, it was warm/cold. (Okay,  our food was done quite some time, where was the waitress?) Asked for a re-fill several times. (The waitress had knowledge that, but kept doing other things until 10 minutes later she finally refill'd my child's drinks. Now if it was busy, then it would have made sense.) Waiting for the waiter to split the bill took quite sometime too. Pretty much for our experience there, we had wait for everything. It has been years since I last came to eat TGIF.  I think I would rather continue eating else where like Red Robbin (They have given me the best service so far, and I mean best and on top of that their food as well!)

Came in with my wife and son at  approx 12:30pm on sunday oct 9th.  Upon walking in we waited about 7 minutes before we were acknowledged by a hostess or anyone. We were then sat and another 10 minutes went by before anyone came to serve us.  In fact, after the hostess passed by us 2 times ahe ended up asking us if she could get us drinks while we continued to wait. Saddest part was the restaurant was pretty empty! Sodas were totally flat. Server finally came and explained the deals. We asked to immediately place an order of french fries and a slider for our son. She did that then came back to take our oder. We each ended up doing the $10 endless apps. After about 35-40 minutes the burger and fries came out and the burger was burnt to a crisp. The cheese on top was even black and it wasnt even hot! Completely inedible.  French fries were cold and stale.  The waitress came back and went to get him a new one. That took another 15 mins. Still none of our foot came out yet tables who csme 15 mins after ours were being seved 8 full sized entrees. Finally someone brought food,  yet it was for a different table. We waited pver an hour and 15 and received 1 plate that wasnt hot or even coated in sauce (wings) we ended up walkin out because the manager wasnt doing a damn thing to fix it. Finally the GM told her to comp the meal, which was obvious because we didnt eat! The 3 of us left starving and furious.  The manager even told me point blank ""ya the endless apps is actually the worst thing to get"" then why the hell do you promote it?!? There is so much more that happened but it would take forever to write.  Another  thing, every single person working there  was qalking around with the most miserable look on their faces.

The appetizers were delicious as well as my finace's salad. When our food came out it was hot, BUT there someting missing from mine (i ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta, there was no shrimp. I told Kassandra where is the shrimp, she replied ""its in there just scarce"", my reply was no I'm moving the pasta around and replied ""look no shrimp just all chicken"", she replied again ""i just saw one!, I said no there is no shrimp. She replied ""sorry about that can I just bring you out the shrimp, ""thats fine I replied"". So I waited and waited and no shrimp I ate my food cause i didnt want it to get cold. After 15 mins she came back and said they are preparing the shrimp now. In my mind im like wtf.

Then we waited 6 minutes later the waiteress comes out with another bowl of pasta BUT! It was not my Cajun Chicken and Shrimp with fettuccine, it was Penne pasta no sauce with  just shrimp on it.WTF !i told her what is this, this is not my order I told her never mind you ruined my night.  Take it back.

98,Russ U.,"San Jacinto, CA",342,20,20.0,2.0,2016-12-28,"Went here on Christmas at the request of my kids who love the endless apps.  We arrived to be told there would be a 20 min wait for a table; we had driven 45min to get here (we kinda live in the sticks) so I needed to visit the men's room.  I walked through one of the main sections in the restaurant; of the 12 tables, 7 were either empty or needed busing because the guests had left; the next section over (this would be half the restaurant) was the same-less tables occupied than empty.  I understand not having the staff to seat all your tables and avoiding bad service, but you would think that Christmas is kind of a traditionally busy day for places that are open and a well managed place would be prepared. Restroom was tossed-no need to go further there. We were seated in 15 min, so they did well there; although it took the server being ""summoned"" with the tablet on the table to bring menus.  This is where things started to go off the rails.  There was no mention of the promotion in their weird new menus, nor was there a menu on the table for the endless apps promo.  After a few minutes of waiting on her to come back (did not see her ""serving"" either, just MIA - Female manager hanging out in drink station ""observing"" and doing nothing as well; we ""summoned"" the server via the button again.  She came by and I asked about the endless app promo.  She confirmed the promo was live and promptly went into an explanation as to ""how busy"" the kitchen was (again less than half tables occupied) and that it would be more than 20 min between ""app refills""; and suggested we order something else off the menu-and pointed out that if we wanted apps we should just order them off the menu because they were half priced?  I asked if she meant every time we ordered more chicken or pizza or whatever it would be atleast 20 min and she confirmed.  I said ""welp that is what we came for, you guys seem to be having some issues, I guess we will be leaving"" and we got up and left. The whole POINT of apps in a restaurant is that they are supposed to take little effort for the kitchen to push out; and if you have a promo like this, you would think they would have someone on the app station full time to keep them rolling out.  To then suggest ordering them off the menu is a terrible suggestion if for whatever reason they are having trouble getting them out-you just backed up your already messed up line more. I hate having to post a negative review for any business, I understand the hardships of people calling off etc; but to put so much money and effort into promoting a special that you try to drive people away from, and to see a manager ""chilling"" for over 5 min while the staff was allegedly overwhelmed, perplexed me.  Usually in the restaurant industry your manager is cappable of jumping in and helping in the kitchen if they are needed; and obviously should be able to help the wait staff. I know the server probably assumed we were looking for a ""cheap"" option and were not likely to tip well but she was wrong-we wound up at our local JITB and had such a fantastic experience there we tipped the person who served us $10-I mean heck it was Christmas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=40,1.84,1.84,1.84,1.768,1.8400000000000003

The same side of the kitchen that makes your before dinner salad is the same side of the kitchen that sends out half of your refill apps. As a former server there I can say that the reason you are not getting your refill sodas or FaceTime with your server is most likely because they are in the kitchen desperately trying to get an eta to get food out for either your table or another one seated around you.

Our waiter did just great, our problem was not with her but with the kitchen staff & how long we had to wait for our food.We waited about 15 min to get seated, then waited about 10 min before our server came around taking our drink orders. Which by then was after 7 so we just barely missed happy hour because of that. So we ordered our food right away when we placed the drink orders. It took nearly 45 minutes for us to get our food! We didn't order anything crazy just a burger,quesadilla,and fish&chips. We were about to cancel our order but we had already been waiting 30 min by that point so we toughed it out. We finally get our food which was just meh & I have any dipping sauce for my fish so I asked for ranch... That was another 20 min wait just for that! I didn't get it until I got up & asked the hostess in the from if she could help me out. We were clearly not pleased with the service which the server could tell & did apologize for it. I spoke to a manager who apologized & gave us a discount. She also said there were only TWO cooks working.

The service has always been slow and slower at times. The bartenders are the watiresses so if they are stuck behind the bar they don't have time to tend to your table.

21,Desiree G.,"Winchester, CA",33,2,2.0,1.0,2017-09-22,"$55 down the drain. My coworker and I decided to give TGI Fridays a shot tonight since neither of us had ever been here, and I'm thoroughly disappointed. It was a mess from the second we walked in. We stood in the entry way for at least 5 minutes before we came to the conclusion that we must just have to pick a seat. Meanwhile, at least three servers made eye contact with the two of us. They only decided to serve us when they saw that we decided to just go take a seat at one of the tables. Then came the food, we got the Jack Daniels appetizer sampler thing to split and two entrees. We also had ordered the nachos, but they never came. So for the sampler: the ribs were good, and shrimp was good, but the chicken strips were burnt and drowned in sauce. The Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta: the Alfredo was already separated, you could literally see the pools of orange grease all over the plate. Leading me to believe that they just have preportioned servings of the sauce just sitting in a cooler waiting to be heated up in a microwave. Sizzling chicken and cheese: coworker said the chicken had no flavor. Mind you, that plate was about $18 for two pieces of bland chicken atop a boiling puddle of cheese with two scoops of mashed potatoes plopped on the other side of the skillet. $18!!!! After an email coupon that eliminated the entire cost of one of the entrees, we still ended up with a bill of $45.01. Then with tip we payed $55. So irritating. Could have bought two whole 2 for $20 deals at Applebee's and the quality would have been 40x better. Can't believe how outrageously priced this disgusting food is.

2,Liz M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",69,26,20.0,1.0,2017-10-21,"So this is our 3rd time visiting this place. Both of our earlier visits were at night, and the experience was ok, but the food was good so we decided to try and go in today for lunch. Bad idea. It began when we first walked in. The host sat us in a table where 4 people would sit comfortably, (we're 5), but we took it because we were hungry and figured that wasn't a deal breaker for us. We then noticed the table was dirty, and instead of moving us, he came back with a wet cloth and let us know that it was 'sanitizer' and proceeded to clean the table half ass. Then and there should have been reason enough to leave, but again, having hungry kids made us try and make the best of the situation. So, waitress comes over, she seemed friendly enough and took our orders. I kid you not, 5 mins after we placed our order, she comes up to my 10 year old and says, ""Sweetie, we don't have any pepperoni for your pizza, is cheese ok?"" My son said ok and proceeded to wait for our food. Like 3 mins later, she comes back again and tells me, ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, we ran out of Brussel sprouts, is there something else you'd like instead?"" I had my heart set on it, but asked for a side salad. This was during lunch time, at 1pm, and already they were running out of their menu items. 25 mins passed, and we were contemplating leaving. I regret that we didn't after our food came out. I ordered a 2 for grill item, I chose a sirloin with parmesan crusted chicken. I swear to you, I don't know how small that chicken was, but it was even tinier than a chicken strip. I cut into it and it was rubbery. Sirloin was ok, but it had no seasoning whatsoever. My husband ordered that burger that comes with a wing on top, the wing was cold, almost as if they defrosted it, but not thoroughly. To top it off, our waitress continuously checked in on other diners, but not us. We are never going back there. Please save your money.

Overall the food was mediocre definitely not worth the price. The one thing we liked were the drinks. Other than that this place needs new recipes and a remodel for sure.

I thought this was a chain restaurant that i can just go to the bar, be carded and enjoy mild music and some drinks. So here's my experience... I enter, no one at the door, cool, so i walk in (with a friend) straight to the bar. Only 3 barstools left that i could see, so we take two of them. We proceed to order our drinks, but after we are asked if we have wristbands. Friend and i look at one another confused, so i try to ask where to get said wristband but could not hear the lady over the obnoxious music. So after that she just continues with the well and completely ignored us like we were fucking stupid. Go back towards the host stand to see where we were supposedly to get the wrist bands.. Of course now there's two security guards, or whatever they're supposed to be called. Asked them if they're the ones providing the wristbands. Of course they were. But we told them it was funny that no one was up front when we first entered. Security didnt seem to understand and just proceeded to tell us that we have to be 21 or over to be in the bar. NO SHIT DUDE!! We just didnt know it was card at the door cause none of you were there up front to take our IDs. Anyway, we both only had one drink each and left after dealing with all that.

However from the beginning of my visit if I hadn't been hungry I would have left. It took almost 15 minutes to get a table despite the fact they were many empty tables hadn't been cleared. The place was basically in shambles. As for my waiter I was fully aware it was his 3rd day a on the job as he told me at least 5 times during our entire interactions. I mentioned to him to stop telling me this over and over again he then didn't come back the table at all. I understand his inexperience however the person truly to be blamed is his supervisor for not training him well and not giving him the tools necessary to be successful. As for my food well the steak and broccoli were decent however my mashed potatoes tasted like glue when I brought it to his attention he did bring over his supervisor who offered to swap them out for something. I explained to her I was raised not to waste food and ate them anyway. What I did ask is for her to go in the kitchen herself and taste them. When I did get around to ordering dessert once it was placed it took almost 15 minutes for the cheesecake to arrive at that point I asked for it to go and I even had to ask a different person about its earlier status. The manager never came out to ask me about the rest of my meal nor did I see my waiter again. When I did use the self service machine to pay for my bill and didn't get a copy of my receipt I had to ask several people just for a copy of it which again took way to long. Also had to endure watching the table next to me experience the same issues but magnified because they had a large party.

My family recently went here on my brothers birthday & it was a completely horrible experience. Our waitress literally took about 10-15 min to greet us and take our order. I ordered an appetizer (some breadsticks) and it never even came out until about 30-40 minutes later (after our food even came out).

Definitely won't be returning nor recommending anyone else to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=40,1.4,1.83,1.864,,1.6580000000000001
6,Knd S.,"CA, CA",35,7,3.0,1.0,2017-12-23,Placed an order to go and I guess this is what you get. It looks like I ate half my meal and then packed the left overs. Definitely not worth the $15 for the amount you get.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2,1.36,1.83,1.864,,1.6420000000000003

14,Jordan D.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,6,,1.0,2018-01-13,"This place sucks so bad I would not even feed my dog the food. The waitress was not funny and her jokes were stupid. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium well, so the burger comes out first bit not bad second bit saw a little pink third bit its raw. Told the waitress this burger is raw I want it cooked more please. She replies ""oh a little to pink for you we can share it i like it"" and walks away. So I kind of sit there not knowing what to think, but I assumed that she was going to the kitchen to have a new one made well i was wrong i had to bring it to her attention once again. So she finally goes and has them make me a new one. Waited 25 minuets or longer... for a burger and let me tell you they must have cooked this thing the entire 25 minutes i was waiting because that sucker was like a hockey puck. So if this place wants to survive get new cooks and new management and finally some new waiters/waitresses that don't want to share the raw food that can make you sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2,1.56,1.8,1.868,,1.7040000000000004
3,Oscar V.,"Escondido, CA",1,32,7.0,5.0,2018-01-13,We came in 12 deep the wait was expected but not like other restaurants near by(2hr wait). Our server Sadie was amazing she was super friendly and very very very patient with my entire family. The food came out with no mistakes. Everyone enjoyed the food with no complaints. We where a little skeptical of the past reviews but by far exceeded everyones expectations. Sadie and all the lady servers are amazing. Will definitely be back for the amazing service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2,1.72,1.8,1.872,,1.7680000000000002
