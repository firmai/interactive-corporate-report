Taylor R.,"Sparks, NV",197,75,41,4.0,1/8/2018,"Their burgers are always cooked just the way that I ask for them to be. My favorite is the banzai burger. You wouldn't think a burger would pair well with teriyaki sauce, but it is delicious!  Their salads were amazing, and then they changed them (for some ridiculous reason), and now they are beginning to change them back. The Caesar salad has also made a return. Again, I'm not sure whose idea it was to change the salads, and get rid of one of their best ones, but it looks like they have fixed their mistakes.  Other items that are delicious and worth a try are their steak fries. They are 'bottomless', meaning they will continue to bring you out as many as you want. I think all of their sides may be bottomless, as well as the drinks! Our server was even kind enough to switch out what my friend wanted (she went back and forth between the light raspberry lemonade and diet coke). I think his name was either David, or Andrew. I wish I could remember because he was so friendly and quick to serve our table even though he had several other customers that day.  It had been a while since I had visited Red Robin (due to a gross salad and 'nearly' under-cooked chicken experience I had a few months back), but a friend of mine from Canada was in town and wanted to go. After our experience on Friday, I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2
Kristina K.,"Sparks, NV",73,135,154,5.0,12/4/2017,I have yet to have a bad experience here. Whether it is just my husband and I or the whole family we have a great time. They have a great selection of beers and a full bar. I usually get an IPA or a house margarita. My husband loves the burgers. And usually rotates through the different ones. I am a lover of fish and chips or salmon. They have an amazing cod sandwich. My youngest can have her moments of pickiness but they offer grilled cheese and I know that she will eat that. The sides are really kid friendly... she usually gets apple slices or french fries. We will be back for lunch or dinner again soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2
Tim R.,"Sparks, NV",3,57,,4.0,11/26/2017,"Dinner was great---the child that wanted this as her first post-braces meal was very happy.  I had the Smoke and Pepper burger and I was very happy.  Braces girl had the Double Tavern---She asked me to write she was in Heaven. She also said the fries are the best. Her brother had the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double. Or as I call it, the Death Burger.  He loved his insane food choice and the six glasses of water he needed just to get out of the restaurant. JK.  Seriously though, he did like the burger.  Wife had the Crispy Arctic Cod.  It's her staple here, she loves it and orders it every time (boring).  But it does say something for the sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2
Debra K.,"Sparks, NV",62,195,662,4.0,8/8/2017,"You know, for a chain burger joint, this place always delivers. They have a menu that has your favorite burgers, then they introduce every once and awhile a new burger. They have super thick milkshakes, and yummy bottomless steak fries.

Paul S.,"Reno, NV",1126,966,5334,4.0,7/16/2017,"July 15, 2017 Saturday - 12:45 PM for lunch 4 Adults Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Service - 4 stars Background - Time to get lunch before our shopping for the day. Atmosphere - Place screams chain, huge dining area divided into sections.  We were in the back cover.  Lots of televisions with baseball games on. Food   Drinks - Fresh Squeezed IPA by Deschutes.   Lunch - Siracha Tavern Double, their tavern burgers are smaller than their normal ones so it was a perfect for lunch.  I had to take four bites before I even had a hint of siracha.  A name like siracha I would expect some heat.  None was even present in the burger so that was disappointing.  The burger was still tasty and worth the money.  The sweet potato fries were good. Service - I expect when you change from regular fries to sweet potato and there is an extra fee the server would tell you there is an increase when they tell you about them. Future - Sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2
LaRena F.,"Sparks, NV",351,390,3165,2.0,5/19/2017,"I really dislike having to write a negative review.  This Red Robin is normally warm, friendly and inviting.  On this occasion it was none of those things. We arrived around 3:30 p.m. There were two other tables besides ours. We asked for a few minuets. Our waitress went to the back of the restaurant and was sitting with two workers who were eating and talking. I tried to get her attention. Once I got her attention she went to the other two tables before coming to ours. She seemed annoyed. We placed our order.  Our waitress dropped off our order. My hamburger smelled off and smelled bad. I managed to get my waitresses attention and she told me ""What your smelling is the Broiler"". No that is not what I am smelling. It was a burger I have gotten before. The meat smelled bad.  I asked her to send it back. She was annoyed but did so. When she brought it to the kitchen I could hear laughter and some of the workers were making fun of me. I then asked to speak to the manager. He was annoyed and proceeded to tell me that he knew bad meat as that was his business. He then added that he had personally made my burger. I don't know what that was suppose to mean. I told him that it was bad business to laugh and speak negatively about a customer where they could hear you. He said he would have a talk with them.  I got a new burger and it was fine. I ate the whole thing. But the manager and our waitress make me not want to go back for a really long time. I have never had this kind of treatment here before. Normally this is one of my favorite places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2
Phil R.,"Reno, NV",51,99,11,3.0,8/19/2017,This particular location has some things to work on.  Food quality and taste was so so.  Nothing special or memorable.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich with garlic fries.  The burger  was not bad and the garlic fries were sad.  They were just steak fries with all the garlic and cheese stuck to the bottom of the plate.  The server had some severe memory problems also. He couldn't remember anything with our orders or condiments.  Overall about a C- establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2
Benjamin J.,"Reno, NV",2,1,,5.0,12/31/2017,"Excellent gourmet burgers. Extensive menu for all things burger-related. If you're not hungry for burgers then you can order sandwiches, soups, salads, chicken, fish, etc. The alcohol menu complements the food quite nicely. To top it all off, you can order food for pickup online. In all, one of the top burger restaurants in the Reno area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2
Amy A.,"Sparks, NV",167,70,11,5.0,7/28/2017,"Every time my son and I come here for a nosh I always feel like a VIP.  I usually order the Bar Wings and Chips with the BBQ sauce. I know their burgers are also de-lish, but I prefer the wings. Occasionally order salad and soup. The chicken tortilla is the best.  Don't forget their entree menu. Salmon is usually a good choice.  If fish isn't your thing, go for skillet menu.  Service is always fab-lous and greeted with smiles. We are a reward customer. Its a quick easy sign up. Download the app to keep track of the rewards. You will give them your phone number before they bring the check so your rewards are signed in.  This location also offers orders to go. I think you call in the order.then a server will bring it out to your car.   Also if your just wanting a quick bite to eat, go with any of the yummy appetizers. chips and salsa is always a favorite. If you prefer a app with a twist, try the fried pickles.  You'll totally enjoy. Bottomless fries, some beverages, and kids menu is a great family and large group hang out.  Kids get balloons if you ask for it.  If your having a birthday, they will sing a happy song with dancing and clapping. Its a fun place for all ages.  If you have allergies, be sure to tell your server. They will provide a menu just for your allergen preferences.  They have a full bar with tv (usually sports baseball, football, soccer). Never a dull moment. Deserts are always a favorite.  Try the Fruffles with a berry dipping sauce.  Friday and Saturdays are the busiest with waitlist.  Parking lot can be sometimes crowded. Best to get there early.  Friday and Saturday open till 10pm. Other nights open till 9pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2

We ordered the onion rings with extra campfire sauce to share. I normally get the whisky river BBQ burger, but tonight I saw they had a 4 cheese melt sandwich and had to try it. With bacon of course! Definitely a good choice with bottomless steak fries. Hubby got the big ghost burger and demolished super fast!

Rhonda H.,"Reno, NV",5,42,29,4.0,11/4/2017,"Went here for lunch. Extensive menu with many options on burgers. Unlimited beefsteak fries that came with the meal. I have been to another Red Robin where you got the fries immediately upon being seated. We ordered the onion ring stack with 2 sauces that were amazing. I would highly recommend the onion rings. A table next to us got the spinach dip and that looked really good as well.  Service was a little slow but we did arrive right at lunch and it was pretty busy. You can check out right at the table when you're done, which would have been nice to know as we waited awhile for our server for the bill. Next time we will be prepared. Food was good and nice choice. Would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2

Mine was fine although the endless fries kinda ended without more.  Her cheeseburger came with all the stuff she asked for them not to have on it.

Fast service, make you feel like they are your friends, and they never skimp you on to go orders but usually throw in extra fries, so I throw in a bigger tip . I don't suggest their chicken sandwiches or salads as the chicken seems like prepackaged, microwaved..just odd texture even. The shakes are excellent.

We've gone to this location twice and have only had two issues (which aren't really ""issues""). The first would be that we felt the waiter was overly pushy about getting us to order dessert and the other was that we waited about 3-5 minutes for someone to come and see us/seat us. We did try to get someone's attention but I guess they were really busy. Nonetheless, overall review: good food and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2

Arrived early, just the 2 of us, had wanted to eat up front in the bar, but all the booths were taken, so we sat in a booth in the rear of the resturant. Bad choice, there was a table near us with 5 unruly children and only one adult with them, they were loud, screaming, and all over the place. Maybe awhile before we return to the Red Robin.

Susan A.,"Reno, NV",55,131,275,5.0,2/14/2016,"I know your probably wondering why I am giving a five star review on a place I have not checked in to. Well long story short my data on my phone ran out so I couldn't use it. However, I want to write a review.  I have not had service or experience like this in a long time. I have to give a huge thank you to Makenzie our waitress. Yes, your waitress or waiter makes a huge difference in your experience.  So it started out at nobody wanted to cook and we just happen to drive by and say lets eat there. We walked in and were seats very fast. Our waitress came over and offered us drinks right away and explain the machine on the table. The best part is how honest she was. She said if we want to order sooner we can use the machine because sometimes she can't get to us as fast! But it is understandable. Tons of clients and orders I get it. She seemed like she was happy to be there and was in a great mood and was nice!  Well, she was on top of it! Are drinks were constantly being refilled. I don't think I had my cup go half way down. Well then we ordered. I got a Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger with garlic fries. Well done, oh yeah and bottomless fries. When eating this burger, I was able to taste all of the flavors. I actually did not have a plain meal like I'm use to at other places. Maybe is was my lucky night!!! So the food was good, the service was good,now the environment. Is was clean and entertaining for my kiddo. The best part is then achieves they have in the table for putting in orders and oh yeah paying right there so you don't have to wait for a check(which I'll get to in s minute) they also have games for kids to play if they get restless. They do however charge you I believe $1.99. But handy for restless ones when trying to visit with friends and family! Ok so paying, on the screen it have all these options like a smartphone of what you want! Well when pushing paycheck it brings up your order. So we did and we were checking it out because it was our first time using something like this. Like o said our waitress was on top of customer service she ending up over by us asking if we get it and showed us how to use it! Seemed pretty simple! And the new was of paying for meals!  As for going back, yes definitely! Just so I can get that kind of service again and the enjoyment of the meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2?start=20

I'm giving red robins a two star rating only because the service team was great starting from the hostess, to the server, to the manager.  I did see food dying under the heat lamp for a while, while waiting for a table in the waiting area.  It SEEMED pretty busy, but I felt like there was an adequate amount of staff members.  Anyway... My BIGGEST complaint was the food! I ordered an appetizer: the spinach artichoke dip. The dip was cold in some spots then barely warm in others. The chips were GREASY.  My boys ordered pizza and mini corn dogs. My oldest normally loves corn dogs, but he just picked out the hot dogs and left the outer part on his plate.  I ordered what I thought was one of their ""tavern"" burgers. I was expecting to be wowed with all of the bacon talk, but was let down. I'd have to say Ive probably had a better burger at McDonald's. It tasted burnt and man oh man was everything greasy. There was actually a pool of grease under my burger. Normally I love garlic fries and loved the concept of bottomless fries, but I didn't even finish my initial order.  I'd have to say, that I most likely would not return.

For the service - it was rotten.  When the tower of onion rings came, it is customary to also bring small plates so everyone can put their serving on it, right?  No plates, had to flag someone down to get them.  Then, no silverware or napkins on the table, waitress nowhere in sight, so I went and found some myself.  We had to flag someone else down for drink refills.  I had to go find the sugar (for the coffee) myself as well.  Finally at the end of the meal we needed a to-go box and of course, our waitress was nowhere, so I went and found the box myself.  Heck, I should have tipped myself too because I was doing all the work.   It's clear that the staff needs to be properly trained, so management needs to step up and see to it that waitresses actually know what they are doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2?start=20

Boyd Z.,"Sun Valley, NV",1,7,,1.0,6/19/2017,"I very rarely go out of my way to write a review if the review is not stellar.  But here we go.  Last night, fathers day dinner, I chose Red Robin because I do like their food.  I arrived about 7pm with my wife 15 mins behind me.  I was seated immediately.  I had no one greet me, ask about appetizers or drinks for a bit over 10 mins.  There were plenty of staff.  They just walked by me.  I got their wireless device and hit ""call server"" and in about 3 or 4 minutes one finally came by.  I get it, things happen, everyone is entitled to a prob or two.  I ordered boneless wings and ice tea for wife and I, who had just arrived.  Ice tea in about 10 minutes (no water or anything yet), and appetizer in another 10 or so.  Now, I do not have great expectations, but come on.  Anyhow, boneless wings were dropped by someone else, and I do mean dropped.  They were only half coated in BBQ and therefore dry.  If I wanted crappy chicken, KFC is right around the corner.  Anyhow...  I was starved, ate them anyway.  I tried multiple times to flag down server for refill of my tea, and finally wife yelled out :""HEY"" to get anyone's attention.  Refill arrived after our meal by another 10 or so minutes.  Our waitress said she was frazzled.  Me too.  I had the sombrero smokey bbq salad.  One small thing of dressing, and the chicken was still pink (somewhat raw) on the inside.  We finished what we could and left.  Like I said, I rarely post bad stuff, but this was so bad, I didn't feel like filling out the survey on the spot.  F this. It killed my fathers day dinner.  I don't expect the world but one sign of good service is making sure that our drinks are filled; FAIL.  Appetizer good: NOPE, FAIL .  Meal good, not cooked thoroughly; FAIL.  I have many choices on where to go.  I sincerely doubt I will return to this establishment.  Expectations ; a ""C"" to ""B"", reality ""F"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2?start=40

I ordered a draft beer, kids had sodas and wife went with a mixed   took about 15 mins to get our drinks, place wasnt that busy or id understand.they didnt have menues on the tables yet, so the server went and grabbed some. Whats this? They're in spanish? We asked the server for menues in english, crazy idea right? Here in America and all..... the server replied with, ""we are all out of english menues but if you need help, i can translate""..... is that a joke? After our drinks showed up, the server started taking orders, i figured with the amount of time it took to get a draft beer, id order the chips and salsa with guac for an appetizer with the thought itd take forever to get our meals. Buzzzzzzzzz wrong. 45 mins later all the food came out, you guessed it, with the appetizer. So, to recap, on a 14 top with a moderate to slow night, a Saturday night, it took forever to get simple drinks, an appetizer before the entrees, and they had zero english menues....... 2 stars, the beer was cold and the food was good. No english menues!!!!! What the FUCK is going on with society that having zero english menues is acceptable? Its bad enough you have to press 2 for english, now this?!?!? I mentioned it to the girls at the front, with the manager standing behind them, and they laughed, fucking laughed. I will NEVER dine or order take out from a RED ROBIN again. Never.

Stephanie P.,"Sparks, NV",227,212,649,5.0,1/31/2015,"I HIGHLY recommend this particular Red Robin in Spanish Springs. Their food is amazing! But even more important to me is the fact that they are totally on top of gluten issues and take all of the steps to insure that I can safely eat there. Be sure to tell your server that you have a gluten allergy, if you do. If you are eating gluten free just for health reasons, you will enjoy the flavor of their buns and all, but you do not have to go through as many precautions and can let them know, too. But if you have an intolerance, Celiac, or something similar.... this is a great place to eat locally. If you don't know if something has gluten, there usually are a couple of people (including at least one manager) who are rather knowledgeable (at least when I have needed to ask a question). When your order is ready, a manager will bring out your meal and it will be in a yellow basket (instead of the red). If there is ANY question, they remake whatever it is. I have never questioned it there, but several times (I go there all the time) a manager has brought me part of my food and apologized for the delay on the other part (usually the fries), because they could not personally guarantee there was no cross-contamination (etc) of my particular item so they are having them remade to make sure. I am definitely OK with that. I would much rather start on part of my food and have the other come just a bit later and eat without getting sick.

The hamburgers we ordered were poorer quality beef than they used to be and did not taste very good for a $10 hamburger.  The steak fries served were about half the quantity compared to previously.  Good news : the server did ask if we wanted ranch dressing for our fries and brought us 2 servings. He also asked us if we wanted water and brought them promptly. The last time we ate here our server said the current franchiser was getting out of the business and Red Robin corporate was taking over the restaurant soon.  I don't know if this explains the poor service and poor quality of the hamburgers.

Appetizer came a bit cooler than normal bit it was ok since they were onion rings.  My drink was a gingerbread jack and ginger ale type of drink but my daughters didn't come.  About 5 minutes later sever came by and asked how things were And noticed we didn't get the other drink we ordered. About 10 minutes later her hard root beer and ice cream float arrived and my daughter poured it herself.  I was the only one to order an entrée which was a bonsai burger with fries.  I waited and waited and waited.  The server came by several times saying they were running behind in the kitchen but my food would be out soon.  A table of 6 or 7 came in to the booth next to us and ordered food and 10 minutes later they all got their food including the lady closest to me who ordered exactly what i ordered:  a bonsai burger and fries!  After 45 minutes of waiting i flagged the server again and said i  could not wait anymore.  I asked for the burger to be removed from the bill so i could simply pay for the rest.  She left a bit upset and shortly after someone came over (manager or another server?)  and asked how things were going.  I explained 45 minutes of waiting for a burger that never arrived only to see someone else served the sane meal i ordered long before they even arrived was unacceptable.  I again asked if they could simply remove the burger from bill so i  could pay it and leave.  She then told me that she was not going to charge me for anything and my food food would be ready in a few minutes.  She asked me to wait a fee more minutes for the food buy at that point i was so frustrated we just left.  I went to Sonic down the street and got a great burger in five minutes.  One of the reasons we used  to go to red robin was for the drinks which were not that great and slow this time.  Ironically we were here two weeks ago and had a different experience. I wish i could say it was an isolated experience but there were people behind us with a similar experience, a family in a booth who had to talk with the manager (i assume he had a striped shirt on.  I left with a bad taste in my mouth of bad service, and the food i came there for.  To be fair i probably could have stayed and got my burger bit i was afraid the cooks or server would sabotage my food for complaining.  Too bad as I will likely not return to this location anytime soon if ever.  I was generous and gave them one star since they comped the onion rings and two badly made drinks.   **Update** Went back to try them again and it was much better this time around.  Just for fun we ordered almost the same things again and it was better all around.  Server was friendly, food arrived quickly and was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2?start=60

Tiffany Y.,"East Bay, CA",1975,824,1108,4.0,1/1/2012,"This was my 1st time at a red robin chain and I liked it alot!!!   I ordered a patty melt and the mud pie.  The patty melt wasn't cooked as rare as I liked "" plenty of pink"" but the meat was still tender and juicy.   I don't like steak fries, and should have ordered the sweet potato fries instead. The sweet potato fries are DELICIOUS and definitely worth the extra .89 cents, and since its bottomless you could just order them over and over again to share with everyone.  The mud pie wasn't as big as I thought it would be about 7 inches high, with tons of whip cream everywhere.  It has a chocolate crust with cookies n cream ice cream, and then a huge layer of VERY chocolate ice cream.  The chocolate ice cream is really good, very chocolately I think most chocolate ice cream is never chocolatey enough but this was really strong and perfect flavor.   The plate had alot of fudge and caramel swirls all over it which made it even more delicious.  Our server was Amanda, she was kind of slow,  I think they are understaffed ( which seems to be the case  in most restaurants ) she was so sweet though!!! I really liked her and recommend anyone to ask for her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sparks-2?start=80

She did get back to us and asked what we would like to drink.  We told her and then asked her what tables are you waiting? She replied the ones on her left and also the whole bar eating area.  That they decided to do this recently and that she needed to earn a living.  Then instead of making our drinks, she started on the approx. 10 drink ticket orders for the waiters.  Then we told her we are going some place else and left.  I'm not sure, but I thought bartenders made a pretty decent salary?

The crispy chicken salad is good but it came on a much smaller plate with a piece of bread that was burnt.  There were a couple pieces of my chicken that made me question if they were cooked long enough.

Teresa B.,"Sparks, NV",1,4,,2.0,10/26/2013,"The reason for the low rating is because of the food and service. The food is so not worth the price on the menu and the burgers tend to taste bland and are only cooked well done and the seafood platter was gross!  The clam strips were over cooked and the cod pieces were nasty so that didn't get eaten. The fries have always been really dry, which made me thirsty, and lacked any kind of salt or seasoning. We only go once a year for our daughter's birthday dinner but after this last visit I doubt we'll be back. The service was terrible,  it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to get to our table (there was really no customers and I saw wait staff standing around because the lack of customers), we got our drinks pretty quick, we ordered and didn't see our waitress until after we got our food (she didn't even serve us!!), when she asked if we wanted anything to drink we said yes. I got my soda back and it tasted off, well basically she didn't remember what I had so she just chose a soda for me. Are you fricken kidding me!!! When she gave us the bill she was all nice and was trying to joke around with us (mainly my husband) and when I took the bill looked it over and used my card (he left his wallet) the look on her face was priceless! Anyhow food was terrible, service was terrible and so I left the bare minimum for a tip.

When it came out it was soaked in the oil the sun dried tomatoes are stored in. The fries were soaked as well. When the waitress came back to check on us I asked her if that was normal. She said she was going to take it to the manager. When the manager came over, she didn't offer any apology.  She asked if I wanted a new one, or because I had taken a bite of it she could bring me a new bun and I could put it on myself. She was short with me and acted annoyed. I asked if I could just have the new bun. She walked away without saying anything to me. She brought back my burger with a new bun on it already.

But Applebee's has a more extensive menu- Red Robin says they specialize in gourmet burgers. So in I go. I wanted a bacon cheeseburger but I wanted it blackened. The waitress didn't bat an eye, not a problem. The problem was my ""gourmet burger"" was a tiny little thing, especially considering the ten dollar price. the patty was so small as soon as it hits the grill it's cooked, so don't kid yourself asking for ""medium"" or ""rare."" Ain't gonna happen. There was really nothing special or ""gourmet"" about it. It definitely did not resemble the picture in the menu, but they never do, do they? There was very little ""blackened"" taste until the last couple of bites. The meat was fairly tasteless otherwise. Nothing else really stood out, which I thought was unusual for a place claiming to serve ""gourmet"" burgers. The lad had a BBQ burger, same problem. ""Where is the sauce?"" Looking closely. ""Oh, there it is."" The wife had fish tacos which she deemed plentiful and tasty. Plank fries. Hate 'em. They're no better here.

When they bring them, the lemonade no longer had one strawberry in it and hardly any red of the syrup. For the fries they bring two tiny little baskets with like a total of 8-10 fries each. (For a party of 7) they finished right away everyone got like 3-4 fries each, we ask for a refill and they take like 15 mins to bring us now just one tiny basket for everyone. It's not like they were busy because the girl taking care of us had one more table only. We also asked for ranch and they gave us three tiny cups for all of us. My tip would be they should stop offering bottomless whatever and just serve a good portion for the side that way customers don't need to be asking the waiter and getting upset for a 10 fry refill. Or actually serve a decent amount so no refills are required. Definitely wont be going back to this location.
