Tabatha R.,"Mesa, AZ",105,121,32,4.0,10/7/2017,"I like BJs because I like options... and boy does BJs have options. The menu is a mile long and they have a little bit of everything. Looking for pasta? Pizza? Chicken? Fish? A burger? They literally have everything.  I've tried quite a few things including their pastas and fish. Their mashed potatoes are really good and I also really enjoy their asparagus. My favorite thing at BJs, though, is actually their in house crafted cream soda. It's the perfect taste.  The salmon on their low calorie menu that comes with the rice pilaf is delicious and not over cooked, has a lot of flavor. I've also had the cherry glazed salmon which is equally as good. Their pizza cookies are really good too. And again. Options. A ton of them. They even have a churro Pizza cookie at the moment. Two perfectly yummy treats in one!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa
David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,3.0,11/17/2017,"Good enough. Their weekday specials are the draw for me. The quality is right at this price. But, I would not order the same items at full menu price. My fav is the Thursday night rib deal. Get the full rack. For the money, it's a better deal. And, it seems the serving size is always more than double the ""half rack"" size.  Clam chowder is done well. Tomato and mozzarella salad is very good. Skip the Caeser. Fries are cooked well done and salted to the point to motivate beer sales. Broccoli is hit or miss and can be unripe. I'll never order the asparagus again - wilted and the tips where brown. I commented several times to the server but she never picked up on it. Ribs are usually cooked well and the BBQ sauce is excellent. Sometimes the meat is overcooked and, with the sauce basted on, can be caramelized to rock hard. The Pizzookies are always wonderful. This place is a worthy venture. I've not tried their beers but I'll venture they do a good job. And, for a sports bar/restaurant, the place, though nearly always packed, is no noisier than most Valley eateries. Go, but do treat yourself to a Pizzookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa
CeCe E.,"San Francisco, CA",83,6,,2.0,8/10/2017,"Fantastic food but I have only had good service one of the many times I have visited. One time I  visited with my mother at 9pm and we waited to ve sat for 5 minutes. There was no server or employee in sight. We stepped in and looked around to ask someone for help but saw nobody, so we left.  Whenever I have gone with my friends we always have at least one mistake with our order. Every server except one has taken 15 minutes or more to refill our drinks. It has regularly taken 45min to an hour for our food when the restaurant is not busy. It is terrible terrible service. But 2 stars because the food, when correct, tastes amazing and that one server (Melody?) was fantastic.

Jason P.,"Chandler, AZ",7,19,13,1.0,12/18/2017,"I took several of my Co workers here for some appetizers and a few drinks, with 6 of us... all laughing and having a great time. We had a total tab of $150. Including $60 of appetizers.... we had been there 55 minutes and the manager, a very young and inexperienced guy decided that he should cut us off, simply because we were being loud in the bar area.   We were not intoxicated, we were laughing and making jokes.  Of all the times I have been to a restaurant, and or bar. This was by far the worst call ever made by a manager on duty.   Luckily we were very close to a place called RTO Sullivan's.  We went there and had a great time.  BJ's ....You had an epic failure on Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa
Lauren L.,"Gilbert, AZ",47,78,224,4.0,7/1/2017,"Ok so truth be told this is really a 3.5 star but I'm in a good mood. The food is ok, a nice meal, big portions, only a little over priced ( loads of coupons through the app) the atmosphere it's self is great high ceilings, loads of interesting things to look at, huge tvs, for the sports fans I love the lighting. And you get a free dessert in your birthday. The staff is attentive and quick. So why the 3.5 ...., such potential for amazing food, dig a little deeper guys, use the fact that you are a brewery, create some dishes around that. Right.

Teri D.,"Powell, OH",113,702,50,2.0,1/4/2017,"Normally when we go to BJ'S back in Ohio we enjoy both the food and the service but that didn't work out for us here.  Table of 7 versus one server who we had to wave at chase down to take our orders, refill our drinks and even get the check.  She apologized once for being suddenly inundated by folks coming in but that didn't improve our service.   Seriously! She asked if we wanted our empty soda glasses removed (no we had grown attached to them) and never removed the empty appetizer plate till the very end.   The food was good all around except it seemed the ahi tuna salads ordered were very stingy on the tuna but the lack of service just put a cloud over the dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa

We had the prime rib dip, usually our favorite dish ($15 each.) This time, the bread tasted old, the meat seemed like the leftover pieces at the end of the night (it was 5 PM) and the gravy was too salty to use. I'm not sure we'll be back. I am so disappointed.

The sitting arrangements were a tad bit uncomfortable as they sat us in the back which was a little tight, but the waiter made up for the discrepancies with his awesome service.  Food was amazing as always.

Sherry C.,"Mesa, AZ",24,66,108,5.0,10/15/2015,I love BJ's Restaurant and their many variety menu and beer list. They are alway shaking with the newest brew flavored developed in their chandler brewery.  Happy hour is extended till 7 pm most days I love the cherry chipotle salmon. I have had their salads and pizza as well. Their burgers are beyond amazing. They have shoestring fries that are sooooo good Finish off the meal with a poozkie-cookie in a skillet with ice cream.

Gina G.,"Gilbert, AZ",3,42,1,2.0,2/20/2017,"I really wanted to like this place.   Called ahead for party of 6 to be seated at 6:30.  We arrived are 6:15 and were seated at 7:30 to a 4 top table with 6 chairs.  They realized we didn't fit so ended up pulling 2 tables together. Finally we order,  one of our party is a pescetarian and asks for salmon, they are out if salmon.  She asks what  pescetarian friendly dishes  they offer and the waitress who was vegan recommended that shrimp dish.  So now all salads are delivered however we still have no flatware we asked two different people for silverware and it wasn't until our waitress came to the table to see how are salads were that she realized we couldnt eat therm.   Next comes the food.  The shrimp dish smells like chicken.   We ask them to check and found that the dish was made with chicken stock.  Our server cane to the table apologetic.   She asked if she could bring something else.  We asked for the stuffed mushrooms, the server  rushed it however they still did not get to the table until we were done with the rest of the meals. Check please...I find that we were charged for those mushrooms.  As far as the food goes the ribs were good everything else on the table was Applebee's quality. Beer was great of course.  This was my son's birthday dinner so I guess my disappointment was intensified.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=60

H J.,"Mesa, AZ",5,7,,4.0,10/7/2016,I like going to BJ's one for the atmosphere and two for the beer. They brew their own beer and occasionally have specialty/seasonal beers.

Can hardly go wrong with that, but turns out my Cheese Broccoli soup was basically Cheese Cheese soup...entirely so cheesy I had to switch it out. The tomato bisque was hardly better. I suggest they bring back chicken noodle soup that the server said they had once before and took off the menu. Friend had blue cheese turkey sandwich and french fries he said it was good; could taste every flavor and it was a nice portion size he could only eat half. Total of about 25.00.

April B.,"Chandler, AZ",10,20,2,1.0,8/3/2015,"This was my first time at this particular location. We usually go to the location in Chandler without any complaints. To start off my experience, I called ahead to see if I could make a reservation for 10 (a bunch of nurses who want to meet up after work, around 8pm when then dinner crowd would be dying down, I would think). I was on hold for 15 minutes while the hostess ""checked with her manager to see if the reservation was possible."" After 15 minutes of being on hold, I hung up and called back. She apologized that nobody ever picked up the phone and that their paging system is faulty. She then told me that the reservation at time I was requesting would not be possible because they were too busy. I told her to put us down for the earliest time possible which was about 30-45 minutes from my requested time, which we could work with, she also said the bar was first come first serve, so I figured we could grab a beer and appetizers in the bar while we wait for a table to open up.  When we arrived, I check In for our reservation and told them we would be in the bar waiting. it was pretty busy in the dining room but we were able to find some scattered spots at the bar and high tops. Our server in the bar seemed overwhelmed and had a bit of an attitude. Another part of our group at the bar also said the bartender had a bad attitude as well.  We had a round of drinks, paid for them, and then our table was ready. The other half of our group had ordered a pizza at the bar, not knowing when our table would be ready and asked if they could take it to our table in the dining room. They receive attitude from the bartender and ended up just eating it in the bar to reduce any problems this was supposedly causing. They could have paid for it and tipped the bartender, I don't really see what the big deal was. The staff had major attitude and we were just trying to wind down after long hard day working with really sick patients. We weren't sure how we were inconveniencing their work and didn't really understand.  Just bad customer service. Food way okay.

Ever regret ordering an appetizer because it fills you up so much you don't even want to eat the main course? Well it's definitely not a problem with BJs calamari, not much for 11 buckaroos. I had the pulled pork sandwich, it was good.  The highlight of the evening was our server. It took quite awhile to get our food but we didn't complain. The server took it upon himself to talk to his manager and we ended up with a free salted caramel pizzookie  (I don't know how to spell that). It was tasty!

This particular visit I had the Calimari and Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. The Calimari was delicious, came both in the round and typical squid pieces, and was accompanied with marinara and a creamy, white dipping sauce.  The tacos tasted just like a typical chicken pita and came with a side of quinoa mixed with rice. The waiter suggested cholula hot sauce which definitely kicked the tacos up a knotch.

If it looks terrible, a wilted salad, well done when you ask for medium rare, not coming back to ask how it is, no refills on iced-tea, Nada. But have an expensive drink and then they hover.  The seating is ridiculous,  empty tables and they tell you they can't seat you for no wait staff for the tables in that section. We always took over tables until other wait staff arrived.

I did love the ambiance with the circular booths and brick walls. The service was quick and the server was friendly and attentive. The only real downfall was the price. It was $40 for happy hour which, considering the neighborhood, there are cheaper options that are just as good.

Warren E.,"Mesa, AZ",80,16,24,4.0,4/17/2016,"BJ's is a nice restaurant. If anything, this reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory but not as dark. We came here for dinner and to my surprise, they make their own beer! So this is a two parter. One for food, one for the beer. They have a huge menu. They will have something for everyone. Reason it's only 4 stars is we did have to wait for our waiter longer than normal on several occasions. Also this place wasn't packed. Busy but not packed. Bonus points for they give out little pizza pieces to the guests that are waiting to be seated. Food- starter was the potato skins. Would have preferred they weren't deep fried vs baked. They were tasty and they could have always used more bacon!! Wife had a bacon cheeseburger. Huge burger that's plenty juicy with all the fixings. I had the ribeye with a baked potato and a bowl of clam chowder. Chowder and the potato were very good. No complaints. The ribeye was cooked to my liking (mid rare) but the seasoning was missing. Felt like it was missing a bump from being a really good steak. I will probably get a burger next time I'm here.  Beer- I got a flight of beers. Cost about $7 for 4 of them. This time they are 5oz beers vs the normal 2oz. I got the... Lightswitch Lager- there version of the bud light. But this one is very good, crisp, highly carbonated and clear. Excellent! Harvest Hefeweizen- another great quality beer. Smooth, clean, went down way too easy. Would get a pint of this any day. Jeremiah Red- surprise of the night! Malty and sweet. Has just amount of kick on the taste buds to wanting more. Well made quality beer. PM Porter- I'm a sucker for porters and this didn't disappoint. Smooth, fragrant, great mouth feel. Well made Porter. This place knows their beers. Period. Can't wait to return and try the other craft brews on the menu.

S.Ellen B.,"Mesa, AZ",13,50,44,2.0,6/19/2016,"Horrible eating experience. Our server didn't care. The place wasn't crowded, but our server acted overworked and it took us ages to get drinks. After we got drinks, it took even longer before she came back to take our orders. We sat with our empty drinks, waiting to order and waiting for refills for an absurd amount of time. Our server didn't resurface until we asked another nearby server for refills - this lady seemed to be able to handle her six tales just fine, but our server couldn't handle two. Finally we got our orders in and she asks if we want refills. Are you kidding me? Of course we do - its just diet soda! Drinks were brought to us while nearby tables were being bussed - as in, dirty plates were put on pause, our glasses fetched, then the bussing resumed. We finally noticed there was a party of some kind with the servers and buss-boys in the other section of the restaurant. We watched as our server sat with friends and ate for a bit while we waited for our food and, again, went without refills. Bussers sat dirty plates on clean tables, next to the clean glasses and whatnot, which was totally inappropriate. When we did get refills, our server never took any glasses away, so our take got really crowded... especially when the food finally came. I very nearly started sitting glasses on the clean table next to us, because hey, thats what the bussers did. Our orders were wrong, but our server never came back to ask how our food was. My sister's burger was not cooked to order, all my sides were incorrect, and we were starving. My sis sent hers back (took another twenty minutes to get it corrected). I didn't bother asking about my sides, because I knew I might never see any food at all if I sent it back to the kitchen. I'm surprised my sister did. We begged another refill off another server and didn't see our server again until she dropped off the check.  The only reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because our server did take my sister's meal off the check since it had been incorrect. Unfortunately.... I have a feeling she did it not because the meal had been wrong, but because she suddenly realized with her terrible service, we wouldn't be tipping.  Overall, horrible service. Food was only mediocre, but to be fair to the chefs in the back, we might have been tainted by the bad experience.

Tonya W.,"Mesa, AZ",24,27,3,3.0,9/11/2015,"This was our first time at this chain & we were pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere & the menu selection. We were happy with the flavor of the hand crafted cream soda & impressed that it was served in chilled mugs (like A&W used to do before all the ones near us went out of business). We arrived for lunch around 2pm on a Friday afternoon & it was not too busy but also not empty.  We noticed the prices were surprisingly less expensive than Applebee's (all you can eat soup & salad for $7.95 compared to Applebees which is $9.99 & we had a bad experience at the Gilbert & Baseline location recently & don't plan on returning there) so that was a good sign. As an appetizer we ordered the queso & white corn chips. There was a choice between chili & pork, we chose chili to compare it with Chili's. We enjoyed it more than any other queso we have tried (& we have tried a lot) the problem was there weren't enough chips & I didn't detect a hint of salt on the chips at all. Since there weren't enough chips & no one came to check on us we didn't get to finish the queso as we would have liked because it was good & we were hungry. For lunch my daughters shared: Deep Dish Ravioli (Creamy cheese‑filled ravioli, Italian sausage and pepperoni, layered with BJ's signature five cheese blend, Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. Topped with fresh chopped basil.) which also was served with a garlic knot. When the waitress heard they were sharing she asked if they would like an extra one but they don't eat much so we declined. The waitress was thoughtful enough to bring an extra plate as well. My husband ordered rootbeer wings which were served with celery & ranch. I ordered the BJ's Barbeque Lunch Platter (A pulled pork slider and a Jallelujah‑spiced chicken breast, crispy‑thin or wedge‑cut seasoned fries, BJ's signature coleslaw garnish and BJ's Jeremiah Red® Ale BBQ sauce.) The chicken was well cooked & moist but was served on top of the fries which made them a bit soggy. For $7.95 I thought it was a good price for that much food. We then ordered a salted caramel pizookie with 4 spoons. We waited quite a while for the dessert to be delivered & in that time we had dirty dishes piled on the table in front of us which no one came to remove. Finally my husband took it upon himself to move them to a nearby table AFTER the dessert was served to us & we were having trouble reaching it in the center of the table because of the other plates littering the table (which should have been removed long ago, or at least by the person who served the dessert). Our bill came to $61 which includes 3 entrees, appetizer & dessert plus 4 hand crafted sodas which I find very reasonable. We also signed up for the Rewards Club but I don't much about it yet other than you get 1 point for each dollar you spend.  We definitely plan on going back to try out more menu items & we are hoping the service will be more prompt the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=100
Heidi S.,"Gilbert, AZ",13,39,83,3.0,7/10/2015,"We like BJs handcrafted root beer & cream sodas!! Free refills and they're served in a mug - like a hand crafted beer. They're sweet and smooth. Delicious! The black cherry is less sweet than the others. The orange cream tastes the orange dreamsicles from my childhood. The cream soda and root beer are tasty too!  I ordered the dinner portion quinoa salmon dish. The quinoa was good, and there was a TON of it. Way too much to finish. The salmon was a little too salty for my liking. I ate it because I was hungry & hate to see salmon (or any protein) go to waste. The mushrooms and asparagus were good in the mix, also. More of those and less of the peppers & tomatoes will be my request if I try this dish again. My husband ordered a salad and the 5 Meat pizza. (Yeah, he's funny.) He thought the salad was overpriced for what is given. (He's in the restaurant business, so knows food costs, etc.). And he was not impressed with the pizza. It was okay.  We both enjoyed the chocolate chip pizooki. A softly baked, still warm cookie with ice cream on top...is hard not to like!! We had not been to BJs in a while, and now we remember why. It's okay, and the tab with tip was $60. We both want the quality & taste (for that price) to be a little more impressive.  The service was great! Our server was friendly, helpful and attentive despite having many tables & guests. Our wait time was 10-15 minutes at dinner time on a Thursday, so not bad at all.

A few minutes later the manager came to us and said it would be at least 1 hour 45 minutes if we all wanted to sit together.  Understanding it was a busy Sunday we said ok but walked over to BJs to see if they would have a table sooner.  The hostess immediately called the manager up to see how long it would be since they had just sat 2 large parties.  The manager was very pleasant and genuinely wanted to find us a place, not at all like Red Robin's manager. She quoted us a wait time of 1 hour but said she would try to get us seated sooner.  We were seated 30 minutes later- all together.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  This will be our new spot for large family dinners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=100

Amy D.,"Phoenix, AZ",1370,357,15,1.0,2/13/2014,"For my birthday every year, my parents come down from Payson to take me to lunch. We try to coordinate where to meet, and since I have a client in Gilbert, my boyfriend suggested this. Oh, and they wanted to go to Winco right after, so this seemed like a good spot. I had never in my life heard of the place. Sometimes, that's a good thing. Today, though, it wasn't. Turns out, it's just a huge room with an even bigger menu. I chose the Cobb salad.  Now, let me make one thing clear: If I am going to have a salad, I always get a Cobb salad. The Vig Uptown has my favorite one. I *know* a Cobb salad. The menu said it came with feta. F. E. T. A. on a Cobb salad. I asked the waitress to substitute the feta for blue cheese, remove the bacon (I knew it wouldn't be real bacon, and I hate bacon bits), and keep the dressing on the side. It also came with ""turkey."" Never in my life have I sent anything back to a kitchen. Ever. But there was no way I was going to let this pass. I've seen enough Kitchen Nightmares to know that Gordon would have told the server to have the chef eat that salad, just to see how horrible their food was. And that's exactly what I told her. The ""turkey"" were a bunch of cubes of white stuff on my plate, that had obviously been frozen, and had as much flavor as the iceberg lettuce. There were chopped tomatoes all over the place, and my ""cucumber"" was a tiny slice off the end of the cucumber. (see photo) She offered to bring me something else, and I declined. I didn't even want the free *$&#*$&# pizookie, that's how angry and disappointed I was. They took the ""Cobb salad"" off our bill, and we went on our merry way.  My stomach was rumbling on my way home. I fear it's going to be a looooooooooong night. From a salad. The worst salad in all the land. I will never, ever eat at any location of this hole again. I had no idea it was a chain, or I would have picked something else. I've never cried during a birthday lunch with my parents, but I was mighty close today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=100

I also like the minestrone soup (a tad on the salty side though) and their wedge salad is really good -- also pretty decadent, drenched in blue cheese and dressing.  They make their own root beer which is amazing!   For dessert, you HAVE to go with the Pizookie!  They expanded their flavor list so there are even more tempting choices.  If you're dining alone or feeling bad about all the fatty pizza you scarfed down, they have a smaller/personal size Pizookie AND if you can't decide on one flavor, you can do halfsies.  Pretty great!

We had the Carne Asada french fri appetizer concoction.  It was delicious and perfect for 2 people to share.  We also had the Chicken Tacos and the Puled pork Sammich  ( hahaha love you Matt ) with the wedge fries aka HUGE FRENCH FRIES.  Both delicious.  I decided to order the Top Shelf Margarita with and extra shot on the side, due to the general weakness of the Margaritas made now a days.  Well... the margarita was really bad. I could BARLEY taste the Tequila!  I happened to see the manager  ""DAVID"" who had stopped by and introduced himself earlier. I expressed my concern and he personally went and made me a new margarita. I personally think that the recipe for this particular margarita is being served in too big of a glass and the measurements are out of whack. Top Shelf means Premium liquors, EXPENSIVE.  I think the drink was around $10.  For $10 I better taste more than sour mix in the margarita.  It was disappointing but expected to a point because of my habit of ordering a shot on the side to throw in it.  This particular recipe NEEDS to be RE CREATED.  After David re made the Top Shelf Margarita it was still too sweet I barley could taste the tequila ( hence the shot on the side ). So really I spent around $18 on a margarita ( quite ridiculous ). I was however very impressed with David's customer service and impeccable personality and ability to makes us smile and have a great time.  David also helped us figure out dessert to take home.  Let me let you in on a secret.... shhhhhhhhhh.....  They will special make your cookie dessert!  We got 1/2  macadamia 1/2 salted carmel!  We were treated like gold not only by David but also Kim.  Kim was very patient with us and informative.  She made great suggestions and always had a smile on her face as well as a great attitude.  We were presented with the ""BJ's Premier Rewards Loyalty Program"" by David when we were wrapping up the meal.  I signed up and we will be returning.  There are ALOT of things to try on this menu and they have TONS of good beer on tap and in the bottle.  If you like Micro Brews and strong, weird beer that you can't get just anywhere, give BJ's a shot.  They've got a nice selection.   I give them a 5 star because of the way we were treated, the great time we had because of the treatment, the more than generous and friendly staff, the atmosphere was awesome ( Dim lighting and comfortable ) we were sat quickly in a booth as we requested and the food was delicious.  We walked out of there feeling like a million bucks and VERY WELCOMED BACK!   Thanks guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=120

Michelle H.,"Mesa, AZ",59,26,,1.0,7/21/2012,"I've been here on three different occasions. I usually enjoy in-house, micro-brew so that was the draw for me. However, I'd rate their beer better then an average tap bar but for a micro-brewery, it has pretty low points. In fact I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for the beer again.  This place is kinda a bar/restaurant, trying to appeal to beer drinkers and family diners at the same time.It's a large, high ceiling dining area that does not distinguish restaurant from bar.  The result is a large, noisy, brightly lit cavern that I found too busy and over-stimulating.  While there, my friend and I ordered drinks but we were coerced into a meal, mostly because the staff was constantly on us to order some food. On our last visit, the waiter asked us every 5 minutes if we wanted something to eat, no joke. When we finally ordered, he let up just until we finished our food. Then it was a constant interruption from him asking if we want anything else, sort of making us feel like we should not take up a table any longer if we're done eating. This was not one time, this is every time I've been there. Even sitting at the bar we got continually pestered into getting something more. The staff seems to be very high strung, sort of  like they drank 5 cups of coffee.  As for the food, I found it highly forgettable, in fact, I don't even remember what I ate.

My hubby noticed that his wedge fries were also overdone this time round. I took a few bites out of my burger and left all my wedge fries which are normally scarfed up first thing. I left a whole burger on my plate. I said WE WILL NEVER GO BACK. I do believe it is the way things are said to the cooks in the kitchen. They tork them off with some comment about the food. What should be done, is just put in another order. After the food is checked, THEN the comment can be made about the first order for this customer.

Amy S.,"Gilbert, AZ",210,214,47,5.0,1/14/2009,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants in the east valley (and I'm shocked to read the negative reviews done before mine). Over the last 2 years, I've probably been there for a few dozen visits with my biggest complaint being that they are extremely busy during your common weekend meal hours. The servers have always been more than attentive and will even offer free samples of their made-in-house microbrews if you seem unsure of your beer selection. Personally, I get excited each fall for their seasonal selection called ""nitwit""- it's a wheat beer, similar to a hef, with a hint of orange just gives it a unique coloring and taste.  They have many options for meals, with some of my favorites being their salads (very large size, I have yet to finish one), their baked potatoes (over a pound, then stuffed with your favorites), chicago-style stuffed pizza, and signaure sandwiches (the crispy chicken is my favorite, by far). And, of course, you can't pass up dessert at BJ's- they have pizzookies. For anyone who might not have already been introduced, a pizzookie is a big cookie (in a personal pizza sized pan), baked to be slightly gooey with a couple scoops of ice cream on top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=180

Wayne S.,"Mesa, AZ",13,9,,1.0,4/23/2016,"First of all, let me just say that my wife and I frequent this restaurant at least 4 to 5 times a week. We know all the managers all the waiters and waitresses except for one manager and of all of those we have a very good relationship with. We've always enjoyed the service and the food and on occasion we might have an order that's not right but no big deal. Tonight was different, I have never been so frustrated as I was tonight. I ordered an Asian salad which they are making it differently now than what they used to. The salad was so wilted I couldn't eat it and I finally just gave up. When the waiter came back to my table I never said anything and I never complained but my friends brought it up and told him that that the salad was so bad that I just couldn't eat it. So the waiter apologized and said that he would go talk to the manager because there was only like maybe one quarter of the salad that have been eaten. It was obvious that there was a problem with the salad. So the manager comes which by the way is one of the managers that I don't know personally, and he gives me this excuse that the reason why the salad looks like that is because the chicken is warm and it makes the salad look like that. But that wasn't the reason why. The chicken wasn't even warm when they brought it to my table for one thing. And then it was obvious that the salad was not wilted  because of the chicken, it was wilted because it was just bad salad. So he apologizes and then he leaves. So my waiter comes back to the table and asked me if the manager had come to the table and asked me if the manager had  spoken to me and I said yes. And he asked me what  he said and I told him that nothing was ever mentioned about not charging me for the food. So he leaves to go find out what he is supposed to do and he is told by the manager that he explained it to me and that was good enough. The waiter felt really bad and was put in a bad position because he knows that we come in there all the time and I could tell that he felt very awkward. So on  the way out I have a few Choice words to say to the manager and he looks at me and says ""What! I was going to give you your money back"" . But that's not the way it was at all. He had a chance and he didn't do it and then all of a sudden he's trying to make it look like he had every intention to give me my money back. Needless to say I was pretty ticked. We have never been treated like that before at that restaurant And let me just say that our waiter was great.   We could tell that he felt bad about the situation and he even offered to pay for desert but I declined.   It was not his fault.

Daniel V.,"Mesa, AZ",1,29,,4.0,6/20/2014,"Okay finally a review.  Typically I am in this place once a week, why? For me two reasons.  Food quality & beer selection.  In the past few months they have paired back the menu thank god it was like the Cheesecake Factory way to many choices.  They have healthy choices for us actually looking for smaller portions and the ability to substitute vegetables for starches without an up-charge or making you fell guilty because they may have to write something down. Unlike other places in the area they have there own craft beers, but actually carry selections that would compete with there own so as consumers we have excellent choices here.  I personally like the Parana Pale Ale which is there own.   My wife and I sit in the bar area so are adopted (not really she's a Gator Fan... Roll Tide) daughter can wait on us.  Rebecca is by far the best ambassador for BJ's.  While she pretty much runs the bar (never stops) she also takes the time to greet each and everyone who sits at the bar, answers any questions and makes you feel like you are her only customer. While in the background you can see the drink orders pile up.  So if you are in East Mesa and are looking for reasonable priced food, and a great beer selection, go in Wednesday - Saturday sit at the bar, yell out loud ""Roll Tide"" and the bartender who turns and gives you a dirty look is the one you want to wait on you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=160

Alicia B.,"Boulder, CO",332,501,97,3.0,2/10/2009,"My brother taught me a very valuable lesson. When you don't want to take the left overs home with you but you don't want to be rude, ask for a box and then ""forget"" the box on the table. There's a chance they'll run after you; there's a chance you'll escape free of leftovers. Thankfully, I escaped.  What did I leave behind? Their meatloaf. It wasn't the actual meatloaf that was gross. It was the gross sauce they drowned it in. Seriously, it was nasty. I ate one piece of the loaf and gave up, my stomach grouchy from the determined attempt to eat.  The veggies were great, as were their mashed potatoes. But the main course, the meat and its loaf, were not. Too bad, for that's what I wanted to like so badly. What I did like was their nut brown beer. It's the only one I can tell that's worth ordering. Don't bother with their porter. Ick.  BJ's could be a cool place to watch a game, if you don't get distracted by all the other TV's with different games on. I watched Superbowl highlights, a Suns game and a KU game all at the same time. This might've been overwhelming, if I were normal and didn't suffer from ADHD.

Andy G.,"Ithaca, NY",245,445,10,3.0,10/26/2009,"Hey, a restaurant that sells food and brews their own beer. What a novel concept! Not. BJ's is a chain and they do pretty good by their patrons. I can never go to a restaurant that serves fish and chips and not order it, so that's all I've ever had at BJ's. It pales in comparison to places that fry fresh fish, but it's passable. The beers are decent. Then again, so is Newcastle and Blue Moon and Bud that you can get on tap anywhere. The real opportunity for BJ's is to put together interesting pairings and make it a real brewhouse. They do have pairings suggested in their menu, but most of them fall flat. A blonde ale with fish and chips? No, sir. I don't care that you breaded the fish with the same ale. Do you think your average Brit would be caught dead drinking ""blonde ale"", with or without fish and chips? Hells no. Stouts and porters, man. It would be better if the waitstaff were a bit hip to the beers and could speak about them intelligently. As it is, they can regurgitate what's already written in the menu and that's about it. Most of them clearly have not even tried all the beers served there. That should be Day 1 of new hire training at BJ's. Get sloshed and take a cab home.  They need a sommelier, except for beer.

I've never had a real problem with the service, but with any chain it can be hit or miss.  Also, they are often very busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights, and you may experience slightly slower service due to the volume of patrons.  To avoid the wait time to be seated, you can call ahead and they will put your name on the seating list. The happy hour is excellent, 3-7 on weekdays, cheap-er appetizers that are all pretty solid, and discounted BJ's beer.  The only problem is that you have to sit in the bar area, which can fill up quickly. The take out service is very good, which is a plus since the restaurant can be so busy.  Little touches go a long way such as keeping warm food warm, not adding fries to the order until you arrive, and keeping the soup in a separate container from the bread bowl so you can combine them when you are ready to eat.  They also go over your entire order to ensure that it is exactly what you asked for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=220

Matt T.,"Mesa, AZ",19,64,5,4.0,8/1/2010,"We've been going to BJ's for years. Since the first on opened in AZ. This one just happens to be a little closer to where we live now so we go to this one more often than not. There is some good and some bad here. Good: The food is usually pretty solid. Havent really had anything here that I was unhappy with. The menu is huge so if you come with a med-large party, theres going to be something for everyone. They have a good selection of beer and a full bar. They have a great Raspberry Cider that my wife loves! The bar area is great for happy hour and a game. Bad: They call this a brewery...and it isnt. Its a restaurant that serves beer that the OTHER BJ's makes. This might not matter to you but it does to me. Weak! Because they're not an actual brewery, their liquor license is different and they cant fill the BJ's growler that I bought. Oh well, I'll use it to hold my change and I'll get my other growlers filled at real breweries. We've also experienced ""Dirty Lines"" here before. They should have their beer lines cleaned more often or more thoroughly or both.  Best part of the menu: Do not leave without having the Pizookie for dessert. It is one of the best things you can put in your mouth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200
Monica B.,"Arlington, VA",82,257,308,4.0,5/19/2011,"Overall this was a pleasant dining experience.  The staff was friendly and frequently checked on us to make sure we were taken care of.  The establishment is clean and had a very casual, relaxed feel. Our party of four were able to share a single large pizza, which tasted very good.  Although the meal was somewhat heavy, that's what you get when you order gormet pizza.  Okay, onto dessert: we ordered a Pizookie.  It's a cookie baked in a large dish with ice cream on top and it was delicious!  Eating here wasn't the healthiest choice but it sure was satisfying.  Would I eat here again?  Yes!  Will I go to the gym afterward?  Yes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200

Rose B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,,1.0,8/9/2015,"I'm only giving this 1 stars because of our excellent server Jeremy.  I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken salad.  It was the worst salad I ever had.  did not want to complain seeing my friend was buying me lunch.  the lettuce was soggy to the point that it was mushy and wet looking like a noodle.  I could hardly find any chicken on it and the taste was very bland.  and then I heard our server tell the next table that deep dish is Chicago style and I grew up in Chicago and trust me it is a very thin crust with ingredients covered in cheese and then cut in squares.  Deep dish did not catch on till the 70s.  so since BJ's says its Chicago style, they could learn a lesson on history of pizza there.  but all in all I am sooooo disappointed in my salad, that I had to stop for a burger a few hours later cause I only ate wilted lettuce for lunch.  yucky  It is making me wonder if I will ever return there again for any meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200

Brittany C.,"Tempe, AZ",0,9,,4.0,7/21/2013,My wife and I were searching for somewhere to have lunch on this side of the valley. We decided on BJs considering we had been there before and enjoyed our time. We were greeted by the rudest hostess I've ever come across. At first we were ignored. When she finally greeted us her back turned to us and she was talking over her shoulder at us. She then sat us. Our server was great!! She was very informative and gave us the perfect amount of time to look over the menu. The food was good too. We had the mini bruchetta for an app. My wife order the mahi mahi tacos and I ordered chicken tenders. The price was just right for the amount.  The reason this place did not get 5 stars was their rude hostess. Thankfully the service and good came through.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200

Just FYI, while you were busy yelling at an employee out front, my wife took down both of your license plates and turned them into Mesa, Gilbert and Chandler police departments for their BOLO (be on the lookout) listings.

Dan P.,"Phoenix, AZ",57,133,26,2.0,8/14/2010,"I had almost forgot I tried BJ's when I first moved to the valley some 8 years ago and was not impressed. Although the atmosphere was good the food just did not match. I did not return until yesterday when a coworkers birthday came up and so off to BJ's I go.  I was really hoping after all this time maybe I misjudged this place. I have to say that the service was excellent. Our waiter, although very busy on a Friday afternoon, was attentive and friendly. The first misstep was when I unwrapped my silverware and one of my forks had dried food stuck to it, gross. Oh well this can happen I guess so I order a chicken sandwich with a wedge salad and side of shoestring frys. The blue cheese dressing on my salad was runny and tasted sour. The sandwich was OK and my frys were cold.  So overall it was a fail, I guess I will give BJ's another 8 years and try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200

Courtney B.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,19,3,3.0,5/23/2014,"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. Got seated promptly, hostesses were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Our server was Aimee. She was personable. However, we got there just as her section seemed to be filling up. She started looking overwhelmed. I ordered a small deep dish, it came out as a mini. I was disappointed but tried to let it go. Then we started seeing less of her. Our drinks stayed empty, some random server came over and took our dessert order. I asked for chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla and she said sure, but when it came out it still had vanilla. I don't know what happened there but it was still annoying. She brought me a water out with dessert even though that's not what I had been drinking. She brought my boyfriend refills the entire dinner but always seemed to forget mine. I had to actually correct her and tell her I still wanted refills on the drink I payed for. It sucks that our experience was sacrificed because she was overloaded and being seated with multiple tables at a time. Food was yummy, people were nice, but smaller sections to focus on quality of service or a better way of pacing the seating is needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200
Brooke E.,"Gilbert, AZ",21,71,17,2.0,6/30/2012,"This review is based on JUST the Superstition Springs location: My favorite kind of pizza is from BJ's. My husband and I usually get half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken as toppings. Other than a Caesar salad and a pazookie, I have not tried anything else... so this review is based on just these foods alone. The pizza is extraordinary and just one slice will make you feel full! We tried the pazookie (ice cream with a cookie) a couple of times here, but I have had better elsewhere. Actually, their pazookie makes me a little sick. Their ice-cream tastes cheap and frothy.  Normally, I would give BJs a 4.5 star review, but because of my most recent experience at the Superstition Springs location, I am going to bring my starred review a couple notches. We invited some friends to BJs and advised them they could not go wrong with the pizza! My husband has a fatal allergic reaction to olives, so we always make sure to tell the waiter to NOT put olives on anything he eats. BJs has usually accommodated this request, and I appreciate that. However, I feel that our waitress at Superstition was largely incompetent. Well, I was correct! While we waited for our pizza (which took an hour-- it has never taken an hour, okay?) our water glasses remained empty (for an hour people!) The waitress never came to refill our glasses. We were annoyed by it, and even a little embarrassed that we had raved so much to our good friends we had invited about the restaurant. When our pizza finally came, there were OLIVES on the pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-mesa?start=200
Kyle H.,"Queen Creek, AZ",57,136,41,2.0,5/8/2010,"A little behind on my reviews....  Went here for lunch on 5/5/10. This was a lunch with family/friends.  We were there at about 11:30. Only a few other tables were occupied. We were seated pretty quickly. Then had to wait about 5-10 minutes before waitress showed up. Another 5 minutes to return with simple soda and lemonade orders.  Lunch orders included two salads, chicken tenders and fries, chicken sandwich and fries, angel hair pasta dish, and personal deep dish pizza.  Salads are a Little hard to screw up. Pizza was only warm. Some bites tasted like not yet cooked yet. Both orders with fries, the fries were cold as well as the pasta dish.  Of course, waitress never came back to check on our orders after a few minutes. So probably 10-15 minutes went by before she came visible to waiver her over. When we told her food was cold, she was clearly confused and unsure what to do. She said she would be back in a minute.  Manager too sounded confused and surprised... ""Don't know why food would be cold?"" He offered to bring out new order of fries, which he did fairly quickly.. No offer to discount meal ticket, no offer of free dessert, just apology and fresh basket of fries...  Would love to go back to this place to try the beer and maybe appetizers. Being a huge beer drinker, would love to try the different brews. The appetizer menu looked pretty good too.  I realize that any place can have a bad day. But first impressions are critical. Especially for food and restaurants.

Frank P.,"Mesa, AZ",39,20,4,1.0,3/7/2010,"Ahh BJ's... 6 months ago you were one of my favorites in the East Valley. Now, not so much. In fact, I may never go back.  Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed, usually the wait staff is competant, but the food was always great.  Good portions and quality ingredients, but not anymore.  Server was very mechanical and short. Since others bring the food, what else dies she have to do except check on us and keep our drinks filled? Sad. We ordered the Italian Market Salad which we usually split. It used to be a very finely chopped mountain of lettuce with great veggies, Garbanzo beans, cheese, meat etc. Now it has a small handful of white, droopy iceberg lettuce, tons of dressing and lots of white cheese balls. I could not finish my half (I was starving buy it was too gross) so we quickly paid and left.
