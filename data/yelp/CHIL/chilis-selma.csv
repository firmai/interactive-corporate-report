Rebecca R.,"San Antonio, TX",50,14,1,3.0,12/20/2017,"We have always loved coming to Chili's... over the years the quality of service has dwindled down. Tonight my son and I walked in and there was a line at the hostess stand. Looked like servers were hosting and serving. We were sat within 5 minutes, but sat at the table for another 5 before the server acknowledged us. Then another 5 before she came to get our drink order. My guess, she was swamped with tables. I was under the impression that it was going to be one of those nights where it's just all going to be bad. However, the server, Tina I believe, was very polite and took our food and drink order immediately. We were served hot and very very good food right away and she was very kind to check on us multiple times. She made our unexpected going out to eat dinner a nice one and we will go to bed full and happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Megan J.,"San Antonio, TX",7,62,53,4.0,9/23/2017,"There were a string of visits where the service was terrible. However I love the chicken enchilada soup and the margaritas so I keep coming back. The service has been average the last few times not as crappy as previous experiences. As long as they keep the margaritas, I'll keep coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Steph C.,"Sugar Land, TX",264,227,970,5.0,8/28/2016,"I always have a great experience at chili's. I come here often and the service is always good and my food as well. I usually order the chips and salsa, cheese bites, the Cajun chicken pasta with shrimp, the salmon, and the triple dipper. Those are my favorites! Today I came in and I had the triple dipper with southwestern egg rolls, burger bites, and boneless buffalo wings. For an appetizer I had the cheese bites and the chips and salsa with the skillet queso. Everything was delicious. I also had a platinum margarita which is always very tasty. I would recommend getting on the rewards program you earn lots of points to get free of your favorites! Thank you Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Jesse G.,"Converse, TX",0,22,4,5.0,8/6/2017,"Stopped in for dinner on a Friday night . Of course it was packed , people sitting outside and inside waiting for a table .

Worked perfectly !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Linda H.,"San Antonio, TX",13,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Worst service ever tonight.  Server took forever to check drink refills.  She then had wrong Kiosk on our table with a much higher bill and took 1/2 hour to correct the situation.  She could not figure out how to give us the dessert in My Rewards, and the manager took 20 minutes before saying she found a coupon we could use instead.  We left without dessert and will never go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Geneva H.,"Converse, TX",68,3,3,2.0,8/8/2017,"I sat at the bar when it wasn't too busy.  About 1:30pm.  It took a good 10 minutes before the bartender showed up to greet me. I ordered their happy hour apps and a water.  One modification to my Texas cheese fries, and they couldn't even get that correct.  Bartender kept disappearing.  I will try to come here again in hopes of a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Allison S.,"Houston, TX",0,15,,1.0,7/22/2017,"While I understand that this is a ""beginners"" restaurant job, I feel like the hostess today was just incompetent.  I walked up to the door with my cousin in a wheelchair where I could BARELY open the door by myself and the hostess couldn't be bothered AS SHE'S STARING AT ME THROUGH THE DOOR. My cousin is also pretty young and she didn't even think to give me a child's menu, just walked to the table without even asking.  Whatever, our waitress was amazing so I tried to forget about it...until it was time to leave.  Please help me understand why when it's so dead the hostess couldn't AGAIN open the door for me to get out with the wheelchair in hand and I had to get outside help to get us in.  Chilis please re-train your blonde hostess at the front. Absolutely no manners, and I'm sick of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Darwin C.,"Schertz, TX",4,7,,3.0,8/20/2016,My family and I went to Chili's for lunch after 5 yrs since our previous location did not have any in our area. It was a late lunch so e place was not busy at all. Our food took about 20 mins before it got to our table. By then my pasta tasted warm and the chicken seemed like it was frozen and cooked directly onto the grill. It was tasty but pasta served as luke warm is not as good.  Maybe it was just past the lunch hour rush or the cooks were slow or not enough cooks in the kitchen. Whatever it was the overall service and quality was average for me. My kids love to go to Chili's but we'll just have to try other places to make the comparison.  Hope this helps choosing which spot to go to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Alexandra S.,"Converse, TX",78,15,4,1.0,2/23/2017,"Terrible hosting done up front. I went with family to celebrate my husband swearing in to the Army yesterday and we waited over an hour and a half before I frankly had enough waiting. I spoke with the manager and she had nothing but excuses! She had no clue what was going on up at the hostess desk. People barely coming in were being seated before us, which I didn't feel was fair at all! Needles to say our night was ruined. My husband leaves in a week for 14wks and instead of last night being a good memory, it'll go down as one of the worst nights I've ever had. Thank you Chili's. I am never stepping a foot into any of your establishments again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Cullen H.,"Selma, TX",0,6,,2.0,5/13/2017,"Very unhappy with my experience today. Ordered a beer, was never offered a refill. Also, I believe the beer was the wrong size. Food was mediocre, at best. My ""crispy buffalo bleu"" came out with ranch instead of blue cheese. The waitress seemed very busy, and she didn't really want to help us. I'm sorry for the people that decide to eat here in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma
Jennifer S.,"San Antonio, TX",56,121,251,3.0,11/30/2015,"It's a great go to place for quick dinner. Sat at bar good happy hour prices.  Currently they have appetizer two full entrees, dessert and two presidente shakers for 35 dollars.  This saves you 5-10 dollars depending on happy hour times.  Molten chocolate cake is a must !!

Michelle H.,"San Antonio, TX",45,820,6542,1.0,7/15/2014,"Slowest, non-existent service. Restaurant was probably 2/3 empty.  The girl took our order then was no where to be found afterwards--not even when we needed a to-go box or to pay the tab.  I had to flag down the guy in a tie (manager?) and even he could care less that our server was no where to be found.  My mentioning of ""our server never came around"" didn't phase him one bit.  Of course, Chili's have the convenient mini machines on each table and so servers don't even have to come back to collect the check.   Got their Meal for 2 ($20): 1 appetizer, 2 entrees Margherita flatbread - pretty good 6 oz sirloin (not bad) with loaded mashed potatoes, sub Southwestern mac and cheese--creamy and pretty good Canjun chicken pasta - sweet and creamy. weird. wasn't a fan I normally like their southwestern egg rolls, mini sliders, and spinach artichoke dip. Overall, food was decent. Service from servers & management -- horrible. Poorly managed businesses never last.  Good luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma

Taylor G.,"San Antonio, TX",26,2,,1.0,4/2/2017,Chilis in the forum is awful. I happen to love Chilis but last Wednesday my family went there and it was the worst service I have ever had anywhere. We went in at 9pm with a party of 14 which i know is alot but we were willing to be patient. The host said it would be a bit before we were sat but then after 20 mins and about half the restaurant empty we started to ask if we could push some tables together to atleast be seated and the host said NO. We waited another 10 mins with nothing changing and were told we would have to sit in seperate tables since they were refusing to push tables together in an empty area. We agreed. We waited another 10 minutes and the manager rudly came out to tell us we were a large party and were inconveniencing them and if we wanted to stay we had to sit in seperate table which we told him we had agreed to 10 minutes ago. Finally after 45 minutes of waiting and rude service we were seated. Not only were we sat in 3 different tables they werent even close to eachother. We sat at tables for 10 minutes with no service and decided to leave. If i could give them zero stars i would. I will be going to different locations from now on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma

Steve B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,54,11,1.0,4/25/2016,"Well I'm a big chilis fan for years.  Even as their service and food flounders.  Today took the cake.  Enticed by a $10 you deserve it club member coupon if you spend $30 I went for dinner.  I ordered grilled chicken salad $8.79, chicken crisper $10.19, guacamole 4.99.  That all fell under 2 for 20.  Also got two margaritas.  So bill was over $40.  They refused coupon because they said 2/20 was special offer.  Look at online menu where does it say special and coupon does not say no 2/20.  The truth is a la carts they total $23.97 so add drinks I'm still ahead $6 a la cattle with coupon.  I have ate at chilis almost weekly since it existed.  If you treat customers like this I can see why you are half empty now.  I expect your staff to ensure I get good food and best deal.  I'm upset over $6.  I'll probably need a few months to forger.  Hope someone else fills my seat.  Poor marketing and management!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma?start=20
Judy R.,"San Antonio, TX",61,25,7,1.0,4/16/2016,"I try never to give bad reviews, if my experience is bad I give the benefit of the doubt and move on. But this was so negative I had to share. Went there early on a Friday night and , despite ample free seats in the restaurant , we were seated at a high top in the bar. We ordered our food and asked that everything come together since we were in a hurry. Our order was for bacon ranch quesadillas, loaded fries, a steak, and a bacon cheeseburger . We watched table after table come in after us and get here food, and in some cases leave , before out food came. When our food came out it was cold and the steak, ordered medium rare, was past med well. I don't have high standards from a steak at Chilis so wouldn't have been a deal breaker except for the way management handled it. The manager came over and asked how things were and I asked him if my steak looked med rare. He said it looked medium to him. I said ' based in the photos given on the menu it's well done'. He then tells me the pics on the menu are ""ridiculous"". Then you might not want to use them as a guide for how your valued customers should order?!?!?!  Then he proceeds to argue with me saying others got their food earlier because they ordered sandwiches. When I pointed out that one table had sliders and the other had chicken fried steaks he walked away and i never saw him again. The waiter then came over and pointed out that he gave us $3 off. Not about the money ..... It's about the customer experience!!!!! Could have easily been handled professionally and would have been forgotten by now .... Instead I wouldn't go back to this Chilis if I was starving and it was the only place in town. Full disclosure , I don't go to Chilis often, but have had nothing but great experiences with both locations off of 281.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma?start=20

Jan H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,17,,1.0,1/30/2016,"Went to this Chili's last night (Friday) and you can tell the place was staffed by either interns or rookies.  45 minute wait - ok, I get it, it's Friday night and lots of people were waiting.  We went in the bar to have a drink while we waited for our table.  Ordered long island ice teas for three of us.  All of the drinks tasted like lemonade (without any liquor), then my husband ordered a vodka martini (thinking how can they get that wrong?) and when the bar tender set it in front of him it looked like water from a dirty pond.  He swore he didn't put any olive juice in it.  It tasted as bad as it looked.  The second bartender replaced it with a new martini, she added a full jigger of vermouth (uhhh... we didn't ask for vermouth!).   That drink wasn't much better but my husband is a good sport and paid for it... although he didn't drink it.  While waiting for our table we noticed several tables in the bar empty for a long time, same thing in the dining area.  Lots of open tables!  Hello!?  LOTS of people waiting to be seated at those open tables.  The hostess (intern or sheer rookie) was walking around timidly asking people if they were the next names on the list... yes, I said ""walking around asking people""!  Hmmm... most restaurants either call out your name or have a PA system.  You could tell the bartenders and hostess staff were inept and after about 45 minutes we decided that the food servers appeared to be in the same class.  We left.  Won't go back to this Chili's ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma?start=20
Brad S.,"Wichita, KS",357,1386,637,5.0,9/12/2009,"I don't usually review chains; what you find at one location you'll find at another, and whatever you do find isn't usually very good. My visit to Chili's was no exception, but I did have some pretty good customer service that warrants noting.  It was a crowded night when our party of seven arrived, and the floor manager herself came out to work out seating arrangements when it was clear that the other large parties wouldn't be leaving anytime soon. We were more than willing to oblige some mildly-cramped seating for our meal, so we worked something out. I feel bad for the server whenever I eat in large parties, but our server Astin was on top of things, replacing the chips and salsa, quick turnaround on the drinks, and he even had separate checks printed and ready to go when it was time to leave.
