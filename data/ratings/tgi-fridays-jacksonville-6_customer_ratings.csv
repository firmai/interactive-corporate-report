32,Stuart G.,"Baltimore, MD",21,17,46.0,1.0,2013-10-14,"Now here's the thing. I use to frequently enjoy libations at this place. Two of my  favorite bartenders in all of JAX are here. So it's with some regret that I'll say, I'll NEVER go back.  Last Saturday, after a wedding and previous nibbles, figured hey, stop by, laugh with some friends, have a drink, cool.  Pull up to the place, ALL the lights outside are off. It's only like 12am, they close at 2am, what gives? Drive into the lot, see some employees on the patio, ask they are closed, ""nope."" Park, attempt to open main door, locked, WTF? Employee outside says, ""oh, she locked that one, go around to the other side."" WTF?  We walk around, get in, walk to the bar. All the bottles are capped off, I see one of my faves, ""hey what's up?!"" as I mozy upon a barstool. At which point I'm advised they are closing early. ""Why?"" I ask.  And almost on cue, the manager appears at the top of the bar with her arms folded with a look on her face as if, I, the paying customer, who normally runs large tabs and tips 30%+ is inconveniencing her.  I'm told that the opening person for Sunday was hurt, so she, the manager with the crossed arms looking at me and my guests sternly as if we are not getting the hint, wants to close up early, so the kitchen is closed etc., etc.  Essentially, to hell with the longtime faithful customer supporting your business, and your staff. She wants to go home and now, we must too. I looked at the manager, and very audibly said ""I guess the customer is never right or welcomed around here, I'll go where I'm welcomed"". Some patrons remaining in bar area finishing up, cheered me as we walked out.  So I look at the situation like this, if that manager would rather lose money than stay open til the scheduled time, turn customers away by turning off the signage, turning business away that you clearly need, you don't deserve my dollars or patronage again ...EVER!   The Ale House around the corner, greeted me with open arms, warm, friendly, attentive attitudes and a cold glass. To make matters worse, some of the patrons at the bar, that were shooed from Fridays, by that epically well mannered and trained manager (yeah, that's sarcasm), ended up at the Ale House showing me love at the bar.   Maybe, just maybe, that unpleasant, non-customer focused, person, will think about the impact of her actions. Because now, I will share this story with the next 11 people I meet, every day,  for the next year or so, or until I can stand face to face and have a folded arm stare-off with that manager. Guess I'll be telling 11 people a day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-6?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

52,Morgan H.,"Jacksonville, FL",51,337,830.0,3.0,2013-12-02,"My husband and I were looking for somewhere to grab a light dinner on Thanksgiving. We had been to lunch at the family's house but underestimated the fact that we would be hungry again later and neglected to take home any leftovers, so we spent a long time riding around looking for any place that would be open...TGI Fridays it was! There's nothing really special about the décor of this place just your standard franchise restaurant here, but the food was pretty good.  They have a tasting menu now where you can order 3 items for $16 or 5 items for $26 (I may be off on this price point but it's close) so we opted to do the 5 item one but we selected duplicates of 2 of the items...2 orders of the Ahi Tuna Crisps, 2 orders of the Thai Pork Tacos and 1 order of the Cornbeff Sliders.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good everything was. I would definitely order all 3 of those items again.

47,Athena C.,"Jacksonville, FL",423,179,788.0,3.0,2014-02-20,"Walked in on a whim to get some lunch. Today it will be free because I joined their stripes club a while back.  I was immediately encountered by the hostess and was seated at a booth. I'm alone, oh so lonely with no one to share this booth, but they weren't too busy. I could have sat at the bar, but I'm not a"" sit at the bar"" kinda girl if I'm going to eat. I sat back by the bar area and ordered a Long Island Iced tea ($3 Thursday on the 2fer drinks) and took a moment to peruse the menu.  I decided on the new Philly Cheese stackburger. And when the manager brought out the food (assumed it was him because of his grey TGIFridays shirt and slacks) he warned me that the plate was hot...  Let me just say, I was unimpressed by the presentation. Too much empty space on my plate... but it's Friday's. I should have ordered a different entree if I wanted presentation. The burger seemed eh, but it was very succulent and juicy. Medium well and empty gooey cheese and cremini mushrooms dabbled in it. This is one good sandwich. Given it might give me a heart attack but yummy. The fries were kind of cold which I don't like but I ate them anyway...  The burger was so good. I'm glad I didn't skimp on getting a burger party removed because it definitely filled me up and had me satisfied.  Overall, I come to this location because it is close to home, service is decent (won't say amazing, because my server was not overly friendly but maybe she read my cues of the fact I was in my phone and gave me space)and the drinks are strong enough for me at a decent price. I will continue to come back as long as I keep having positive experiences.  Thanks Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-6?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
46,T.J. G.,"Jacksonville, FL",34,11,108.0,4.0,2014-02-21,"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!!  I went last night and a new manager was there. He and our server, Ashley, know how to do customer service! Come enough to know they are there for us, but not too much to be annoying. Ashley refilled our drinks in perfect timing with us finishing our cups. She was happy, smiling, friendly....well you get the picture. So let's get to the meat of this review.  PROS: -Customer service done right! -Delicious Food! (Did you see my Dragon fire Salmon pic? Or appetizers?) -Open spaced atmosphere. Very Chill. -Open late (2am baby!!) -Drinks...you go...you'll see ;-) CONS: -Menu seems a little lack luster. 2 for $23 or 2 for $15 are good deals but how about two meals and not an appetizer and meal. Like 3 for $30 or something. I wouldn't compare it to Applebee's or Chilis b/c the food and ingredients are different.  -Seats aren't as comfortable as I'd like...just a little more cushion. Overall, that was a great experience! I saw the reviews and wasn't expecting things to be that good, but I'm a happy camper! I'm not sure if the new manager will be there often, but if he is the reason for the new change in service, then I hope he keeps up the good work.  I'm Tajuan and I thank YOU for reading this review!

31,Khristopher B.,"Jacksonville, FL",133,93,95.0,3.0,2014-04-14,"I have to say that in general I like TGI Friday's. But at this particular location, I've gone twice. The first time was a terrible experience, but the second time was ideal. In a February review, T.J. G. notes that this location is under new management. Perhaps that's the reason why I had great service during my most recent visit and an awful experience the first time. Now, away from the level of service, I can't find too much to complain about for TGI Friday's. The atmosphere, whether the place is packed or scarce, is always calm and the noise level allows me to speak to the person across the table. The interior isn't over classy and elegant and it's not a complete dive bar hole in the ground. It finds that happy middle and just is what it is. Onto the food, a tiny part of me feels like it takes my meals too long to come out. But when they finally arrive, I'm never dissatisfied. Somehow, they're able to feed me the perfect portion size where I'm not super stuffed and I'm not starving 45 minutes later. So, if the facts are true and this TGI Friday's is under new management, please give this location another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-6?start=40,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

But this time my fellow Yelpers you're getting your review. Our waitress was nice but inconsistent. We ordered the $10 3 choice of ribs and two sides, the appetizer with the trio and strawberry lemonade for the table. The ribs were succulent and juicy, definitely fall off the bone good, but the fries were just ok, at least the lemonade was good though. We only got one refill that was supposed to come right before our meal but we're assuming she was a bit spaced out because she passed our table a few times claiming she would get it to us but never did. The appetizer was great, the wings were perfect, the mozzarella sticks were nice and gooey and the pot stickers were perfect as well.

They can't keep a full staff for a reason! all the servers are miserable .. If you fellow yelpers understood the chaos these poor servers have to deal with in BOH with the cooks and management not giving two thoughts about it. Food is shit, again bc the cooks don't care. They are getting paid regardless, and no one makes them care.. So why should they? Right? The servers there are actually good servers, but when your cooks fight you on every little thing like getting a cup of ranch, what else can they do? Just know, the servers try here, and you shouldn't tip them horribly based on a long wait time alone, I can assure you 9 times out of 10, it isn't their fault and are doing their best. Again, the food just sucks even if this kitchen had decent workers. Steaks are low quality and full of fat, little actual meat, everything is pretty much dropped in oil or microwaved... Yeah... Just save your money lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-6?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.052,2.6

10,Joe K.,"Jacksonville, FL",67,216,70.0,3.0,2016-05-15,"We ate here on Saturday, not my choice. The service was average. The Bloody Mary was not a Bloody Mary. It was some kind of pinkish drink with a sweet syrup and nothing else but ice. The burger was so messy I had to eat it with a fork and knife, though it was tasty. The part that absolutely stunned me was when the server asked me how I'd like it cooked.   She asks, ""pink or well done?"". I said ""Neither actually. Can I get it medium well?"" This lady literally stood there as dumbfounded as I was and said ""That's real difficult to do, but Cody's working in the back so he can probably make that happen."" No joke. That is word for word of the conversation between us. My face was in total shock and I kept expecting her to say she was just kidding. She wasn't.  And the burger came out very well done, guess Cody wasn't able to make a medium well burger after all. She did warn me of the difficulty level, my bad. I found it all so ridiculous and laughed about it all the way home. No more for me. I can grill a burger to perfection at my house.

Keep in mind I could still see waitress on the inside passing me. Well I left never will I return to such ignorance.

53,Harvey S.,"Jacksonville, FL",16,1,,1.0,2016-10-08,"Went into this place the day after hurricane Mathew and not only did this place have a reduced menu which is completely understandable but they increased all their prices!!! Their chicken fingers were 13.50 and their steak was 29.00, these prices were way higher than their normal prices. I found it so despicable that this place would raise prises after a tragedy and with so many people without power or hot food. I tried reporting them for price gouging, unfortunately you are unable to report restaurants for this behavior. But in my opinion it was beyond evil and just shameful, I just could not believe they would take advantage and raise all their prices to ridiculous levels. Do yourself a favor and never visit this restaurant for this downright advantageous behavior. The hostess seemed so ashamed for this too when we walked in, she kept apologizing and told us how she was so sorry and and would completely understand if we left and that the menu was introduced but the manager and she did not agree with it at all. I just couldn't believe this behavior, I will never ever come back to this Friday's ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-6?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

22,Grant F.,"San Antonio, TX",224,9,6.0,1.0,2016-12-14,"Admittedly, the waiter appeared to be new. However, he tried. I had ribs, poorly cooked and painted with an overpowering sauce. I was served before my dining partner's meal appeared. Weird. The mac and cheese (chosen side substitute) looked disappointing, but was the best and tastiest item on the plate. The cole slaw was a great foil for the overpowering sauce and was crunchy and refreshing. My dining partner's chicken and balsamic pasta was rescued from the heat lamps, but was still tepid. Now when ribs are served, extra napkins are usually provided. I had to ask and received a few cocktail napkins. Again weird. No finger wipe (which is usually provided as a courtesy when ribs must be eaten with fingers instead of forks). TGIF might consider better training for a staff that seemed to be trying. Cooks might need a bit of training too.

My husband said it was a little late and she said, ""I know, I know."" I asked to have it taken off the bill and instead of saying sorry and putting it to go, she just took it and walked away. Long story short kind of mad I didn't get the stupid soup lol Also, it's not worth you money for the portion size.

Instead of waiting for our response, she walks past us and leaves. Huh? So we sit at the bar. Apparently they were short-staffed but that wasn't an issue; the problem is that aside from ma'am that left, NO ONE acknowledged us.

1,Kevin D.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,70,32.0,2.0,2017-07-17,"I haven't been to a Friday's in quite a while. I don't know exactly what happened to this chain but they seem to have really lost their way over the past 20 years. I remember when Applebees, Olive Garden and TGI Friday's dominated casual dining. Olive Garden has had its ups and downs but still holds it's own. Applebee's and Friday's and Chillis for that matter have really gone to pot.  This review is just Friday's, Atlantic Blvd location to be specific. I heard that they were offering a unlimited appetizer special and if there is anything that I actually really like at Friday's it's their fried green beans with cucumber wasabi dipping sauce. And that's where it started, the green beans are not included in the special. Why? I mean really, why? It's not a premium expensive product so why? In some corporate bean counters office I guess it made sense. So I made due with some other random appetizers. Honestly other than mozzarella sticks and some sort of chicken nuggets, I don't remember what I ordered. All of it was completely forgettable. It was a steady stream of who's who of frozen food service products for about an hour (I was determined to get my $10 worth) So in summary, if you are a quantity over quality type of eater- you may be completely satisfied. The service was prompt, and the staff was visible. The hostess was extremely pleasant and made a point of checking on us as did our waitress. Honestly they were really on point, much more so than I would have expected. The facility really needs an overhaul. The exterior of the building was redone not too long ago and looks modern but the inside, especially the bathrooms are really showing their age. The men's bathroom was really nasty. My feet were sliding out from underneath me slowly the whole time I was in there. The tiles, the hardware, just beat up and dirty. That's a big deal, my Dad always said- (check out the bathroom first) if it's bad, the kitchen is probably worse.  Summation- Very average food, and not cheap. Service was above average, facility below average. I personally wouldn't recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jacksonville-6,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
