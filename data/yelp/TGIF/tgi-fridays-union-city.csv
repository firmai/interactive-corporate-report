Joshua C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Worst Food Ever! French fries did not taste fresh, food tasted so stale.  & the worst part about it, is that it is OVER PRICED.  I would of been much more happy if I want to a Fast Food Restaurant & paid half the price for food that tasted fresher.

Cherisse T.,"Pleasanton, CA",177,34,4,1.0,12/12/2017,"Wow! What can I say? I used to come here a lot. I always enjoyed their Jack Daniels Flat Iron. Tonight I came here and hear they no longer carry the flat iron. Then I went to order a house salad and found out they no longer carry Thousand Island Dressing. When I received my JD Rib-eye, it was tasty and cooked to my satisfaction. The broccoli was brown and old and not appetizing at all.

Jerrand R.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",31,6,1,1.0,10/8/2017,"I was heading home, super hungry and decided to do the 7mile drive to come eat here, sat myself, and now it's been 28minutes and no one came up to my table, nobody, there are at least 8 servers working , on my side at least 4 and none of them had the idea to ask me if i want anything, the table I sat on had a tablet, pressed the button to call for service a red light on top of the tablet blinked for 10 minutes, again nothing. People walked by , looked at me, at my super dirty table, yes, no one came to clean the table from the last customer's... this is the worst service I ever seen at a restaurant, and I've been to a lot of them... Just ask a server if I could order, she said, let me get someone for you... hahaha  I'm super hungry and I think I won't be able to get any food here!!! Worst experience at a T.G.I.

Sheila C.,"Union City, CA",140,298,495,3.0,2/21/2016,"I've came here a bunch of times and service isn't all too great. They have their good and bad days. When I came with my sister, our food took a little over an hour to be served and we were starving. I was so upset by the slow service. I always get something from their Jack Daniel's menu 'cause I love the taste of the sauce. If you haven't tried it, you should! It's a bit pricey and sometimes their steak isn't all that great but it's worth a try. It comes with 2 sides!  Some other times I would get the baby back ribs (half rack) if I'm feeling not too hungry. It's not too heavy for me and the meat is so soft. I think I actually prefer the baby back ribs than the Jack Daniel's steak and shrimp (it really depends on whether or not the steak is cooked good).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=40

Tina S.,"Redwood City, CA",163,199,,3.0,12/22/2016,"I went here with a friend and I ordered a plate (I forgot the name) that had shrimp, chicken, and mashed potato. It was mediocre. The shrimp was a bit dry on the inside.  This place is expensive in my opinion. Especially for the food you get, which can sometimes be really good and sometimes not that great.  Again, my experience was mediocre.

May A.,"Hayward, CA",266,138,663,4.0,3/11/2017,"Visited here with my sister a few nights ago and sat at the bar which was open seating. Our server greeted us about 5 or 10 minutes after we checked the menu. We both ordered bar drinks, a Peach sangria (recommend if you like something fruity but not too sweet) and a Moscow mule. I also ordered the bourbon barrel chicken which was very delectable! Came with 2 scoops of mashed potatoes and a bed of broccoli. Had a pleasant experience compared to the last time I visited TGIF which was about 3 years ago. Service was a bit slow but the waiters dropped by a few times to check on us so I was thankful for that.

Lincy H.,"Union City, CA",1463,550,932,4.0,10/23/2015,"Endless appetizers for the win! I came with a group of 7 people on a Friday evening (TGIF!!!) around 6:45pm. Any later, we would have definitely had to wait for seats. This place fills up quickly! We asked for the endless app menu. For $10, you can pick one appetizer and refill that same one as many times as you want. For $12, you pick an appetizer, and then refill with appetizers of your choice. If you go in a big group like I did, you can do multiple $10 options and share with your friends. What a steal! -Mozzarella sticks: Crispy and cheesy -Spinach Florentine Flatbread: Tasty but very filling -Pan-Seared Potstickers: More like dumplings because they didn't pan fry them enough -Beef Tostadas: Tasty but the tostada was pretty hard -Boneless Wings: You can never go wrong with Garlic Parmesan and BBQ. However, Ghost Pepper was definitely my favorite - spicy but super flavorful. The PB&J totally tastes like Thai curry, which I surprisingly enjoyed. Every 15 minutes or so, we got rounds of the appetizers I just listed. I think we did about 6-7 rounds and we were stuffed! I had a wonderful time feasting and catching up with my boys from high school. Our server Greg was the best!

So here I am at Friday's for a quick meal. First off I've been here many times before from watching the big game and birthday gatherings with friends. Surprisingly I had yet to write a review. Well here we go.        They gave a great two for $20 deal that I indulged in with the wifey. Keep in mind you get what you pay for so the portions are a bit smaller. We have a rewards deal that allowed us to get a complimentary chips and salsa with our meal. I went with the chicken parm with tomato and the Mrs tried the 6 once steak with sweet potato fries. Not too bad and filled us up. Our waiter was very observant and checked in on us periodically for refills and condiments.        This place is always packed on the weekends to capacity and big games forget it. But once your in its a blast with usually a great crowd to have a good time. There's outdoor seating with heaters to keep you warm on those chilly nights.

Ashley J.,"Hayward, CA",204,52,85,3.0,4/24/2017,"I come to this restaurant all the time. I usually like to come during bball games& happy hour- I love their appetizers! I've never really ordered an entree meal, only because the meals never look so great. But this time I decided to pick an entree, and I wasn't too impressed. I chose the shrimp& baby back ribs combo with a baked potato. The shrimp was actually really good, too bad they only gave about 4 pieces. As for the ribs, they were so dry I could barely get the meat off the bones. Then I get to the baked potato and that wasn't so great either. All there was on it was a clump of butter, no seasoning, no cheese, no sour cream. Just butter. I told her I wanted it loaded but I guess she misunderstood, and I would much prefer not to complain.

We also had 2 sizzling chicken and shrimps and let me tell you, it WAS NOT sizzling at all. They served our dishes with sliced pieces of the sandwhich American cheese on top of our vegetables. Seriously? It was so cold and it didn't even melt which it should have if it was ""sizzling"". The waiter was this chick who was a complete bimbo and did nothing to compensate for the inconvenience.

I ordered the southern style chicken burger because it looked good in the picture. When it came it was soggy. On top of that when I was picking my side, our server, JULIAN, recommended rice with my meal. I was astonished the fact that he would offer knowing that my order was a burger. I wanted to ask him if he ever tried rice on the side when he eats a burger. It sparked in my mind that the reason why he offered it was because I am Asian. I decided to go for lemon butter broccoli. I was surprised that when it came, it was still inside a plastic bag that recently was just microwaved. I totally lost my appetite. It was disgusting.

I expected that when I paid $17.80 for pasta that said it was 1430 calories on their menu I would receive a decent meal with leftovers. Instead, i got a small portion which hardly filled me up.

Monique A.,"Pittsburg, TX",935,327,1180,2.0,3/9/2016,I wished I could give a better review but sitting at the door waiting to be seated for five minutes was disappointing. When you stand there and five employees including the manager do not even attempt to help you can leave a bad taste in your mouth.  Finally a busser helped us and he was very pleasant.  Once we got seated we were greeted by a very friendly server named Gregg. He took our order and helped me with a drink choice. Which I ordered a blended Mango and strawberry Margarita. It tasted great!  My husband ordered the Jack Daniels ribeye with mash potatoes and broccoli. The ribeye was a little tough but to be expected since our first choice was Texas Roadhouse and they were packed.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail and a back potato. The shrimps were slightly over cooked and they are certainly not prawns but the average size you normally see. The baked potato was the best part of our meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=20

Walked in, waitress said it'd be around ten minutes till we'd be seated. I looked around - half the place was empty, but okay. We ordered fish and chips, half rack of ribs, and some burger.  Fish and chips were alright, but came out cold and pathetic looking. The fries were soggy. Taste-wise, they weren't horrible. Can't imagine any place fucking up fish and chips lol. Ribs were a joke. Half a rack of ribs was smaller than my hand. They were some piglet ribs cause that shit was tiny as hell and filled NOBODY up. Moreover, they were super overcooked and crispy, and barely had any barbecue sauce on them at all.  Burger was meh.  Overall, huge disappointment and waste of money.

Michelle C.,"San Francisco, CA",357,155,422,3.0,5/23/2017,"I've been here several times over the years, for all types of celebrations (Birthdays, Mother's Day, etc.) The last time my family was here was for Mother's Day. The wait wasn't that long, only about 30 minutes for Sunday @6pm. I think it helped that we were waiting seated inside because the hostess was aware of our presence and seated us sooner than I had anticipated. They now have ipad type machines on each of the tables that I assume you can order and play games on. Ours was broken so I don't know why it wasn't just removed (it took up a lot of unnecessary space!)  The burger that my sister and I shared was delicious but the reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because of the service; it could've been better. When my dad ordered, he had ordered the Jack Daniels BBQ ribs. However, what came was just regular ribs, lightly coated in sauce... We noticed the difference between my mom's Jack Daniels ribs and his and asked the waitress why his was different. She said it was because his meal did not come with the Jack Daniels option. She could've told him that when he ordered; that definitely could've altered his decision. His meal also came with two sides but the french fries did not come out. He reminded her to bring the fries twice because she had forgotten to get them again.. Lastly, my sister noticed some small plastic pieces in her water. She initially shrugged it off because she thought it was ice but when she couldn't chew it down, she spit it out. I told our waiter, and she her response was, ""Ew, what is that?!""... I have no clue what that was! We paid with gift cards that my mom had which was also a confusing process.

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,4.0,4/11/2016,"We went to TGIF's for a late business lunch.  The establishment was clean and the staff was very friendly.  Service was terrific. We had the Ribs and JD Chicken.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the chicken breast was actually tender and not tough as most breasts are.  Well done.  The Ribs were very tasty and the sauce was great.  The salad that was served with it was ok, however the way to end it great was with the Oreo Madness.  Sooooooo good.   I have not been to TGIF in quite some time and this establishment gave me a reason to come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=60
Omar T.,"Oakland, CA",87,2,,1.0,8/6/2017,"We usually go to FRIDAYS at least once or twice a week. We always sit at the bar... The bartenders are always great. However, the manager that was on tonight was pathetic. There was a item on the menu that included Kale... well when the salad arrived it had no Kale in it.  Normally I would write this off as a mistake, but this makes the THIRD TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED, at this RESTURANT.   The bar staff informed the manager and he said the best he could do was a 20 percent reduction on our total bill. He should have comped the salad... period. The fact that they have had no Kale in a salad they advertise is straight up bullshit. To be honest, I don't think they have ever served that item correctly.   I also happened to walk by the kitchen on the way to the FILTY BATHROOM. Fixtures on the sink was broken and someone had over flowed the toilet with SHIT. Passing back by the kitchen, was even worst, dirty serving tables, garbage cans near food waiting to be served, floors were filthy and slick, one young person was pulling back his hair, never stopping once to WASH HIS NASTY ASS HANDS. I am so disappointed on how management is letting FRIDAY's TURN INTO A DUMP. I plan to call the health department on Monday . Corporate needs to come in there and clean up this place and replace or retrain the management.

The hostess asked how many and just stood there. She didn't write our names down or checked to see what the tables we could sit at. She just stood there looking at the ceiling. Was she high? How can you ask us how many and then stand there? Then a server came and said there were no more booths, only tables. Not that I had a problem, but there were so many booths still available.

I love the stripes reward program. We always try to come in on bartender Desiree's shift. She remembers what we drink and always has a smile. The manager Mike always seems to be present and engaged in what's going on in the restaurant. If all TGI Fridays were run this way, with the caliber of employees like this one, they'd take over the world! I feel a need to shout out to the most excellent servers who take care of us, Oliver is exceptional, he remembers what we like and is on top of any requests we might have. Jaidah (sp?) is another quality server who anticipates our needs and delivers some of the best service around.

Lauren T.,"San Leandro, CA",1,29,4,1.0,10/5/2016,"I hate writing negative reviews, I hardly ever do, but I had to at least say something because their service was so ridiculous. We came in on a Tuesday night at 8pm. It looked like it might be busy, lots of cars in the parking lot. We were told to wait 5-10mins to be seated, so we thought ok thats not too bad. 15 mins go by and we looked at the seating area, and there were SO many open tables, pretty much everywhere it was empty except the bar area where they kept telling people they could sit. 8 men came in and they were directed to that area because of ""lack of seating""....thats a large party, why would you want them crammed in the bar, where they might not order as much due to lack of table space? Loosing $$ for sure by doing this. One mom and daughter were ahead of us, they looked like they had been waiting a while and they finally got seated about 5 mins before us. We should have left after we saw them walk out about 5 mins later shaking their heads. After they left, they sat us at a dirty table (when there were TONS of clean tables already set next to us). The girl said your server will be here shortly...another almost 5 mins go by and no server so I press the ""call server"" button on the tablet at the table. We gave it another 5 mins and then my husband and I were so fed up we walked out too. We went to Chevy's near by and were immediately seated, given menus and food in the same amount of time that it took for us just to walk out of TGI Friday's. We have both worked in food service (for many many years) and this was just unacceptable. Its not like they were short staffed, there were 3 girls standing up front talking, and then occasionally a male server as well. Plus we saw about 6 other servers zipping about, but when you have 4 servers standing up front for 20 mins talking you have a management and staff problem. My recommendation to management (having management experience myself): Keep an eye on your FOH staff, they are not doing their jobs and you are loosing customers as a result. You lost my husband and I AND the mother and daughter before us. Plus the large group of men who went to the bar area instead of being seated right away at a large table - believe me it was empty enough to combine tables together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=60

Suddenly the store manager came and asked is everything okay? My girlfriend said ""it's funny you're asking that, my boyfriend just found a nail in his food.""  The nail was rusty, black and looked dirty. He immediately took the plate and did not allow us to take any pictures. We were also very shocked at the moment. We didn't react fast enough to take a picture which i completely regret. The man who took our burger (manager i believe) was very shocked and surprised.  A few other issues i had was that my food took more than one hour to be ready. The appetizer (mozzarella sticks took 25 minutes, These were very delicious). It wasn't a good day. I am sure not everyone will  have the same bad experience as me.

C C.,"Hayward, CA",1,102,8,1.0,9/14/2017,"This TGI Friday's has to be the worst in California! I took my wife to this TGI Fridays for dinner on her ""Birthday"" 9/10/17 around 6:00 to 6:15 pm. When we walked in there was 3 people standing near the door (inside)  They wrote our name down and told us it will be 15 mins to get a both/table and we are next. We agreed to wait. After sitting for 30 mins and customers being seated before us, the employee told us to stand by the booth where the dirty dishes are and someone will come by to clean it. We stood there for a couple of mins and I told my wife just sit down someone will come by and clean it. It took another 5 - 10 mins for someone to clean off the table. Nobody brought us a menu and we sat there waiting for the waitress/waiter to bring us one while looking at this electronic machine on the table. 20 mins as past and still no waitress. Finally I tried to flag someone down by saying excuse me but they were walking the other direction (they had to hear me because they were only 1 table across from us and it was not that busy) I decided to get up and ask the host by the front door for a menu. They said ""Oh sure here is a couple of menu's"" It was around 7:30pm and finally a waitress walked by and we were ready to order food.  She never asked us if we wanted anything to drink (which most restaurants do) We ordered 2 appetizers and dinner 1 coke & 1 Margarita. My appetizer came around 7:45 pm close to 8:00 pm then came my dinner not to long after and my wife's dinner. My wife asked the waitress what happen to her appetizer? She said ""Oh you did not get it"" My wife said no. So she went back to the kitchen asking about the appetizer she ordered. 8:15 pm comes now 8:30 pm. Finally we got the appetizer to go at 8:30 pm and she refills my soda with diet coke instead of regular... SMH... We got up from the table walked over to towards the door and left because our night was ruined and we had plans after diner but it got to late. When we got home I decided to call the manager on duty his name is ""MATT""  I simply explained what happen and he told me. Why did you leave and not come/talk to me first?  Now I am thinking well it's my wife's birthday and I do not want to make it any worse by arguing even though the evening is already ruined. I told said What would you have done if I did come to you before we left? He said "" we would have given you a free appetizer. I laughed and said  The appetizer was 1/2 off special already. My Appetizer is normally $10.00 and I paid $5.00 so you are going to give me my appetizer for free saving $5.00 Wow how generous! The bill was $52.00 and my wife even tipped the waitress. I said how about cut the bill in half and we will call it even. He said I can't do that.  I called the 1-800 number and spoke to someone and they offered a $10.00 gift card for the bad service. I said you are offering us a $10.00 gift card for lousy service that took 3 hours to be seated and be waited on are you serious? I said there was several people coming in after us and being waited on before us. They even got their food before we did. Here is what should have happen that night. 1) 15 mins to be seated (not 30 mins) 2) Host should walk the guest to a clean table (NOT DIRTY) and hand both of us menus. Then in less than 5 to 10 mins  3) Waitress/Waiter should then ask the normal everyday question ""Can i start you off with something to drink""    4) Waitress/Waiter should then come back in 2 to 5 mins to take our order 5) Appetizers should be on the table before the main meal 6) The meal comes 10 to 15 mins later after the appetizer 7)  Waitress/Waiter normally asked if you need any refills or how is the food, is everything okay? 8)  Waitress/Waiter usually ask if you need a to go box if you have food left over. 9)  Waitress/Waiter then bring you the check/bill for check out 10) Guest usually leaves a small tip if the service was good Going to a restaurant should not take no more than 1 hour to be seated waited on and eat food. (depending if it's really really crowded)  Not 3 hours! 6 pm to 8:45pm ? Hometown Buffet is 100x better than this TGI Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=80

I ordered a Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta and asked for extra sauce. She asked which one Cajun or Alfredo and I said Cajun. She warned me of it being spicy and I said bring it on.  About 5-10 minutes later my order came out and she said the cook out extra peppers. I didn't mean to it eat it all in one sitting but I did and enjoyed it.  Food was served hot and fresh off the line.  I know it can be hit or miss but it was all a hit this time. Keep it up TGi!!!

The food at TGIF in general is usually amazing.. But we avoid this place like the plague, simply because of how bad the service has gotten. Door staff is unpleasant and rude, you have to get their attention and they respond to you as if you are in the wrong for interrupting their non-work related conversations. Orders have been messed up here the past two times we've been here.. Wait takes forever.. Wait staff could care less about what you need.. Staff is in accommodating. And I have no idea, how, with a state university, and 2 junior colleges within 7 miles of this place, hey have such incompetent employees! Extremely rude... Don't understand.. Don't even care to!  I'm not even sure I could hire such horrible staff on purpose if someone told me to try my best.  We've now started hitting up the chills next door instead..  Save yourself the hassle.. People dine out to receive a service... You're better off staying in and trying to cook yourself rather than heading to this place.. I've been coming to this place since I was a kid and when Union landing was first built. I have vowed to never to return again. Ps - I didn't catch the names of all the bad ones we've had to deal with, but today's horrible service was brought to us by Sahille..

She got me a beer at happy hour price even though we were seated less than 5 minutes before it ended which I do appreciate. We then told her that we wanted to do endless apps so she came back with a special menu. I'm not quite sure why they don't just include it with the main menu, but once she brought it out, she explained how it works. There are 2 sides to this special menu. The $10 side lets you pick any one item and they will continue to only bring that item until you are full. But for $2 more, ($12) you flip the menu and you can choose between boneless wings, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, pot stickers, etc. and switch between any of them until you are full.  If you are dining in with friends, my suggestion is to pay $10 for the wings and all of the different flavors and then pay $12 to try out the other apps. As long as you order 1 extra refill, it's already worth it! Overall, the food was pretty good and the service was quite fast on Wednesday. Highlight of the night was Sadia!

I have not been to a Fridays in years and years, and don't seem to remember it impressing me much way back then, so I was pleasantly surprised here! First off, our waiter was awesome, very sweet and attentive and kept our water glasses full and  came to check on us several times!! My husband and I both ordered the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta and the fried mozzarella appetizer. The appetizer was nice, and the pasta dish was really, really good and had just the right amount of spicy kick to it. Our daughter ordered the Jack Daniels chicken and that sauce was so good! We also got the Tennessee whisky cake for dessert to share, and wow, that was one delicious dessert! Way better than I expected! I do agree with some of the other reviewers though about small portions, the pasta dish seemed small, and that was disappointing as usually pasta dishes are ample and filling... plus I was really hungry!

And really no effort was put into the presentation. Same for my super hot girlfriends steak and lobster plate. Don't get me wrong I like jack Daniels sauce and I still ate it and it tasted ok, but it just doesn't seem like people cared all that much of what they were serving.

Really? Like seriously, really?! Wouldn't it have been more effective and meaningful to just go ask the manager what she could do? Why do I need to fill something out in order to get taken care of? Perhaps the cook should take the damn survey so that I can get taken care of because this was their error not mines. My survey is this yelp review that this place consistently gives poor service.

Alicia R.,"28 Palms, Fremont, CA",103,1,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Service was ridiculous, we were sat by the host with the long braids & glasses. Sat at the first booth to the left, we were left un-greeted for 25 minutes, my friend & myself are both in the restraint industry, & at our job we are supposed to greet our tables within the first 30 seconds, there were about 4-5 servers in the little side station by the booth who kept looking over at us & how we were not attended. This is literally so ridiculous, I then got up and went to the host and asked if there were a server in my section, and she replied ""oh yeah we're trying to figure that out right now"" and I replied ""why were we sat in a section where there was no server"" and she came over to our table and said ""I'll just move you guys over to another table so you can have a server"" my friend then said ""why haven't we been greeted"" and the host replied with ""sorry there's nothing I can do"" I'm a very rude tone, we were then sat in the first booth in the bar and were still NOT greeted for about 7 minutes, and the manager came over, very inconsiderate to what was going on, did not apologize for anything and then asked ""would you like me to go get you a server?"" I mean of course, I can't serve myself. I am in a management position and I know that the guest is not always right, but we they are. She said It was very hard to deal with us because we had ""an attitude"" ofcourse we had an attitude, who wouldn't after not being greeted almost half an hour? We sat down a 4:53 & we just left at 5:30. STILL not greeted nothing. This place always has the worst service. The manager was hella rude & your host need to be retrained.

Dararith L.,"San Leandro, CA",52,97,32,5.0,7/14/2016,"I can't possibly fathom why TGI's currently averages 2.5 stars on Yelp.  It's a restaurant chain that easily outclasses its other competitors within its league of similar price range and food type, you know...Applebees, Chili's, etc.  Based on that comparison, I'll be reviewing under that pretext. Allow me to tip the scale a bit. For your typical run of the mill, All-American, fast, sit-down restaurant, TGI's is splendid.  On numerous occasions, I enjoyed the New York steak, ribeye, full rack of pork ribs, shrimp, Bourbon Barrel Mahi Mahi, top sirloin steak, all coupled with potatoes, sweet potato fries (real good!), fresh vegetables, and spinach/garlic.  Veggies are cooked well (nothing special though), and steaks are actually served medium rare like I asked, every time.  And honestly, I think their Jack Daniel's Signature BBQ sauce delicious and goes with just about everything.   They even have calories listed on the menu for each meal for the calorie conscious, and frankly, I think the portions are just fine since I can finish it comfortably.  I can eat a ton more, but the typical American diet has average meals easily in the caloric surplus.  Of course, I'm not one to judge anyone's gluttony, but I'm digressing.  I guess one can argue the price point, but this goes back to other restaurants within the same league that are of similar price.  The difference?  The food quality of TGI's is easily in the upper band; it just tastes better.  Also, service has been attentive every time and the cocktail selection is numerous. What else is there to judge for a restaurant of this caliber?  Despite the welcoming name to come on Fridays, don't.  Especially on a Friday evening -- place is packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=100

The onion rings were hard as rocks and way over cooked, the mozzarella sticks were cold (like how the hell do you serve cold mozzarella sticks).

Sivilay T.,"Orinda, CA",69,735,1929,4.0,3/8/2015,"Last time I was here was in 2011, so I can say that I haven't been to a TGIF's in years...literally. My younger sister and I just finished having dinner at around 9:30 PM at Tadamasa so we decided to go walk at Wal-Mart and buy some thank you cards to send out for our mom's wedding from last week.  We bought our cards and decided to stay at that McDonald's to write the cards so we can get them out of the way.  While we were there, we had a few unwelcome visitors stop by so as soon as we were done with the last card, we hurried our little behinds out of there and started searching for a nearby spot to hang out and chat.  When we found out that TGIF doesn't close until 1:30 AM, we made our way over. As soon as we both walked in, we were sweetly greeted by the hostess.  She was about to show us to our table, but since we had just eaten, we just asked if it would be ok for us to just sit at the bar.  She looked at us and smiled.  She told us she'll check and brought back a guy to check our ID's.  We were both surprised, and thought she was so cute that we'd need to be carded since my sister and I are both in our 30's.  She already gets 5-stars right off the bat.  Lol Once we made our way to the bar, we were sweetly greeted by our bartender, Rabi.  He asked us what we wanted to drink and I asked for a virgin pina colada and my younger sister asked for a vanilla shake.  He was probably thinking ""what the heck are these women ordering?""  Lol But he was so sweet and just smiled and told us he would have our drinks in a few minutes.  I don't think they normally even make vanilla shakes, but he made it for us any way... We ordered two appetizers, even though we already had dinner not too long ago.  The bacon mac n cheese bites was on the salty side, but the Tuscan spinach dip was actually good.  Although the tostada strips smelled like it was deep fried in old cooking oil. I would normally rate the food at a 2, but the service definitely kicks it up to a 4-star.  Being that we were seated at the bar and ordered non alcoholic beverages, the bartender was still sweet and friendly.  He checked on us multiple times to make sure we were doing alright and according to my younger sister, she says ""we'll definitely be back if Rabi is working.""  Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=100

Mom's coupon was about to expire so we drove on over to the neighborhood Friday's for an early dinner at 5pm Saturday night. Staff welcome was on point! All of the wait staff had easygoing smiles and two of them were stationed at each door up front to cheerfully greet everyone entering. Now that's how to engage with customers. No wait to get seated but hosts did have a bit of a mix up on where to seat us since it wasn't busy yet. Tables and drink/dessert menus could have been wiped down a bit more, but not a big deal. The fam got steak & lobster tail and steak & salmon plates while I got a Caesar salad with 4oz steak. Lobster is either steamed or grilled. Kevin suggested grilled for more flavor, but it sticks to the shell. Still good though! Jasmine rice pilaf is tasty and has the right texture here! Great accompaniment to meat or fish for the rice fanatics. My only issue is not receiving my Caesar dressing on the side, despite the confirmation. I didn't bother saying anything cuz I didn't want to waste food. Soft pretzels with cheese & bacon dip are always good here! Perfect size for 4. Shrimp cocktail tasted like the typical frozen kind. Drinks all around! I swear, after my sis turned 21 I'm pretty sure we're becoming an alcoholic fam haha! JK. Tried the Mandrin Mule-- tasted like soda with a hint of orange! I really liked this. Sis got a sweet Mixed Berry Mojito, good as well. Mom got a Prosecco bottle and Dad a glass of red wine. Might try the blended Frose next time. The Zoosk pay machine had a broken receipt slot issue but we still paid using it after redeeming our coupon personally. All in all, great place to have drinks and a comforting meal. Happy hour sounds like a good deal to unwind any day of the week! They're open until 1am weekdays and 2am weekends.

Weeks back, my boyfriend and I walked in and the first time around we got a group of employees chit chatting, not greeting us, and all made eye contact with us and proceeded to walk away. Then this second time around on Friday around 7 or so on November 24th, 2017, we got one female, whom also did not greet us, instead made eye contact with us for a couple seconds without saying a single word, until I said Hello?! and still got nothing, so I said ""just two"" and even then she walked away to check which table was available and then came back and told us to follow her with the most least enthusiasm and just gave us the menu, no silverware. Then our waiter literally told us that he SAW our appetizer sitting there ready to be taken to us but walked away and came back and it was gone?! So therefore we got our appetizer until way after our meal, not to mention we had to wait for our silverware then we had asked for extra ranch and jack daniels sauce which also took long.

Fran R.,"Milpitas, CA",104,155,272,4.0,3/31/2017,"Having the frozen Mozarella sticks for years from Target or Costco, I have never once stepped foot in a TGI.  Our recent trip to TGI was both interest and gift card based- I mean, a meal on someone else- why not? :) We came on Thursday and there was a bit of a busy lobby. The hostess told us it would be a 25 minute wait, and took our contact information to text us when our table was ready. The ease of contact was so convenient and made it easy for us to wait in the car without having an obnoxious vibrating buzzer interrupting. Or, the germs those carry! At about 21 minutes through, we received a text message and were ready to eat! Our waitress was beautiful and fun, her name was Marjorie and she was very attentive and friendly. Within 2 minutes of ordering drinks, she brought it our way, and was very quick on her feet.  For our appetizer we ordered the mozarella sticks which were sold out! My dream of fresh ones was foiled, but next time I will plan to come at an earlier time in the day. In substitution we ordered potato skins and requested the bacon to be excluded from the recipe. Marjorie put in our order and ten minutes after, we're munching on our potato skins telling her things were great between a mouthful of cheese!  The potato skins were very good, I preferred them with ketchup to the sour cream, but they were the only dish lacking presentation. The cheese used is a kraft or packaged sliced cheese, making it look a bit 'at home' like, but nonetheless, very tasty! Next time, we will order mozarella sticks though, the potatoes weren't much to write home about. Our main entree was burger themed! According to Yelp reviews here, there was no consistency with what to order , so we gambled on burgers.  My boyfriend ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and I ordered the Black Bean Chipotle Burger! I totally appreciated that being a quality vegetarian option, since the pasta dishes were covered in chicken or meat, making it a bit difficult to find some good options with protein. Not even fifteen minutes after our appetizer, we receive our entrees - which was surprisingly fast! The staff really makes sure the customers are fed and not irritable, which was completely appreciated.  My boyfriend's seal of approval was cleaning his plate and nodding with a smile! I couldn't believe it! My burger was very well made. The bun used is a sweet roll similar to Hawaiian bread, with a mild chipotle mayo sauce combination, lettuce, avocado, tomato, onion, on the black bean burger. The combination was both flavorful, and satisfying, taking into account that many vegetarian options are blander or very unseasoned. :) I was pleasantly surprised! For anyone looking to order this meal, it tastes like black beans and a soft bean veggie mix- so if you're looking for a meat alternative TASTING like meat, this wouldn't be a good substitute but it's just as tasty! For dessert we ordered the fudge brownie with vanilla bean icecream! I imagined a more structured foundation of brownie, but it was more pudding/molten lava fudge mixed with brownie pieces so it's very very soft. Less cakey! The vanilla icecream was mildly sweet staying true to vanilla flavor, not overwhelmingly sweet like artificial icecream. What's great is all desserts are similarly priced so there's no loss in money or choices. Overall we give TGI four stars for amazing service, and food. We both agreed upon leaving we would definitely return, which was a big plus!

Eboney G.,"Oakland, CA",12,37,32,1.0,6/23/2017,"HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT! STAFF HAS NO ACCOUNTABILITY!  Boyfriend and I went here for dinner on last Saturday night. Service was extremely slow for no freaking reason! When we were finally greeted we ordered: Appetizer: Potstickers. They were black on one side and undercooked on the other side.   Entree: He had a slider and some wings. No issues. I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp. It comes on a hot plate and should come out ""sizzling"" hence the name. Supposed to have chicken breast, 2 kinds of melted cheese, sautéed peppers and onions, and Cajun shrimp. I substituted the Cajun shrimp for fried jack Daniels shrimp. 2 sides. This BULLSHIT hit the table and I thought I was being PUNKED!!!! The chicken came out lukewarm. The fucking cheese was still cold (I.e. I could see a square slice of American cheese just slapped on top of the damn chicken). The white shredded cheese was still in shreds and cold. Shrimp cold. I ordered a side of mixed veggies, it looked like they were all raw!!! It was embarrassing!!! And not to mention they gave me the wrong damn shrimp.  The cold part is, is we waited nearly 30 mins for that crap. The guy who brought our food (not our server) didn't seem to give a rats ass about how my food looked, and simply said ""uh, do you want me to take it back for you?"" I wanted to scream. He should've never brought it out like that! It should have never left the kitchen this way.  Told him it was ok, could he just grab our server. He rolls his eyes a little and says ok. WELL IT TAKES DAMN NEAT 10 MORE MINS FOR THE SERVER TO COME OVER. HE SAYS THE GUY NEVER TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE. So I proceed to tell the server, he half listens to what I was saying and says he'll have them re-do it with a half assed sentiment. He didn't give a f--k either. I said nah I'm good. I don't want anything else. He walks off.  I ask another person for the manager. The manager finally comes, and PLOPS HIS ASS DOWN IN OUR BOOTH LAUGHING AND SMILING LIKE WE WERE ALL ABOIT TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE DINNER TOGETHER. JUST A COMPLETE JOKE and unprofessional. I told him my issue...........drumroll please.......... he didn't give a shit either!! We ended up leaving without eating anything. Our dinner was ruined and we had a movie to get to. He then says, ""LOOK, MY NAMES MATT (or James or whatever) THE NEXT TIME YOU COME, ASK FOR ME ILL TAKE CARE OF YOU!  Yeah thank you, but NO THANK YOU. THAT was your time to take care of us. Fridays management is a joke and it all trickles down to the staff. Management sets the tone      No wonder why they have a 2 star rating.

I haven't been to TGI Friday's since 2007, and it was the location that used to be in Cupertino, and I do not remember it being like this. I suppose this may be a franchise location, or the quality of food and service has diminished for this establishment over the last decade. I brought my mom here for dinner, as she has never been to a Fridays and I remember them being ok (well, was about to look like a fool for suggesting this place...) We walked in, and no one in sight,except for customers. We waited about three minutes to be seated to a table with fresh drink rings left on the table as well as someones leftover dessert on my moms side.They didnt bother to wipe it down until she asked about halfway through our dinner. Strangely enough, we were given different menus. Apparently,there is an old one and a revised one, which is shorter. We noticed when half of the pages were missing from hers. We asked the waiter about it and that is what he told us, before switching out the old one. I ordered a burger with a side of mayo as well as a salad and a side of loaded mashed potatoes. The food would come out all together.The salad came out with the food (WTF) The burger came with no mayo, which was the only thing that I had asked for on it. And the mashed potatoes, were not loaded, they were not mashed really. They were INSTANT potatoes? At a restaurant? For an additional $3? Really? They couldn't get anything right on this visit and I refuse to go back due to the quality of food.

Evelynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",827,366,884,2.0,11/25/2013,"I'm still quite baffled by how much quality has gone down over the years at this particular Friday's restaurant. I used to be such a big fan of T.G.I. Friday's, I might even have called it my favorite restaurant. Unfortunately from my past visits, I have slowly watched the quality slowly die.  Last night (Sunday), Friday's was crowded, but it wasn't exceptionally crowded. We were able to be seated within 10-15 minutes vs. the 30-40 min wait we were used to. Which is good. Except -- after we were seated, we had to wait another 15 minute before a waiter came by and introduced himself and asked us if we wanted anything to drink, by then all four of us had already decided what we wanted to eat for dinner. Meanwhile, we watched 4-5 different waiters/waitresses walk past our table serving everyone else food. - 1 5 min later, he brought us our drinks, there was something in my drink. But he noticed it as soon as he put it down on the table, which is good. Except after he brought me a new drink, there was still something inside... -1 Another 10-15 min went by and we all got our orders. Reasonable amount of wait time at a Friday's restaurant, so I figured what the heck, no complaints here. Except my sirloin that I ordered medium well was super well done, dry, and difficult to chew/swallow. My mom's, on the other hand, was ordered well done but her's was juicy and semi-bloody. Either the chef/waiter got it mixed up, or they have consistency issues. Either way, -1. Also my GRILLED shrimp was cold and flavorless, and my sweet potato fries amounted to barely a small handful.  Waiter overall polite enough, not especially friendly or memorable. It really used to be whenever my parents asked where I wanted to go for dinner, I would by default answer ""Fridays!"" But now, I have several choices, and it's usually not Friday's anymore.  Verdict: Would go, but only rarely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=120

Does it make any sense that our appetizers came during the meal rather than prior to? We ordered plain pasta but it came with peppers. We ordered fish and chips and the coleslaw was very weird looking so we switched it for mac and cheese (which never arrived to our table). We also ordered a sizzling cheese and srimp plate, which never arrived either. Typically refills are brought out in new glasses but not here, my coffee xup was clearly stained with my lipstick however the waitress still look the cup into the back and brought it back out refilled with coffee but no additional creamer. Our table was loaded with menus that were never taken away and dirty dishea that we had to lift onto the window seal to sit comfortably. Our waitress did not come back to our table to check on us or to see if we needed anything, she just came for drink orders and food orders. The resturant was very empty when we had arrived so it cant be that they were packed.

We chose the bar because I wanted to watch the game and get my drinks faster. We ordered some buffalo wings and a couple budweisers from the HH menu. Thinking we'd make the movies on time ..  For a first time EVER at a TGIF's .. this place proved EVERYTHING anybody has ever said in regards to the chain to be true. Food is bland and overpriced .. that's about it. It has a bar and the ambiance looks a little higher quality than applebee's but .. that's about it.  Buffalo Wings - I looked at it a good minute before eating it .. and that's a good minute on top of already being late for the movies. So it's from some scrawny chicken - that's fine. I think they oven roast it then twirl it around in some buffalo sauce .. because the drumsticks and wings weren't just small, they were pretty much dehydrated and on their way to being burnt, too.  Service - The girls were nice. They didn't seem to care for being at work, though. Smiled and everything but it was late and they were working - it just makes sense.  Left the place leaving a 20something % tip because our bartender/server was really nice and did her best to smile every time she asked us if we were okay.

My husband and I came here after a long work day and ordered our usual appetizer, Jack Daniel's chicken strips.  When our order came, my husband and I looked at each other like ""wtf?"" Did they drop the other half on the way to the table or something?  When our server came back, we asked why our order was so skimpy. She replied ""I'm sorry, I know... they rip you off here"" and then asked what else we needed. Ummm okay.  Not very professional. I was starving so I started eating the sad looking appetizer.  Fast forward to the bill.... damn chicken was $11.  My husband handed the bill and his card to the server and I asked to speak to the manager... I'm not one to complain or make a huge deal about things but the appetizer was almost the price of my entrée, which would be fine if I had gotten the whole order.  The ""manager"" walks over to the table already looking irritated. I explain to him why I was disappointed in the meal and how they need to be consistent with their portions. I told him we are regulars and have never received a portion so small.  He says portions are always the same and blah blah... but he says he will take them off the bill pretty much rolling his eyes and walks off. Our server came seconds later handing my husband the original check for him to sign. My husband notices that the price on the check is more then the one she had given him before he put his card. I believe it was a $4 difference. So when the manager comes back with the new tab.. I show him the two different checks from the server and he pretty much snatches them from my hand and tells me to forget that tab because he brought a new one. This passes me off because he's not even trying to explain how she was gonna show me one total and then charge my husband another. He tries to get an attitude, and my husband had to tell him to not come at me like that. I never raised my voice or came at him crazy.  He finally apologized and says he doesn't know how why she did that. Half a**. Worst service ever.  Pay attention to your tabs when coming here. Oh, and your portions.

My husband and I ordered a steak and lobster. My son ordered a child's cheese burger. We asked for our steaks to be cooked medium well and when we got our steaks they were well done, the lobsters were salty and the baked potato was bland. My son said his burger tasted like his schools cafeteria lunch and my margarita tasted watered down more ice than any alcohol.

Alicia C.,"San Leandro, CA",127,230,68,2.0,11/25/2015,"One of my friends and I were catching up and were celebrating my belated 30th with some drinks and apps. I had never been before last week, but had seen commercials about their amazing appetizers, so I thought what the heck.  The bar was bustling and busy. There were a few sports games going on. We sat in the bar surrounded by several televisions. Too bad I'm not a sports fan because it would have been a dream come true.  It was happy hour, so my friend and I got two margaritas. I got the Mango Berry blended and loved it. I do highly recommend that drink. Got me pretty buzzed as well. Pretty generous in alcohol.  For apps, we tried the mozzarella sticks, ahi tuna chip bites, and the sesame chicken tenders.  - the mozzarella sticks were fine. Nothing special.  - the ahi tuna was a mess. It wasn't seared properly, and ended up getting the chip soggy. The fish was grisly and you couldn't take a clean bite without struggling with the fish. Good flavor but technically a flop.  - the chicken was great. Good flavor and crispy on the outside. However, they were on the border of being burnt they were so dark.  I also ordered the clam chowder. Not pleased. It had a weird flavor and color. I could barely taste the clams either.  I would return for drinks a few of the apps (after carefully reading reviews next time), but I will most likely not order from the meal menu considering my friend did not like her pasta dish and I really disliked the clam chowder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=140

Amy T.,"Union City, CA",1680,294,2246,4.0,9/22/2012,"I forgot the last time I came here for dinner but just recently I came here for their Happy Hour which was at 10pm til closing for my friend's 21st Birthday. At first it was really packed even on a Tuesday night and we thought we weren't going to get seats but luckily we found two tables that we could put together with a party of about 9 people.  Their Happy Hour selection is pretty good. Drinks are good and fairly priced and food is delicious and pretty cheap. Depending on the time you get there and what day you go on, it is usually packed near the area near the bar because of Happy Hour.  I would say my two favorite drinks on the Happy Hour menu is the Strawberry Margarita and the Mango Margarita. Both are fruity drinks and don't have much alcohol in them. They usually serve them with fruits as well. The food that I always get during Happy Hour because it is worth it because it is only $1.50 is the basket of fries. Had their loaded potato skins too and I have to say it wasn't that bad either for the amount they give you and the price of $4.50 because it was half off. I also have to say that the Jack Daniels sauce is the bomb! I will come back to this place for Happy Hour again and try more of their drinks and food! Cheap and good!

Dmitry j.,"Union City, CA",6,9,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Went there with friends for a dinner. The seating was very crammed. We were sitting in the isle close to the kitchen and there wasn't enough room to seat comfortable and for waiters and guests to walk by easily. Music was very loud and it was very hard to talk. But that not as important. What really ticked me off is the food.  I remembered there mozzarella sticks from back in the day. When we got those cheese sticks, they were nothing what they used to be. They tasted very stale. Moving on to entrees. I ordered some ribs (thankfully only 1/2 rack) and they were overly done. There wasn't much meat and whatever meat was there was very dry. My friends got steaks and those steaks were also horrible.  I think that for a $45 bill per person that is completely unacceptable. It's not OK to have bad food period, but when you're getting robbed while at it... The only thing that made that whole experience better was the full bar I don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=140

We came in, got seated, server took our order, we ate, and we left. Typical restaurant visit.  On our last visit to TGIF, we had the most awful experience. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted. I didn't think anything of that. It took the host a while to seat us and I had no idea why. There were so many tables open. We didn't feel welcomed. It was BLAH to say the least.  Our server, Ericka, paid absolutely no attention to us. She walked really fast past our table a few times. No smile. No greetings. Nothing. Just ""what can I get for you?"" I was thankful that the food came out fast, but after two bites of my food, she came by with our check. My boyfriend and I felt rushed. We wanted to enjoy our dinner. We never order dessert at restaurants and that night was one of the rare nights that we wanted dessert. After about five minutes, she came back and asked if we wanted anything else, as if she didn't just put the check on our table. We didn't feel like getting dessert anymore.

Not to mention it was half off; Happy hour on the appetizer menu all day on Sunday! The rib eye steak though, I wasn't too impressed because the beef was not a good quality of beef, it was like something I can get from Denny's but in J.D. sauce.  We also ordered their Bloody Marry with Grey Goose, it was in a huge glass cup that only costed $8; we will definitely coming back here but I will probably only order their chicken wings and some drinks to go along with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=240

Happy hour apps that's half off,  regular (big!) portions and extremely tasty? I'm so there. My regular menu: -chicken wings, sauce on the side. Always crispy and juicy! -beer cheese pretzels. Always comes out with crispy edges and piping hot. A fave. -$1.50 cheeseburger sliders. Love the char grilled taste, with cartelized onions. Makes it seem gourmet. -fries basket- simple, extremely cheap and good. - chicken quesadilla - large portion, pretty good. Can get a variety of good drinks for $3-5. Tip: try their Wednesday special. Rack of jack Daniels ribs for only $10.99 I think. Plus, add on a gigantic beer for $3. Love their fall off the bone ribs!

I drove up the road a couple of miles to the TGI Friday's at Union Landing for lunch -- overall, not the best choice. When I arrived, the two girls at the front seemed a little confused but seated me promptly at a booth and presented me with the menu and walked away ... no drink order??  She came back about five minutes later and asked if I wanted something to drink and I ordered an iced tea.  She brought me an ""iced"" tea -- sans ice and room temperature.  Another 10 minutes passed before my server, Devon, came by to take my order. I mentioned that it had been 10 minutes, and all Devon could seem to manage was an ""I appologize"" and a weak excuse that he had been taking care of a large party.. I could see his large party.. all of six people!! Hmmm??? I had the Dragonfire Chicken with jasmine rice and broccoli.  The meal came out in about l4 minutes (yes, I timed it).  The meal was just OK, not a lot of flavor but at least the chicken was fully cooked and still moist. I was never asked if I wanted a refill on the ""iced"" tea as my empty glass sat at the edge of the table for the last half of my meal. Devon eventually came by and asked if I had finished and wanted the check.  Still no offer to refill the drink.

There's an extra charge for them but they look exactly like regular fries and they tasted like only salt and pepper was added. They're supposed to be bottomless but the waiter charged for them as a separate item.  I have to say that service was lacking all around. The entrance is odd in that there isn't room to check in and step aside so everyone stands around and it's just a cluster.... no one is ever at the front when I arrive. This last visit the host showed up, he never welcomed us.  He didn't even say hi. He just asked for the number in our party, said, ""hold on, let me see if there's a table"" and walked away, then returned with,  ""over here"" and proceeded to walk away. I'm smart so I figured out I was supposed to follow. The server had too much to drink the night before and said he was recovering so he wasn't on point. It was more than between five and 10 minutes before he arrived to take drink orders.

Both my wife & I ordered a steak and shrimp meal, though with different sides.  My wife got the Jack Daniels Sirloin and fried shrimp with a side of Parmesan Garlic Fries and a Tomato Mozzarella Salad.  Her steak and shrimp tasted fine, but the fries were drenched in a really heavy sauce, and she barely touched it.  I ordered a Rib-eye steak and added some scampi shrimp, along with a baked potato and the salad.  I ordered my steak medium rare, but it came out of the kitchen very rare.  It tasted fine, but was a lot more chewier than I prefer.  Next time, I'll order my steak medium to get the right texture.

I see the happy hour menu that is all day Sunday and understand why the crowd is how it is, ghetto in all its glory.  The waitress was nice but has no clue about the food or menu. Starters were good and got there quick. Nachos were small for a chain restaurant but were tasty, great boneless buffalo wings, potato skins and mozzarella sticks. The artichoke dip was also good but not enough chips which after asking they brought more. The new jack sampler is generous, the new jack sliders yummy, We asked about vegetarian options for my daughter and dumbly the waitress said we don't have anything vegetarian. We only have a black bean hamburger  lol, #clueless. I also asked her if the dish I was asking for had ""caprese salad"" because I couldn't make it out from the picture in the menu and she said no ""its basil, tomatoes and mozzarella"" once again  lol!!! The chips the show on the menu didn't come with the dip and the portion of my plate was smaller than what you saw on the menu. The rice and the steak with the langostino lobster was delicious just small. My kids enjoyed their burgers as well and my husband. Drink wise the margaritas were big and made correctly as well as the mai thai. All in all I gave it 3 stars because of the annoying crowd and un-informed waitress.

When they arrived we realized that the booth wasn't big enough for all of us so we told our waitress we were going to switch tables. She said it was fine but we were going to have a new server.  So we moved tables and no one let anyone know that we had moved so we sat around waiting for about half an hour before asking the hostess if she could find out waitress. Another 15 minutes and we asked one of the other waitresses if we could order who also told us just to wait a minute to find her. Once we found her she promptly apologized for not coming since she saw our appetizers and thought we had been served already.  She was great and nice. But after already waiting almost an hour just to be served the food took way too long. Then for some reason they decided to turn up the volume on the music so loud that we had to yell at each other.  None of the other waitresses seemed to be doing anything that didn't involved their own tables.

It was pretty empty but is was 11AM. We weren't expecting it to be busy. It was pretty clean. No messy tables. Our waitress was pleasant. It took us about an hour to order. We hadn''t spoken to each other for so long that we were catching up and had no time to look at the menu. Our waitress was kind enough to wait and she frequently checked on us to see if we were ready. I ordered the korean wraps, my friend got the salmon and my other friend got the fettuccine. We all had some mozzarella sticks for the appetizer. They were good but i wish they offered more sauce. korean wraps were BOMB!!! I'd order them again. It doesn't come with hot sauce and I had requested some. She said they only had tabasco and wing sauce. she said the wingsauce was pretty hot and I told her I don't mind as long as its okay for me to have some. she brought both of them and i ended up just using the wing sauce. it sure was hot and i only used it sparingly. but it didn't add that kick it needed. if you like spicy i recommend you requesting the sauce its so good!!! i was very happy that the accommodated to my needs. the beef was cooked well it wasn't tough. it came iwth a side of rice and had some cilantro in it. i was kinda confused about it since it was on the side. i guess you can add some in your wrap or eat it on the side. i did both. and it both worked. Its a pretty healthy meal. not friend or drenched in cheese. i was very content with the portion too. DEFINITELY WILL ORDER AGAIN. I had a bit of my friends salmon and shrimp. It was pretty watery.

Michael D.,"Fremont, CA",14,8,5,3.0,8/26/2014,"I went here recently with a couple friends to grab some all-you-can-eat appetizers. We went in pretty late, proabably between 10pm and 11pm. Almost no wait to get seated, which was cool - and not always the case at this location. Everyone in the restaurant was just hanging out it seemed. Not much energy in the air, though. The hostess was nice enough to let us wait for a booth seat, and then take it once her busser was done cleaning it up. That got some brownie points, for sure :). However, we already knew what we wanted and we had no clue who our server was. We inquired with the hostess, who wasn't much help, then I asked another server to help us out and he said he'd let our server know. After a bit of waiting, I finally saw our server approach the booth next to ours, so we finally flagged her down...but then we had to wait while she prepped for a birthday at the table across from us. It took a really long time for her to get things ready and finally come out for the really short birthday song - quite unenethusiastic as those go by the way. Then she FINALLY come and took our order. At this point, we had been waiting about 20 minutes already... The fried mozzarella sticks were very good in my opinion, the buffalo wings were slightly above average. Better with the scorching hot sauce plus the buffalo sauce! The potato skins, however, were terrible. The three of us all started reminiscing about Elephant Bar's potato skins ON THE SPOT! Pass on the potato skins - they're  HUGE let-down! After the huge disappointment, our server was nice enough to let us get the Bruschetta, which was SURPRISINGLY GOOD!!! I usually hate bruschetta, especially from places like this. It's usually too stale with not enough good toppings. The bread was just right, and the toppings were very good, especially the tomatoes. The server stepped it up for sure after the long wait, and a couple of the items were quite good, so this balanced out to 3 stars for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=220

I told them and they said they will bring him one out as fast as they could.  We finished our food but his food was not out yet.

Went again with my husband a few months ago and everything was awful! Both of our knives and forks were filthy, posted pictures already.  We sat in the front where severs go to get drinks and we were annoyed that the severs used that as a hangout spot to sit and gossip. There was always a crowd of severs over there. One girl was off the clock, I'm assuming, and was grabbing herself and her friends drinks. No one seemed to know how to close the door to the ice, which was right below the soda dispenser and there was a lot of crap falling into it.  We got a sampler platter as an appetizer with mozzarella cheese sticks, potato skins, and boneless buffalo things. The ABSOLUTE WORST I've ever had in my life. The cheese sticks weren't ooey gooey, the potato skins were over cooked and bland and the buffalo things were just as bad. The food was even hot.  I ordered steak and lobster tail, there was no flavor to the steak and it was grey(????). the lobster tail wasn't terrible, but not that great. My husband had a steak and mashed potatoes, same problem. Our waiter checked on us a few times and didn't bother checking to see that we needed more water.

So there's how i feel about their service, sub-par to say the least. The happy hour prices are pretty good though and the foods pretty decent, I wouldn't go here for their regular menu.

I'm really sad that my experience there wasn't an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, because God knows I felt like that's what I was experiencing.  Biggest rule for anyone eating anything: IF YOUR BODY WANTS IT OUT IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT. First you meet the horribly unprofessional and ill-mannered hosts/hostesses. That is, after you go seek them out to put you on a list, where the hell are they anyway?! They don't greet anyone! Wtf! Most of the time they were arguing with other hosts and servers. ARGUING LOUDLY. And there's no way to distinguish who is waiting, who has their name on a list, or anything because you're supposed to wait for your seat in the tiny doorway, so people are coming in asking us, ""How do we get on the list?"" Dear god. Then, as they are calling names, half of the people on there have already left anyway. But instead of going down the list, they cross the name off and walk away. Wtf? Empty tables, 15 people waiting. So we finally get seated and meet the only nice person there, our waitress. But then the food comes (not quickly). Oh noooooo... First, you have to pay for bread, which is the first indication of a horrible restaurant. The ""garlic parmesan breadsticks"" have NO seasoning, let alone cheese on them. I got better breadsticks at the pizza place outside of my high school. Then, my lemonade comes and it is MINUTE MAID. Ewww!! My date and I both ordered burgers. These weren't just ordinary burgers. THIS WAS BURGER SOUP! WOW. The bottom of the bun on both of our burgers were COMPLETELY soaked through, sopping pieces of bun that ripped as soon as we picked it up for the first bite.  Now, I'm not one of those people who is afraid of any kind of food, or afraid of certain textures or anything. And I DON'T have a queasy stomach. I eat Mexican and Indian food with no problem. So believe me when I say this food was DISGUSTING. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I tried to eat it, I really did especially because they charge $12 for a damn burger. But less than halfway through, I had to go to the bathroom because my stomach wanted it out out out! Looking in the toilet I found that my shit looked just like the sopping mess that was on my plate. Lol. So instead of going back to my table, I had to get straight out the door of this terrible place.

Julie L.,"Fremont, CA",0,33,28,1.0,11/6/2014,"This review is about Edgar for his unwelcoming and poor service.  I arrived at this location for a quick late night meal. It was 2 hours before closing on a weekday, it was not busy at all. The place itself was clean and the environment was welcoming.  My friend and I were immediately seated and given menus by Edgar. He returned shortly with our orders of water and while we were still obviously looking at our menus, rushed us by asking what we wanted. After politely explaining to him that more time was needed, he left us alone for a full 15 minutes (yes I timed this) and by the time he returned I was starving. Again, keep in mind that this was not a busy night. I ordered my sirloin medium and was returned with a well-done tough piece of meat that had obviously been sitting out. The reasons I have for this is that 1) the jack Daniels burger my friend ordered was beyond soggy, room temperature, and falling apart when he received his and 2) my sirloin was room temperature and felt like it had just been warmed up. The lack of quick execution of our meal was no big deal to me at first because hey, everyone has a bad day right? Again, Edgar proved his incompetence by leaving us alone for the rest of the night, walking past our table several times and being unaware that we were ready for our check. After we finally received the bill did I see any pleasantries from this gentleman, which made me feel as if he were happy we were finally leaving or happy that he was about to receive his tip.  It takes a lot to bother me and I still provided  Edgar with a tip that I soon realized should not have been given to him at all.  As my friend and I walked to our car, I looked through a window on the left side of the restaurants main entrance. Who do I see? Edgar with his hand inappropriately groping his girlfriends ass while watching the basketball game. He may have been on his break or off work, but displaying this conduct out in the open where customers can assume the worst is unprofessional. Images of his hands touching my food made me cringe. For crying out loud, have you no shame Edgar? Is this behavior okay for you to present to young children who may walk by at any second? Is this the reason why your service was terrible and had a lack of speed? This is what made me upset and prompted me to write a review. Edgar is an embarrassment to this restaurant, so much that I would never think to revisit this place or any other tgi Friday's restaurants. Usually one person doesn't make me hate a place because that seems unfair, but it makes me so angry to know that this man is still hired and allowed to tarnish a restaurants reputation.

We only got 2 plates (though we could've had unlimited plates) of them because they were so hard to eat. Our friend's Jack Daniel's burger wasn't cooked enough to her taste (she asked for medium-well, I believe) so she only ate about half of it. My parmesan-crusted chicken was stiff and dry. The mac and cheese was okay, so I ate that, but I was pretty weirded out by the ""fresh tomato and mozzarella salad."" I didn't think it would literally be little cherry tomatos and globs of mozzarella cheese (looked like they had used the cold insides of their mozzarella sticks). I think Boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich and he was disappointed by the lack of chicken in the sandwich (there was so much more bread than there was meat). I used to come here for late-night drinks and appetizers to share with groups when I was younger (see: freshly 21) and they seemed alright then. Maybe I've just grown up and my tastes have changed. We had the gift card, so we had to use it. But I don't think I'll be back unless it's on someone else's dime (and even then I'd probably think about it pretty hard first).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=180

After another few minutes of waiting did my husband finally got up to the bar tender to ask him if anyone was going to attend to us. Five minutes later bar tender comes to us and attempted to get our order . That's when we had to tell him..we haven't even receive menu. Now by that time we were regretting coming to the restaurant. Sitting there watching more people arriving and NO waiter/ waitress to be seen was a RED FLAG. If it was a well managed place manager would have the right planning to put better staffing on a very busy evening. It's called MANAGEMENT 101 !! This place needs immediate management training. When a waiter finally came to our table to take our order, he looked like it was his first day on the job. After another 30 minutes more of waiting our food finally came, without utensils available. My husband had to track down the waiter to give us utensils. Food came which really just made us so regretful of why we drove to this place.  The food we ordered was to have vegetables that looked and tasted like a child was told to take it out of the bag and throw it on the plate . Absolute NO taste and flavor.

I used to eat some of their items with pleasure as at that time maybe Friday's paid their workers better. After my experience today, it's safe to assume their quality has plummeted.  Came in here right after a movie for lunch, and boy, I thought working fast food was crap but to express it on your face is worse. Walked in to two workers, maybe hosts (?) and I felt bad for how empty her face was. It was a Sunday morning, so I guess the church rush ended but to have no life in your eyes when you greet customers? Damn. Must really hate working here.  Anyway, me and the boyfriend were seated promptly and greeted enthusiastically by Tatiana. She was sweet. Placed our drink orders and waited no more than 10 mins. Mind you, it was dead. We got the drinks and I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. I tasted ice slush and strawberry flavorings.  Yeesh. I'm not one to complain; I grin and bear it. But either way, wow. That's bad. Boyfriend got a beer, can't review because, come on, how do you ruin what's on tap? I had the 6 oz. Sirloin, medium, cut it open and grimaced. It was like I cooked it. Clearly the chef didn't watch enough Food Network or even read his menu because medium has a pink center. I saw none of the sort. I thought it was the lighting so I took a bite. Nope, tasted well done. So much for flavor.  I had the side of cheddar mac and cheese with mashed potatoes. How could you ruin either? Taters were fine, but the mac and cheese was dry. I felt like I was eating a lunchables equivalent. Blegh.  Tatiana was attentive and with her customer service she deserves better than to represent a failing franchise.

Food took forever to arrive, around 30 minutes despite not being rush hour. I was a bit disappointed honestly. I expected food to be of somewhat decent quality, but their brocolli on my dragonfire shrimp wasn't fresh. Rice was of questionable quality too.

We decided on a flick at @ Union City and had about 45 minutes to spare before the movie. Plenty of choices within the parking lot, we didn't feel the time crunch would be an issue. Even if we missed previews....an hour to spare? not bad at all.  This was during the week, not a weekend but still. It was 9ish pm & we first attempted to eat at pasta pomodoro, closed. Sushi place, closed. Fuddruckers, closed. TGI Fridays.... seated immediately.  That's when service took a nose dive. Did not even get greeted by any servers beyond the door person seating us for a good 10 minutes. Next, the server takes our drink orders (easy enough) 2 shirley temples. Ten more min. later he comes back with ""Here's your two waters!"" My reply- Ugh. Shirley Temples?  Oh yeah (haha, sorry) be right back. The overall order consisted of salad for me with a side of blue cheese crumbles. And an appetizer of pot stickers. In my opinion, easy enough to prepare and bring out. All of this took up nearly an hours worth. Even after bringing the food, the server forgot one LAST item. The silverware, no joke. I was so impatient I had practically eaten most of my salad finger-style before proper utensils arrived.  Very poor service. Not worth the efforts of being open later. We could've found more decent food options at the movie theatre itself.  I rate this chain restaurant with 3 stars because the food/drinks were good despite poor service with a lack of focus and unmotivated staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=340

When we refused, she rolled her eyes and seat3d us right next to a large group with a child's birthday party with a lot of empty tables other places in the place. Then it took our server over 15 minutes to acknowledge us and get our drink order. We received our drinks and then our soups. Still no silverware or napkins. Had to flag our server down to get utensils. No refills on drinks. Food was decent. Not sure if I'm willing to return here. We will see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=340

I sure hope they continue to ""bend"" the happy hour times to tweak the crowd. I like the fact they have a lot of TVs and parking is not a major problem...

Eric N.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,46,,3.0,8/23/2014,"My GF and I were staying at the Holiday Inn Express which was around the corner from this place. And so we went in here not once, but twice! We went back to TGIF by default because we pretty much were convinced this place wouldnt let us down since one of the local seafood place dropped the ball on us the day before. And when we went to TGIF both times, we sat down right away and this is during dinner time during the week.  Noticed the bar was always full tho, but Im stoned cold sober now and am on the wagon so no sauce for me tonight. LOL!  We like to share, so when we order the entree's we just split it in half and get to enjoy two different entree's in one sitting.  But first of all the appetizer : TUSCAN SPINACH DIP is pretty darned good. We ordered it both times on both visits. Its yummy.  I think we might have even ordered a double for that. So on both occasions we ordered off the Jack Daniels menu. She ordered the JACK DANIEL'S® RIBS & SHRIMP and I was hungry and ordered the JACK DANIEL'S® MIXED GRILL* Hella good on both! Very tasty. My GF is from Beijing and this menu is one of her favorites when she comes stateside. Its a treat for her so she doesnt mind doubling up on it. LOL!  And for dessert, we shared the SALTED CARAMEL CAKE, that was good. The previous night we shared VANILLA BEAN CHEESECAKE Made with real vanilla beans, layered with white chocolate mousse and baked in a graham cracker crust. Topped with white chocolate shavings.  A little too sweet but washed it down with lots of water and a cup of coffee! LOL! This is a good place. Very quick service and the food gets to you quicker than the other places in that mall. Maybe the only other one is Appleby's, which I think is a notch down from this place IMO.  no complaints from us and this is from two different visits in the same week.

What I knocked 3 stars for was that I had to wait literally 45 long minutes AFTER being sat for the server to ask me if I would like to get started with a drink. After I ordered the food it took 45 minutes to get my food, which wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't already wait 45 minutes. I can also be more understanding if the restaurant was packed. This wasn't the case. It was nearly empty during happy hour (they have happy hour for a reason, to encourage more customers to come at late afternoon hours since it usually is slow). The problem was that they only had 1 server for possibly 8 tables or more. Shockingly understaffed. Also, this isn't the first time I've had terribly slow service.

The green bean fries and Jack Daniels wings are fantastic, and most of the waitresses are friendly and attentive.  The drinks vary in strength in that if you order two rum and cokes, it's entirely possible that one will be super rummy and the other will be mostly coke. If you're looking to get hammered, look elsewhere. That being said, I still like coming because of the appetizers and the drinks, and that's good enough.

Then one of the girls answered me and said 10-15 min so I said okay cool and then they went back to talking to each other so I had to ask him if I'm supposed to wait or stand in line (it's been like 5 years since I've been to TGIF) and he said I had to write my name down. And then he just fucking stood there. So I told him to put 2 under my name and THEN he went and got the damn clipboard and put my name down. So after waiting for about 20 minutes we were finally seated.  Our server was nice and quick. Not very attentive cause it was so busy but what can you expect from a TGIF, right? Needless to say after we ate we got the fuck out of there asap. But yeah, the hostesses should be the main people to set the mood in the beginning and these hostesses did a horrible job.

Dinner well that's another playing field, If you know you're going to be eating here and you're a group of more than for your best bets to avoid a wait that can go from 30 minutes to even an hour is to make reservations unless you guys are okay with taking over the bar and even than that's hard to do during happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=320

Maria K.,"Fremont, CA",5,20,,1.0,5/13/2013,"Ate here this weekend, and it was the most disappointing meal I've ever had. We waited 40 minutes for nachos. When they arrived, they were cold, and the jalapenos were NOT on the side, like we had requested. 30 seconds later all of our food arrived. My husband got the wrong side, and his ribs were only warm. My crunchy parm crusted chicken had sat under the heat lamp and was neither crunchy nor hot. Room temp is being kind. The sauce on the side of tortellini was all glazed over, like it had been sitting for too long, and the tortellini was borderline cold. My daughter's mac and cheese was only just warm, and the broccoli was cold.  With an antsy one and two year old, who had been waiting for food for 40 minutes at this point, we opted to just eat it, but I complained. The server was apologetic, as was the manager, and he removed the nachos and ribs from the bill. That was nice of him, but still.... it was a waaaay disappointing meal.

Al S.,"Union City, CA",245,140,272,3.0,6/4/2012,"The food is okay.  The buy 1 get 1 makes up for it (1 star up to 3). Service,like what others have stated, is not this place's forte. We got seated promptly since we got there around 5pm, still early and not quite dinner time yet. Our waitress didn't get to our table until literally after 5 minutes later (seemed much longer than that).  By that time, we were ready to order our food, she took them promptly. At this time, there were no utensils/napkins on the table... which we saw all set up on the table across from us. Drinks showed up and so did the appetizer... still no utensils/napkins. Finally our entrees were being delivered... still no utensils/napkins, my wife asked for them.  Now at this point, I thought that our waitress would make getting the utensils her first priority... no stopping at other tables, just really quick get the utensils.  Or grab the ones from the other table for us.  It could have been a really quick fix. After waiting for a short while, she decided to grab 2 sets from the table across from us.  And then the waitress showed up with 2 sets of utensils... a little too late. After that things got better.  I'm guessing she was busy?  But still, what I see here is a lack of time/customer's management. Observing the rest of the crew, I saw many of them walked pass our table without even a slight glance and maybe only 1-2 of them were smiling. I understand that each waiter/waitress has his/her own designated tables, but they all still work for the same restaurant.  A bit better team work would've made things go much smoother.  Maybe help keep an eye out for customers who are ready to order or need something... relay it to the designated waiter/waitress.  Be eyes and ears for each other, instead of everyone for him/herself. Or maybe designate a person or two to do this 'spotting' job, engage the customers. Look and smile to all restaurant's customers, even when they are not on your designated tables.  It might seem so small and simple, but it can add a lot to the overall service impressions and atmosphere. As I stated above, the service did get better toward the end, also the reason why it's a 3-star review. People will always come for great service.  Many would even tolerate the food a bit if the service is great.  Fix the service, I can see this place getting more or updates to 4 stars (at least).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=360

MY ADVISE IS IF YOU PLAN TO USE A COUPON, DON'T COME HERE We always wanted to try eat in here and we finally did because we received coupon in mail for buy 1 entree and get 1 free with 2 orders of beverage. Perfect! After we sat down, the waitress greeted us. Then I showed her my coupon and asked if I could use it. The waitress told me ""sure you can use the coupon but you can not use it to order anything with lobster on the entree menu."" I double check the coupon but it doesn't has restriction listed for entree choice. We didn't know there is restriction and we wanted to order the entrees with lobster. I asked why we couldn't use it for lobster and the waitress told me their manager told them that but she can ask her manager see if they allow us to use it this time. After a minute, she came back after asking the manager and told us her manager said we can use it for THIS TIME ONLY .. (OK.. good)  We ordered  Appetizer: BBQ chicken flat bread $10 Entree: lobster & ribeye entree $24 Entree: lobster & ribs entree $22 Off the entree menu: we ordered a burger  $12 Drink: Gold Medalist $3.5 Drink: Another fruit drink $3.5 After placed the order the waitress told us they can only free the Burger because it free the cheapest entree out. I told her the burger isn't even from the entree menu, are you kidding me? I re-read the coupon to her that says buy 1 entree and get 1 free with 2 beverages equal or less value.  My dad got angry and asked what if we need to split the check will we get the second lobster entree free then? The waitress said yes if we don't mind doing it and she will ask her manager if that is OK. After a minute she came back and said she got it taken care of. (OK again.. fine) We finished our meal and I asked for check. The waitress really brought us two bills to free our 2nd lobster entree. I tried to pay with credit card but I waited 10 minutes the waitress never came back to pickup the check. After 10 minutes someone looks like their manager in red shirt asked if this is ready. I said yes and asked if I could use same credit card to pay for both bills. Then he misunderstood me and thought I asked if I wanted to them to put two bills back into one. So he did it for me.. OK so he just put two bills back into one after the waitress tried so hard with her ideas to stop us from using the coupon and not letting us order the entree that has lobster.... TGIF Management, if you don't want your customer to use your coupon then don't send me the freaking coupon in mail. You want your customer feel embarrassing for using a coupon then you did it.

My mom's dish was overcooked. Her steak was too dry hard to chew. Her lobster tail was way over cooked by a couple of minutes. It looked like a goofball not a lobster tail.

Couldn't finish the food; I guess it's lucky we weren't that hungry.

The appetizer deals used to be half off, now they're all $6, which, for many of their apps is only a dollar or so off the regular price.  The drinks are ok, and the appetizers are the usual chain restaurant fare: wings, potato skins, mozzarella sticks, etc. Their potstickers are pretty good, but they're a little pricey. Holly always takes great care of us, when we get another server its sort of hit or miss. You kind of get the feeling that they know we work in a restaurant as well, so they know they're gonna get a good tip. Holly, however, is a total sweetheart and has always given us great service.

Over 10$ for a cheeseburger and a tiny side of fries? Not worth it. I had the sirlion and shrimp which was over 20 bucks and the meat was really red even though I asked for well. I did have a blue raspberry slush which was actually pretty good though lol. Fourth problem# Okay please note that I came here with my grandpa and not my brother or sister. So my grandpa doesn't really know everything and can be a little you know...at times. SO: We used the gift card and had to pay an extra 15 bucks. Was that the problem? No it wasn't.

It wasn't full and there was no wait. Took 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, another ten to get our drinks, and our food came out half an hour. That's almost an hour to see food from time of arrival. Bf ordered steak medium rare and it came out well done. We asked for it to be replaced and it took another 20 minutes. I won't go into details about what I ordered, but my Mac and cheese side was f$&@!n penne with bread crumbs!!! There were more pieces of penne noodles than shreds of cheese! The cheese was basically sprinkled on to penne noodles and melted... So once the cheese was gone it was plain old penne noodles again, what the fork?!

The atmosphere is definitely more active and service a bit better than Chili's. And there was a bit more options here.   Maybe it is a Wednesday but, there were no real crowds and it was very safe without any rowdy bar crowds. To me however, I liked the Chili's steak dinner (2 for $20) than here (3 for $20) because Chili's steak was more tender and the mash potato more flavorful (maybe it was the bacon). However the dessert and service made up for that gap. I believe there eagerness for the grill marks or the way the steak was cut, ruined the steak for me. If you are really picky about the steak, at this price I would recommend Chili's (the nachos and guacamole was also good). However the flexibility and offerings is your thing, then this is a better place for the price.

Been going to this place for more than 10 years and were decently satisfied with employees and food/drinks quality. However, we were turned into scapegoats thru conspiracy by the security guard and hostess' on our last visit. All seemed to be fine on this last night that we were there, the bar was closing around 2am, we were asked to close our tab, which we did and paid with a debit card. Meaning that funds had to be available for the damn thing to even go thru. FYI - about 15 mins before we paid and left, a group of patrons (also a party of 4) was asked to leave the restaurant as they were arguing and being rowdy in the restaurant. The security guard quickly escorted them out and let them go. Tons of people saw them leaving. 2 mins after we exited the parking lot of TGI's, Union City police stopped us for not paying our bill. We're like: ""is this a joke?"", but apparently it wasn't, the security guard and maybe other staff gave the cops our license plate number as the guilty party, when clearly everyone saw the other group of 4 create a ruckus and leave. We explained to the police exactly what happened, but management was unable to clarify this for almost 1 - 1.5 hours, we got home @ 4am that morning. How hard is it for cops to call a restaurant and ask the manager to go thru the last 5 - 10 merchant copies of signed receipts and clear up the matter. My inclination: the security guard was trying to make sure his friends could get as far away as possible while cops could harass an innocent party. SO, just in case your planning to be disrupted by rowdy crowds, harassed by cops and be conspired on by security guards employed here, feel free !

During happy hour, they card at the door, so I guess you can't grab a food unless you're 21+.  Since it's so crowded, it's hard to find seats at the bar. Fortunately, they have a lot of tables off to the side considered part of the ""bar"" for happy hr. Seating isn't the big problem, it's getting served. After the first round of drinks came out, one of my friends was still missing his. 15 min later, we asked again about it and the waitress tried to play it off like it was still coming out, but it was clear she had forgotten to put his in. A crown&sour can't take 20 more min to make than margaritas! Our food and later rounds of drinks also took a long time to come out. It got to the point where my friend ordered 2 drinks right after receiving one, knowing he wouldn't actually get them until he was way past done with the first. In the end, that didn't even work and we just hauled our asses to the bar to order them for ourselves.  BUT I do have to give 1 star for $5 large margaritas, $4.50 spinach dip for which they'll gladly give you more chips, and green bean fries, buffalo wings, potato skins, etc. all for hella cheap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=400

We ordered the cheeseburger sliders, which were ok.  We also ordered the Jack Daniel's burgers, very well done, no pink, and they came out like a lump of coal.  Our buns were toasted, and obviously kind of old because they were hard.   Mango Margarita didn't taste like alcohol at all, BUT the worst part of this is the HORRIBLE service.  Our food took forever, it was gross, and the waiter hardly came to our table.  We saw him high fiving his friends, we saw him on his cell texting someone, we saw him walking around goofing off with his fellow waiters.  He was doing all except serving his tables.   We waited for the check for so long, when he brought it out they charged us the appetizer twice.

The last time I came here our server, I forget her name(probably because I didnt HEAR her name), was suuper quiet. I could barely tell if she was mumbling to herself or if she was talking to us. Friday's should invest in getting that girl a microphone or something! We settled on eating the 2 for $20 which INCLUDES dessert and is a pretty great deal because some other restaurants 2 for $20 deal doesnt include dessert.

Neha H.,"San Francisco, CA",313,72,12,1.0,6/29/2013,"One word. AWFUL. Awful food, Awful Service. I came here on Friday with a few friends to enjoy a dinner out. By the end of the meal, the service was so horrible and we were so hungry, we were almost not even friends anymore lol. When we arrived, we put our name down on the waitlist. I stood outside the front doors for us to get called. About 15 minutes later, I walked in again to check on our table, the host gave me mad attitude and told me he had already called our table and next time I should stand closer to the restaurant. Excuse me? I was right outside the front door, maybe you should use your legs and go check. Wtf? I actually mentioned out loud that I had been right outside, and he gave me a death stare. Then he proceeds to seat us at the back most table next to the bathrooms and the kitchen. Again, WTF? Next, our waiter was ""on a break"" so we got another waitress taking our order. She put in our order (we ordered nachos) and almost 40 minutes later, they came... that too COLD. I ordered a drink, which she never brought, and then after I asked our REAL waiter to cancel my drink, it magically had already been made and given to me. Then we ordered a salad, again, it took another 30 minutes for a simple SALAD to arrive. We didn't even eat it, we had to box it up and leave. Our waiter was not at all apologetic, and he barely came by to check on us. He pretty much ignored us everytime he went to the kitchen... hmm maybe it had something to do with the crappy seating. Overall, I am not cool with this place. I don't like spending my money on a useless meal with terrible service. I could cook better food and be happy eating in. This place is a terrible chain, and for the price of their food, I expect some better service. Needless to say, I will never be going back here again.

Our server was sweet and took our order when we were ready.  It took (again) for-ev-er for us to get our food.  The place was pretty empty so I have no idea why it too so long.  All of us ordered sandwiches as well, so I was slowly becoming annoyed again by having to wait so long. My club sandwich was good and I ordered for a few buck extra sweet potato fries (yum).  Imagine my disappointment when I hardly got any.  I mean the fries were so scarce you could see most of the plate.  I really was (again) annoyed that I paid extra for this side only to hardly get any.   So the theme of my visit is obviously ""annoyed"".  My visit reminded me (once again) why I detest chains and the lack of decent food and portions.  At least we had a very sweet waitress that gave us good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=400

We were sitting at the table waiting for someone to take our order, no one bothered to stop by. We kept waiting. Finally someone came and took our order, appetizers came out within 10 minutes, after we finished, no one came and cleared the table. Entrees took over 30 minutes to come out. Once the entrees came out, my colleague had requested sweet potato fries instead of french fries, they gave her french fries. After being able to get the attention of the waiter, he brought out a dinky plate of sweet potato fries. Really now? The portion of the sweet potatoes was half of the portion of the french fries. Such a disappointment. The tables near us had the same experience. The waitress/waiters were not constant, we had other waitresses and waiters from other sections of the place to serve us.

So we had to complain yet again, and it took them 15-20 minutes longer to get the food out. My salmon was stiff and flavorless., and didn't even come with pecans...

That's how ridiculous it was. They seem to have a sufficient number of staff on hand, but for whatever reason they like to flock around the servers station playing grab ass or whatever it is back there that makes customer service not a priority. My most recent visit was just last week. They had some construction work taking place in the doorway, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was just standing there. There was no host ready to seat us (even though it was obvious to them we were there), and nearly vacant but for a few people @ the bar. Once seated, we were completely ignored once again.

No one in the front to greet and  take you to your seats. Took about 3-5 minutes. Got seated and I discreetly asked if they do something special for bdays and told her that we're celebrating two. She smiled and said she'll take care of it. There were only four of us so it wasn't like we're keeping her busy. Got the drinks and appetizer just fine. Took a little longer for the entrees. Food was just okay...nothing special. But the service was clearly lacking when you can't even get drink/water refills. Server came around once, probably after we'd each taken a bite or two to check on us. That was the last time. We sat around a long time after we'd all finished our meals, when someone else (not our server) asked about dessert. I guess our server totally forgot about the bday celebrants. I asked for a couple of minutes to peruse the dessert menu. Kids picked out what they wanted, then our original server came around 15 minutes later. We ordered dessert (still didn't jog her memory and I didn't bother mentioning it 'coz it would take away the element of surprise) & asked for water refills. Before she could move too far away, she asked a colleague if she could get us water. The other's reply was ""I've got people in the front"" & turned her back. 30 minutes later, we finally got our dessert--a couple of ice cream-filled oreos served on a plate with choc/caramel drizzle. 30 minutes!!! At this point I got up to take a look around. Sure...other patrons but definitely not crowded, especially when you see 4-5 servers standing around in the soda station chatting...but no one could be bothered to give us water refills!  We picked this place 'coz the kids said that out of all the places in Union Landing, we haven't gone back to this one in a while-- at least a couple of years. Now we all remember why.

The TV's they had the last time I was in there were literally there when the place opened in 2000 and they were up above the bar yet behind all the glasses so you couldn't see the anyway. Now it is completely modernized. Looked to be 10-12 flat screens so you could see them from wherever you were sitting and they also got rid of the top part of the bar so it's completely wide open so you can see what's happening everywhere in the restaurant. Kinda like that. This place seems to attract many attractive woman for some reason so I like to be able to scope out the whole scene. As far as food/drink aspect the food used to be terrible but I had a couple different items and was pleasantly surprised. Grilled Chicken Nachos were tasty although a little cold in the middle. Bacon Cheeseburger with Sweet Potato Fries was much better than expected. And as with any Fridays there is a full bar but I tend to stick with beer so the fact that it was ice cold was a major plus. All in all nice upgrade and a much better experience than previous visits. Can already tell this is probably going to be my new fall back spot when I just wanna get out for a bite to eat and a drink or 2.

Seated off to the side and menu in hand, my server got my drink quickly and she NEVER let my drinks get low the entire time I was there (either my Coke or water). I ordered their babyback ribs and got two side-orders (fries and cole-slaw). Fries were not hot and the cole-slaw was neither cold nor crispy.  Forget the side-orders for a moment since they were only a scoop of them. The Ribs were top notch and the meat easily came off the bones.  It came with a small cup of extra BBQ sauce but I used it because I liked the sauce and not because it was dry. This is something I want to eat all the time.  Ribs tasted like ribs covered in sauce, not like sauce with meat flavoring.  For dessert, I had their red-velvet cake with ice cream (I can NOT believe it was that many calories!)  I was disappointed since the cake tasted dry (ice cream made it better).  But honestly, do yourself a favor and just order a dessert and ignore the calorie count printed on the menus!  I think reading that might have made me give an excuse not to give their cake a higher score! I don't know how loud this place gets during major sporting events but I am told it does get loud at times.

Another thing is, there are seating booths on the left side of the happy hour section when you enter. We sat there and ordered happy hour appetizers, and when the waiter came he said that if we sit in the booths we don't get happy hour deals. So basically if we moved 2 feet and sat at the bar area and ordered food, we can get the happy hour appetizers but not if we sit in the booths.  Sort of uh ridiculous ?

Though it's not my favorite joint for a gourmet dinner, it's become a ""default"" restaurant when my friends and I don't want to go out of our way for a meal and just need a quick fix.  Lately, it seems like their menu is constantly changing, but I like the new dishes and the ""right portions, right price"" section. I hate, and I mean absolutely HATE, wasting food or having leftovers to take home. It just doesn't taste the same after being nuked and half the time, I don't even bother eating my leftovers because I tend to forget about it. That leads to perfectly good food being tossed away, which makes my heart break a little every time.....ANYWHOO, smaller dishes for a cheaper price = thumbs up in my book! My favorite dishes are chicken tenders, sizzling chicken & shrimp (the cheese is delish!), and the stuffed potato skins. What really wins me over are the mashed potatoes. I don't know what they do, but I can never get enough of their mashed potatoes. Mango mojitos here are excellent as well as the AMFs - knocked me out during one of my birthday celebrations. The bartenders are well trained. Happy hour is cool: Mon-Fri 4-7pm, all day Sun. Plenty of booths by the bar and even an outdoor patio to enjoy cheap drinks and cheap appetizers.

We wanted something a little more substantial than the fast food places that litter 880, and it seemed all the restaurants around Union Landing were closed.  Reluctantly, we settled on the TGI Fridays. It was past midnight, but the place was bustling and still serving a full menu.  I had the petite sirloin with sweet potato fries and broccoli.  The steak had that delicious ""just off the charcoal grill"" flavor, and the sides were surprisingly fresh and tasty.   A plate of onion rings were done just right- crunchy and juicy.   It all hit the spot.  A good satisfying meal, friendly service, a festive atmosphere (ok, a bit noisy, but it was Saturday night), for around $30 for two.   This place is definitely now on my short list of places to go for a late dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=440

Ritti S.,"Union City, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/3/2011,"Hello. So here it goes.  Me and my cousin had a long days work and decided to go out to this TGIF and watch the NBA finals while having a few beers. After the game was finished we went out to the patio area to have a cigarette. Having come here for years for the food and drinks and not having a problem with smoking in the outside patio area, tonight we learned of the poor management of this business.  The two of us stepped outside for just a little over one minute, lit up our cigarettes and within seconds we noticed a guy dressed in jeans and an oversized black jacket addressing two other guys to exit the patio using the emergency exit because they were smoking in the patio area. Immideatly after, he rushed towered me and my cousin and said ""you guys are going have to put that out, there's no smoking."" Respecting his request (and assuming he was security even though he was dressed like any other joy in the streets) we put out our cigarettes on the ground and headed inside the restaurant where we had our personal belongings such as our jackets, cell phones, car keys, and the food and drinks that we hadn't even touched. Before we could reach for the door handle, Jermey Codwell (the name of the unprofessional security guard), demanded that we pick up the cigarette butt and throw it away outside the patio. Now this is were the situation gets complicated. As soon as I reached to picked my cigarette butt, this guy starts pushing me and my cousin while saying that we are being kicked out and that we are trespassing by being on the premisis.  Had we gotten a warning first in a professional manner I would not be wasting my time addressing this issue. I have been enjoying the service and hospitality of this business for years, but the caliber of disrespect I exprienced tonight will not be forgotten and swept under the rug.  I will do everything in my ability to get security guard Jermey Codwell FIRED! The time of this incident was a few minutes before 10PM, 07-03-2011 After being kicked out the patio area, the same security guard would not let us in to get our belonging from the table where we were sitting at, on top of that threading us that he was calling the police because we were trespassing. We then luckily came about a second security guard who escorted one of us to get our stuff. Immidetly after stepping outside, I got the establishments phone number, called it and asked for the manager who simply went by the name of ""Trisha"" (which I think is also unprofessional). Trisha came out and asked what was the problem. The two of us filled her in of the situation. After that the guard was given a moment to speak, who claimed he didn't lay a hand on either one of us. Trisha the manager chose to believe her security guard and turned her back towered us without an apology or even some sympathy that we were long time customers who were highly disrespected.  All in all, if I don't get this uneducated power crazed security guard Jermey, and the evening manager who doesn't care about the customer satisfaction of the business she is running FIRED, then please do interact with these individuals and see for yourself if they are well deserving of their positions at this establishment.  thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=460

Zechariah H.,"San Jose, CA",43,5,,2.0,3/18/2014,"So,  I was here for my friends birthday and just hoping to get a good meal because I was starving especially since I just got off work and didnt eat anything.First i want to say is that the service was decent, no complaints here, the servers were polite and took down my order quickly. Other than that the vibe is good, not too loud and not too quiet. The only problem, that I can say is the prices for the food did not match what they gave me. Its like they were stingy on the food or something because I ordered a burger and I thought it would be at least decent size because it was bit on the pricey side. The burger was pretty small compared to the picture and they gave me like a size small fries that looked like it was from Mc Donalds. Honestly, I would have gone to applebees because at least there portions are decent size, enough to actually get me full. I only gave it that extra star because of the service and the setting, other than that the food, is not worth spending money over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=460

I was pleasantly surprised to see that each food had its caloric value in parentheses next to its title. I chose the Dragonfire Chicken -Under 500 calories!  I must comment the meal's picture and the actual food were spot on. I enjoyed the meal presentation and the quality and quantity on the plate was filling and flavorful. I was not left feeling hungry or under-satisfied . The chicken was grilled and moist throughout, and the pineapple pico de gallo was a sweet addition to the dish. The rice was light and fluffy and complimented the complete dish. The service was good, however, the lighting in the restaurant kept flickering on and off, and seemed too dim for my dining tastes.

They add on the steak. Told them to box that up too.

Got the bill and it wasn't even on there. He asked for the manager. Manager came and listened. Said that our server was a trainee. If he's a trainee why wasn't he following a more experienced server?

And good thing because the food was deeelicious! As the promotion goes, you add Woody on facebook and if enough people add him then everyone gets a coupon for a free burger.  I'm not really much of a burger person, but free is free. We got there and I half expected the waitress to roll her eyes and avoid us for most of the meal, but she was attentive and friendly the entire time. We also ordered a cup of soup and a soda and a beer. The clam chowder was amazing. It was one of the best I've had to be honest. The burger was nothing short of spectacular, it was savory and yummy and so much better than I had ever dreamed it could be.  If it had not been for this burger, then I never would have come here, and now I'm hooked. I will probably be here again and again.  My only complaint bringing it from 5 stars to 4 stars is the family at the table next to us, The had a child with a portable dvd player and we could clearly hear the dvd playing.

It is similar to Chili's (a little on the higher end though), Texas Roadhouse, and Tony Romas as far as food, service, and affordability.  Last night was an anomaly as we waiting 1.5 hours from the time we ordered, to the time we received our meals. Although the waitress was honest about her mistake (she had apparently forgotten to put in the main order after the initial appetizer and drink order was processed), we continued to wait nearly 25 minutes. Not 5 minutes after telling the manager to forget the food and to just give me a bill for the drinks and appetizers, we received our food.  I was impressed that as soon as the food was delivered, the manager came over and comped us for everything but the drinks. I wished I had gotten his name as I would have called the TGI Fridays corporate office to tell them that this is how business should operate. Mistakes will be made - but you can make up for them if you are honest and are willing to take the hit for the long-term gain. Because of this managers and waitresses honesty and free meal, I definitely will be back.

Katrina G.,"Union City, CA",31,32,,3.0,6/23/2011,"This review is strictly on some of their food, service, and on TUESDAY's LADIES NIGHT HH. First of all, I did not know that Tuesdays were Happy Hour all night for the ladies... on top of their regular happy hour times. Most of the appetizers are $6 and their ""ultimate"" drinks are $5 - I tend to get margaritas and mojitos... both relatively good and worth the amount. Food - if you order a sandwich or burger and like your side to be hefty... do not get the side salad, it's pretty tiny and not worth it. The California sandwich itself was pretty good, but would have preferred more turkey over the amount of ham that was in it. The Jack Daniels chicken appetizer is pretty good too for an app. I've also had the sizzling chicken and cheese entree which is really good! - I'm also a big cheese fan so I can't complain when something savory has cheese on it. It comes with 2 chicken breasts with some mixed in grilled bell peppers and onions plus 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. I managed to finish half of the entree.  Service - the service is inconsistent, but it's almost as if the service in the bar area is MUCH BETTER than if you're sitting in the regular dining area. The servers and bartenders are just more personable so it's easier to get what you want from them. When we eat in the regular dining area, the server messed up our order, triple charged us for our food, and did NOT attempt to apologize for it. One time, my friend ordered a chicken entree and she mistook it for a chicken and shrimp entree.. we brought it to her attention in a very chill manner and she told my friend to ""scoop off the shrimp onto the side dish plate"" and that she would bring out the chicken on another side dish plate - WTH?! That was extremely unprofessional and, not to mention, TACKY. I mean, I know this isn't a fancy restaurant, but sheesh. This is completely different in the bar area - we are always checked on, asked if we need anything else, etc. - and, no, this has nothing to do with drinks consumed.

Anna F.,"Union City, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/15/2012,"With all the restaurants in the Union Landing mall, you'd think the competition would make restaurants step up.  Not so, apparently. I ordered two meals ""to go"" (chicken picata pasta).  The person taking the phone order seemed to have better things to do -- and had to ask more than once what I wanted.  She repeated it back, finally, --and hung up.  No reference (like name or phone number), no estimate of when the order would be ready -- just hung up! I immediately got in my car and went to pick up the order.  After being asked to wait when I told her I had called in my order (and she asked what I had ordered), the young woman came back after a while and told me they didn't have it.  Apparently, it was a ""new item"" on the menu (I had looked at the menu on-line) and they didn't ""stock"" yet. Come on, people.  First of all, Friday's needs to get their act together.  Second of all, Friday's needs to make sure their people are trained so they know what's on the menu and what's not.  I should have been told on the phone that they didn't have that dish.  But probably MOST important, their people should be trained to act a little more professionally.  Hanging up on customers without so much as a good-bye isn't very hospitable at all -- isn't that what the restaurant business is about? Final result:  I said, ""Never mind..."" and went and ordered take-out from Applebee's.  At least the server there was pleasant and seemed to know what I was talking about when I ordered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=500

This booth was located in front of the door. So the whole time we were experience the wind blowing in our direction. It was a really cold night too might I mention.  Trying to disregard this awful seating and wind, we looked over the menu. Now, I've been to TGI fridays a few times. I've never been satisfied but this time was the worse. The menu LOOKS like it has tasty entrees to offer all at a great price ($7-13). YEAH RIGHT. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan over penne pasta. It was pretty awful. I got like 20 pieces of penne pasta (no lie) and over fried greasy chicken. DISGUSTING. The other entrees my friends got were pepper crusted porkchop or something with mash potatoes and onion rings. They got ONE porkchop, two small scoops of mash potatoes (it tasted like the ones from the powder mix), and 3 onion rings. YES, THREE PIECES.  Our server was OKAY. She was nice but didn't refill my water at all. Not even once. She was quite slow. The only thing that was good was the AMF. Adios TGI Fridays.  NEVER coming back. NEVER.

Due to the scant vegetarian options on the menu, I ordered potato skins and a basket of garlic breadsticks.  I guess they removed veggie burgers from the menu several years ago because vegetarians only like salads, or so they believe.  Anyway, the kitchen still managed to mess up my order and scattered bacon bits throughout.  Sigh, they had to redo my order, so I munched on some generic breadsticks dipped in ranch.  Olive Garden offers better garlic breadsticks for FREE.  Anyway, the potato skins eventually arrive and taste horrible.  Even though the menu describes the skins as ""cheezy"", there is barely any cheese on top.  What a generic and plastic-tasting meal.  The prices are also pretty expensive for chain standards even though their food is on par with Denny's. For dessert, I ordered a peanut butter pie, which honestly tasted good.  However, it was so small and not worth the $5.79 price tag.  It seemed half the size of a Cheesecake Factory slice.  Meanwhile, the utensils seemed dirty.  If I could rate this place with zero stars, I would.  However, I will grant the server one star because we was nice and helpful.  I cannot blame him for the poor quality of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=480

Luckily there was one nearby.  It looked like there was a wait, but we walked in and waited to be seated for about 30 seconds when the manager comes to the front and asks us if we had been helped. I said no and we got seated right away. I asked about happy hour and he said Sunday is happy hour specials all day long! Half off all appetizers except platters and seafood. If I wasn't headed back home I definitely would have ordered a drink. We ordered a basket of fries for $1.50, a bowl of clam chowder, garlic parmesan wings, chicken quesadilla, and nacho grande. Came out to $23! Great deal for tons of food. Our server was friendly and fast. It was really busy, but he kept checking in on us. Will be checking out our TGIF in Elk Grove soon.

Finally, when we did get a servers attention at our table, she was clearly very annoyed with us and was actually kind of rude.

When are they going to update this place? The TV's are circa early 1990's and have blurry pictures. Spring on a dozen big screen LCD's, guys!!  We had to wait for 10 minutes for a table, even though the place was 2/3rds filled at 5p on this Friday. Not enough servers probably. Got seated at our booth, which was very plush and comfy, but the table was very icky sticky.  Strawberry milkshake for the wife was lame. Tasted like powdered strawberry milk. Just sent it back and got a soda instead. Potato skins were good but not enough sour cream. Small sirloin steak was bland and the Mac & Cheese was crap.  Chicken w/strawberries salad was the best part of the meal.  The 40-something waitress was out of it and had the bill wrong and was blaming another worker for it. ""I knew he wouldn't take the shake off."" Well if you knew that, why didn't you take care of it yourself?  So this place hasn't changed on the bad service and mediocre food.

Dawn L.,"Millbrae, CA",295,209,21,1.0,2/26/2009,"In the same genre of bland, suburban strip mall fare, TGIFriday's is no better than their competitor (Chili's) at Union Landing. I recently came back because I got a couple of coupons in the mail for buy one entree, get one entree free. Prior to that, I was on a TGIFriday boycott because their food and service sucked so bad. (Seriously, I think the last time I came here was about 2 years ago!)  So I went with two other moms and their strollers and this last time was terrific. We had a server with a kick-ass name - LaLa - who was attentive, genuinely nice, and had great timing. We split the Jack Daniel's appetizer combo, the Jack Daniel's ribs, some chicken melt dish, and the green bean fries. The appetizer combo was actually pretty good. The sauce made everything taste great, though the deep-fried shrimp was a bit cold. The ribs were ok - a bit charred but again, the dipping sauce made it ok. The chicken cheese melt dish seemed to be pretty good, though I only got a couple bites of it. Finally, the green bean fries were their usual consistently good. Time before last was a semi-disaster. Our server was an older woman who basically disappeared between seating us, taking our order, and giving us our food. I felt sorry for the server in the adjacent section because we ended up asking her for everything. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was AWFUL. Charred meat and nothing else. The best part was during the bill - we had to ask the other server for it and our server couldn't figure out how to chop it on three credit cards. (WTH??? There's a button that automatically divides it for you!!!) So she ended up jacking our charges but we didn't want her to have to run everything again and screw up once more so we just whipped out our calculator and figured it out ourselves. Awful. Given a choice, I don't think I would choose to come back to TGIFriday's on my own. In the meantime, those coupons save me some money so I guess I'll just settle for some mediocre food and service. *sigh* What has my food life come to???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=480

I understand that it's loud so that those waiting outside to be seated can also listen; however, why  not have it slightly lower? It was a big hard to have a conversation because the music was really loud.  IAs for customer service, it could improve.

Right when it came out I wasn't please already. The plating presentation was off and it didn't even too appetizing. Had my first bite into the pasta and the texture of the angel pasta was soo gooey. It was wayy over cooked and just really nasty. The sauce, well I don't know how to describe it, but it was not good at all. Then the desserts came and the cake I liked.

When we went there again, we were told dogs were not allowed in the patio. We had specifically made our way to Friday's because we were with our dog that day, and they changed their policy on us.  In fact the person at the door did not know the answer about whether they allowed dogs, and went to ask his manager. I saw her hesitate when he asked her, then she decided that the answer was no.

I cannot say enough about the horrible service at this location. I used to frequent this particular location with my friends but the service has taken a nose dive in the past couple of years. For the most part, the waiters are much nicer to larger parties and tend to ignore the smaller ones, and sometimes seem very rude if you approach them for something first rather than them coming to your table.  Other TGIFridays may have great customer service but this one does NOT. Stay away and pick another restaurant in the area. The wait in line is definitely not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=560
Brandon D.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,39,,3.0,1/7/2007,"I have gone here several times when they've forgotten to charge me for a soda or dessert.  And it tends to happen when I go with just one other person.  I guess they tend to be nicer when they think you're there on a date.  My experience has actually been the opposite of what Jay P. wrote.  I have had good service in smaller groups.  There were times when I've seen lots of people waiting outside and I come up and get a table instantly.  But that doesn't always happen. I usually get the Flat Iron Steak or something from the Jack Daniel's menu.  For dessert I normally get the Brownie Obsession, although one time they messed it up and put way too much fudge sauce.  I love their long island iced teas!  They're a bit pricey but you get A LOT; you get a good buzz before you even finish it.  In general the food is decent, but I go here for the atmosphere more than the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=560

They do not care about customer service, they are obviously locals who work there to be ""cool"" & hang out with friends. I've been to this place a few times, sometimes it was for drinks others to eat. Each time I left annoyed to hell. Why i went back I don't know, but I know now I am never ever going back. The management here needs to all be FIRED !! Just one example of the bar service, after waiting FOREVER to get one of the PUNK bartenders to take my order he pours my drink (margarita on rocks) & its really really weak & sugary, I mean all mixer & no liquor. My friend tastes it & agrees, I kindly notify the bartender & he appears to get really annoyed then rudely snags the drink out of my hand, spilling some of it on the counter AND my hand, then proceeds to pour liquor down the straw before passing it back to me with a serious ""Eff you"" attitude. I stood there dumbfounded not believing what I just witnessed & debating whether i should smack this jerk to hell. I try to tell him that was not cool & I wanted to speak to a manager, he tells me ""no problem"", walks away but no manager ever comes. I was so pissed I drank the drink & left without paying for it or leaving a tip. SCREW THESE GUYS!!! Sorry, but there was NO excuse for that!!! Another time I went to eat with a few friends. The waiter was a classic case of someone who has no business being in the customer / food service industry cuz he speaks way too much ghetto. WTF !!! WHO HIRES THESE PEOPLE???

TGIF's is supposed to have some good food & I want to say they still do but the parolees cooking in the back here absolutely destroy the dishes. Beware eating here! It will NOT look anything like what you see on the menu, sh*t I bet the menu itself probably tastes better than the food itself. These people screwed up the appetizers & got really testy when we complained. I sincerely hope they shut this dump down, there is NOTHING good about this place!!!

My friend got the Cobb salad.  Eh, it's pretty difficult to screw up that one, so I suppose it sufficed. Their beer on tap selection is superb, which I took advantage of by ordering a Guinness.  I wouldn't order anything besides appetizers (we had the parm-crusted quesidilla, which was pretty good) and drinks. If you want a good meal, go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=520

Scot B.,"Bend, OR",22,110,1,3.0,7/28/2008,"Went here after a party at iFly around the corner. 2 adults, 7 teenagers. Waitress was friendly and responsive, and the food was OK. It didn't all come out together, which made some cold and others overdone. My biggest complaint...they're too nice...to the point of nausea. Look...it's OK if you want to open the door and great me, but then the person right behind you did the same thing...then the person right behind her. Then the waitress...then the manager...then the hostess again. Give me a break. I must have been there right after ""politeness training"" or something, but they apparently forgot the part about ""everything in moderation.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=520
Thuyvi M.,"Hayward, CA",714,853,632,4.0,11/8/2009,I've had TGIF back in Arizona and really dont remember how it was.  We decided to try something different tonight so we gave it a try.  There was about a 5 minute wait for a Saturday night which wasnt bad.  Our server Mindy was very nice and friendly.  She got our drink orders in right away as we sat down and then proceeded to take our orders but since we weren't ready she came back in a enough time for us not to wait. She also refilled our drinks without having to ask.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp griddle thing which was hella bomb but the griddle thing was too hot so my food wasn't cooling down to eat i kept burning myself.  I must say that their broccoli and cheese soup was really delicious.  I also ordered garlic breadsticks but they were good.  It just tasted like plain bread and the bottom breadsticks were all soggy and wet from either water still in the bowl it came in or some liquid spilled in it. So when I took a bite into it it tasted like soup or chemically.  I also tried some of the jack daniels chicken which was very flavorful. Prices were a little expensive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=520

Tiffany L.,"San Jose, CA",25,77,8,2.0,5/30/2008,"I like TGI Fridays because its a cheap place to get drunk, espeically during their happy hours.  They currently have a promotion where its unlimited long island ice teas and margaritas for 5 dollars.   So i came here today with my boyfriend and his two sisters.  We were seated 20 minutes later and our waitress was nice.  We ordered our drinks and food and everything is okay.  Then when our food comes out, I wanted another thing of sour cream for my potato skins because the small ass cup that they gave us was surely not enough.  So she happily brings us another and yea, we start eating.  My bf had the Jack Daniels ribs and steak and it was okay.  It was a little salty for me but my boyfriend lovessss salty food so he wasnt complaining.   Then the bill comes, everything looks right except they charged us for FREAKIN SOUR CREAM!!!  WHAT THE DU MA?!  ITS SOUR CREAM, JUST GIVE IT TO US FOR FREE!!!  It's not the .59 cent charge that im mad about, its the fact that they would charge us .59 cents without saying anything because its just SOUR CREAM!!  Like 1 tablespoon of it.    I think the next time i come back, will only be for margaritas and long island ice teas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=520

Shelley S.,"Oakland, CA",42,81,,3.0,7/30/2007,I used to hate Friday's food.  Then some years ago they changed the menu or something and I started to like it.  So we hit up this place on a Sunday afternoon....They weren't all that busy...we were told 5-10 minutes for a booth.  Well they didn't have a list at the time and the host that we originally talked to was off somewhere so another guy came to seat people and of course he skipped over us.  When i got his attention to this he found a table for us right away.  I was highly disappointed with everything except my Pina Colada and our appetizers.  I had the Cajun chick and Shrimp pasta.  The sauce was supposed to be alfredo so a little think.  Well mine was runny and just didn't look very appetizing. I ate what i could stand but gave up pretty quickly.  Jenn C barely touched hers.  So I'm back to not liking their food and  I think we've resolved to only order appetizers and drinks from here on out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=520

R B.,"San Francisco, CA",41,177,,1.0,8/20/2008,"Last I heard these guys no longer require 15 pieces of flair (ala Office Space).  Yes, it's been that long since I've visited this place.  I've gone here a handful of times during their flair days and each time was a horrendous experience.  Rude waiters that can care less if you need a napkin or an extra plate.  They might as well rename this franchise Dick's Last Resort.  The nail that sealed the coffin for me was when I had dinner with a friend, and we got waited on by this cat who was just too cool for school, being a little more casual than you'd want out of your waiter.  To make a long story shot, rather than carrying our meals on a tray like he should have, he decided to balance all our plates with just his arms.  Sure enough. he dropped our entire order in front of our table.  What did this guy do?  He laughed without any apology.  The only thing this place has going for them is that they serve alcohol.  If you eat here, you'll need to drink lots of it to digest their horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=600

Mahmoud Y.,"Union City, CA",25,6,1,1.0,9/16/2009,"I live in Union City for about 7 years now, I love going out to eat at Union Landing, lots of great places to eat at. But the TGI Fridays here in Union City is horrible. It wasn't busy at all. So we were greeted and then seated. We waited over 10 minutes till the waiter came and asked to order. Ok took the order, and I was telling everyone, ""it shouldn't take no more than I say 15 minutes."" It was like dead, no one there. Ok well that 15 minute mark had passed and still no food. Well 30 minutes passed and finally the food arrives, but out waiter didn't give it to us, instead it was some guy from the kitchen, which was odd, because it wasn't busy. Ok as we ate, the waiter did NOT check up on us to see how was everything. By the way, their food isn't all that great. You don't get even a side with your order, like a salad or soup like most restaurants offer for free with your meal, and also always they serve it COLD! Ok so he pops up from no where and gives me a refill and said, ""here's your Coke"" But as soon I took a sip of it, it was root beer (blah) I got mad a little, BUT gave my sister a refill without her asking or him asking for one. And her drink isn't a free-refill. Ok we all had finished up our meals, and waited for at least 20 minutes to ask for the check! After getting the check, we waited another 10 minutes for him to pick up our check. What was funny was, we haven't left the Fridays and the bust boy came to clean our table (I was like WTF) all this trouble was for nothing, I did not tip the guy for which he and his staff was horrible.

I'm outta here!! Thank You for Dining with Us!!""  OH MY GOD!!  I work in retail I kow how badly I start wanting to go home as the time ticks closer and closer to quitting time, but GEEEZ!!! oh and our booth kinds smelt like piss....bathroom's were kinda dirty with toilet paper everywhere.   Normally service and food wise Friday's is a solid 3 stars for service and food...but I'm losing faith...now all I have to do is convince my husband to never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-union-city?start=600
