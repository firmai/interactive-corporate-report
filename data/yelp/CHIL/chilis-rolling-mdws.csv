Albert K.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,188,55,4.0,3/24/2009,"Came here after a long day at IKEA.  So glad we did.   Of course got the queso and plenty of margaritas.  I had the bottomless soup and salad, which was a great deal at $6.49.  We were seated immediately and our server (George) was very nice and quick. One of the best Chili's I've been to.  The one downtown is a tourist deathtrap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2456,3000,4.0,11/30/2006,"I'd stayed away from Chili's after a few terrible encounters in different cities and I always felt they needed a significant change. Its been two years away from Chili's. Got a coupon in the mail about the ribs, they'd added some new sauces, grilling features, the coupon was awesome - 1/2 slab with sides, salad and dessert for $9.95! There were a few bbq sauce options, I had the 1/2 and 1/2, they were very tasty and filling.  We sat in the bar area.  Service on a Saturday evening was quick and efficient, very surprised.  I wish I remembered the name of the server, I sent a  Chili's a thank you card for that dude, that was the best service I'd had at Chili's, EVER. They've got some good alc deals at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Carmella B.,"Chicago, IL",27,136,118,4.0,1/31/2009,Came here for the special  $9.99 mix and match and I was impressed its basically finger food but I  did as a meal instead of appitizer.. The waiter seth was great I felt a little bad for him cause table across from us was giving him a hard time but service was fine for us. And we made up for her cheap tip im sure she left him...!!!!! Choose the  southwest e rolls on one of the 3 choices you get and really didnt care for those to much . Had to much beans in them but the buffalo boneless were good and the little chicken sandwiches were also good. You can also call ahead and put you name on the list if your on you way which I think is pretty cool to cut the time down for a 25mnt drive and then only have to wait less time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Magge M.,"Glendale Heights, IL",4,9,,1.0,8/6/2011,"I ordered the chicken crispers and they were slimy, and looked like fried rats. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich and he said it was dry, and had little taste. The margaritas were good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Jennifer C.,"Maple Grove, MN",208,483,44,4.0,2/24/2011,"Went in for the 2 for $20.  For our app we got the half order of Texas fries, piping hot and yummy.  For my entree I got the quesadilla explosion salad which was very good and my hubby got the chipotle chicken crispers which were tasty as well.  I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Kamila L.,"Park Ridge, IL",44,196,21,4.0,2/13/2010,"I love this place simply because they are so accommodating to their customers. It doesn't matter if there are 2 of us or 7 of us because there's no difference in service. The drinks were up quick, my 5 yr old had coloring books to keep him entertained right away, the food was out quickly and all hot. Our server was polite and attentive - I've been coming to this Chili's for years now and it never disappoints. Oh, and I absolutely love the fact they open the door for you when coming in / going out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Dee W.,"Evanston, IL",187,1570,1299,3.0,7/7/2007,"First of all, service was great and if I could rate based on service, this place would get 5 stars - our hostess was great and our server was really awesome - always checking up on us and quick and friendly. I know that this is a chain and it's probably one of my favorite chains - with their daily drink specials.  C'mon, margaritas and house wine for only $3 for a decent glass of it?  And beers for only $2 - great!  And their apps are usually delish with the Awesome Blossom - that oily greasy delicious concoction of onions and that yummy dipping sauce. Their food is pretty consistently good - however, what brought this place down to three stars was my steak fajitas last time.  My red bell peppers that were grilled still had the produce sticker on it!  Unfortunately, I didn't find that out until I had already scarfed down 90% of my food and it made me a little nauseated thinking that I may have also inhaled some more ink and other stuff.  So, when later, I got sick that same night, I'm still blaming that little produce sticker and wanting to give Chili's a one star review, but I'm reasonable and will compromise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Danielle P.,"Wood Dale, IL",6,14,1,4.0,9/19/2010,Service was good and fast! Food was good and I had the most perfectly blended strawberry daquri!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Rob S.,"Schaumburg, IL",13,52,8,5.0,11/27/2005,"Chili's food is consistant, since it is a chain restaurant, so i won't comment about it.  What i really appreciate is the short wait times for tables and the polite staff.   Even when busy, I don't think i've ever not been served in a timely fashion.  IF you're looking for a place to go after shopping at Woodfield, drive an extra 3 minutes and go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
Justin G.,"San Diego, CA",74,635,,4.0,7/28/2007,"I've been to this Chili's several times and it is pretty good.  The service has been excellent, even on those occasions I've had servers in training, and the food has always been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rolling-mdws
