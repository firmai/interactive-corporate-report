Bryan P.,"Muscle Shoals, AL",1,12,9,5.0,2/5/2016,After having a bad experience here a while back we were given gift cards for here. This go around has been very enjoyable and the food superb.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Chris W.,"Helena, AL",604,406,1621,2.0,1/9/2017,"I think there is a reason I haven't been to an Applebee's in a number of years. The boneless wings on the happy hour special were pretty good. Freshly prepared, with good flavor and surprisingly an ample portion. That's where the positive aspect of the experience ends. Extremely slow service despite the restaurant being maybe 25% occupied all night. The advertised pitcher special was unavailable because according to the server there were no pitchers to fill. The beer selection extremely limited as well... bud light, ultra, miller lite, hi life and a seasonal Sam Adams. I elected for the Sam Adams after a flat ultra.  I ordered a burger special. My choice allegedly had a fried egg and hash browns atop the burger that was cooked with bacon and onion.  What I received was the greasiest burger imaginable with scrambled eggs on top. I didn't even attempt a bite as its appearance was so unappealing. It was as though grease was ladled on top of the mess inside of the bun. A manager asked if I wanted them to remake the burger and I declined. I further said I would wait till after the game and get food elsewhere, to which she gave an approving nod. Had this place not been walking distance to my hotel I wouldn't have ever come in. I came to out of convenience with coworkers to watch the National Championship game. Options in town are limited for a sports bar atmosphere. The convenience was most definitely not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Bud E.,"Clifton Park, NY",8,1,,2.0,10/4/2017,"The service was ok ,the food was was small portion and the wings where old and burnt , will not return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Ricki H.,"Evergreen, CO",0,15,,1.0,11/10/2016,"Garbage food. Service was great, but the ribs were dry and tasteless. Likely from a Sysco or other food supplier. Our server was friendly and helpful and was nice to my grandchildren. The restaurant's bathrooms needed a little cleaning, albeit I've seen worse. The hostess was friendly but the food...bleh. I wouldn't order a salad here or even chips and salsa.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Susan C.,"Clifton, TN",0,4,1,5.0,11/1/2016,"My husband and I went to Applebee's to celebrate both our birthdays on October 30th. We were greeted at the door, promptly welcomed by the hostess and immediately seated. Our waitress was knowledgeable and very pleasant. We were undecided on our selection so she gave us time to decide. The meal was served shortly. My husband loved his steak and roasted veggies. I ordered the Thai Salad. Everything was wonderful. Customer service was impeccable. Not just some of the service but all. We even had a waitress that was cleaning a table ask that we wait so she could open the door when we were leaving. Our experience is not one that is ordinary but extraordinary. We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Buck H.,"Muscle Shoals, AL",24,85,190,4.0,1/30/2016,"Over all the food is marginal but good. The salad taste good acually really good except the lettuce is hot. This is a great place for families to go but be ready to sweat because the restraunt is very hot and all of the tables are right next to each other so you may make a friend considering,at the farthest you are 3 feet away from someone",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Sarrah S.,"Florence, AL",0,11,11,2.0,5/8/2016,"The last couple of times my husband and I have eaten here the service was extremely slow. The one time, they weren't even busy. The servers are very friendly, just slow. The food is good sometimes and not so good other times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Paige H.,"Florence, AL",2,5,1,1.0,4/19/2015,"Service is below par, food is... edible. Skip this chain and opt for a local restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Bob V.,"Florence, AL",69,23,20,3.0,11/6/2014,"we had dinner here tonight,  Don't order the chicken Fettuccini, they just don't know how to cook Italian.  It looked and tasted like milk and noodles. service was good, Tonisha was our server and she did a very good job. I got the impression the cook didn't give a damn.  The manager did not charge us for this part of the meal but didn't come to the table.  This is the first time I had a bad meal here and I hope it's the last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Greg R.,"Birmingham, AL",40,212,,3.0,2/18/2014,I was in town during training over the weekend.   This place was really busy and on a wait.  I was alone and there was a wait so I ate at the bar.  The servers was nice and engaging.  I ordered the steak and shrimp.  The steak was a bit tough.  I did also order the wedge salad.  It was huge!  I wished it had came with tomatoes as most wedge salads do but it was still plenty to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Lisa C.,"Lomita, CA",1,14,1,5.0,5/15/2014,Love Applebee's! Me and my husband went on a Sunday night and sat at the bar. The bartender was absolutely wonderful and made great drinks! Service was fantastic! We had appetizers the won Tacos are to die for! The mini sliders were cooked just right so juicy and flavorful! Very friendly environment! Can't wait to go back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Teia D.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,7,,2.0,7/12/2014,We have been here several times and the service is always lacking and they are frequently out of items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Clint W.,"Florence, AL",0,45,,2.0,10/25/2011,"What can I say. Experience is quite mixed. First time I eat here, my wife's meal was inedible. The entire portion was left on the plate the entire time. The waiter wasn't interested even when she mentioned how horrible it was. Although my T-Bone steak was good, there's no excuse for sticking a customer with a bad meal, which is what they did. When a waiter takes away an uneaten meal, there should have been a clue. Never was she offered any other options, just a ticket that reflected full price. The 2nd. time I eat here, it was out of respect for a friend who loved the place. Again, not impressed. That's 2 times in nearly 8 years. No dice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
Jack L.,"Chattanooga, TN",6,11,,5.0,5/19/2008,"Great environment, excellent wait and management staff.  Meal was excellent, and you can't beat their prices during Happy Hour!  $0.99 Miller Light Drafts!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-florence-7
