The place was half empty and we stood waiting for a hostess for too long I thought and finally what looked like a manager came out to seat us. The service was less than great for sure..our waitress really didn't care and forgot some items. Someone who wasn't even in her serving area came to check on us..so that was nice of him! Albeit it was late at night when we went, but still c'mon if you are working for tips, you should at least try to earn them right?!

My wings were ice cold and my friend ordered a medium rare Sirloin and got a well done steak that you could eat in two bites on a plate that had an amount of broccoli that could feed the vegan nation. All while no manager or anybody seemed to care. The only reason I tipped the waiter a dollar was because he looked like JP from grandmas boy and who've made for some good robot laughs.

I've never really had a bad experience up until this last time. The server was someone who we had never seen before. And she looked dis-engaged the entire time we were there. She was waiting on a lot of tables in the bar, and everytime she would pick up dirty plates she would heavily slam them into the dirty bucket area. It was very obnoxious. It also took forever to get our check, we had to flag her down and ask for it. We were there about 2 hours.  I will return because i like the other servers who usually see us and free chips and salsa on thursday evenings is hard to pass up on!

There's the menu favorites that always taste great, and that consistency is appreciated, however the water is consistently gross. Pretty much every drink I've ordered is. I wonder if they've ever cleaned their ice machine or fountain drink thingy. They always taste like either soap, mildew, or flat sweet soda. Yuck.

When I first entered there was no one to greet us which is odd so we waited for 10 minutes until the bartender seen us and called the young man to come and Brett us. He seats us we notice there is only one person at a booth in the entire restaurant. We get seated and wait for someone to notify our waiter that we were there. She comes up and she greets us. We told her to give us just a few minutes as in we will find out quickly what we wanted to order and she comes back literally 15-20 minutes later. I was being as patient as I could when my husband peaked over and noticed she was chatting with 4 associates. He makes eye contact and she comes over. She finally take our order and I had to flag her back because the kios for our chilis points didn't have a battery. She takes about 10 minutes to get that. We waited 30-45 minutes as she sat and talked once again for our food for a restaurant that was almost empty. Then when she does bring our food out she drops the main things that go with our meal and the top of our food was hot like it was sitting under a lamp and the middle was cold. I told my husband to spot the to go plates and we will take our food home. I was through. She asked to do the check and I specifically told her that I would do it from the kios she ignores that and when I go to pay it's gone off the screen. At this point I'm about to blow. I called the restaurant thinking it was that location and asked for the manager to come to the table. Poor Sara at the kingwood location was so sweet but it wasn't the one I was located at. The waiter comes back to the table and I told her I was waiting on Sarah and she said ""if she told you that was her name she lied to you."" She laid the bill on the table we paid and I got the hell out out there before I went completely off. If she new I was waiting on a manager why did she go and grab hers?! I called as soon as I got home to find out I had called the wrong store at first and I ended speaking to Emanuel the manager on duty. He was so understand and so kind hearted I give kudos to him just getting there and trying to get it back in shape. Emanuel needs more customer friendly team members that come to serve customers. We weren't being difficult and we didn't ask for nothing more then for the waiter to service us. It wasn't a busy night so her service should've been on point. Emanuel offered for us to go back and he'd make it right but I just can't. I would've have rather been refunded my money or sent a gift card to eat at the kingwood location where we are loyal customers and know we are going to always be taken care of.

3,Che P.,"DuPont, WA",3,41,6.0,1.0,2017-05-04,"This is by far the worst Chili's I've ever been to.  I went in yesterday and ordered a burger to go.  When I was handed my burger, the to go box was open inside the bag and the bar tender didn't even care.  He was like ""Here's your food dude"".  Just a few minutes before that, I saw him do the most disgusting thing ever.  He had a ragged bandaid on his thumb.  As he was bringing some guy's plate out of the back his ragged bandaid thumb was literally in this guy's plate.  He hands the guy the plate, says ""Oh man that looks great bro"", then licks his thumb.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Back to my dish......my burger was cold, bread was hard, and fries were on the brink of being stale.  Clearly my order had been done for a while and had just sat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
2,Cornelius S.,"Houston, TX",141,197,225.0,1.0,2017-05-04,I will never go again.  This is the 2nd time in 2 visits that I have waited a hour to get my food.  5 I repeat 5 families came after me.  They got they food and left. Wow.  Ask the manage what was going on?  They saw they were crowded.  This is a ongoing thing.  I will never go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
1,Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",305,37,149.0,2.0,2017-05-16,"We visited the bar around 3pm on a Monday afternoon. It wasn't too many people at 1st but it got a little crowded the closer it got to 4p. The bartender was BEYOND BUSY. He was working the entire bar area including the tables. Food was alright, lack luster. We ordered sizzling fajitas that weren't sizzling & a burger order medium that arrived well done so that about sums that up.  Oh! Service could've been better had he had help from the other women who was on her phone most of the time. He repeatedly forgot things that we asked for but I understand. He was swamped with no one to throw him a life jacket. Poor thing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
10,Patricia W.,"Houston, TX",0,34,,1.0,2017-05-28,"There is no way this restaurant deserves any star but what can I do?  A very long story but suffice to say, Chili's Corporate Office will be contacted.  A manager by the name of Nestor has no business dealing with customers...rude, unprofessional and patronizing.  When the employees working there tell me what a jerk he is, I'm not going to contradict them.  Because he messed up a to go order he informed me that when I called to place the order I should have talked to him.  Uh...up until 30 seconds ago I didn't know you existed.  And when I told him I was calling corporate he scurried back into the kitchen telling the staff I was going to call corporate about him.  I got the funny feeling this will not be the first time corporate has gotten a call concerning Nestor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
5,Sarah H.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,24,6.0,1.0,2017-05-30,"Second time here, slower than the first which I didn't think was possible. Staff is pretty terrible; poor customer service, slow, kind of rude. Food is typical restaurant chain food. Place is dirty, sticky menus and the ""ziosk"" thing is disgusting (food stuck to it, sticky). They don't give you napkins, or take your menus; bizarre. Keep driving and don't waste your time or money here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble,1.32,1.32,1.32,,1.32
0,Jessica J.,"Spring, TX",0,30,109.0,4.0,2017-07-24,Came here for tequila day with some co workers. Sat in the bar area. Place was not packed at all around 4pm on a Monday. The service was good. The margaritas were good & cheap for tequila day! Good place to meet up for a drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble,1.44,1.44,1.44,,1.44
