Megan D.,"Chatsworth, CA",452,20,14,4.0,3/26/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory for their Sweet Corncake Tamales and Avocado Egg rolls (especially the sauce it comes with). It's one of those restaurants I turn to when I can't really decide where to go since they have a variety of dishes to choose from, but I always gravitate towards the Fettucini Alfredo, Steak Diane, or the Avocado Egg rolls. The flavor is always consistent and the service is always so quick and accurate. I also order their strawberry lemonade, it's so refreshing but it can be a bit too sweet, so I just add a little more water. I highly recommend their chocolate mousse cheesecake or the keylime one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20
John F.,"Chandler, AZ",1,38,2,1.0,3/6/2017,Once again my fellow yelpers have let me down. Every time I have been to a cheesecake factory the food is bland and lacking in taste.  On top of that the server is extremely slow when I am looking across at many empty tables.  I am done with this restaurant. How anyone can give 5 stars shows me they must eat TV dinners alot.  I have been to this chain and gotten the same results!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20

Karin M.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",311,8,1,1.0,2/12/2017,Avocado egg rolls were good but i ordered a Chinese chicken salad to go and i get home and realize that they didn't give me any dressing to go as well. Yes awesome cool expensive lettuce but im not about to eat it with no dressing and now they are closed and im mad that i have no food to eat for my midnight snack so YEA im leaving Oklahoma tomorow and will never get my stupid dressing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20

Nadine S.,"Calgary, Canada",2,32,48,2.0,7/19/2015,"Partner and I came in just for cheesecake around 9 PM. We were seated immediately, which I've been told is unusual as it's normally very busy. Our waitress seemed very displeased upon learning that we would only be having cheesecake and continued to make her displeasure obvious throughout the rest of our visit. I ordered the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake and my partner ordered the Snickers cheesecake. Our cheesecake came about 10 minutes after we ordered. Both cheesecakes were warm - I didn't have a basis for comparison, but my partner told me that they are usually chilled. My cheesecake looked like it had melted a bit, but the other one looked fine. Both tasted very good despite the warmth. Our waitress refilled our drinks very frequently, but barely spoke a word. About two bites into our cheesecake, she dropped off our bill and said ""no rush"" in a tone that sounded quite agitated. Her negative demeanour put a damper on the experience, as we felt quite rushed after that. Overall, not a great experience. My partner assures me that his previous experiences have been excellent, but I don't think I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20
Jamie B.,"Chandler, AZ",296,405,728,4.0,8/29/2015,You can never go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  I was happy to see this close to my hotel and that it has late hours.  Both the food and service were great.  We dined here twice while we were in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20

I explained this place as ""they probably have over 50+ different offerings of American, Italian, and Asian food. And a bunch of different types of cheesecake."" Cons: took her 20 minutes to look over menu and pick something to eat. They stopped serving my go to order of shrimp BLT. Got the spicy Cajun pasta instead. It was decent. Friend got some kind of salad.  It was OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20
A. J.,"Flagstaff, AZ",4,301,5,5.0,6/15/2017,"So, why give a chain restaurant 5 stars? We had some excellent service! We wanted to so happy hour apps and that is usually at the bar,but we had a 2 year old and an infant with us. The hostess found a way to make it work. Then the two year old decided to pitch a two year old fit. A waitress stopped back, acting oblivious to the noise, and asked how old the child was. She said she has a two year old and finds a plate of chopped fruit settles her kid down and could she bring us some? She was so nonjudgemental and kind, and it worked like a charm. The Cuban rolls were great as was the pear gorgonzola flat bread. The crab balls were overdone. All the cheesecakes were great. But the kindness of the waitress (she wasn't even assigned to us) was the best part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20
Christy B.,"Siloam Springs, AR",0,35,1,4.0,11/22/2016,The service was slow! When we arrived it was before the dinner rush so we expected more attention but this was not the case.

John B.,"Jenks, OK",0,8,,1.0,12/10/2016,Place looks nice but what a joke. I had a hamburger which I tasted ok until I bit into the gristle. Burger came with no condiments 5 minutes wait. The ketchup came in a 1/2 dollar size dish 3/8 inch deep. Just enough for the hamburger. So 5 more minutes for more ketchup for fries this time even smaller 8 fries later 5 more minutes for more ketchup. Ask to look at cheesecake and they gave us a menu to share. Wife went to get another 20 minutes later taking cheesecake to go sick if this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20
Sol R.,"Tulsa, OK",0,7,2,1.0,11/16/2016,Went there on a weekend night with my s/o we werent given an option between a booth or table. Our server checked in on us once after taking our order.

Senie S.,"Tulsa, OK",39,161,169,3.0,9/11/2014,"I go here quite a bit since it is by the mall and they have so many food options you will always find something to eat. I have been to Cheesecake Factories all over the country and this place is not anything special. I mean it is a chain restaurant, and even though they ""specialize"" in cheesecake it is still not made in house and shipped in frozen from a company for you to order. Regardless, the cheesecake is pretty good and i stop by here sometimes for just dessert.  The service here is also pretty decent- I mean they are all mostly younger kids in school working here as a part time job so you really cannot expect much. If you are looking for a place to grab food  and also has a dish for everyone this is a good place. The prices are fair and the portions are huge. I personally just never leave here after eating feeling good about what i consumed.  Don't forget they also have national cheesecake day where you get cheesecake for half off!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=20

Shelby G.,"Bentonville, AR",26,201,198,4.0,11/11/2017,"I was surprised to see that there was no wait for a Friday evening. Every other Cheesecake Factory I have been to usually has at least a 45 minute wait. In Tulsa, we walked in and were sat immediately. Service was very prompt, in fact, a little too prompt at times, with our server rushing us through our meal.  As an app, we ordered avocado egg rolls, my go-to for Cheesecake Factory. They were delicious, as usual. Our entrees came out before we finished our app and after 2 bites of dinner, our server rushed over with the cheesecake menu. She was friendly, however, and did offer several recommendations for Cheesecake.  Overall, not a bad experience, just a little rushed. Cheesecake was on point, as usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa

Jack C.,"Owasso, OK",100,125,55,5.0,8/28/2017,"So this is a chain... But.. if they messed up on the cheese cake... I would remove a star...

So once  you get passed the 20 page menu of food items...... ...... .... Pretty much everything here is really good.. My all time fave is the steak dianne... I think that's the right spelling... Oh well it is just damn good...  And the cheese cake.. My fav is the oreo.. usually get it all the time and then sit there in my sugar induced coma happy!

Bridget B.,"Broken Arrow, OK",34,55,26,4.0,9/22/2017,"It's a cheesecake factory, so it has a lot of those chain restaurant qualities that can be kind of bleh. However, as far as chain sit downs go, it is definitely one of the better ones. They have just about everything on their menu and it's always at least okay. The appetizers and dessert are the gold starts of this place. Entrees aren't stellar. I give them credit for getting me with the wine though. I'm a sucker for a refill when asked and they asked, a lot. So it is really easy to wrack up an expensive bill here if you aren't careful. Cheesecake is great, but it's not cheap. I recommend deciding what you want to eat and going somewhere cheaper because I imagine the quality isn't going to go down that much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa
Jennifer '.,"Tulsa, OK",58,84,151,4.0,9/7/2017,"On a recent beautiful day I decided to try out the patio at Cheesecake Factory. I had to be in that area of town and thought it was the perfect spot to sit outside and enjoy some sunshine.  I've always loved the inside of Cheesecake Factory, but if you haven't tried out their patio, it's worth a visit!   For years I went to CF when I was out of town as a fun special treat.  Now that we have had one in Tulsa for years I kind of forget about it unless I'm out dining on a special occasion.  Of course their cheesecake is amazing but my favorite dish there is a Cajun pasta with chicken and shrimp.  Just the right amount of spice!  Everything I've ever had at CF has been wonderful, but I'm absolutely loving their lighter menus when you don't want to be too indulgent.  On my recent patio trip I got the turkey avocado sandwich that came with a lovely side salad... all for under 590 calories.  They have a huge selection of healthier options, so remember them even when you just want something on the lighter side... and a patio.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa

Steve R.,"Tulsa, OK",135,272,1016,5.0,6/11/2016,"We were indecisive when trying to decide what we wanted for dinner so we decided on Cheesecake Factory due to the wide variety of the menu. We went in a little after 9 and got a booth without having to wait. Our server was Rayleen and she was great. She provided the quick and silent service that I always tried to provide when I was a server.  I decided to try something new and had the Fish Tacos and my Fiance had the Chicken Bellagio. Everything we ordered was cooked fresh and it was all delicious. Even the white rice served with my entree had a surprising amount of flavor. We were ridiculously stuffed but wanted to try the Salted Carmel Cheesecake, so we split a piece (who could eat a whole one anyway?). We have tried several of the various Cheesecakes before, but I have to say that the Salted Carmel might be the best. It is super rich though. Our meal was less than $50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa
Whitney P.,"Manhattan, NY",135,51,81,4.0,12/30/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain establishments. We don't have one where we live so we had to stop in while we had the chance!  I love the avocado egg rolls. Always have! They are amazing. If you love avocado, try them. They are wonderful.  I got a Raspberry lemonade to drink and it was ok. I wont order it again. It was extremely sweet and not to my liking, but I'm sure some would love it!  My husband and I got the tostada chicken salad to share and it was delicious. It was HUGE. I usually go with the bang bang chicken, but was looking for a lighter option and this certainly didn't disappoint. We really liked it, but next time I would get the dressing on the side so we could save the leftovers, because there will always be leftovers.  Last, the best part, the cheesecake. I am not a cheesecake fan, but the cookie dough cheesecake if one of my very favorite desserts. That's why I give four stars. Because I seriously LOVE it. It may be because it's basically a slice of cookie dough with bits of cheesecake, but, either way, it's wonderful. I'll always come back to CF, as long as they have the cookie dough cheesecake anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa
Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",994,1007,3062,5.0,3/15/2016,"Yes, it is a chain restaurant, but I love Cheesecake Factory. I currently don't live near one, so when I went to Tulsa for the day, my friend and I decided we must go! CUSTOMER SERVICE: The host, our waitress and the other employees we came into contact with were very friendly and helpful. Great customer service. AMBIANCE: All Cheesecake Factory's have the same decor and ambiance. I am a fan and think it is very nicely done.  FOOD: For having such a large menu, they do a good job at it. It seems that most of the time when places have such a large menu, it isn't good. However, the majority of things I have tried here (between a lot of locations) have been good. I have a few things that I stick with because I really like them, such as the salmon salad and Baja chicken tacos. This past time I ordered the Baja chicken tacos and will admit the rice and beans were different and were not good, so that is a bummer, but it has normally been good. DESSERT: This has to have their own category haha. It is The Cheesecake Factory afterall! I love a lot of the cheesecakes. Most of the chocolate, peanut butter/chocolate ones are my favorite. I also love the raspberry one and the lemon one.  I'm also a fan of their non-cheesecake desserts. I love the Linda's Fudge Cake, Black-Out Cake, Lemoncello Cream Torte, and the Strawberry Shortcake. Mmmmm I want some now! Haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa
Tanja M.,"North Charleston, SC",51,80,158,3.0,3/29/2017,You would think that after spending $30 on 3 slices of cheesecake the lady at the counter would be a little more polite. She was really rude.

John J.,"Tulsa, OK",130,161,36,3.0,7/24/2016,"I don't have anything in particular against The Cheesecake Factory, but I do think that it's extremely overrated. This restaurant is located on the outer ring around the parking lot at Woodland Hills Mall. It's typically very crowded and the seating is nothing special - quite a few tables have booth on one side and chairs on the other. We were very close to the table next to us and didn't really care to hear every word of their conversation or their children screaming. That being said, the food tastes very, very good. You can order a lot of different foods because it's an extensive menu and I've yet to eat something I didn't like. However, most of the food is exceptionally bad for you so I feel like it's cheating in a sense (give me some butter, sugar, and huge portions and I can make you something good, too). This establishment just seems bad for society. It's generally overpriced and I'm kind of surprised people consider this to be a fancy or nice restaurant - again, it's OK but you can find much better food in Tulsa for a better price. In closing, this restaurant is fine but there are many better options. The food and service are very good, but this isn't a particularly special dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa

My cocktail was one of the prettiest drinks I'd ever seen decorated with a pineapple slice and a strawberry.  We had the fried cheese as an appetizer. It came out in little squares and was adequate for two people.  I ordered the ""skinny"" salmon and veggies which was a Great substitute to the higher calorie menu!

I really love their veggie pasta. I think it's called Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. Their cheesecakes are, of course, delicious.

Good mashed potatoes, broccoli was steamed just right. I really like the bread. Big portions mean at least one meal of leftovers at home.  The cons: Far too many items on the menu. Seriously, less than a quarter of that would be preferable, I think the quality would be higher.  There is an ""original"" (plain) cheesecake, and there is a ""fresh strawberry"" cheesecake. The strawberries are glazed on that one (ew). They wanted to charge me more than a couple dollars to sub fresh (non-glazed) berries for the glazed ones. Nope. That's dumb. Kinda soured the experience for me. We spent $67 (before tip) on dinner for two people, and they couldn't put un-glazed berries on dessert? Service was about a 7/10.

By far the best chain steak I've had in a long time, and coming from the Cheesecake Factory who would have thunk. The staple strawberry cheesecake was bursting with flavor as would be expected.

Amanda S.,"Tulsa, OK",88,150,166,4.0,3/15/2014,"It's hard to find fault with a place that has a novel for a menu - unless it's one of those places that has 1,000 menu items and does all of them poorly. The Cheesecake Factory does a nice job of having a variety of menu items and does them well - even the pasta is cooked acceptably.   As far as the Cheesecake...I am not sure I've ever had it. Famous for their crazily caloric portions, I'm not sure how one leaves room for desert at this establishment. They all look good and there is an amazing variety.  Maybe everyone orders off the ""skinny"" menu and saves room that way? I give props to them for creating a menu of lighter, healthier options, but honestly I didn't look at that menu. I don't go to an establishment like this to eat baked chicken or steamed fish. Did I mention the portions are enormous? The crab wontons are delicious and easily enough for a table of four.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is quite yummy - parmesan breaded chicken, spicy creamy sauce, and bow tie pasta with peppers, what's not to like? Get ready for a to go box and lunch the next day! Items like the chicken tacos are also yummy...honestly, there are so many items on this menu you'd have to be a hardcore regular to try them all.  One of these days, I'm going to get a cheesecake to go, just so I can feel like I had the whole experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=40

Ted S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",497,177,140,4.0,12/31/2014,You know what you're going to get when you come to a Cheesecake Factory. The menu is vast and the quality is level across the board. I can't remember ever ordering a meal here that I didn't enjoy. I'm recently in a depression since they removed the Ahi Tuna Roll from the menu. I had a soul connection with that appetizer..

Serena T.,"Tulsa, OK",4,19,,4.0,4/16/2015,"I had pretty low expectations for this place, but it was actually pretty good. I've had bad experiences at so many non fast food restaurant chains so I try to keep my expectations in check. The wait time was insane, definitely make a reservation. Avoid the weekend if you can.  The service was good, our waiter was attentive and helpful despite how packed the place was. The chicken parmesan was delicious and the portions were generous.  The main meal was good, but the cheesecake was the best part. So good! I recommend the s'mores cheesecake.  All in all, don't expect a fancy gourmet meal at the Cheesecake Factory and you will enjoy it.

I got the shrimp and chicken gumbo with white rice, the flavor was good if you could get past the huge chunks of fake tasting rehydrated peppers. My wife ordered the fish tacos with black and cilantro rice. The black beans tasted as if they were straight from a can and were also quite cold, and the rice was clumped together like it had been sitting all day, also cold.

It is so large that when we were telling each other about entrees we had to reference it with a page number.

Because we knew we wanted dessert we passed on the appetizer and settled for the Cuban and Italian Sandwiches. Both were awesome.  We ordered the sweet potatoe fries and they came out hot and delicious. We splurged and each had a slice of cheescake. My wife ordered the chocolate variety (can't remember exactly which one) and it was so rich! I wanted the Key Lime but the waiter returned and said it was frozen and not available. Sad.

I find myself wanting to try something different on their menu but I keep going back to the same thing! Their sirloin is very juicy and tender..Their loaded mashed potatoes is delicious, and you get two types of breads upon your entire visit, one is sourdough and the other is wheat bread. If you haven't tried their fried macaroni balls then you should definitely ask for them. They are quite large and you get 4 on a plate with an excellent type of marinara sauce. It's not a cheap restaurant at all. My fiance & I both get the same thing (sirloin steak, mashed potatoes, and the macaroni appetizer and our bill is usually $60 (without tip) and if we both get 1 slice of cheesecake each then it runs around $70-$80 Reason i'm rating this a 4 star is because i am a fan of this restaurant, their food is amazing and the staff is always nice and the overall appearance of the place is nice and clean. The 5th star it's lacking is the price, there's not a lot of decent places that have great food and service quite like the cheesecake factory, but it's hard to go when your on a tight budget. They do have outdoor seating that usually isn't packed like it is inside.

Shannon B.,"Phoenix, AZ",179,274,252,2.0,7/6/2012,"If you have a large group and some picky eaters with you, Cheesecake Factory has everything!  I've been to several CFs and am not really a fan of their non-specialty menu. I feel like if a restaurant wants to do something really great, it will narrow down its options, but that's just my opinion.   Do NOT order salad at CF! They are totally worthless and not worth the $9-10 or whatever the cost is. I don't know why I don't remember this each time. If you order any type of salad, it appears huge...it's mostly filled with maybe 3-4 cups of iceberg/some romaine lettuce. Whatever the salad was advertised as (i.e. roasted veg, chicken, etc), that particular topping might be in the quantity of 1/8 to 1/4 cup. So you're paying for iceberg lettuce.   My mom ordered some chicken tacos from their SkinnyLicious (or whatever it's called) menu and enjoyed them.  Besides my crappy salad that was maybe 100 calories and did not fill me up, I ordered an egg, tomato and English muffin. The eggs appeared to be powdered eggs (that odd yellow color), but I could be wrong. The tomato was surprisingly good for a chain restaurant and muffin just OK.  Everything I've eaten here on this visit and others is just OK.  I've ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls wasn't all that impressed. IMO, the cheesecake is too waxy and I prefer homemade.

Dustin E.,"Tulsa, OK",130,183,531,4.0,3/23/2010,"This is definitely one of Tulsa's better dining establishments. The food is almost always delicious, and the portions are huge, so you have leftovers for lunch the next day. The mini corn dogs and corn fritters are great appetizers, both fried, both satisfying with light breading. I recently tried the Cajun jambalaya pasta for the first time, and I was very happy with it. The sauce had a little heat, but not too spicy. The veggies really complimented the dish, and the shrimp was the best part. If you're going for dessert, you should try the red velvet cheesecake with a cup of coffee. That's my favorite anyway. Their coffee is especially delicious, as they have the proper equipment for espresso and other barista specialties. The Sunday Brunch menu is also a real treat. Give it try if you get a chance. I recommend the breakfast monte cristo, lemon pancakes or crab hash. Some draw backs are the menu is HUGE. So much so, you'll find yourself picking out five or six things you could order. I also don't like that they take your food to the back to box it up to go. I don't know. I'm sure it's fine, I just like boxing my own food. Sometimes our services has been less than desirable. It just depends, but that can be said for any restaurant.  The seating can be a little weird, as they like to seat couples on a bench in between two families of four.

It just so happens, the food is not terrible, it's pretty darn good. I usually steer clear of chain restaurants and I know this is one that gets a lot of criticism from foodies, but I just love it. It's always super busy, they have a novel for a menu and the servers dress in all white and wear ties. It's easy to criticize what looks like an overrated restaurant. First of all, there is always a wait. I went on a Saturday at 5pm and still had to wait, but it was only for 10 minutes. The wait is worth it though. The huge menu can be overwhelming for some. If I came here more often I would venture out and try new things, but I usually stick to my favorites-pasta or chicken. The crispy chicken costeletta is one of my faves! Crispy chicken with a lemon butter sauce served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It's a huge portion too. You can definitely take home half of it for another meal. My favorite appetizer is the chicken samosas. They have a large variety of small plates and appetizers. I plan on trying a few next time instead of one entree.  Now for the cheesecake. The pumpkin cheesecake is back for the season. It is amazing! It's creamy and spicy and the whipped cream on top is the perfect finish. I have to say I've never had a bad piece of cheesecake there. The white chocolate raspberry is delicious and fruity, but the Hershey's Chocolate Bar is one of the best. I can't eat a whole slice by myself because it is so rich, but it's nice to share with someone. My husband and I usually get a slice each and share. Now I'm craving cheesecake for lunch.

Christina B.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,105,1,4.0,6/2/2011,"We don't have one of these in nyc, so I always go when I am on vacation.  I almost always get the same things--either the Cajun Chicken Jambalaya or the Crusted Chicken Romano, and of course, I split a slice of cheesecake (usually picking whatever the special is).  I love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=100
Tatiana D.,"Palmdale, CA",24,85,4,4.0,1/29/2009,"See, here's how I see CCF. There was one in Pasadena,CA so whenever I took the drive over the bridge from Glendale, I would walk down Colorado to window shop and check  things out. Night outings would show me a crowded lobby of the CCF there. A table would take at least a 50 minute wait. So when I visited last, my dear friend and I wanted to dine here and due to the wait, we instead dined at Louise's across the way. So, the wait has never been an issue (except the last time, I was 5 months pregnant with son #2 and I was hungry!). Also, the wait has never been news to me. If you want to go on a Friday night date night and want to eat here, you have to be prepared for a wait or go early.  Now, onto the food.... delicious. The only thing is there is so much on the menu, it is hard to decided waht to order. But once you do, it is awesome. I haven't had anything bad here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=100
Cheryl P.,"Fresno, CA",0,7,,4.0,5/20/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is just what it is food wise, but what made my time there tonight was the service.  Richie our server was so friendly and accommodating, despite numerous special requests from my ""high maintenance"" co-workers.  In fact one of the ""skinny"" drinks was returned because it tasted funny and Jacob, the manager, came over, talked to my co-worker to get what she wanted, just as she wanted it.  Both Richie and Jacob made this a great dining experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=100
Rebecca F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",163,79,40,3.0,1/2/2009,"The food is awesome. Seriously- five star food. But... I have to take into account everything else, so three stars it is.  The place is HUGE. Too big. I know it's nice to be able to get a table more quickly, but the tables are so close together you might as well pull up a chair at the table next to you. It's weird. You feel like whispering because it seems inappropriate to talk at an audible volume with strangers so close to you. Let's say you get a booth. Score! The booths are HUGE. You must have a family of nine, because the booths are large enough to accomodate a mid-size sedan and are usually filled with children. So many children. (Plight of going south in Tulsa, I suppose.) Here's the next awful thing: The menus are HUGE. They make close to every style of every dish ever. The thing is, the menus don't just have food in them- they have advertisements. I'll repeat that- ad-ver-tise-ments. It's offensive. I should be eating for free if they're getting paid by advertisers just to have me look at their menu.  Lastly, and I know this is nit-picky but I'm a Virgo, the waitstaff is forced to dress in white. Do you know how hard it is to find white pants? They look awful on everyone, they have a touch of the dingies and I feel so bad for these people to have to have more than one pair. Although, the young man who was serving us smelled as if he didn't worry about having backups or washing the current pair of choice. Excellent. Good food, but is it worth selling your soul? That's for you to decide I suppose. I did love the primavera.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=100
Ryan F.,"Tulsa, OK",1,9,,4.0,8/1/2009,"Despite being packed from open to close, The Cheesecake Factory is one of the classier, finer places where one can make a reservation. It is a chain, but it sets many standards to which others can follow. The presentation is very elaborate and well-maintained, and the service is professional. The staff truly make the place what it is. Were it any less, I would liken it to the flighty service (if one can call it 'service') from, say, TGIFriday's. The real shame is that even in a place like the Factory, where half of the people attending have the good sense to dress at least somewhat nicely, the rest just show up in hoodies and coveralls and moo-moos and the like. It's a great place, really. The location just seems to give people the impression that they should just come in the same clothes that they wore when they went next door: the mall. The food is magnificent. My appetizer was the pot stickers, and my main course was the most expensive item on the menu: the filet mignon. For any who can appreciate a good steak, I highly recommend it. I ordered mine well-done, and the mark of any good chef, in my opinion, is their ability to cook a steak to order. It seems simple, yet so many get it wrong. A steak cooked well is my favorite, yet it seems to be the biggest challenge for those in the kitchen due to the fact that I almost always have to send it back in because it's red. (Even still, once I get it back, chances are good that when I cut in, it'll still be red.) No such problem here. Upon cutting in, the meat was perfectly done, and not to the point where the chef merely left it on the grill to ""make sure"" it was done before serving it to me, effectively drying out the piece of meat as I had suffered through in other restaurants. It had no color, and it retained its juice. Needless to say, I was extremely impressed. I cleaned my plate, despite the gargantuan helping I'd been served, and I'd gone through roughly two or three Cokes. With my eyes being bigger than my stomach, I ordered the Linda's Fudge Cake for dessert, which, looking back, was a mistake. The cake weighed in at a massive six layers, with the slab of chocolate nearly taking up most of the plate, with three large puffs of heavy whipped cream lined up at the edge of the cake. Word to the wise: the whipped cream is just as rich and heavy as ice cream, and the cake is possibly the most succulent piece the bakery has to offer. I didn't finish, but the waiter was more than willing to take it back and box it up for me. This is a nice service-- if you don't finish your meal, you won't have to worry about taking your plate and clumsily letting your main course or dessert tumble inside, losing what form it may have. It is done for you. Don't overlook The Cheesecake Factory, even if you don't like cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tulsa?start=100

I was surprised when I called ahead ( from my Yelp BB app) that the wait was only 30 minutes, so we decided to risk the limos, makeup, and pimples. Walking in the decor is amazing.  It has the look of a very fancy upscale restaurant. Definately a plus when taking the Ms. out on the town. The waiting area left us a little cramped, but I'll give them that on prom night. Lets just say they were busy. Our wait was just around what we were quoted and we sat down in a private booth got to business. Drinks- Strawberry lemonade that was rediculous. I had heard the lemonades were good, but this was lemonade heaven.  She had the avacado chicken club. A mammoth sandwich packed with chicken, avacados, tomatoes, etc. I thought it lacked a little on dressing but it was good. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Bow tie pasta in a southern spicy sauce with what looked liked southern style chicken fingers on top. The portion was more than I could finish. The flavor was similar to Outback's Toowoomba Pasta, and the chicken complemented the sauce well. Dessert was the Banana Creme Cheesecake.  Cheesecake with a banana creme topping, whip cream and sliced bananas. Do I need to explain it? Overall I liked this place and will be back.

I tend to lean toward ordering what I know. The Chicken Madeira- Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce.  Served with Mashed Potatoes. YUM. Order a strawberry martini-they infuse fresh strawberries with Ketel One vodka, hand crafted per order. Stout but awesome-you can see the seeds floating in your drink and I always finish off with White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. So rich and by the point, you are stuffed but you have to have cheesecake. So, eat half your meal, take the rest home and always make room for dessert.

For our second appetizer we tried the tuna steak (cannot remember the exact name of the dish) and it was awesome too. I had the shrimp fettucini alfredo and my husband had the filet. Both were very yummy; I always make a point to try his dish too to get some variety. All in all, it is a great restaurant.
