138,Jan R.,"Braintree, MA",0,25,,1.0,2012-01-15,"Server took our order& brought the bill; never saw him otherwise.  Several different people brought out the food, which was horrible.  Potato skins and the French fries with the burgers were stale and tasted reheated. Very noisy. Were told a 10 min wait and waited 15 min, yet watched an older couple walk in and be seated immediately.

129,O K.,"Quincy, MA",0,2,,2.0,2012-01-26,"Expectations going into a Friday's are always low.  The food is cheap and edible, thats all that can be said.  The ambiance and service is terrible. That being said last nights experience was comical if nothing else.  I stopped in to order some takeout around 10pm.  Walked in the front door to see a hostess just stare at me with out any response to my hello.  Sat down at the bar and was promptly  greeted by the bartender.  I say I would like to order some take out and grab a beer while i wait.  I got the beer of the month special for $3 which was a bud light.  This is where the first odd action took place.  She attempted to do a glass trick which i believe was throwing it behind her head and catching it behind her back.  Well she was not very good at it as the glass slid down her back and caught it by clutching it against her butt.  Very odd and pretty gross.  The bartenders were very loud talking about the numerous mistakes they had been making while trying to communicate them with the other guests.   The food came out quickly and the total bill was $13.  The value was great everything else was as expected.  Both of the bartenders were friendly and accommodating.   You have to go to a place like this with little or no expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=160,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

156,Phuong D.,"Boston, MA",122,76,42.0,2.0,2012-06-12,"I rarely go eat here because I'm not really a fan of the chain. The times that I did go were mainly for friends' birthdays and this time it was for my friend's 21st birthday.  We came here around 10:30, considering the birthday girl got out of work at 10PM but lucky for us they're open till 1AM & their kitchen closes at 12:30AM, which is why we decided to come here. Food here is cheap as well so why not.  Our server was nice & took care of us, but the one bad thing about our service was that she disappeared a couple of times for a long while & left us there wondering what happened to her Lol. It was between 3 girlfriends and we all decided to order the 3 course meal for $16.99. For appetizers we got crispy green bean fries, mozzarella sticks and potstickers. In my opinion I think the potstickers were the best out of 3. My friends liked the mozzarella sticks & just avoid the crispy green bean fries. They weren't that great.  For entrees I had the petite filet I think? The smallest steak they had, I think it's a 6 oz. with seasoned fries and roasted veggies. This was a disappointment. The steak came out PUNY and I asked for medium, which is a pink center and it was well-done. I was quite angry; I'm not usually picky when it comes to how my steak is cooked. If I ask for medium & as long as it has a pink center, I'm satisfied but here it was well done and just so hard to cut and chew. I'm also not the type to tell the server I'm dissatisfied either. I usually feel really bad, so I never say anything and so I didn't. It was still edible so I ate it. It was late at night and I didn't wanna tell her to have them re-cook my steak correctly and have them spit in my food. The roasted veggies were the best thing on my plate.  What sucks is that we waited until 12AM, which was when my friend turned 21 and we were all stoked for her to order her first legal drink and she wasn't allowed to because it's against the law to order drinks right at 12AM and that she couldn't get to until 8 hours after 12AM. Yeah, cause she's going to wake up at 8AM to order a drink lol. They said it's cause they're corporate and that's why it wasn't allowed. So if you're planning to celebrate your 21st and wait till 12AM there, DON'T DO IT, THEY'RE GOING TO CRUSH YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS.  Another funny thing, the food runner spilled lemonade all over the birthday girl HAHA. It was quite funny but screwed up at the same time. It was an accident but her pants were all sticky afterward. Good thing she wore black dress pants. The manager gave us free appetizer/dessert cards as an apology. Don't want to come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=140,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

I ordered the mouthwatering fried green beans: Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta:   And peanut butter chocolate pie: All on the 3 for $16 menu( or something lie that). Tis includes 1 app, 1 entree and 1 dessert for around $17. SWEEEEEET!!!  Our waitress Kyanna was good but rather forgetful. Just kept forgetting drink orders, but rather polite.  My friends surprised me with a cake and the staff sang BUT the slice of cake was wrapped up to-go and my friend was pretty upset that it wasnt served on a plate with a candle( like the other table was served). We tried to calm her down but she wanted to say something to the waitress about it. We stopped her because I really didn't care.  *Another side effect of a forgetful waitress.

204,Sandy W.,"Boston, MA",139,55,49.0,1.0,2012-12-28,"Hi! I had the worst experience at TGIF for lunch with my family today. It took the waitress a little bit to come to our table to take our drink orders in. She came back with our drinks, and took our lunch orders. When the food came out, my nephew's skewed chicken were all burnt. I asked the waitress to replace the order as it was too burnt for a 3 year old to eat. She said to have him try it, and if he doesn't like it... then, she would replace it. The 3 entree were good, but she never came back to check on us if my nephew's burnt skewed chicken needed to be replaced, and just never came back to ask us if we needed anything else. We FINALLY flagged her down to have her refill our drinks. She came back with just 1 cup of hot water (for my sister-in-law, totally neglected my mom) and myself included. I actually had to split the cup of hot water for them to drink. By the time the check came, TGIF charged us almost $6 for 2 cups of hot water. When I asked the waitress, she responded saying there wasn't an option for hot water in the system, so she had to put it in as 2 cups of hot tea. I requested that to be taken off the bill since they don't charge for ice water. Her attitude changed very quickly, and started being quite difficult about it. I would be totally fine if we really ordered 2 cups of hot tea, but since it was just hot water - this shouldn't have been an issue on the check in the first place. At the end, she did remove the 2 hot teas from the check. Also, my iced tea was never refilled at all during my meal, she never came over to check on us. Is there a reason in going back to TGIF after this experience?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=180,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

I'm typically patient of some element of slow service, however our server left us there for 15 minutes, before he brought the drinks, didn't clear the table between starters and dinner, and forgot items we ordered. I was brought my drink after I finished my meal. We also had to get up and ask for our silverware.  To put the icing on the cake it was a $66.00 tab, we had kids mac and cheese, w cheese burgers, and one entree item with no alcohol drinks. I was amazed at how over priced the food was, which was ok but $66.00??? Guess who is paying for all their marketing? I like going out to dinner, but it should not have taken that long either.

The biggest problem was when we called 15 minutes after leaving when we discovered that we didn't have the credit card that we used for payment.  The girl who answered the telephone seemed as though she couldn't be bothered with the issue.  When I asked her if she could possibly look around the booth where we were sitting, she huffed an exasperated sigh, and after only a few seconds (not more than half a minute), returned and said they couldn't find anything.  It was 4:00pm on a weekday with a snowstorm coming into town.  To say that they were ""slow"" or ""not busy"" is an understatement.     I would have asked to be transferred to a manager to convey my disgust with her customer service, but it was more pressing to call the bank to cancel the card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=120,2.04,2.04,2.04,2.056,2.04

I had to laugh at the one review about a hair on their food , saying she usually gets comped when complaining about her meal. Kind of sounds like she does this complaining all the time, and just because she didn't get compt, she now writes a terrible review.  The fact is....this is a chain restaurant. Pick your battles. That hair could have come from your own head or could have flown on the plate as the dish was being carried to your table. hardly a reason to be compt.  The restaurant is noisy and busy. Gets a movie theater crowd. very diverse customer crowd. Service could be better, I grant you that. The food is chain food. Not fine dining.....bar food.

Let's start with my food- the chicken was moist, but surprisingly chewy. It wasn't terrible, so I did eat it.  I pretty much love JD sauce, so anything smothered in that is A-okay with me. My hubby's sizzling chicken and shrimp (that he has ordered in the past) came out, how do I say this- not sizzling? Hardly any cheese, and he was clearly disappointed. We joked that maybe they were running low on cheese!   On the upside I had a coupon so I didn't pay full price.  The waitress was OK.

We kept waiting for refills and I was so annoyed because they were out of everything.. they probably have like 10-15 draft options and they were out of 5 of them. I don't know who is in charge of ordering the kegs, but they are doing a bad job with that. I think I'd have better luck at a local dive bar.

Nobody in the waiting area had the guts to ask the hostess what the wait was for when the place was empty. So, I decided to go up to her and asked politely if they were short on waitstaff or anything else. She told us it was the kitchen being backed up not even looking at my face at this point... We were seated after 20 minutes or so and put in our orders right away. I had asked for chips & salsa before the food was ready. I had to chase the waiter twice to remind him on the chips.

She promptly brought the drinks and food wasn't far behind. I got the jack Daniels combo. The ribs were decent but the steak was very under seasoned. Just bland.. Which was a shame because it was grilled nicely. The sweet potato fries were, on the other hand, soggy and cold. And the portion of fries was abnormally small. Which I can hardly complain about because they left a great deal to be desired.  The table next to ours left shortly after we were seated.

We went on a Saturday and walked in at 4:40 for an early dinner. We waited about 15 minutes for a table. Once we were seated we were told our server would be right over. It was a little confusing because there were empty tables everywhere and a ton of people waiting in the front..anyways..after sitting at our table for 20 mins I got up and talked to the manager to inform him no one has come over. The hostess walked by and chimed in ""your server is coming over now""..That's great and all but 20 mins is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!

The only good thing is the bar.  If you're looking to grab a drink or two with your friends and split a basic bar app, it's not a bad deal.  That is, if you can survive the parking lot.

Food portion is decent and prices reasonable. Personally, I like the updated interior design compare to their original restaurant style. Parking will vary depending on which day and timing because of all the other restaurants/stores that have been added to the location. Dinner... was okay. I feel like their portions have decresed in size since the new restaurant. I still enjoy their food and the atmosphere. Dinner experience was just blah, and it wasn't even that busy when I went (7pm on a Saturday night).  Services is good. On both occasions (and before the renovation they had), I feel that the waitresses and waitors keep an eye on you and come by once in awhile but also keep space so I can chat with friends and enjoy my food. In other words, they don't feel clingy but just enough when you need a new drink, done with your food and ready to order desserts, and whatever else.

109,Keryn F.,"Quincy, MA",19,24,,2.0,2015-01-25,"My friends and I have gone to this Fridays location for years, but ever since the renovation, the experience has gone downhill, culminating in the cluster that was last night. I was going out with friends to celebrate my birthday, and Friday's was easy, centrally located, and has accommodated our large parties in the past. I called ahead a little before 6, and told them that we would be there between 7 and 7:30 and we had 13 people. The hostess put me on hold, came back, said that was fine, took my name and number, and hung up. I immediately received a text from their automated call-ahead service, so I figured we were all set. One of my friends arrived at 6:40 and told the hostess, ""I know I'm early, but I'm here for Keryn, party of 13, and I just wanted to check in."" The hostess acknowledged that she was there and went about her business. Once most of the people had arrived (around 7:05), she approached again and said,  ""No rush, but I just wanted to let you know that most of our party is here,"" in case they had the table ready. The hostess gave her a blank stare and said, ""Ummm, what party is that?"" She reminded her who she was and the waitress got a deer-in-headlights look and said,  ""Ohhh...yup, let me just check in with my manager."" Around 7:25, the hostess came over and said, ""Okay, all set"" and led us to and area with two half moon tables (side by side) which were across from two 2 seater tables, and told us, ""Okay, you guys have these four tables."" We all just kind of looked at each other and began awkwardly dividing into small groups, until one of my friends spoke up and said, ""Is there any chance we could get one table together?"" She said, ""Well, the wait for that would be about an hour."" Another friend asked if we could at least push the 2 seaters together and she said, ""I'll go ask the manager."" So, the manager comes out, and says, ""Sorry, guys, we can't push those tables together"" and cited the fire code. Not, 'Sorry, guys, we forgot about you/made a mistake/are sticking you at four mini tables that aren't even really that close to one another.' Just sorry about the fire code. One of my friends asked the manager about one group table, and he said, ""Well, it's a two hour wait, but you can wait if you want. We have a few big parties tonight."" My friend said, ""Okay, I guess we're just thrown off because we called ahead, checked in early, and no one even asked if we'd mind being separated."" The manager said something to the effect of the other parties having called first, but that he would take full responsibility (for what? They didn't even admit to making a mistake). Nothing to address the fact that they had tried to pass off sitting us at four different tables as normal. Everyone looked to me (as it was my birthday) to decide what to do. I said I would rather wait. The manager shrugged and said, ""Okay, well it'll be about two hours."" So, we returned to the lobby and began calling around to other restaurants to check their wait times and found somewhere with no wait. One of my friends went back to tell the manager to take us off the list. He (my friend) told him that he appreciated the manager taking the blame even though it obviously wasn't his fault and asked what we could do in the future to avoid losing our place in line. The manager's only suggestion was to make sure we talked to a supervisor when we called. Now, let me just say, I have a LOT of respect and empathy for people who work in food service. I have been a customer service manager for a retailer and I know how much it sucks when one person makes a dumb mistake and other people have to take the heat for it (not that any of us were rude, but it was obvious that we were not thrilled with the situation). If they had just owned that a mistake had been made, apologized, and given us some options (sit separately or wait longer), I would not be writing this. I just cannot fathom how someone in a management position could look at our situation and choose to handle it the way they did. Like, did they think we wouldn't notice that we weren't sitting together? Come on.

A far better dining experience than I had at this chain years and years ago.  The beer selection was good and a cosmo that I had tasted fresh and light. I returned here since and found my shrimp dish was no longer on the menu. I did have a chicken salad sandwich which was served on thick fresh bread.  It was definitely tasty.  Service was good on both visits. We were both surprised at the number of kids dining here. Maybe they have a good kids' menu. Bathrooms were nice. I guess they renovated this place somewhat recently.

I've never had this problem that some people have with the long food waits. The one thing that I will agree on with some of the other reviewers is that a manager around here is rare to find.

First off, the waitress got my appetizer order wrong which was an easy fix. Then when my meal came that was also wrong, when I informed her that she had brought me the wrong meal she offered to ""throw some shrimp on it"" because it would take too long to have them make the correct meal for me. I told he that I didn't mind waiting for the correct order. I should mention that every time I go to TGI Fridays I order the same thing so I know exactly what I'm ordering. The waitress returned after just a few minutes and she told me that the cook ""assured her that the two meals are pretty much the same"" and she left the plate at my table stating that she would bring me the shrimp to throw on the side. I know that the meals are not the same because I ORDER IT ALL THE TIME. The waitress refused to get me the correct order so I refused to eat it. The shrimp that she brought over was just fried on a random plate. Then she offered to take my meal off the bill. As if I would pay for the wrong order that I didn't even take a bite out of.  Things kept getting worse. She brought us the wrong bill and when she realized that she messed that up too she just came over and tossed our receipt on the table as if we were the ones who kept messing up all night. She made a very sad attempt at an apology that reeked of an attitude as she continued to debate with me that there was nothing wrong with my meal. I order the chicken and shrimp that comes covered in cheese with mashed potatoes. She brought me the chicken and spinach that had a sour tasting sauce with tomatoes.

I actually didn't mind this because we were near the restroom (last time we were across the restaurant). It was convenient to have the restroom right there.  Our waiter was much less attentive. I understand that it was lunch time, and I understand we were in the corner booth, but service really lagged.  We waited about 5 minutes before he came to get our drink orders. Our appetizer took about 15 minutes to come. It was the Garlic Parm. Chicken. It was delicious, and I recommend it as an appetizer. After that, we got our meals. The appetizer dishes were taking up space on the table but the waiter was no where to be seen. When we were done, the check was requested, but it took him 10 minutes to get it.  Food was average.

Told wait to be seated would be 20 minutes - there were empty tables.  I know this sometimes can be attributed to someone calling in, plus it was pretty busy, so we didn't think anything of that.  It was actually less than 20 minutes.  That was the highlight.  This was myself, my husband and our 6 year old daughter.  She looks 6 and acts 6.  Young man who seated us (zero personality) grabbed 3 adult menus.  When we got to the table, he said ""Oh, I'll get you a kids' menu"" and walked away.  That is the last we ever saw of him.   We waited for a while, and watched other parties be seated and greeted before our server finally came over.  We ordered drinks.  She came back with drinks.  We first asked for an appetizer of potato skins, then we ordered our dinners.  Daughter and I asked for the same thing:  chicken fingers, fries, honey mustard on the side.  Hers: kids' sized, mine, adult-sized.  Husband asked for a burger with fries.  She left to (presumably) put our orders in.  Let the waiting begin!   In the course of our waiting for our food, we saw:  two tables near us order food, get their food, get more drinks and one of them get their checks, pay and leave.  Those tables had the same server.  He looked like he was doing a good job.  We also watched our server take the orders of a table directly next to ours, but not check to see if we were ok.  Note:  this was at the end of a particularly long day, so my daughter was very hungry, more than a little tired (but being super-good, which was a blessing)... but she is a kid.  She wants her dinner.  Our server finally comes back, looks at our table and says ""They didn't bring your food""?  Um, NO!!!  Husband She hustles away, saying she will get the manager.  Wait some more.  Manager comes, says it's on him.  We mention the potato skins, he looks confused.  My guess:  no potato skins were ordered when our dinner orders went to the kitchen.  Still...no...food.   Runner comes, brings the burger/fries and my dinner.  Nothing for daughter.  Seriously?!  Out of everyone at the table, you don't bring the dinner for the kid who is now near tears and all you had to do was make mine, take some off and put it on a smaller plate?!  Two things of potato skins show up - we send one away (I blame the hunger and fatigue as to why we didn't just take both and horde some for later).  Server reappears - ""Um, can we please have her dinner now?"".  She goes away and comes back with smaller version of mine...  huzzah!  Asks husband if he wants another beer.  He nods and says ""Yes"".  This apparently means ""don't really bring me another beer - I was just kidding"" as one never appears.    This is pretty much how some of other visits to that particular location have gone.  With the nightmare of a parking lot that is there now, we have reached our capacity for nonsense and will maybe go to other locations, but not this one.  I am glad others have had better experiences, as the chain itself is pretty good...  just not for us I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=120,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.8920000000000003,2.36

When i got it though there was a little sauce on it, but the piece of mahi mahi was actually tiny. I mean the picture made it look thick and big like a brick of it was going to be served but what i got was more like a ruler that was cut in half. It still wasn't half bad though just thought it was gonna look more like the picture, big and thick. Service is decent, seems like theres always only 2 bartenders on (which shouldn't be a problem i assume but ive never been a bartender) but we have had a time or two where it was a little hard to get a bartenders attention for another drink. the decor inside is nice and it seems really clean which is good.

There were plenty of waiters/waitress' walking around so I finally asked if someone could wait on us. Our waiter came over and was apologetic. We ended up just getting appetizers and drinks knowing it will take forever if we even dared get a meal. Our appetizers took forever! Seriously more than 25 min for apps. Our drinks came out at a decent time though. To kill time while waiting for our apps we ordered patron shots. The most disappointing thing ever. They were NOT patron shots.

87,Brian H.,"Weymouth, MA",2,2,,1.0,2016-03-06,"I came here with my girlfriend at about 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon. We walked in and it was pretty quiet, but we still stood there for a few minutes before anyone asked if we had been helped yet. We informed the woman that we hadn't, and she asked us to have a seat as they got a table ready. She then returned and asked if we minded to sit at a two person booth and we said no that's fine, which we then realized was next to the kitchen. I ordered a Crown Apple drink, which was on the menu, and was waiting for about 15 minutes before the waitress came and said she was waiting for a manager to go out back and get the Crown Royal Apple. She returned twice in the next 10 minutes to say that they were still waiting on the manager to get the bottle from the back. About 5 minutes later she came over and said ""I'm so sorry but we're all out of Crown Apple""....I said that's fine and ordered a margarita. At this time we also asked if we could change tables, since we were in a very busy area next to the kitchen and weren't comfortable. The waitress informed us that there weren't any tables available because they were in the middle of a shift change. (At this time we were staring at SEVERAL empty tables right next to us) We had also ordered an appetizer of boneless buffalo wings with our drinks, which eventually came and was plain chicken with a side of bleu cheese. We were confused about this, but not surprised since our waitress seemed lost most of the time. We didn't send it back since we were very hungry already and didn't want to wait any longer...the chicken was alright but you might as well just get a bucket of popcorn chicken from KFC for half the price. As for our food, my girlfriend ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes and I ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. After waiting a decent amount of time, we were ready for our second drink. I decided to get a corona-Rita, a margarita with a little corona in it. My girlfriend got the same drink as she did before, a cotton candy martini type drink. About 20 minutes went by and I said to her ""I bet she'll come back and say they're out of little coronas."" A few minutes later the waitress came and said ""I'm so sorry but you're just unlucky today, we're all out of the little coronas."" Haha it was unbelievable, but I also wasn't really surprised and couldn't help but laugh, this place had no leadership or communication among the staff. This was the second thing on the menu I ordered that they were out of and took over 20 minutes for them to figure out.  We were waiting well over an hour for our meals. The waitress returned a few times to inform us that she was still waiting on them to come out of the kitchen. She also mentioned that the wait staff is always waiting on the kitchen. Another nearby waiter also commented on this and said that the wait staffs tips are suffering because of How long the food takes. This made us feel a little sympathy for the wait staff, but our waitress also didn't care enough to change our table as we had politely requested earlier, so the kitchen wasn't the only issue with this place. My girlfriends meal eventually came out and the waitress said they were still waiting on mine. At this time it had to have been at least an hour and a half since we ordered. The waitress also said that if I was unhappy I could talk to a manager so they could comp some of the meal. My meal eventually came out and the manager was behind the waitress and informed me that my meal would be comped and they apologized for the wait. This was a nice gesture but didn't even come close to making up for the horrible experience we had at this restaurant. The food actually wasn't bad but the service was so awful that I'll never return to this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=80,2.08,2.25,2.25,1.7000000000000002,2.1820000000000004

38,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565.0,1.0,2016-04-25,"TGI Fridays in Braintree is the only original place in this new claustrophobic shopping center on Forbes Road in Braintree.  I have many complaints about this Friday's location, and have very few good things to say. Because I like being positive, I will talk about the few good things keeping this restaurant alive. It's clean, new, and renovated. Manager Doug and Krista are friendly and are very helpful if you had a bad experience (which I did, twice now). Otherwise, the first turn off to me (the first time I went to this restaurant) was the location. It's in a new small shopping plaza off Route 37 in Braintree, and always (during the week and weekends!) has loads of traffic from the exit all the way up the ramp to the TGI Fridays and sometimes even into the tiny parking lot. Additionally, the parking lot is always chalked full, and there are no take out spots (Are you joking TGI? You couldn't put ONE take out spot in!). The parking lot for the TGI Fridays in Dedham is larger than the parking lot for this full shopping center! Yikes. Anyway, the main issue here was that I ordered a burger to go (plain, just cheese), as I was in the area. I got home, and there was all this junk all over it (not what I ordered). There was no way I was driving all the way to Braintree to get it fixed, so I called them, spoke with Doug, who gave me a few free appetizer / dessert cards for my next visit. Yet, this has happened twice now. Mistakes happen once, and I gave them another chance. The next chance wasn't for them to mess up again, and rather to pull in me, as a customer, to come back again. Living so close to the TGI Fridays in Dedham, I will continue to patronize there. There are some friendly managers here, but the staff are clueless, and don't know exactly what they are doing, and essentially that comes back to management. Too bad. For this area, my suggestions are TGI Fridays in Dedham or Stoughton.... both are much better. 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=40,1.96,2.26,2.26,1.3800000000000003,2.1399999999999997

We got seated immediately but my daughter had to use the bathroom. To do so you have to walk by the kitchen which is all open so you can see everything inside which I am completely grateful that it was. The floors were absolutely disgusting they were black and I'm pretty sure they're supposed to be gray. There was old food underneath all of the stations And over where they got the ice the floor is peeling up an absolutely disgusting with food everywhere there was food dripping down the counters were the cooks made things. The pots and pans were stacked up on a counter on the side and the outsides of them was burnt with something. When we got back to the table our entrees where there, which was the pretzel in beer batter cheese. The pretzels were burnt and hard and disgusting. I opened one of the silverware so I could try to cut one up for my daughter and they were was still food all over the fork . So I called over a waitresses I  showed her and asked if I could have another set of silverware she walked over to the station next to us got another set of silverware and handed it to me I open that one and there was dried egg all over my knife, so I called her back over and asked her nicely if I could please have another set of silverware she walked over to the same station grabbed another set of silverware tossed it lately on the table and told me she hopes it's clean enough for me this time. My husband had asked for a beer, my daughter got a chocolate milk and I had asked for a water with lemon. When the waitress was walking over we noticed she was holding my husband's glass and my glass with her fingers inside of our glasses I then told her I didn't want that and I asked for another one. she had brought me over another glass and I started staring around the lemon and all of this white stuff started floating from the bottom of my cup to the top. At that point I already ordered dinner but I refuse to eat there. So I called her over and told her that I was all set with my meal and I would like her to cancel it for  the receipt. When my daughter received her meal her noodles were so hard that she couldn't eat them the only thing that was edible was my husband's Meal which I can't recall what he had ordered. The waitress had walked by a Moment before we felt we were ready to leave. We then sat there for over 30 minutes waiting for her to return so we could get a check. So I had walked up to a bunch of the waitresses and waiters and ask them if there was a manager I could speak to. When I spoken to the manager he told me he was going to take care of it and he would bring us our check mind you I'd already told him what has happened during this visit at TGIF's. When he had brought over the receipt Not only was my meal on there but my daughter's too along with my drink because I did not assume any of those things I refuse to pay for them. I nicely told him I would like those things to be removed from the receipt that I refused to pay for them and he had walked back to the register and took them off and explain to my husband what he had done.

The waiter said the most he could do is either give us a free appetizer or 20% off for the wait. Wait what? Not for the bad steak? We also ordered the pick 3 appetizers.

What kind of service is that? He never removed the empty glasses from our table either so it was a cluster of horrible food and empty glasses. I took two bites from my meal and so did my friends. It was disgusting. I ordered salmon with lobster and it was lukewarm and tasteless. The tomato mozzarella salad was warm and wilting as a result of sitting on my plate for too long. The waiter never asked my friend how she wanted her steak cooked, so after she specified how she did want it, it was still wrong. No apology from the waiter. The employees were sitting around chatting instead of doing their jobs. No ""have a nice day"" on the way out either. The girls at the front made eye contact and proceeded to gossip.

89,Doris N.,"Brockton, MA",58,3,,1.0,2016-07-05,"Since I already had an hour of my time wasted today, I created a sign in on Yelp just to leave this review. I ordered soup, sweet potato fries and mac-n-cheese (all easily prepared and PRE-PREPPED items) and was told it would take 20 mins. I come back in after 25 mins and end up waiting another 15 minutes. In other words, I had to wait 40 minutes for SIDE ORDER ITEMS. I was told ""there was a mix up"" and they plated my food instead of sending it out to go. I can't understand how there was a ""mix up"" that took 15 minutes to correct when I came in on a Tuesday for take-out.  As I am driving the 4 minutes it takes to get back to my office, I state, ""I bet the food is cold."" Surprise, surprise! The fries were limp and cold, the soup (SOUP!) was warm. I don't care who is at fault but that was one mistake too many. This is my first AND LAST TIME ordering anything here.  Actually, Fridays ruined it for the whole plaza. I am beyond tired of being a customer at restaurants that don't care about me, my health or my money and offer long waits for crap food in the name of convenience. What a waste of my time to even put up a review - I didn't check Yelp before I drove to this lousy joint, did you?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=80,1.6,2.18,2.18,1.7320000000000002,1.9480000000000004
25,Joe G.,"Boston, MA",103,6,4.0,2.0,2016-07-10,"I usually do not dine at chain restaurants, but I received a gift card for Friday's so I decided to go with a friend. We started by each ordering a beer and the Jack Daniel's sampler for an appetizer. The beers took about 5 minutes and the appetizer arrived about 10-15 minutes after we got the beers. It seemed like a long time but the restaurant was also very busy.  The appetizer was just ok. Totally not worth the $14. Our meals took a long time to come out, place was busy, but it was not worth the wait at all. I got a fish sandwich which was so soggy it just fell apart was a tried to pick it up. The fries were room temperature and also soggy. The sandwich was supposed to have kale and a white sauce on it, but it had spinach and no sauce.  My friend also did not like his chicken sandwich. His was super dry, didn't have the cheese melted at all, and lacked the sauce it was supposed to have on it.  Experiences like these are the reason I choose local restaurants over these expensive chains. Even if a local restaurant is a bit more expensive, it's worth it for a decent meal.  Overall, server was friendly but food was not good at all. Not worth the money, even with a $50 gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=40,1.64,2.16,2.16,1.832,1.952

Our waitress was okay, but took a crazy amount of time to get everything and she only had two other tables. While the food was good, it took a long time. She barely checked in with us or engaged with us at all. However, the biggest problem, and the reason I'm writing this post is because of the hosts. One was a larger girl with short hair and a another girl with long curly black hair. I watched (and the reason I saw all this was because the service and food took so long) as two groups came in and they all had to wait a very long time to even be greeted. The restaurant was not busy. I would see the two hosts standing in the kitchen staring at the people waiting by the podium and sipping their drinks, allowing them to wait for quite a long time. One couple came in and the hosts were standing at the podium just talking and didn't say a word to them, so they just sat at the bar. I thought that was already ridiculous as I've been a host and server, but when a man and his blind wife came in with her service dog and the hosts just stared at them from the kitchen while talking for a few minutes and then finally one slowly made her way over, I couldn't believe it.

The attraction of the $10.00 endless apps grabbed our attention. I had a tall draft of Sam Adams Cold Snap and my companion had a blueberry pomegranate iced tea with liquor.  We chose potato skins and boneless buffalo wings.  Our server Cory seemed busy, but upon hearing from two young lady's to our left it turned out to be Cory not paying attention to them or to us. It took longer than it should of to get water. Once the food came we were enjoying it but needed more sour cream and blue cheese for dipping.  Thankfully the female bartender who was there(I didn't get her name) made our experience tolerable.  We decided to order another round of the chicken.  To our suprise we were charged for them. I asked Cory about it. I found it strange that if we paid the $10.00 any other orders of the  same were endless meaning no cost. He did remove it from our bill. Then the most confusing thing happened. I had a free birthday treat coupon which he suggested to me shouldn't have been used.

The building itself is nice enough. There's a large bar area, plenty of tables and booths in the general dining area, and several tvs around. What really killed this place was the service. I was in a group of 4 people, there for dinner. Getting seated was quick, but then just getting drinks and utensils took over half an hour. The food took over an hour to get to the table, and when it did, it quickly became clear that some people's food had been done long ago, and must have been sitting under a warmer for too long, giving it a sad, dead look to it. Even waiting for the check at the end took another 30+ minutes, as we could clearly watch our waitress just chatting with her coworkers in the corner. We eventually gave up on hoping she would come back and take our credit cards, and instead pooled together our cash, dropped it on the table, and just walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=20,1.88,2.09,2.09,1.4160000000000001,2.0060000000000002

They forgot the sauce for the green been fries and despite being there early to pick up and opening the box as soon as I got back, they were soggy.

58,Amelia G.,"Quincy, MA",0,2,,1.0,2017-08-05,"ZERO STARS! I wrote a review for this location in March 2016 about the extreme lack of organization and professionalism of this restaurant. I am now updating my review for this SAME location from my most recent experience. It has not improved AT ALL. If anything it has gotten worse. I came here on a Sunday night with my parents that were in town. I have not been to this location since my previous review but my dad wanted to come here. It was not a busy Sunday night yet all of the employees seemed like they had better things to do. We wanted a booth at the bar and the host said that we could go pick our own. Well...3 of the available booths had not been cleared from the previous customers. We waited about 5 min to see if someone would get to it and nothing despite walking past the tables countless times to talk with each other. My mom worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years and she kindly asked someone to clean the table off. They said they'd get to it and walked away. We waited 10 more minutes. Then I said screw it and went over to grab the spray and cloth and wiped it down myself. The waitress came over and didn't even apologize when she saw us cleaning the table. She took our drink orders which took 20 minutes to get back to us. My dad's margarita was NOT a margarita, it was awful. So he ordered a beer. WE WAITED FOR THIS BEER FOR AN HOUR! The waitress didn't even explain to us the situation that I guess was that they were having an issue with the tap. We found that info out after requesting a manager since we had not gotten our food or a beer. The manager apologized and had nothing to say about us or the other 2 tables that ended up cleaning off their own table as well. Our food came out and was terribly cold and my dad finally got his beer. We get the check and it's over $100. They charged for the ""margarita"" that tasted like grapefruit juice gone bad. And the manager offered nothing for the extreme inconvenience. My mom is always one to tip over the average due to her previously working in this environment. She did not tip and I do not blame her! This whole business in Braintree are lazy!!! There was no communication from the waitress about the beer, she kept avoiding  us and we had to flag her down. The food bad, and the manager, unprofessional to say the least. It's embarrassing that this establishment has not improved at all but gotten worse within a year.

4,Steve W.,"Braintree, MA",3,12,5.0,1.0,2017-08-06,"I have ate here for many years; even before the remodel. Used to love going here, but today I must write them off.  It started when they removed my favorite BBQ sauce; this is petty I know so that doesn't reflect my review, but is the start of the downfall. I had wrote them off for it as I always ordered this however I decided to give them one more chance and to my delight they brought it back!! Though now I question the sanitary levels here. We entered a restaurant that had only about 25% capacity due to a new restaurant nearby opening. This happens, but what is unexceptionable is the fact we were given menus with decayed food inside of them then silverware that was dirty, not once or twice, but three times. Food all over the knives and forks to the point we were utterly disgusted and had to walk out. Another disgusting moment was when we asked for a tasting of the BBQ sauce so I would know if it had changed... I tasted it and it was my old sauce, but then noticed old food stuck to the dish and this combined with the rest made me literally ask the manager if there was a problem with the dishwasher in which he said ""no"" then proceeded to say that these things happen.

The potato skins were okay - they weren't quite warm enough and seemed dried out. The boneless wings were good, but again not too warm. My husband ate the sliders - he said they were not good at all. Not sure why but they had almost no toppings - maybe some sauce only. The pretzels were forgotten but brought after we reminded the waiter. They were probably the hottest, freshest thing we had eaten! They were good but the cheese sauce was odd tasting. The overall presentation of the food on the plate was pretty sad too - I wasn't expecting fine dining presentation but it looked like they just tossed the food on a too-large plate with no thought to how it looked.

Which is fine, it's busy, I arrived around 8:30, let the host in the front know who I was, and they told me they'd bring it out when it was ready. Cool. I took a seat, pulled out my phone, and starting reading. The hosts at the front of the restaurant were doing great, making sure everybody was being helped and letting people know that they're doing their best to get their food to them. There were other people waiting before me for their food, so I figured I'd let them figure out what's going on first before I asked again about my order. Quite a long time past. In fact, an hour or so past. Not exaggerating.  I was approaching by one of the hosts, who had come in after I initially came in, and asked me what I was waiting for again. I told her, and she went to the back to double check on my order since it had been so long. She came back with the surprising news that my order was not back there, being worked on, or even in the queue. I double checked the app - I did order takeout for the correct store, I had a receipt, and my card had already been charged $23.33. I confirmed this with her. Everything was in order, but after waiting over an hour for my food, it didn't look like I'd be getting my food that night. She took down my information, and told me I'd be reimbursed in a few days, or I'd get a call from a manager. This all happened a week ago. Still no call, still no reimbursement. Fine. I called them tonight, around 9:30 PM. Again, I know it's a busy night, and I was on hold for a bit, which is fine, and I was told they would give me a call back later in the night since the manager was caught up with other things. Again, fine, I know it's busy. I'd expect a call back sometime tonight. I've never received a call. They haven't gotten back to me, nor refunded me for my food that I never received due to incompetence. This is actually extremely laughable. I sense no urgency, no yearning to help the guest, no rush to fix an issue. I shouldn't have to make a trip back to this place to get my money back, but I guess I'll have to. I've tried being nice, and patient, and pleasant. At the end of the day, it's only a bit of money. It was just a couple of burgers. But how do you run a very popular food chain restaurant with such a lack of integrity? To be paid by a consumer for a simple food order, they never receive it, and it's so hard to refund them without my further inconvenience? I sat there for over an hour waiting for food that never came, I shouldn't have to waste anymore of my time dealing with this. But I have to. All due to severe, glaring incompetence by the management team at this establishment. A glaring lack of urgency to fix a problem and retain a consumer. A total loss of professionalism and ethics.  It's not about the amount of money, the time spent, or the food ordered. It's about there being a clear problem, with no follow up and no accountability. With no care for the consumer, and I implore you, whoever is reading this, take your business elsewhere. Support locally run restaurants, or a chain that actually gives a darn about their consumer base. There are many, many reviews on here that have stories similar to mine.  Let's hope in five years, T.G.I Fridays will either have a stupendous turnaround in customer satisfaction and dedication, or they'll be out of business. I really hope for the former, but I highly expect the latter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3,1.2,1.79,1.79,,1.5540000000000003
76,Matt C.,"Rockland, MA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-10,Horrible service. Obviously can't employ anyone over 20 to work for them. No adult supervision for a bunch of high school employees. Food sucks now. My boneless buffalo wings came out cold. Food came out before horribly made cocktails. Had to watch every employee screw around in the kitchen. The new open kitchen design was a bad idea considering everyone just screws around near your food in front of you. This place defiantly needs a manager over 25 present to babysit all these underage idiots.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3,1.2,1.77,1.77,,1.5420000000000003
31,Natalie H.,"Plymouth, MA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-15,"I came in on Saturday evening and my goodness, what a mess! My partner and I walked over to the bar to sit and were debating a table. There were plenty of tables available but every single one of them was covered in dirty dishes. I counted 7+ tables with dishes not including a couple of seats at the bar also with old dishes still sitting there. The bartender never made eye contact with us and/or said she'd be right with us. She kept walking back and forth hardly helping anyone else. I saw one other busser/server who was walking around with a dust pan and broom taking her sweet time, also ignoring all the dirty tables. After about 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave. Not one of the dishes were picked up during that time and not one employee had a smile on their face. I felt bad for they must be understaffed and/or poorly managed. We went over to Legal Seafoods and had a wonderful meal. The staff at Legal Seafoods said this Fridays location has been in terrible shape for awhile. Someone save this restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=40,1.2,1.73,1.73,,1.5180000000000002
6,Jeremy M.,"Somerville, MA",152,6,,1.0,2017-11-16,"Holy hell ....I'll never come back to this location ever again. The waitress we had was awful , it took this girl 10 minutes to get a soda order back to us just because she couldn't help but talk to the other co workers she worked with at their gossip booth. Not only that the manager wasn't helping that issue either by just talking it up with them either just laughing away. The order of potato skins we got was warm not even hot due to her forgetting to put the order in ( I only know she forgot because she put ASAP on the receipt) and after we got that didn't even bother to ask how they were. Tonight was dead at this location ....no excuse for saying ""they were busy cut her slack"" or ""maybe the kitchen was backed up"". The food came to us 40 minutes later and she couldn't remember for the life of her what we got which also my girlfriends food came back burnt( chicken Caesar salad) the chicken was BURNT to hell. What got me the most is this waitress didn't bother asking if we needed refills or even asked how the food was....LET ALONE leave the corner she kept going to where her co workers were to chat away and not give a damn. Yeah .....needless to say I'll NEVER go back to this horrible service place ever again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=20,1.12,1.72,1.72,,1.4800000000000002
71,Kortney G.,"Hartford, CT",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-28,"THE worst dining experience I've had in a very long time. We arrived one hour and thirty minutes before our movie, knew exactly what we wanted to order. Waited 25 minutes for a server to come to our table. Another 15 to get our order in, then about 30 more to have our food delivered. We ended up missing our movie and will never be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3,1.12,1.69,1.69,,1.4620000000000002
3,M.Daniel F.,"Braintree, MA",0,10,,1.0,2017-12-05,"Five of us were looking for a change in the same 'ol same 'ol places we always go, sometimes you learn that change can suck. We went to the Forbes Road TGIF on Saturday night and were totally disgusted with just about every aspect of this experience. One note 1st is you can't blame the server for just about everything but, it started with the noise, good Lord, it's supposed to be a restaurant/pub not a freakin disco. After walking around to try and pick the table with the fewest Bose speakers pointing at it we sat and then it began. It took an incredible amount of time for a round of wine & beers to arrive but finally they did, we orders the chicken nachos and the spinach and artichoke dip they came with the most disgusting ""nachos"" I have ever had, they were more like stale pita bread pieces and the chicken nachos were horrible, that was not chicken nope couldn't have been. Later after a few excuses about why it was taking so long, even tho the table next to us sat after us and were done eating before our meals even showed. The ribs they are known for sucked, way too dry probably because all our plates had been sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long. Two medium well down burgers were both rare and the side dishes were just as awful, mac & cheese with a crust, interesting but not edible.  We have dimes at the TGIF in Norwell a while back and it was definitely not in the suck category as Braintree is, so much for change, and he'll, no more coin flips on chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3?start=20,1.04,1.65,1.65,,1.4060000000000001
60,Chris D.,"Canton, MA",31,10,,2.0,2017-12-24,"Never a good impression on Christmas Eve when I walk in,  looking for a booth and the hostess walks past complaining she's still there and still another waitress is sitting down, complaining about her feet. I get it. It's the service industry and I've worked there. Still wildly unprofessional. My waitress was awesome but the first impression pretty much killed it for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3,1.08,1.63,1.63,,1.4100000000000001

79,Kathy N.,"Randolph, MA",0,2,,2.0,2018-01-07,"I've been to this particular TGIF many times and every time the service and wait time for anything is mediocre at best. There have been instances where I have come in and there were a lot of open tables but there was still a 15 minute wait with no other people waiting for a table. There have also been times where I have had to resort to sitting at the bar because the wait for a table was too long. This is where the service and wait time really get bad. I was with one other person yesterday and we weren't given any food or drink menus after sitting for about 10 minutes. We ended up having to ask the people who were getting up to leave if we could use their menus. After this, the bartender came and took our drink and food order at the same time. We got our beers about 5 minutes later (not bad at all) but the food took almost 1 hour to arrive. The food was very average and shouldn't have ever taken that long. I've experienced this at least three times now. Not sure if it's ever worth going again unless you have a lot of time to kill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-braintree-3,1.12,1.62,1.62,,1.4200000000000002
