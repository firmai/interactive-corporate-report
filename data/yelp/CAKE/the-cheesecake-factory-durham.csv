Stephanie S.,"Durham, NC",4,10,,4.0,9/19/2016,"Very pleasant experience in the Durham location.  This location is extremely busy and yet they provide excellent and timely service.  The food is very good considering it is a chain restaurant.  They provide a great ""healthy option"" menu.  Great location - walk across the the ""Streets"" and take in a movie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Radhika S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,,1.0,2/25/2017,"In the past, I have gone to this Cheesecake Factory and it has been really good. However, the last time I went was two years ago in December and the appetizers, cheesecake and some of the entrees tasted excellent however there was a problem. The problem was I had ordered a chicken and pasta dish (I can't recall the name) and the next day I woke up at 3 am and I was throwing up. I vomited constantly and I did not get any sleep that night. THE WORST PART WAS THIS WAS ON THE DAY OF MY BIRTHDAY! No one wants to spend their birthday with severe food poisoning.  I believe something had gone rank with the chicken and I called the restaurant and they did not even apologize. The lady just said, ""thanks for letting us know"" then she hung up. How rude? I have been to other Cheesecake Factory chains and I have had better.  I am never going to this Cheesecake Factory chain again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Brenda C.,"Wilmington, DE",138,267,1963,4.0,10/20/2014,"I suggest the cheesecake as your appetizer to make sure you have room for it. Maybe even have a couple of slices and just skip the rest of the meal. The Red velvet cheesecake is heavenly! I've tried a couple of other and they were all good, but red velvet is by far my favorite. As far as food goes, this is the kind of places that has so many options, but yet nothing is particularly appealing to me. The menu is a pretty thick book, I've been here a couple of times the only thing things are favorably memorable are the Chicken Madeira and the Gumbo (I enjoyed, though it wasn't like authentic gumbo). I once had this Asian salad that came with a very greasy wonton and was drenched in dressing, would've been better off eating a burger. Aside from that, the food is okay overall, not great, but not bad either. They bring you warm bread with butter when you sit so, I always look forward to that brown bread. It's a nice place to visit with a group since they have something for everyone on their menu and it's right by the movie theater. That being said, you can expect at least an hour wait on  Friday or Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Terry H.,"Euless, TX",43,437,221,4.0,10/15/2015,"Very good salads today.  Jon our server was very good and professional. Thanks Jon.

Grace H.,"Fayetteville, NC",367,29,19,3.0,7/24/2015,"Environment: If anything, I come here for the interior and service. The restaurant is huge and somehow always has a minimum of a 30 minute wait on the weekends (during dinner time). There were flies in the restaurant which was distasteful.  Food: Best thing is the bread that comes out for a starter. The last few times that we've been here the food has been a miss. My go-to is the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combination and the first time I'd had it, my mouth was watering for more. Recently, it just hasn't hit the spot. My family reacted in the same manner to their dishes (Tuscan Chicken and Fish Tacos). The Tuscan Chicken was dry and not marinated well, although the balsamic vinaigrette sauce is well-made. The fish tacos were not impressive at all, I'd recommend you don't order it at all. Hardly any fish, you're paying for lettuce and tasteless mini tortillas.  Service: Service is attentive but nothing spectacular. For the price I'm paying for these entrees, I expect a more professional and engaging service. Our table was missing silverware and small plates that all the tables should already have ready.  Overall, I honestly won't come again. I can get better service and food over at other places for a cheaper price. The only time I'll be coming here would be for their cheesecake but only if I'm actually willing to pay $7.95 for a single slice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Emily L.,"Thomasville, NC",0,11,4,5.0,7/11/2016,"I thought it was super expensive at first, but then when I actually tasted the food, I paid their prices happily. Service was great too.

Tori H.,"Charlotte, NC",503,523,290,4.0,7/26/2012,"You know, I know it's a chain, but I like it. I always get the same thing, and it's ALWAYS delicious! The service has always been decent to outstanding. We took my brother last night for his 18th birthday. Our server, Ebony, was fantastic. Always refilling our drinks promptly and she was very friendly (but not in a fake-waitress kind of way).  I got the chicken madeira and the cheesy goodness and the sauce with mushrooms...aaaah so good. The garlic red skin mashed potatoes were great too. So tasty. I can't imagine how much salt is on their food..........but whatev's.  We all got cheesecake and they sang happy birthday to my brother and they draw ""happy birthday"" in syrup on the plate. Nice touch. I always like places that take any extra step for someones birthday- especially when you are paying $$. The only thing that sucks is really the drink prices. I always want to get a few yummy cocktails- but that would be like a meal in itself for the cost. Not worth it. I can make a MUCH better authentic pina colada at home (and stronger ;) ) for a fraction of the $8-$10 you spend on one there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Adam S.,"Charlotte, NC",15,361,3,3.0,8/31/2015,"I find this Cheesecake Factory to be consistently worse than the one in Charlotte. Our most recent experience was on a Friday night, so naturally Southpoint was a total nightmare with people all over the place. The wait for Cheesecake was 40 minutes, and it took that long, maybe a little less. Once we were seated, our waitress came and took drink orders. I got up to go to the restroom and almost fell down because the floor was so slippery (not in the bathroom--in the restaurant itself!). Understand that I'm pretty in shape and don't usually fall, but I found myself walking very cautiously to avoid a fall. Not cool. Anyway, we got our bread after asking a few waiters, and our appetizers shortly thereafter. The ahi tuna was phenomenal, and the guacamole was good as well. I will say, though, that the heat was not spread in the guac evenly, so one bite was hot and the next wasn't. My meal was the SkinnyLicious steak with some veggies. It was pretty darn good. Not too much food, which was perfect for what I was expecting. I'd get it again. Service was really slow but very kind. Our waitress was so sweet but a little forgetful. The people at the cheesecake counter were great. I got the new Salted Caramel Cheesecake which was pretty good (I think red velvet is still better...). I'd probably still come back to this Cheesecake just because it's an easy thing to get, but it's really below the standard that should be set.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80

Carrie L.,"Raleigh, NC",0,65,9,3.0,5/8/2016,"This place is so overrated. I don't understand why people eat anything other than cheesecake here. I got the roasted vegetable salad, which had about 5 vegetables on a massive bed of iceberg lettuce.

Yeshanth J.,"Cary, NC",30,231,155,4.0,3/30/2015,"Cheesecakes and milkshakes are awesome. For those who like some alcohol in their cheesecakes, I would recommend the Kalhua Coffee Cheesecake. They serve the best Stuffed Mushrooms. I also like their Fresh Basil,tomato,cheese flatbread. Their dynamite shrimp is a meme attempt at PF Chang's Dynamite shrimp. Chocolate milkshake is just awesome ! Once you are done, drop an do 50 push ups and squats to not feel guilty :) I find this location better than the one in Crabtree valley mall. Better service and waiters with agreeable demeanor. Bottomline: Choose this versus the one in Raleigh !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80

Jamie R.,"White Post, VA",0,5,6,2.0,3/21/2015,Horrible. I would never go here again the person who got our take out of cheesecake stuck the white chocolate raspberry on something and left fingerprints in it. And then the strawberries for the shortcake had weird things mixed in and they were really overly ripe. All in all our service was horrible.

Jennifer H.,"Durham, NC",72,165,92,3.0,1/17/2016,"Hhhmmm so to be fair, I was not excited about going here for dinner, but I was out numbered and their menu is huge so I feel like something would be totally wrong if any human being wasn't able to find something to eat on their menu. Personally, I don't understand the draw to this place, but boy was it busy. I was the first to arrive for my party, checked in w the hostess and was told there would be a 30 minute wait-ok-not bad for 6pm on a Friday-but it was jam packed, people and servers everywhere. Standing room was very limited. After two minutes my buzzer went off and I was totally confused. Once at the hostess stand I said there must be a mistake I just got here and was told there was a 30 min wait and it's going off. I was told that an opening became available-um ok...texted my friend that was driving around looking for parking that I was already seated. I tell you all of this bc my initial thought was, y'all are unorganized! Once seated, our server was prompt and attentive, but not gonna lie, became annoying very quickly. It may be a good think that I forgot her name. From the second I sat down I felt like we were being rushed right out the door-not a feeling I like to have when I'm hoping for some r and r with a friend over a good meal. I find the menu to be a bit overwhelming. I ordered eggplant parm which came w a side of pasta w pesto. It was like Christmas in a plate because of the red and green contrast. The food was alright. Our servers constant checking in was beyond annoying-wishing that I could recall her name because I wasn't impressed with her. Our banana something or other cheesecake that my friend and I shared-wow!! In the future I'll be stopping by for the cheesecake only as the food and the service were just ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Adam W.,"Durham, NC",40,6,,5.0,1/21/2016,Everybody drops the ball once in a while. Tonight they actually did twice. I ordered the filet medium rare and I will pretty much never send a steak back. I actually had to do so twice tonight. The manager and our waitress were more than awesome about it and totally took care of us. It's not always easy to take my lovely wife out with our one and three year olds but they were exceptionally accommodating and more than made up for the trainee in the kitchen.

David L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",292,80,,4.0,9/4/2014,"It seems cheesecake is cheesecake wherever you are in the U.S. They have the same super-long menu and the same extensive cheesecake and drink menus. If you're indecisive, you will find yourself completely overwhelmed by the choice you have to make. Hopefully I can make your decision a bit easier: First of all, if you want some appetizers, definitely go with the fried calamari. DELICIOUS! My favorite pasta here by far is the bistro shrimp pasta: white sauce, with shrimp. My second favorite is the jambalaya: red, spicy sauce with different seafood. My friend got one of the salads here, and we were surprised to find that his dish was larger than any of the other dishes. Also, the steak diane is actually pretty good for a $20 steak dish. Cheesecakes are obviously good here: take your pick. They have pretty much every flavor you can think of for a cheesecake. Everything else is pretty self-explanatory. Overall, exactly what I expected: pretty good pasta and food, price is a bit high. David's VPP (Value Per Price): 6/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Samantha L.,"Potomac, MD",1910,1022,9453,4.0,11/30/2015,"After the mall closed for the night, my parents and I stopped by The Cheesecake Factory for some desserts. Our server Ryan N. was very friendly - he always ended everything he said with ""my friend"". For dessert, we shared a slice of White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. It was a brownie crusted filled with rich and creamy cheesecake swirled with white chocolate shavings and raspberry puree. It was served with flavorless whipped cream. We could never go wrong with this selection of this cheesecake. I liked how it wasn't too sweet. For beverages, my dad ordered a hot coffee while my mom ordered a Frozen Iced Mango and I ordered a Tropical Smoothie. It was nice that they offer complimentary refills on coffee. The Frozen Iced Mango consisted of mango, tropical juices, and a hint of coconut blended with ice, swirled with raspberry puree, and garnished with a strawberry. Similarly, the Tropical Smoothie consisted of mango, passion fruit, pineapple, and coconut blended with ice and garnished with a strawberry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=80
Adam B.,"Durham, NC",154,337,1043,4.0,9/26/2013,"So you know what you're getting when you come here, but consistency is a good thing. It's especially impressive that they manage to be so consistent with such a huge menu. They're not breaking any new culinary ground obviously, but they're doing the basics right. Aside from reliable food and a menu that will provide something for any diner, the two highlights here are location (just across from the movie theater, so great for a pre-show drink and snack) and a great staff, especially at the bar. They seem to have low turnover, so you'll see the same friendly folks often. I've tried lots of the dishes on the menu and they've all been good to very good. Particular favorites are the (unhealthy) Mexican egg roll (on the appetizer menu, but it will make a meal) and the pear and endive salad off the Skinnylicious menu. I didn't feel especially manly ordering the Skinnylicious salad, but it was really good and knowing that it was under 600 calories was a plus. In addition, it was a nice portion, which is a change from some low-cal menus where you get an ounce of food. Oh and best of all, they have Stone IPA on the beer list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=160

It was busy for a Monday night, probably due to it being Labor Day weekend. We waited 15-20 minutes and were seated & greeted by our server promptly.  She was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable of menu items on the extensive menu. Speaking of menu, it's overwhelming!  I ordered a draft beer, and had I known they charged $5.75 I would've thought twice about it. Ridiculously overpriced for a Fat Tire, if you ask me.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps (Asian style) from the ""Skinny-licious"" menu, and was very impressed with the flavor. It was a big enough serving to fill me up, it was well-prepared, and something I'd definitely order again. My friend had a few appetizers and seemed happy with her meal. We passed on the cheesecake, though I'm regretting that decision today! Based on my experience, I'd go back - which is a big improvement from last time I went.

But I couldn't resist echoing her disappointment. I've worked for a chain restaurant before, so I know they usually give the staff lots of standardized training - and our service was remarkably bad, particularly the situation his taking FOREVER for our checks and wasting time to complain to US about the process when he could have been spending that time hurrying to do it as quickly as possible.  That said, I am certain I will still have my Cheesecake Factory cravings. Unlike Rhea C., I drool over the very long and detailed cheesecake menu, imagining bites of each one until one sounds just right. So I will be back - but I hope the management reminds the staff that there are LOTS of good restaurants in Durham. So without good service, the wait at Cheesecake is going to get much shorter.

I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factories over the years and I've never been disappointed by their food.  The only thing that turns me off about this place is the fact that they don't do reservations and the wait is always long unless you come at odd hours, and even then, it can still be a long wait sometimes.  However, I think the long wait is a good testament of how good their food is.  I used to have a friend that worked at a Cheesecake factory, so I had the opportunity to try every cheesecake there.  Well, 30 out of 32 at least.  I didn't bother trying their low carb ones because like I said, if you're counting calories or counting carbs, why  bother?  I'm a big fan of their banana cream cheesecake and I don't even like bananas that much!   I think the dessert that doesn't get enough attention here is their strawberry shortcake.  My significant other isn't much of a cheesecake person like I am, so he usually opts for that instead.  Believe me when I say that it's the kind of dessert you need to share.  It's a mountain of strawberries, shortcake, fresh whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  Deeeelish! Out of all the dishes I've tried here, my favorite is the bistro shrimp pasta.  It's phe-nom-enal!  Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce....need I say more?  For those of you who love avocados, the avocado eggroll appetizer is really good.   Don't be scared of the long line when you come here, it's worth the wait, I promise :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=160

The food wasn't cooked properly the service was horrible. It took them 10 minutes just to get our drinks ordered, not to the table but to tell them what we would like to drink. We finally place our orders for then 15 min later be told that they are out of the appetizer to order something else. Our pasta entrees were not cooked completely, bland no flavor what so ever. The table next Us Barely ate anything and left most of their food behind. Our waitress barely came to our table had to wait a while to ask for our checks and wait another while just to pay, but another table next to us had a different waiter got their checks and paid   While we were waiting to pay. I asked for the manager, it took a while for him to come over to our table as well. After we explained how horrible everything was he though that giving us cheesecake would make everything thing okay. We paid and left only to meet my cousin outside who also brought her children for one of their birthdays.

The hostess quoted ""5-10 minutes"" but after waiting 25 we gave up. They blamed it on the fact that they only had two bussers for the tables...well guess what? Somebody (a manager, server, one of the useless hosts standing around) needs to go bus tables if you want to keep your patrons. But honestly, we all knew that was a lie, right?

Unfortunately, my family's experience at the Durham restaurant the other night was really disappointing. My mother and I both ordered salads and hers was TINY and barely had any meat in it. Mine was missing corn, black beans, and DRESSING. We had to stalk down the waitress to tell her what was happening and then she asked if she should just bring me a side of black beans. Um, no? I sent it back, which is unusual for me, and the salad I got back was much larger and much more delicious, leading me to think that the particular chef who made our salads the first time just sucked.

There is definitely a lot of hype over this place which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars. They have a pretty large menu, but too much is really too much. As an indecisive person, it already takes me awhile to decide what I want and the pages of menu items is a bit overwhelming. Their drinks aren't that great considering the cost, definitely not returning for their drinks. I did, however, enjoy their skinny menu--not necessarily because I'm watching my weight but because they're smaller portions of food which is nice and leaves room for their cheesecake! Definitely save room for the cheesecake! I'm not really a fan of cheesecake to begin with but they have different flavors which helps to please all different taste buds. Overall, I'd go here again if I was shopping in the area, but it's not really a destination restaurant for me.

Michael G.,"Seattle, WA",7,285,,1.0,12/9/2016,"Typically consistency would be one of the primary expectations I would have for any Cheesecake branch within the large national chain.  Well, this branch has ruined that expectation.  Two visits ago, my wife and I both came down with stomach trouble the early evening after eating lunch at this restaurant.  I suspected a linkage because we always shared our dishes at this restaurant. Then, on our last visit, one of the meals served from the kitchen was absolutely hideous in terms of really poor meat quality that was way oversized and not cut anywhere close to the usual standard size for the dish.  It was extremely gristly and unusually overloaded with large chunks of fat.  We both were lucky that we did not choke on the gross meat that we ultimately had to spit out onto the plate.   It was totally inexcusable, disgusting, and it has completely destroyed my trust in the kitchen there, to serve something so obviously bad like that to customers. I have never seen such large variation in quality at a cheesecake factory branch before.  I am very sad that I will have to stay away from a chain I have liked for many years due to the very poor kitchen performance and substandard quality at this branch.  The disappointment in the poor food quality was actually so big that we could not even accept any offers to try to fix it.  When a restaurant messes up so bad, I just do not want to even give them another chance.  I care too much about my health and well being.  I also share the disappointment in the management of this branch like other customers, as they did not seem to adequately listen to me or meet my expectations in handling the very unfortunate quality issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=60

We came here in all honesty after intending to go to California Pizza Kitchen and not finding it, then being bombarded with a random quick heavy downpour.  Don't get me wrong, their food is good, and I was glad to find their skinnylicious menu, only because I know their normal plates REALLY pack the calories if you're not careful. We had a 15 minute wait initially, which we spent browsing next door at lululemon. Once seated, our server for the rest of the evening, Ashley, was incredible. So courteous, attentive, friendly, smiled, interactive, and cracking jokes. She was always on top of refilling our drinks - we never saw the bottom! I had the Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos, the husband had their skinnylicious chicken pasta. The lettuce wraps were delicious. I preferred the sweet and spicy sauce over their peanut ginger one. Good crunch from the veggies, the lettuce wrap didn't fall apart, and the grilled chicken was flavorful. The husband said his chicken pasta wasn't anything special, but he said it at least had the tang he was looking for. The house brown bread is amazing. If I wasn't watching calories, I easily could've had two loafs by myself! It's got a sweet hint in it that just makes your mouth water.

Drinks came out quickly, meanwhile our avo egg rolls we ordered as an app never came.  20 minuets after we order our drink she came back to the table and asked us if she took our order and what we had ordered.  At that point we knew she forgot about us.  Our drinks were finished at the time and she never offered us to order another pina colada.  Another 20 minutes go by and she asked us what our app was again and if it had come out.  10 minutes later our food came, no appetizer.  10 minutes into the meal she finally came around and asked if our food was ok and I mentioned to her our app never came.  She apologized and blamed it on the back of the house.  Asked me if I still wanted it and made us seem like it was an issue to take it off.  (WTH) at this point I wanted to speak to the manager but none were in sight.  We ask for the check and she says.  Just want to let you know I took your Mac and cheese balls off... I never ordered those. I ordered avo rolls.  Seriously terrible.  Next time I'll order take out. Update: I would have spoken to a manager if I could have found one.  Secondly I had my impatient and tired 4 year old with me and was unable to wait for another 30 minutes to speak with said manager.  I worked at a CCF in college so I know how my experience should have gone and I was appalled that ticket times were unmanaged and lack of responsibility taken from the waitress.  She should have notified her manager that she made the mistake and asked for a rush.

Saturday late lunch service was busy but we got a table quickly. Bread was good just like I remembered. Should have just stuck to bread and strawberry lemonade. Boy is that refreshing! We went with the avocado egg rolls on the recommendation of our waitress. They were ok. They are very salty and the sauce is very sweet. Kind of a rollercoaster ride for the tastebuds. Due to the preparation of them, the ends stay way too hot for a long time and the other side will be cold by that point. We had fun with the crispy rice noodles that garnished the plate though.  Entree was where I went horribly off track. I went with the chicken maderas based on internet reviews and seeing that it is the most popular chicken dish. This dish was very bland unless you had a bite with the cheese. The mushrooms were flavorless. The mashed potatoes were gummy. The chicken itself was nicely pounded and battered.

Joshua W.,"Hillsborough, NC",0,11,,1.0,3/9/2017,"Tonight my fiancé and I decided to have a lovely date night and discuss details for our upcoming wedding. My fiancé arrived early first to get us a table and have our appetizer and drink ready as I was working late and on the way. He requested for us to have a booth table, however the hostess then informed him that there were no booth tables available and we could be seated either at a bar high top or at the happy hour table. Disappointed, but understanding, he selected the high top bar table only to discover that many booth tables were available.  He was able to identify a manager and asked why he was told no booth tables were available for our preference and sat at a small bar high top. Right when I was arriving, the manager was surprised and happy to accommodate us to our preferred seat. She was glad to help.  The hostess began expressing much attitude and physically gesturing toward us while talking about us to a group of employees causing us to feel uncomfortable and quite frankly unwanted for our service. The manager came over and we kindly asked for her to please correct the situation as it was beginning to escalate and cause discomfort. The manager did pull her off the floor but eventually came back.  Silver lining, our waitress, Ifey, was an amazing superstar and make sure we were happy entertained and comfortable donating the night. We could not have been happier with her attention to us.  The reason I am providing a review of one star is because the manager never came back to check on us after the situation happened. There was no courtesy discount provided, though we did not expect to have one.  It sends us the message that the hostess' behavior was acceptable. It questions our loyalty as frequent diners to our favorite restaurant moving forward.

Lauren R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,121,204,3.0,3/12/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always good, but if you ask me it's a little overrated. It's location is ideal at Southpoint Mall, and it is one of the better options to eat at the mall. The inside is huge and dark, and the outdoor seating is perfect for the warm spring and summer nights. Beware of the wait times here on the weekends. I'm pretty sure every time I have been, there's always a wait. Depending on how big your party is, the waiting time usually goes by quick and there's plenty to walk around and see while waiting at the mall.  The menu is huge. This is definitely one of those places where I stick to the same order every time, simply because I do not want to look through the menu. My usual is the Asian chicken salad, which never disappoints. The salad is HUGE. I usually have enough left over to last me for two more meals. They give a lot of chicken and peanuts, and the sesame Asian salad dressing is delicious.  Last night, I went with an order of the avocado egg rolls to share, and I changed it up with the chopped Cobb salad, without the bacon. The avocado egg rolls are delicious. A must order appetizer. They're crunchy, and the avocado is fresh and tasty. To make it even better, they serve it with an avocado dipping sauce dressing that was so good. My salad was good, but I liked my usual Asian salad better. It had a lot of apples and blue cheese in it, and the lettuce was shredded which I liked. The chicken pieces were small and there wasn't that much meat in the salad.  The service here isn't the quickest. The waitress was nice about it though and said the kitchen was a little slow several times and assured us the food would be out soon. However, a salad is so quick to make so I'm not sure what took so long.  My favorite part of dining here is the bread. The brown bread they serve is delicious!

While there was no wait to seat (unheard of at Cheesecake Factory), the service was slower than usual and was not as personable as it usually is. The menu is very expansive and you can find many things to eat here, so that is always a plus. I enjoyed my brunch and my wife enjoyed the veggie burger (as did I!). This place is expensive for our wallets but I am happy to go with a gift card.

Jocelyn Y.,"Chico, CA",183,148,1040,3.0,9/30/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory was the most disappointing one I've been to. It seemed very unorganized and slow. There was a line of people at the front asking how much longer their wait would be while I waited in line just to put my name on the list.  It took forever for our waitress to come by and we didn't start eating until more than an hour after we were seated. In the mean time, in between time, we asked for bread three times because we were starving. The food was good tho. I got one of those combinations that came w the steak and herb crusted salmon. Portions were super small compared w the action dishes so I probably wouldn't get a combo ever again but I suppose it was nice to try two things. It was REALLLYYY dim in this restaurant. Like I could barely see my menu or what I was eating. SO who knows if my steak was cooked how I wanted it and who knows what I was actually eating. While waiting for our food I had a nice little view of the kitchen where food sat forever before people would bring it out to the tables.

Eggplant came with five small medallions and was quite tasty.  The fettuccine alfredo always is a crowd pleaser and be sure to get the lunch portion as it is huge! The Cobb salad was a big hit. It was actually large enough to share for the entire table of four.  Good variety and fresh options on the Cobb.  The nachos were quite tasty as well.  Unfortunately, we all wanted to try the cauliflower steak on cous could with spinach and fontina. Alas it was sold out.  Leave off the fontina and it seems like it could be a very nice vegan option.   Of course the cheesecakes delighted all!! Awesome service by Ryan and Missy.  Perhaps the best we have ever had here!!! November 2017 update: they no longer even offer the cauliflower option. Also, they are either unable or unwilling to price adjust their salads when the meat is removed. Perhaps they don't realize that vegans and vegetarians are a growing and significant segment of our country.  We need more options not less.  We can't live on (cheese) cake alone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham

Went with my girlfriend and her kids, and their first question was ""why is it so *dark* in here??"" I know a lot of restaurants maintain a dim atmosphere for... reasons? But it was stupidly dark in the restaurant. Asked the host, and they were just like ""um, because it's on a timer?""  We were seated quickly, but service was silly slow. We told the server that our movie was at 7, and they even mentioned it later so I know they didn't forget. They just did a terrible job of returning to the table. Very pleasant, but not really attentive. The restaurant was busy, so maybe she had too many tables - but we were irked that she mentioned she knew we were on a timetable, but didn't drop off the check in anything like a timely fashion.  Asked another waiter, they dropped off the check - and then sprinted away before we could hand a credit card to pay! Host said they couldn't handle money, so they paged our original server.  Food is OK, not fantastic. I will say Cheesecake Factory does pretty well with their food given the diversity of the menu.  Previous visit, I went for brunch and the service was terrible then as well. Doubt we'll be back.

When first arriving, the hostesses asked my sister and I if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We were going to sit outside until we were told there would probably be a lot of flies on the patio. My sister and I were sat next to a huge window where there were still flies buzzing around. I saw one dead on the window seal next to me. The hostess explained that the windows have a treatment on them that kill insects.  We ordered a couple of appetizers including the Dynamite Shrimp the Factory Nachos. We sent the shrimp back because it was overcooked. By this time, the flies became absolutely unbearable so we asked the hostess to move us. She told us that more than likely there would still be flies wherever we sat, which was a huge problem in itself. She moved us near a booth closer to the inside of the restaurant and near the kitchen. There were still flies but not as many.

I like the colurful cieling paitings. Plenty of nice outdoor seating. Our table was a bit dirty, when we asked our server to clean it he just wiped it off with a napkin from another table as opposed to cleaning it properly. There are too many menu options on three different menus! It would take me an hour to properly read through the menu. Two types of complimentary bread served before the meal. The dark bread is good.  The chicken and shrimp dish with pineapple and light honey flavoured batter was very good, mixed with snow peas and shittake mushrooms. But for a dish with pineapple in the name, there probably should have been more pineapple pieces. Everything else was great about this dish and the portion was so big I took half of it home, which I hardly ever do. Unlike others, I don't think Cheesecake Factory is overpriced, depending on what you pick from the menu you can find some affordable options around 12 dollars. The burger bun for the turkey burger was burnt, badly on one side. A little bit dry meat and the mushrooms were missing. Mayo was good and the fries a lot better than the average fries.  For an angel hair pasta dish, asked for bacon to be removed and replaced with mushrooms instead. The server charged 1.50 dollars extra without informing us. Not cool. Mango Key Lime Cheesecake (with vanilla coconut macaron crust) had lot of flavour. Soo good! I counted the types of cheesecake on the menu and found a total of 33 different cheese cakes. Double espresso took a long time and came only when I was half way done with my cheesecake.

Yvonne C.,"Nashville, TN",203,229,86,3.0,9/2/2015,"As far as chain restaurants go, this probably fills the bill for your average one. This Cheesecake Factory is huge, seats a lot of people, has outdoor seating, and yet is crazily packed during peak times (weekends, holidays).  I eat here out of convenience whenever I'm shopping at Southpoint, waiting for a movie, or if friends want to eat here and it's never been disappointing, but nothing awe-striking. Like all CFs, the menu is EXPANSIVE!! You could go for days in that menu, and if you're indecisive like me, then oh boy, buckle up. There is literally something for everyone.  The bread that comes out before your meal is actually really good! I tend to fill up on the bread by accident here, ha!  I usually go for the bowtie pasta with the chicken (don't remember the actual name), because I know it's good and it's cheap. It's a very heavy dish because it's drenched in a creamy sauce. The portions are huge! I usually split a dish with my BF. If you have room for dessert, then please do get a slice of cheesecake. And one slice is perfect for 2! All the ones I've ever tried are so delicious and dense.  The service here is alright, it can get a bit slow and we've had a forgetful waitress in the past. We ordered a beer and it never came out, which the waitress repeatedly apologized for. If you're just curious about the cheesecake or having a craving, you can order slices at the counter by the entrance.

Husband ordered parmesan herb crusted chicken and I ordered the combination plate of chicken madeira and steak diane. The egg roll sampler was great with 4 different types with sauces.

After being seated it seemed like it took over 10 minutes for our server Kenneth to come acknowledge us. At that time we placed our drink order and an appetizer order to help move things along and prevent longer delays. After Kenneth returned with out drinks he took our order.  A while later a food server dropped our appetizer off for us to enjoy which actually was good. We had the fried mozzarella. Then we never saw our server for a very long time. Our drinks needed refills and we had been finished with our appetizer for quite some time and started wondering where our food was.

Since our server was not attentive to our table we couldn't inquire what the holdup was.   Finally after almost 30 minutes a good runner came to deliver meals to the table to our right which they had been finished and we're waiting on the same server to bring them their bill. I heard the order and said I ordered that and she said no it's for this table. They advised her she was wrong they were waiting on their bill and she proceeded to drop the order on our table when they got my wife's order wrong. So she picked up the order and said she would recheck where this was going but asked what my wife ordered.  Finally Kenneth showed up to the table finished eating and we inquired about our order and explained the mess up. He was like oh let me check on it. I also asked at that time for refills and Said the people to our left already received their meals and said not sure what's up. Then it fell apart from there.  Kenneth started to make smart remarks to me and I said you can bring the manager over and one was walking by and he called the gentleman over. I advised him that Kenneth hasn't been doing his job and attentive to his tables. The manager said this was the first he heard of this and would check on our order. Kenneth came back to refill our drinks and said you must be thirsty and he was here to refill our drinks since he hasn't been doing anything tonight. I said you can find us another service and to watch his smart remarks I was out to enjoy a dinner not have poor service.  Needless to say our night was ruined by poor customer no service at this location. My wife enjoyed her meal I can't say the same. The manager never came back to apologize or offer anything to us. We paid our bill and will NEVER eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=40

Someone said their menu changed a bit so I went. Overwhelming amount of choices on the menu is a decoy. Chicken takes up 75% of their menu..anyways overall, pretty okay.  Pasta is a safe choice while steak was not the best idea.  Their cheese cake is goooood. We had the chocolate s'mores.

After getting our order, we asked an employee if we could sit at a table to eat it. Even though there was no one waiting in line to eat and there were empty tables available, we were denied access. The female who denied us a place to sit said that we could not eat at a table because we purchased the cheesecake ourselves rather than having a waiter/waitress bring it to us. If my husband and I had known we would have received such poor service, we definitely would not have stopped at this restaurant.

Very elegant decor. We enjoy the complementary bread basket and the pumpernickel bread specifically. You must try the avocado eggrolls and order double tamarind sauce for dipping. It is amazing and we order this every time. I skip around the menu as it's so large and there are so many delicious choices. The pasta carbonara is my favorite pasta choice. It's huge! I have to say though, my all time favorite dish is the hibachi ribeye! It is beyond perfection! Medium rare, seasoned flank steak, covered in marinated and sauteed mushrooms, onions, sprouts and cilantro. Sweet Asian inspired sauce and mashed potatoes with wasabi butter on top. It is mouth-watering! This is one of my and my husband's favorite date spots. Kids are welcome but we opt not to bring ours. We normally don't have room for cheesecake but the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake is amazing. The chocolate torte (not sure that's what it's called... chocolate cake. Maybe?) is my favorite dessert here. It's thick, moist, creamy and huge! It's not fluffy cake, it's more like a torte. Delicious!

Rhea C.,"Newton, MA",6,10,,3.0,5/29/2010,"I know it's a chain, but I usually get soooo excited to go to the Cheesecake Factory! I mean, who doesn't love the bread basket and the insane portions?? Although kind of a nightmare for dieters, I really enjoy their Chinese Chicken Salad and Barbecue Chicken Salad, and the lunch size portions are fairly reasonable, calorie-wise. I love dessert but cheesecake is actually NOT my favorite (gasp!) so if I'm going to splurge I order the strawberry shortcake, and it's amazing. A real, honest-to-goodness biscuit, ice cream, whipped cream, and of course, fresh strawberries. It really does remind me of the shortcake my mom used to make.  Despite my long-standing love, recent experiences at the Southpoint Cheesecake have led to some conflicting feelings. They seem to be cutting corners - like using mostly iceberg lettuce in the salads, and skimping on the strawberries in the strawberry shortcake - so wrong!And THEN I had a  terrible experience with a waiter there. I'm still a little shocked at his attitude. He was rude to us, right from the beginning, and really slow. My friend and I split a salad, and we had to ask three times for an extra plate. Then the process of getting the bill was a debaucle. He knew we were trying to get to a movie, and yet everything was so slow it was almost as if he was trying to make us late. We told him we were ready for the checks, and he went off, presumably to get on that . . .  but no - 10 minutes later, he wandered by and asked if we needed separate checks. Another 10 minutes went by, and when we asked for an update, he informed us, in a clearly annoyed tone, that separate checks took a long time, and we were just going to have to wait. Um, I'm not really looking to be scolded by a 23 year-old waiter on my girls night out! I'd have to say I'm still a fan of the Cheesecake fare, but I'll probably think twice about the Southpoint branch, especially since there are so many options in the area.

I shared a Thai Lettuce Wraps app with a couple of people and it was absolutely delicious. It was recommended to me by a friend who goes to the Cheesecake Factory a lot as the one of the best appetizers and she was definitely on the money. There were enough wraps and ingredients to make 6 wraps and my manager had it as an entree just to give you an idea of the portion sizes.  I had the Rib Eye and Mashed Potatoes for an entree and unfortunately I was very very underwhelmed by the Rib Eye, hence the reluctant 3 star rating. But the Mashed Potatoes were absolutely heavenly. I'm sure it's because it's loaded with butter but I would definitely recommend it. The portion was also big enough for 3 meals. I got the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake, but I think the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake or Tower Cake is better. From previous experiences, I'd also recommend the Herb Crusted Salmon and Chicken Madeira.  The Southpoint location was very empty for lunch, but it definitely gets crowded at dinner time. We got excellent service and our waiter was funny to boot. The bill was pretty high for lunch but I always think that the portion size at the Cheesecake Factory justifies the price tag.

Lys L.,"Fayetteville, NC",1,57,3,1.0,6/19/2016,"Let me start by saying CF is my favorite restaurant chain. I went here every week when I lived in Hawaii. I moved here and tried this location and was very very disappointed. My cousin was in town on vacation and it was her first night. We want here. My husband and I got our food and then 5 mins later she got hers. She asked for a medium well steak, cut into it and it was pure blood . The waiter asked if he could take the steak and go cook it more. It was already burnt on the outside but the inside was blood. She need a whole new steak . He seemed he had an issue with trying to get her a whole new steak done the right way and she wanted new sides as well(so they would not get cold) It took 30 mins. My Hubby and I did not want to eat our food while she waited on her new plate. Our food was then cold waiting for her food. There is. I reason why it should take that long. It should of been on the fly. We wanted a nice dinner and they ruined it. But that's not the end . My husband ordered the Jamaican plate and it was missing the platanos (my husband told the waiter, he didn't even know ) my plate came out with Coleslwa when I told the waiter not to include it, but I still got it.  The waiter did not ask if we even wanted to speak to a manager after all this, so I had to ask. She came to apologize and it was not really sincere in my opinion. I guess she apologiez for the food, but she didn't realize that they ruined the whole night. She took off the steak plate off the Menu and gave my husband a free cheesecake . I feel that my whole meal should of been free because this was the worst team restaurant experience of my life and that sad part is is that it was at my fav place to eat. I hope this goes to corporate. If not I will just email them myself .

Janice M.,"Summerfield, NC",183,122,168,2.0,9/8/2014,"First time at this chain and was a bit disappointed. Let me start by saying the space is beatiful! We had the friend mac and cheese balls with creamy marinara sauce, SkinnyLiciousAsian chicken salad and the grilled shrimp and bacon club. The mac and cheese was very good, The salad was mostly shredded greens with little of the other ingredients evident. The chicken was bland and a bit chewy, liked the dressing. IMO, this is WAY overpriced. The grilled shrimp club was basically two sandwiches, HUGE, but again overpriced. We spent $47 on lunch without drinks.

The waitress was also really sweet and refilled our bread whenever she saw that our basket was empty. The ambiance was really nice, but the wait for seating was excruciatingly long (we found out later that the kitchen apparently got backed up on orders).

Marvin S.,"Durham, NC",9,40,3,2.0,5/7/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory, the halllowed halls of the world renowned cheesecake. We've all heard the stories of their fine cuisine and their better-than-sex desserts. I used to go to the one in Raleigh (Glenwood Ave locale) and it was decent, not bad. So I was in the neighborhood at Southpoint last night, date night with the wife. Dinner and a movie, thought we'd start at TCF. I read reviews prior to goingm as I was curious, this being my first time at this location. One reviewer mentioned that their waiter never smiled. So after we arrived and waited 15 minutes for our table, we were finally seated. The person who escorted us, some goofy six foot tall lug of a guy with the personality of a potted palm and never smiled. For a matter of fact, as I watched the employees... sunnuvagun, there were few people who smiled. I know there were easily 10 waiers/servers, a few busboys, and a manager who seemed to look through people instead of smiling and greeting the customers in passing. No smiles... dangnest thing I have seen, So anyway we were seated at our table. First thing I noticed was the table as dirty. No no, not dirty plates on the table, I mean grime and filth on the table! Encrusted with the last ten people's food or whatever. That was gross! I took some of the water from my water glass, dipped my napkin in it and cleaned the table myself. But I wrote this off as them being busy. Afterall, this is THE Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the burger, but I wanted something else but was afraid, due to our time crunch, something beyond a burger may through the kitchen in a panick and delay my food by half an hour. So I did a burger and mashed potatoes (can't stand greasy fries!). My wife ordered the salad with grilled chicken. I should take a moment to spotlight the only bright spot in my experience... Jazmine. She was a delight. Smiled, very personable, she was the only reason we did not just get up and leave. IMO, try to get in Jazmine's area when you visit, she and one other waitress were the only ones who seemed to smile and was pleasant. And believe me, I was watching! We were there for 45 minutes, and of everyone there, only two peope... sorry, I was going on a tangent. My burger was a crispy critter when it came out (24 minutes after ordering). It came on a wheat bun, which was ok. All of the necessary condiments and accrumon was right. My wife's salad was wrong....how do you mess up a grilled chicken salad? They forgot the chicken. So tack on another minute or two for the lovely and takented Jazmine to go back there, kick their rocks to get some chicken as ordered! We also got the dessert... and one would seriously hope they couldn't muck up their signature dish. We got the low carb cheese cake, with a side of strawberries (fresh) and whipped cream (made there?). All delicious as it should be.  As I was paying the check, i Noticed the guy at the next table left and the busboy came and cleared off the table before resetting. But wait.... one tiny little thing was missed. He never washed the table, not a single wet rag, spray bottle, nothing. Just took the plates and such away, then set it back up with another set of plates, glasses, etc.  No wonder our table was cruded up... unclean.... because they do not clean the tables! GROSS! Upside to the experience: Jazmine The Cheesecake Downside... everything else! Change management, because obviously management is unaware or just dont care. They set the standard, they set the example and from what I saw from the management, they need to clean house...

Kurt H.,"Raleigh, NC",19,107,68,3.0,5/6/2014,"It's the Cheesecake Factory.  A massive menu with portions to match.  My wife enjoys eating here. And I do not.  It's not that the food isn't acceptably good to very good, depending on the entree (and by that, I mean only one entree: The Hibachi steak. A big hand for the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Marinated Hanger Steak...one of the few entrees that's good,even if you take home leftovers). The ambiance is cold and uninviting, the seating is uncomfortable, and the clientele can tend toward the juvenile. We were lucky enough to be seated next to a bratty party of 13-15 year olds whose parents either didn't know/didn't care that they weren't ready for presentation to the general public yet. Or maybe they did, because all ten of them were there without adult supervision. The service is OK to meh, all around.  Combined with the price, there are other places that I'd rather eat, even if their menus don't resemble a large, hardbound novel. The cheesecakes are very good. The Mango and the Red Velvet cheesecake deserve special mention here. Just get it to go, though. It's not worth the wait or the cost, unless you are just in love with a chain.

Look, I'm not trying to sound snobby or elitest, but quite frankly the cost of sub-par chain food is way more expensive than the flavorful local-grown stuff. My friend has a 3 year old, so she wanted to go somewhere close to the mall that offered a kid's menu.   I'll just make a list of things that annoy me about this place: 1)  The ""buzzer"" went off, indicating our table was ready.  We proceeded to the Hostess Podium.  Our table was not, in fact, ready, so we were left standing there.  Right in the way.  And trying to keep a 3 year old still is like keeping 40 corks under water all at once.  It was awkward and agitating.  2)  It smells like a wet dish towel in there.  3)  Crumbs on my seat.  Host made no effort to wipe them off, so I did so myself with the extra linen sitting on our table.   4) Portions are ridiculously huge.  Not practical at all.  5)  Our server was pretty good, but the food runner ""auctioned off"" the food.  Unprofessional.  I was a server for years.  You know which plate belongs to which person.  Pretty unpractical to put a jumbo Ceasar salad in front of a 3 year old.  6) ""Jumbo"" is the best way to describe the ""lunch"" portion.  7)  Food Runner #2 showed up with ""kid's portion"", which was also jumbo.  She put it in front of said kid with a ramekin of mayonnaise on the side.  Inevitably the mayonnaise falls off the plate and onto the floor.  8)  The food runner didn't offer more napkins, nor anything else to wipe said mayo off the floor, so of course yours truly steps upon it.  9)  Overpriced 10) Loud 11) This one may qualify as hear-say, but I've heard that they have downgraded their ingredients as a cost-saving measure.  It tastes like it.  12) I hate their ""sister restaurant"", PF Changs too.    This place sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=100

Rebecca T.,"Durham, NC",1,2,,1.0,4/5/2015,"Really unimpressed with my dinner this evening. LOADS of flies infesting the place, cold food, waitresses MIA and disinterested management. My niece and I stopped in for an early dinner around 4pm and were ready to order almost immediately, but the waitress kept inexplicably walking away. I asked for water, and was about to give our order, but she walked away to get the water. While she was doing that, my niece said she wanted a cherry soda. When she got back with the water, I asked if they had cherry soda. She offered a Shirley Temple, which was fine by me. Then she walked away again before I could order the food we wanted. THEN when she got back with my niece's drink, I asked if that could be considered the soda for the kids' meal. She said yes, and it came with refills - great! I ended up switching my order to the Miso Salmon on her recommendation, which was just okay, definitely not great. The food took a really long time to arrive for such a non-busy time, especially given how little time it takes to  cook salmon. My niece actually fell asleep while we were waiting, after trying unsuccessfully to shoo several flies away from our table. My fish was lukewarm at best when it arrived at the table, though my niece loved her (huge) serving of mac & cheese. I asked our waitress for an extra order of snow peas on the side because I'd assumed the notation ""with snow peas"" in the menu meant a serving of snow peas, not five peas for garnish, as it turned out. My peas never came. Neither did I get a chance to ask for a lemon wedge for my fish, which was a little bland in addition to being cold. My niece's drink had also been empty and awaiting a refill for some time. I was practically standing up on the bench looking for the waitress, who was nowhere in sight, though I saw other waiters appear and disappear a few times. We actually ended up leaving our table because the flies were getting more numerous, and I heard other diners commenting as well. When she finally came back I just asked for a box and the check, though I'd planned to get a cocktail and share a dessert with my niece when I walked in, and even just that took a while. I asked to speak to a manager as a left, who gave me lip service and took off the price of the kids' meal as a courtesy, though I noticed afterwards that the Shirley Temple had been charged in addition to the kids's meal instead of being counted as the drink. I did not feel that she really listened to my concerns about all the flies or the non-attendant service, and just fed me a whole bunch of canned lines like, ""I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am"" with a tight smile and glazed eyes. I've had okay experiences here before, but never a great one, and this was my first REALLY BAD experience.

We had to ask or remind them the adults hadn't ordered.  Took over 30 mins to get our cheesecakes we ordered and check.  I understand it was our choice to eat at a place with a large party without a reservation but the poor service and the lack of any ""service recovery"" for this horrible experience is inexcusable. The only redeeming factor is that the food was good. They were however out of ribeye steaks and captain Morgan so a couple guys in our party were even more upset than I was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Angella L.,"Durham, NC",0,16,2,5.0,3/20/2015,"Dined in almost every time because the experience is worth it. All the servers I've had were good to amazing, friendly and attentive. I would recommend any of the pasta dishes, and for appetizers, the avocado egg rolls, and mac and cheese balls. Also the free bread is nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Andrew R.,"Durham, NC",57,88,,1.0,8/14/2012,"I'd give it 4 stars for the atmosphere and the way the food tastes, but, every time I've eaten here, I get sick.  I get violently sick.  In all likelihood it's just me. Like I said, the food tastes good, and I'd give it 4 stars without thinking twice if my system would just agree with it. I honestly suggest checking it out, with the understanding that it's a known quantity, and it will please most palates.  But, if you, like me, get sick afterwards, you might consider avoiding the chain altogether.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Bill P.,"Chapel Hill, NC",23,24,,2.0,6/12/2015,"Let me first say that I have been to Cheesecake Factory several times and I am always pleased with my meal, the service, etc.  I normally would give them 4 stars.  Last night was different.  Service was poor and, more importantly, the food was horrible.  We order the Thai lettuce wraps and fish tacos -- thoroughly disappointing.  We've had the lettuce wraps before and they changed the recipe.  Everything lacked taste and was incredibly bland.  We left very disappointed and might not return given the prices are still quite high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Chris H.,"Cary, NC",4,117,1,4.0,8/31/2013,Really enjoyed my Warm asparagus salad.  It is a new menu item and it was very good as I was freezing that evening.  I also had Irish coffee (very good) and the soup of the day - can you sense a theme here.   My husband had one of the Salmon Salads which he enjoyed but next will get the normal meal as he felt like there was just too much lettuce. Our server was great -she was very attentive and very sweet.  We went late on a Friday night (10PM) and did not have to wait at all - however we did get seated very close to another couple. The place is decorated very nicely and everything is very clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Sarah B.,"Durham, NC",87,44,31,5.0,11/7/2014,"My husband took me here to eat after a tough week. It never disappoints. Our waiter, Ryan, was amazing, attentive, and incredibly kind. The food was incredible. I had the fish and chips for my entree and it was delicious. I also got a tasty peach Bellini. I got a slice of caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. It's my favourite and always amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Danielle R.,"Greensboro, NC",46,381,145,5.0,4/15/2013,Thai lettuce wraps..that's all I can say. I get them EVERY time I go because they are so good and I have leftovers too (or I share them with someone else). The bacon lentil soup is also fantastic! I just wish we had this place in Greensboro!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Vicky C.,"Durham, NC",2,17,1,3.0,1/26/2013,"I like The Cheesecake Factory primarily for having a ""skinny menu"", it's hard to eat out and eat healthy but here you can do both.  Last week Saturday we were looking for a late dinner as we just flew into town from the west coast. Because of the generous hours we managed to get seated and have a lovely dinner just after midnight.  I can only give this location 3 stars because twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner, I've had a chicken salad with crunchy rice. It must have been old and dried out. Not tasty. Otherwise I like the atmosphere and the menu, and the late hours, and the occasional  (shared) cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
Dan M.,"Wake Forest, NC",1,13,8,1.0,6/17/2014,"Was only able to make it to one star because I never got a chance to try the food. Arrived with the family (4), it was quiet not very busy on a Tue afternoon. However, we were asked to wait while a table was prepared and were given a pager. We proceeded to check out the cheesecakes. After almost 10 mins we started wondering what was going on, when we noticed people walking in and getting seated right away. It appears that the hostess forgot all about us.  We opted to walk next door to Firebirds, a much better decision. Customer service was MUCH better there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-durham?start=120
