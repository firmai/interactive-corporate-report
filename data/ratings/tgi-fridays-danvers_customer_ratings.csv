68,Gregory P.,"Danvers, MA",70,325,55.0,2.0,2012-04-22,"I used to love Fridays. My entire group of friends did too. But this chain has been pretty awful the last three times I've been there, so I can't even tell you the next time we'll go back.  The prices of the appetizers are absurd (the prices of the buffalo fingers seem to increase by 10-15% every single year). The last two times I've gotten the Jack Daniel's chicken, it was been rubbery. Gross.  The burgers used to be great here, but the quality changed about 3-4 years ago in my opinion. It seems to me like they started buying cheaper meat.  Service is on-off, depending on the day (just like every other chain). Do yourself a favor and stop eating at these awful chain restaurants and start eating more locally.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

But, with a great friend of mine, the dining experience wasn't all too bad... not wonderful. But, just tolerable. As soon as I got to my seat, I pushed myself in and only felt this unknown substance on my chair. I have no idea what it was, nor did I really care. But, I rushed to the cleanish bathroom to wash off my hands.  The waiter was nice enough to give us a dance and a shake with his maracas for Cinco de Mayo.  I had the turkey club, and I wasn't at all impressed by the thick sliced Sara Lee turkey on my sandwich. But, it went well with the weak Long Island Iced tea.  Still, I don't have any idea why this whole chain hasn't gone down, and why the parking lot was full by the time I left. There's nothing spectacular, or any true value in what you pay for. But, with an awkward smile, anything is tolerable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=40,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184
67,Derek D.,"Stamford, CT",50,168,120.0,3.0,2012-11-18,"Visited this location with a friend of mine who lives in the area. I don't mind chain restaurants because I usually don't expect too much from the beginning. I usually come to these type of places with friends and the atmosphere becomes a bit more important than the actual food. We both did the 2/$10 deal...I got mozz sticks and the Angus Burger, while my friend got the BBQ Chicken flat-bread and the Angus Burger. The mozz sticks were average, while his BBQ Chicken flat-bread was pretty decent. The burger was pretty good too...done to my specification and not too overly complicated. We had a couple cocktails and all was well in the world. Our server Haley was hilarious too...a big ball of energy. You don't find them like her too often. All in all, I'd probably come back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=40,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

The hosts and wait staff are always cheerful and enthusiastic and the manager always comes out to say hello. Yes, it's obviously not five-star dining, but the food is satisfying. Their signature pitch is the ""Jack Daniels Grill"" which, in my opinion, is a fitting addition to the menu. I wish they sold the sauce by the bottle! Appetizers are always good, too. If you're with a group, try the pick three-for-all. Each appetizer you choose is well-represented on the plate so it should do the trick. As for the desserts, they're nothing to write home about but are still pretty good. My only complaints are the portions, as some of the entrees are small if your hungry. TGIF is best for lunch. So, if you're short on time but still want to grab a bite, it's a good option!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=60,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

I don't go into these chain restaurants expecting the best meal of my life, I just hope for decent food, service, and prices. Friday's got everything right this time. I've been trying to drop some weight, so I had to avoid my normal habit of picking something fried, cheesy, greasy and Yummy! I found some great options on the menu that were marked as under 750 calories.  My steak was perfectly cooked, with no need for any steak sauce as the seasoning was just right. The veggies were fine. Since I tend to drink more calories than I eat, I of course got a big mixed drink. It was delicious! Both of the people with me were very happy with their meals. Our server was attentive and seemed like a fairly happy person. There is nothing that I hate more than having a waiter/waitress who obviously hates their job and is annoyed to have to do their job.

But I'd like to take that back because I did not know who my server was. They didn't come by and ask what kind of drinks we want or you know, brought water out for us while my friend and I were still looking at the menu. Never once asked if we needed help or are we ready. I understand we are still looking at the menu, but didn't even come to our table at all. The place was not busy either and we waited over 20 mins. and no one has come to our table. I told my friend I'd give them five more minutes, NOTHING. Remember, we didn't even get a ""hi"" ""hello, how are you both?"" ""What would you like to start off with?"" NOTHING. So we decided lets just walk out because that's ridiculous. THEN one of the waitress had the nerve to tell me to have a good day, I told her ""no, thank you. Worst service ever!""

However, I must agree with the other reviews here by saying the waitstaff is terrible. They take forever to check on you and all of the waitresses that I have had, were terrible. I had pne particular experience with an awful hostess. She was seating us, a family of 4, in a very tight space. I asked her if we could move somewhere else, and she caught the biggest attitude. She then said a few choice words under her breath (an f bomb, if anyone was wondering), and when my husband called her out on it she lied rather than apologizing. I got up with the kids and we left. Havent gone back since. I tweeted a complaint to the TGI Fridays account, and they had a CSR call me about the complaint and said the manager of this location would be contacting me, but not without me calling repeatedly asking to speak with him. Two weeks later I finally got to speak with him, at which point he made an excuse, that the hostess had an ""accent"", therefore I may have ""misheard"" what she said. I was shocked that he would try to justify her unprofessionalism, and told him I myself am bilingual, and familiar with quite a few accents, and I would not have made this such a huge deal if I wasnt sure of what she said. He said he would send us some gift certificates, and he did, but we went to a different location, which was 10x better than this one. My advice?

We arrived at 7pm and were seated fairly quickly, it was all downhill after that. We ordered the pretzels w/ beer cheese sauce for an app. When the pretzels came out we noticed that the container of cheese sauce looked like it was spilled or from a previous order because there was nothing but residue inside the cup. We told the girl who brought out the food & she said she would get us a new one. 10 minutes go by, & my boyfriend & I are staring at our pretzel appetizer waiting for this cheese sauce to come out. Our waiter, Jose, finally walked by so we grabbed him & told him about the cheese sauce. He said he would take care of it right away. Another 10 minutes go by, still no cheese sauce, & now our meals have arrived. He asked if we got our cheese sauce & we told him no. He never apologized, he just said let me go get it. We decided just to eat our meals because we didn't want them to get cold like our pretzels did. Finally the girl who ran our food came by & we asked her about the cheese sauce, she said she would go and get us some. We are almost done with our meals, still no cheese sauce & Jose did not come by once to ask us how our food was or if we needed refills on our drinks, which we did. Now our meals are done but our pretzel app is still sitting there uneaten without cheese sauce & we were just sitting there waiting for Jose to finally come back so we can get our check and leave. He finally comes back and asks us if we are all set & I told him that we never received our cheese sauce. He didn't apologize or offer to take the uneaten app off of our bill. I was going to ask for a manager but My boyfriend was so frustrated he just wanted to pay the bill and leave.

If this is how you treat your customers then you should feel ashamed because as a manager if I ever kept someone on hold for that long my district manager would write me up and I would deserve it.

My waiter told me, ""sorry we can do that no more, it's not allowed, I'll get in big trouble, blah  blah."" She made it seem like she would love to do it if she could, so we were very understanding and thought it was a bummer.  A week later, me and my fiance went to eat there and they were singing a woman and her family happy bday !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.348,2.32

39,Andy R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,35,9.0,1.0,2015-12-05,"Alright so i'm a huge fan of Friday's and hadn't been there for years, However after Yelp'ing this location i read the feedback from customers and figured instead of dining-in i'd place an order for pick-up thinking that i would somehow bypass the poor customer service etc. So i place my order at 1:15pm and pick it up at around 2pm. First things first, when i visit a restaurant i expect some level of acknowledgement or courtesy, it seems that in this particular Friday's location that is non-existent; I walked in and stood there right-next to the podium for a FULL 15-minutes meanwhile waiters/waitresses passed by me and none even approached me to ask if id been assisted. After getting fed-up i walk over to the bar and explain to the bartender that i'm coming to pickup an order and she happily assists me. After such unpleasant experience i had lost my appetite, When i get home i look at my order and see that i paid $15 for such an unusually small portion, the plate was literally twice the size and the cooks must've literally taken one scoop of pasta and placed it in the center of the  foam plate without any garnish or bread-stick, extras or etc. the chicken was overcooked and tasted charred and there were only 3 pieces of shrimp in the pasta (i counted).  Overall this place needs some serious management/staff changes or re-training, This entire experience has been upsetting to say the least - I gave it one star because the lady at the bar was very helpful and courteous other than that if i had the ability to do NO STARS i would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.212,2.32
8,David P.,"Beverly, MA",11,50,15.0,2.0,2015-12-08,"Service is not attentive.    My friend & I wanted to watch the Pats, somewhere, with a couple of beers & food. He suggested this place. I'm not huge on chains, but didn't want to be one of those people, so we went.  I'd been to this location many times, but not for years. I had told my friend that it may be mobbed, so we'd better have a backup plan. I was surprised to find that, despite a Pats game being on, the place was not at all busy.   I guess now I know why, based on  my experience, plus prior reviews.  My experience was not that the service was rude (it wasn't): it just wasn't there! Slow, or non-existent from start to finish.  No menus were offered; my friend finally grabbed them from the table behind us. No drink refills offered: we had to track down a staff member. Ketchup, for fries, & requested water not provided.  I was having a Jack Daniels burger, & thought that a JD, straight up, would go nicely with it. There was just no one around to take my order. Sale lost! The food was just average, making that the BEST part of the experience.

When e finally came over to take our drink and appetizer order, he ignored half the table and brought our drinks out one at a time. We had to flag down another waitress to put in the rest of our appetizer order. Another 35 min went by in an empty restaurant and no sign of our Timmy. A young woman brought out on plate of apps and nothing else, we watched as Timmy wandered around and ignored us when we clearly had food burning under the heat lamps. We flagged him down again and requested the rest of our apps and some refills. At this point another 10 min went by and Timmy came out with half our lunch, no apps and no refills. 2 of us had no apps and no lunch plates while we all sat around with empty glasses. There were only 4 of us in a restaurant with only 5 other tables and 2 other servers. I'm not one for no tipping but he didn't deserve one, and yet my many years as a server still made me tip the little jerk 12 % when what he deserved was to be fired. He wasn't friendly or helpful.

The service is just OK and the EDM music seemed out of place but my food was actually really good. I got the spicy chicken sliders on the lunch menu for 8.99 with a salad. The salad was a tad over dressed and the caesar dressing tasted a little different than what I was used to, but the sandwiches were the saving grace. Picture chicken and waffles on a sandwich. It sounds strange, but they were small sliders with chicken fingers, chipotle creme, and ghost pepper honey. I will say, it is a tad too spicy for me but the honey made it sweet just like syrup.
