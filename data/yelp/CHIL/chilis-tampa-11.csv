Justin T.,"Clearwater, FL",22,48,,4.0,10/16/2017,"Trust me. This is a very well run franchise with management that cares and knows what they are doing. It is always welcoming, busy, friendly, with top notch food and servers that aim to please. I will continue to happily give this location my business, as it is the very best Chili's in the entire Tampa Bay Region. Kudos to everyone who makes it the enjoyable place it is to spend time at. Finally, the clientele is nicely mixed, young and old, white, black, Hispanic, regulars and newcomers. I am not a pushover as a customer, and you can check and see that I have no problem giving one star reviews. Four stars is as high as I will go for a franchise, so this is my highest rating. People in this area that post on Yelp should be as demanding as I am, because I do believe this would up the quality of the overall restaurant experience in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11
Lora M.,"Tampa, FL",122,168,254,5.0,9/15/2017,Looking for places that where open after hurricane Irma hit and chilis looked promising. We came in around 11:30am and we where seated right away. They did inform us before we sat that they had a limited menu due to the hurricane. I was still very pleased with what they had to offer and started off with some chips and salsas. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We ordered our food and it was out within 20 minutes or so. Bravo to chilis for still providing their customers with great service and convenient food during this time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11
Kathy D.,"Tampa, FL",267,1210,2185,1.0,2/16/2017,"I have eaten at this Chili's since it opened about 20 years ago. A fave was the Oliver burger & Chili's really has some great fries. Of course I have eaten at other locations, but returned today to take a friend out for post Valentines late lunch. My friend ordered her fave: the old timer burger & fries....what a disaster. We got there a bit before 4PM, so late lunch, early dinner. The burger was a literal nightmare & an embarrassment for any establishment to serve. The bun had obviously been over flat topped too many times & was cared on the top & bottom inside bun. Even the top, of the top bum had grill marks on it. The preformed burger was dry & dead, we'll overcooked & inedible. There was 1 thin slice of romaine folded over for the lettuce. The pickles were fine. The ""fresh tomato"", was 2 slivers, that did not even equal a whole slice of tomato. The fries I had raved about, were limp, soggy, warm & inedible. I was so embarassed! I asked for the manager. Let me point out the restaurant was extremely slow at that time. When we arrived, there was no one to seat us, so we stood, twiddling our thumbs...starving. Waitress was very nice, but with only 2-3, tables did not get order right. The manager made good on the burger & fries & also removed them from my check. My personal problem, is he would not own that someone had a bad day & this must have slipped through. He made good on the meal, but would not admit the initial meal, NEVER, should have left the kitchen. This is where you usually have to applaud independents. They can only blame bad sales & food on themselves & not pass it off to the corporation! There are far too many superior burger restaurants in the Bay area, to put up with inferior food, unfit, in my opinion for human consumption. Yes the manager did right by redoing the dish ( not enthusiastically ) & comping the price. We were prepared for dessert  & then a nice long Happy Hour to chat & catch up. After this & a manager not willing to admit a mistake.....I have better places to spend my money. What's a girl to do ? With high expectations & options in Tampa, never settle for less than at least good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11
Al E.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1,93,8,4.0,7/18/2017,"What can I say? It's a Chilis.  It's not gourmet but the food is good.  Service, even when they are packed, is good.  Always one of my go to places for reliable food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11

Robin K.,"Tampa, FL",228,162,1148,2.0,2/11/2016,"Yeap 2 stars! Located on Dale Mabry, just few blocks away from the stadium. We sat at the bar tonite, few booths were available. The menus were sticky which is such a weird feeling. You always wonder why it's so sticky lol. Few drops of hand sanitizer and I was ready to eat.  We opted for the 2 for $20. Panko onion rings for app and Cajun pasta and fajita for entrees. I really wished they offered a heathy non-fried option for apps. Side salad or hummus and veggies would've been perfect. Onion rings were good, didn't taste any spice. The entrees were ok. Chicken fajita was just thrown in with onions and peppers in their steaming skillet (wished onions had more charred flavor). Not much flavor even with all the fixings.  Pasta was horrible, the cheese sauce tasted like it came from a can. I was so surprised that's what they served here. I had a bite and I was done.  This place used to be my goto place for burgers and fajitas but seems like the quality isn't quite there anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11

Virginia G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",286,788,879,2.0,7/5/2016,This was the worse chili's I've ever been to. At 3 in the afternoon on a Friday this place was loud as a stadium! Kids screaming in the bar...tons of dirty plates. ..drunk patrons. I except that at 1am not 3 pm.

Tiffany N.,"Tampa, FL",351,215,915,5.0,5/9/2016,"This review is long overdue. I don't typically rate chain restaurants, however, this restaurant deserves a rating.  We decided to have my son's 4th birthday dinner at Chili's. I was expecting to have at least 15-20 people to join us. Well I called another location and they couldn't make a reservation. I called this location and the manager was very helpful!! I even received a text message an hour prior telling me the table would be ready. When were arrived everything was set up and ready to go. The ONLY concern was the tables were not together so we had three separate tables. Anyhow, I understood how this happened because of the area we were in.  This was my third visit to this location and my second time having the same server. Her name is Erica. I distinctly remember her because we initially joked as I have a sister name Erika (spelled differently). Well, Erica, our server was ON POINT the entire time!! She did her thing. She got the orders right, she was professional, she was fast and friendly. What more can you ask for? She handled 16 people by herself and didn't miss a beat!! I thanked her again for her wonderful service. It was much appreciated! I love great service and because of Erica, I will go out my way to patronize this location!! Thanks again, Erica for making my son's birthday dinner seamless!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11

Amy K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",311,451,1710,4.0,8/31/2015,"I have been to this location several times and have not yet been disappointed. The staff is friendly and I've never had an incorrect order. It is located by the recently close Kmart on Dale Mabry, across from Ray Jay Stadium. I have never been here at an uncomfortably busy time and there is usually room at the bar. I enjoy sitting in the bar area and have never had bad service. If you sit at the tables, you can basically serve and pay solo with the tablet style table top kiosks. Plenty of TVs if you want to watch sports. The food has always been consistent here. I recently ordered the nachos (with beef) as my meal on a Sunday night. These nachos are individually topped and are soooo filling! The ribs, burgers and salads have never done me wrong. The servers are friendly and attentive. If you're looking for a late night nosh spot, I would recommend this Chili's location.  Parking isn't difficult and the location is convenient. Overall restaurant and bathrooms are clean and up to date. I will definitely be back here. Even better, 2-4-1 beers, wines, wells, Long Island Iced Teas and Margaritas all day every day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11
John D.,"Tampa, FL",1,28,,3.0,2/12/2017,The food & service are good. More often than not the wrong Ziosk is at my table delaying my exit. Why is it that ever time I go to Chili's the music is so loud I can't hear myself think.  I always have to ask them to turn it down and can see that others around me are glad I asked too. The Fowler ave Chili's is also guilty of obnoxious loud music during lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11
Katie D.,"Fountain, CO",42,9,8,1.0,7/13/2017,"I ordered lunch for pick-up. Service was fast but the food was garbage. I'm sitting here in my office staring at a wilted salad. Literally, the lettuce is mostly brown. There seems to be zero quality control when it comes to their produce. I also had the California flatbread. That was also disgusting. They poured a ridiculous amount of ""garlic aioli"" on my flatbread. Mostly mayo, no flavor. Who puts mayo on a flatbread?  They also neglected to put avocado on my flatbread as well. Just poor food quality in general. Will not order again. I miss the Chili's that had a quality menu...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11
Brandon B.,"Riverview, FL",17,190,480,5.0,3/8/2016,"Our server ""team"" was great and super friendly and attentive to our needs (even being a group of 10+ today). We got meal very quick even for being a Saturday evening in a busy area with a large group.  Can never go wrong with 2 for 1s all day everyday!! Bonus points for sure! I felt like all members of the party were satisfied and happy with service, food, and drinks. Which is an accomplishment with 10+ people including 2 younger kids. I must say the 3 things I tasted was exceptional. The special side order of Guac was on point. I had some of the wife's quesadilla explosion salad the next day and it was excellent (and that's next day leftovers I imagine the fresh meal was even better). The newly offered prime rib was extremely delicious, many options with it too on the menu. I tried the smothered prime rib burrito. I must say every bite was delicious and it was quickly devoured. Interesting they had 2 sides of taste based on the sauce smothering the huge burrito. Ancho chili sauce on one side and green chili sauce on other side. Both sides were great but I was a bigger fan of the green chili sauce side.  Great addition to story. Me and another member of party both ordered the burrito (menu in picture is quite enticing and lured us both) and server came out and asked us both what sauce we liked. I liked green chili and my friend liked ancho chili. So she bought an extra side of each out for both of us to smother the rest of the burrito! I enjoyed both sauces, so I decided to take mine to go and enjoy it topping something I cook at home.  Chilis is always a consistent meal and good price and this recent experience solidified that consistency. Especially impressed with the service we received as a large group on a busy day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11

Danielle is the bomb! The only reason I am leaving a five star review is because of her. Every other time we have had another server, the service has been anywhere from okay... to terrible.

Laurie V.,"Riverview, FL",18,1,,5.0,6/9/2017,"This Chili's was exactly what I needed it to be!  I went on Tuesday with my 3 kids, and was a little apprehensive about what to expect from the service since we only had about an hour to dine (judging by some of the other reviews).  As luck would have it, we had Danielle as our server!  She was friendly and totally on top of things for us.  My kids loved their meals (have to admit, they looked delicious for kids' meals), and the fruit options for their sides were great.  Another Chili's in the area had previously served a kid's meal pizza to my son with a stone-cold center; this location served it piping hot with perfect ooey-gooey cheesiness.  I ordered a salmon meal that was flavorful and cooked perfectly (the OTHER location, previously noted, had way overcooked it when I ordered it there).  We were in and out, and had a nice experience at this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11

She assured me it wasnt. When I got home 3 minutes later, not only was all my food very cold, I realized they had also gotten our order wrong. When I called the manager, he apologized and to me and saud he was going to send me some free entrees to make up for being late and the cold, messed up order.  I never received the promised entrees.

Brian M.,"Tampa, FL",1610,508,7701,4.0,5/4/2016,"Many years before the blue agave tequila revolution, I had my first margarita at Chili's Bar and Grill. Chili's still offers one of the best selection of margarita options of any restaurant. Chili's offers 2 for 1 house margaritas all day Mon-Fri in traditional, mango, strawberry, and blackberry flavors which you can get frozen or on the rocks. Chili's also offers a large variety of premium tequila margaritas for those that desire with Patron, Sauza, Hornitos, Herradura, and Millagro. Chili's 10 premium margaritas include the Patron Margarita, Blackberry Patron Margarita, Skinny Patron Margarita, El Nino Margarita, Tropical Sunrise Margarita, Blueberry & Pineapple Margarita, Platinum Presidente Margarita, Presidente Margarita, Coronarita Margarita, and Sparkling Pomegranate Margarita. In addition to Margaritas, Chilis offers 2-4-1 beers, wines, wells, and Long Island Iced Teas all day Mon-Fri! If you sit at the bar area, first come first served, you can watch the game and get free bottomless chips and salsa. Chili's fajitas are the most famous in the industry with that unmistakable head turning sizzle that causes a wave of fajita orders following anyone ordering one, according to a planet money podcast I listened to. The pepper Jack mushroom chicken fajitas are no longer on the menu but are still available and quite delicious. I either get the fajitas or the baby back ribs every time I come here. The fajitas and chips and salsa have kept me coming back for years. The fajitas offer so much food, they are enough to split between 2 people easily. If you are a member of the rewards club, you can get a coupon for weekly freebies including dessert, appetizer, or a kids meal. This Chili's on North Dale Mabry is a great stop after a Bucs game, Yankees game, or special event at the Raymond James Stadium due to its close proximity. There is a private parking lot with plenty of parking available. Chili's now has touch-screen pda's at every table that help you see what every entree looks like vefore you order, order, call the server for another drink, calculate tip, and best of all close out your tip with a credit card. More restaurants should do this as sometimes cashing out can be the longest wait of the meal. Our service has always been good and it's even better with these touchscreen PDA assistants! Don't get me wrong, most of the options at Chili's tend to be on the comfort side, but they do also have quite a number of healthy, grilled, low carb options too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11
Em S.,"Tampa, FL",185,158,1281,5.0,6/15/2015,Their fish tacos were amazing! My coworkers and I decided to mix things up and order off of Chilis lunch menu. I chose the 3 fish tacos and 2 sides of steamed broccoli. This was about $10 after tax or straight up enjoyment. The guy working the curbside (to-go) orders was really friendly and on top of things. There was no problem finding a parking spot despite how busy they were. I was in and out in under 10 minutes. The amount of food served versus pricing was unbeatable.

It is still recognizable as Chili's but it has a new sleekness to it. There is a cool faux see through wood panel dividing the dining room on the Kmart Side.

You get a salad so you feel like youre kind of eating something healthy but it has so many tasty ingredients! i was there on a saturday afternoon and the beer was 2 for 1 so i had two blue moons for $4 .. cant beat that!

Some big chains, some with limited locations and some with just one location in the entire world. That being said, I still love the CRAP out of Chili's.  For a while there, my family only went to Chili's to celebrate anything. ""Just turned 21? Lets go to Chili's. They have a great happy hour."" ""Got a new job? How about Chili's?"" ""Yay! You just graduated! I heard Chili's is good for celebrations."" First of all, they have HH all day everyday, so that is always a good deal. I usually just get beer or wine, but if I'm feeling crazy I'll get a Marg (they have several flavors) and those are simply delicious. They have several different type of smoothie type drinks on the menu as well and those are really good. My favorite app to order is the bottomless chips and salsa. Something about those chips with some salt on them make me say mmmmmm. They have a variety of stuff on the menu from steak to fish. Personally, I enjoy the fact that they have a healthy menu and everything is really flavorful. Definitely try the Southwest Egg rolls. They have a dipping sauce that will really make your taste buds sing.  I may be a bit over the top about this, but it's honestly one of my favorite restaurants in the entire world.

It is one of my co-workers birthday and another co-worker is leaving to join the police force. Well lets just say this was the worst experiance ever. It took 35-40 mins for our food to come out. Our drinks continued to become empty. Then once the waitress relized we were getting irratated she began to have an attitude with us. We actually had to grab a different girl to find out what was going on with our food. She came back and said the manager would be right out with our food and there was still another 10 mins before the food came out and the manager was not the one to bring out the food. Also once there became an issue the waitress never came back to appoligize for whatever the issue was. Her atleast aknowledging there was an issue would have made a big difference.

Table across from us came in after us, received food before us, complained that it took too long, and got it discounted. We waited for our food patiently. The manager never checked on us. They kissed ass to the people complaining. We were a little more decent than them, and received no kind of attention from the managers. We did witness our server, however, getting a ""talking to"" by a manager while at a computer. How unprofessional!  Overall, the food was okay and the place was packed, so the amount of time we waited for our meals was understandable.

We in town to surprise my girlfriends father on his birthday and big daddy wanted to have a quick happy hour stop so why not here and damn what a good decision!! We sat at the bar because of course we here for drinks. We sit and we notice this little card that says the drinks that are included in happy hour and the bartender's name which was Mike. This dude was the shit I mean this dude was the truth!! He seemed like I knew him for years, when I ordered my drink he didn't flinch I usually have hard times with my favorite drink (long beach ice tea) nine outta ten bartenders dont know what the drink is but mike did. So after our first drink he brang us some nachos that was free then he gave us two shots of some new presedente tequila it was good and FREE!!

The beer & apps are the best thing about chili's. I frequently go for lunch but the lunch combos leave me greasy & unsatisfied. Do love the balsamic dressing that comes with a house salad. Also love the fajitas-- but how can you get fajitas wrong? :) Otherwise, most items are greasy & just ""eh."" Fits my frosty beer craving though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11?start=60

Penelopy T.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",511,25,1,1.0,1/17/2010,"I'm a huge fan of Chili restaurants and this one was a real disappointment.  I was having a casual business meeting.  We waited a short time for a table which wasn't bad,  but I didn't like the hostess wordlessly pointing for us to follow her.  Our server was nice (will not mention who) very perky not well trained or focused.   Two bar drinks were suppose to be put on a separate check, went ahead and paid them without a fuss.  The food was tasteless and my partners soup was served cold.  It didn't seem like the server was trained in anything other than dishing it out.  She got down to a child's (Gosh I hate that) level to take our order - I'm not a three year old so I couldn't make out if she had to go to the bathroom.  I'm very careful about my reviews and this is my first negative.  My work requires me to always give the benefit of the doubt.  Pity this was not a good dining experience.   PT",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11?start=60

It can get pretty crowded, no matter what night you visit, but it's still good food. We haven't ever really had an issue with service here. We typically sit in the bar area for the free chips and salsa :-) It's a good go-to sort of restaurant when you aren't sure what you want to have for dinner. Obviously the ribs are fabulous, but many of their other entrees are well done, also. If you don't like chain restaurants, then just don't go!

Angel V.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,2.0,10/1/2012,"The food is alright, overall. But the service ruined the entire experience.  Our waiter had an opportunity to turn the experience around when my stomach didn't react well to a burger that I had ordered.  Instead he used the opportunity to essentially display misplaced humor at my expense.  Normally I would shrug this sort of humor off.  But the sheer fact that he showed little to no empathy at all or even offered to help make alternative suggestions when ordering left me feeling like I had wasted my time and money upon leaving.  Will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11?start=60

Great service and the most important thing to me. The lava cake was very well made. I know deserts are made by your server. But the last three did a very good job.

Tiana J.,"Riverview, FL",0,4,,1.0,3/11/2017,"To start off with, I downloaded this app just to ensure this review was written! I ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer for our table of 8-I ask for pico (keep in mind I frequently go to Chilis, including this one at least 1-2x a month) the waitress rolls her eyes (one of many times I might add) and tells me that her manager is making her charge me for the salsa, that is for the order of chips and salsa... I truly do not understand that (however it's not the charge that is frustrating it's the problem with inconsistent service-I have never been charged for the pico).  Next, one of our friends ordered a drink that she didn't like at all and didn't want it due to being way too strong for her-the waitress once again does a deep sigh and rolls her eyes, AGAIN... HOW DOES THIS WOMAN MAKE A LIVING IN CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH HER ATTITUDE?!  Third, I asked for extra napkins (she brought 5 total in beg for a table of 8) and she decided to bring an entire unopened pack of napkins to our table and basically grabs out half the bag and put on our table and rolled her eyes AGAIN and walked away with an attitude as if we were bothering her...  In essence, she was very RUDE, not friendly, horrible attitude and incredibly unprofessional and I will never spend another dollar at this location EVER AGAIN!!!!

Ciara W.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,1,1.0,1/30/2017,"I will never come to this location ever again. I was here with my husband and a friend. For one there was a wait and we decided to take a seat at the bar and looked around to see a ton of empty tables, we were able to point out about 6 or 7 empty tables all able to hold up to 4 people. This is not adding in the dirty tables which there were about 4 or so and they were not cleaned for a long while. We finally get seated at the predetermined time (still don't know why we waited so long) then we wait for our waitress about a good 5 minutes. She finally comes out, we had enough time to know what we wanted already. We order and the food came soon enough, though we have no silverware. We alert our waitress and she says ok, but doesn't bring the silverware. To make it worse she still serves another table without getting us silverware. We alert another waitress we get silverware in moments. Our server, I won't say her name, was absolutely horrid. The manager, won't say his name, was even worse. The restaurant was dirty, garbage on the floor and the bathrooms need better upkeep. Why would a company that makes so much have such a disgusting dining room and bad service. I won't even get started on the person in the kitchen without a uniform on! Or the fact my chicken was inedible.  Worst experience I've ever had!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11?start=20
Mallory W.,"Tampa, FL",54,60,47,4.0,7/31/2015,"Shocked that Chili's doesn't have a higher overall rating. This restaurant is spectacular, and a welcomed surprise to my palate. Phenomenal food with exceptional service. You really can't go wrong here.  The setting is quite charming - they really hit the nail on the head with the whole southwest-mexican feel.  The menu is dynamic and diverse - we had a hard time narrowing down our favorites (spoiler alert: we couldn't narrow down dessert and ordered two! ha! ), but ultimately, we enjoyed the following: Appetizers:  We got the skillet queso. The beef in the queso was cooked to perfection and the tostada chips reminded me of summers in Mexico in my Abuela's kitchen. You can order a bottomless portion of the chips for $3.  Entree: I ordered the chicken fajitas and was thrilled when our server brought out a sizzling skillet with freshly sliced peppers, carmelized onions, warm tortillas and typical fajita topping fare ( sour cream, cheese, salsa etc). The fajitas are of the ""make-your-own"" craze that has taken the world by storm. I felt quite trendy as I constructed the perfect meat and veggie filled fajita.  It paired well with the Arnold Palmer, and I definitely recommend this beverage.  My dining partner ordered the Old Timer burger - pretty standard, but grilled to perfection.  For dessert we ordered the Molten Chocolate cake ( I swear it's the best lava cake on earth), and the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie - can you tell I'm a chocoholic?!?!? They both were wonderful but the molten cake was so moist and indulgent, and the whole dish is the perfect ratio of cake to ice cream to melted chocolate.  I can't wait to go back again - looking forward to celebrating my next birthday here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11?start=20

R L.,"Tampa, FL",82,103,145,4.0,1/25/2015,"The food here is delicious of course, however most of it doesn't look anywhere close to the menu or like in the tv commercials.  Especially with steak. Of course this type of false advertising seems to be expected everywhere these days. Their avocado sirloin steak looks 1 inch thick in the pictures and rectangular shaped.  But what you really get is about 50% smaller and the sides are scarce too.  You also barely get 3 tiny slices of avocado. In Contrast, some items are hard to fake, if your order corn on the cob, it meets all expectations, same size as pictures etc.  Same for ribs, a half rack is actually good sized. Great margaritas here, definitely try the presidente margarita.  Salt rimmed glass and you get about 2-3 glasses from 1 shaker. Service is excellent here, a great atmosphere and you can tell that they do try hard to do good work. Parking can be tough here especially on a saturday afternoon.
