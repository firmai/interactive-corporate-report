Sue S.,"Newark, NJ",777,136,137,4.0,10/13/2017,"i loveeee cpk! i use to go all the time back in high school at short hills mall but havent been since now! i LOVE the chipotle pizza and their spinach artichoke dip with chips; however i spiced things up and got the chicken tequila fettuccine pasta!!! it was definitely a little but pricer than i wished it to be but it was soooo good and abundant so i was able to eat it for lunch the next day as well.  the customer service was good as well so no complaints there, and there was a lot of seating so all of the church members and i were able to seat with no problem!  highly recommend people to go and check it out! they're especially good with fundraisers so if you have a cause you want to raise awareness for, go here!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Ashleigh C.,"Honolulu, HI",50,16,7,1.0,12/12/2017,"This was the worst CPK I've ever been to. Let's start off with the fact that after I finished eating, there was a roach I had to kill; it was crawling on my bag sitting on top of the bar counter.  Note* This incident took place on a Monday afternoon.  Before that disastrous ordeal, I started off with a lunch combo of a chicken meatball piadina with a mediterranean salad. This was the meal I settled for after being informed that they were out of stock of the seasonal short ribs & mac meal (which I had my heart set on). The piadina and salad were okay except for the fact that the dressing that came with my salad was weird and orange, I'm pretty sure that wasn't the dressing it was suppose to come with. I was too hungry to notice sooner. Then before I left, I ordered a bahn mi bowl to go. Now home, I've noticed that I got the same weird orange dressing for the bowl when it was supposed to come with a chilli-lime vinaigrette! What a huge, disappointing difference this dressing would make, if I decide to even eat the bowl after seeing that roach on the bar counter! What a waste of $30 dollars.  The only positive thing I have to say is that the staff seemed friendly and my beehive sangria was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Vince M.,"Pequannock, NJ",11,125,281,3.0,10/8/2017,"We were very favorably impressed, with CPK. So I'll break down our review, and you'll understand why only three stars. Service. The service was excellent! From the time we walked in the door, to the time we left, service was pleasant, attentive, and prompt, but never intrusive. It's the kind of service that makes you want to come back. Ambiance. CPK is a very pleasant place to dine. It's roomy, very clean, well-kept, light and airy. The food. This is where CPK fell, from five stars to three. I ordered the pizza Margherita, and I was surprised at the excessive amount of pizza cheese. Normally, excessive cheese would be a good thing for most. But on a pizza Margherita, the cheese should be sparse, and the mozzarella should be fresh, rather than sliced pizza cheese. I found the pizza Margherita to be overly oily and heavy. I also ordered the buffalo cauliflower. I have had this dish both at home and in other restaurants, but at CPK the cauliflower appears to have been batter coated and fried, and then dressed with buffalo sauce. Again, I found it to be overly oily and heavy. The one bright spot, was the ultimate Bloody Marys. It was very well-crafted, with just the right amount of spice, but not too hot. The garnishes were interesting;  however, the mozzarella in the garnish should have been fresh, not sliced pizza cheese. We do intend to return however, and next time I will probably choose a much lighter version of the fare that I enjoyed this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Juliet Z.,"Belleville, NJ",96,179,527,3.0,8/26/2017,"Ever since Blaze Pizza opened I've had no desire to EVER go back to CPK .... But it was happy hour. I wanted some food and drinks. I forgot how great CPK is , especially those avocado rolls , which I definitely had. Along with the tostada pizza w grilled chicken ... It's still as good as I remember it.  Also I got the cocktail sampler , it was a no brainer .... 3 drinks for the price of 1 ...  That's what I'm talking about.. Why 3 stars because our waitress was noticeably having a bad day - I mean I know we all have bad days we are only human ...  But her attitude was so evident that it almost rubbed off on me (I did say almost got me in a bad mood)... Thank goodness for those drinks. And my happy hour didn't turn into sour hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne

Allie C.,"Madison, NJ",37,169,214,5.0,3/6/2017,"I was honestly surprised at how delicious the food is here: had the guacamole appetizer, and it was chunky (not mushy), which I loved. The crispy mac and cheese small plate was tasty, but not my cup of tea. Moroccan spiced chicken salad was delicious (although I would have added olives, haha), and so were the two pasta dishes. Yeah, it was a lot of food... how else am I supposed to maintain my girlish figure?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Gabi R.,"Bloomfield, NJ",62,92,814,5.0,2/20/2017,"Ordered take out. Avocado egg rolls. Delicious. Nicole the manager placed my order.  I was told my food would be ready in 10 minutes. Took a while longer. Nicole offered me a complimentary beverage and apologized for the wait. I appreciated that. CPK is known for there original hand tossed crust, Nicole says and I quote the best , so you have to try the ""original BBQ chicken pizza"". They also have crispy thin crust pizza for anyone who enjoys thin. The menu stats the Sicilian pizza. Going to try that next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Sam T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",687,138,1823,2.0,5/10/2016,"I rarely give two stars to any place that I dine in. I rather not even leave a review but I must say this night my family and I experienced the worst service. Fast forward, our food comes and before I realized we had no utensils our waitress disappears into the abyss.  After staring at my food for a minute or two and feeling Hangry my little one quickly walked over to the other table and got us 2 of 4 utensils sets. OK deeeep breeeath, WoooooSaaaaaa..... I looked over to my wife and daughters dish and realize there was no fettuccine Alfredo sauce in the dish. Ummm is this CPKs version of fettuccine Alfredo??  Anyway, moving on to what was just the beginning. Our waitress comes back and I tell her we had to take utensils from the other table but needed more. In the same breath I asked for more fettuccine sauce for two of the 4 dishes and more butter for another. Yeap, that requires her to make multiple trips back to the kitchen. Although she was polite and complied I could sense she would rather disappear back into the abyss.  Ok..ok...Let me concentrate and talk about the only good part of my night. It was my dish, Chicken Piccata, pasta with capers was actually delish!!! It allowed me to gather my thoughts enough to relax long enough to enjoy a few bites.  Now back to the madness, I got no refills of my glass of water nor was I asked. Never received the additional silverware we needed, classic waitressing 101.. What some details can change your entire dining experiencing. Not to mention we went here because my daughter chose it for her birthday dinner. So my wife towards the end asks me if were gonna get a dessert for my daughter and mention its her birthday in hopes they would come out with a candle and a quick Happy Birthday song BUT I quickly looked at my wife and said that I refused to ask because I was just so disturbed by the waitress and lack of service and good food. Did I mention we also ordered a $5 personal pizza from the kids menu and it came out with pale doughy dough. ( Big Sigh ) It simply wasn't our night so thanks CPK for hell of a night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Lovereen K.,"New York, NY",127,155,126,3.0,1/8/2017,"I went here for late lunch. The food was okayish and service was very poor. We ordered the spicy buffalo cauliflower which was good, could have been better though. The cauliflower was a little tough to bite into. The tortilla spring rolls were really good, good portion size. The salad was horrible. It says roasted veggies salad - there were barely any roasted veggies on it. Hated the salad. We sat on the table we got our food and then had to request the server to get cutlery. We got napkins and cutlery after 5 mins. So we were waiting there staring at our food. Then we got our salad and the dressing with no serving spoons. So again had to wait for them to get some spoons. Horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Anagha J.,"Hoboken, NJ",5,25,18,4.0,1/29/2017,"We went here for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised by the new additions to their menu. They now have some healthy-ish and tasty vegetarian options.  We had the fried mac n cheese, wild mushroom strozzapreti and a tostada pizza. Except for the fried m&c, everything was prepared well and tasted good.  Service was prompt and pleasant.

Joe W.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",1,70,10,1.0,6/11/2017,"This review has to do solely with service. I just walked out, which is maybe the second time in my life that I felt compelled to leave a restaurant for having a staff that doesn't care. Sat there for 5-10 minutes in a half full restaurant and had no one except for the hostess acknowledge us. This used to be the best staff at any CPK. I don't know what happened. Even when we were walking out no one really said anything. I guess they are doing so well they don't need customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Adam D.,"México, D.F., Mexico",1999,1302,1770,3.0,1/1/2016,"I know. It's mind-blowing that, despite all the pizza options I have at my disposal in Jersey, I wound up here. But every now and then, I get a craving for this stuff. And whenever I'm at the Willowbrook Mall, which isn't very often, CPK comes calling my name. I'd play it safe and go with the original BBQ chicken pizza, or any of their pizzas for that matter. Very tasty, and the order came out fast. Service was friendly too. Avoid their attempts at creativity and stick to the word that's in the business name and you'll leave content.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne

Andrew M.,"Manhattan, NY",16,7,1,5.0,5/1/2017,Great service and great food. Drinks are just the right strength too. Ambiance is great and the variety of dishes offered is excellent just like other CPKs. The Fish Tacos are my #1 pick for CPK. Flavorful and fresh and paired with a nice salsa as well.

Tamika J.,"Wharton, NJ",10,181,632,3.0,2/11/2017,"My daughter and I shopped and decided to eat here. She ordered the BBQ chicken pizza which was delicious. I believe the red onions enhanced the flavor of the pizza. I ordered fish tacos. They were very tasty by the way. I could have done without the chips and salsa side. The server was nice but not very attentive. We waited for a while to receive things we asked for like napkins and the check. Otherwise, I would have given this place 4 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne
Cory T.,"Rockaway, NJ",8,96,96,3.0,11/9/2016,"I stopped by here the other day cause I was in the mood for something a little different. CPK has pretty good reviews so I figured hey, why not.          First off I'm a little bias against pizza chains, being from jersey my Italian options are endless. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed here. The lunch special was alright, the price was affordable and the service has quick & attentive. Though the pizza was average. The decor seems upscale as if this place would be great to bring a lunch date and a few cocktails.

Lizzy D.,"Hawthorne, NJ",0,4,,2.0,7/26/2017,"Very disappointed in this location. The grilled chicken on my salad was undercooked. We told the waiter. About 5 minutes later the manager came over and apologized. Waited another 20 minutes (while my dinner partner finished her meal) before it came back. Was cooked very nicely.

Stephanie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",273,404,491,4.0,6/14/2015,"This was my first time at a CPK and I was impressed by the quality of pizza. We were seated right away on a Friday night even though it was pretty crowded.  My boyfriend and I ordered pizzas and shared. We got the mushroom pepperoni sausage and the margherita. Both had nice fresh ingredients, especially compared to other chains, but being next to NYC definitely isn't going to compare to pizza there. The pizzas are too big really for one person though they call them personal, so it's a decent size if you want leftovers. Who doesn't want leftover pizza? They defintitely have some interesting favors I am intrigued to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne

Sure, if you happen to be in the mall and desperate for food Wood Fired pizza gets me in the mood Were the carnitas bland?

Friendly staff and great service! As someone who doesn't eat pizza often due to my choice of food intake, this was the first pizza I've had in YEARS and it was perfect!

Matt B.,"New York, NY",28,67,35,2.0,4/19/2015,"Was shopping and kids started dad we are hungry. What's a good option with kids. California kitchen. Oh wait!! We were greeted at the door and the lady led us to our table. The waitress came and took our order, everything was fine till we got our food.  The food was here but partially, half the order did not show up, and most importantly there were no utensils to eat the food with. Looked around to get attention of one the waitresses but I was not successful. My wife saw a table next to us and said it had utensils. Went and grabbed it. But it was only two.  We were four and were on the hunt for another table with utensils. And we found one. What they do is they stack up plates and put utensils wrapped with napkins on them. I ran and quickly got it.  We all started eating but my wife. She ordered a salad but the dressing never came, she asked the waitress but kids and I finished as my wife was still waiting.  I said I am gonna go and get it, she said no, then I decided to go and get it, walked upto the bar and asked the barmen for salad dressing as he handed to me I saw the waitress approaching with the dressing.  So why 2 stars - the food was okay, the service - yeah definitely needs some improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=20

We love the passion fruit sangria ( must try) The environment is usually crowded but still quiet to be able to have a conversation, always clean and the service is always good!

Surrounding extablishents have vastly improved on the way they treat their customers (e.g. Bahama Breeze etc). On my most recent lunch visit, which was a regular not-so-busy day: the woman who served our table was so unpleasant (as if we owe it to her that we are eating there), very rude and appears to be miserable with her work.

The host knows our family and they're very friendly. The food is as usual delicious however my last visit to CPK with my family wasn't as pleasant.  We get our table immediately (kudos) but our waitress did not come until 5-10 minutes into our sitting. When she came, she brought our drinks relatively quickly and we went right into ordering our food. The food took a bit longer than usual to come out, I'd say 15-20 minutes? [I don't want to peg an exact time, but it was in these ranges]. I ordered a Kung-Pow Chicken Spaghetti less on the spicy side. It wasn't as spicy as it usually was which is good. My father ordered a half sized roasted veggie salad however the asparagus wasn't cooked well. We told the waitress about it and she sincerely apologized about it. Here comes the good part. FLIES. Tons of them! So yes, the food smelled very appetizing but it should be the restaurant's job to do something about this! Sanitation? I don't know. But it sure bothered my family and two other tables that were around us. (They had it harder). I cannot stress this enough but please be aware of flies.

Casey R.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,9,,2.0,9/20/2015,"$15 for a pie that only feeds one. I thought ""Okay, that's fine, if it's good enough to justify, I guess they use better ingredients or something."" Nope. I ordered the Hawaiin, I had to spit twice, once from a rubbery piece of chicken, and again from some kind of grit I still haven't identified but actually hurt my tooth. And that could be explained away by bad luck, but the final nail in the coffin was that it was just an under-cooked pie. The dough was floppy and there was no crisp to the crust at all. I'm usually not picky about these things, but this is the first time I've ever really regretted something as simple as pizza.  I don't understand how this place manages to stay open with at least three other quality pizzeria's near by.

Can't go wrong with the pizzas. my friend got the lower calories option chili and said it was delicious and perfect portion size. I have tried the pesto pasta which was delish and the tequila pasta also quite tasty (reminded me of a pasta dish at cheesecake thougg which was a lot better but this one was still good on its own right). Prices are decent. Service can be hit or miss and their drink menu can use some new options I feel like it's a lot of the same ingredients.

I am interested in coming back to try out their pizzas, looks like they have a great selection of different pizzas (different from the regular pepperoni or Hawaiian types).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=40

JoAnna D.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",366,568,342,2.0,3/25/2014,"Everyone knows that CPK has great, creative pizzas at reasonable prices. But what makes any CPK stand out? Service, service, service! And here ... the service is just not that good. In fact, it was downright annoying. I met my cousin for dinner; she beat me & already got a table by the time I arrived. I walked up to the host & explained I was meeting a woman who was just seated a few mins ago. ""Oh, are you the party of two? She's over there,"" and he gestured vaguely to the right side of the dining room. You can't bring me to her table? Fine. I awkwardly scanned the dining room, staring at strangers eating, until I found her. So much for hosting, amirite? Our waiter was a combination of lazy & rude. He never asked if I wanted a drink; he just brought me water & asked what I was ordering as soon as I sat down. Each time he brought us more water, he left the empty glasses on the table. By the end of the night, we had 5 empty glasses cluttered around us. My cousin asked for cheese on her salad & he forgot it twice.  Halfway through our meal, and interrupting our conversation without an apology, he asked if we wanted dessert. When we said no (mostly because we were still eating dinner), he brought over our check!! We weren't close to finishing our meal, but we can take the hint: it's Friday night & since we're not drinking or getting dessert (yet), you want to turn our table. He looked confused when I asked for a box for the remaining half of my pizza -- did you think I was going to keep eating when you asked me to pay after eating 2 (of six) slices? We were asked to pay 35 mins in, & we stayed only an hour. My food was great -- and there's your second star -- but does that really matter? Between the hosts & the wait staff, it's really not the hassle. So the next time you're craving those delicious pizzas? Just drive the extra 15-20 mins & visit the Short Hills Mall or Garden State Plaza CPKs instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=40

Bill M.,"Glastonbury, CT",9,53,1,2.0,9/19/2014,"Meh. Well put Yelp, Meh.  Ambiance - 3 Stars: It's CPK... what do you expect.  Service - 1 Star: They're just not good. The guy who seats you is a bit scary, intense, and a bit intrusive. Some of the wait staff is okay, but generally they're rude.  The worst experience was when the chef left the kitchen after complaining about one of the dishes. One of the specials was a chicken stuffed pepper with cilantro and other fresh vegetables, sounds delicious right? Well it wasn't. When it came out we immediately noticed a strange smell. Oh well, give it a try anyway. It was gross. There was a noticeable taste of just bad. My initial reaction was that the chicken was either uncooked, or had gone sour. I singled out a piece of chicken, and it smelled awful - and tasted the same way it smelled. When we informed the waiter that we did not want to continue eating it, nor did we want a replacement - the CHEF came out. Why they didn't send the manager out is beyond me, and why the manager didn't prevent the chef from approaching us is also beyond me. He began arguing with me that I had poor taste, and that the ""bad"" taste we were experiencing was Cilantro. Cilantro does not taste like rotten meat, it tastes like soap. He continued to argue that the meat wasn't bad, which makes me assume even more that he KNEW the meat was bad, and served it anyway! After I couldn't take any more of his crap, I interrupted him - explained to him that it was extremely poor customer service to argue with a customer - and told him to leave my presence. A manager never came out to apologize for his rudeness.  Food - 3 Stars: Despite a few of the dishes we had there being on the rather - awful - side, I still had plenty of tasty pizzas. The Habanero Carnitas is one of my favorites.  Price - 3 Stars: I think the pizza is a bit expensive for what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=40

Lor A.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",308,323,724,4.0,3/18/2012,"I don't typically love chain restaurants, but my friend and I had a good experience at CPK this weekend.  The wait was about 25 minutes at 8:00 PM, which is NOTHING compared to the wait at the Cheesecake Factory (as if I even need to say that).  The host at CPK is a trip...he is silly as hell and he looks like Sammy Hagar.   Apparently their soda machines were not working, therefore we had to choose non-carbonated beverages.  No problem.  Water for me, iced tea for her. We split the sesame ginger dumplings for our appetizer.  They were a little under-seasoned, but the plum sauce that accompanied them more than made up for it.  I couldn't decided between a pizza and a salad, so being the clever broad I am, I opted for the tricolor salad pizza.  It's essentially the tricolor salad (mixed greens, tomato, and shaved Parmesan cheese) on top of a thin, Parmesan seasoned crust.  Sounds like it would be Parmesan overload, but it was excellent. My friend ordered some huge-ass salad that had everything you can imagine, right down to pears and walnuts (which she sheepishly said that there weren't enough of).  It seemed like the tables around us were waiting an awfully long time for their apps and entrees, however, all of our food came out very timely.  I kind of felt guilty biting into everything while our fellow diners looked on with envy. All apologies! Tatiana was our server and she was very sweet and attentive.  She didn't rush us and she kept telling us to please take our time upon receiving the bill.  CPK offers a full bar menu, and if I read said menu correctly, it looks like you can order a half-glass of wine (should you choose to partially imbibe).  A half-glass of wine is an appetizer for me, however, this might suit you lightweights out there quite well.   Not a bad choice if you're looking to grab a relatively inexpensive sit-down dinner at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=60

Don't get me wrong , the pizza is ok and is better than a Pizza Hut or Domino's pizza but, for this area, it is nothing that will make your mouth water when you think of it.  There are speciality pies here you will not find at your local shop,I mean how many places have a Jamaican Jerk pie or a Pear and Gorgonzola pie? But the real gems are some of the salads. I recently have had the Miso Seafood Salad which was superb. There is a light but very tasty miso dressing and a plate full of chinese & red cabbage, avocado, daikon, edamame, carrots, onions, with chinese noodles & wontons. Even the half portions are large and I needed a doggy bag to take home the leftovers. We went on s Sunday about 5pm and went right in with no line. Service was fine and there was no rush to get us out as you sometimes find in a place like this.
