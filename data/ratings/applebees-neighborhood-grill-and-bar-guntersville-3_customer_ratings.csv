6,Richard Y.,"Arab, AL",29,51,11.0,1.0,2012-06-09,"We walked in and the hostess decided that we would like to sit in the bar area with our seven year old son , I am not against drinking but why would you sit a child in a bar. Waiting for our appetizer way to long for it. Will continue with review after that arrives. Our meal came out with our appetizer. Well should of not order steak my fault.  The server was the best part of the trip to Applebees. We will never be back to this one in Guntersville",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-guntersville-3,,,,,
0,Ashley L.,"Russellville, AR",8,9,,5.0,2014-06-27,"Had Jordan A for my server. He was very attentive & provided excellent service. Made it during happy hour so beers & apps were cheap! Clean environment, good level music. Overall great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-guntersville-3,,,,,
5,Candace C.,"Birmingham, AL",6,8,12.0,1.0,2016-05-07,"Absolutely the worst service I have ever had. We came in around 3pm. It wasn't busy at all. Happy Hour had just started. Right away, we ordered drinks and an appetizer of chips and salsa. 5 minutes passed by: Nothing. 10 minutes pass by: Nothing. Then, a pair of gentleman came in and ordered drinks and an appetizer by the same waitress we had. They had their drinks and mozzarella sticks within 5 minutes. 15 minutes pass by, and we still haven't received our waters. Once our drinks were ordered, we asked about chips and salsa and she said they were working on it. I realize that 95% of food at Applebee's is pre-cooked. Chips and salsa compared to mozzarella sticks! Seriously!? If I could give them 0 stars, I would! Once we got our chips and salsa, they were flung onto the table. Perhaps the manager would do well to train his employees on good customer service... Or perhaps, there needs to be a new manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-guntersville-3,,,,,
4,Cody W.,"New Orleans, LA",24,1,,1.0,2016-08-21,"We received out appetizers, salads, and meals within 3 minutes. Soup was cold, chicken was like rubber( probably was cooked 4 hrs earlier and reheated), and forgot the fries on another meal. I'm glad I didn't order desert because I'm afraid it could have beaten the rest of the food out. Everything was on separate plates and our party of 3 couldn't fit another plate on the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-guntersville-3,,,,,
3,Chuck S.,"Albertville, AL",62,74,3.0,1.0,2016-10-30,"We ordered an appetizer, which was a mistake, it sucked.  They brought out two saucers, once I handed one to the Bride, I noticed that the other one had food on it.  I asked for another one, and was given one.  No apology, no ""sorry about that"" nothing.  We should have left right then and there.  The app was disgusting, no seasoning, the two mains were just as bad.  The highlight of the meal was a few young children seated at tables around us, we enjoyed watching them. The waitress brought me a coke while I had over 3/4 of one left, never touched it, so wasteful.  We won't be back to this hack of a restaurant, we hope y'all do well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-guntersville-3,,,,,
1,Brian G.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,80,58.0,1.0,2017-05-15,I would not recommend this location based upon the slow inattentive service.  We were seated promptly yet we waited for our server while others just stood around. We arrived at 9pm and the business is open until 12am.  We ordered out food after 15 minutes only to be told after that they had no lettuce for a salad.  We left!   My advice would be to avoid this place to save yourself the heartache.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-guntersville-3,,,,,
2,Sam D.,"Cordova, TN",143,2,1.0,1.0,2017-09-29,"As far as the service, our dude was great (Matthew I believe). However, the kitchen needs to get it together.  Ordered the 3 for 10 APP deal, 2 beer cheese Pretzles, and 1 wonton.  1 of the beer cheese dips was completely cold.  We didn't use that one, and used the other shot was room temp.  I then ordered a Chicken Finger platter, buffalo style.  The first plate they brought to me literally looked like they took the chicken finger scraps, fried them, tossed them and threw them on a plate.  I asked the waiter about it, he said he would take it back to check with the kitchen. The floor manager brought the second plate out and it didn't look much different, maybe just less small scraps.  I didn't want the server to get annoyed with me, it wasn't his fault, so I just kept it.  The picture is what the kitchen sent to me as a correction- it looked like the same chicken and fries.  Don't get the chicken tender platter- you'll be disappointed.  You're better off ordering a massive plate of fries with a side of chicken scraps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-guntersville-3,,,,,
