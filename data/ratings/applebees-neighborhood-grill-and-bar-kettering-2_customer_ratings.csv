0,Kevin L.,"Eastlake, OH",263,258,1391.0,5.0,2016-08-23,My family and I came in yesterday. We were a party of 6. I was impressed that instead of making us wait for the big table the manager put 2 smaller tables together to accommodate us more quickly. Stacy was an excellent server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kettering-2,,,,,
2,Brad S.,"Dayton, OH",0,18,,4.0,2016-09-23,Service was good. The food was good. The problem with this place is it needs an interior update bad. I can't fault the local staff for this but it needs to be addressed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-kettering-2,,,,,
1,Jeffrey S.,"Sardinia, OH",4,44,44.0,1.0,2017-11-12,"Hey Foodies, I am not a fan of most corporate owned restaurants and Applebee's did not win any further patronage for this guy. However , I must preface my review by saying that my girlfriend likes it. So be it. I ordered a half slab of baby back ribs that tasted like dry shoe leather. If it wasn't for the decent tasting bbq sauce, I don't think they were edible. Also, there was very little meat on these bones to even consume.  My girlfriend ordered the boneless wings in buffalo sauce, and a side of pretzels that looked like #2 pencils with salt. She said they both were good. Well, we can agree to disagree to maintain our great relationship. The service was good and the waitress was friendly. Upon arriving home, my stomach was very upset, making noises that were not good! Ok, so you know the rest of the story. Was it an off night for Applebee's ? Perhaps. Will I ever return? Maybe! Will I order BBQ ribs? NEVER!!!!!!
