Nathan W.,"West Chester, PA",68,5,,4.0,7/12/2017,"Friends and I always go after 9pm for their half-priced appetizers. The food is always good, and comes out in a timely fashion. Service has always been well, and never had an issue with drink refills, extras, getting the bill, etc. We go back regularly and I would recommend to others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Brian L.,"Garland, TX",65,3,2,3.0,4/28/2017,Pricing and portions don't match. I was served my salad on a full sized plate with literally 3-4 leaves. My shrimp were precooked and tasted like rubber. I ordered the specialty drink a blue Hawaiian Long Island. It was pure water and coloring as well as the persons I was with.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Brian Z.,"Reading, PA",0,92,,3.0,11/27/2015,"Same old, same old.  Not bad, not great.  It is never either of those.  Service is generally good.  Food is fine, it just doesn't knock my socks off. I wish the chain restaurants would stop the idiotic practice of sharing servers.  One takes my order then another delivers then the original comes back after a while to check on us.  Whenever this happens they get the bare minimum tip, since I feel no one excelled at anything. Also, a tip to the manager:  whoever is supposedly ""cleaning"" underneath those little digital ordering terminals on each table is NOT cleaning under them.  Maybe the table is clean but the base of the unit is NOT. Yuck!!! All in all, very standard chain restaurant experience, but always better than the Chili's in Pottstown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Peter W.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",2,58,46,1.0,1/28/2016,"Man what a shame I thought I found a restaurant that actually put out decent food. Until I went to Car side pickup the burgers first time we're not how we ordered them no pink they were rare to medium rare at best, second time they were unedible they were so raw not to mention I had to go inside and get my food. Used to be you could go to places like this and get decent food but I guess people just don't care anymore. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Skott B.,"Reading, PA",11,1,1,1.0,7/3/2016,Be sure to check your food when getting to go stopped in ordered had a cocktail took my food and left get home and realized the premium side was not missing there was plenty of room in the to go box guess they were too busy since it's a holiday weekend and the bar was empty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Trevor M.,"Wyomissing, PA",8,114,135,3.0,6/2/2016,"We came in for apps and all of it was just ok. The steak quesadillas, which were described as sirloin on the menu, tasted more like the meat was chewy hamburger. Severe skimping of sauce on the boneless buffalo wings (ongoing problem.) And the fries were hot for a few minutes. Also, never had to park so far from a restaurant at 10pm. Will return in about 6 months, after I've forgotten how mediocre Applebee's is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Thomas K.,"Reading, PA",11,190,638,3.0,10/24/2015,"A normal Applebee's. Had my mom with us and needed a quick meal after visiting Pennhurst. Everyone was satisfied with the meals, but I wish we had gone into Reading. Our waitress was very nice and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Elizabeth B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,,5.0,12/18/2014,I've been here several times and I always get good service and good food. This is a very well managed chain restaurant. My burger was cooked perfectly and very juicy. The bartender/server was very attentive. She even laughed at my husband's bad jokes!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Dan F.,"Reading, PA",23,8,4,4.0,5/26/2014,"Fast and friendly service, with the service right on with replacing drinks before they were empty. Appetizers were to the table superfast, large quantity of wings and mozzerella sticks. Only issue was slight over cooking of Steak & wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Erica U.,"Reading, PA",1,14,4,4.0,1/30/2015,"Been there several times the waitress this time wasn't the best. Food was excellent & I had a Bahama mama drink it was ok. But I don't drink often. My Husband, son & I were celebrating our 11th wedding anniversary. He was the safe driver. Steaks were excellent & the mild wings are the bomb with blue cheese",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Julian M.,"Sterling, VA",9,13,1,5.0,7/25/2014,"Really happy with this place. The appetizer boneless wings were very good with some hot buffalo sauce on the side. Friendly staff. You pick two menu is also a great addition to sample different meals. I also really loved the mini tablets they have at the table so you order, pay, view foods, and even order refills and call your server on it! Had a very good time with my girlfriend and will be definitely going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
Eric S.,"Birdsboro, PA",2,30,,4.0,12/2/2012,"Friendly service and quality food from Applebee's, The salads, soup, burgers, and sandwiches are always good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-reading-5
