8,Sara Amelia S.,"Sioux Falls, SD",8,16,,1.0,2014-06-12,"Waited 10 minutes for water then 45 minutes for 2 salads and soup, Mac and cheese, a sandwich and burger. My kids were in tears they were so hungry. Waitress was MIA for at least 30 of those minutes and my sons Mac and cheese looked like it had been under the heater for a long time, which the burning hot plate also indicated. I ended up asking the hostess if she could check on our food since our waitress was nowhere to be found and it magically appeared 30 seconds later. Mac and cheese was gross from sitting, my sandwich was slipped together, but everyone else's food seemed to be ok. If the restraint was busy I would be a lot more understanding but it was near empty. We were just passing through Wausau but we will go somewhere else if we find ourselves in town again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wausau-3,,,,,
2,Leah W.,"Minocqua, WI",7,4,,1.0,2014-11-17,"Where do I start? On Saturday we decided to go to lunch at Applebee's.  The waitress was initially very friendly and everything came out very consistently and quickly. We received our appetizer quickly. Then things went downhill.  After waiting for a while the waitress told us another server accidentally grabbed two of our entrees and set them at another table and that it would be a while for our meals. We were understanding and waited.  We waited just under an hour from the time we received our appetizers until our entrees came out. During that time another table ordered and received their meals.  When we got our bill we asked to talk to a manager who said he would check the times the order was put in. Why? We simply did not get our food.  When the manager came back he said that we asked to have our meals held. (We did not)  At that point he obviously became irate and grabbed the bill and huffed ""I will take care of the bill"" While the bill was taken care of we were so embarrassed and basically slinked out.  Not only was our food late we got blamed for it.  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wausau-3,,,,,
7,Amanda O.,"Wausau, WI",0,10,1.0,2.0,2015-02-15,"I haven't been there in two years, and don't plan on going back. They used to be my favorite restaurant, but after so many bad experiences they have lost me. The food was always terrible, my boyfriend almost chipped a tooth on their Bacon, servers are usually rude and short with us, and bringing up my concerns to a manager either results in expired coupons or an equally bad second meal. Cut back on renovation costs and focus on your food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wausau-3,,,,,

5,Daniel M.,"Wausau, WI",0,19,8.0,5.0,2015-04-11,My family and I ate here and it was great. With only one exception my wife was not feeling well and the sandwich did not agree with her but we still enjoyed the food. The stage was great. And because the sandwich was barely touched they took it off the bill. Great and friendly service.  4-11-15,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wausau-3,,,,,

Kind, friendly, right down to the manager checking on everyone's visit The food is great, menu changes a lot, which I love, and the food is always delicious!! We love stoping because we know we will always be happy with our time here I'm not one to love chain restaurants, so if one were to ask, I would chose this location as my top chain pick, above and beyond :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-wausau-3,,,,,
