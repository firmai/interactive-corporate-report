Angela H.,"Clearfield, UT",68,206,381,4.0,5/16/2014,Applebee's is trying to change a lot of things. Their menu features more choices for the budget minded person.  They also offer more lower calorie food choices. My daughters were also happy that they revised the kids menu. Both in amount of items and also that there are size options now. I'd give it five stars except it seems they are trying to deviate from a peppy restaurant chain to a want-to-be local sports bar/restaurant.  Who are we kidding here folks? Applebee's has nothing small town about it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Farah S.,"Roy, UT",45,103,101,1.0,12/29/2017,"I'm one of the few holdouts for Applebee's these days, and tonight I was craving steak for dinner (which is rare for me.) I signed up for an online account, and when I went to check out, it told me I was an ""invalid user"" and to call the store. Not the store's fault, no biggy there. But then I called the store. Phone just rang and rang. I get it's a busy Friday night, no biggy again. I proceeded to call them five more times, spaced out to give them time to catch up with whatever was causing them not to answer, and nobody ever picked up. Really disappointed. I understand busy nights, I work in retail and sometimes we don't get to answer the phone either. But to not answer for hours is pretty extreme. It's too bad, I really wanted steak tonight. Won't ever try to eat there on a weekend again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Kaylee O.,"Ogden, UT",34,26,,1.0,6/7/2017,"This food was absolutely disgusting. What happened to this place. When I was a little kid I came here all the time. Came here for mothers day and had crap service and the food was awful. The chicken was flavorless, ribs were very tough, and my broccoli was nasty. Something needs to change about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Matthew I.,"Boynton Beach, FL",10,29,35,3.0,6/13/2017,"It was good. Not great. Just an average diner. Prices have gone up, not as good of a value as it used to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Nic E.,"Ogden, UT",4,1,1,1.0,4/18/2017,"Been going there for 3 years roughly.. Generally a minimum of 1 visit per week ( usually carside ) my previous visit was an extreme disappointment (ordered to go and received unfinished meals ) then a few days later (today) I went in and was there for 53 minutes and I was only able to procure an appetizer a beer and a water .. (In the first 5 minutes) I waited plate and glasses empty.. hoping to order an entree or at least some more water .. But enough was enough and I wanted to leave .. Took 20 minutes to get some one to get the manager .. ( funny enough she was the last one who had spoken to me thirty plus minutes prior) I made her aware of the fact that I received practically no service and that now I had to return to work .. Hungry ... She rang me up handed me the bill said ""sorry bout that"" No real concern in her voice .. no offer of a discount.. no offer of a coupon ... Just a bland uncaring (sorry bout that)  Wich was as empty as my stomach ... 4 to 12 times a month I used to visit this establishment .. Not any more .. Take from this what you will ..  But I l would rather spend my money elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
MaKayla C.,"Ogden, UT",0,20,,2.0,3/15/2017,My mom ordered and did the car side to go. I walked in and there wasn't any signs or anything telling me where to go. I finally asked and they led me halfway up a ramp. Kind of an awkward set up but whatever. They said they had just barely finished everything. Well I get home; a little over 10 minute drive. I got chicken pasta and by the time I got home it was cold. On top of that there was literally no flavor. Not on the chicken or in the sauce. My stepdad's order was wrong; not really worth driving back to fix it though and my brother said the fries were also boring and had no flavor. Service was quick and friendly though. But I was reminded when we never come here; food is bland and kind of expensive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Candace L.,"Roy, UT",103,21,90,5.0,10/11/2016,"Super friendly,professional, and prompt service. Love the new menu! The waitress was super helpful and the chef was very nice to bring my food out to me. Everything is fresh and delicious! Great job Applebees, I'll definitely be coming back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Anna N.,"Ogden, UT",94,37,31,1.0,10/7/2016,"This review is for our visit a few weeks ago when that storm shut the power off. I had ordered the 2 for $deal for myself so that I can have left overs for lunch tomorrow. My husband ordered 2 apps and a burger with fries.  Our apps came out with no utensils. We waited patiently to flag someone down and got our server. Then my food came out. I started to eat it because my husband was still eating his apps.   Then the server walked by and said he wondered where my husband's burger was. It should be right out. So as I was about to finish my food. The server walked by and said he forgot to put in his burger. He can have it right out. Then why didn't he just do that and not have us get angry? Just say that it will be out in just a minute because of a kitchen mishap. That's what I would have said as a server.  My husband was quite upset because he didn't want me waiting for him to get his burger then eat it as I watched. So he decided not to put that burger order in. The manager asked if everything was ok when she walked by. Then the server walked by and said in a joking way that he forgot to put in my husband's order. Like it wasn't a big deal that my husband was still hungry. The manager apologized and asked if he still wanted the damn burger. He said no. We weren't offered any discount, just a lame apology that didn't feel sincere from both the server and manager.  That's the last time we will both be dining at any location. A place like this doesn't deserve my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Matthew M.,"Ogden, UT",47,30,2,1.0,8/12/2016,We went here after a fun time at lagoon and thought it would be good the steak and shrimp were not good the shrimp Way to to chewy.

Ashley C.,"Magna, UT",11,7,,5.0,9/23/2016,We have been going to this Applebees for months now. Always go Saturday or Sunday  around 11. Tried tonight pick up for dinner. They had everything we ordered all sauces and hot.  Was impressed considering how I have heard bad review's lately from there. No matter what we have always had great experience with Tooele location. Love the. Cheeseburger egg rolls and chicken wonton tacos. Mmm.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Helen B.,"Clearfield, UT",0,19,3,5.0,1/12/2017,"I have to say, I haven't come here for some time, but not sure why. This was just a perfect meal for me. The sirloin was prepared just as I ordered, the garlic mashed potatoes  were wonderful and the broccoli was cooked just right. I'm pleasantly surprised. I will return sooner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Tom H.,"Ogden, UT",13,25,10,1.0,8/2/2016,"Computers were down, which I can excuse, but that doesn't mean you have to keep a party of ten people waiting for an hour to get their food; then bring it out cold. And this was on a slow night, to boot, when there were more servers in the restaurant than tables of diners. I understand, crap happens, but you can't ignore you customers and hope they're okay with being kept waiting without explanation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Juliette S.,"Ogden, UT",36,1,,5.0,9/1/2016,Went there tonight for dinner. Half price apps after 9 the cheeseburger egg rolls were bomb! You've gotta check them out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Jeff G.,"Ogden, UT",16,7,,2.0,8/26/2016,Waited 7 min to have someone acknowledge that I was in the Carside ToGo area. Total of 20 min past the reported time from online ordering before the food came to my car and then they had to run a credit card while my food was sitting in my car getting cold. Luckily it was still warm when I got home. Food was good.  Unsure if I will chance Carside ToGo again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Danielle C.,"Layton, UT",33,5,,1.0,10/5/2016,"Server was great, kitchen staff not so great.  Wanted the shrimp avocado grapefruit salad with option of grilled chicken instead of shrimp, I requested to substitute and delete ingredients, the kitchen Declined my request to substitute fried chicken fingers for the optional grilled chicken offered on the salad (they serve a fried chicken salad so not an unreasonable request) delete the grapefruit and switch dressing. I had to go for the fried chicken jalapeño cornbread crouton salad which I requested no croutons and a different dressing because I can't eat spicy food, it came with no croutons but not the cilantro ranch I requested which I didn't know until after I covered my salad with it.  So I ended up eating just the chicken pieces that had no dressing leaving an entire bowl of salad behind.  Server was apologetic and said he would try to see what his mgr would say, I declined, as I've seen her response before.  Their kitchen staff needs to be a bit more flexible, the restaurant was not packed, they just choose to not be flexible as evidenced by my server requesting me to have a plan B ahead of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Matthew K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,1,1.0,5/29/2016,"Wanted late dinner, appetizers and drinks. Lights were turned off on the outside at 9:35 p.m. on a Friday. Staff was friendly, but service was slow. Manager was eating dinner at the end of the bar. At least he got good food and service. Apps came out only 2 minutes prior to entrées.  How can you screw up wings and nachos?  They did. Dinner was cold and shriveled. Salad was kind of gross. Was too tired to complain, we left and needed to order edible food elsewhere (In-N-Out). Not all Applebee's are bad, but Avoid this horrible experience if you can.  Was bumming so much I HAD to deliver my first Yelp!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
James G.,"Surprise, AZ",3,18,31,1.0,12/18/2014,Worst Applebee's I've ever been too!!!!!!! I figured their whole revamp it might be worth a shot...... Wow I was disappointed  The loaded bacon Berger had very little bacon.  I will not return ever  Chills it is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Dennis S.,"Loomis, CA",50,40,2,2.0,1/2/2016,This is by far the worst Applebees I've been to but the busiest.  Must be demand here next to the freeway.  The service was bad forgot our drink orders.  We didn't have silverware when food came.  The wings were small with little meat.   The bbq ribs a full rack had about as much meet as a half rack at a decent bbq joint.  However this was dry and tasteless.  The kids shrimp was just plain gross.  The mountain dew was the highlight of the trip.  The coleslaw tasted like cabbage in water.  The French fries were chewy not crunchy....  Very expensive for what you got.  Below par service food and atmosphere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Stephanie G.,"Ogden, UT",0,27,2,2.0,9/30/2016,"We use to have an okay experience here. Nothing to brag about, but nothing to complain about. Tonight we were in for a surprise when we had a 40 min wait for our food only for it to arrive cold. No apology from the server, who also never bothered to refill our waters, or be of good service the entire time. The food was about the quality of a TV dinner, which is basically what it ended up being because we figured it would taste better warmed up in our microwave at home! The highlight of the evening was the hostess, who was friendly (unlike our server) We won't be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3
Melanie C.,"Ogden, UT",121,6,3,1.0,1/14/2016,"Such a disappointment. Manager Jason had the servers lined up against the wall waiting to be barked at, he had a very unpleasant disposition.

Jason M.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,1,,1.0,6/23/2015,WORST DINNER EXPERIENCE IN UTAH.  Waiter had an attitude and took almost 10min to bring us water.  Waiter then questioned my wife's ID. First time we've been double ID'd in Utah. I was unhappy with the policy and then found SPIT in my salad dressing. Absolutely unacceptable.  Waiter should be fired along with the manager.

Carl B.,"Clearfield, UT",24,1,,1.0,3/7/2016,"Well let's see, cooks can't cook, rare steak came out medium well, fiesta lime chicken came out stone cold, and the manager Jason gave us lame excuses and comped our drinks.

Eric R.,"Logan, UT",0,5,1,1.0,11/23/2014,"I was there a few weeks ago, and ordered the ""Oriental Chicken Salad Wrap"" as I was eating there was a blond hair in my food. I decided to forget about it and continue eating, until I got another piece of blond hair. My friend insisted I get a new order, so I did, got some sauce with it, and another black hair right in the sauce! Blah..... I ended up being disgusted. The manager came around and gave me some fake smiles and what not he promised ""we don't have hair in our food"" I decided to keep quiet about that 3rd hair and move one with it. They didn't offer me anything by way of apology. Needless to say, I won't be back ever. If you love hair in your meal I recommend this place, if not steer clear!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3?start=20

Kelly W.,"Ogden, UT",22,33,25,5.0,8/16/2013,"I've gone to different applebee's over the country. This one is another traditional, usual Applebee's. There is nothing that makes it distinctive from the other franchises. The food choices are plentiful, with many options for those on diets. They are willing to make substitutions for food if you don't want one side or another side. They have some seasonal options as well. This one is open pretty late and is not usually busy, which is beneficial for a Deaf customer. I absolutely love their dedication to service, specifically my waitress - Cassie. The manager will stop by your table to check in, but if he doesn't you can get $10 voucher. I would eat here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3?start=20
Matt T.,"Ogden, UT",18,18,,1.0,7/31/2014,"I honestly don't understand how someone could rank Applebee's anything above 1 star. Everything they serve tastes like it was just tossed into the microwave for a few minutes. You would definitely be better off heading over to Costco, buying a few frozen entrees, and then taking them home and microwaving it yourself. It would certainly save you the time and hassle of entering quite possibly the worst restaurant ever invented.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3?start=20
Keisha T.,"Ogden, UT",0,4,,1.0,4/2/2015,"Waitress was awesome! However the food not so much. Got nachos & meatballs as an appetizer. Meatballs tasted like they were frozen & reheated, I did like the shaved cheese on top of the meatballs but that didn't make up for their frozen & reheated taste, i did like the bread that came with the meatballs- I should of asked for more of that bread. My nachos-the chips were the bottom of the bag so I got all crumbs. I brought that to their attention & instead of making a new nacho for me they just brought out some extra chips...booooo. Even my drink was not good, i got a Kiwi lemonade it was way warm, had to ask for another(ice). For my meal I ordered the Alfredo chicken pasta, the pasta was cooked alright, the alfredo sauce was totally from a can but I would have to say the diced tomatoes were a pretty good addition, I think some fresh grated Parmesan on top of it would of been nice, the breadstick that came with it was completely non-edible, hard as a rock. This experience made me not want to give this location my money again. Im giving 1 star for my waitress, I think her name was Chelsea...she had black hair, tattoos, tall and wasn't over the top fake. I'll maybe go back because I did see my friend Shania is now working there, our 2-4min great conversation kinda made me take my mind off the bad food....for a moment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ogden-3?start=20
