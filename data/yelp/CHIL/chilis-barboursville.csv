Eric W.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,3.0,8/10/2017,"Chips were stale. The crispy chicken tenders had a rubbery texture to them. Corn on the cob did not smell the best and had no flavor, along with the rice. Would only recommend if you're starved and there is absolutely no where else to dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Robert Q.,"Clinton, TN",0,3,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Should have checked Yelp reviews before going here but I didn't. Big mistake because I ordered take out and waited almost 30 minutes and then got back to hotel and realized I had 3 chicken crispers in my sampler platter and NO fries with Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Too tired and too far to go back once I noticed. Also saw an employee smoking with two ""friends"" out front along the Mall Road. Very unprofessional. Won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Nicholas M.,"Milton, WV",1,32,19,2.0,9/24/2016,Updating my review. I get take out here a lot. More than once I've ordered guacamole with my chips. It's a crap shoot. Sometimes it's fresh. Sometimes it's brown and inedible. Tonight it's inedible. Waste of $5. Really disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Dick F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,97,18,1.0,6/15/2016,Slowest place I've ate at in a long time...drank 2 beers when I should have had 6 in that amount of time...food took forever..had to ask for silverware..chilis corporate should flag this place it's terrrrrrrrible,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Sara H.,"Kenova, WV",0,20,,2.0,7/9/2017,"First of all the waiter was very rude and wouldn't say anything to us very understaffed and need to be trained on customer service, second of all the food taste like shit it went downhill since they got new managers. Would NEVER recommend anyone go their again. You're welcome",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Kayla T.,"Ashland, KY",56,34,13,3.0,8/20/2016,"Food deserves 5 stars, but the lack of service severely drug ut down.  I didnr receive any refill had to ask for check three times and ask about happy hour and was ignored",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Daylily F.,"Climax, NC",0,106,62,4.0,9/3/2015,Great service Jennifer! Excellent food and happy hour is no problem here. Way to go!! Mustang USMC,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Megan L.,"Huntington, WV",0,8,,2.0,11/18/2016,Host was weird. Food was over-cooked. Even the salad was mediocre. The waitress was the only reason they got a 2 star. Blah.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Shelby S.,"Fairview Heights, IL",18,3,4,1.0,5/9/2016,"The food was fine...as long as you didn't order a steak. They have new cooks that couldn't cook a steak to save their damn life!! I ordered a medium rare and it came out well done, the second one came out medium well. I ended up canceling the order. IM SO PISSED!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Michael P.,"Aurora, CO",104,389,21,2.0,7/3/2012,"Only a good drink menu makes this place tolerable.  I am not sure how you can burn a hamburger or under cook chicken on a salad, but this location did multiple times.  I will only come to this location for chips/salsa and a drink to watch a game, and nothing more. There are better locations in Charleston which has a decent kitchen to cook. The wait staff is average nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Brian W.,"Huntington, WV",1,10,,2.0,7/31/2015,Got the classic ribeye. I asked for medium..I got medium well to well done. This after waiting 30mins for the food. Server was great. But when asked to speak to manager bout are food being cooked wrong (Alicia's burger was overcooked and crispy) the kitchen manger's 1st response to me was oh the ribeye with pink in it? To which my reply was that's not medium I've ordered my steaks medium for 20yrs do you think idk what medium looks like? She quickly moved on to Alicia's burnt burgers and I got up and went to the bathroom..needless to say their GM will be getting phone call on her attitude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Jeremy G.,"Ashland, KY",14,20,29,4.0,11/1/2014,"A great change tex-mex restaurant. They are constantly re-doing their menu in a position wAy. Plus, their new pay at the table kiosks allow you to add drinks or desserts to your order AND pay by credit/debt anytime you want. Plus, the food is excellent",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Chaz W.,"Grayson, KY",24,145,354,4.0,10/25/2010,This has become my favorite 'spicy steak' dish since they closed down CR Thomas in the area.  I had an 8oz sirloin with fries and corn on cob. Their corn is great. The steak could have been spicier and better cooked. I ordered it medium but it was very red.  My service by Michella was very good.  I took a very unsavory post meal pic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Cody M.,"Valdese, NC",1,24,17,4.0,8/13/2014,"I went with a few colleagues from work for supper. We waited for 5 minutes for a seat, which isn't bad. We ordered queso for an appetizer. It was different from any queso I've ever eaten but in a good way, I really liked it. The service was good and prompt. The food was prepared well and everyone at my table was pleased. Really the only negative thing was that we were seated so that we could see in to the kitchen and it didn't look the most organized. I'm not going to call it dirty but cluttered and the floor was a bit messy in the kitchen. Overall good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
William S.,"Huntington, WV",90,172,606,2.0,9/19/2014,"I've never liked this place. The food quality is terrible. The biggest offense in my book? They are called Chili's, yet nothing is truly spicy. Once I went and asked for Tobasco to drown out the flavorless food and they have me the vinegar mess Frank's Red Hot. As a pepper-head, I find this offensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Ben C.,"Huntington, WV",11,78,99,3.0,5/27/2014,"This is your standard chain restaurant. Thy have recently updated their tables with the partial self-service tablet. It will take a while to see how well that works here, but I feel like the overall food/service has been dropping over the months. The Chips n Salsa are great (but price went up some and is a little high for chips n salsa). Their new menu items seem to be ok, but it depends on the day and how busy they are. Place it better suited for lunch than dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Paula P.,"Madison, WI",2,65,,1.0,11/19/2011,"Normally I try to find the good in things and at least give a positive spin on something, but I can't do that with this Chili's location. My husband and I got a giftcard to Chili's, so we went here. When we showed up, it was suppertime, so we expected things to be busy. We asked for a place for two, then sat and waited to be seated. Several other couples that showed up after us were seated before us. Still, we waited, and finally we were seated. When we were, things didn't get much better. The table was still sticky, even though it had been sitting open for about five-seven minutes. The waiter, while kind enough, didn't write down our orders and thus forgot that I requested no tomato on my burger. Not a huge issue, either, but not impressive. Someone from the kitchen actually brought our food out, and she provided the best service of any of the employees. During the course of our meal, our waiter sat with someone at another table and talked the entire time. If we had wanted anything else, it would have been impossible to request it, as all he was doing was chatting. It was pathetic. The food was okay, but nothing outstanding. We filled out a negative service survey on their website, and heard nothing back, not even an apology for our poor experience. So I plan on never returning to a Chili's. It was just that bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Bob E R.,"Doylestown, PA",1,5,,1.0,4/6/2014,"Stopped tonight while travelling.  Always do good stopping at Chilies. Well not tonight, food came right out, grillrd chixken on tacos, rice, and hot beans. It came right out of kitchen, and was all ice cold. I got a ""sorry"", but no real satisfaxtion. I paid for my beer, and went to a neighbor resturant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Adam B.,"Wayne, WV",0,23,76,4.0,3/27/2013,"Great place to eat but is always busy especially on the weekend and usually after 4pm throughout the week. Would have gave it 5 stars but you always gotta wait for something here. I like the food here, but like I said you gotta wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Amber M.,"South Point, OH",3,2,,4.0,3/21/2015,"Service was a little slow but the food was hot and delicious. I had the Monterey chicken with corn on the cob and loaded mashed potatoes. My boyfriend had jalapeño BBQ chicken enchiladas, and we shared chips and salsa. Being able to pay at the table was really convenient. Would have given 5 stars if our waitress had been a little faster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville
Adam S.,"Gallipolis, OH",0,12,,5.0,4/19/2014,Very very good I read the other reviews on here and was worried but it was great.  fajitas were great every thing was hot and fresh.  Will visit again .  Had good service from the waitress also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville?start=20
Janet F.,"Morgantown, WV",29,197,,4.0,6/7/2010,"Ate here with an old friend from college and it was delicious! The service was prompt and the food was quality. The skillet queso dip will always be a favorite of mine! Though I would strongly recommend no one even try on a Friday or Saturday night after about 4:30. When we went in at 4:00pm there were lots of empty seats, but the line was spilling out the door by 4:30. Why no 5? The food just doesn't blow me away. It's a good, measured quality but it fails to get me excited on it's own merits. But it is still a great place to catch up with friends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville?start=20
Tracee C.,"Huntington, WV",1,25,16,5.0,7/15/2012,"Waitress was very nice & kept a good watch on our drinks.  Never once had to ask for a refill.  ALSO, my boyfriend dropped a potato skin on floor & she saw it....she brought us 2 new potato skins!  Food was very good & we will definitely be returning to this establishment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville?start=20
Bill H.,"Huntington, WV",3,3,,1.0,1/19/2012,"Lately, the place seems to stay dirty.  When walking towards the restroom, one easily can view the kitchen ...very unkempt...I can only hope that's not indicative of the food I've received.  Not one of my favorite restaurants any longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville?start=20
Vicki D.,"Ashland, KY",0,2,,3.0,8/24/2014,"my food was excellent , husbands penne pasta was undercooked and not warm.... he ate it any way because he refuses to send anything back...good atmosphere and waiter was attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville?start=20
Holly C.,"Ashland, KY",4,9,19,3.0,3/2/2011,"This place would have gotten a 4 if I didn't have to sit for 20+ min while my waiter talked politics with the people next to us. We had the queso for an appetizer which wasn't very good and reminded me of refried beans but the salsa and chips were great. I ordered the half rack ribs with a dry rub, which were small but delicious. The fries were only ok. My husband got the steak, which he devoured and some mixed veggies which was just broccoli and carrot strings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville?start=20
Eric K.,"Proctorville, OH",0,1,,4.0,1/3/2011,"My wife and I love to go to Chilis.  We always start with the tostada chips and salsa, then she usually gets the Margarita Chicken, and I get the Memphis Dry Rub ribs! But everything there is good- the original burger, the country fried steak, all if is awesome.  And you just can't beat the El Presidente Margarita.  For a great evening out, go to Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barboursville?start=20
