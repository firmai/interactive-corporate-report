Karen N.,"Escondido, CA",561,252,3900,2.0,2/20/2016,"Don't come here unless you have a lot of time. It will take longer than it should, even if you call ahead to put your name on the list. Every single time, lunch or dinner, I am amazed by how much time has passed when I go to leave. We had to wait more than 30 minutes for dessert once, asking repeatedly where it was. Today luckily we had a coupon for Buy 1 entrée, get 1 free. We got 2 ribeyes, trying to get the most value out of our coupon. One of our steaks looked completely different, like a sirloin. I said something to our server Stephanie, and she went back to check with the kitchen. Their response was that the steak is weighed, and the same size. Yeah, still not convinced. Ribeyes are round, not triangular. The food is decent most of the time. The asparagus is usually tough. The steak knives tear your food, maybe bring your own. Pizza and dessert are good, and some of the small bites. We got takeout a week ago (another free offer). It was fairly fast, maybe 15 minutes or so. The BBQ chicken salad isn't as good as CPK, get it there instead. Potato skins were good, but a little light on the toppings. It is also often dark, cold, and very loud. You do a lot of ""What?, I can't hear you"". Our server Stephanie was very nice, putting up with my requests and flagging her down repeatedly. Luckily they put your server's name on your table slip, plus any discounts you are eligible for with the rewards program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Josef C.,"San Marcos, CA",0,9,,3.0,10/20/2017,"Service: FANTASTIC! server (Heather) was on time, not too pushy not too slow, not anything but nice ... 9/10 Food: I took a steak which was okay, it was prepared to my satisfaction (medium rare). My significant other ordered a soup and salat. Both not too spectacular, but okay. Not well presented. We found it was prized ok. Maybe a bit over prized. 6/10 Location: nah. It felt like the cheesecake factory just a little brighter inside. However, the issue is that BJs simply is not the cheesecake factory offering great deserts. 6/10 because it is close to the mall. Music: it is a sports bar concept with too many TVs. If you do not want to talk to somebody, but just stare on sport events, this could be a good place for you, not for me. 4/10 Comments:  overall, the only reason why we wanted to try it out is because we got tired of the horrible service of the cheese cake factory. Heather our server was great, the food not really and the ambiance loveless ... would we come back? nah ... thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Bree M.,"Poway, CA",399,244,330,2.0,8/28/2016,"This is a good example of why I gravitate toward independently owned establishments. I do believe BJ's began with the intention of being a solid pizza/brewery house. Somewhere along the way, they lost all sense of what is truly important in the service industry- SERVICE. The menu at BJ's is extensive, but not so much that they should not be able to handle it. We came in at 5:30. Party of 7- 3 younger kids, 1 teenager and 3 adults. When we arrived it was pretty mellow and none of the other tables were occupied. We had decent service in the beginning. There was no issues in bringing a bottle of good wine and waters and 3 appetizers to a table - before most of the party had not arrived. We felt like once the other tables were filled, we were forgotten. It took us 20 minutes to get a slice of cheese on a plate for a kids cheeseburger meal that they forgot the cheese on! We were never checked on, or even spoken to as fellow humans... other than taking an order and putting us through the BJ's machine. The food was palatable. I cannot say any of our meals stood out. I'm not a fan of less than 100%. BJ's in Esco is far from breaking the 80% mark. Our seared ahi salads were mediocre (I'm an asshole for ordering ahi in BJ's) Meals were served so staggered, we didn't have anyone eating at the same time.  This restaurant is thriving on people who visit the mall and have a one-time meal, happy hour or event here. You won't find a local crowd here, even if you dig deep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Sergio L.,"San Diego, CA",1,12,,2.0,7/3/2017,"Food is inconsistent. I've been to this location 4 times. Ow and every time you get a different level of service and food quality as well. However, this last time was just bad. My wife and I found ourselves constantly having to hunt down our server just to get a refill on our drinks. At one point is was comical. Our drinks were empty and had been for about 7 minutes. I had to stop eating because I didn't want to choke in my own food and the server walked by and said if I wanted a to go box, when yet my food wasn't even half way done being eaten. I respond sed with no, I've been waiting for a drink. Staff is very dismissive here, and it's like they just expect your tips versus actually working for one. **update** Less stars due to management responding to this but never followed up with me. They display a false sense of genuine care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Lim K.,"San Diego, CA",0,374,177,4.0,2/26/2017,"We went to BJ's for lunch for the first time and shared a couple of dishes: kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad and the spicy pig pizza.   The salad was very good.  The pizza was tasty; however, the ingredients on the pizza were not evenly distributed.  It looked sloppy and a couple of pieces had mostly pineapples on top.    The service was excellent.  We like hot spicy foods so the availability of the Tabasco and Sriracha sauce was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Michelle L.,"San Marcos, CA",1,8,2,4.0,10/6/2017,"This place was pretty packed for a Thursday night, my family and I had to wait about 25 minutes before we were seated. Besides the wait, the service was amazing and the food was good. Our waiter made sure our water cup was always full, something I really appreciate since most places aren't so attentive with that. The waiter also brought my stepfather a free boozie for his birthday, in addition to the one we already ordered (I highly recommend getting one of these because they're SO good. The melted cookie and ice cream goes well together). Another plus about this location is that there  are flat screen TVs everywhere, so you don't have to worry about missing a sports game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Ray G.,"Escondido, CA",1,33,,4.0,4/19/2017,First visit to BJ's and really enjoyed the brisket burger. The service (Sarah) was great. I will be back again now that I know they have good food.  Good job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Brooke B.,"Escondido, CA",182,136,61,3.0,9/23/2016,"I typically have decent service here, but the last few times I've gone I've felt like the service aspect is lacking a bit. The food is still good, and they have lots of options. I do feel like things are a little bit over-priced, but for a place like this I would expect that. Their servers need more experience perhaps. Favorites: Chicken Alfredo Pasta (w/broccoli), Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza, BBQ Chopped Salad, Chocolate Chip PAZOOKIE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
David M.,"Pauma Valley, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/3/2017,This place has always been amazing. The pizza is on a whole other level the dough is soft and airy as well as the crust. The deep dish ziti is the second best thing on the menu the different flavors from the meats and cheese and pasta go together well. You can't go to BJ's without getting a pazookie and the best one of them all is the peanut butter pazookie. This place is always busy for a reason.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40

Samuel D.,"San Diego, CA",100,291,1419,3.0,1/27/2016,"Came here a couple times before making a current update and this BJ's location sure has earned another star.  First occasion was again with a large party. Notice that the waiters at our table were very attentive especially to late comers in the party. Communication was constant and friendly; I was quite impressed. Food came out quickly fresh and quickly.   -Ahi Salad (a very large salad with plenty of fresh ahi, worth trying if you like ahi) The most recent time coming here was for happy hour. Open seating in the bar area. Great service and delicious food. Ordered a couple special drinks however, they could use better mixes.  Started off with... -BJ's Bloody Mary (you can totally tell it was not mixed well. Came straight from premade juice. NOT recommended) -Long Island (was made perfectly) -A Drink Like That (not a very refreshing drink. has a bitter taste that doesnt go down well) Venture out with Grey Goose Vodka, BACARDI 151 Rum, DeKuyper Pucker Sour Apple, DeKuyper Pucker Island Punch, BJ's fresh sweet & sour and a splash of Sierra Mist.  Appetizers -Margarita Flat Bread (light. crisp. love that basil; gives a nice flavor of ingredients) -NEW Lemon Pepper Dry Rub Wings (my fave. so crispy, tender, meaty, and seasoned perfectly. if you love wings this is a must try) -shoe string fries (came out nice a crisp) Ended with the classic chocolate chunk pizookie; i noticed that it did take quite awhile to get to our table (cannot go wrong with this dessert) Again service was great during happy hour; attentive, we didn't feel rushed. Waiter was patient and was very informative on drinks. Keep it up BJ's Esco! Will be sure to update again on my next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Matthew K.,"Barksdale AFB, LA",1,9,1,2.0,9/17/2017,Came in from Florida to visit my mom in the hospital. We decided to go there after she got out. She ordered ribs with a side of green beans. Nothing is worse then watching your mom pull out a long blonde hair from her mouth with the green beans. Makes you gag and check everyone's food. We ordered a pizookie and this time I dived into the monkey bread one and sure enough another blonde hair. Definitely won't be eating here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40

Danielle T.,"Garden Grove, CA",137,6,,1.0,9/26/2017,"I ordered to go from here and they made my pizza wrong, a bjs favorite with cheese, when I ordered it without cheese. I brought it back in and asked for them to remake it with no cheese. It was not even the same pizza !!! I got a gluten free crust with no cheese and only veggies. I waited 40 mins to get some food I don't even want. It was not the girls fault who took my order; i saw her type it in ""no cheese"". I am a server in an extremely high volume restaurant, and there's no reason to get an order wrong twice. So it's the kitchens fault for sure. Bottom line is, i have 1 pizza I can't eat with cheese and 1 that tastes gross that I don't even want. So it would be awesome if I could get a pizza I do want or a refund.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=40
Stephanie P.,"San Diego, CA",8,29,21,4.0,1/30/2017,"This past Friday we ordered for pick up and informed it would be ready by 710 pm. We arrive at 715 to pick up the food, pay and are told it would be right out. Well, 20 minutes pass and I'm still waiting for the food to come out. Not too pleased with the wait because it defeats the purpose of getting food to go and why even indicate a 710 pm pick up time if it's not even close to being ready. Because I recently had a baby who was waiting inside the car with my fiancé, (the whole reason we couldn't dine it and ordered to go) I ask to speak to a manager for an explanation as to what the delay was. To my surprise, she comped both our meals for the inconvenience of our visit/order that evening. The Customer service exceeded my expectations in resolving the issue we encountered. My fiancé and I love it here and have been to this location several times now and have never been disappointed. The food is always great, no matter what we order and management/staff has proven great customer service.

They have a great beer selection and their own brew.  I would suggest sampling before you buy a glass to make sure its your taste.  BJ'S brewed beer is only available at BJ's it is not sold anywhere else and you cannot get a growler of it.  I did notice another patron sipping on champagne by the glass next to me, so there are options.

Matt W.,"San Jose, CA",53,17,,4.0,1/1/2018,"I frequently go to a few different BJ's in Northern California and this was my first time eating this one in Escondido, while in the area, visiting family and friends. We had a large group of 15 for dinner and had to wait longer than the time we asked for when we called a couple of hours earlier, but Adam quickly got us seated when a table was available and was very apologetic about our wait. Kristijian was our server and he did an awesome job, especially with our large group.  Not only did he have a great personality, he was very attentive and made sure that everything was good for us.  He's probably one of the best servers I've encountered at any BJ's.  I just hope the experience will be similar if I ever go to this location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido
Michael L.,"San Diego, CA",3,1,,1.0,1/12/2018,"I've been to this location 2 or 3 times in 4 years, and each time has been disappointing. One visit we had a larger party, but our waitress seemed to disappear for 40 mins after saying she would be back for water refills. We got to the point that everyone's glasses were empty and had to flag down a random waiter. Eventually someone came as the replacement waiter while our original waitress was going on break. My most recent visit we were delivered the wrong pizza. Our waiter seemed to be in a rush the whole time on a not so busy day. The kitchen seemed a bit out of sync as we were originally delivered a small pepperoni that my friend mentioned wasn't ours and seemed to upset the guy bringing us our food as he replied back with a rude tone as if we didn't know what we ordered. Only to have another wrong pizza delivered by our waiter himself. Our pizza was a half bbq chicken and half chicken bacon ranch. We started with the bbq chicken as none of us at the table have tried the chicken bacon ranch to know what it looked like and just believed our rushing waiter. We didn't notice the mistake until we ate half the pizza and didn't have the normal ""How's everything tasting"" to mention the mistake. Near the end of our meal another waitress made a comment about us having the wrong pizza delivered and continued on. We then noticed our waiter walking by us in a jacket with a beer and a replacement waitress tells us our waiter is on his lunch break. I've had no issues at the La Jolla or Mission Valley locations, but this location every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido
Marcus F.,"Escondido, CA",257,1904,3182,1.0,11/19/2017,"Terrible service from their opening 8 years ago through today. I've given them a pass over the years but tonight's visit will be my last visit ever at this location. I can deal with a mixup or two, or a wait, but we were held hostage here for two hours because everything took forever. Ordering, drinks, appetizers, salad, pizza, bill, box, picking up credit card, all had longer waits than Disneyland during the summer.. NOT fun with restless kids. - 2 hour stay - 40 mins till appetizers were served - 20 minutes waiting for box and bill - Server forgot to pickup our credit card. Had to flag him down... Tip - While you're waiting forever for everything here, relax and read the endless negative reviews for this BJ's. You'll get some good chuckles in at least. -",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido
Kevin H.,"San Marcos, CA",2,66,108,1.0,10/15/2017,"Before reading this review please note that I accept the following: BJs is a fairly large chain restaurant and therefore quality can suffer. We originally came here to have a pint of the pumpkin ale and an appetizer. Upon ordering the pumpkin ale we were told ""that it is not working."" How does beer not work!?!? Disappointed, we ordered other BJ beers because it was happy hour and we were put in an awkward situation. We also ordered chips and guacamole which took 30 minutes to arrive. After 20 mins of waiting, we inquired with our waitress to our chips whereabouts only to be told they needed to make more guacamole and it would take 10 mins. Where is the communication waitress? The waitress did bring us free salsa for waiting, which was nice. The guac had cucumbers in it, which I found odd. After eating chips, we regrettably decided to order dinner and another beer. I watched my beer sit at the bar for at least 10 minutes while our waitress continually walked past the beer. Once our food arrived it was decent, but like I said, I accept that I'm at BJs. The total was pretty cheap as it was happy hour. I left BJs pretty upset and disappointed. They didn't have the pumpkin ale, chips took forever, and my beer sat at the bar for far too long. The customer service was pathetic. I'm not going to come back for a while. Sorry BJs, I am disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido

There was a hair on a shrimp on my son in laws meal....they remade it and took it off the bill.  He didn't like it...and didn't eat it.  Too salty.  Other food was salty.  My soup was bland.

Darline D.,"Escondido, CA",393,205,599,4.0,6/20/2017,"I've only gone here for birthday dinners or for late night happy hour. I've yet to try their brunch which I hear is amazing...will have to update after I've done so. What's great is that they have a pretty large menu with just as much offerings of low cal ""enlightenment"" eats as they have pizzas and that's saying a lot.  It's not the generic salad or anything like that...it's pretty substantial. I love their maple salmon pita on that part of the menu...so delicious you barely know it's better for you. Their pizzas have that good cheese elasticity when you pull away from the pie and have a nice crispy crust that you would get from a pan pizza. A large variety of beers in house and from other breweries on tap and in bottles from fruit to spice to hops and double IPAs. Seriously there's something for everyone. Love their Snakebite which is a mix of Guinness and cider as well as their Berry cider in mixed cocktails. Now I know I said I come here for late night happy hours...I don't necessarily order any of their appetizers so I don't know how they taste. I just get their beers, enlightened items, pizza, and pizookies. Oh pizookies....what are those, you say? They're like little cookies in a mini pizza pan, a la mode, and there are a couple of flavors. My favorite has to be their white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. If you are a chocolate fan, I'd recommend their Godiva pizookie. It's definitely chock-full of chocolate from cookie to topping. If you have a large party or a couple of kids who can eat a lot of dessert, you should totally order the party sized pizookie. The thing is massive and has 3 scoops of ice cream with toppings. We had our table of 6 (2 who can eat just about everything) and could barely finish it after a dinner.

It was really delectable and I can't really say anything other than to just order and see for yourself. Dessert was a cookies and cream pizookie! Regular size was enough to share with three people. Comes with an ample amount of ice cream along with a small cookies and cream flavored whip cream (pure sugary bliss right there). It got a little sweet at the end so sharing is recommended.

M. Angela C.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,3.0,4/14/2017,I am completely aware that in the hospitality industry attractiveness is always a plus especially when you are the first face customers see when they walk in. Unfortunately sometimes attractiveness and professionalism don't always go hand in hand. We walked in on a Wednesday night after 8P to find five guys blocking the reception area and chatting it up with the pretty blonde hostess. We stood there for a few minutes thinking she would be professional enough to acknowledge us but that was not the case. Not until we actually step in front of one of the guys she was chatting with did she even bother looking in our direction.  The three stars are for our server Thomas. He was amazing and most importantly PROFESSIONAL even tho he was super busy he made time to ask how we were doing and that we had everything we ordered or needed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=60

Today, however, we had one of the worst restaurant experiences ever and we will never return(to this location). Ordered a burger for me and a chicken sandwich for my husband. I always order my burgers plain. After waiting an excessive amount of time, I get my burger.. with everything on it. No problem, mistakes happen right?! Sent it back while my husband waits with his sandwich. Comes back and it was the same burger, the bottom bread was completely soggy and it tasted like lettuce.. onions all in the cheese! Seriously?! And after it was dropped off, we sat.. and sat and sat. Over 30 minutes go by and my husband has at this point eaten his sandwich and I have eaten a couple fries. No one ever comes back and my husband gets up to finally tell them we have had enough. I don't even want another burger, just to leave as quickly as possible. The waitress brings the check out and apologizes she forgot us. At least they take the burger off we didn't eat :/ We couldn't believe the horrible service we received, and no manager to apologize.

Roland C.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,16,3.0,7/23/2017,"On our last visit we went on a Sunday and restaurant was half full....there were 6 in our party and service was incredibly slow... took almost 10 minutes to even be acknowledged and get waters.. There was plenty of staff around but for some reason the waiters and hostess were very inefficient about serving their respective tables.. Took another 15 minutes after we got water to get our food order placed and then over 30 mins to get our food to us.. again the restaurant was at around 50% capacity ...  As the food came around and we were eating my mother noticed how meager the Mahi mahi fish portions were in her fish tacos... probably total of two ounces if not less.. we made a comment to the waiter who acknowledged that it was not normally like that. The manager came around 10 mins later and was kind enough to remove it from the bill... What was most frustrating came when we asked for the check... I kid you not almost 20 mins came by and we still had not received it... I had to walk over to one of the computer stations  where orders are inputed and asked to pay immediately.. Ultimately we were there for 2 hours and it was not due to awesome conversation and great story telling , but due to abnormally long wait times... hopefully management will start to recognize this problem and address it accordingly",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=60

Our food came out in 40 minutes and no silverware or placemats were provided...   We tried flagging down our waiter but they were too busy with other tables. We definitely felt under appreciated here. Maybe takeout is the way to go here. Update: Gave this place another try and it looks as though it hasn't changed. Our waitress seemed very unattentive and never once checked in on us to see how our meals were. The bartender who brought out our drinks had to track down our waitress to let her know our order was wrong.  We came in on the Wednesday burger night and ordered 4 burgers. When asked how we wanted our burgers we requested 2 of them to be medium and the other 2 well done.

I like their beers! I usually get the girly fruity one which is always pink. Can't think of the name currently & my husband usually goes with a lager or an IPA. On all of the occasions we were here I am almost positive we get the calamari since its so crispy. Maybe not my favorite place to get calamari But I like quality and quantity and here it is just right. One time we ordered the fried potato skins and that was pretty awesome since I never had them here before and they were so delicious I almost passed out. I am all about textures and I remember these still to this day because as soon as the plate arrived I thought they were burned they looked a little darker than what I am used to with potato skins. They are very hearty and bigger than what I am used to also. But when I took that first bite my eyes grew wide and my husband and I smiled at each other like little kids. I wanted to order another order but I could already feel the Jiggle coming along.

For appetizers I recommend the potstickers but skip the fried avocado roll. Potstickers are actually fresher and tastier than even the most expensive Chinese restaurants in North County. The chicken avocado club is generous and delicious and a value at $11 and you can substitute any salad for the fries. Weekdays, BJ's brand beers are only $3.95 and there are at least 8 choices. Not many places have pints of beer for less than four bucks anymore. The Thursday special of a full slab of baby back ribs with three sides and dessert is a real deal at $18.95! Really can't see why some people complain when all you have to do is mention you're not happy with something and they couldn't be nicer about fixing it 100%.

Today we went to this BJ's and we were served by Steven W.  Steven was slow getting the water. I ordered the lunch special buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich and added the drink and ENDLESS fries for $1 extra. My wife got a pepperoni pizza and a wedge salad. The salad arrived 30 seconds before the rest of the food and had very little dressing, bacon or tomatoes. We asked Steven to get more dressing for us but it never arrived. The food was pretty decent but I soon ran out of soda and my wife ran out of water. We had to start drinking our kid's waters. We did not see Steven again until we were done eating. I wanted more fries but never had a chance to ask because Steven never came by. We would watch him talk to other tables, stand around, and walk very slowly from place to place around the restaurant. He had no sense of urgency and my wife had to take our kids to the car because we had finished and waited at the table 10 minutes just sitting there waiting for the check.  Once Steven delivered the check he realized his failure and gave me his goodbye speech even though I had not paid yet. I immediately put my card in the check holder but Steven had already walked away. I waited approximately 8-10 minutes for Steven to return to the table, he picked up the bill and card and went into the back. He reappeared without my card or the bill and slowly walked around the restaurant with no sense of urgency. Another 10 minutes went by before he returned with my check. I was a server for three years and my wife was a server for 5 years and neither of us have ever had such bad service. It took us an hour and fifteen minutes to eat two lunch specials and get out of the restaurant.

Good stuff: The pizza is great.  We almost always get pizza when we're here, and they do it very well.  It's deep dish style and I haven't had one that I didn't like.  I don't have much to report about other entrees. The menu is epicly long.  There's just too much to look through for one sitting.  They do have a full bar, but I've had mixed results with the strength of the mixed drinks here.  The beers are hard to go wrong with.  The wait can be hit or miss.  I don't eat here often enough to figure out when they're busy, so sometimes it's emptier than we thought, and others the wait is so long that we end up leaving. Service has always been average.  Never had an experience worth writing much about.  This last time we had to wait a little while to meet the server for drinks, and everything after that was standard.  I'll give it an A-OK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=120

(yes, we made reservations) Since there aren't too many restaurants that can handle such a huge group, we decided to come to BJ's. There were some misses, orders were a bit slow to come out and a couple of us got overlooked at first, but overall it was pretty good. The servers worked really hard and were also successful in matching up all the parents and children sitting at separate tables.  The food was very greasy and mediocre. I ordered a bacon cheese burger, the beef was under seasoned, and overall not super delicious. This was the general consensus of the table. I also had a cookies and cream sundae which was pretty decent.  Overall the food wasn't that great, and the service was good.

Amber G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",139,8,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"If I could give negative stars I would.Last night was the last time I will ever be visiting a BJs. A lot of people I know already don't go there because the service is ALWAYS bad but I still try to go because I really enjoy the beer and food. I have never been so angry at a restaurant before in my life. It took a long time for my mom and I to even get our order placed because the waitress came by to take it then said hold on and honestly disappeared for about 5 minutes. That is when we should have known to leave. My mom and I both ordered the same burger, the late night burger. After 30 minutes of placing our order our server comes up to us and says the kitchen just told me we are out of the late night burger. We have already been waiting for a little over 30 minutes and this is the first time we are hearing of this. She said the manager would be right by and we can place another order. So we put in another good order because we were starving. No manager ever showed up, then 2 minutes after placing our new order, the burgers we first ordered came out. We were confused. So they weren't out of the burger they just didn't want to make it? I cut into mine and it's cooked way over well done but I was so hungry at this point. The manager, Adam, finally waltz his way over to us. All he says awkwardly is, talk to me. I tell him my complaints and how the burger is over done, not once does he even try to say let me fix that for you. All he said was oh well we have those other 2 burgers you ordered cooking still, I snapped we don't even want those. After a highly awkward encounter, I don't know how he is a manager, he can't even talk to people. He walks away saying we will take care of you guys tonight don't worry. We ask for our bill both only eating half of the burger. My daughter is extremely fussy at this point and ready to leave since it's been an hour and half already (the waitress even made a comment oh she is getting loud and ready I can tell) I wanted to say to her yeah because this entire experience has been slow and long. The first bill we received had 4 burgers on it. They never took off the burgers we ordered in replace of the burger we wanted. She comes back with the corrected bill and nothing is taken off. Not even a single burger. So the manager lied straight to our faces. Luckily we had a coupon for buy one get one but our bill was still 30$ because we each had a beer. We finally left after 2 hours of being there. The service was terrible all around, the manager needs to get a new job because managing is definitely not his strong suite, and that whole staff needs to be retrained. They ran food to the wrong table 3 times while we were there. This place needs fixed up and Adam should not be a manager!

When she finally came to give us our check we asked if we can split the check evenly and she seemed a bit annoyed. It's 2017 so splitting a check is not new to this industry. We asked her if she can apply the rewards points to a loyalty card which we provided instead of the account that was on file (used the app to book seats so that's the account that was on the receipt). adalie went to charge us and came back saying the loyalty points were successfully applied to the card even though the receipt confirmed it was to the wrong account. When we wanted to confirm she walked away from us mid conversation as if she had more important things to attend to.

My boyfriend and I came to this location for dinner and when we went up to the podium to give them our name, they told us it would be about 15-20 minutes until we were seated. We sat down and waited for at least 30-40 minutes. We didn't make a big deal about this since it was a Saturday night. Our name was called and the girl calling the names said one of her coworkers would take us to our table.  We stood there waiting for about 5 minutes while her and her coworkers were having a conversation about their personal lives until my boyfriend, who was fed up at this point, asked if they were ready to seat us. The girl who had called our name told us they were waiting for our table to be cleaned off.  Finally after standing for 10 minutes of more waiting, one of the girls took us to our table. The table was still dirty when we sat down. It still had water rings from cups and salt on it, so obviously they hadn't been cleaning it off.  We had been sitting there for 5 minutes and no one had come up to ask us for or order or even what we wanted to drink. We waited for about 15 minutes as we watched a few people around us, who had been seated after us, get their order taken. Annoyed, we decided to leave the restaurant after wasting over an hour waiting.  It's pretty safe to say I won't be visiting this location again.

Brian G.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,2,3.0,2/18/2016,"Let me start off by saying we've been to this BJ's on multiple occasions, probably over 15 times in the past 6 years or so - this rating is based on a cumulative experience over those years. The service is really a hit or miss. Sometimes our waiters are awesome and super helpful with choices especially since the menu changes on a regular basis or because there is so much to choose from. Unfortunately, the service can also be a nightmare. On one occasion it took 45 minutes to get our food for a party of 8 and there was no feedback from our server other than ""it'll be out soon."" Most recently, we went on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30 for a party of 10. We were seated even before being assigned a waiter - we couldn't get anyone's attention to help us out and when we finally did, the waiter was surprised no one was helping and said, ""I guess I'll be your server then."" She was great, but it's stuff like that that you just have to question the service. The beer selection is great! So much to choose from, both in-house, local, and national. The in-house beer is OK, but I'll stick to the SD breweries instead. A variety of food to select from but it is often overwhelming. There is definitely something for everyone so it makes getting a large group together easy because everyone can have something they like. Only downfall? See the upper section about the service - it seems the more people in your group the more difficult the service. Overall, it's a chain restaurant that works and if we had another choice that everyone in the family liked, we would go there instead. I guess we're just comfortable with BJ's, I just wish their service was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140
Adam L.,"San Marcos, CA",1,9,7,3.0,5/22/2016,"Great selection as usual for food. Beers aren't bad either.  We ordered boneless wings which could be topped off with some of the sauce it's cooked in. BJS Favorite Pizza was good except for the large onion pieces and some of them were the inedible outside of the onion. Kids Mac N Cheese could be house made as opposed to being just ""blue box"" Kraft Mac n cheese that goes for $1 at the store. The wife got the Ahi salad and the flavors were good and tuna cooked perfectly. However they drenched the salad to the point where you couldn't eat it really without it tasting like just dressing. Service here for me has always been hit or miss. Ultimately, IMO, you come for the pizza and stay for the PIZOOKIE!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140

Considering how busy they were it did not take very long to get our order placed. But it did take a long time for our dinner to arrive. And apparently it had been sitting for a while because my steak was lukewarm at best. The ribeye steak was tasty and a good size also it was cooked the way I like it. But it was very tough and I had to saw several pieces of it. It was not what I expected when I paid almost $25 for it. My sides were mashed potatoes and broccoli, the mashed potatoes were good and the broccoli was tender and tasty but a very small portion. Broccoli is cheap and I would've thought that they would've almost smothered the dish with it. I almost forgot, we had to ask for flatware. There was none on the table and none arrived with our meals. Which meant that we had to wait to eat because we had nothing to eat or dishes with. But the flatware arrived shortly after we asked for it. Well I return?

Stephanie Z.,"Escondido, CA",116,248,377,3.0,3/14/2016,"BJ's is the place to go when nobody can agree on what they want. BJ's basically has everything. Their menu is huge! The food hasn't disappointed me. We typically spend about  $100 when we come here for our family- appetizer/desserts included. Their pazzoki's are amazing! Love their pick 3 deal. Service is usually great but last night service wasn't great unfortunately. It started out okay but once a large party was seated near us- we were kind of forgotten about. We had to ask someone else for drink refills, a plate for my boyfriends pizza (which took a while to come & was awkward since we all had our food & was eating). A chip refill because the $18 appetizer we ordered came with a large thing of spinach artichoke dip and maybe like 8 chips in a tiny cup (which doesn't make all that much sense to me why they do that but whatever), Our drinks refills and his plate came but our chips never did. We had to ask for it again at the end and just took it home.  We are not the kind of people to go and speak to the manager or make a huge deal and try to get anything comped- we just deal with it. However, we are 20% or more kind of tippers but in this case, we only left 18% which was still pretty generous considering the service. We are not jerks and know it's how servers make their money but at the end we both said to eachother that service wasn't that great tonight.  Maybe they should have someone else focus on smaller tables when a large party is sat??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140

The Birthday boy wanted Jambalaya but he wanted to substitute the rice for pasta and so our waitress, Amy made a few suggestions. She suggested him to add more sauce since the pasta will soak up the sauce which would make his meal dry. He also had a few questions regarding their beer as he was making his first alcohol purchase. He was going to get the beer flight, but she suggested to get their BJ's special which is served before 3pm I believe and it was a whole pint glass of beer which was a better deal. He ended up getting the special. I used the BOGO lunch entreé with my friend that I found through Yelp, but you need to have rewards card and so my friend signed up for one. Our food came out super fast. I got the GF sausage pizza w/ a Caesar salad w/out crotons lunch combo . It was a huge portion for a lunch combo so it was differently worth the price.  My friend got his free pizookie at the end since it was his birthday.  At the end, we all had to have separate checks, but Amy was very patient and good at her job.

Lam N.,"San Diego, CA",263,60,8,4.0,2/14/2015,"First of, let me preface this with the fact that I've only been to the other Location in La Jolla so I will do some comparisons of the two. When I first walked into this location I saw that this location is huge compared to the location in La Jolla. The seating was spacious and there was plenty of tables. We were seated quick and our waitress brought out waters quickly. The customer service here was top notch and our waitress often checked on us. I originally ordered a craft beer that they had ran out of so the waitress suggested Grand Cru beer that was served in a bottle. I've never tried Grand Cru before so I opted to go ahead and give it a try.  The food was brought out promptly. I had the Roast Beef Dip with regular fries. BJ's is known for their Pizookie so they are good at making it, and make it well they do. (A Pizookie is basically a freshly made hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top) The Location of this BJ's is situated in North County Mall on the outskirts neighboring Macaroni Grill. There is plenty of parking as you can imagine so parking should never be a problem even at rush hour. However, this place does get full to the brim during dinner rush so I would suggest coming a little earlier than dinner to get a table. From what I saw when I was there, the wait is not that long as they do have an abundance of tables. Happy hour is at the bar area only.  Overall, a good experience.

Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",916,1167,5947,3.0,4/16/2014,"My best friend Kendra wanted to meet up this past Monday night to catch up, and as she lives near the area, she suggested BJ's.  While I had been burned by a past experience at the location near my girlfriend's place (here's my review:  ), I figured I'd give this location the benefit of the doubt. We started with an order of the calamari - this was quite tasty, what with the lightly breaded tentacles and rings along with the marinara and aioli sauces.  I could easily have polished off the appetizer on my own... fortunately Kendra was there to help out! Kendra ordered a mini Great White pizza: made with Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast, this looked rather delicious, though she couldn't finish it. Meanwhile, I had gone with one of BJ's Enlightened entrees (both for the under 795 calorie count and the prices; most of the menu is rather overpriced, in my opinon) - their Barbecue Bison Burger.  This was made with lean, ground buffalo, boldly seasoned and grilled (mine was medium well), then topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo, then served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce.  It's also served alongside a tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinagrette and topped with green onions.  Surprisingly, this wasn't too bad - I've had buffalo burgers before, so I was used to the taste, and in fact I put the slaw in the burger to give it a little extra oomph. The venue itself is pretty roomy and clean, and the servers were quite attentive while we were there.  Also, BJ's has a revolving glass door... which I nearly bumped into while going inside. Not too bad overall, though those prices could be a bit more affordable.  Still, I can see myself coming back to this location for a happy ending - a happy ending in this case being a Pizookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140
Wendy H.,"San Marcos, CA",394,421,876,3.0,11/14/2015,"I had a weird experience that made me review this place once and for all. It seems that the food was good, the service was wonderful but the experience was sub par. Here is what happened. It was a Friday night so of course they are packed. We waited and seating opened up in the bar so we sat in there. We ordered our beers and were fine with the noise level of the bar except for some patrons which were playing their laptop at a very high noise level. My friend went to tell the manager. This is where it went left. I Don't want to put the wrong manager name so its the bigger dude with the beard. First off he tells her to hold on he is busy. STRIKE ONE, when a customer says there is a problem you face the customer. Next she asks him to please handle it, and allow the customers know politely its bothering us, and please turn it down. He told her he cant actually do that, so she came back and asked them herself. The customers were apologetic and did it right away! NO big deal, everyone is happy. Until... the manager walks over and checks on them! WTF? I say we handled it since you would not! He then turns his back on us and continues to talk to them. Never once talking or checking on us, and also making it into a bigger deal then need be since everyone was okay by then. A couple of patrons actually turned around and thanked us, because it was louder then the game.   STRIKE TWO is to ignore us. Then another manager (maybe the real one or GM) comes over and talks to them about it again. OKAY this is just getting embarrassing for everyone involved. Once again no one checked on us. Two chicks that threw down 60 bucks for dinner, and a really weird awful experience. I like the pazookie and our real waitress (wish I had gotten her name) was wonderful.

Idrees T.,"Murrieta, CA",3,12,1,1.0,4/11/2017,"Would give this review 0 Stars if I could. Let me preface this before and say that I NEVER complain no matter how bad the service is. Tonight, however was different. We arrived to bjs on a Tuesday night at 830 pm. We got sat very quickly, but that was the only good part of the night. My girlfriend and I sat there for 30 minutes and didn't even get a greeting to let us know that they acknowledged us as paying customers. I finally mustered up the courage to let the hostess now that we haven't even gotten water, let alone greeted. Another server heard this and she jumped to the occasion to help, even though it wasn't her section (she's awesome) . After finally getting our orders I thought that it was the turning point, well I was wrong. Not only did my girlfriend find TWO pieces of hair in her pizza, but I never even got asked if I wanted any more water or another beer (which I did). So after, I spoke to the manager RON. I let him know that I never ever complain at restaurants, but I just wanted to let him know how the service went. He joked and said, ""I'm glad I can make history"". Funny, but not the response I was hoping for. He said he would help with some of the bill, which I didn't care for but thought was a nice gesture. Turns out that nothing was done. Will never come back to this bjs again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140
C S.,"Escondido, CA",0,23,,2.0,1/4/2016,"My fiance and I visited BJ's with 6 of our closest friends for our birthdays in November. I want to start this review by saying that we are a crowd of extemely lax people. We all have worked in customer service in some capacity, most of us have restaurant experience of some sort. To start, our server did not even come by the table to introduce herself (she will remain nameless, to spare her embarrassment) until 20 minutes after we were seated. I am not exaggerating. OTHER servers kept telling us she would ""be with us shortly."" When she did come, we explained immediately that we were all on separate checks, which I know can be a hassle--why we explained it upfront. She numbered us all off and told us to remember our numbers for the rest of our dinner. Mind you, none of us have a memory problem. I just thought this was extremely odd and very tacky. (She wasn't kidding. I forgot my number at one point, and she was irritated with me and had me repeat back everything on my tab so she could give me a new ""number"") We all ordered drinks at the same time. They all came out in a seemingly haphazard order, and separately. My friend's flight of beers came out before my easy-peezy glass of wine, and my fiance's mojitos (x3) all came out before my friend's first Long Island..?? Our food was no different. It came out haphazardly, though we all ordered at the same time. I'm not talking two-trips to the kitchen. I mean that all 8 dishes came out sporatically over the span of FORTY MINUTES. By the time I finished my food, my fiance was just getting his. We ordered the same dish. Now- my real beef. My brother ordered a sandwich and fries. SO easy. He waited 45 minutes. Then at the hour mark, we asked the server where it was. She quickly replied it was ""dead"" and there would be another up shortly. We asked the manager to please come talk to us, we had had enough. We calmly and politely explained the situation to her, and she retorted that she appreciated our concern, but the employee had done ""the right thing"" and she would be happy to offer it at a discount for us if we were truly upset by the situation. I'm SORRY. In WHAT WORLD does neglecting your customers' food to the point that it is declared ""dead"" and then putting in an order for a new one to correct your mistake count as ""the right thing""?!?  We weren't looking for any freebies. But a sincere, honest apology would have been nice. We will not be back. Shame, because we liked this place up until this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140

Ricky L.,"San Diego, CA",362,25,113,2.0,1/20/2015,"Last week I had dinner with my girlfriend at BJ's for my birthday.  I wanted to go here because I enjoy the food and more importantly, I wanted to have some pizookies for my birthday!  Who wouldn't?  Unfortunately, my experience here was rather saddening.   Before we were seated, I went to the restroom.  While I was in the restroom, my girlfriend told the lady at the front table that she wanted to order the pizookie trio for my birthday before we were seated (so that she wouldn't have to order it in front of me and I would be surprised when it came out).   We were then seated and our orders were taken by the kind waiter.  As he brought out the appetizer, he also brought the pizookies.  We were confused because pizookies should come after dinner as a dessert.  We asked him to bring that back into the kitchen and my girlfriend was quite embarrassed now that the surprise was spoiled.  The waiter looked flustered as he had to return pizookies and his mood went south.  From that point on, our service from the waiter was very poor.  He did not check on us or even refill our waters.  He ignored us.  After we had our meal, the pizookies were brought back out and he just left it on the table and leaving my girlfriend to sing me happy birthday (I would have expected the staff to sing me a birthday song at least).  Needless to say, I will not be attending this BJ's location for my birthday anymore. Poor service aside, the food was great and the location was clean and very well maintained.  We had the calamari for the appetizer.  This crispy treat was served with both marinara and tartar sauce.  For the entrée, I had the parmesan crusted chicken.  The chicken was sliced thin and lightly crusted with parmesan.  The flavor was amazing.  This was served on top of hearty mashed potatoes; a perfect pairing.  My girlfriend had the jambalaya which was also delicious.  It was a big bowl of southern goodness.  The shrimp, sausage, rice, and spices were very fresh.  These 3 dishes are highly recommended.  Finally, we had 3 pizookies: chocolate, white chocolate macadamia, and oreo.  The chocolate was a little too sweet for my taste.  The white chocolate and oreo are my favorite and they are a must have! In conclusion, the food at BJ's was great as always.  However, in this particular case, the service was beyond poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=140

I stayed with Grandma and my 6 year old daughter still on the table drench with water.  The server comes back and wiped my iPad and our table and immediately offered us to move to another booth. I went to the bathroom and cleaned up and dried my pants. It has been awhile that we were there because my husband wouldn't come in because the baby got really fussy. We don't know if we wanted to order or what are we going to do since My pants  still wet.  Finally the manager came and talked to us.

We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for our waiter to return to take our food order.  The waiter only took half of our orders and returned slightly later to get the remaining food orders. I received my plate a full 20 minutes prior to the rest of the table! Seriously, there were 3 orders for salads and my salmon dish came out 20 minutes before theirs. By the time the rest of the table received their orders, the salmon dish was cold and I asked to have the dish reheated only to have it be the worst dish I have ever ordered.

Finally, we approached the hostess stand and she blamed it on a broker beeper...not a good start to the night.  We were a given a table in the middle of the restaurant but no one checked on us for 15min! No server introduced themselves or anything, until a friendly server/bus boy helped us out. Eventually our server for the section came by and served us. She was friendly and said there was a miscommunication amongst servers. Ugh.. Finally we ordered and our food came very fast, which was nice! My gf and I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with mash potatoes and broccoli. It's always a good meal and have never been let down, until this experience. Chicken and potatoes were good, but the broccoli wasn't cooked or anything. It was like it came straight out of the ground. It was really bad, dry, inedible to say the least. Our server apologized and offered to replace the broccoli with a different side which we did, fries.

All the Parmesan was on the plate didn't even coat and stick on. The wing was extra salty and between the two of us we only had 1/3 of the serving portion.

Randy S.,"San Diego, CA",215,138,471,2.0,4/27/2015,"Come because you hear its good food... but leave before you get it because of the service. Pros: Entrees are good. Especially the pizza and bazooki (dessert pizza). Multiple TVs with main sport events Bar area is pretty chill. Not that crowded at this location. Cons: Service - both host area and waiting staff. Too many stuff to put. Parking - not really that bad, it just shares the same lot as North County Westfield mall, so beware of crazy drivers/parkers. Appetizers - hit or strikes... mostly strikes Pre-game disclaimer: First off, since this is a franchise, i wont get into too much of the taste of the food because they ""should"" all be similar... unless drastically different.  For the detailed review,  im going off my multiple times i have been there.  Pre-game night scenario that made me write this review: It's a semi-cold and rainy evening/night in SD. Was set to have a dinner with my partner and her brother, yay. We anticipated a long wait because it was a Friday night, but we didn't anticipate it bejng Prom night. So along with families waiting to be seated, there were groups of ""high fashion"" prom-dressed students waiting eagerly to get their grub on and head to their dance (... why would you go to BJ's for a ""fancy"" prom dinner?! Idk).  Pitching against BJ's... Randy's review!!! Host area: please be honest. If it is going to take about a number of minutes to be seated, it is alright if it is off by +/- 5 or 15 minutes.  If i am told 30 minutes, i am expecting to bs seated no later than about 45 minutes... not be seated after 1 hour.  I understand maybe it is one of those nights where it is busy, hell, its prom night. You would think that since more and more people are packing the lobby the wait time would increase... nope. The host person would tell every group ""it will be about 30min, give or take a few minutes""... yeah... give or take about 1 hour.  Server: most people would agree with me (maybe, i don't know you so yeah, whatever, keep reading) when i say service will make or break the time and reputation of a place. And i fully understand being under stressful and crowded times where a server or worker might forget to check in with a customer/guest.  My friends would say im a very patient guy, even when i am ""hangry,"" so i will yield a few strikes before opting people out...  Counting the couple of times i have been to this location, i got this type of service: Young and overwhelmed - not all young servers/workers are like this... it just so happened the times i came here, i had this. Ball one!... not their fault thise nights were hectic. Passive aggresive - we ordered our drinks and appetizers, then we were asked if we were ready to order entrees. When we said we would need a minute, a look of ""come on really?!"" Accompanied with their eyes rolling as they walked away... strike one! Shortly after receiving our drinks, our appetizers and sweetners/sugars were dropped off... literally dropped.  Food shifted and sweetners and sugar came out of the can. Strike two! When given our drinks and appetizers, the server quickly left without taking out entree order and quickly went to another table to take their orders... mind you, it is a table that came after us and had more females. Strike three! Okay... this is how patient i was... i waited for 1 more strike. Yeah. My ""out"" equals 4-strikes. And what happened?... server walked by me when i put my hand up to get their attention. I understand if i just rose my hand right when they were next to me, but the server was 15-20 yards away, looked at me, and quickly turned away walking towards me with their head facing to his left... really?! I dont think i am anywhere near intimidating, if anything that was my brother-in-law. Strike four = bad review.  Realizing they messed up or they were going to get a bad tip: after all that, my group was pissed. We only got our drinks and appetizers. No plates with the appetizers. And not even our entrees ordered. So my brother-in-law actually got up and went to the back go get plates for ourselves. When our server saw him walk back with plates you can see the ""$*** i messed up"" look on his face. Everything after that, they tried to make things better, but not even admit ""sorry for the delay"" or anything like that.  Did anyone step their game up? Yes, actually. Someone did. And it was the food runner or kitchen staff from the kitchen (they were wearing an apron when they brought us our entrees). Kudos to you kitchen staff. Half-star to you.  Food: Its good... its good enough just to make this review a 2-star review from a 1-star if it was only based on service... but i want to be nice.  Would i come back?  Most likely not. If i do, it would be only if im in the area, craving pizza, and between 2pm-4pm during the weekday.  Am i being too nice? Yes...  yes. I.

Ordered the kids lemonade but the waitress put it in as full orders.  :(  Hubby got a beer and I got a pinapple moscow mule which i liked. Then we ordered the kids corn dogs to share with 2 ketchups and one 1 came out so we had to ask for another ketchup again.  That happens often... I got the steak medallions with mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  Very yummy.  Highly recommend it.  The steaks were nice and tender.  I was able to cut it with a butter knife.  I asked for it to be medium rare, but they were more like medium.  Hubby says it's hard to cook medallions since they are so small.  But they were still very good. Hubby got the tuscan chicken which he really enjoyed as well. For dessert we got the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  It has a cake bottom instead of graham cracker which I really liked.  We actually got this to go and ate it at home. Note for families about the mall - If you have kids with you, the mall has a play area and train.  We didn't do the train but we did go to the play area.  It was really crowded with kids.  They have also added family room (where mom's can go to breastfeed) and kids can watch TV or play with a couple toys while waiting.  The family room also has it's own bathroom with kid size toilet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=200

Nani G.,"Escondido, CA",18,21,7,2.0,2/24/2017,"I had the worse experience at this location. To start the host took our name down wrong and there was a 30min wait ,which we didn't mind, but when it came time to check in the new host at the front basically said we lied about it. When the host who originally took our name fixed it and we were being seated we got the dirtiest look from the host ,who called us liars. Now when our server LINDA came I have never had worse customer service. There where 3 sets of couples that came in and were able to finish they're meals pay and leave before we we're even checked on. Linda refused to check in at our table. Linda didn't bother to ask if we needed anything. Linda also refused to clear our tiny table or refill our drinks, as it was the only thing we had been served up to this point. When we where able to ask for refills she through them on the table causing them to splash or spill unapologetic Linda continued to disappear. Linda checked on us a total of 3 times after we flagged a separate server asking to cancel our order and give us the check. It took an extra hour for our food to come out, note they didn't complete our request to cancel the order instead Linda stayed away until our meal was ready. When our food finally arrived it was cold and tasteless. Linda didn't offer to reheat or remake Linda gave us our ticket and was speedy to collect the tab in hopes of a tip in all I was very dissatisfied I honestly believe she refused us the service we where do because we are an interracial couple.

When someone hunts you down to give you the payment, you know he is in a hurry. We needed to get going to make sure we got to an event on time. Stephanie, however, kept doing other stuff, like taking orders, fetching drinks, talking to another waitress, etc. It was not because she was waiting to get the bill rung up, because finally, after 10 minutes, she brought me back nine $1 bills. I do not like the trend of not getting accurate change. But I really don't like a waitress who is either oblivious or trying to stall in hopes I just gave up and left her a 45% tip.

I also have had different things both times, just to see if it was a fluke. When I'd go, I'd normally get the fresh tomato and mozzarella salad (snacks/small bites) and the stuffed mushrooms.   The last time, I had the salad and shared a pepperoni flatbread pizza. The grease was just way too heavy and it didn't agree with my stomach.  This time, I ordered their Tuscan Tomato Bisque, and they brought me Chicken Tortilla, but once they actually brought out the correct order, the top of the tomato bisque there was a ton of oil pooled at the top of the soup. I was hungry, so I attempted to strain as much of the oil off as I could, but it was a lost cause. I had to spend another hour in the bathroom :( This place used to be pretty consistently good, but now I'm afraid to eat here because I'm in immense amounts of pain I endure once I do eat there.

Alissa M.,"San Diego, CA",120,11,3,1.0,4/19/2015,"WARNING: VERY GRAPHIC. OKAY MAYBE NOT THAT GRAPHIC BUT YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ BEFORE YOU EAT HERE AS YOU MAY LOSE YOUR APPETITE. YES IT'S A NOVEL. First off, I'd like to say our waitress was a very good one. She has great CS but she should look for another restaurant to work at as for what I'm about to express, is going to be real AF. A couple of my best friends and I came here to catch up with life and wanted to share conversation over (what we expected to be) great food. This was on Wednesday (04/15/2015.) We've all been to one of many BJ's restaurants but I myself have not been to this one in 3 years. I ordered the PM Porter to go with my Black and Bleu-House Burger and shoestring fried potatoes. One of my girlfriends ordered the same but wrapped in lettuce with a side of mozzarella and tomato salad. She also ordered a diet Pepsi. My other girlfriend ordered the BJ's Brew house Burger with Applewood Smoked Bacon and Swiss cheese. Instead of fries, she upgraded to their featured Watermelon and Feta salad (extra balsamic vinegar dressing... I forgot her drink tho.) Food was tasty. No issues. Went home. Please keep in mind, we haven't seen each other in almost 2 months and this was like a reunion.  The next day (Thursday 4/16/2015) I had no appetite and was wondering why I felt a little odd. I had coffee and a piece of bread the whole day. I wake up Friday (4/17/2015) go to work at 6am. 10am rolls around and I feel nauseous. Go to the bathroom having the worst pain in my belly and great! I have diarrhea.  Walk back to my desk, having a feeling that I am not done, so I go back to the commode. When I was done, I go back to my desk. Not even 2 minutes pass by and tell my coworker this is ridiculous and now I feel I need to vomit. Low and behold, I puke a chunky waterfall. I do this from 10am to 12pm. I finally tell my boss I gotta go home.  I get home and the pain gets worse and worse. This had gone on until midnight and I finally begged my family to take me to the ER. I was given an anti emetic and morphine (Yes, the pain was that bad and my threshold for pain is actually pretty high) for the excruciating cramps. Also, attached an IV bc of all the electrolytes I had lost while vomiting, from both ends, of my body. I didn't go home until 4:30am. I then learned, it wasn't just me that almost died from someone's poor food handling but also, my two best friends had been going through the same shit. Way too much of a coincidence if you ask me. BJ's, I'm not blaming you but I will blame the son of a bitch that almost killed me and 2 of my best friends because of their neglect in food handling service. Or maybe the quality check was overlooked when preparing the food. WASH YOUR FUCKING HANDS AFTER YOU USE THE BATHROOM AND USE GLOVES BEFORE YOU PREPARE ANYONES FOOD. EVEN MAKE SURE THE FOOD ISN'T SPOILED BEFORE PREPARING IT. THE FOOD WE ATE COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO A CHILD... A CHILD WHOSE IMMUNE SYSTEM MAY NOT BE AS STRONG AS 3 GROWN WOMEN. YOU COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE! That is all. I will never come back here and I will tell 3 friends to tell their 3 friends and so on and so forth of the experience I have had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=180
Philip H.,"Poway, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/11/2015,"My mom wanted to go yesterday for mothers day. So we went and arrived around 5:45, had to wait for about 30mins to be seated, which is not too bad considering the amount of people waiting. Once we got seated it was all down hill from there, mainly due to the fact it took us over an hour to get our food. I had my child and my niece with me as well (who are both 4), so if you have kids you can imagine how impatient they can get sitting in a seat coloring for an hour.  Once we got our food, everybody said it was good, except for me who ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and received the BBQ chicken pizza, but of course I didn't want to reorder for fear having to wait another hour. Our waiter did admit that we waited a long time for our food and offered to give my mom a free salad, instead we asked for something a little more practical and asked for a free pizookie. The waiter said ok. When he came back around we actually asked for 2 pizookies, expecting 1 to be comped. When we finally got the bill, both pizookies were being charged. We asked the waiter about this, he advised his manager said they could get us a mini pizookies, but not a full size one. I find this very absurd, since  the price is not much of a difference and we were waiting for over an hour.

A R.,"Tempe, AZ",9,140,5,2.0,6/17/2015,"Maybe it was the weekend hustle, maybe it was the holiday weekend hustle.  Whatever it was, it wasn't great.   The place was super packed, we had called in about 30 mins prior to arriving to reserve a table but when we showed up the girl had not written down our reservation, so we had to wait another 40 minutes or so.  We were starving at that point, tired and grumpy otherwise we would've walked out to a fast food place.  Our server was really nice, but she started with her name and then said she was really busy, almost implying whatever service issues happened was not her fault.   We were a group of 7 and 5 of us got our drinks quickly.  The housemade root beer is always good but this time I got it in a warm cup instead of their signature frozen cup.  The extra two waters took a while to get placed in our table too and I never got a refill on my root beer throughout the night.  When we finally got our food, my mother in law had blue cheese on her wedge salad which she had asked to opt out of. Then the replacement salad came with brown lettuce so that was taken back.  The final New salad came at the end of the meal which we had to take in a container since we were all done eating by then. My chicken lettuce wraps came with brown lettuce as well, and to curve my appetite everyone gave me a little bit of their meals.  My new order with green lettuce came very very later, when everyone else was done eating (we had not received the 3rd salad yet at this point).  The waitress apologized again stating they were very busy.   My opinion is either get more servers or don't seat so many people at your restaurant if you're not prepared for the masses. We ordered a gluten free pizzookie which was good, but unfortunately when that arrived I was still halfway through my lettuce wraps dinner so I didn't get to partake.   I would've expected to at least receive a discount or a free dessert on our ticket for the delay in our dinner and the multiple issues, but we didn't. This location is near the mall, so maybe that was a bad choice for us, especially on a holiday weekend.  Everyone else stated their food was good, but service was not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=180
Joyce B.,"Oceanside, CA",109,47,110,4.0,3/8/2014,"Came around 9 pm on a Wednesday night with the bf. No wait, but no hostess at the front either. When she finally showed up, she seemed annoyed, but the business was slow. We were given a booth on the opposite side of the bar area...I wish she would've at least checked to make sure the seats had the previous diners' food cleaned off. She stared at me as I wiped food particles off the booth. No bueno. When our waiter Chuck greeted us at our table, he was so friendly and eager to please (this made up for the not-so-friendly, not-so-clean-conscious hostess).  We ordered the pint-sized PM Porter and Wyders Pear Cider which both came out in a timely manner. Shortly after, our appetizer arrived- Traditional Chicken Wings (10 wings in buffalo sauce served with ranch, extra sauce, and celery for $9.75). We also ordered a medium deep dish BBQ Chicken Pizza ($20.95).  The wings were amazing, deep-fried goodness with just the right amount of buffalo sauce and ranch drizzled over the top. They wear seasoned nicely and cooked really well. The pizza was good and had a load of toppings. There was some excess BBQ sauce which made it a little too tangy for me and slightly soggy.  Chuck the waiter was on top of things and made sure to refill drinks and check on us often. It was a slow night and staff was getting ready to wrap things up for the night, but he never rushed us. Without Chuck, I would've given this BJ's 3 stars for the not so pleasant hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=220
Angel R.,"San Diego, CA",249,133,173,4.0,3/23/2014,"I don't go here as often anymore, but I will make occasional visits. When I used to come here often it was for drinks with friends. We never sat at the bar, since the bar wouldn't accommodate the amount of food that we would order. Sometimes several plates or appetizers, and sometimes we would be really hungry and order meals along with drinks. One thing that keeps me coming back to BJ's is their Top Shelf Margaritas...upgraded with Patron of course! The bartenders at BJ's make the Top Shelf Margaritas PERFECT here; the perfect balance of citrusy/sour, good kick of tequila (not overbearing at all!), and ice. Yes, they didn't overdo it on the ice - how is that possible? Their Raspberry Lemon Drop Martini, is pretty good; but watch out, sometimes the bartenders will pour this little martini strong, rendering it impossible for either Anthony and I to finish it. And we usually like our drinks with a nice kick to them! Also the beers are very good here! The Hefeweizen is yummy with a slice of lemon, and so is the Jeremiah Red! As far as food is concerned, I haven't explored their menu in it's entirety because it's HUGE. I wouldn't consider it a menu even, a pamphlet would be more appropriate. Anyways I'm a creature of habit, so I stick with what I like and familiar with. I always enjoy the Caprese Salad, Ahi Poke, and Calamari as appetizers. For entrees I enjoy the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, Roast Beef Dip sandwich, and Lemon Thyme Chicken. The portions are always gargantuan, and I always have leftovers to take home. Makes for a yummy, substantial lunch at work! And what is a review for BJ's without mentioning their coveted pizookies? The Red Velvet one is me and Anthony's favorite. The White Chocolate Macadamia Nut pizookie is really good, and so is the Baked Beignet. I'm not too fond of the Double Chocolate or the Cookies N Cream pizookies - WAY TOO SWEET for my liking! And honestly, I rarely have any room to indulge in these because I'm always substantially full, and I don't like overstuffing myself. Since then I've learned to just come here for solely for the pizookie! No more, no less, and very enjoyable. You know, despite the reviews on this place, I have always legitimately enjoyed myself at BJ's. The waiters and waitresses were always very nice and helpful. Whether it's for lunch, dinner, or getting drinks, BJ's hasn't disappointed me yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=220
Brandie F.,"Oceanside, CA",14,8,22,1.0,12/20/2015,If I could give no stars for this review I would. Here's why. Tonight was the first time my husband and I and a friend went who is a regular to Bjs at the North County Mall shopping center in Escondido. Our waitress Aaliyah was AMAZING serving us even with the situation I encountered with our food. We started with some appetizers the Siracha queso chili verde dip and potato skins. When we got our food the dip was cold so they had to remake fortunately the potato skins were good. Second time receiving our dip everything seemed great until I started noticing I had been chewing something hard so I decided to pull it out and to my surprise took out a huge chunk of melted plastic. When we notified our waitress she notified the manager on duty Shawn who was unsympathetic towards my situation when we told her that this was the second time making the dip and now there's melted plastic which is toxic. She kept saying it was the plastic wrap from the cheese that wasn't fully unwrapped when we tried telling her that's not the big issue you don't let the wrapper melt with your dip and tell a customer it's just the wrapper from the cheese when that's a health issue. The manager didn't seem to sympathetic about what I had almost eaten and was rude about it. She did take the dip off our bill but I felt more should of been done especially for a first time customer. After that I lost my appetite and didn't want to eat my broccoli cheddar soup anymore and my friends club sandwich had soggy bread. I can definitely say this will be my first and last time going to a BJs and anyone that has had a good experience at another location beware of this one!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=220

Service can be a bit scarce, but you have to consider the number tables there are to serve vs.  the number of staff they actually have on the floor.

Got the chair but we had no elbow room... so we asked for another table and we got one! Yay more elbow room!  My girlfriend and I ordered a deep dish pizza, half great white and half five meat, and we also ordered the Alfredo pasta with the chicken and broccoli. The pasta was bomb! Pasta was al dente, the chicken was moist, and the broccoli was cooked the way I like with a little crunch to it. The pizza was pretty good as well, but nothing extraordinary. For dessert, our group all split a few of the pizookie trios so everyone was able to get their own mini pizookie. I'm a big fan of chocolate chip and my girlfriend got the Oreo cookie one! Mine was delicious! And my girlfriend's was good too I guess... I mean it was so good she didn't even save me a bite!  Food was good, pasta was bomb, and the pizookies were dank! Service was pretty good, a lot better than I expected which helped the overall experience, especially seeing the 2.5 stars. It was also very dark in the place though, and I'm not too sure why? Some spots at the table were more lit compared to others.

The reason I will never go back is the service is the worst service I have ever had in California. THE WORST! The waiter/waitress always neglects my table. They come once in between the time we order and the time we get our food. This last time I looked to see if our waitress was busy at other tables and she was no where to be seen. In fact, I didn't see any waiters or waitresses. To top it all off, when we finally got our food (40 minutes after ordering) it was cold. This tells me our food was ready well before we received it. Our waitress was occupied with something else, like chatting in the corner with the other workers.  The food is OKAY and certainly not worth dealing with the HORRIBLE service and the amount of time it takes to receive it.

Andrew C.,"Escondido, CA",130,18,3,1.0,1/1/2015,"My family and I visited the Escondido bjs recently. I was hesitant to go here due to the negative reviews, but I chose to go here based on the good reviews as well.  Well...... I just ate my Caesar salad with my bare hands. I was served the salad and had no utelsils whatsoever with which to eat it. The rumors are true, I am afraid. The simple act of keeping this establishment staffed seems to be a complete failure of the management. The eyes of the waitresses and waiters are filled with despair and stress. It is a very simple matter of under staffing.  I understand that bjs is a business which must remain profitable, but when both the employees and clients have a poor time due to what I can only deem to be management failures, then everybody loses.  As usual, the food remains fine and tasty. Also, the choice of television program is amiable, as it is holiday bowl time.  Overall experience: one half point out of five. Taste and presentation of food, four points out of five.  Overall, 1.5 points out of five. Sorry, but you need to fix a lot of issues from the management. It is unfortunate that the displeased patrons will likely take their frustrations out on overworked and poorly scheduled hard working wait-staff via poor tips for poor service due to poor staffing and overall poor management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=220

Joel C.,"Carlsbad, CA",11,90,16,3.0,4/19/2015,"Overall a good restaurant if you go early and get good waiters, etc. and one of the best BJs locations I've been to. There are some inconsistencies though: the waiters don't seat you well (next to loud people when the restaurant is empty otherwise), they play the most boring and bad pop music that doesn't fit the otherwise good atmosphere of the restaurant, the food portions very kind of significantly on each visit, the service is so-so, I've been ignored before on things like refilling water, getting me the check, etc. This time I waited over 10 mins for the check. They don't list their cocktail drink prices on the menu so you have to individually ask for pricing on a drink (they are also over priced). I would recommend going here before it gets too crowded and the lunch deals fade away (before 4 PM). It doesn't get nearly as crowded as the BJs in Carlsbad though. I would also recommend not getting pizza here, mainly because of the price, it costs like $1.50 for each additional topping, I got a deep dish pizza by mistake with several toppings and it was practically bite size for $14. Ouch. The bartenders shake drinks vigorously which dilutes the flavor, but they do it to put on a show of course as if that matters more. The beer here is pretty good, but not as good as Stone, Pizza Port, etc. obviously. I think the TVs kind of bring the place down, do people really go to a non-sports bar to watch TV? Or even leave the house to watch TV? I understand having a TV by the bar but not really beyond that.  I would recommend getting a sandwich/salad combo or a pizza salad combo for lunch, it is the best deal and makes me come back here. You can get one of those combos for under $10. P. S.  The rewards program is BS. I've used my rewards card on several visits and have spent about $60 with the rewards card getting me points. I only have 9 points, this means that at this rate you have to spend $500 in order to get to the 75 points that earns you a mere $5 off. Finally, the waiter took 80 cents as a tip when he was barely there.

My partner and I decided we were gonna get some pizookis to-go because we both had pretty bad headaches and just wanted something sweet. I ordered it on the BJ's app, and paid for it (tip included) with a pick-up time of thirty minutes from the time I placed the order.       So we get to BJ's and no one is in the to-go booth are at the hostess area, so we stand there for about 10 minutes by the time a guest tells us we should ask the bartender. So we ask the bartender and he says he didn't receive an online order. I show him the confirmation and he says to us, ""Oh, sorry, I'm retarded and must not have seen it."" At this point I'm frustrated, my partner is upset and his head was throbbing. But they said it wouldn't take long, so we waited. We sit here for about 30 minutes and no one says a word to ask, so I finally ask about our food and they say, ""Oh, sorry..its wrapped up in the back."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I'm sitting around waiting with a huge headache and you didn't even come to tell me my food is finished so I can leave.  Then he gives me my food and hassles me about paying online because he couldn't find that I did on the computer. Even though I showed him the online payment confirmation.       Completely ridiculous if you ask me, it took almost an hour to get three mini pizookis. Wish I hadn't paid ahead because then I would definitely not have given the generous tip that I did, actually wouldn't have given any tip.

Ron P.,"San Diego, CA",175,56,6,3.0,2/3/2015,"This place used to be one of my favorites to grab a slice and a pint. Not so much these days, but it beats similar places due to location and convenience. Nitty Gritty: Ambiance: Always lively and fairly easy to have conversation over a meal. The booth seating is prime for more intimate parties. Pretty typical sports bar-esque vibes. Service: It's usually hit or miss here. Sometimes we get someone super nice and attentive, while other times we get stuck without refills and the wrong order. Fairly slow overall, so bringing good company helps alleviate the building hunger. Food/Drinks: My favorite dish to get here are their deep dish pizzas. I've gone and ventured off into other realms of the menu, but have often times come up disappointed with something that's just not as satisfying or too greasy for my liking. The scampi isn't too bad though. The beers are pretty good here, so they have that going for them! I love the nutty brewnette, jeremiah red, and their hefeweizen is tasty as well.

The part that I did like about BJ's is that it felt like one of the restaurant/breweries that I frequently visited when I lived in Seattle (The Ram).

My (unexpected) fave was the Mediterranean so I'm glad I ordered it- loved the huge chunks of feta embedded in peperoncinis and olives.  Despite the long-awaited, gustatory satisfaction of BJ's deep dish pizzas, I bumped my rating to 3 stars because our initial order of the party platter pazookie came out raw! We talked to the waiter, who disagreed with us, but his manager immediately acknowledged the cookie dough was raw, apologized, and ordered another pazookie.

Heather L.,"Beckenham, London, United Kingdom",211,1018,262,3.0,9/16/2012,"A couple nights before my mom and I had lunch here, my aunt had suggested this place because we were planning on going to the mall and we all started giggling.  [insert pervy joke] here.  Fast forward to my mom picking me up after my shift at the mall and she asked if I wanted to go here for lunch.  We had never been, so I said sure. The inside is really nice and it is quite loud, so for those of you guys taking girls out on dates where you would like to get to know them and actually talk to them, I don't think this is the place... then again if it is already an awkward night out, then by all means, go here then you can both avoid talking to each other and watch t.v. as they have them all over the place.  Anyway we had to wait for a table, which I thought was a bit strange given it was almost 2 p.m. on a weekday...  and there were about 3-4 parties waiting. The hostess was friendly in seating us.  It took quite awhile for a waitress to come over and take our drink order... in fact it took so long we had already decided on our starter and our mains.  Our stuffed mushrooms came out and so did some plates, but like some other reviewers, we did not have utensils, so the waitress, upon request, went over to another table and stole the utensils off of the table.  There was no refill offered for my empty glass... actually our waitress wasn't around very often.  I thought it had to do with the large group next to us... including the store manager and district manager for the store I work for... but she wasn't serving them, so I can't figure out why she was never around. The stuffed mushrooms may have been the best part of the meal... should've ordered more of those.  Both my mom and I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos... she got both grilled and I got one grilled, one fried.  A different waiter brought out our food, still no refill on the drink.  The tacos certainly looked lovely!  They serve them with nice warm tortilla chips... mine were really good, but my mom's chips were stale!  They serve them with square containers of avocado cream and salsa... wasn't a fan of the salsa, but the avocado cream was nice. The tacos... my mom said hers tasted a bit funny, and my fried one tasted a bit funny... not sure how to describe the taste, but my grilled taco was actually ok... just not much fish at all.  And I do love cabbage/slaw on my fish tacos, but I got all of the thick, hard, bitter parts of the cabbage.  I think by the time I pulled all of those pieces out, there wasn't much garnish left on the taco :/ (maybe this speaks to the fact about how often my mind is in the gutter... but [insert pervy joke here]).  To be honest, I think I'd be willing to give the food another go, but with the service, I'm not sure that I would go out of my way or suggest it when someone asks, ""Where should we go for dinner?""  The lunch prices... well there are some items under $10, but I would say most items on the menu are over $10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=260

My mom ordered the shrimp scampi, but we had to send it back to the kitchen twice because there was literally no flavor. They offered us to choose a different item from the menu, so we got the chicken alfredo. Chicken alfredo was alright. The pizza was very doughy and didn't seem cooked. The cheese wasn't even melted all the way. So, we basically saved the whole pan and brought it home. It was good as leftovers because we used the microwave to heat it up properly. Burgers were okay but nothing great. They were both a little too dry. We got the Buffalo Brisket Burger and the Crispy Jalapeno Burger. The only thing good was the pizookie they gave us since it was my birthday. Service was also good, since they changed our order for us, but employees all seemed a bit nervous and anxious to help us. They were all relatively young, the hostess and our waiter. I really liked BJ's, but this time around, I wasn't too pleased.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=260

We ask for him to take our orders and he said that he'd be right back. 15 minutes later another waiter stops by and tells us he'll be covering for the first waiter who has gone on break. He refills two ice teas and that's the last we ever saw of him. Approximately 90 minutes after first getting there our orders were taken. Approximately 35 minutes after that our food arrives. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. It was extremely dry and well done...not the medium as advertised. The Jambalaya had whole tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce usually associated with this type meal. The rest of the meals were less than spectacular to midiocre at best. The highlight was the conversation and seeing old faces....but this could have been done at the local park.

Maddie C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/25/2017,"My husband and I recently had a terrible experience at this location. When we initially got to the restaurant we were given an estimated wait time of 30 minutes. We were pretty hungry but decided to stay anyways. 45 minutes pass and we still not been seated. I asked the host how much longer it would be and she apologized but said the wait would be another 10-15 minutes. Although we were hungry, thirsty, and now a little frustrated we gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to wait. We ended up waiting 20 more minutes bringing our total wait time to over an HOUR before we were finally given a table even though we were initially quoted 30 minutes. We were willing to look past this and finally get some drinks and food and wouldn't you believe it but we ended up sitting at the table another 10 minutes and still hadn't seen our waiter. We started grabbing our things to leave when finally our waiter swoops in to greet us. Since we had so much time to look at the menu we again gave the staff another chance and stayed. We ordered our drinks, appetizers, and entrees all at once making us what I think a pretty easy table to handle. We get our drinks and appetizer in a timely manner but guess what, we WAITED again, about 25 minutes after our appetizer for our entree. No staff had come to talk to us, we're just sitting, waiting, having no idea where our entrees or waiter were. Our food was finally delivered and at the delivery our waiter said our food was given to another table and they had started eating it so the kitchen had to remake our food. No apology was given, but our waiter informed us he had talked to the manager and had comped the up-charge on the asparagus my husband ordered. Thanks dude. All our waiting saved us $2 off our entire bill. It really felt like a slap in the face. I used to work at a restaurant and when mistakes like this were made the managers made it a point to speak to the table AND offer to take care of the appetizer with possibly a gift card to return again at a later date. It's very disappointing to see how some customers are willing to give a restaurant multiple chances only to be let down time and time again.

Kirsten D.,"Tucson, AZ",188,368,846,3.0,2/14/2013,"Let me start by saying that the food rating should be 2 star, but the service boosted the overall a bit.   Our waitress was extremely helpful, efficient, and friendly.  She was by far one of the better waitresses I've had at any restaurant in a while.  I just wish the food lived up to her service.   Started with the avocado rolls.  They looked fantastic when they arrived.  But really they were just an egg roll paper stuffed full of avocado and void of any flavor other than grease.   I ordered the maui pork chop.  Again, it looked really great when it came out, but it was so tough that I had trouble cutting through it with the steak knife.  It came with roasted red potato's and steamed green beans.  The green beans were the best part.  My friend ordered the jambalaya and the waitress told him it was spicy.  He asked for it extra spicy.  It came with very little spice.  I tasted it and it was just totally underwhelming.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.   I really wouldn't bother coming back here.  There are many choices out there, and this just isn't worth wasting your hard earned cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=240

Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,1.0,6/18/2014,"Good thing this is all the way in Escondido. Now I don't have to worry about frequenting it. After a semi-long drive from Palm Springs, we decided this would be our late night dinner stop. We were hungry after an early grad party and after doing some damage at the outlet. Since it was my birthday I was able to choose between here and Cheesecake Factory. I stupidly chose BJ's since I was comparing it to my favorite Hazard Center location.  So like I said, it was my birthday. I walked in with a McFlurry since I wanted dessert before dinner and because when it's your birthday, you can do whatever you please! Duh! I basically greeted the hostess myself since I was immediately judged. I apologized for having it, but she pretended to understand after rolling her eyes at me. She then proceeded to walk us to a dirty ass booth. I wiped the booth down as she watched. When I finished wiping the other side, she grabbed a WET towel and wiped the side I was going to sit at and didn't tell me. I was in shorts so it surprised me and she laughed. It was not funny and I made sure she knew that. A few minutes later our waitress came. No smile, no welcome to BJ's, no anything. I can't even tell you her name since she didn't introduce herself. We ordered our food. I got a mini BJ's favorite, my friend got the California Burger, someone else got chicken wings, and I think my other friend got some kind of breaded chicken dinner. We also all got salads. The salads came out quickly and then it took over 25 minutes to get our COLD food. I mean COLD! My pizza was even a little doughy. I asked for no sausage on my pizza and still got it on there. Our waitress was never to be found for refills or to ask how we were doing. We ate our food since we were practically starving. Then the lady came out of no where and these were her words ""I'm sorry I'm not feeling well. I have a bad migraine. Seth will be closing you out"". Um what? Who the eff and Seth and who the hell are you?!?! Seth did come eventually and to only close us out. We ordered a birthday pizookie with the manager and didn't get it until we finished paying our bill. I mean seriously, the worst service and some of the worst food I have tasted.

I remember one time we waited for about 40 minutes just for a booth seat for three people. That was annoying. On the other hand, it can go really fast.  The food is pretty good, alright, and nothing special. I love their pizza and pasta, because their pizza is fluffy and thick and they serve a good portion of pasta. My favorite thing however is their pazookie, which is probably the best thing in the world. It's basically a giant, warm cookie in a plate with ice cream on top.

Alaok D.,"San Diego, CA",1,75,,2.0,2/5/2013,"I'm sad to say that my earlier 5 star rating has been lowered to two stars based on recent visits. Both were essentially the same problem, but I will relate what happened on my most recent visit, Saturday, Feb. 2. We called ahead for seating which is a great thing - when it works. We arrived at 5 PM, and were told it was to be a 20 minute wait even after calling in. WTF? We were seated 30 minutes later. OK, they blew it on that one. We had a very pleasant server, none of what ensued was her fault. My wife ordered pasta of some sort, I ordered a NY steak, my daughter and fiance shared a pizza. Three of us got salads. IT TOOK 30 FLIPPING MINUTES TO BRING THE DAMN SALADS. So we ate them, and the entrees came. Well, some of them did, my steak was MIA. The server was apologetic, she said the manager was aware of the problem. It took at least 15 minutes to get my steak, which tasted great. The other three at the table also enjoyed watching me eat it since they were mostly done with their dinners. My daughter and fiance shared a dessert, my wife got the complimentary one for her birthday. I didn't need one, I was still eating my entree.  When the server presented the check, we had been comped the dessert. The manager had failed to make an appearance at our table, so I asked to speak to her. She was indifferent to the problem, only saying that she ""had heard something about it"". I proceeded to tell her about the failure of the call ahead seating thing, the 30 minute wait for salads after ordering and the botched steak dinner, and the only reply she had was ""uh, we were busy"". She did eventually offer an apology and comped the botched steak dinner, but I don't think I should have had to unload on her to get this concession. I don't like having to do things like that.   A similar incident happened a couple of months earlier, this time a pizza my daughter and fiance ordered arrived well before the other entrees arrived. This same manager was about as interested, as contrasted to the manager that I referenced in my original review, he was great. The sad thing here is that we all love BJ's food, but the system can't seem to get the food out of the kitchen and to the table.  Just for the record, this is the first time in my lifetime of dining out that I have ever had to ask to speak to a manager, I am not a chronic complainer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=340

The ONLY drawback was that our baked potatoes tasted like they were two days old, and they were kind of blackened and burned on the outside.  I am a cook and I know an old baked potato when I taste one.  Yuck.  Guys: get some fresh potatoes\ and don't serve me something that's been cooked and reheated!  It was a shame that an old potato had to spoil what was an otherwise excellent meal.  We didn't complain, I guess we should have, but I never want to be one of those customers that runs the staff ragged with complaints.  Anyway, next time I will just order extra veggies!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=340
Miki L.,"Long Beach, CA",274,155,774,2.0,2/3/2011,"I've finally decided that BJ's is just a 2.5 star restaurant in Yelp terms, regardless if its San Diego, Temecula, Fullterton or the one I ate at yesterday for lunch -- in Escondido.  I definitely would never choose to come here on my own, however, it was per the request of a vendor that my assistant and I meet him for lunch, so we met him for lunch here. One positive about this restaurant chain is the reasonable lunch time specials! The service was very slow and our waitress after about 15 minutes came over to take our order. My assistant ordered her usual, Chicken Teriyaki, I ordered the Chicken Strips (my usual) and our vendor ordered the Club Sandwich; both of the latter dishes came with fries and the both of us requested the Wedge fries.  The food was delivered about 15 minutes later. The waitress who delivered the plates didn't know who ordered what, which is somewhat disappointing because I thought that was the basic rule of a waitress/waiter... to order and serve starting with the person on the left. Needless to say that in addition to this, the wedge cut fries were not on my vendor's plate, instead the thin cut fries were; he was super disappointed and said that when he had been to BJ's previously the same thing had occurred. The waitress came back with a plate of wedge cut fries for him and left us alone until the check came. The service left a lot to be desired.  When my assistant and I arrived back to work, we immediately noticed that both of us were dying of thirst. The only time I ever have this experience is when I have a lot of soy sauce and this had not been the case yesterday; the fries were the common denominator and we decided they were loaded with sodium... so be careful if you are sensitive to salt!!

Kathleen B.,"San Diego, CA",366,15,9,2.0,11/3/2013,"BJ's has really gone downhill these past few years. I used to be a regular, but it's just been bad news bears for too long.  I usually shy away from places that provide such large menus. I feel like there's no specialty item. The menu goes from Asian chicken wontons to bison burgers to pastas to pizzas (flatbread and deep dish) to Moroccan spiced salmon to fish and chips to giant baked potatoes and the list goes on and on....for about 20 pages. It's kind of overwhelming. My biggest complaint is that the water tastes like it came straight out of the sewage. On multiple occasions, I've had to order a flavored beverage to avoid the water. The ""gourmet mac and cheese"" used to be really good. It actually tasted gourmet, with thick stretchy cheese and a delightful sprinkling of bread crumbs. Tonight, it looked like soup at the bottom. It was supposed to have bacon crumbs on top, and what we got looked like one strip of bacon ripped into 5 pieces.  Also, when did Goldfish (the fish-shaped cheesy snacks) belong in mac and cheese? The last few times I've ordered the pasta, my boyfriend and I asked if we could split it. Twice, they've said yes; and twice they've said no. Consistency is key!!!! Sometimes the pasta is cooked al dente, other times it isn't. Sometimes they give two pieces of bread, sometimes it's one. Though minor offenses, I can only wonder what other things they're inconsistent with. They sure are consistent with water quality being poor!! The pizookies are always great, though. I'll give them that.  Also, the beer selection is great (as I hope it would be for calling itself a ""Brewhouse"").

This place was packed! Luckily, my cool girlfriend had the wonderful idea of calling ahead to get our names on the list. Our hour and a half wait turned into a half hour wait.  Since BJ's shares the parking lot with the North County mall, there's plenty of parking spots. We walked in and were amazed by how big the restaurant is inside. It's a nice restaurant combined with a sports bar.  Although we spent our wait in the mall, once we were seated we noticed that the wait staff was offering slices of pizza to the people waiting for a table. That was nice touch!  Our waiter wasn't too impressive but the majority of the staff seemed friendly.  I was amazed at the selection of beer on tap and decided to order their amber red beer. It was pretty good and went well with my pizza. I chose the BJ's Specialty Deep Dish Pizza. The pizza arrived hot and delicious with lots of toppings. I would definitely order it again!

Today, I must say, the BJ's in Escondido highly disappointed me. My friend and I were meeting up for a nice dinner and we got a waiter in the outside dining area who greeted us at our seat and proceeded to ask us if we wanted anything to drink (we ordered water) then continued by asking us if he could bring us out some eggrolls. He wasn't offering us the specials nor was he listing some appetizer favorites. He specifically mentioned eggrolls and only eggrolls out of their gigantic list of appetizers...was this because we were Asian Americans?? strike 1 We then ordered our pizza and when another lady comes out with our pizza, she puts it down then goes to get us some plates after. Is there a reason why you wanted to give us a plate with an enormous tomato sauce stain in the middle of it? Did this come from your fingers touch our food...or was it your mere lack of attention to detail, not even detail...that stain was huge. strike 2 Lastly, my friend's water cup was sitting on her table empty throughout our whole dinner with no mention from our waiter to come and fill it up for her. After we paid our bill, which I so awkwardly had to sign as he stood hovering over like he was in such a hurry even though there were tons of other empty tables, we sat for another 30 minutes talking and we finally had the waiter stop by asking if he could get us any drinks to go...to go??

My wife had ordered some kind of salad, at some point she mentioned to our waiter Justin that the menu stated that there were baby field greens in the salad but she found none only romaine, and the field greens are why she had chosen it. He looks at the salad and says there are field greens in it and she says no its all romaine. So he just turns and walks away??? later she asked for a chocolate pazookie he brought a chocolate chip pazookie she looks at him and says this is not a chocolate cookie it should be very dark brown almost black he looks again then walks away no words. He then comes by and grabs the wrong dessert and takes off no words, a few minutes later he shows up with the right dessert slaps it on the table and leaves no words again, a few minutes after that he brings our check slaps it down and zips off no words, and finally i put cash in the check  holder he picked it up quickly took off not a sound or even eye contact, he brought back my change and you guessed it slapped it down no words and split, he got a dollar tip.

Even after we asked for it to be packed to go, it still took another 10 minutes to get our food.  But in the end their great customer service saved the day.  Their manager comped our food that was to go, and only charged us for the salad and drinks that we had consumed.  We were pleasantly shocked as we had not complained or been upset, but really appreciated the gesture.  So not thrilled with the overly long wait for a meal, but very pleased with their response to our concerns!  And my pepperoni flatbread was delicious in the car on the way to our next stop!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=320

We had an ahi tuna salad and that was good.  Plus, we had a half and half pizookie- half red velvet and half chocolate chunk.  Those were both good.

When she did it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and then our salad never came. The pizza came out along with an entrée about 40 minutes into us sitting down.  I let the server know that the salad never came and asked for it to be removed but instead she brought it over well after our pizza has been served. When she did, I told her that I didn't want it and she said no problem she would take it off the bill and I thought it was done with. However, when we got the bill the salad was still on there and the server was nowhere to be found. Instead of trying to track her down for $4 we ended up paying it, but it was quite disappointing that she didn't just remove it from the bill as asked.  The food was so so.

Each time my family and I come in we ask for Paige in the bar area. She is always very personable, caring, and genuinely wants the guest to enjoy their time to relax.

I ordered blackened shrimp tacos and was brought shrimp and arugula tacos. Totally different. When I received the replacement, there were like two shrimps in the tacos. My sister in law ordered a sandwich with the dressing/sauce on the side. It didn't come on the side.  As far as taste goes, it was good. As far as service and attention to orders, it was awful.

The pizza was served to us room temperature so that was disappointing but we were running behind for a soccer game so I did not Day anything to the server.

It's not the best deep dish pizza in town, but it's good enough for me to crave it every once in awhile!! Tips: make sure you sign up for their rewards program--it's free, you get points for discounts, and you get emails about free Pizookie days among other deals. I also recently noticed they have a chalkboard outside with daily specials offered. The only one I recall off the top of my head is half off large deep dish Mondays.. UM, count me in!? They have a decent happy hour and I usually find a beer that I like when I'm here.  BJ's offers curbside delivery, take out, dine in, and bar seating. Personally I don't have a preference between bar and dine in seating, and I've had a good experience with take out as well.  Call me plain Jane, but one of my favorites here is the pepperoni 100 ways deep dish. They have julienned, whole slice, among other forms of pepperoni that comes out super crispy and delicious! Deep dish here always wins.  Do yourself a favor and make sure you order a Pizookie!? They have several options such as a trio sampler and several different flavors, some seasonal. I've tried several and personally I like to stick with chocolate chip because other flavors have been too sweet.

It's not deep dish, not by any stretch of the imagination. Did a build-your-own with sausage, pepperoni, olive, and garlic. The box it came in was a regular pizza box that wasn't nearly deep enough for a deep dish (first clue), the outside bottom of the box was covered in dried cheese, grease, and bits of dried food (second clue), and, even though we waited15 minutes for the pizza to come out, the box was cold as opposed to just-out-of-the-oven warm (third clue). Despite these red flags, we didn't open the box to review the contents before driving home -- which is totally on us -- or we would have discovered they gave us the wrong pizza -- olive, jalapeno, and tomato. Thirty dollars for a veggie pizza whose cheese had already turned hard and cold on the seven minute drive home (probably because it had been cold to begin with).

For two days straight we felt absolutely horrible and we unable to do anything because we were either puking or having explosive diarrhea every 5-10 minutes.

It was so heavily covered in their vinaigrette dressing it'll make your tongue raw. Tons of wonton strips and only 4 slices of the Ahi Tuna. It wasn't a lunch portion, it should have had way more than that.  Bust! My husband got their deep dish pizza, lunch portion. It was ok and it definitely didn't have any sauce on it, at all.

We came on a Thursday, which just happened to be 3.50 beer night (for their brew). How lucky! We ordered (lunch menu): -Angel Hair Toscana: I thought it tasted bland, but my friend enjoyed it. I liked the pine nuts in it, but other than that I felt like it was under seasoned sauce. -1/2 cobb sandwich with fries and salad: I liked the cobb sandwich a lot, although it was greasier than expected when holding the sandwich. I do recommend trying it though! It's a great deal with fries and a side salad! -BJ's Hefeweizen: I'm not a light beer fan really, but my friend said she liked it a lot. -BJ's double IPA: it was part of the 3.50 which was nice.. but I only got 12 ounces for that price instead of the regular size. In general, it was good, but nothing spectacular. I asked to sample the double ipa and either the stout or porter (I love both and I can't remember which) to decide between the two. I was a little annoyed by what the server brought.. both samples were in hot glasses so I basically tasted lukewarm beer and had to decide from that which I liked more.

After waiting a bit, our lovely server Jenavie, regrettably informed us that the chefs had made a mistake and made a whole pepperoni with tomato! She brought it out to us anyway so we would have something to eat in the meantime. She then offered my sister and I complimentary house salads, which were delicious by the way, and told us our originally ordered pizza would be out shortly.

Chris A.,"Nashville, TN",631,230,267,3.0,3/25/2014,"I often wonder why BJ's is so constantly packed when I struggle to find anything inherently awesome about this place. Maybe it's another one of those criminal anomalies like Guy Fieri's popularity. Better question: Why do I keep coming back? BJ's is a 'brewhouse', but zero beer is actually 'brewed' at each BJs. You'd have to be a 'brewery' to do that.  The beer is actually decent, but, like the food, doesn't really take any chances. With the dizzying array of menu options, one has to wonder about freezer drawers in the kitchen. But you accepted all that before you came thru the door. Decor is incredible. 'East- Coast-High-End-Hotel Lobby-meets Waldorf Astoria vibe. The urinals are actually pretty cool too. Kind of a waterfall-to-the-floor type engineering to reduce spatter. So there's always that. Service is hit and miss. I think of BJ's as TGIFriday's older wiser brother...without the ""Happy Joy Joy"" chants and the circus flare. About the same level of service and food quality. If you like dessert, checkout the baked beignet, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream.

Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",20,29,8,2.0,2/13/2012,"THE RESERVATION My friends and I had a reservation at 7 p.m. last Thursday night for 8 people.  I was the last one to arrive at 7:02, and the host handed me a buzzer for when our table was ready.  When I approached my friends, they were all confused as to why I was handed a buzzer because they were told that the table was in the process of being cleaned off and that we were going to be seated right away.  17 minutes later the buzzer went off, and we were seated.  So much for reservations! THE DRINKS They were sloooooooow with getting our drinks, and some of us just ordered water with lemon.  Well over 30 minutes after our reservation time, we finally got our waters without the lemon.  8 minutes later, our waitress brought out lemon slices for our water.   THE FOOD I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with blackened chicken, and when it got to the table, it was lukewarm.  The chicken breast was dry and overcooked, probably because it was a small thin piece of meat equivalent to 4 Chicken McNuggets at McDonalds.  The pasta did not have enough sauce, so it was lacking in flavor.  The dish was totally not worth $14+.  On top of my whack dish, I think our waitress forgot to offer us soup or salad for our entrees.  (After deciding on what I wanted to eat, I had given my menu to my friend who didn't have a menu, so I wasn't 100% sure if soup or salad came with the entrees, but I'm pretty sure it did.  Of course I didn't realize this until after we left!  Oh well...I didn't need the extra food anyways!) THE SERVICE I assign the service a double S...Slow and Sucky!  I didn't bother to complain because the manager was the one who seated us, and he didn't offer an apology...so why bother complaining about the rest of the dining experience?  He clearly didn't care and/or felt that ignoring the screw-up was best. THE COMPANY I always enjoy hanging out with my friends, so the dinner was worth it just to see all of them!  I'll give this place an extra star just because I enjoyed my friends' company. THE VERDICT I'll only be back if this is where my friends want to meet, but I will definitely bring my own bottled water and eat beforehand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=400

I didn't really want a garlic burger.  The wedge-cut fries were fine, but didn't taste very fresh.  I had the red velvet pizookie for dessert... best part of the meal by a lot.  The service was all right I suppose.  Everybody's food came out quickly except for my wife's.  For whatever reason, hers came out nearly 10 minutes after everybody else's... all she got was the broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl.  How hard is that?  Hollow out bread, pour soup in bread and serve!  Strange.  Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes and food quality.   Overall, it's not terrible, but it really isn't worth the hype either.  I'll come back, but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=400

Even the lighting in Carlsbad was better... It's dark and hard to read the menu at the escondido location.  I came back tonight to give it another try.  My pork chops came out and one piece was super tough and dry, the other piece was uncooked... And tough as well.  The waitress said she would bring a brand new plate of pork chops for me.... She brought a new plate and it was the same two pieces... Cooked longer, and tougher!!! The manager Jeremy came over, and was not apologetic or anything, and kind of brushed me off, like he didn't give a damn.. The waitress asked if I wanted a different selection. I got the scallops.  Ugh... It came out and was fishy and cold.  At this point, we've been here for 2 hours. I just wanted to eat and leave.  So I ate the fishy cold scallops and asked for the bill. Manager Jeremy didn't even come by to ask how my second meal or third meal was.  So upsetting.  The waitress and the second waiter handled this so much better.  My final note.

Not only was our favorite beer here not on tap, (they had already converted to some ""Committed IPA"") they did not have any bottled in the back either. With a secondary choice in hand, I diverted my go-to pasta choice and ordered the fish and chips. Horrible decision. It tasted smokey and burnt as if they had been using the same oil for all of 2015, and we are currently 1/2 way through January of 2016.

My visit to this location in Escondido didn't fit the bill.  The grilled chicken baked potato was severely undercooked. We asked for it to be replaced, which they did, but it took over 15 mins for us to flag down our server. I had to ask the hostess to find him and send him our way. By the time it came back the rest of our party had finished with their meals so that person rushed to eat the new potato, which was also undercooked, but at that point it wasn't worth sending it back. I needed a drink refill and the server failed to notice my empty glass at the end of the table and even after I asked for a refill the server came back twice without my drink. The location wasn't overly busy, so I wasn't sure why we had all the delays.  I tried the new BBQ slider and chicken breast and it was mediocre at best. The only saving grace was the pizookie, which would be nearly impossible to screw up. Maybe it was just an off day, or who knows.

The restaurant was understandably busy due to the lunch crowd; we waited 20 minutes to be seated. No problem -- we were cool with that. While waiting, however, I observed an elderly couple walk away from the greeter in disgust because they had been waiting for over an hour and they had never been called to be seated. Yikes! Not a good sign. After being seated, we placed our appetizer orders and, shortly thereafter, placed our lunch orders. The first error occured when they brought out our salads before the appetizer arrived. Very disappointing. Then, when I eagerly placed my fork into what should have been a caesar salad and brought the first bite to my mouth, my taste buds vehemently protested. I had been brought a honey-mustard dressed salad (second mistake). Ick! When the appetizer finally arrived (about 25 minutes after it was requested), the main entrees arrived shortly thereafter (third mistake). Ugghhh. Serious timing issues going on.  Our appetizer, the avacado egg rolls, were hands down the money for the afternoon. Delicious. Sublime! Had I known that my turkey club sandwich was gong to be mediocre, I think I would have just requested a second order of avacado egg rolls and ate them in its place. Seriously, people, the avacado egg rolls are the bomb.  The waitress was sweet and polite. However, BJ's has serious service issues right now. Perhaps it is because they are still a burgeoning new establishment. Besides the egg rolls, the food was just o.k.

We got there just before noon, and were seated right away. Our waiter Will, was great. He got our drinks out to us quickly and as usual the beer was fresh and tasty. I chose a PM Porter which is made at their brewery.  We ordered the chicken pot stickers which were very tasty. You get six pan-seared dumplings filled with chicken, green onions, Chinese yellow chives, ginger and garlic. It's served with a wonderful soy ginger sauce. For the main course I ordered grilled bbq chicken sliders. They were topped with crispy onion strings and a smoky BBQ sauce made with their red ale which is also tasty. The dish also includes lettuce, tomatoes and pickles that accompany the four sliders.  I recommend getting a side fries since it's only a dollar more and you get a healthy amount.   We also go spaghetti marinara which was flavorful. It says a lot when a place can make a simple dish well. The third dish we received was the Angus beef sliders and those always please. The patties are well done with grilled onions and ketchup and also include  tomatoes, lettuce and pickles on the side. The final dish we ordered was the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad.  It includes crisp, chopped lettuce with a tasty honey mustard dressing, topped with tenderloins of lightly breaded, deep fried chicken, toasted almonds, cucumber, hard boiled eggs, corn and tomatoes. I will say the place was packed by the time we left, so it's a good idea to get there early.

It felt like every employee hired was working during today's lunch hour.  Maybe that is how they are being weeded out.  Whatever the case, we had LOTS of attention from the waiter, food runners and the bus staff.  All empty plates and cups were removed right away.  Frankly, I enjoyed the attention because I don't think it will ever be that good again.   On the other hand, it took a long time to get our very simple lunch order - soup and salad for me, mini pizzas for the other ladies in the group, and drinks.  If they had a handful more of people from the floor working in the kitchen, we may have gotten our food quicker.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they are still working out the kinks, getting used to the menu, getting used to the kitchen flow and getting used to a busy lunch hour.

WTF BJ's.  As we left, I noticed the bar was half empty, for the first time.  Standing room only before.  Because of your greed, we will never step foot in your establishment and you lost people.  If you felt you were losing money, make your happy hour from 4 or 5 to 7, not 3 to 7.  But to gauge your patrons.  SHAME.ON.YOU.  Aren't you making enough money to allow people to come in for a few hours and enjoy their evenings?  Whoever told you to change your happy hour policy needs to be talked to.  I am just shaking my head as I write this.  You need to make it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=460

Robert H.,"Denver, CO",164,634,1936,4.0,4/14/2011,"Ever since my trip to Chicago I have yearned to find a local pizza place that can deliver the same quality on some level. Trip after trip I am disappointing with cardboard tasting greasy pizza. And then there was BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, who came to rescue me from this sad world of pizza. - Quality Ingredients - Happy Servers - Fast Service - Expansive Menu I have to admit the main reason BJ's sticks in my mind is the pizookie, BUT the pizza is fabulous as well. This visit, my wife and I did a brunch mashup where I ordered breakfast and she ordered lunch. This worked well enough because we usually share our plates. Our server was a little pushy, wanting us to order right away and asking insistently if we were ready right after we sat down and again two minutes later. Within 5 minutes she asked 5 times and it was a bit annoying. I just stopped answering her and let my wife do the talking until I had decided. I don't know about you, but  when I am done looking at the menu it's usually a good sign I have decided. Apparently they don't teach that in waitress school. My wife started with a fresh, creamy, vinegar salad to open up her pallet and moved right into the Crispy Fried Artichokes ($3.25) we ordered. These lightly breaded artichoke hearts were fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. They were delicious by themselves but the lemon garlic aioli dip they give you really adds an explosion of flavor. My wife ordered the Mediterranean Deep Dish Pizza ($10.95) that was fresh, delicious and fluffy dough. You just can't go wrong with the grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. It'll have you in a deep trance of digestion, forgetting about anyone else you are sitting with *tunnel vision*. I ordered the Classic Breakfast Sandwich ($6.95) that was noticeably inexpensive but very filling and flavorful. It TKO'd Denny's, that's for sure. This magical sandwich is a remixed ""moons over myhammy"" and comes with two scrambled eggs topped with cheddar cheese and your choice of Applewood smoked bacon, grilled ham or country sausage links on grilled sourdough bread. Served with seasoned country potatoes. *drool*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=460
Chuck G.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,3.0,3/18/2014,"When I go to BJs bar, I'm there to enjoy the alcoholic drinks, adult comradery, and watch some sports on the big screen. When the heck did management decide to allow children in the bar area??? Don't get me wrong, I love kids. I've raised a couple of my own. But a bar is NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN!!!  And this statement goes for both sides of the argument. On the adult side, we adults need to get away and be with adults and discuss, joke, and make adult comments that children should not be around to listen or see. On the children's side, they shouldn't be exposed to this kind of adult behavior and reinforcing drinking at an early age. They don't need this. There's already an under age drinking epidemic. Now that this is off my chest, I can comment on the food... It's good and happy hour specials make it better.  'Nuff said!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=460

During a different visit, came in with a party of 25, service was so slooooooooow.  From getting our drinks to the servers (2) taking our orders, it must have taking at leat 2.5 hours.  From the time the first lunch item was served, until the last person recieved their lunch item, must have been about 30 minutes (some people had finished their meals before the last entree arrived.  - strike two On our most recent visit, we sat in the bar and ordered a pizookie for dessert.  We waited what we thought was a long time, at least 15 minutes, maybe 20, no big deal (we love the pizookie, so no problem waiting here).  The next thing we see is what we thought was our server walking out the front door with her apron off, she must have been going home.  What the????  Finally another server approached us and asked us if we needed anything else.  When we inquired about our dessert, she was clearly embarrased because our previous server (servers rotate all the time here), never entered it into the kitchen.  - strike three Your out.  I am taking Bj's off of my list of go to places.  Just to many mistakes too many times.   By the way where are the managers??????  Yes, I see them.  They are walking around, talking with servers, doing stuff with the computer.  They are easy to recognize.  I know who they are, but never once have they ever approached my table and asked me how everything was.  I mean what the heck.  We have had food taking off  our bill on different occasions and never has a manager visited our table.   If you ask me, it's not a service issue, it's a management issue.  Bye Bye Bj's, it's been great while it lasted.  I've been dining here for the past, gosh, I don't know, maybe 10 years, ever since I lived in SD and the La Jolla restaurant opened.  I feel like I'm saying goodbye to an old friend.  I sure will miss you.  Try to keep your eye on the ball (guests).

Joe Q.,"San Diego, CA",80,364,161,3.0,2/21/2011,"The restaurant has a nice layout.  It's a sports bar that separates the dining area from the bar area, but the bar area is a lot more generous to its customers compared to other places.  It actually has about 5-6 booth like tables, so when you take advantage of that happy hour you don't gotta sit at the bar or some tiny high table.  The happy hour deals are great.  They offer deals on their flatbread pizzas, sliders, almost all appetizers, beer and cocktails.  That's a good enough deal to have a whole meal in the bar area.  The beers on tap may not be as many as Yardhouse, but there is a big selection. However, the food quality is mixed.  The chicken tenders are great.  Crispy outside, warm inside and an accompanying honey mustard sauce.  The spinach artichoke dip came with lots of broken chips.  It was hot, but not much flavor.  Sliders had dry meat and needed ketchup to get some moisture in there.  Flatbread pizza was a little oily.  I didn't eat the middle pieces because it was too oil soaked and soft. This is a good bar place, not really something I would want to have a sit down dinner.  There's a humongo TV right behind the bar, so it makes a great place to watch a game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=360

When we got the food it was on the borderline of warm to cold food.  My nephew took one bite from his mac and cheese and had a disgusted look on his face.  His mac and cheese was cold.  I was hungry but just started eating away but he didn't want to eat his food so I had to ask them to heat it up.  I thought it would take less than 5 minutes but no it didn't.  10-15 min later when i was all done with my food I asked them about it.  They then brought out one but there was another one I sent back to them.  They didn't want it to sit out.  My nephews just ended up sharing it because they took too long to give us the food.  It tasted like the mac and cheese from the box which it probably is.   Anyways they were nice about it and ended up giving the mac and cheese for free so one star for that.   Second star is for the pazookies.  We got the pazookie trio for the 3 of us so we each had one.  I thought it was delicious.  Brownie and ice cream together is delicious.

Kate G.,"Davenport, FL",111,305,123,1.0,5/14/2011,"1-star.  Let me explain why: Food: The food was probably some of the worst food I've ever eaten.  They have a large menu and none of it is good.  I had the flatbread pizza thinking that it was something that is hard to mess up, and it was just terrible.  I had a hard time eating any of it. We also ordered a brownie with dark chocolate ice cream.. it was terrible.  The brownie didn't taste good and the ice cream made me gag. Service: The service here was not good.  We were there for around 2 hours and had to wait a very long time to ask for refills and to get our meals in general.  It was incredibly annoying.  The waitress wasn't that friendly, either.  Our table was just another thing on her ""to-do"" list for the day.  She didn't treat us like you'd expect a good waitress to.  We were just an inconvenience for her. Atmosphere: The atmosphere is alright.  It's really just a bar with some tables.  It's a newer building, so it has that going for it.. and it's fairly clean.  I mean, it has to meet health codes, right?  But other than that, it was just really bland and nothing special at all.

Paula D.,"Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego, CA",258,421,58,1.0,4/19/2011,"This is a rare one star review from me.  Over the last few months we kept trying to go here and the wait was always incredibly long,. Last weekend we came in early and called in 30 minutes prior to arrival. They don't  take reservations.. We came in and waited around 15 minutes after the call in. That was reasonable. Sadly that was the best part of the evening. We sat outside and it was a warm night so we were surprised that so many others were waiting with many open tables in the patio.   This should have been a warning to our group. of 5 people.  We were seated and the hostess provided menus.  After a longish time we had the waitress take our order.  Then...we entered the twilight zone.  The appetizers took at least 30 minutes to arrive and the waitress plopped them down without plates, napkins or cutlery.   She was absent until we asked for the plates, cutlery and napkins from another server. The main dishes arrived really late and lukewarm.  My plate included dried out carrots that looked really old and tired.  Eyeeew.   It took so long that my normally shy daughter said, OMG, when are we getting our food?  At this point I am wondering why there is always a line at this place.   The patio had several empty tables and there were still people waiting outside.   Maybe they knew that that patio was not the place to be if you wanted good service.  It was like the Bermuda triangle of dining. The long lost waitress arrived after we had eaten the main dishes and sadly we ordered dessert.  Mostly because the teens wanted the Pizzokie.   That was tasty but we had to wonder in what state was this dish prepared.   California was right out because it took so long to arrive that it had to have been imported from some place far away. So hear the Pizzokie arrives we have dishes all over our table, no one has cleared the courses prior and I realized that the only way to make room was for me to do this by moving the appetizer and dinner dishes to another table.   The final insult was when we ordered a beverage that never arrived and yet it appeared on the bill.   It was removed but only after I gave the bill a close look and looked concerned.

Ryan C.,"Escondido, CA",27,19,,2.0,9/1/2013,"This place is a bit of a gamble lately.  I suspect it's a staffing problem, mostly focused on the management.  It's completely possible that there are other staffing problems (or particular individuals); however, based on the other reviews here on Yelp plus my own experiences I think the root cause is with the management team. In our most recent experience, my family was seated almost immediately.  I asked the hostess to change the closest TV to the only live sports event (NASCAR, in this case) since it was playing a replay of horse racing from earlier in the day.  The host was happy to accommodate, and mentioned that she would ask her manager to change the channel.  Our server got to us quickly, and we ordered an app and  drinks (including drinks from the bar)--they came out quickly as well, and the drinks had the touch of an excellent bartender.  It took about 5 minutes or so before our server got back to us (she was relatively busy), and we ordered our food.  I asked her to see about getting the closest TV changed, too--just in case the hostess dropped the ball and didn't pass the request on to the manager. Skipping forward over 30 minutes, and I'm still looking at a replay of horse racing from earlier in the day.  It's clearly not the worst of all crimes, but it's unlikely that both the hostess and the server failed to notify a manager.  All the tables near us changed over, too, so it's not like anyone was actively winning/losing money on these ponies. So what's the big deal about the TV, you say?  It probably wouldn't be a problem, except we still didn't have our food.  Another 15 minutes pass, and our server comes by to say that our food should be up any minute.  Something is wrong in the kitchen, I guess.  A few minutes later, a manager arrives and tells us that the ticket got lost somehow, and all our food is being remade and should be out immediately.  We understand these things can happen, so okay. First out is my food, and one kid's.  His is fine, mine clearly was sitting around for a while--the plate was hot, but the food was cold.  I sent mine back as more of the food showed up.  The kids' food was clearly hot and fresh; however, my wife's food had also been sitting around for a while--the chicken was cooled down but the celery was warmed up (heat lamp).  She opted to just eat rather than send it back, too.  Shortly after, the rest of the food arrived (minus mine, since it was going to take about 10 minutes to remake). Sometime, while my food was being remade, the TV in front of me changed to the NASCAR race.  So that was something, which was nice. When my food arrived, it was hot.  It wasn't the best, but I'd give it a passing grade: the kitchen was in a hurry to get it out and make sure it was hot.  They succeeded, but it wasn't impressive.  Maybe I was just bitter by then, but I try to keep my own bad attitude out of the ratings (where possible, of course!). So, lots of apologies from the server.  It wasn't her fault, and she was nearly in tears over everything.  I can't blame her.  It's her tip on the line, and if the leadership and kitchen can't get their acts together it's causing her to lose out on money.  I certainly wouldn't put up with that situation for long--there are other restaurants looking for motivated and qualified serving staff. At the end, a different manager stopped by and talked about the bill.  He comped us for ""about half"" of the bill.  It's appreciated that they recognized the screw-ups (well, I don't think the TV thing was ever acknowledged, but I didn't point it out, either), and that they want us to return, and really at that immediate moment about the only thing management can do is comp some of the bill.  Based on the other reviews for this location, I wonder how often they are screwing things up with others.  Even if I get a free meal every couple/few times I return, it won't convince me that I should come back very often.  Instead, I'd much prefer the leadership focus on the issues, get them resolved, and start to enjoy better profits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=540

Well not much has changed. The service is still really slow. It has got a little better, but not by much.  We went in for Sunday lunch happy hour. Not a fan of the happy hour. $1 off cocktails is not much of a deal. What gets me is the cocktails are mediocre at best. I felt cheated since the bartender was making super weak drinks. Now don't get me wrong, I don't need strong cocktails every outing. But Geez at least pour some liquor in. I ordered a Vodka Cranberry with Gray Goose, and I might have got 1oz of vodka. So I basically paid $7 for a glass of Cranberry juice.

However, we did order the avocado eggrolls, and they were phenomenal.   Food and Drinks: A  It could have been A+ if the ribs/steak dinner was more memorable. Ribs were a bit dry, and while steak was cooked fine, it just didn't have much flavor. The table agreed, that my home grilled steaks are much, much better.  The pizza, calzone, appetizers and burgers were great though. Wait Time: We went on 4/17/10, Saturday evening. We expected the worst due to all the negative reviews about waiting and service. I called ahead 30 mins, once we got there, we waited 20 mins. Which was fine, because we were told it would be an additional 30 mins once we arrived.  Wait time: not a big deal for us at all..and it was PACKED.   Just make sure you call ahead. Reservations are for 10+, else you can only use call ahead seating. Service: Service was interesting. Again, we expected good food yet horrid service and wait times. But the wait (as noted above...was just fine). And the service was terrific!  Holly was our waitress. She was very professional and seemed extremely experienced. We were floored when she said this was her first serving job. She was one of the best waitresses we've ever had (and we eat out quite often). She checked on us often. She was very sociable, great with our 2 kids and made us feel like our experience was important to her.  She noticed the little things...like an experienced waitress would. We could not have had a better wait service at this restaurant. I asked if we could ask for her by name next time, and she said yes. So...from now on, we will always try to be waited on by Holly. She's an extremely valuable asset to this restaurant. The rest of the wait staff were also very good. Not a single problem. All very courteous, professional, and seemingly eager to help and please. They helped make a very fun and memorable experience. Wait Time: A+.  Service: A+ One thing however...we could tell that the restaurant was new. It was kind of funny and we turned it into a drinking game. The servers seemed to get tables mixed up quite a bit. I think they may not have their table number system down quite yet (or maybe it just changes a lot).  We noticed during the time we were there, that 8 times (6 to us) servers weren't sure which table the food was supposed to go to. So, every time we noticed this happening, the table had to take a drink.  It was all in good fun though. We didn't have a bad experience. I think we did have to exchange one set of silverware because a fork wasn't washed properly....but it was nothing big. This was an exceptional experience of terrific food served by an awesome wait staff. We think that this will become one of our favorite restaurants and plan to visit quite often...and have Holly serve of us...of course! She's the best...ask for her by name. You will not regret it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=540

I was in the other day right before the dinner rush and the service was better than normal :) I've tried a few different dishes and they've all been great. Getting food for take-out is fast and easy as well. I just started their rewards program and they give you a free mini pizookie just for joining. They also offer you to add to your program to get suggestions on beers to go with your meals as well. One thing that I feel is a little pointless is their call ahead system. You can call ahead of time to put your name down, but they don't add you to the line until you arrive at the restaurant. There's really no difference in wait time if you call a head or not. Something they may want to consider changing. With their rewards program, if you get enough points you can use them towards making a reservation (which they normally don't offer).

Food came out cold and undercooked.  Personal pizzas were warm... The bison burger was med rare, even though med well was what requested. They completely left the slaw off the the bison burger plate, and onions were not taken off. To make matters worse, the women's restroom was filthy.  The floors were wet, two of the stalls had no toilet paper or seat covers and one of the other stalls had what looked like vomit on the seat and floor area.  Even the dessert was messed up. Ordered two pazookies, one which was a free one from an email coupon. Instead one came out and completely forgot about the second one... So the check comes and they had nicely not charged us for two of the messed up ideas, we give them our card, and 10 minutes later, they bring back a more expensive check, a different one with all the ideas on it, charging us for more than we had agreed to pay.

But even with the pizza they give you little to no toppings. If you want a meat topping on your pizza forget about it, there might be specks of meat if you are lucky. My friends rave about the beer here, but i really dont think any of the BJ beers are any good. Jeremiah red is NOT like red trolley despite what i have heard. Overall this is a good spot for groups because the restaurant is big. I ONLY come here in a group setting so something positive can be said about that.

B R.,"Austin, TX",0,39,19,1.0,6/20/2014,"I have been to BJs before (different locations) and love the restaurant. However, we had an awful experience at this particular location. The moment we sat down, the waitress was pushing us to sign up for the new BJ's iPhone app. We were not sure if she had incentives for doing so, but it sure felt that way. The waitress told us that we would receive $5 off our bill if we signed up so we went ahead and did so. When we were ready to pay the bill, she explained we only get $5 off if we pay on the mobile app and showed us an advertising that indicated you needed to pay via the phone. I looked at the ad and it said that a minimum of $20 needed to be spent to receive $5 off. We were splitting the bill and each bill was just under $20. So, I made a point of saying, I do not think that it will give me $5 off since it will be under $20. and indicated that I would prefer to just pay with my credit card and not worry about the $5 off. The waitress insisted I try paying via the app and said if it does not work, she will give me $5 back another way. So, I paid via the app and as I expected, no $5 off. I am finally getting to the worst part of the story. The waitress asked the manager what to do and the manager stopped by our table. She could have offered us $5 cash, a free desert, anything customer oriented. Instead she pulls out a coupon and says that she has ""left over fathers day coupons for $5 off our next visit that are still good"" and she handed me the coupon. I could not believe she even said that it was a left over fathers day coupon. And the coupon was about to expire in a week.

Kimberly R.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,19,,1.0,3/29/2010,"Let me start off by saying I really really LOVE BJ's pizza, it is absolutely yummy goodness to me. My experience at this restaurant was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had in my entire life. My party of 2 arrived at 11:45am, we were seated promptly and had our drink order taken right away.  What they brought us were drinks in 2 of the dirtiest glasses I had ever seen in a restaurant.  My glass was slimey and had dressing all over it.  My friend's glass had some big black slimey thing stuck to the outside of the glass and dressing on the INSIDE of the glass. We grabbed a random waiter to change our drinks. We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for our waitress to return to take our order.  I ordered half a sandwich with caesar salad and my friend got the fish tacos.  30 minutes later she finally brought my salad, in that timeframe though I had to ask random waiters for refills on our drinks since she never checked on us.  20 minutes after the salad she stops by to say oh your food will be right out and I'll get you some refills, 10 minutes later stopped random waiter to get a refill.  10 minutes later the food finally arrived.  5 minutes later waitress returned with refills that she told us she was going to bring 25 minutes ago.  Waitress disappears again for another 30 minutes before returning to bring the check. In the time, my friend waited for our food, there were 3 tables around us that came, ordered, ate, and left before we ever got our food!! So I know this wasn't related to the grand opening, the crowd or the lack of kitchen staff, everybody else was getting their food promptly. Not once did the waitress ever apologize for the dirty glasses, or slow service and of course we were charged for everything.  Most places when you point out a dirty glass don't charge you for their drink, we were charged full price for everything.  Instead of waiting 20 minutes to argue, we paid and left.

My daughter's chicken fingers had more breading than chicken and the breading was fried hard. She liked the thin-cut French fries. I had the spring Thai chicken salad, which was pretty good. It has a little too much spicy seasoning, but I could scrape some off. My husband enjoyed his grilled mahi-mahi over rice. He said the draft beer was almost as good as what he gets at Karl Strauss.

Literally the noodles was so hard ! So I politely asked the server to take it back. Another 15 minutes went by for my plate to come back. This time it was a completely different there was no Alfredo sauce at all and no garlic bread!!! I had to ask for a side of the sauce! I was extremely disappointed and will not be coming back to this location. I just don't understand how do you mess up pasta? The young male was great I felt bad for him. But the cooks are terrible.

What do you know, we show up at 12:40 and are told it will be a 40 minute wait. Awesome! My family with small children were forced to wait by the front door in the heat for a table. I asked the hostess again about reservations, since I thought it was ridiculous that they don't do them, and she said they do do reservations but you have to make them a day in advance or call early in the morning. I called them right when they opened! If they couldn't accommodate our large group, they should have said so.

They have a great selection of beer as well as cocktails since they are a full bar. The atmosphere is busy, yet warm, they keep it a bit dark inside. The hours are great, they are open very late, so if you can't decide where to go late night keep this place in mind. I have to recommend the pazzookie. It's a fresh baked cookie topped with ice cream. However you can order it as large as a pizza!! Hopefully to share, but I won't judge if you don't.

She said no problem but for 15 people I would have to ask the manager. She was gone for a while then came back to tell us that her manager was too busy to talk to us. We were ther having lunch for 1 1/2 hour. She never came over.  The hostess said it wouldn't be a problem and we even talked about where they would put us. I called in the next few days and the hostess said no problem she would ask the manager. Then i was told the manager was too busy to talk to me but she said they couldn't do the party. The excuse was they might be booked or maybe there is a graduation or something that day. They didn't really know why the manager said no. Then I called corporate headquarters and got customer service. They took down my complaint and said they would call and fing out what was going in. Guess what? When they called back 10 minutes later the said the mamgers were all in a meeting and too busy to talk with her. She would call me back. That was 3 days ago and noone has called back.

I think the problem with that location is the ditzy morons they hired as hostesses and waitresses don't care if the place makes money, builds customer loyalty, or even stays in business.  daddy's paying all their bills, right? it's too bad, because their food is really good - but the service is so bad it's rarely worth the headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=480

I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza yet theirs is pretty legit.  When they bring it out it looks super small but man that stuff expands.  I've had a couple of their pizza's and they all were pretty good.  The last one we tried was the great white (I think that was the name..) It was definitely a different spin on pizza and was very flavorful. I've had the Sante Fe egg roll appetizer which isn't too bad, it definitely has a lot in the appetizer. I was disappointed when they brought out the french fries because they were pretty cold. If you get dessert there you have to get the pizookie!  It is do die for! The other day when I went I got the brownie and it came with a monstrosity of ice cream and whipped cream on top.  When I got to the brownie it was so damn sweet I could only eat 2 bites.  I wouldn't recommend the brownie unless you're down to go into sugar shock. I haven't tried to many of their beers so I wouldn't really know how to rate them.  When I went here on a date though, the guy ordered us the Hef brew....

Wow, I feel like I am 10 years old and this from a BAR MANAGER?!?! The food was cold and not good. The prices were high for happy hour and the bar tender was upset because we moved to a table from the bar and had the ticket transferred in stead of cashing out with her.

Michelle H.,"San Diego, CA",157,628,1316,2.0,8/22/2010,"Ok, so let me put this out there. I LOVE BJ's. Adore it. Read my reviews of the other BJ's.. I think BJ's is the bomb. All of them, except this one. I was only excited about this location being here because it was next to the mall and it was slightly closer than the La Jolla one. It has a full bar, and tons of taps, but that's another story here as well. The place is extremely busy. There's always a line except on a Sunday morning at around 11.. which will be the only time you'll probably see me here, unless I'm meeting my friend from San Marcos here since it's a half-way point.  Busy means standing around waiting, while having to dodge people who are trying to swing through the revolving door. Busy means all of the inexperienced, young staff are busy being inattentive because there's too many things going on at once, or busy having some small talk with one another. Busy means your food won't get out to you for at least 20 minutes (which has been a general occurrence the past 3+ times I've been here with some friends.. not a large group, mind you). Seriously, if you sit there and count the ratio of waiters/waitresses to other customers that walk past you, it'd probably be a staggering 9:10. With so many people working at the same time, you'd think BJ's would take at least SOME time to weed out the incapable ones. === Now, this part of the review only applies to the last time I went here (this past Thursday night, around 9pm): We called ahead, so we waited about 5 minutes to get seated. The buzzer thing goes off, and we give it to the girls at the front. They stand there and push buttons and don't say anything to us for a minute or two so we stand there awkwardly staring at them like... O.o huh. Then finally another girl bursts out and asks us ""Are you Jason??"" [The boyfriend's name], I said yes, she spends a few moments ending the wonderful conversation she was having with the other girl at the desk, then looks back at us and tells us to follow her. From that odd point on, I told my boyfriend I had a feeling service was going to be poop tonight. We get seated, with what we wanted to order already in mind. 5 minutes goes by, no one comes to the table. I check the time and it's 9:24. I'm looking at every single waiter/waitress as they walk by, and none of them even glance at us. 10 more minutes go by. A jolly woman approaches and she's friendly and prompt. She tells us that Anthony (or something like that) is actually our server, but he's ""busy at the moment"" and she'll be taking our order. Cool. She gets us our beers (which, for some reason, that night tasted horribly too sweet and thick to be considered a decent heff or stout.. what happened?!?) and our plates since we ordered nachos to share. She comes back in 5 minutes to get the rest of our order, when in fact she didn't give us enough time tell her that we were only sharing nachos and a pizookie. We tell her we just want a pizookie afterwards, and I WATCH HER! I watch her walk to the end of the aisle and tell this guy our order and I stare straight at him as he glances back at me at the table.  We wait about 20 minutes for the nachos, as expected.. because putting chips and chili and cheese in the oven takes as long as pizza does to cook, right? All the while, I'm staring at the dude that's supposed to be our server each and every time he walks to the table in front of us, next to us, AND behind us to check on them and bring them their food. No acknowledgement, whatsoever. Nada. As far as I know, he doesn't even realize we exist. So, long story short, I bet my boyfriend we wouldn't be getting the pizookie we ordered, and we didn't. The dude said 4 things total to us on our visit: ""your nachos will be right out"", ""did you want another beer?"", ""did you want one?"", ""here you go guys"". Every time I've been to BJ's, I've gotten the check in a black folder. This dude just decided to fold it and put it on our table. Come onnnnnnnn. He never even introduced himself, he never asked how our food was, he never even LOOKED at us, which would have been okay, except that he was pretty accommodating to ALL of the tables around us but decided we weren't worth it or some crap. If he had actually gotten our pizookie and acted like a normal server, he would have gotten the normal 18% tip we give everyone, instead of the 10% I still feel he didn't deserve. If you're going to act like a little pansy, you're going to get a little pansy tip. My man, you're a self-fulfilling prophecy if you assumed we were crappy tippers! To the manager of this BJ's, your customers would appreciate some higher quality staff. I love BJ's, but I'd rather go to La Jolla and deal with the wait there than the wait here plus the horrible service.

Jeremy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,9,1,1.0,6/7/2010,"I love BJ's and I've had a lot of BJ's all over SoCal -- I had BJ's in college, BJ's by the beach, BJ's that I've paid for, BJ's that friends have paid for, BJ's with girls, BJs with guys, sometimes both together, and I never expected that BJ's could be bad until my experience last night. Now that I've gotten your attention with my intentionally suggestive intro, I hope you'll continue reading about what an awful restaurant this Escondido location really is! As much as I love BJ's (restaurants) I will NEVER EVER go back here and I encourage anyone else who likes BJ's (restaurants) to avoid it as well, because it has now associated a horrible experience with something I usually enjoy. Call Ahead Reservations = Not really We called in like 10 minutes ahead and when we got there the name wasn't on the list. We were told that we probably were on the list from like the take out desk or something and that we got there so quickly it hadn't been transferred to the main one. Sounds like a crack system they've got! But OK, not going to let that ruin the night, kind of a minor inconvenience at most. Less than 30 Minute wait = 40 minute wait Again, kind of a minor thing 10 minutes... whatever. But maybe say ""30 minute wait"" not ""less than 30 minute wait"" (I think there was a ""definitely"" in there, but I'm not gonna quote it because I'm only 90% sure) -- it made me feel like they were trying to trick us into not leaving for another restaurant. Indoor Seating = Table right by the door that is drafty and freezing and has cigarette smoke wafting in from the waiting area outside. At this point we weren't really upset by any of the little things, plus we were hungry, so we just stuck with it. When we mentioned it in passing, we weren't offered another table (although we didn't ask directly) so we figured better to stay here and just get some food soon than to wait for another table. 45 minutes later... No food. We had a server switch half-way through our wait so maybe that had something to do with the delay, but seriously... get it together, EVERY restaurant does server switches when people have to go on break or whatever, and they seem to manage just fine. Also, with the second server, the refills slowed down significantly. When the food did arrive (3 pizzas and 1 calzone) the pizzas were warm at best, and the calzone was wrong. You should not be able to touch a pizza pan that recently came out of the oven, but you could hold this thing with your bare hands. And the calzone wasn't just wrong... the only thing RIGHT about it was that it was a calzone. Not a single ingredient was right (including the cheese!). Can we talk to a manager? - Only if you ask twice and wait 10 minutes Yes, we finally broke down and had to say something, but of course our server couldn't be found. So we walked up to the host stand and asked that a manager come over... 10 minutes later our server came over and we explained the extent of the screw up and she said she'd go get it fixed (meanwhile, it was my calzone, so I was starving... it had been almost an hour and a half since we got there). No mention of the manager... So we had to ask AGAIN. Finally, the guy shows up.  What can he do? He says all the right things, apologizes, etc. etc. He's going to take an item off the bill or something... offers a free pizookie (which we declined because I had to drive to LA after this and everything had already taken much longer than expected). Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... So I get the 2nd calzone, and with great fanfare (and both our server and the manager present) I cut into it to inspect... Chicken and black olives, looks good! YAY I can finally eat!  Manager and server leave, and I eat alone as the rest of my party (who had already finished their food) waits for me. About 3 bites in I find a meatball. I kind of laugh it off... of course, one stray meatball gets in there, it couldn't be perfect, not tonight, hahaha. THEN I take another bite and I realize it is FULL of meatballs. WTF?? Like the middle of the calzone is Chicken and Olives, but the edges are filled with meatballs and green peppers!  This is awful, it's not what I want to eat, and I put it down. We asked to see the manager again, told him we weren't paying for anything and we were leaving. I would just get Carl's Jr. or something form the road. Icing on the cake - The parking lot is flooded! We walk out and the street is a river of water from some pipe that broke in the parking lot... There was about an inch of water I had to cross in flip-flops, and it just made for the perfect ending of a perfect night.  Admittedly, THIS was probably not BJ's fault. The only thing that got me through the aforementioned drive to LA after dinner without being just completely irate was the fantasy that my scathing review would encourage others who had bad experiences to also write reviews and one day soon that BJs would be closed down for something better.

Besides the fact that I have frequented BJ's al bet the place, the food most of the time comes out wrong or the service is really slow, but my kid likes the pizookie so we go there for him. Anyway, this waitress ended up literally telling me to go F myself and called me a liar after I called her out for messing something up that was blatant.

Wendy S.,"San Diego, CA",65,2,,1.0,6/7/2010,"Call ahead service? Ha! So they say, but they forgot to put us on the list so we got to wait the full regular 40 minute wait on a Sunday evening. But then we were seated and greeted promptly by our waiter who took our drink orders, returned with drinks, and took our meal orders. He even got in a drink refill as we waited for our pizzas and a calzone. (There were four of us, including our son who was going to be driving up to LA that night still). When the waiter went on break, our new waitress refilled our drinks, then we didn't see her until after our order was brought to us by someone else after waiting for our food to arrive. It had taken almost 45 minutes for our food to be served. The pizzas were cold and the calzone was wrong - we think it was someone else's order it was so wrong. The waitress checked the order, took the calzone back to the kitchen and never returned to let us know what was going on - no apologies, no information on how long it might take, nothing! My husband had to go to the hostess stand to ask to see a manager because our waitress seemed to have disappeared. No manager appeared for 10 minutes and only after the waitress magically appeared again and we asked to please find the manager for us. The manager apologized all over himself and wanted to make sure that we would ""leave happy."" About 10 minutes later the new calzone came out (the rest of us were finished eating) and my son cut into. All looked fine...until the waitress left and at about the third bite, his chicken, olive and mozzarella cheese calzone was actually that , plus meatballs and bell peppers! That was it! He still had to get to LA, and wasn't going to wait for another calzone to be made. He decided to forget it and stop off at Carl's Jr. and get something he knew he would eat and get to LA at a somewhat decent hour. He was very disappointed- BJ's had been his choice because other locations in Orange County and San Jose have always been good. Total time for our dining experience: over 2 hrs on a Sunday evening with a poor outcome.

The staff doesn't care what time they quote the pickup time on their website. Be prepared to wait 15+ minutes extra. I have even had to wait upwards of 45 minutes and I was the only car in the Curbside To Go area. After all the waiting, you would think that my order would be correct- No, NEVER! I have even called the manager to complain and  they blame their staff and claim they have training issues. The last time I spoke with the Manager, she offered to send me some coupons if I came back- No they never arrived. Bad management usually leads to under performing staff. Against my better judgment, I ordered Curbside To Go again tonight. It was late (9:45 PM), but the BJ's website accepted my order. I show up to BJ's and no one picks up the Curbside phone. The staff is hanging out in front of BJ's and no one cares that there is a customer-- a paying customer waiting to pay. I finally get someone to pickup the regular phone and when I complain and ask to speak to a manager, she hangs up on me. I call back and speak to the manager and he tells me Curbside To Go closes at  9 pm for staff safety-- the same staff that is hanging out outside BJ's. He did offer to walk my order accompanied by his staff when I stated that I could not walk up the ramp due to a disability, but by then I was thoroughly disgusted. I told them to keep my order- I will NEVER visit them again. BTW- I did eat inside once and the service was HORRIBLE and they forgot the chicken on my chicken cesar salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=500
Andrew N.,"Escondido, CA",1101,437,76,3.0,8/5/2010,"First off, I'm a fan of BJ's brewhouse. I have been since I was in college since there was one pretty close. They have a good selection of house beers and they sell them by the pitcher. My favorite has always been the Tatonkin. Its been awhile since I've been to a Bj's. We came here for the part for two deal. Two salads, medium specialty pizza, and a pazookie for 20 dollars is great. Their medium pizza are already 20 bucks so you're pretty much getting everything else for free. Our wait wasn't too long, but they did have a line of poeple and pretty much all the tables were full. Someone else commented on bad service and I can see why. Our service actually started off pretty good, but as the night went out, our server took longer and longer to come back. Although she was not rude, she apologized and always filled our drinks when she did come back. They might be short of staff or running thin for for a Thursday night. I usually only get the buffalo chicken pizza or nachos and a pitcher of beer. Usually keeps us set for our visit there. Give their beers a try. I didnt give them 4 stars since the service wasnt super great, but the food is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=500

I've ordered so many different items off their menu and, other than that pasta I discovered on my last visit, nothing was really good or stood out to me.

John B.,"Escondido, CA",9,39,4,3.0,7/30/2010,"Eh, don't bash this place too much. I'll admit, I'm rating this place as average because of the wait. If you don't call in or just screw around you'll have to wait at least half an hour.  Redeeming qualities? Sure, they give you pizza while waiting, which is some of the best I've had, ever. Aside from that, what you get when you order is alright, there's just a lot of it. Which is kinda weird. I like quality over quantity. Another thing, which some people I know will get annoyed at, is how noisy it is inside. It's trying to be a restaurant/ bar hybrid, but the two sides only meet halfway. The bar is noisy, but there are big TVs. The restaurant is comfy, but it's loud because of the bar and crowded.  Kind of a hit and miss here, might be good for a one time thing but it's not a practical choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=580
P L.,"San Diego, CA",0,33,,1.0,12/10/2013,"The only item that was great was the Double IPA.  I'd buy it by the case.  We are repeat customers at this location and would have recommended it in the past.  Now, I'm quite sure we'll never go back. We had a ""new"" server, at least that's what he repeated to everyone. He first delivered the beer and an iced tea.  Never once did he offer sweetener for the iced tea and there was never an offer for a refill during the hour that we were sitting there. He then managed to deliver a wrong item to us.  He said we would keep it if we wanted to. The item was the Ahi salad.  The salad was wilting/rotting and the Ahi that was served was inedible.  It was a health hazard and should have never left the kitchen. We asked the waiter to take it back and dispose of it.  We also had the Ahi Poke.  The Ahi was better than that served on the salad, but not top quality to be served raw.  With some dressing it was edible.  The thin cut fries and calamari were fine, but very greasy.  Both should be served on a paper doily to sop up some of the oil. Well, lunch was a wasted $33.91. BTW-  We were sitting across from Barry M who also had the same newbie server and same terrible experience that we had .  See his 1 STAR review from 12/10/2013",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=580

After being seated waited 10 minutes to be approached. We were ready to order drinks and our meals. Took another 15 minutes to get our drinks- so now we've been here 25 minutes. Bring our food and 1 order was wrong. Asked to have a to go order when we ordered dinner. Waitress said she'd put it in when we were eating. Came by to check on us once we were finished. Forgot to put in the order. TERRIBLE SERVICE! Employees standing around chatting. You can tell this location is mismanaged. This was our regular spot to come (once a week). No more.

Brad B.,"Poway, CA",8,117,15,1.0,10/7/2013,My family and I come here a lot.  Typically we are here once a week...Escondido has limited choices. Service is intermittent. There are good servers and not so good servers. Tonight was exceptionally bad. It took ten minutes to be greeted after sitting down and  20 to get our drinks. The restaurant could not have been more than 50 percent occupied. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. My wife's fish came out blackened when she ordered grilled. Overall it took an hour and 15 minutes to get through our meal of mediocre food to the tune of $100+. We are premier rewards members in excess of 1000 pts (meaning we have spent over $1000 since joining the rewards program). Oh and when my daughter asked for parmesan cheese to go with her adult plate of pasta she was given a dozen packets like you would get from a pizza delivery person. Really? This place is going down-hill fast. I think I will try the new Plan 9 Alehouse on Grand next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=580
Brian G.,"Poway, CA",0,35,2,1.0,5/25/2013,This place has changed and the poor reviews are more then warranted. Went there for daughters 9th birthday. sEating was a reasonable 15-25 minutes. Initial server attention was timely and polite. It went down hill fast from there. It took at least 40 minutes for dinner to arrive when it did they served 3 out of the 4 of us and then the 4th the birthday girl got to wait another 10 minutes. Desert was the same story. They brought one ice cream and not the other 2. You can't wait with ice cream.  We had asked them to please lite a candle in my daughters ice cream. The wait was so long she went to the lady's room. Server came by and said I will leave this here and you can light it. she did remember when we were had through desert to ask if we needed it lit. We decline not to upset my daughter. The food was mediocre at best. how to you screw up angel hair pasta? It tasted and looked like it was sitting the entire forty minutes I we waited under a heat lamp then re microwaved. it was dry and stuck together. I am the person the always over tips. I have never complained to a server in my life but simply left a one dollar tip. We had been there about a year ago and all was different.

Nina F.,"San Diego, CA",343,20,14,3.0,2/13/2014,"I've been to BJs 3 times in my life & 2 of those times were at this location. My first time I came to celebrate a good friend's birthday. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the Ahi Poke which was really good. I took bites of the stuffed mushrooms, the jalapeño burger & a few others. Everything was delish! I came here as our 2nd choice restaurant for a quick late dinner after shopping at North County Fair (there was a 40 minute wait at Cheesecake Factory). This time I ordered the Brewhouse Burger with bacon, cheese & avocado plus the Crispy Calamari as an appetizer. I don't know why I ordered such basic stuff there when I can get that anywhere but that's what I craved; a nice juicy burger. Calamari came out, eh, it was ok, not the greatest but not the best either. Burger came out a minute later & that was ok too. Thin slices of avocado; not sure if/how much I was charged for that but I was expecting thicker chunks (I love avocado!). Beef wasn't that juicy & the seasoned fries that came with my meal were dry & lacked flavor. They tasted like they were fried earlier that day & then been re-fried to be warmed up. Not cool. McDonald's has fresher fries & burgers which is sad. I took a bite of my boyfriend's roast beef dip & the au jus was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall, dinner was alright. I think out server was Chris (I think that's his name) & he was really nice. He kept checking in & filling up out drinks (I hate when I have to ask for my water to be filled because servers don't check up on customers).  With all that said, I wish I did go to The Cheesecake Factory but I'm pretty sure I'll be back at BJ's again for another bday or something. I can't expect too much for the prices, right?

Sarah L.,"San Marcos, CA",120,62,89,1.0,4/10/2011,"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION.  I have given them so many chances to improve, and nothing has gotten better. (This review is in regards to their services, not their food.)  I have gone about five times, and only two of those times were acceptable.  All of my bad experiences happened at nighttime.   First off, the wait is ridiculous.  Their table turnover sucks, because they put too many seats and they dont have enough servers.  Secondly, their servers are a hit or miss.  They are either very friendly and eager to help you, or very indifferent and seem to care less. Many different servers come to bring food and drinks, and they forget things like forks and plates.  You have to work so hard to get their attention just for a fork to start eating. Last night I went with a group of four, and their extremely bad service drew the line.  Our server was nice, but it seemed he was too busy for us.  But when he wasn't busy, he would stare at us and zip right past  us.  It took about three tries of waving him down for him to take our order. When the food came out, a couple of different servers took out each entree at different intervals of time, making me hungry because mine was last. At the end, he overcharged us for my pasta, and it took a total of 20 minutes for him just to change it. During this time of supposedly ""waiting for his manager to approve"" his mistake, he ignored us and waited on others, instead of refilling our root beer or giving us boxes, which took another three attempts at getting his attention.  After he finally came back with the revised check, he brought back a small to go bowl of tomato bisque, as an apology....-__-.  A PITY BISQUE??? No thanks. This location has been opened for a while, and I thought this was enough time to get their act together. I will now drive out of my way to the other location next time I crave a pizookie.    I think I am overcritical because I am a server, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=580

Nancy A.,"Poway, CA",7,12,,1.0,6/9/2010,"This was our first time to try this restaurant.  Our daughter's graduated from MS that day and we had a party of approx. 25 people.  I called a day ahead to let them know we were coming, was informed that there were no reservations available, but was advised to call the next day   so at 11am I called to tell them we would be there at 12:30 and our name was added.  Upon arriiving, I greeted the Host, who checked my name off and received my pager, was told the wait would be approx. 1/2 hr.  Great! After waiting an hour, the head Hostess came to me to tell me that she could sit us pretty soon, but would it be okay if we were at 2 tables - adults at 1, kids at the next.  No problem. We were finally seated!   A waiter(ress) arrived at each of our tables, took our drink orders, which arrived after waiting about 15 minutes with alot of confusion as to who got what.  But, none the less, we got our drinks.  We then ordered, kid table and adults.  I asked if we could put each of our kids on the parents tabs-to avoid confusion at the end-and was told that No, they could not do that, the system didn't work that way!  I was totally confused.  But, said Oh well, we would figure it out later.   The kids food arrived in a timely matter, the adults however  did not. After an hour of waiting, it was questioned to our waitress, what the hold up was and she informed us that she had just checked and that it would be out very soon.  Well-it wasn't, and she was not very pleasant to deal with.  We then spoke with the Manager, who explained to us that there was a ""situation"" that went on, but to be assured, that all is good now and we should be receiving our food quickly.  So, finally our meals started to arrive, at first a few salads came out, (which were not for us, but eventually they got it right), then the meals came out - ever so slowly!!!!!  We finally all had our meals- which were not worth waiting for!.  We questioned the head Hostess again about why such poor service and she had the nerve to say to us - ""well, what do you want me to do for you?  a song and dance!.  WOW!  I was shocked at such terrible customer service.  So, after complaining again, she then offered to me to put the kids on the appropriate adult's tab - which I had to decipher and give back to her.  Oh, almost forgot, before we even got our meals the waitress had the nerve to give all of us our bill!  I have never received the bill before the meal - that was a first!   So after waiting for her to change all of our bills - we had 5 families total - we waited another 20 minutes, she comes back all apologetic and announces that she has taken 25% off each of our tabs and also subtracted a meal for a few of us.   I have never experienced such poor poor customer service and will not be going back to this restaurant - ever!!!

I probably should have ordered the deep dish pizza, but I went on a diet and ordered the balsamic chicken dinner which sounded good on the menu.. it was terrible! The two chicken breasts were tiny - about a quarter inch at the thickest point and about four inches long...about three or four tiny bites each. Just tiny and because they grill them and overcooked them they were dry and tough to cut. Just pathetic. It comes with a dry scoop of mashed potatoes and mixed vegies. I would have sent it back but because I'd already complained about the beer I didn't want to ruin the dinner for my family.

Helen K.,"Fullerton, CA",8,60,,1.0,8/24/2010,"Wow, it's interesting to see that I'm not the only one that had such a horrible experience.  Bear with me and hear my tale... We've tried to go once before and the wait was way too long for us to dine here.  I've gone to BJ's out in Brea and Culver City, so I know it's pretty popular.  This one is Escondido is outrageous, it's always busy and parking is horrible. So, we went a few weeks ago at about 4:30pm, figuring a wait shouldn't exist or be that bad and even called ahead.  We had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated although it wasn't packed.  It's freezing inside, why is it always freezing in these places?  We ordered our drinks, salad (3 total), and main course. Our drinks arrive, ok.   One salad arrives.  We inform them we ordered three.  A bit over five minutes later a second salad arrives, we inform them we ordered three total.  The server that brought the second salad doesn't seem to be a total idiot and gets us the last salad within a few minutes. So then two main dishes come out, they announce the scampi pasta (my order) and put it in front of me and it's clearly some kind of rice dish, kung pao? sauteed vegetables?  I don't know.  All I know is that it's clearly not angel hair pasta.  Does the server not know what angel hair pasta looks like? Hmmm...  No refill on drinks offered.  They finally get my order and the pizza that was ordered comes out.  She tries to serve it but it doesn't seem like the kitchen sliced it.  She's struggling to slice and serve the pizza with the pie server thing.  Poor thing.  My father-in-law ordered the fish and chips, asking for the thin fries and gets the wedge cut. So we're finishing up our meals and my father-in-law orders a cup of coffee.  ""Sure"" she says.  Several minutes later, no coffee.  It's been some time since our server has checked on us.  No refills and no coffee... we are in no mans land, although we are fairly certain we are still visible.  Our server comes near our table and we flag her down.  We need a couple of boxes and we still haven't gotten the coffee yet.  I see her go to get boxes but they seem to be out at the serving station near us and she just ignores the fact that we seemed to ask for the boxes.  She seems to remember about the coffee and brings it but before it even leaves her serving tray, I notice the clear red lipstick sitting on the rim of the cup, looking like someone had just taken a nice sip after applying her (or his, not going to judge here) lipstick.  She apologizes profusely and leaves to get another cup.  Another cup of coffee arrives, she remembers she was supposed to get us boxes (which another server has refilled at the station) and we get the check.  I saw my father-in-law get out a credit card and think twice.  He took out some cash and we get out of there. There's a porter beer they serve there that we enjoy a lot, so we will likely go back to BJ's, just not the Escondido location.  I'm not sure if the staff is still green or what but the service was incredibly bad.  My father-in-law was pissed (he's the silent, I'm-going-to-kill-you-one-day kind of guy).  As we would only go there with them I seriously doubt we'll ever be there again. I gave the place, this particular location, one star.  It was impressive how bad the service was and it wasn't even that busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=620

I stopped in here on Saturday after visiting the Wild Animal Park, and it was pretty slow.  Of course it was 4:00 in the afternoon, so I wasn't too surprised.  That said, the service was excellent!  I know lots of people have complained about the service, and maybe we were just lucky, but I was impressed by the attention and care shown to us.  We were there with a couple small children, and they brought us crayons, oyster crackers, goldfish crackers, and kids cups, without barely a word.  Very thoughtful! As none of us were very hungry, we didn't order entrees or appetizers, but were intrigued by the variety of soups they offered.  So one of our party asked if there was a soup/salad buffet on the menu, and our server immediately said, ""Well, there is, but it's a lunch special, and we don't offer those on the weekends... but I can make it happen for you.""  So awesome! So yeah, we all had soup and salad.  The house salad was a house salad... nothing special.  The dressing was good, the lettuce crisp... what else do you want?  I ordered the Cherry soda, and was very happy with it.  Plus free refills!  Excellent!  After one glass of the Black Cherry, though, I wanted to try the Orange Cream.  It was just okay, the Cherry was definitely better, IMO... The soups, on the other hand... Amazing!  The clam chowder was one of the best clam chowders I've ever had!  Thick, Rich, Clammy!  Yumm!!!  The tortilla soup was also excellent!  Very good flavors, nice chunks of chicken, I wanted to just put it in a glass and drink it down.  Plus I'm a sucker for fresh avocado, which was part of the presentation of the tortilla soup.  EXCELLENT! As we finished up, I started getting past the ""full"" feeling, and belatedly asked our waiter if he could get me another bowl of clam chowder (it was THAT good), and he apologized, saying that he had just closed our ticket and our bill, and there was no way for him to ring it in.  I told him never mind, that it was okay, but he told me to hold on a minute.  Sure enough, a couple minutes later, he brought me more!  Awesome!  He got an extra big tip for that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=600

He went to all the other tables (there were 3 others) but never came to ours.  So I went up the the bar to get water and my friend got her refill at the bar, also.  When the waiter came back out, the Bartender told him that we had wanted water and that he did not bring us any.  You would think he would have come over to apologize but he didn't.  We actually had filled out the credit card slips and they sat on our table for an hour. He only came back at closing to pick them up.  I was kinda appalled.  I would have ordered another drink and probably would have wanted to come back in the future.  But this experience has made me want to go other places.  Management really needs to read these reviews and do something about the service or they are just going to keep losing customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=600

On one visit, the manager was just strolling around while our credit card sat on the table for a good 20 minutes before the server came by to pick it up. That's been the only constant, waiting to close out. The last three times we have been there, I put my card out halfway through the meal before the check even comes because I don't want to be sitting forever after my meal. Last time the wrong beer was brought for my fiance by a runner, and the bartender came over and said ""wrong beer, bud"" and grabbed it away like my fiance had picked up the wrong one.

BJ's use to have good quality food, but something changed the last few times I've dined here. The portions seemed to have shrank a lot and they're even missing garnishes. I always order the avocado rolls, and I usually order the BBQ chicken pizza, but it was so disappointing last time that I decided to order some sliders instead. The avocado egg rolls were cut very poorly. Whoever cut it must not have been paying attention, half of the rolls were tiny bite sizes and the other half were three times the bite size. The avocado egg rolls seem to have shrank in size big time. The sliders were dry and overcooked. It lacked flavor and the beef was tiny. Our server seemed to have been missing a majority of the time. I use to frequent the BJ's in Irvine since it's close to my house, but I stopped going there because the food was flat out disappointing the last time I visited.

I was there on opening day and yes, it was a madhouse, but what can you expect. After my first trip, I went back again this past week because the avocado egg rolls were calling me. The bartender told me it would be 45 minutes for some reason or another so it kinda sucked. However, the manager apologised and comped me on another app of my choice.  Now, I can see improvements coming service-wise and they could use MORE tv's if they want to attract sports fans. I'm interested to see what happens when the East Tavern bowling lanes open around the corner in the mall. The BEST part of this place I have to say are the PEOPLE I've met on my visits. Such nice folks and I've actually stayed longer chatting with them. This place is a welcome spot for me and I'll be going back for sure either with friends or alone.

Went here once, and the food was mediocre for everyone's meal so we tried it again, thinking it was just a one time thing...we were wrong. Our table ordered a deep dish veggie pizza (assuming it would be hard to mess up) but it turned out to be the worst pizza I've had at a restaurant. Seriously, dominos was better quality. When the pizza arrived I grabbed the spatula to take a piece and the pizza flopped over onto itself dumping all of the toppings onto the other side because it only had one diagnol cut splitting the pizza in half instead of slices. The waitress watched this and brought it back to actually have it cut correctly. When we began to eat, it was clear that they had baked the dough separately from the rest of the ""pizza"" because nothing stuck to the dough! The toppings had no sauce and hardly any cheese (which is why the toppings simply fell off when when you attempted to eat it). It was like eating a glob of greasy fry bread with an extremely salty salad on top. There were intermittent chunks of overpowering herbs and the veggies were pretty much raw... It was just plain gross. We came in around 1:30 with a very light lunch crowd so there was no excuse for our thrown together ""pizza"".

Last week it was my birthday. She asked me what I wanted to do. I said we have to go to BJs! After I said this, her eyes said no, but she could tell how excited I was about it and she knew she couldn't deny me this time. I actually can't remember the last time I went there even though she knows I frickin' love the place. In fact the last time I had been there may have been my birthday last year. Way too long! Anyway, I'll get down to the experience... I was blown away! Everything was moist and nothing took too long to come to the table. The only complaint, and this is just nitpicking, is that I think my girlfriend's food may have been a bit overdone because she complained about a sore jaw. But I had an amazing time!

The wait staff was friendly and not in a (I'm just trying to earn a good tip and keep my job kind of way) we received genuine smiles and friendly banter. Our waiter even took our picture when he saw our group failing miserably at attempting to take a selfie... Well a groupie lol. Reason Why I'm NOT giving a full 5 stars is because as it was packed...it was incredibly hot and stuffy. My shrimp scampi was a large portion but was not a true scampi sauce and there wasn't much sauce at all. It was a little bland. The copious amounts of parmesan cheese saved it. Took awhile to get someone to take our drink order. Lastly, the spinach /artichoke dip was horrible. Flavor -less and not spinach or artichoke.  The Pizookies were delicious and the atmosphere was nice. We had a great time and everyone around us appeared to be having a great time as well.

However, I've eaten there twice and found it wanting. I don't even remember what I had the first time. Last Friday: chicken lettuce cups (meh) and the ""giant stuffed baked potato"" with their chili. The potato is giant (I split it with a friend), I'll give them that. But stuffed? I was merely sliced down the middle with a schmeer of chili and some cheddar cheese melted over the top with a dollop of sour cream. There was a teeny little dish of extra chili on the side. We asked for extra chili, and got about a cup's worth; still there was a LOT of plain potato to choke down.  We sat inside, rather than outside with heat lamps and the inevitable, random wafts of cigarette smoke. Inside the lighting was so dim we could hardly read the menus and the music so loud we could barely hear one another.  I told the waitress I'm gluten intolerant, but the gluten-free, thin crust, cheese-only pizza for $9.25 (with each additional toppings $1) didn't appeal to me. (It would be nice if they just offered the GF crust as an option with all their specialty pizzas.)  The waitress offerd to bring me a ""gluten-free menu,"" but instead it turned out to be their entire food menu reprinted in very tiny font in the form of a chart, cross-referencing every common food allergen. It didn't say whether the black dot in the coordinating square meant that the menu item contained or was free of the allergen indicated. So, since I forgot to bring my magnifying-glass-flashlight, I just opted for what I thought would be safe off the regular menu. Hence the Lettuce Cups, which were sprinkled with fried won tons (gluten) and the giant non-stuffed tuber. Lettuce Cups (appetizer) + Giant Chili-""stuffed"" Potato + mini Gluten-free Pizooki = $24.

Kevin C.,"Vista, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/16/2014,"I've been to other BJ's locations before, this visit did not measure up.  We went for lunch with some friends on a Sunday afternoon and ended up wishing that we had not recommended BJ's as a place to meet.  When we arrived it took about 30 minutes to get seated, which is reasonable.  However, once we were seated we did not see any food for almost an hour, not even the appetizer.  Once the appetizer arrived it was not even what we ordered, we were told that what we ordered was not available at the moment so they brought us a substitute.  about 15 minutes after that our food arrived, at least 3 out of 5 orders.  Apparently two of the orders were dropped in the kitchen.  After all of that, the food was just not very good.  The hand tossed pizza was floppy and fell apart, the deep dish was just a ball of grease, and our daughters fries and tenders were cold and dry.  The one thing that I was looking forward to was the pizookie, but after all of that I didn't order desert.  I just didn't have the time. Unfortunately it just seemed that the place was not being managed very well at all.  The only reason I'm giving a star is because the manager did check on us and was very apologetic for the service.  She ended up comping us on a few items which did take out a bit of the sting.  She even offered a gift card but we had already decided that we would not be coming back, at least not to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=660

We have visited here several times since June 2010, and it's gotten much better. For the most part, the service has improved. It's still super crowded, but now if you call ahead, your wait time is actually closer to 5 minutes than 30 minutes. Food is always good.  I use BJ's to cater a few client lunches, and everyone loves it! My favorite dish is the Santa Fe Salad with Blackened Salmon (the salmon is always cooked just right).  My favorite pizzas are the Cheeseburger Pizza and the Artichoke/Spinach.  Make sure that if you order takeout, call your order in, and try to avoid online ordering.  It's faster if you call them directly.  Curbside service rocks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=660

When our server came to our table she looked a little depressed. We exchanged ""how are yous"" and she stated that she has been better and that she was having a bad day. So after that, service became terrible. She forgot some of our drinks and refilled our sodas with water, among other things. We started to think that she tells everyone she is having a bad day so that people could feel sorry for her or maybe she just sucks at being a server so she has to make up an excuse. Yes that was mean. But in my opinion, you need to suck it up and do your job and try your hardest to push through. Seeing her depressed made us depressed. But other than that, the food was pretty good. We had the southwestern pizza, broccoli cheddar soup, and pulled pork sandwich. Everything was delicious.

I have food allergies and was very specific about my order. Dressing on the side, add a side of BBQ sauce. The order came and the side of dressing was missing as was the BBQ sauce. Frustrating. My son also wanted extra dressing and they only brought one, gave it to my son, then later after I asked AGAIN brought mine. My chicken in my cesar salad was undercooked and slimy. I asked for new chicken. Some of the lettuce in the bottom of my bowl looked like black slime. It was just so gross. The place is noisy, the waiters are pleasant but forgetful, and the lemonade tasted very acidic like a sour drink mix. Nasty. Their chicken is very moist, still bordering on slimy even well done.

Positive: Lot's of variety on the menu, affordable lunch prices, good selection for children (even ""healthy"" sides).  Big beautiful bar and good beer selection!  Better than anything else in Escondido! Negative: Corporate restaurant (You gotta love the small individual places that have more personality).  Waiters seemed a little confused.  I ordered a pizookie for my niece (she's 3 years old) and they brought the regular size.  They need to make sure they distinguish sizes.  Especially when  I asked my niece what flavor she wanted.  The waitress was really cool about it but the food runner seem baffled!  No biggie, clarification when taking orders helps!! FOOD:  My Dad ordered the lunch portion shrimp tacos and he really enjoyed them.  I had the veggie pizza on the ""lighter"" lunch section.  I am surprised the pizza is considered ""light"", its deep-dish.  Also, I asked for very light cheese and it was covered in cheese.  My nieces each got chicken fingers off the kids menu and they probably could have shared one (they are both under 5 yrs. old).  The kids Oreo pizookie was sweet and yummy.  It would be a good size for two adults ( for people who just like a couple bites of dessert) Give B.J.'s time and it will flourish into the corporate ""goodness"" it is!  Lord knows that North County inland needs anything decent.  All we need now is for the bowling alley to open up!  I am looking forward to drinking B.J.'s beer and going bowling!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-escondido?start=560

Jerry G.,"Lindenwold, NJ",0,171,6,1.0,3/15/2015,"I want to first say that the food was good. However everything else was horrific. First it took at least 10 minutes before we had our drink order taken. It took so long my wife went to the bathroom ,  changed our daughters diaper and still had time to select meals from the menu before our drink order was taken. So when the waitress came over our entire order was taken.  We ordered an appetizer which arrived about 10 minutes later but still no drinks.  When the drinks were finally brought out waitress. Said the order was up but we still didn't get in for another 10 minutes. It was obviously sitting under the warmer because when we receive out food, the lettuce garnish was wilted and the cold cucumber Sauce was warm not cold.  During our meal the waitress took my glass for a refill of just water for at least 5 minutes. So my choice was let my good get cold or not have a drink.  Lastly after our meal we used the restroom, 2 of 3 toilets were plugged up and the door on the third was broken, if the bathroom is gross is what t is the kitchen like.  They had plenty of staff service is just lousy and unfriendly.

Winnie L.,"San Diego, CA",35,118,54,2.0,3/15/2012,"Your RESERVATION policy is awful. The call ahead is a total sham. The alleged premise is you call in your party ahead of time and get priority seating when you arrive. The guy who answered told me that as soon as I arrive, check in with the hostess and it would be a 10 mins wait. As soon as I arrived, the hostess said 25 mins. I didn't bother arguing with her about the false advertisement, but 30 mins later I realized that this whole thing is a joke.  I approached the hostess and she told me that it would be another 5-10 mins. I told her that when I called her coworker told me 10 mins and now its been triple the time. She apologized and said that they are waiting for tables to clear and that the guy answering the phone has no.idea what's happening out here. I responded, ""then someone needs to tell him not to give wrong information over the phone because I came here under the impression it would be a short wait."" The hostess apologized again and said that they have a lot of people and that there were other callers too. I know its not her fault, but if I really wanted to, I could've totally continued on that debate with her that its essentially not my fault I was given wrong info and her managers should enforce their supposedly great call in policy more true to what it advertises.

While on vacation in this area, we decided to stop by the Escondido BJ's. It's a chain restaurant, so we thought we knew what to expect; unfortunately, this location really, really let us down. It was packed at lunch time on a Saturday; for a party of 7, it was about a 45 minute wait. It wouldn't have been a problem if there hadn't have been open tables that I could see from our waiting spot that the hostesses were too busy flirting with the servers to notice. The table we were eventually sat at was open for over 10 minutes, and I could hear an audible ""oops"" from the hostess when she realized this (we were literally the only customers waiting, so she was not going back looking for tables at all). The portion sizes at this BJ's are WAY smaller than at other locations. My mom and sister ordered the pasta with marinara sauce, and they put the wrong sauce (spicy marinara instead of regular marinara). My mom cannot eat spicy foods, and asked for a new dish. All the waitress did was bring out plain noodles and a side of sauce, and it took almost 20 minutes. Everyone was finished eating before my mom even got her food.

Again, he called on Saturday to change the headcount and again they had the reservation time wrong. finally they got it right, but still, with a party that big you don't want to be stressing.
