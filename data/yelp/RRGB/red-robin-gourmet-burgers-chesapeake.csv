Krystal R.,"Hampton, VA",71,34,21,5.0,7/19/2017,Red robin is one of this places you cant pass up  from the lively environment to the cheap and fast service.  Oh did I add they have bottomless steak fries and I can't juat have one batch.  Their probably one of the few restaurants who actually offer an actual free meal on your birthday when your signed up for their birthday program. I can't get enough of their veggie burgers they do them right yessirrrr!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake

We said something to him, he didn't care.  We immediately walked out. Learn how to treat your customers.

Kimberly D.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,18,4,1.0,7/12/2017,"UPDATE: After my review I was informed of a website:  This website allows you to look up any food facility in Chesapeake and view a list of their violations. This location of Red Robin had violations in June 2017 for employees not washing their hands, uncovered food, unclean surfaces and more. No inspection or re-inspection has been done since June 2017. YUCK!!! JULY 2017 POST: This Red Robin location is filthy.  The menus are sticky, the condiments left on the tables are sticky and the seats are never wiped down very good.  The floors under the table are nasty with food so you constantly step in it.  Yuck!!  You can watch the kitchen staff as the kitchen is open to the sitting area. We never saw any hair nets, beard nets, and gloves were few and far between.  We watched people rub the sweat from their head, wipe their nose with the back of their hand, scratch their arm, etc... and then proceed to cook the food.  It amazes me that food manufacturing plants have staff fully covered (head cover, facial hair cover, foot covers, and gloves - all in order to protect your packaged food. Yet, many restaurants just don't care.  When I see this stuff, I just lose my appetite.   They really need to step up their cleaning routine. How does this stuff pass with the inspectors?  If this is just what we could see, what did the place look like that we could not see?  Scary to think about. When you go - make sure you take several antibacterial wet wipes with you!  The wait staff is hit or miss on a good one.  You can tell some just hate their jobs and it reflects in their attitude. You have to accept their rudeness isn't personal and ignore it or ask for someone else.   Last, this is a family restaurant so 80% of the time there will be loud/screaming kids.   Did I mention they have a full bar?  I highly recommend you visit this.  It helps you ignore all of the above concerns.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake

Maria C.,"Chesapeake, VA",425,563,9169,5.0,6/12/2017,"I'm here for the burgers and the chicken sandwiches!  I haven't tried anything else, but this place always delivers deliciousness. Yearly, I receive a birthday burger reward and I'm always looking forward to redeeming it.  So this year, I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken.  Super amazing!! It features: grilled chicken breast, teriyaki, grilled pineapple, melted Swiss, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo for $9.99.  But I had it without the tomatoes and mayo.   Super good!!   But on any day you'll pay $9.99, but if you sign up for their awesome birthday program you received a gourmet burger/chicken sandwich for FREE!   Definitely something to look forward too! The sandwich also comes with a side and I ordered broccoli.  So good!!   Cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  My orders are usually to-go and the pick up is at the bar area!  Although I have dined here one time and it was on the patio - beautiful!  I love it here and will continue to come again and again.

Monica O.,"Richmond, VA",4,100,148,1.0,11/22/2017,"I would most definitely give this location a 0! I was extremely disappointed!! My food was COLD! The cheese and chicken were very, very cold! I ordered the whisky river bbq chicken wrap. I order that at every Red Robin I go to, and it was just an awful experience. I wasn't pleased with the waitress what's so ever. The fries were hard and room temperature and the waitress didn't even offer if we wanted any more fries! IWILL NOT be returning. I was very displeased. Practically any other location is better. The greeters were bad as well. When we walked in the male greeter assumed we weren't first and treated us poorly!! Then as we were leaving we did not receive a ""have a nice day"" greeting.

Jessica P.,"Chesapeake, VA",101,109,61,5.0,5/30/2017,"I love Red Robin. I am obsessed. My absolute favorite is just a classic cheeseburger. Red Robin tavern is what I dream about at night. Two mini patties with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese. Insert heart eyes emoji.  Hubby has been on the blue ribbon kick. He's obsessed. And he loves the onion straws.  The sweet potato fries are really good. Their salad is good. Their broccoli is good. Their fries are terrible.  I hate their fries. They're steak fries. But I can look past it for their burgers. But please get rid of the steak fries. And we upgraded to Parmesan garlic fries. Not worth it. Not much garlic flavor and just seems like they're dripping in oil. And once again, they're steak fries. Ughhhh.  Pro tip: get the chipotle aioli and mix it with ketchup. Sweet and spicy dip for your fries. Or sauce your burger up with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake

Xavier C.,"Chesapeake, VA",228,182,37,4.0,12/20/2016,"Le sigh - 46 reviews. I need to invest stock in this particular store. If you follow my reviews you can see an evolution in my visits. This place is continually evolving. It's almost sad how welcomed we are when people see us (we're good tippers too), but it's nice seeing them improving little by little. Change on this type of a magnitude doesn't happen easily as it has to be a culture change. Overall, the food quality has become more consistent and service tight.

Tamekia F.,"Chesapeake, VA",106,64,207,4.0,11/9/2016,"I came to actually get my free birthday burger. For those who don't know if you are a royal Red Robin member one of the perks is that you get a free burger and fries during your birthday month. The cool thing about here is that you get the entire month to use it! Most places do within a week or the same day so that is pretty awesome. Had some zesty ranch dip and chips for an app. The dip was good and there was a lot of it. It actually tasted great with the fries I had later on. I decided to go with the burnin love burger on ciabatta bread. I asked for it cooked medium and it was the most perfectly cooked burger. Couldn't have asked for it to be cooked any differently. It was soooooooo good. Can't wait to go back. Red Robin is one of those places I don't go to often, but then when I do I always question what took me so long to return lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake
Cindy E.,"Norfolk, VA",185,392,550,4.0,8/29/2016,"Even though I used to go here for my lunch break at least once a week when I worked at Dillard's in Chesapeake Square Mall (throwback!), I can't remember a single thing I ever ate. Literally. I can tell you my lunch date liked his food and ginormous beer and service was quick cause we got back to work in an hour. But that was when Chesapeake Square wasn't dying because Harbour View was still just a buncha land with nothing going on except [Broken] Egg Bistro, Walmart, and Tropical Smoothie. But I digress.  Ten years later, I'm eating Red Robin Burgers. Once a year. Cause they're free on your birthday, when you sign up in advance. But even if they weren't free, I just might pay for one of those bad boys. Much better than the free Ruby Tuesday birthday burger options. And well, if you're gonna get a chain restaurant's burger, you should get the best. Red Robin. Yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake
Vania C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",13,118,221,3.0,10/25/2016,"I would be lying if I said I didn't love burgers. Red Robin is a stop we make about every 2-4 months because it's in the neighborhood.  An average faster food place. My biggest gripe? My heart sinks when I think of their fries. A burger place that give bottomless fries yet never are they hot, fresh fries. Not ever. I don't want bottomless bad fries. I assume it is an economic strategy - intentional done to discourage reordering, to balance out the 'bottomless' aspect.  I had The Southern Charm $13.99 tonight, some pink. Cooked nicely. Pink and juicy. That was good. Ciabatta bun was uninspiring and cold, grainy. Bad pairing. The burger was shockingly sweet, so sweet. No kidding. There was brown sugar all over the place and hardly any grilled onions to balance it out. I did not enjoy this burger. And regretted paying that kind of money for what I received. What I do normally like are the short stack onion rings. This evening there was a bitter aftertaste that comes from frying different things in the same oil too many times. A disappointment for us since this is something that usually goes well. They keep your Soda refilled. We all have our quirks, and this is a big thing with me. That's 1 star right there. The monthly special burger is usually good, though they may not be able to make it the same way twice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake

Carissa K.,"Harrisburg, PA",50,372,7089,4.0,9/12/2015,"I've been slacking with my reviews lately, and I realized I have never written a review for one of my favorites--Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RR). Ever since I became a Yelp addict, I pretty much stay away from chains. However, RR is one of the exceptions.  There is something about the atmosphere at RR that I enjoy. The décor is fun, and the dining room is open, but it can become very loud when it's busy. When we walked in the other day, we noticed they had remodeled and the sign said: ""Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews."" The new décor is a bit classier and upscale--we loved it! They also now have touchscreen Ziosk tablets on all tables, which enables customers to order food on their own and not needing to wait for the bill at the end of their meal.  We have always had good service at RR, but sometimes it can take a while for the food to come out. On our last visit using the Ziosk, our food was super fast. I think Ziosk will help with that particular issue. Our waitress was awesome--friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. If you need your server, there is a ""call your server"" button on your Ziosk.  Most of the time, we all order burgers and we are happy with their food. I've also tried many of their salads and appetizers--pretty decent. Just like most chains, their food can be salty depending on what you order. I would recommend sticking with their burgers as that's what they do best. Bonus: you get bottomless fries with your burgers! RR is a popular choice for my family because of many different reasons:  1) It is fairly close by.  2) My boys love burgers, and sometimes I want a sit-down meal instead of fast food burgers.  3) We all can agree on RR.  4) Baron's Pub in town is a better value and better burgers, but sometimes I'm looking for the atmosphere.  5) RR really caters to families. I am a fan, Red Robin! Yummmmmmm...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake

The presentation was great, the kaiser roll was fresh and topped with a large jalapeño. The fries were hot, just as I like it...however, there was no ketchup on my table.

Our waitress Mary was very good - kept drinks refilled and dilivered food timely and helped with special requests for extra pickles and rang up a beer on happy hour price just in time (and delivered it when I was ready).   I also liked that the Manager came by and asked how everything was.  I was glad to inform him it was great. The burgers were awersome as always.  I had the Bacon Cheese Burger w Blue Cheese and Monica had the Chop House Burger - both were hot and cooked the way we requested.  We had a Caesar Salad before our burgers and after the mini Brats and it was very good and served with a tasty piece of Pita. This isn't the cheapest place to go for a burger but the service was great and the food was delicious and it is the only place I know of with Mini Brats with that great relish as an appetizer.

Shanae S.,"Suffolk, VA",149,134,250,4.0,11/18/2015,"Ok Red Robin I see you have updated the place! I like! We came here, a party of 3, looking for a good burger. They did not let us down! I ordered the Peppercorn A1 steakhouse burger and it was WHOA! So good! My husband got the new Smoke &Pepper burger and he said it was super flavorful. The kiddo got the Mac n cheese and loved it of course. Here is where my problem comes in. I can appreciate the new ""gourmet burger"" approach but why lose the stuff that made me like u to begin with?! So they still have bottomless fries but they stopped the second bowl of mac n cheese for the kids! My 5 yr old was like ""what the what!"" Then I asked for a side of the chipotle aioli because I wasn't sure if I would like it on my burger... It was good. But they charged me .75 for it!! Since when do u charge for condiments? Then the low key ""enjoy the entertainment console while u wait"" and then charged us $2 for my girl playing tic tac toe... And then the automatic added 18% gratuity if u don't catch it u might give more than u intended. So, it was good food, a nice server but look out for the nickel and diming..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=40
Stephanie T.,"Decatur, GA",102,202,104,3.0,4/20/2013,"I have eaten at Red Robin a number of times as I have a 12 year old son who loves the place.  Everything about this location is just ok.  The service here is disappointing, I've yet to have a really good server which is sad as I've eaten here well over 10 times. My most recent visit I went with my husband and son.  I cannot remember what they ordered but it must have been tasty as they inhaled their burgers almost as soon as they hit the table.  As for me I ordered the guacamole burger (medium) and as far as I could tell there wasn't a speck of guac on that burger and it was certainly cooked well done (actually VERY well done would be a better description)  I asked the server if I could get a side of guac so that I could salvage the meal however, when she brought it out to the table I could see why they neglected to put it on the burger.  It was mostly brown, not fresh at all and tasted horrid!  I was so shocked, at this point I ended up just sending it back, as I'd only taken two bites of my burger and only had one or two of my sweet potato fries. I did point out to the server that I asked for my burger medium and that it was past well.  She kinda mumbled an apology and took the meal away and off of your check.  The manager did come over and ask it she could make me something else, I declined.  All and all it was a disappointing visiting.  I will return again just no time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=40

Mach S.,"Isle of Wight County, VA",4,145,31,1.0,8/18/2013,"My family has eaten here many times, but this was the first time we got a raw-meat burger! I kid you not, this burger was bright red in the center, not pink, but red and bloody. Honestly, how hard can it be to cook a burger at a burger joint. It is all you do, day in and day out. Red Robin should be able to cook burgers in their sleep.  It must be a Chesapeake Square Mall thing, because a few years ago, the Outback Steak House there served me a raw-meat steak. It had been braised on the outside, but all purple on the inside. Yuck! RR made things worse, when they refused to comp the entire meal. When you poison one member of the family with a  raw-meat burger, it might go along way to comp the $4.99 kids meal too. I guess RR feels that raw-meat or not, we're all stupid and will probably be back. Nope, never again! Now my wife is waiting for a full bore case of E-coli now. It's like waiting for Santa to arrive....from hell! Yuck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=40
Meredith V.,"Alexandria, VA",275,825,463,4.0,7/29/2012,"Our go-to for eating out with the kids and a screaming toddler! The food isn't rocket science, but they do offer an assortment of salads and sandwiches with a ton of kids menu options and not too shabby wine list. Plus...who can turn down endless steak fries?

Chris R.,"Chesapeake, VA",5,22,6,3.0,6/17/2014,"Red Robin is what I would expect it to be, another chain restaurant that offers decent food. There is nothing wrong with the burgers and the bottomless fries are good, considering that they're bottomless, it makes it a little bit better. Our waitress did a great job, considering we had a party of 22. I have never had a problem with Red Robin and it cracks me up when person has one bad experience out of the many times they have been and they give them one star. I don't think one star is warranted, but anything above average is crazy talk.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=40
Yelp W.,"Washington, DC",2,79,,3.0,6/13/2012,"Food: This was my first time at Red Robin and I was not disappointed. I got the A1 Peppercorn Burger without fried onions. I decided to get sauteed onions instead and it came out good. They let me substitute the bun for a Kaiser Roll so I am sure that made my burger even better.  The bottomless fries kept coming and they were cool considering they were steak fries, which I am not too much of a fan of.  Workers: No complaints here.  Atmosphere: It was more than I expected. They have nice lighting in Red Robin. TV's everywhere. They were playing Dexter's Laboratory but that was only because there were a lot of kids there for a party. I watched some Dexter while I was waiting for my food.  I would go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=40

We saw 5 waitresses and they had light traffic in the restaurant.  The manager blew past us three times. The only people that bothered to say anything were the hostesses and that was really just the sheer disbelief that we were walking out because we didn't get any service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=40
Russ B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,10,,5.0,1/1/2011,"Great Service made for a very positive experience. I've been to this location before and the experience was fairly good (the burgers are ALWAYS great), but yesterday I went with my wife and my parents who are from out of town.   My father can be a little grumpy and difficult to please when he goes out to eat, so the service he gets is usually just as important, if not more important, than the quality of the food. Our waitress, Betzy, deserves huge compliments for her genuine service.   There is nothing worse than fake friendliness.  But Betzy brought some seriously honest personality to the mix that made for a very enjoyable meal.     We were a little concerned when she said she promised to put a big smile on my dad's face by the time he was done eating, but she definitely delivered. As usual the burgers were awesome.   The new pub burger was very flavorful and cooked just right.    As a small business owner obsessed about customer service, I'm hoping the service like that from Betzy is recognized and replicated throughout the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=40

S B.,"Portsmouth, VA",0,11,,1.0,7/8/2012,"I have been taking my grandkids to this Red Robin since the week it opened. Went the other day with one of my grandsons and was refused a table up front and where we always sit, and given a table in the back where the heat was unbearable. After our meal, leaving the restaurant we walked by the front section and there was a man sitting with his two children, I don't know how he got a seat and we didn't. Another grandson (12 years old) wanted to go today and we were refused a table up front and I asked to speak to the manager and was told that the front area was for adults only, she was not very friendly and could not give me an answer why we had seen children in the front area after we were refused a table. My grandson wanted to watch the Nationals game. I have never had any problems with any grandchild misbehaving in this or any restaurant. I always considered this to be a child friendly restaurant, but will not be returning ever. We went to this restaurant at least once a week, but will no spend our money elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake?start=60
