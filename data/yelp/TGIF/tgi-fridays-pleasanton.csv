Mark G.,"Livermore, CA",6,182,6,3.0,11/16/2010,"Bar & Grill Chains fight for your soul. Friday's, A-Bees, the big Pepper's, and others of their ilk are locked in an eternal battle over your patronage.  They all have nice, glossy menus with food that can't look or taste that good.  Pushing flavor and timely specials they lure you in before your eyes notice the brighter lights down the street.  If the food isn't exciting enough, the wood grain benches and plasma televisions with your manly sports game will help keep you in the seats with an extra order of beer. In the 90's, TGIF was a treat to visit.  The novelty wall decor was then novel.  Not quite a burger place, nor a steak place, not quite a sports bar, it was something anyone could relate too.  You could have a beer, mixed drink, deep fried appetizer, anything that was double the price of fast food but with service.  Today, TGIF relies on the Jack Daniel's brand to conjure an illusion of exclusivity in otherwise staple of menu items.   It had been years since I had visited a Friday's, not once since we had moved to CA.  It was lunchtime and we were in the mood to try something new. The parking lot can be a pain to make it to if you didn't know better by pulling into Rosewood and snaking your way though the strip mall.  The interior was clean and quiet.  We were one of very few customers in the early day.  There are many items to choose, but mostly grouped in how you want your burger or chicken cooked.  What toppings, what sauce?  I went ahead for the Jack Daniel's burger at nearly 1100 calories!  The sauce appears to be a mix of high fructose corn syrup and brown sugar.     Pros: Menus come with calories.  Notice how much extra energy are in meals with come in specialty sauces like Jack Daniel's. Burger was tasty.  I chose to eat half, save rest for later. Fries: I know they probably come poured out from a freezer bag, but I liked the taste. Offering clam chowder before noon. Cons: My wife was ill after eating the chowder.  We're not sure how much real clams were in there to begin with. Soft drinks are too expensive at $2.99.  That is at the far end of the curve for most all restaurants and pushes the tab too high for customers to return quickly. The service was decent, my food was good while my wife's experience will delay a return and without the chowder.  I still rank this above A-Bees and may return to the place with the giant red pepper in front to update my original review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=20
Jessica D.,"Portland, OR",168,148,46,1.0,3/7/2010,"Am I in a restaurant or am I in a bar who thinks it's a restaurant? Came in, late night, it was ""Hawaiian Night"" and there was a DJ. The music was lame, the patrons around the bar were rejects from the clubs around the area, and the service made me cringe. Mind you, sat in the main dinning area and wasn't out for clubbing. ""Hawaiian Night"" makes you think of happy waiters/waitresses dressed to impressed. Our waitress should have just worn a Hawaiian t-shirt for her sake and ours. The food was mundane. Waitress forgot our request of salsa when we first put our order in for the kid with us. The drinks, I've had better... The music was terrible and the DJ - someone from craigslist? Friday night, pick a better location - unfortunately I couldn't as I'm not from the area.

Alysia W.,"East Bay, CA",3301,592,72,2.0,9/23/2009,I had a bbq chicken tossed salad today and it was absolutely delicious! The one thing I noticed about their menu here is that they include the calorie count for every dish and drink. While some people may like that.. I don't! I want to choose something delicious to eat without having to feel guilty about how many calories I just shoved down my throat.. Even some of the salads had well over 1000 calories! So much for trying to eat healthy.. But aside from that the restaurant had nice servers but incredibly slow service.

Rey B.,"San Ramon, CA",87,27,,1.0,7/20/2011,"We used to eat at this TGI Friday's all the time.  Tonight was the LAST night we'll eat here again.  Our service was south of ""good"".  The place wasn't very crowded (Wednesday night), but it took forever to get our order in.  The accommodated us by letting our table be split into two bills (two families), and honored the two coupons that we had.  From there....things went downhill.  Our server told us we'd have complimentary chips/salsa with one of our coupons, and she started us off with that.  There was a hint of attitude from her when we were ordering, but not enough to raise any suspicion of what was to come.  My brother ordered his steak ""medium"", and I ordered mine ""medium well"".  Both came out ""well done""...near burnt.  The other meals for our table came out satisfactory, as far as I can tell. After receiving our meals, our waitress came by once.  I would expect better attention at any restaurant.  At least walk by and ask if we needed anything....you know, like a refill on drinks.  We practically had to beg for our bill after we finished our meals.  When our bills came out, one bill was wrong.  The other family that we were with went to get their bill fixed, and complained about the (lack of) service. I've never stiffed a tip in my life (until now).  I originally left a 12% tip, which everyone thought was too generous for our service anyway, but I just can't write down zero.  As we were walking out, the staff member that was handling our bill checkout said ""Bye.  See you never.""  Whoops, you got caught.  I approached her and asked ""Excuse, me....did you really need to say that?"", followed by a ""You're #$%&*^#@ rude!"".  So, I walked back to our table, scratched out the tip, and don't feel bad one bit.

I've been here a few times, and I always order some chicken dish drenched in JD sauce. This week I had the lunch bruschetta pasta with chicken. The angel hair pasta was boring, but at least it had fresh tomatoes and other extras. The chicken was overcooked and not the highest quality. I guess that's what to expect for $6.99 lunch.

I really appreciate places that adapt to their surroundings and this is one of them. The food is pretty decent, not epic, but hey, it's a restaurant chain! The wings are pretty darn good though, and their loaded skins are legendary. Drinks? No better place for a good cocktail at a small price!

Kimbera provided crappy service (virtually ignored us as she bent over backwards for the two large African American patrons that were scarfing down ribs and chicken and requesting refills on drinks, napkins, and to-go boxes). We ordered the All-American Chicken Sandwich and the Southwest Mac & Cheese. First of all, let me say that although prices have gone down a little, portions have gone down a helluva lot. I'm assuming this is an effort to cut costs while attempting to convince consumers that they are serving ""portions sized just right"" in order to ""help"" us all eat ""healthier."" What a crock. They no longer have ketchup bottles on the table, so if you want ketchup, you get a little ramekin of it. The mac & cheese was mildly warm and the cheese looked, tasted, and felt like it had been sitting under a warming lamp for too long. Did I mention the portions were small? The sandwich was okay, nothing special. And sometime during our meal, Kimber and another waitress were wiping down the walls. No, it's not because some kid threw food all over them. It looked like a regular part of the job description: ""Wipe walls and musty hanging table lamps."" Um, could this be done when customers aren't trying to eat? It wasn't near closing; it was around 8:00. And if she's going to wipe the walls (which you can be sure I'm not touching anyway), could she possibly wipe the sticky dessert menu as well?

Me:  Well, that was the reason we came here was the soup & yes I would like the sauce. Ditz:  Oh ok, it won't be long for the soup. She comes back very timely with the soup, & told us she was sorry, that they would comp us the soup.  So plus 1 there to try & make it right.  She took back off before I could inquire about the BBQ sauce & the fact that my gf's rib portion was significantly smaller than mine.  I finally flagged her down & asked.  She took off for the sauce, but offered no explanation or anything else about the rib portion.  She comes back with the BBQ sauce as we are finishing up our ribs & drops the check off.  I give her my card & she returns to tell us to have a good day.  I asked if we could have some of the towlets for our hands & she took off for those...I assumed.  I saw her coming back our way, we make eye contact & she stops in her tracks, does an about face, heads into the kitchen & emerges seconds later with the towlets.  I guess I had assumed she would bring 3, since there were 3 of us.  There were only 2!  I guess you can't win 'em all!

WTF?  The restaurant was pretty empty.   The only positive thing about this visit were their lunch specials.  I had my usual - Bruschetta Chicken Pasta.  This dish never disappoints.  In the past, this dish came w/bread but it doesn't anymore so I had to order a basket of garlic breadsticks.  The breadsticks had no flavor.  They were warm & fluffy but where was the garlic???  I was pleased that they offered Bruschetta Chicken Pasta in their lunch menu for a cheaper price and 1/2 the portion.  It was still plentiful so I had lunch it for lunch the next day.  11/3 = 2 stars My cousin hit me up to go to lunch before his trip for Guatemala.  I decided to give TGIF another try but this time I asked to be seated in their main dining room in hopes for better service. Our server was more attentive & very friendly but the wait time for our food did not change. In addition, I was unpleasantly surprised that they completely changed their lunch menu.  They no longer offer Bruschetta Chicken Pasta as a lunch special and their new lunch options did not look appetizing.  So screw it, I'll pay the full price for my usual.  When I find something I like I tend to stick to it. My food finally arrives but why did the meal also change???  This was always served with Angel Hair pasta.  Today it was served with Fettucini. Did they run out of Angel Hair or is this their new way of preparing it?  If it is, I'm never ordering it again.  Totally dissatisfied.

Now onto the food: I can't believe I'm going to say this but these were the best fries I've had in a long time.  So crispy and on the thin side and great tasting.  I didn't need any ketchup at all.  Maybe it's key to always get the first fries of the day so that the oil is fresh? I ended up ordering the Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich and my husband got the Jack Daniel's Burger.  Lots of bacon and cheese and great flavors.  Once again, I was shocked.

With football on the screens and affordable drinks it has been great all season - also much less crowded than other places so I don't have to worry about trying to get service or seating once a game has started.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=80
JOE S.,"Hayward, CA",14,9,2,4.0,2/5/2008,"Went here on ""SUPERBOWL SUNDAY"" with my Fiance & room mate and had an excellent time there, food was great. Had one of there burgers (Jack Daniels) and it was pretty good; a bit salty ,but it was alright.  also tried there ""Crispy green bean fries"" and they are delicious w/ some wasabi sauce, if you never tried these before, you should.  Then had there fried macaroni (which taste way better than Cheesecake factory).  The service there was excellent , very friendly workers and good atmosphere.  I would definitely come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=80

Bay A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,42,3,1.0,6/24/2007,i normally like TGI Fridays.  so i was excited when i found out there was one in pleasanton.  the food of course is that same as all the others but the service was just crappy.  our waitress just dissappeared for about 30 minutes.  later we found out her shift ended and some fat guy was supposed to be our waiter.  this guy never came over untill about i complained to the manager that we hadnt seen a waiter in over half an hour.  once the guy came he acted like he was mad at me.  imagine that.  so we just walked out i dont like working with pissed off waiters cause i know what they do with your food.  so for sure i wont be back to this tgi ill have to try a different one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=80
Mike M.,"Livermore, CA",1,31,,3.0,1/9/2010,"This Fridays has been around somewhere in the fifteen year range and the inside is really starting to show signs of needing a face lift.  The mens bathroom is a little gross looking and smelling with the grout between the tiles on the wall being in need of either serious scrubbing or replacement as I'm pretty sure it wasn't that color originally.  The urinal on the right had no intact caulking and was visibly detached from the wall though it did work fine. So why three stars?  Because the food was very well prepared.  Our fried shrimp was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the Salmon was tender and tasty.  The fries were also very good. In addition to the bathrooms I have to say that the whole ""old stuff on the walls"" look is really past its prime.  Especially given the dim lighting. Our waiter was prompt, courteous and got our order 100% correct which was also good. We've been here many times during the time this location has been open and while we don't get there as often these days as we used to the experience is still solid.  Given the quality of the food and wait staff I'd easily give this location four stars if it they did a moderate remodel to spruce things up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=40
Jason W.,"Akron, OH",303,483,58,2.0,6/5/2008,"Why must coworkers of all walks of life must go to places like this for lunch/dinners?  Seriously, its like every time there is a ""group luncheon"" or ""dinner"" people have to open their traps and mention places like this... So let me get this straight, You want me to pay $50.00 for a half eaten dried out hamburger, one large sprite, and some soggy fries? Last time I check that only totaled me $15 with TIP and and Taxes you cheap bastards...  What? You want me to pay that because you decided to get the fancy punches and refill them 4 - 5 times while ordering the steak meal wuth all the fix'n? Shoot your meal alone is like $45... Oh The Food? it's about as good as their ""frozen appetizers"" you can buy at just about every grocery store. I had some ""wings"" which consisted of something I remembered back in grade school. Remember them nasty ""mystery"" chicken things? Yeah talk about a flash back from 3rd grade rocking Kangaroos and barfing up them dollar lunches.. NO MAS!

Service is OK ... food is OK ... all very average.  This place does average like nobody's business.  I do enjoy the Junebug drink, though, which is no longer on the menu, but you can still get it.  Yes, ordering ""off the menu"" at Friday's.  I am THAT cool. But aside from the mediocrity of food and service, this Friday's in particular brings me fond memories.  When I was in high school, my friends and I had this one crazy waiter practically every time we came here named Jeremy who would always wear a Riddler hat (a la Batman -- this was back when the red and white striped shirts and ""flair"" were still the thing).  My friend Leann got her hair tied with helium balloons for her 16th birthday.  My boyfriend and I went on our first ""date"" here (it wasn't really an official date, and we were 18).  I've celebrated various friends' birthdays here and other special-yet-casual occasions.  I try to visit this place still at least once a year or so just for old time's sake.  Ah, the memories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=40
Reva R.,"Elk Grove, CA",102,64,61,2.0,7/22/2010,"LAME! and that's putting it lightly. If I could give them 11/2 stars I would, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I came here with my family on a, I believe it was a Friday afternoon for lunch. I actually made the suggestion to come here because I had always gone to the Union City location and had yummy and satisfying meals and the service was on point. I thought it might be the same. Boy was I wrong. First off, it's in a  deserted area surrounded by other businesses that seemed to be closed or have been closed for a while. Upon walking in  the lights were very dim and it felt kind of gloomy. We got seated right away, probably being that we were the one of probably 5 families that were there that afternoon. Anyway, our waitress seemed like she was in a rush to seat us and take our order. Then waiting for our meals took FOREVER. And I'm not over exaggerating, my dad and I were able to marvel at almost all of the knick-knacks on the wall. I think I remember it being almost 45 minutes for our food to come out. I mean how long could it take when there were no more than a few other families and others there? The waitress did not apologize for the wait, neither did she come to ask how everything was and if we needed anything during our meal. The food was mediocre, and it did not satisfy, which made for a bunch of grumpy people since we were already starving from waiting for so long. I am definitely not coming back here anytime soon, if ever. I'd rather go the extra mile and go the the Friday's in Union City. At least there I can enjoy my surroundings because the ambiance is a lot more friendly and it won't take years to get my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=40
Kevin W.,"Atlanta, GA",58,255,21,3.0,12/16/2008,"This place was okay. The wait was about 10-15 minutes, yet they had plenty of empty tables? What the... Anyway when we saw that, we just sat ourselves near the bar since it was seat yourself seating anyway. The waiter was friendly, but a little unobservant and slow with checking up on us.  We didn't have silverware by the time our food came, so I got it at the bar after waiting around 10 minutes or so. The waiter only came around 3 times: to come get our order, to drop off the check and to check up on the food like literally 3 minutes after the food came (a food runner brought  us our food).  So all in all, the service sucked, but was friendly when we got it. The food was another story. Our food came hot and smelled delicious. The chicken portion was a little small compared to what I was used to seeing. Both chicken breasts from the jack daniel's chicken was smaller than the size of 1 of my hands. It was tasty though. I normally don't like mashed potatoes, but theirs was something to rave about. It had a cheesy and garlic flavor. Yummy!  All in all it was pretty average because of the service. If I'm near this location again, I'll probably do carry out unless I want to drink to the happy hour specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=40

John D.,"Pleasanton, CA",198,18,,4.0,12/1/2010,"I'm really surprised by all the negative reviews, but then of course it seems that most people will take time to write negative reviews versus positive ones.   In all honesty I don't usually come here to have dinner in the main dining room.  It's usually in the bar area for appetizers and /or dinner.  I'm not a drinker, but they have one of the best happy hours in town from 3 to 7 and then from 10 till closing.  It's hard to find a place that's open in Pleasanton past 10 let alone a happy hour.   The food to me is fine based on what you're paying for it.  As I said happy hour all appetizers are half price and you can always find a ""two for one"" entree coupon if you're on their e-mail or mailing list .   I've never had a bad experience with their food in regards to getting sick and for the money it's better than a lot of other fancier places. However, what I like best about the Pleasanton Friday's are the employees and customers.  If you go to the bar area it's almost like CHeers.  There are the regulars (of which I am one) and the bartenders are all nice and even more so when you get to now them.  QUite frankly sometimes I'm not even hungry, but it's a place to go and socialize. I had to laugh about people complaining about the parking lot.  It's a parking lot for christ's sake, just deal with it! And yes the decor is outdated, but I'll take that over the bright lights and expense of a newer restaurant. Love Friday's in P-Town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pleasanton?start=40

We ordered several items from the menu.  Jack Daniels Chicken Appetizer, Buffalo Wings, Buffalo Chicken Boneless Wings, and Shrimp Cocktail.  The JD Chicken is very similar to the Boneless Buffalo...just different sauce.  A bit too much batter for my taste!  I liked the wings a lot better.  The shrimp cocktail was average at best.  The shrimp did not taste really that fresh, but fresh enough where it wasn't hazardous to your health to eat.   Oh yeah, if you're trying to read the menu on the patio at night, good luck to you!  Very, very little lighting so doing any kind of work out there is impossible, unless you have a flashlight.
