Howard S.,"The Colony, TX",13,358,440,4.0,12/17/2017,"This is a very good restaurant. I used to live in Temple, and we came here often. Stopped in for lunch on a car trip today and it remains a very good restaurant and a very good BJ's.  Our server was very good and friendly, but service seemed a tad bit slow. I had their spicy chicken in soba noodles and my wife their bacon cheeseburger. My dish was very good. The burger was good except the top bun was very dry and fell apart.   The coffee was a very good blend.  I like BJ's because they have an extensive and varied menu with great craft beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple
Terri K.,"Cameron, TX",0,15,1,2.0,8/30/2017,"I've been to several BJ's and this is one of the bottom rated. Maybe its because I come at the ""off hours"" in the afternoon. Wait staff is pretty good but the afternoon cooks seem to be off more often than not. The food is often over cooked. Today was not a good experience. Today I first ordered lemon peppered bone in wings and caeser side salad. After about 15 minutes I was told they were out of any bone in wings. So I reordered for fish and chips. After about another 20 minutes these were brought out and were more plastic than cooked fish. Way over done and lots of breading. One of the managers delivered it. After complaining and sending them back another manager said they cut off the waitress that was explaining when they saw the meal. I reordered a flat bread pizza appetizer.  They finally turned out close to right when it came out. I have been here several times in the mid afternoon and it seems the afternoon cooks need a bit more training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple

J B.,"Plano, TX",13,39,58,2.0,12/26/2017,"We eat at BJ's pretty often.  Stopped at this location on the way home so we could meet up with family living near here.  The food was definitely not the best we have had.  My shrimp scampi had so much oil in it I could have filled half a glass.  The quinoa bowl was 95% rice.  The pizzas were not fully cooked (doughy on bottom).  Chicken on the salad was cold and the coffee was not good. The burger was below average. The kids burgers meat was half the size of the bun. Also, the gluten free pizza may have been cross contaminated with gluten (had symptoms of gluten consumption after eating).  Our waitress was really nice (only reason for the 2).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple

OJIBOY N.,"Grovetown, GA",18,17,19,1.0,12/5/2017,"We used to make special trips just to eat there - especially for the ahi poke tuna and deep dish pizzas. But the past few years the quality and preparation has drastically spiraled. Last time we were there, we spent almost $80 and ate hardly any of the dishes.

Skip D.,"Elm Mott, TX",1,28,2,2.0,10/23/2017,I had ordered their Pork Chop and waiter returned telling me they had no pork chops. I had eat at BJs in Waco before and ordered Pork Chops and they did not have them. Any how I asked for diet coke... nope Pepsi only. So I order a steak medium well. It arrives and cut into it and blood actually squirted from the steak like the heart was still beating. They bring another and I ask for hienz 57... don't have it... only A1. The steak was just okay. The asparagus was very tough. Mashed potatoes were good. There was no offer of any reduction in the price for all the problems. I do not recommend this place at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple

It's a little expensive but it's worth the price! The only downside is that the service has not always been the best, it is normally really good but has occasionally not been amazing. Overall, really good though. I dont enjoy their pizza though, too expensive & not very good. But i would still recommend this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple
Jay J.,"Temple, TX",0,6,,3.0,10/16/2017,"This is the first terrible experience we have had at this location.  We sat down at 4:55pm and there were very few people in the restaurant.  The waitress was running around frantically for no obvious reason.  She finally came over and took our order 15 minutes after we sat down.  Our food (burger and California chicken club) showed up 35 minutes later.  The California chicken club came out with brown avocado and tasted terrible.   The only positive is that the burger tasted pretty good.   We sat there for another 15 to 20 minutes waiting for the server to bring the check.  We really wanted dessert but didn't want to wait another hour for it to show up.   We have never had this issue here in the past.  I'll update my review if I ever return and receive better service and food.   Update- The manager called the next day and offered an apology.  He went out of his way to explain that is not how they do business and wanted to make things right.  Because of this, I am changing from 1 star to 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple
Shawn M.,"Temple, TX",88,102,129,2.0,6/28/2016,"Extremely overpriced food from a place trying to be Cheese Cake Factory.  Service was okay, if a bit on the flamboyant side.   The décor is terrible, like I said they seem to be wanting to look and feel like a Cheesecake Factory and just aren't pulling it off.  The drink prices are ridiculous, with something as simple as a margarita costing almost as much as an entire adult sized entrée.  There are just better more local places to eat at than here.  I would even recommend the Applebees over this place, since the food is about the same quality but it's not as expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple

Kenneth B.,"Harker Heights, TX",9,20,41,2.0,7/8/2017,I was not impressed by my experience at BJ's today. The service was horrendous and the food was not at all what we anticipated it to be. It took forever for the waiter to bring water to the table after requested and the refill on drinks took awhile as well. The beignet tasted more like a fried pancake than a beignet. Was definitely not a good experience and will likely not be revisiting this establishment again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple
Myrna D.,"Temple, TX",0,17,,4.0,4/10/2017,"Great, low-key, relaxing place! Beer is what's offered at BJ restaurants so a variety is on tap. Canned beer and growlers are also available. There is no food cooked on site though a food truck is there at times on Fridays ( I've been told). The lack of food is where that generates the four star rating, otherwise I really like the place.

Aus-Tex B C.,"Austin, TX",19,27,9,1.0,6/23/2016,"C'mon guys, this place has no pride in the quality of food they serve. I ordered my niece a cheeseburger kids meal and clearly told the guy meat, ketchup, cheese, pickles. We sat down to eat and there was no ketchup, no pickles, burnt cheese. Food wouldn't even serve my dog! The smiley potatoes smelled like feet and of course anyone who has kids knows if it's now how they ask for it, good luck getting them to eat it! Ugh! On to the next one. Ordered the broccoli cheese soup bread bowl. The bowl was burnt all the way around and hard as a rock!  Would not recommend this place, at least not the one in Temple, TX. Very disappointed especially from such a large chain.  Have more pride in the food you serve BJ's especially when there's 6 people in the restaurant, guess that should've been a red flag right there.

Our server was a little stretched as it seemed she was serving tables spread across the restaurant.  I had the California club pizza that was  very tasty or maybe I was just really hungry.  ;-)  I did like that it was a deep dish pizza with crust that wasn't under cooked.

Moriah L.,"Temple, TX",0,4,,2.0,2/4/2017,"Sad to say, the quality of the food has really gone downhill in the last year. (Greasy, wrong orders, soggy sandwichs, wrong temperature). Maybe change in management?  I know I never see the original manager checking on customers anymore. I belong to a fairly large meetup group and we go out to eat once a month.  To date, we have always gone to BJ'S. However, due to hour long waits for seating, and being told they no longer book reservations for groups, and the food being hit and miss, we will not be going back. Staff and servers are usually polite but seem overwhelmed at times. Also decor needs help. We brought to one servers attention, since he couldn't find the Mgr, that a picture on the wall over our table was covered in mold or mildew under the glass. Last month,  it is still there.

Melody M.,"Killeen, TX",104,195,1235,2.0,8/17/2014,"I've been here quite a few times and keep hoping that the food gets better.  Has it?  No.  I even tried to order different things in hopes of finding a winner, but I always seem to find myself on the losing end.  This place certainly has the ambiance and promise of good food, but everything I eat here tends to suck.  If you visit their website and look under the ""menu"" tab, you'll see them state, ""And of course, everything tastes better with BJ's own handcrafted beer.""  Maybe that's what I need.. a beer, to drown out their mediocre food.  Well unfortunately, I don't like beer. Our waitress was friendly, but it took a long time for our meal to arrive.  Although no fault of her own, she kept apologizing for the wait.  When my chicken fried steak finally arrived, it was overdone and very tough to chew.  Plus, the mashed potatoes were cold in the middle.  Immediately, I waived down our waitress to complain to which she offered me another one for free, but I was already tired of waiting enough as it is and disappointed; downright hangry. Hey BJ's, I think this is where we part ways.  Unless some friend of mine wants to drag me in here again sometime, I'll just have a cocktail or a Pizookie -- your only saving grace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=20

We place our orders and I decided to set a timer to see how long it took to get our food this time -(last time took forever). We waited - waited and waited. The table behind us that came in 10 minutes after us received their food before we did. When we finally got our food - it took 39 minutes - it was disappointingly cold. So cold that I couldn't even stomach eating my burger. Husbands food was also cold. The server came to check on us and I told her the food arrived cold and that I couldn't eat it and all she said was - ""we can remake it for you or I can offer you a beer"".... Really?  So she comes back with our check and says, I took your fries off your bill for this inconvenience. Um - what about the burger that I didn't eat? Shouldn't that have been taken off? Guess not   Additionally - the whole time we were waiting for our food the wait staff and kitchen workers were being rambunctious to the point where it was unprofessional and distracting. They stood around gossiping and talking instead of - um maybe delivering a hot plate of food to a paying customer. I won't be going back.

Went during work hours on a weekday so it was pretty slow. We got seated and greeted by our waitress immediately. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad. It was amazing! It was perfectly dressed and the Ahi was so delicious! They were kinda stingy with the ahi though. If the salad is 14$..I expect more than a few small bites of ahi.

My daughters grilled chicken was extremely dry, and my sons frenchfries came out 10 minutes after we got our meal.

Hostess broke free from gabfest in back to pretend to care about seating us.  Service started off OK but the food was not made correctly. Hey, it happens. But the dramatic eye rolls were off putting, by other servers not ours. Disagreement among servers over how the sandwich should be prepared, looked like they were covering for each other.  Sandwich gets remade with new hot fries, sandwich dry this time as requested.  So, good marks for the food and flavor. Manager came by and check on meal, actually listened and checked on the remake.

I think next time I would just ask to cook it myself. The service was what I would expect from most chain restaurants but BJ'S always seemed to stand out, guess they gave up or maybe they didn't expect a tip since I was with my family.  I am complete disappointed in them.

Avocado rolls were so good, and the sauce that came with it was pleasantly sweet and complimented the bit of spice in the rolls.  I had their beer battered fish and chips, which was beyond good. I usually don't like fish, but it was perfectly cooked and the batter was absolutely delicious. I got 4 large cod fillets and wedges fries which are seasoned similarly to curly fries.  We sat and talked for a bit after our meal and weren't rushed. This was one my better dining experiences at this B.J.'s and the food was superb.  I've had their pot stickers, mozzarella sticks, pizza, chicken Alfredo and pazookie's in the past. All of it is delicious. What I love about this place, is that you can go on a casual day out or dress up after a more formal event. Their drinks are good, and they often have great specials.

It was really big and I wasn't able to quite fit it in one big bite without stressing my jaws. It had 2 big patties, all your common veggies, onion rings, and the taste was great! It was kind of greasy but when you get a burger with so much stuff on it, you can't expect not to get messy =] It also came with potato wedges.

A year later we went back and the food was delicious! Our server Tim was great. We went back once a week after that and the quality  of the food decreased. Jennifer was our server a few times after that. She was loud and annoying. She always seemed like she was rushing us out. One time she brought out the wrong  food for us and I had to flag another server down and have her fix it. Needless to say her tips from us suffered because of her attitude.

Chris M.,"Austin, TX",4977,535,2556,2.0,1/17/2011,"BJ's is a nice place to go, always a crowd, plenty of TVs, good HH specials.  The food is good - nothing spectacular, but pretty good, and the beer selection is great.  The service is what typically drags this place down - - it's inconsistent and can be spotty at best.   We've been here several times recently, and I'd have to say we have some issues w/ quality of service nearly everytime.  The various issues include:  waiting too long to get your food, waitstaff disappears longer than expected, drinks are not filled, service is reactive instead of proactive , or we're usually waiting for something and then have to put in a request when the waitstaff shows up.   The Managers are usually very nice and professional, they'll walk around and will at times check in with you.  If you escalate to them they are usually very accomodating and eager to please.  That's a great thing, but after the same mistakes happen over and over you just get tired about complaining about the same thing.     A couple of us had the unlimited soup and salad lunch combo.  The 1st round of salads came out in a jiffy, the soup took longer than expected.  They finished the salads, which was then replaced w/ soup, but the waiter never asked if anyone wanted more salad....and he never came back for a while.  After finishing their soups they sat idle for a while - - no one came back to check up.  It wasn't too busy at all, not to mention we had to ask for sugar and silverware initially and never got the sugar, had to take if off another table.  Don't deny us any sugar, pretty please (with sugar on top).  My fish and shrimp tacos were - - okay - - nothing great or exceptional.  The tomato bisque was very good, and my friends loved their caesar salads - - they just wished they could have more of it.  So if BJ's could be more consistent w/ their quality of service - - well - - I'd put them back up at 4 stars easily.   We did, however, enjoy Vanessa's service during one lunch - - she's pretty darn good.  I think next time we'll request her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=60

We ordered the root beer, sampler platter,  Thai chicken mango salad and the ahi poke. We enjoyed eating the ahi poke. The fish was fresh tasting and it is so far the only place so far I know in the area besides C & H that has ahi poke on their menu.  (The ahi poke is better here than at C & H). The price for the ahi poke appetizer is $9.95. The Thai mango chicken salad was priced at $10.95. It was  delicious and fresh tasting as well. They advertise this salad as being less than 575 calories. The ahi poke and the salad is definitely worth coming back for but not the sampler appetizer. The sampler appetizer is priced at $16.95 and it came with avocado egg roll, southwestern spring roll, mozzarella sticks and spinach and artichoke dip. You could find these items at most American restaurants. I was disappointed with the avocado roll. Yelpers recommended this and I am not impressed at all. It is definitely not worth the price so I recommend NOT to get the sampler. The root beer was another recommendation by Yelpers and AGAIN I am not impressed.

We ordered roasted Brussels sprouts which were great. When we ordered our beer I wanted a porter, wife got the Newcastle on tap. She got her beer but I was told the dark beers are too foamy so they aren't selling it. So I have to try again. Got the beer and we ordered. Wife got fish tacos I wanted a ""new "" item, spicy chicken with ""soba"" noodles. The waiter comes back, no spicy chicken cause no noodles. I try again, this time manager comes to apologize for the ""inconveniences"". I order burger with wedge fries, mayo on the side. We also order another round of beers. We finally get the order, they have to go back to get the mayo. My wife was to have chips on her fish tacos per the menu, but when she asked the server argued with her that it didn't. We asked for the menu. When I spread the mayo out of the little cup, there's a worm or something like that in the mayo! NOT good. They go to make another but my wife now wonders what her sauce has in it. Manager reappears. I want my check and out. He wants to make new food. I say no, check and out . He charges for 4 beers.

Well, because I was starving, I wanted an appetizers and got the spinach artichoke dip. It was mediocre. (I have had better...from cheddars) Then i was deciding between the brewhouse double deluxe burger or patty melt. I got the patty melt with the wedge and thin fries (because someone else recommended those). It was good, but something I could get anywhere for cheaper than $10.  Overall, the food and service in general at this chain is good. I didn't get to try any of the beer or other drinks because I had to go back to work, but my friend definitely enjoyed his drinks.

Wait staff seemed tense and rushed, maybe because of the large crowd? Anyways after half way through our meal the waitress chilled out a bit and was more relaxed. We started off with the potato skins covered in cheese and bacon, wasn't much cheese or bacon. I had to scrap up pieces that fell on the plate and put them on my potato wedge to make it worth eating. The flavor itself was good, I just wish they weren't so greedy with the cheese and bacon.  My fiancé ordered the texas style chicken fried steak which she enjoyed. Came with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes , everything seemed fresh and tasty.  I had a small deep dish pizza with Italian sausage , bacon and pepperoni....Delicious! I finished all but two slices. My fiancé only fished a quarter of her CFS. She had a raspberry lemonade? And I had an orange twist which is a mixture of orange cream soda and some other fruity berry juices. Our total bill was $46 which I didn't think was all that bad for the two of us plus we had plenty of left overs and free refills that I took advantage of :) but I wouldn't bring a whole family out to eat here.

I was hoping for smooth creamy mozzarella with yummy tomatoes like the one in San Antonio, but nope. Also, the balsamic reduction was wayyyy too thick. It stuck to the plate like glue, so I couldn't enjoy it. I ordered the Chicken Al La Fresca (the under 575 calories entree) and I was so disappointed. Chicken was flavorless, rice pilaf was so bland it tasted like plain white rice, and there was no arugula on mine, they put spinach on it instead. I didn't even eat it.

Joyce J.,"Temple, TX",1,14,11,2.0,8/15/2010,"I've been to BJ's several times and most experiences have been enjoyable. Food: overpriced and mostly generic.  I've known several people who've gotten the roasted chicken on different occasions and had it come out undercooked (as in raw in the middle). The pizza is mostly just there but always loaded with toppings so it's flavorful.  The parmesan crusted chicken is very good and an entree I would highly recommend.  The pizookies are fabulous, and now they have mini ones! Drink: The mixed drinks are priced higher than I'd like, but the bartenders usually make a good drink.  The beer is more consistent though, and I like that they have flights.  Mostly I recommend their handcrafted root beer which is so, so, so very tasty.  Service: The hostesses and managers are always very nice and greet you as soon as you walk in.  Most of the time, I get a decent waiter.  The bar service is always nice.  Unfortunately, I've always had horrible service with groups larger than 8 people (automatic gratuity added to the bill).  In fact, one waiter even griped at us when 2 people didn't show up so we had 6 instead of 8.  With larger groups, I've found that we're lucky to get the waiter to return for drink refills more than once before the bill comes out.  On more than one occasion with larger groups, I've had to repeat my drink order to the waiter several times, and it would take him two trips to bring it to me.

BJ Restaurant and Brewery reminds me of Gordon Biersch - a corporate brewery.  The restaurant is chic, upscale - for me, personally, not really what I would look for in a brewery/pub.  Bier and food (at least the portions I tasted) were tasty and decent.  However, its still a ""corporate"" restaurant/brewery - I long for the brew pub with distinct taste and character.  Thus, three and not four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=120

Tracey W.,"Richardson, TX",115,131,,3.0,6/19/2011,"This was my first time here.  I have to admit that it took us awhile to get seated, but I think it was because we had a bigger group.  Once we did, the service was lacking.  I ordered a salad with my personal pizza...I finally got the salad when I was halfway done with my pizza.  I'd have much rather had it prior to the pizza.  So that was a definite downside for me.  Then for dessert, they decided we have to have a Pizookie.  They get it ordered...when it's ready, they bring out our 2 and they are the small ones.  We were a group of 8 and they brought us out a smaller Pizookie.  So we had to sit there for another 20-30 minutes while they re-did the entire thing to make it right.  It was very tasty...and one might even say addictive...I might go back, but the bar has been set low for service so I won't expect much and hope they can improve from there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140
Ba L.,"Austin, TX",265,233,243,4.0,3/2/2009,"Party of 39?  We'll take you.  Decent selection of beer?  Got it.   Big variety of food to please a crowd?  Yep.  I came here with a party of 39 after a competition, and it was a decent experience.  The fact that they could seat all 39 of us was pretty nice.  The wait staff didn't managed to keep the orders together though the wait for anything was long.   My dining companion and I ordered 3 beers, 1 pale ale & 2 porters  (4.75 each), along with the large Mediterranean deep dish pizza ($24).  The pale ale was alright.  I'd drink it, but I didn't have any strong feelings about it.  The porter on the other hand, was excellent.  Dark, rich, and chocolaty.  Carbonated with nitrogen, it was smooth and delicious.  This is one of my favorite beers.    The pizza was a pizza.  And it wasn't like a deep dish Chicago pizza; it was just a pizza with really thick crust.  Looking at everyone else's food at the table, it was just typical chain restaurant food.  It's like a Chili's, Applebee's, or Bennigan's (RIP) within a brewery.  Food was satisfying, but not great by any means.  It was also severely overpriced.  $24 for a pizza was a little ridiculous.   In spite of the food and price of food, BJ's gets 4 stars.  They were able to accommodate a large party, though the club meeting was a little difficult due to the noise.  And the Porter was just awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140

Sabrina O.,"Belton, TX",41,34,1,4.0,7/8/2013,"I'm new to the area and BJ's has been my go to restaurant. The first time I went there I got to shrimp scampi. It was delicious, but I added some marinara sauce to it and it tasted even better (I just like to add marinara to everything). We also got the avocado rolls, but I didn't like them. It came with some oily sauce (soy maybe?) and the rolls were greasy. My fiance loved them though. The next time we got spinach and artichoke dip. It was great and it came with a lot of chips which is something many chains don't understand you need to eat dip with. That time we had the bbq chicken pizza. It was awesome, however the deep dish pizza isn't Chicago deep dish. I was kind of thrown off, but it's similar to pizza hut's pan pizza if that helps you understand. Their cookie desserts are AMAZING. And their cocktails are even better. Try the pomegranate sunset (or sunrise whatever its called) and the ""a drink like that."" I like the former better, but both were great fruity drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140
Jay E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4,549,6,4.0,6/19/2011,"A solid chain restaurant without the chain restaurant feel.  It's always busy so not the quickest service but the servers are friendly.  The food is what you'd expect from brewery/pub - great appetizers, a wide variety of entrees, and a plethora of desserts.  We'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140
Jim B.,"Belton, TX",1,26,,2.0,11/2/2012,As a frequent traveler  my expectations are typically set at a very reasonable level.  Having eaten at several other BJ's I was expecting above average service and food quality.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed by both at the Temple store.  I witnessed lackadaisical management and mediocre service and food.  I won't be heading back to this BJ's anytime soon.  The owners should take a hard look at their management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140

Ray K.,"Williamson, TX",0,11,,1.0,11/18/2012,"Ate here for a second time (and last) tonight.  The first time I ate here did not leave much of an impression on me.  It felt like a watering hole and appetizer type place.  My wife and I returned tonight and I left resigned never to return.  We arrived at 5:50 pm.  No wait.  The place was crowded but not full.  At 6:45 I spoke with a manager because we had not seen our food yet.  He came back 10 minutes later with our cold food and explained that the food had been delayed because ""we are very busy"".  I told him that there was not a good excuse to keep us waiting that long.  His response to me was ""OK"", then he promptly left and hid the rest of the time we were there.  I had a pot roast sandwich that was cold and tasteless.  My wife had pork chops that were cold and hard.  All in all, a horrible experience that I will never repeat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140

Megan R.,"Georgetown, TX",1,6,,5.0,1/19/2012,"I went here on my lunch break today.  Usually I don't venture into actual restaurants for lunch but it was payday, and hey, I wanted to treat myself.  And I was treated well.  Let's get down to business: Atmosphere: Very busy, very spacious restaurant.  That said, the only time I had to wait for anything was when I was being sat, which wasn't long.  I like the bar atmosphere quite a bit.  They have tons of tvs and an extensive beer list along with cocktails.  I sat in the dining room this time though. Service: Excellent! My server, Megan, was far and away the best I've had in some time, she sold me on a bunch of great items and knew the menu well.  She was prompt, polite, and courteous.  Very good.  I had a couple managers stop by briefly to ask how I liked everything as well. Food:  The lunch specials are fantastic! I walked in looking to get a sandwich and walked out having had an essentially 4 course meal for under 20 dollars.  They have new items that are ""snacks and bites"" which are pretty much mini appetizers.  I was eating alone, so these were perfect to start off.  I chose the ahi tuna, and it wasn't the paltry serving I was expecting.  It had a good 5-6 pieces of tuna and was accompanied by an asian slaw.  Usually slaws aren't my thing but I liked this one.  For my entree I went for the lunch special half sandwich and salad, specifically the Ty Cobb sandwich.  The salad was out first, and again a nice generous portion.  The sandwich also came with fries (you can choose wedges or thin and crispy. Me=wedges) which was also a nice surprise.  All of it was fresh and delectable.  The best part for me though is always the pizookie, and now they have mini personal ones!  The red velvet is to die for.

Edwin H.,"Austin, TX",4,66,,3.0,2/27/2011,"Cut the menu in half, learn to execute it with consistent recipes served  hot and timely, and your stock will go up.  Keep doing what you're doing and even opening new stores won't save you.  Micro-beer drinkers won't save you when you start moving into urban areas. You're gonna have to get the food right.   Way to many menu items for the kitchen to manage efficiently.  Flying high right now. My prediction is take a look at the stock in two years, if that long.  Also, more comphehensive wait staff training. Obviously, these comments come from our experience of eating there on a number of occasions.  Personally, I love the meatloaf, my wife hates it. More people will hate it than not, it has no ""middle of the road"" appeal. You either love it or hate it, no in-between.  Chains MUST learn to please the moderate ""taste buds"" in both directions!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=140

Liesse B.,"Temple, TX",68,15,,3.0,5/2/2011,"My husband and I have been to BJ's a handful of times (since it's one of the only restaurants in Temple slightly better than Applebee's/Chilis).  The ONLY reason we come back is because the food is good and the beer is better. We have never had any issues with the food here.  We have enjoyed everything we've ordered.  I love the beers and the root beer isn't the best I've ever had but it's darn close.  Seriously, we only come back to this place for the food... Every time I've been in BJ's in Temple the service has been less than desirable.  Seeing as my husband and I waited tables through college, we're pretty understanding of the biz.  The first time we visited, our waitress was in a bad mood and it was very obvious.  The second time our waitress was nice, but a complete ditz.  I think the worst experience we had was when we took my  parents and children to BJ's for Sunday late lunch (around 1:30 p.m.).  The restaurant was less than half-full, and it took us an hour to get our food.  The kids were cranky and restless, and there were no apologies or much of an effort to keep us slightly happy, and we could barely catch our waiter to get our drinks refilled once we received them a half hour after ordering them.  The table next to us (with 6 adults) managed to get their drinks and food in under a half hour and when we questioned about it, the waiter just said, ""That's how it goes sometimes.""   I'm happy to see they've got a gluten-free menu, and the only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 2 is because I find myself constantly daydreaming about Pizookies and beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temple?start=160
