She is always open to chew the fat with us. Olive Christy, but ingest she does enjoy a bit of ribbing. You butter believe that we will be going back to Friday's. If you don't enjoy Friday's then you doughnut belong there.

Eric S.,"Simi Valley, CA",7,59,1,1.0,9/6/2017,"Unconscionably bad wait staff service, and inedible food.   In our recent visit, the waitress never once came over for fifteen full minutes at which time we had to go find the hostess to eek out some service. When she did finally arrive, it took us awhile to realize she wasn't being rude because she was drunk, which it seemed, but because she was Russian or Latvian and barely spoke English. The burger had some kind of awful fake cheese sauce which tasted like vomit. This place needs to be bulldozed.  Don't eat here.  (Or any Friday's.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley

Service was fine, nothing spectacular. Server was friendly but not super attentive. Ribs looked really good and were super tasty! Sandwich was meh. Don't expect lots of shrimp and those that were cooked well had charcoal burns on them. Naan was good as was yogurt dip.

Brittany S.,"Middletown, NY",164,86,28,5.0,6/18/2017,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place. We came here on a Friday night and I was doubtful/didn't think it would be very good, but it was surprisingly really lively in the bar/outdoor area. We sat in the outdoor area which had tables and a couch/fireplace area right outside the bar.  Our service was REALLY good, our waitress was super sweet and always checking up on us (I forget her name but she had a long, blonde ponytail).  The drinks were bomb, I got a mango berry blended margarita that basically tasted like a really good icee but still had a good amount of alcohol in it. I also had like 3 of the spicy cucumber mojito drinks which were really good too! The appetizers were also really good, we split the appetizer platter, pretzel plate and spinach dip which were all suuuuuper good  I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to go out local on a Friday night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley

The Hostess at 2pm today refused service and to be seated because I had a Starbucks Frappuccino in my hand and even though I would not drink from it, they told me I would have to throw it away to serve me. I have been to many a TGI Friday's and brought in drinks and this has never been an issue.  The funny thing is a man worker was going to seat us without any issue. However, it worked good for us because we went to Chili's and had excellent service and an excellent meal and I got to spoil my server with a big fat tip for this Holiday Season.

Lianne K.,"Simi Valley, CA",184,770,4337,2.0,8/1/2016,"First time back at this Friday's in many years.  Slow and indifferent service started the downhill slide.  Apparently our server had too many tables, or else just wasn't on her game. We waited to have our drink order taken, then my ""Cherry Limeade Freeze"" wasn't frozen, and was so cloying sweet that I needed to majorly water it down in order to drink it.  I mentioned this to the server when I asked for the glass of water.  She actually shrugged and said, ""Yeah"".  What?!  Not, ""I'm so sorry, would you care for something else?"" There went two stars right there. Sheesh.  We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu.  We all dug into the mozzarella marinara appetizer.  Adored Grandson and I shared the Bruschetta Chicken, which was savory and had great texture. Unfortunately, our entrees took a long time to come out, which meant the dish wasn't very warm, and the chicken was on the chewy side, not that tender. Dear Hubby ordered the Jack Daniels chicken meal, which came with two sides.  The spinach looked like it had dried out and died on the plate, sadly. I truly feel our server's inability to keep our meal moving, and also inability to check in at appropriate times to let us know where we were in the process had a large part in downgrading our experience.  I didn't feel that she was rude, just clueless about how to properly serve guests. We did try their strawberry shortcake dessert.  Meh.  It was a sundae, not a shortcake.  There was one small slice of what looked like Pepperidge Farms butter cake stuck into a pile of ice cream, with a few pitiful strawberries buried under the ice cream.  The conception of that dish needs to be revisited.  It was the least appetizing strawberry shortcake I've ever had, ever.

I could have gone to Carl's and had a better burger for half the price! My wife had a Cobb salad. It hardly had anything on it! More lettuce and few other ingredients. We have had better Cobb salads at Denny's and Coco's for less money. I issued a complaint to their website and got the usual canned response failing to offer anything in return. We went there with a buy one, get one free coupon if you buy 2 drinks. After tip and tax it was $26. Imagine if we paid full price for this fiasco??!!

They just remodeled so the bar area has more room and the patio has a new seating/lounge area. We sat on the patio and although it's winter, we live in Cali so of course, the sun was shining. It was nice to sit outside but there were no umbrellas at all so it made sitting out there for too long a little unpleasant.

Rochelle M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,14,,4.0,10/7/2014,"I've probably been here a couple hundred times by now, not including the brief 4 months that I worked here almost 10 years ago.  I think Renee said it best - ""I don't expect much and I'm never disappointed."" This is TGIF, not a fancy steak house.  I am usually only here for happy hour (though I'm sad they've recently raised their happy hours prices). I still think the half-price appetizers are awesome, and there's a lot of drinks in the $4-$6 range. I don't know if I'd pay full price for anything I've had, but it's a great deal on happy hour. I love the Spinach Florentine Flatbread and the pretzel with beer cheese. $1.50 sliders and basket of fries aren't a bad deal, either. Service is sometimes hit or miss, but I've yet to have anyone totally horrible. Sometimes it takes a while to get food/drinks, but that's because it's 10:30 on a Friday night and it's BUSY. Not the server's fault. Expect slower service on a busy weekend night. I've had a lot of really great servers. The manager seems to care, also. One time the manager approached our table and gave us coupons for free appetizers because we had to wait so long for our drinks..... we hadn't even complained!

Laura Marie D.,"Simi Valley, CA",182,17,1,1.0,12/1/2017,The worst experience  ever at this restaurant this evening . It started off with not being seated for nearly 40 minutes after our reservation time. At which point when we finally did get seated we waited nearly another 20 minutes to have our food order taken when are original waitress went on break a another waiter took over I accidentally spilled a tray of drinks on my friend. Which would have been overlooked if the service was good he apologized and handled it in a professional manner however when the original Raiders came back on she verbally insulted him in conversation with a couple of people at our table which I thought was very unprofessional of her. The manager never came to the table to the very end of the stay when I told him they did not tend to our table in a proper manner nobody cleared off the old drink cups or the dishes when we were done he apologized but never sent anyone over to clear the table so basically we sat there with all of our dirty dishes and extra drink cups throughout the whole time normally we can Overlook these sort of things if the restaurant is super busy but it wasn't the service at this restaurant is horrible this isn't the first time this sort of thing happens you need to really tighten up on your crew and teach them the ins and out of being a server. you clear the table as often as needed.

We were in the mood for a cold beer, good appetizer, and a tasty dinner.  We first ordered a beer each and the nachos grande. They were very good!! Two kinds of cheese, grilled chicken, jalapeños, pico de gallo, and sour cream and guacamole on the side. Yum!!  My fiancé got a build your own burger and they forgot 1 of his 2 toppings. Then it took forever to get ahold of our waitress to ask her for it.  Want another beer? Forget it, you're never going to able to flag someone down. I ordered the sizzling chicken & spinach. It sounded great on the menu! Miso glazed grilled chicken served with spinach, kale, red onions, and mushrooms and a side cold salad of tomatoes, basil, and fresh mozzarella. The dish arrived and I was very disappointed. Tiny, dry, teriyaki chosen breast with over-steamed spinach, 3 tiny slices of mushroom, and a couple slivers of red onion. Missing the kale and the entire entree didn't even cover 1/3 of the sizzling plate. (Check photo) The cold side tomato mozzarella salad dish was on the sizzling plate.

Then they tell me that the item I ordered was not available... only after another 25 min of waiting did they bring this up to me.  The second time I came here was just a few nights ago. We came for dinner and we sat in the booth by the bar area. Inside was just sticky, messy, and filthy. Not a single person came by to check up on us or ask for our drinks and order. We waited a very, very long time...so, we finally decided to just get up and leave.

Luckily the woman waitress gave us a pitcher of water and took the next two of our orders for the endless apps.

The service was great on a Monday evening and the food came out quickly. The mozzarella sticks were delicious.  The chicken and shrimp pasta was tasty and full of flavor. It was a perfect portion size  (not too much or too little). We would gladly order this again. The Jack Daniel's Chicken and Shrimp was good.  This choice comes with two sides of your choosing.

The good:   TV's are labeled when you walk in as what games will be on them and you can sit accordingly.  I think that's a great idea and it worked out very well for my friend and I who wanted to watch different games.   They have bottomless mimosas for 10 bucks! The bartenders were awesome and the service was quick and friendly.  I rarely had to ask for a refill and if I did, it was done immediately.  Kudos to the staff on a busy day. The bad: It's Friday's so I know going in that the food is going to be awful.  And since I wasn't expecting anything to be very good, I wasn't disappointed.  But things like bacon looking like the crap you see at the cheapest buffets in Vegas?  C'mon.  Show just a little culinary pride, Friday's.  As usual, everything was over-salted and greasy so just expect it to be bad and you won't be let down. The bottomless mimosas are great but you can't tweak it to your liking.  They make it 60-40 OJ to champagne.  For me, that's WAY too much OJ.  And they will not budge on this.  I get that it keeps you from drinking too much but I find that to be a really crappy practice.  You'll let me modify ANYTHING else but this?  I'll be passing on it in the future. All in all, if you like to watch all the games, this is a great place to go.  If you're looking for good food, this isn't it.  If you like morning mimosas with mostly OJ setting off your acid reflux, this will work out well for you.  For me, I'm done and won't be back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=40

Katie M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/12/2017,"I come to Fridays mostly when I'm just looking for a casual gathering place with a few friends. I always enjoy the food, and their Georgia Peach cocktail is the only alcoholic beverage (at any establishment) that I order for the taste. Mostly low-key, friendly staff. They're not always the most diligent, but they're not overbearing, which is mostly what I care about.  My one bad experience happened the last time i was there, and I admit, i havent been back since, for fear a repeat. Our waitress only ever stopped by our table if she happened to be passing by on her way somewhere else. We felt rushed when ordering, and any questions were usually met with unnecessarily snippy answers. A different waitress delivered our food, and was the only one to notice that we had not yet received any tableware. Our waitress only fully reappeared when she delivered our bill, on which I noticed she had charged me for 2 drinks, one of which I ordered ($8), and the other was a similar, but more expensive drink ($9.50). We waited a long time to be able to flag her back around just so I could ask her to remove the extra charge, and when she finally got the new bill to us, she had removed the drink I actually recieved, and kept the charge for the more expensive one. I didn't want to spend even more time to get the extra $1.50, so we just put cash in the little book and waited for the final reciept and change, which the waitress never brought back. Finally, after our meal was done for quite some time now, and we had obviously just been waiting here, she stopped by just to let us know that her shift was over and she was leaving. I asked her then for the payment reciept, which she tried to tell me she'd already given us, which we all new was BS, because we were never given our change, either. So, as far as I can tell, this girl just assumed that whatever was left over from our cash payment was hers to keep, and never even bothered to bring the reciept, which, frankly, I find just rude and presumptuous. I almost wish now that I had just let her keep the change, rather than leaving her an actual (bigger) tip.  That's my rant. Over all, Fridays is great if you don't want a particularly fancy meal out.

Cajun chicken shrimp pasta:  huge plate! Much bigger thab expected.  It was pretty good, I liked it.  They were not stingy with the pieces of chicken but there was only probably like 4 shrimps in the entire pasta :/  it was not too salty and the alfredo sauce with cajun spice was good.  I would get it again Only downside of sitting outside is all the smokers.  I was overwhlemed with the smell of cigarette smoke while eating.  They should probably designate a smoking section instead to accommodate to their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=60

Michael F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,1.0,1/21/2017,"..........and this is proof they don't give a flying Fuss about customer service: Not one Manager, General Manager, Regional Manager, or anyone associated with this the business has enough interest in the business they work for to respond to a legitimate complaint. Gee whizikers.  Thank you Jason S. for responding. I accept any sincere apology, but as someone in management myself, I think apologies are of little value without going the 'extra mile' and doing something proactive in resolving the issue. Is this an actual law? If not, was the waitress misinformed or trained incorrectly? Was anything done as far as communicating to staff that this was a proper or improper way to treat customers? Perhaps this waitress had a horrible day? Should I try your business again with the assuredness that this will not happen again?  Michael Jason S.  The service at the restaurant is poor (look at the Yelp ratings). The service you give in response is even worse. It is YOUR job or someone else that works for the company to do what you suggested I do. The customer was already 'put-out' by Bad service. It is not for me to spend even more time speaking with the manager AND Customer Relations. Let me speak frankly to you. The very essence of customer service is to do the opposite of what is natural to us; be lazy. It would not Be lazy if it were you who took the next Step and spoke to the Manager or the DM or GM and ask them what the law is. Ask them what you can do to help this restaurant's Yelp rating. Ask them what You can do to satisfy a customer. Or, figure it out for yourself. But, never ask a customer to do the work for you. Remember. The essence of customer service is to not be lazy. You are working for me, I am not working for you. If one doesn't like their job, that is when they become lazy, that is when they ask inappropriate people to do a job that is not their task.

Normally when we have a friend join that's in a wheelchair that he can not get out of and is larger they will allow us to make a reservation. I just called and the hostess just told me they wouldn't make a reservation because all the tables are wheelchair accessible. Anyone who has went there clearly knows ALL tables are NOT wheelchair accessible. They normally put us in the last table close the the bathroom so the wheelchair can roll right in and doesn't block anyone.

Amusingly, a couple of women who had been there before us left as we sat down, scoffing and shaking their heads. I believe their exact words were, ""Good luck, we've been waiting a half hour."" Yikes.  My friend works in food service, so I took him at his word that it was alright to pop in and ask for a server. We shouldn't have had to do that, but we got the desired response. The time between ordering and receiving our food was actually frighteningly fast; salads don't take much effort, but my friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich. I don't know what to make of that, but I guess it was alright. The rest of the time, our server was scarce to be seen.  I ordered my salad with the vinaigrette and without the extra chipotle-whatever they would have put on it. Fortunately, it lacked the latter, and unfortunately, it also lacked the former. Boo!

The Wife and I came here for Sunday lunch to the nice discovery that all day Sunday is happy hour at the bar AND in the restaurant proper. Half off all appetizers means you can actually get a real lunch for cheap. Wife had the Jack Daniel's oriental chicken plate thing (I apologize I can not remember the name), and a side of fries ($1.50 during happy hour). I had the Jack Daniel's Burger, but upon reflection, I could have gotten the sliders, a side of JD sauce and order of fries, and we probably would have made it out of the restaurant under $15 and no less satisfied. Our waitress was nice and friendly, but didn't seem to know the workings of the TGI Stripes club thing, and after all was said and done, didn't take our stripes number either, despite having talked about it at length.

Darian W.,"Simi Valley, CA",18,23,,3.0,8/12/2013,"This site needs a 2 1/2 start rating, or 3 out of 6 because this place is very middle of the road. Let's have the pros: They have a lively bar crowd and if that's what you have in mind, you've found it. The drinks are fancy, come in wide variety and are definitely plentiful. Most of the appetizers are pretty tasty, my favorite being the pretzel bread sticks with melted beer cheese (don't judge, just try it). They also serve a nice vanilla bean cheesecake and super sweet strawberry shortcake that is sure to please any sweet tooth. Lastly, the service has always been great. The energetic, young wait staff are always helpful. It also doesn't hurt that this is one of the very few places open late (other than Denny's) in this whole dang town. The cons: The dinners they serve here just aren't worth what you pay. They are on the high end of moderately priced and there just isn't anything great about them. The dishes tend to either be way over seasoned or tasteless. I'm not sure why they bother other than the fact that all that booze streaming out of the bar shouldn't be consumed on an empty stomach. Plus, every time I've tried to order a steak here (which they tout as one of their specialties) it comes out consistently ill prepared. I feel sorry for the waiters because I've had to send them back so often. Most items, be it drinks or food are highly over priced but with the dinners I have to draw the line because they don't make it worth my while in flavor. Lastly, if you're not planning to get drunk the atmosphere Thur, Fri and Sat nights is obnoxious, so choose your timing wisely. Useful info: Typical of other locations in this chain, has private large lot, park away from main building at night to avoid drunk idiots, open until 1am but kitchen may close a bit earlier if business is slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=120

I don't usually patron TGIF's due to less than average experience but figured it was a good choice for a quick lunch.  We walked in and there was nobody there to greet us.  The podium was all by itself so we casually walked in to the bar area and seated ourselves.  Only then did we attract some attention and menus were brought to us. The waitress that took our drink and food orders was very nice and attentive.  She got our drinks promptly and notified us when to expect our food, which arrived some 15 minutes after ordering.  I had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich with fries.  While the chicken itself was okay, it was soaked in excessive buffalo wing sauce.  Way too much for my taste; it totally overpowered everything in the sandwich including the chicken.  The bread was also soaked with sauce.  I ate what I could after scraping most of the sauce off with my knife.  The fries that came with the sandwich were soggy.

We decided to have a nice steak dinner on the patio and decided to go to Fridays.  What could go wrong?  First the patio is completely full of douchebags shouting and comparing tattoos.  It's very noisy - on a Sunday night no less.  Second the live entertainment was just annoying.  Third, TGI Fridays permits smoking on the patio, so forget about breathing fresh air while dining.  Fourth, both of our steaks were overcooked, thin and tough.  We could barely cut it - much less chew it.  Fifth, I ordered my steak rare and it arrived well done.  Sixth, my steak was supposed to be served with Alfredo sauce.  Instead it arrived with marinara sauce.  Note to the chef - Alfredo is white - marinara is red...  Seventh, the bill for this horrendous dining experience was a whopping $21 per plate!   The bottom line is, if you're a noisy drunken tool who likes smoking while eating, lots of noise, and has money to burn for thin, overcooked steaks with the wrong sauce - then TGI Fridays is definitely for you.  For the rest of us, there are places with much better food & service who charge half as much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=120

But they did nothing.  When I spoke to the manager all he could say was ""I'm sorry, I can get you seated now, but you won't get your order for about an hour"".   Interestingly, their excuse was that they were hit with a lot of orders because of the Renaissance Faire ending and people coming in to eat, but there were actually a lot of empty tables.  I have been in this restaurant when it was busier and didn't have to wait that long. Poor scheduling on their part for sure!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=100

Olivia C.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,19,,3.0,3/15/2015,Last night my husband and I went after work. We were greeted by the hostess who was super friendly and proceeded to go to the bar. The hostess quickly came and gave us our menus and our waiter soon came to take our order. I was very please with our waiter because he was really nice and attentive. As my husband and I proceed to look at the menu the prices seemed way to high which last time I went it wasn't  that pricey. When we got our food the I was pleased with the jack Daniels chicken strip and the Tuscan spinach dip. When I looked over at my buffalo wings I was disappointed  cuz not all my wings had sauce. It just lacked presentation. Since I was super hungry I just kinda said whatever and proceeded to eat. We later ordered the Tennessee whiskey cake and we asked for our check..when we look at it we were shocked that all of what we ordered was a little over 60 bucks and including tip left our bill at 70 dollars... Over all we just feel they should have more presentation with their plates and maybe not be so pricey but our experience was great and very relaxing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=100

I asked the waitress if this was a gluten-free bun she told me it was with a smile. it is 12 hours later and I am so sick because it was not. If you have celiac or gluten intolerance eat here at your own risk. The staff definitely needs better training. This is not to say that they were not courteous and friendly. The atmosphere was great.

So some guy brings my friend his order and we get two more beers. That was it. Not one waiter or waitress returned to see if we needed anything.

We have been here a handful of times during the day, food was always good but the service has been so-so. But this past Saturday was the first time we went after 10 and the 1/2 off appetizers were a nice surprise, the mozzarella sticks were sooooooo good, perfectly melty and crunchy. The lemon drop and chocolate martini (which I know is a pain to make) were great, delicious and I could taste the vodka. The drinks somewhat makes up for the fact that the bartender that night did not seem very friendly. He was attentive enough but 'just' enough to keep me happy.

Bryce W.,"Simi Valley, CA",80,220,2,1.0,9/22/2014,"We recently spent the evening at Friday's for a fundraiser. This is something we do almost monthly at various establishments that are kind enough to offer to host. We generally draw a fantastic turnout. The latest one was no different. Unfortunately, the restaurant was unprepared. We sat in the bar area for the happy hour menu. My wife and I spend a lot of time volunteering, so we wanted to enjoy the evening with reasonably priced beers and appetizers accompanied by our close friends. We got there about 5:30 on a Tuesday with the bar area about half full. There was on server assigned to the bar. Apparently, the restaurant thought one server in the bar area was sufficient and, quickly, the bar was packed.  I'm just going to break down the night into different aspects of the experience rather than writing out the three hour experience. The service: Our first round of drinks came with light heady pours. It is what it is. A bad pour is based on the bartender, but it's always a little disappointing. We moved on. With one server in the bar area though, we had a lot of down time where he didn't come to see us. Multiple times we had to stop him to ask to order food or drinks and usually that was met with an impatient sigh if not downright rude comments. When new people joined us, he never came to take their order. When we ordered food, it took up to an hour to receive it. Our friends ordered the potato skins appetizer. It took an hour to come and when it did, the plate was hot to the touch from sitting under the heat lamp so long. Inconsistent pours, delays in both ordering and receiving what we wanted, and his surliness left a bad impression. By the end of the night, the manager had to personally bring us items we'd ordered because the server had either never put them in or forgotten to bring them out. He even had to clear our beer glasses after I had started stacking them in the center of the table to make room for food that never came. The Bill: After our first round the server asked if we were all on one bill, we replied no and told him who ordered what so he could start separate bills. While he wrote something down, he apparently never actually separated the bills. At the end of the night, we received one bill and he explained that with everyone ordering, he just couldn't keep track. Incompetence is not an excuse. We were all reasonable and would have given him the time necessary to track tabs or even split the bill ourselves at the end of the night if he had been upgront with us and said he couldn't manage splitting it with such a large group.  The end of the night, though, came long after we were ready to leave. It took an hour to get our bill. When we did get it, there were countless items that were wrong. I had to send back the bill three times because items we didn't order were on the bill and prices were wrong. The appetizers that took 45 minutes to come out?Oh, that was apparently because he forgot to put them in as evidenced by the non happy hour pricing. The process of actually paying the bill took so long we had to order another round of drinks for the wait. If it wasn't a fundraiser, this would have been the first time I ever left without paying a bill.  The manager: He was very nice, but by the time he tried to intervene, it was too late. He should have been bussing tables and bringing out food earlier. He should have called in a server who had the night off. He should have expected a better turnout from the beginning. He gave us free appetizer coupons and offered to increase staff if we returned, but why would we? It went beyond ""lack of staff"" to ""rude and incompetent staff"".  The product: Was fine when it came on time, but why order endless wings if he never asks if you want a refill and never brings them when you order them? Beer levels were wildly inconsistent. Sometimes the glass was full, sometimes the beer stopped two inches from the top. I can't really complain about the quality I guess. It was as expected. Overall, this was a really disappointing night. After three hours, I ended up donating $10 to our organization. Of course, I could have donated that directly and not had to deal with the irritation of our friends who were there to support our organization. Fridays performed so poorly that it reflected bad on our non profit. That's very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=100
Joana L.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",47,80,115,3.0,2/19/2015,Unfortunately I have to agree with the negative reviews regarding the service. We came in on a Wednesday around lunch time we were seated immediately (it was practically empty) the waitress took or drink order and came back in less than two minutes so far so good right?. Right it took her twenty minutes to come back and take our order when she finally did it took close to 35 minutes for her to bring it out now am not blaming her for the cook taking his time in making our food but she never even came by to see how we were doing. The one and only time she did she was walking by with someone else's order in her hand and didn't even stop at our table just kinda mumbled it as she walked by.  We both ordered the sizzling chicken and mashed potatoes which was delicious however the bad and slow service was the deal breaker. When it was time to leave and I finally caught her to ask her for the check it took her forever to bring it. When I was ready to pay she never came back so I decided to pay in the tablets thingies they have  on the tables. I probably won't come back to this location and defiantly don't recommend you come in if you are on a lunch break I guarantee you will be late clocking back into work.

I myself am a server, so I know what it's like. We came in @12:30am. Online it said they were open till 2am, but apparently it was wrong. They actually close @1am but we didn't find that out till we were already there. We decided to stay. Our server (I believe her name was Pj) told us that we had to order fast because the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. Excuse me? I'm a paying customer... I could come in @12:59am, you have to serve me. She didn't come to check up on us once. She only came to take the order and to drop off the check. She didn't refill our drinks, she didn't see if we needed anything extra, she didn't make sure the food came out okay... Nothing. Also she made us order dessert with our meal because the ""kitchen"" was closing. Who wants to eat dessert with dinner? I decided to speak to the manager & he was also very rude (I'm unsure of his name) he also said the kitchen was closed. I thought he was rude and provided us with bad service. He didn't apologize for the bad service or anything. We finally figured it what our server was doing the whole time. She was too busy in the bar with he friends hanging out.....

Billy D.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,38,,1.0,3/4/2013,"Only gave a (1) star because that's the lowest.  This place is absolutely HORRIBLE!  Management should be embarrassed.  I hope Corporate reads these so they shut this place down.  I travel a lot and I can say most TGIF's have gone way down hill over the years, but this one in Simi is disgusting. The service is pathetic and the food is not meant for human consumption.  They don't make anything fresh.  It's all prepared.  The lettuce is wilted and dirty, the chicken tenders are tiny and taste like rubber (most likely microwaved), the fries are way undercooked, the cheese sticks are thawed out and served at room temperature, the steak is like cardboard.  The service is basically non-existent.  You have to ask for things multiple times and you're lucky if you get place setting within five minutes after getting your meal.  Forget free refills because unless you're there for two hours you're not getting a refill.  The servers make you feel like you did something wrong when you order or when you ask for anything.  Obviously a sign of how unhappy they are with their management.   I don't go to this one much.  In fact, I don't go to any of them much.  But this one is empty every time I walk in.  It's kids eat free on Monday and at 7:30 the restaurant is at about 25% capacity.

I go here often.    The reason why they don't get 5 stars is for the staff. Every time I am there it is a 2-3 hour ordeal. Their service is soooooooo slow. If you walk in and sit at the bar during happy hour, nobody will come and approach you for a long time, and they act like you're a burden when they finally do show up. It takes forever to get the check and forever to get it back. I come here all the time but I won't come here if I don't have at least 2 hours to spare because that's the minimum time it takes to get in, eat, and get out.   The environment here on a friday night is what you would expect. It is a young adult crowd that can get kind of rowdy and loud. Lots of girls do drugs in the bathroom. Typical friday!

We are Asians, we are Filipinos and we never thought that this will be a reason for us not to get equal treatment in a well known place like this.  On our 45th minute of wait another group of four white kids came in and in less than 10 minutes the receptionist led them to a table.  We know for a fact that they were not listed because they themselves were even talking about what they need to do to get a table, meaning they don't know they have to be listed first. So my friend went to ask the receptionist that had the waiting list, asking why these people got a table first when we were there ahead of them and that we have been waiting for almost an hour. The receptionist first asked the name we gave them on the list and when we told her she looks at the list and said she has been calling us but we never came. Like really? How can we not mind a call from her when she was less than 5 feet away from us and we were attentive to their calls because, HELLO!! We were already hungry!! Then instead of apologizing first for having us wait for an hour, she tells us the other 4 white kids called in, from there we were done with Friday's. We felt wronged, we felt discriminated and it was very embarrassing, this place should be shut down if not fire those racist staff of theirs. We had asked for the manager but we were just too damn tired & hungry we just left and head to the nearest Elephant Bar ( which was way better, good food, good ambiance & great people ).   So if you don't want to be discriminated because of your color please do not go to this location. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=180

The ""coleslaw"" was simply cabbage, no dressing could be tasted on it. I also had dried up, dead onion rings. Waitress ignored refilling my coffee. I thought lunch would be cheaper, so I went to lunch one day. I had a dry bun with dry pulled pork in it. It was supposed to be in barbecue sauce. I had a side included, wasn't exciting. I cannot remember what I even picked. Waitress ignored refilling my coffee. 3rd try. I wanted steak and lobster for my birthday. I got a tiny steak again, 6 ounces. I got a 4 oz lobster tail. Most of the ounces must have been the shell it was stood up inside of. Two small bites, lobster gone. A HUGE BAKED POTATOE, the biggest one I ever got in a restaurant. I figure something had to fill up space on the plate!   It came WITH NO BUTTER, A teeny  DAB OF SOUR CREAM, AND NO ONIONS. I HAD SAID YES TO ALL 3 THINGS TO BE ON IT! I eventually saw the waitress, asked for butter, got a dab. I poured the tiny container of lobster butter on it, still not enough.  The onion rings were delicious, sweet onions, moist enough!

For out last visit starting at 7 PM Friday night, went there for a B-Day dinner with a group of about 20. Now, to be fair, I would expect things to go a bit slower when your dealing with a larger party, but 3 hours start to finish? The waitress, who was very pleasant the whole evening, was woefully under trained or under experience to deal with a large party with split checks.  It took over 30 mins to straighten out the checks. There seemed to be no urgency in her actions to get things settled. Other then that, the food was decent, but staggered over 30 mins or so. Meaning people that ordered at the same time did not receive their meals at the same time. And the Long Island Iced Tea was the WORST I have ever had, was nasty. Something was out of sync with that drink! Had to send it back. Replaced it with the Fuzzy peach, iced tea, lemonade cooler. The name from the menu may be different, I don't recall the exact name of the drink, but it was mediocre at best. Tasted very watered down, very difficult to pick out any flavors in that one. I usually have 2 drinks with dinner, but not with that crap coming out of the bar that night.  And my previous visit several days earlier, for food only, had issues with the server. Quite surely, and slow to take care of the table. We arrived to the table and there was no silverware or napkins. No worries I think, as long as they come before food hits the table. Well that didn't happen. When the appetizers came, no napkins or silverware. We had to flag down the server and asked when we might get some, and her response was, ""don't worry, we wont make you eat your diner with your hands"". How about some napkins while we eat our finger foods? How about if someone din't want to use their hands to eat the greasy, buy good tasting appetizers? Server was lucky I was there, because the wife was not amused and would have stiffed her for a tip, thats how much she cared for the crummy service.  In the past I have had diner there and the food is usually decent. And you cant beat the 2 for $20 deal! It just seems the quality of staff is not up to par.

Always used to have good food and good service. Things went wrong as soon as we walked in. They were not busy. We were greeted by a sour faced server who took us to a table. We politely asked if we could wait for a booth, and you would have thought we had asked for the moon. She stood there expecting us to sit at the table and ignored our request. We repeated it, and she stomped off while we waited. We should have walked out there and then. We finally got seated and waited & waited for our server. When she came she was pleasant and polite. This is the only reason i have given 2 stars & not 1!  We sat there a long while before we got any drinks. Then we waited & waited for our food. At one point when the server did appear again, i caught her eye and she rushed off to the kitchen. I don't know whether they were short staffed in the kitchen that day or were just slow, but i dread to think what would have happened if they were busy! When we finally got the food it was nice & hot, but such a small amount! Funnily enough, a friend of our server came in after us, and got his food super quick, & our server spent the rest of the time we were in there, talking to him! On a good note, we were sat in the right hand side booths. Over the left hand side is a huge, very long row boat, that was thick with dust. Not very hygienic sitting under that, eating!! I cannot tell you how disappointed we were. Our rare trip to eat out was ruined. We felt angry and frustrated & it ruined our day. We remembered this restaurant as a fun, good value place to eat a few years ago. Such a shame it's gone downhill so much.

Roger P.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/13/2013,"My wife and I went in on a weeknight about 5:45 pm. Got seated quickly. Server was prompt. Brought drinks pretty fast. Then we ordered the food. I had the Jack Daniels Chicken and Shrimp dinner. When it came there were 6 pieces of shrimp about the size of a 50 cent piece. The breast of chicken was only 1/4"" thick and way over-done. The baked potato was  medium size and tasty. My wife's meal was the flat iron steak. She ordered it well done and it was, but again the size was pretty small... even for 8 oz.

Sun C.,"Simi Valley, CA",22,42,4,2.0,5/19/2010,"When we first moved into Simi, we dined at this TGIF every month.  Back then, the food was decent enough, although we made sure to stick to the tried-and-true dishes (i.e. chicken fingers, fajitas, Jack Daniel stuff and  anything fried), because when they tried to be fancy (Asian-style dishes and ""gourmet"" pastas) they fell flat.   However, starting around maybe around 2007, their food quality started going down.  I remember they introduced a dish of braised pork shank sitting on top of mashed potatoes and had crispy onion rings sprinkled around it.  It was delicious!  But then I noticed after several months how they started cost-cutting: the onion rings became less, the pork shank became smaller... then eventually they took it off the menu altogether. But the one constant thing that made us always want to come back was their French Onion soup.  It was truly delicious, and we thought that it could stand up to the ones we've had at a French bistro in SF Valley.  Plus the serving amount in the bowl (not cup!) was just the right size for us. Fast forward to around 2008.  For some reason we did not visit TGIF for months and, upon our return, promptly ordered the French Onion soup in a bowl.  We were dismayed at what we got.  Everything about the portion was smaller than before: less cheese on top (which used to melt over the bowl and that my kids loved to pick at) and much less soup underneath.  Plus the flavor wasn't the same: gone was the rich and flavorful broth.  Sure, maybe the price didn't change, but I guess the way they made up for the cost was to serve you a soup that was the shadow of the its former self.  And so we had our last disillusionment and have no desire to return.   We go to a restaurant to enjoy good food, or at the very least, decent food.  Unfortunately, TGIF cannot provide that anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=160

The waitress took half an hour to even talk to us after giving us our sticky menus.  As for the food, it was mediocre, can't really say it was horrible or really fresh and yummy.  I had the ribs there and they were so-so.  I guess the service was so frustrating, I don't think anything would of tasted delicious at this point.  After seeing other's horrible review of this place I decided to confirm that this place is definitely a dump.  If I want Friday's I guess I'll just go to the one in Woodland Hills or Porter Ranch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=160
Caitlin C.,"Nashville, TN",152,641,437,3.0,11/10/2009,"HA, I love all these angry people!!!! I've never been to a TGI Fridays, and it just so happened I eaten anything but a bowl of fruit loops all day, so when my BF and I saw TGI Fridays first we parked, and that was that. On a Monday night, we were seated instantly. In fact the service the rest of the night was just as fast, our waitress was on top of it. The place is completely un-authentic in the Disneyland sort of way...you're meant to think you're in like a fantasy land cool bar setting, and it's totally bogus. At least we could see the Broncos and the Steelers on all the darn TVs from any angle.  I'm giving this place 2.5 stars, mostly because the food was just okay, but I've had better. You know TGI is in that generic chain restaurant genre, along with Applebees, and what's that other one, Chilis. It's not that the food is bad, its just bland, lacks excitement on any level. I got this sizzling chicken breast thing, that comes with shrimp, onions and bell peppers, plus the best tasting part of my meal, two huge scoops of mashed potatoes. We shared an appetizer of potato skins, which were okay. The good thing is I had leftovers for lunch the next day. When you're starving and want a meal, even though it's ridiculously overpriced you can count on these generic chain restaurants to deliver a meal that won't be disgusting, but won't be exciting either. I think I'd only come back to Fridays to sit at the bar, if I had to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=160

Michael O.,"Frisco, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/22/2015,"My wife and I went here last night and we're very disappointed. . We walked into the bar for a drink and appetizers. It took a while to have a server come to our table as well. I had to retrieved the menus for us. My beer glass was dirty on top (looked like food on the rim) and when I showed it to the server she gladly replaced it with a new beer and glass. Problem was though, I found the same food on the foam on the beer which makes me wonder if they even gave me a clean glass. The appetizers were so-so (boneless chicken wings were dry, we also had the Ahi Tuna Crisps, and Garlic & Basil Bruschetta). I noticed that the other server on our side was visiting her tables more often than our server did her's. It felt like our server did not want to wait on us at all. Considering that I found the same food particle on my beer glass twice, you would think that good customer service dictates you take it off the bill. Nope! I had to pay for that as well.

We tried to flag down and when we did we ask for more drinks and the results were a 20 min on average wait for the next round.

We were clearly finished with both food and drink for 20 minutes before she came over to ask if we were all finished... she didn't even offer us dessert!

And she wasn't even busy!!!!!! I tipped her one dollar and I wrote on the bill that 40 minutes is way to long to leave a table waiting especially when you aren't even busy.

This particular place need to be bulldozed and rebuild because it looks like a dump on the inside. That said, even a major renovation to the building probably wouldn't save this place. Service is nonexistent, food comes in five different varieties of terrible, and the atmosphere reeks of douche. One thing that is consistent with this location and other Friday's locations are absorbent prices.

Troy S.,"Simi Valley, CA",5,44,,2.0,6/15/2011,"TGIF is a below average alternative to the average / mediocre restaurants in the Simi Valley / Thousand Oaks area.  I think that since there's a bar, it increases the staying power of this restaurant, and that if it stood by its food alone, it would have closed down years ago.  I've never had skinnier ribs before in my life.  Thelivestock must've been abused or starved into submission before they gave up their lives for the ribs I ate.  If I go to Stonefire, Famous Daves,, Bandits (or any of the places that serve real ribs), I get a good healthy portion of baby back.  How is it possible that the portions are bigger at all those other restaurants and smaller at TGIF's?  This perplexes me, but it is very noticeable.  If it wasn't for my daughter loving the desserts that they very recently just put back on the menu, there is no reason to go here.......except for the fact that it stays open later than any other Simi Valley restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-simi-valley?start=200
