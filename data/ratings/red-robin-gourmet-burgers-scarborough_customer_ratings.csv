Also while it was minor it seemed as the bartender was slow with getting orders for the tables which is no big deal but could be better.

The server on this day was very attentive and even at times over aggressive with drink refills and endless fries that come with each burger that is ordered. I had the avocado burger that was cooked perfectly at a medium temperature.  It seemed that they took the time to be exact with the order that I made along with no seasoning on the fries. There were no complaints of about any of the food that was ordered at the table but there were a couple of things that were more situational than anything else.  The server wanted us to join the Red Robin email rewards club so bad that he kept coming back to us over and over again even after we stated that we were not interested.  I eventually caved and signed up through the small iPad that they brought to the table but, by then the folks that I took to lunch were not impressed. The cleanliness of the restaurant was good with the attentiveness of the staff showed through as each table got up, they were there to immediately clean for the next table that sits. Now again, this is not your mom and pops burger joint, but is good for a quick and hearty burger to dive into at lunchtime.  The management and the waitstaff are friendly enough for a chain and you most likely wont leave unhappy (even though some of the reviews tell otherwise)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

We opted for the Southern Charm that comes with candied bacon, onion, BBQ sauce, lettuce on a toasted bun with mayo. The other burgers we have had the pleasure of inhaling here have had flavor and were seasoned well.  This time, no seasoning at all, very bland.  Had to dip it in BBQ for flavor. The fries were crispy but also needed salt.  Amazing what a difference 2 simple spices can make, when used properly.  After being asked by the super friendly bartender, Katelyn, how the burger was and commenting in the lack of flavor and seasoning, she asked the GM, Nicole, came over and apologized but did nothing about it.  The bar manager, Brad,also came by to apologize and finally offered, as we were getting ready to leave, to replace it.  Way too late to save the experience by then.  The tip was definitely for service, not the food.  Common sense tip: if something isn't tasting the way it should or you just aren't happy with it, send it back, you are paying for it.  I expected a small adjustment to the bill, that did not happen.  If you don't really want to know if everything was ok with the meal, don't bother to ask me then do nothing about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

The appetizer was slow to arrive and the manager apologized and took it off our bill. Incidentally, we ordered the new Poutine and it was pretty bland -- I wouldn't get it again.   When the food eventually arrived, some of it had cooled, indicating that perhaps they had timing issues with the rest of the order (it was just my wife, my daughter, and me). I had the ""Big Pig Out,"" which is one of their new tavern burgers. The ""big"" part means that it's supposed to be one large burger patty instead of two smaller patties, but it was underwhelming and definitely not worth the extra $2-$3 for what seemed to essentially be the same amount of meat as the two patty burger. During the last visit we were at the restaurant for more than 90 minutes.

How can you go wrong with a creamy bacon sauce, more please.You can also substitue the fries for another side,such as the delcious cheesy gooey creamy mac n cheese, but it is not endless. I like the pick 2 appetizers. It's two small portions of some yummy fried foods such as jalapeno coin, mushroom, mozzarella sticks, onion rings.  They have decent drink selections and even make some of their own unique cocktails. The service is average to awesome.

Upon going up to be seated, the host, Tom, had clear trouble controlling the iPad seating system they seem to have. After about 5 minutes of him attempting to figure it out he asked my mother if she was over 21. (When she is more than twice that) We were asked this question without any explanation of why, the question was once again asked to me when being seated, again with no explanation on the reason behind the question. We waited another 15 minutes for the waitress to come, but had no clue when she would be coming back, so we capitalized on that time to order our food. The food arrived quickly and tasted fine. Overall it was an okay experience, however we will only go back if we are in the area for another reason and feel like burgers. The beginning service really ruined the overall experience for us, and we are still left wondering why they as how old you are...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
9,Cary C.,"Flower Mound, TX",150,43,91.0,5.0,2016-07-06,Quick seating.  Guide you to a table as requested.  Short wait for waitress. Ziosk did not work.  Waitress ignored Ziosk.  Does not allow you to order. Quick and easy ordering.  Half orders in appetizers available.  Food yet to come.  Love Red Robin so if the chef trained well.  Should be great.  Will see. Took a bit for management to realize the ziosk was blinking.   I had scanned entire system.  Even joined loyalty club.  Still not sure it will allow you to order.  But it will let you see your bill and pay with a printout receipt. Of course sign on the screen... The root beer float was good.  But half filed no bottle of root beer to stretch ice cream. Ice tea unsweetened was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

Worst place I have ever been to managers were awful Rebecca was such an awful person. She treated me as if I was a child. Antonia never paid attention to us and it was just a horrible time.

CAMPFIRE SAUCE, check! (Seriously get the campfire sauce).  They also have a great rewards program. You get a free burger for your birthday month and every ten entrees you buy you get one free.  Their menu changes seasonally which is nice and keeps things interesting.  I also love the atmosphere. They are very kid friendly which is important to me. I also Like that they have lots of non-burger options and chicken and veggie burgers since I'm not a huge burger fan. Let's be honest though, I mostly come here for the fries and campfire sauce anyways.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Perfect size for her. Southern charm burger for me with fries and chicken sandwich, again with special request,  onion straws vs. fries for other person. No problem waitress very accommodating.

1,Phinney C.,"Portland, ME",0,104,8.0,4.0,2017-07-24,"Let me regale you with a not very interesting story, it might even sound familiar. Long day at work, I'm tired, in need of beer and food, but the girlfriend and I must go to the Marshall's to return things. We need something quick and easy and there's Red Robin across the street. I'm too tired to argue but am not expecting much. We sit at the bar, and I'm pleasantly surprised to see they have a Maine Beer Co. beer on, which seems like a small miracle. Then I see this list with other microbrews: Foundation Afterglow, the Maine Beer is not regular ol Lunch (which I would have also happily taken), but a Tiny Beautiful Something. WTF????? I exaggerate not when I say, I was completely blown away and happier than a pig in _____.  The food was perfectly okay. Not the best meal I've ever had in my life, but definitely decent, and definitely better than a lot of other options in the area. I forget the bartender's name, but she had on some rad eyeliner and was wonderful. She was quick, attentive, suggested a good drink for the lady and just all around awesome.  Still though, that beer selection. There used to be Jimmy the Greeks, but since that closed, there's really nowhere else with a decent beer selection (aside from the Sebago/Seadog) in the mall area. I told my GF anytime she wants to spend some quality time at Marshall's/Homegoods, you know just where to drop me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

Daniel provided ""night level"" service at lunch. He was very thorough. Even checking back after I was done.

Was pretty busy, but the wait was short and we sat in the bar and took advantage of a Happy Hour beer. I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O Salad (Cobb Salad) and it was the absolute best Cobb salad I have ever had. For $10.99 I received a very generous mixed greens base, topped with grilled chicken breast, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, hard boiled egg, tomato, avocado, garlic toast and choice of dressing, all artfully displayed over the greens. I could not have asked for more and took a good portion of it home for later. Our server was very friendly, attentive, but not pushy.

2,Rene C.,"Portland, ME",350,183,569.0,3.0,2017-11-22,"My wife and I were out and about picking up a few things before the big turkey day and decided to go to Red Robin for a late lunch. This was my first time here, however my wife had been once before when this store first opened. She could only remember ordering a milk shake. Anyway, I was interested in a burger and very intrigued by the advertisement of there endless fries. When we arrived we had to wait only a minute or two for the hostess to seat us. We were seated in a comfortable booth and our waitress was ready to take our drink order. We ordered waters with lemon and she promptly brought them to our table and took our appetizer order, onion rings and pretzel bits. Amazingly, our app order was delivered lickity split, the quickest I have ever had! Soon after that we ordered out main dishes. I got the famous cheese burger and my wife ordered the half-sandwich and soup deal, getting the French onion soup and the BLTT crousant. We both agreed that the pretzels were fantastic, however the onion rings were greasy and the batter crumbled off before you could eat rhem. Our waitress, who was awesome stopped by several times asking us how the meal was and if we needed anything else. We told her about the rings and she said she was sorry and latter on informed us she took the $5 charge for the rings off our bill. Kudos for her and RR for treating the customer right. My wife didn't care for the French onion soup, but not due to it being not prepared corretly. She had forgotten that it came with soaked bread. Well, I ended up with most of it and it was great! She did find her sandwich very good. My cheeseburger was okay. It was a tad over cooked and had that charbroiled flavor. I managed to rescue a few fries that were lightly toasted on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. The rest were over cooked and hard. Our wonderful waitress offered me some more and I declined. I was stuffed anyway. I more than likely would have taken her up on her offer had most of the fries been the ones I ate that were crispy on the,outside and gooey on the inside. I would say that due to the fact that there a Emre tons of choices to eat around, I probably won't be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
