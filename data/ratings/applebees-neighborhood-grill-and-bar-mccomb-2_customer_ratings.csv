14,Nate A.,"Mandeville, LA",0,43,,1.0,2014-03-28,"I have no clue how this place stays busy, even though it's fairly new it's utterly terrible food wise. I would go back if I was forced to but only for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
12,Craig B.,"Monticello, MS",21,111,225.0,1.0,2014-08-10,"This place will not be getting anymore business from me. We waited for 30 minutes to be seated although there were 8 empty tables. 4 of them stayed dirty for at least 15 minutes. Our drinks stayed empty. The food was average at best. The waitress did the bare minimum. She was obviously not happy to work here. With Santa Fe cattle co being way better and being right next door, you would think that they would try harder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
0,Alexander W.,"Bowie, MD",235,169,16.0,3.0,2014-10-21,"Typical Applebee's --- nothing fancy, but can be a cheap choice for drinks and food if you go at the right time. The hotel we stay at while visiting the area is less than a mile away, so usually go here to unwind after seeing family (you know, the 'need a drink' time) The drinks are decent and if you catch the half-off app special late at night it is a perfect filler for cheap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
8,Brian R.,"Smithdale, MS",2,9,4.0,3.0,2015-01-05,"Most of the time the food is great and the staff is friendly. Today, the staff was friendly, but my pepper crusted sirloin had the taste of mud. When the manager asked how it was, I told him. He laughed and said, ""yeah, we get that a lot."" I said, ""Thanks for the warning.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
13,William H.,"Brookhaven, MS",3,18,,2.0,2015-04-16,"This particular Applebee's is mediocre at best. I've never been impressed by anything here, particularly the wait staff. Good watering hole if that's all you need, but find some other place to get your grub, better food choices are nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
3,Jill C.,"Summit, MS",0,16,4.0,1.0,2015-07-26,"We just ordered burgers through carside to go. For $22 for two burgers, what a disappointment. Fries were stone cold, even though we ordered right outside the restaurant and waited for the food to be brought out. Burgers have gone down in size and quality and had no lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, or condiments of any type. Just burger, cheese, and meat. Very dry meat--fast food quality.  No napkins or utensils in the bag, nothing. There was a hidden toothpick in the burger on which I almost impaled my palate... seriously a terrible takeout experience.  This is my third bad experience in six months at this Applebees, so I am pretty sure that I am done. The only way it stays open, I suppose, is that it is visible from the interstate and catches out of town traffic. Can't imagine anyone subjecting themselves to this regularly when there are better, cheaper options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
11,Buddy C.,"Spartanburg, SC",9,1,,1.0,2015-08-03,Food was overcooked and that was the best part of the meal. The service was horrible and the server had an attitude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
6,Jessica S.,"Brookhaven, MS",28,8,,3.0,2015-10-31,We went there for a late lunch today.  It took forever for a server to come to the table.  I ordered a mojito it was actually very good.  We ordered a couple of appetizers.  The pork and shrimp potstickers and the Kobe meatballs.  The meatballs were cold when I got them.  The best part of that appetizer was the bread.  I got the steak with shrimp and Italian cheese.  It was so salty and the steak was overlooked.  My husband got the broccoli and cheese soup.  He said it was actually good. He also got the shrimp linguine.  He said that the shrimp was cooked well but the pasta was overlooked.  It could be a good place to go and enjoy lunch if they could work on the front of the house issues and consistency in the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
10,Dale G.,"McComb, MS",11,37,57.0,4.0,2015-11-11,"The food here has come a long way since I first visited in 2012, no doubt due to a change in focus. Everybody is going for ""hand-crafted"" these days, Applebee's included. Before when I visited you could tell that everything was pre-made. Sliced chicken on salads were dry around the edges, salads wilted etc. Our recent visit had us saying ""wow!"" A couple of times because the food was actually freshly made. We had the nachos which were flavorful but could have had more toppings, a burger which was delicious, and a wrap which was fresh and tasty. I hope that they keep it up! Our server was great, although there's always too much chatting/playing/arguing towards the back of the restaurant by the staff. They are loud and don't seem to get along, it's distracting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
9,Pat P.,"McComb, MS",0,1,,1.0,2016-02-28,"We went to Applebee's a little before 7pm. Restaurant wasn't full & had plenty of booths & tables empty. Host wanted to sit us at a small table for 2. When we said we'd rather have a larger table he wanted to take our name down for us to wait. We left instead of waiting for a larger booth or table, to come available.

7,Tha D.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",1,43,10.0,4.0,2016-03-14,"Snap decision for dinner, was a good choice. Parking lot was busy- half price appetizers until 7. Not too busy inside and we were seated right away. Our server Destinee was polite and patient. Steak and Parm Shrimp and a Quesadilla Burger ordered after Mozz sticks. Sticks were spot on. Entrees took a little longer, but the steak was cooked perfectly. Burger was great, even though the fries were old and cold. Shame on you, Kitchen...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
4,Herma 8.,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",0,4,,5.0,2016-07-25,"Went to Applebee's for dinner tonight. We have been out on the road for a week and were thankful for the ""healthier options"" part of the menu (though how much more healthy it really was, we don't know. It certainly looked and tasted healthier.)  I ordered the steak tips with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms. They came with some sort of grain that I really liked. My travel companion had a salad with chicken and really enjoyed that too. We were SO happy we got to eat things with actual flavor as opposed to the 'yellow plates' we had been served all week (don't get me wrong: fried food is great, but it's great to mix it up once in a while!) Best part was our server, Diamond, who honestly was SUCH a sweetheart! She was so funny and sincere and took care of us very well. The hostess was also very friendly!  If we ever happen to pass through this town again, we'll be sure to make another stop at this Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
5,Paquita M.,"McComb, MS",84,30,34.0,2.0,2016-09-10,"Normally a great visit but last night was horrible. Of course it was after a football game but the seating and waitresses were quick, nice and attentive. Even the managers were assisting. The issue was the food. Missed ordered and cold food. The managers actually had to take three items back to the cooks. Although my order was adjusted the issue is how the cooks actually thought it was okay to send out cold food. I'll be giving Applebee's in McComb a break for a few months which is sad because there's really not much here to pick from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
1,Laura L.,"MS, MS",26,1,,1.0,2017-07-02,"Bad experience, half of our orders were wrong, asked for smothered chicken and was given a bowl of cut up pieces of chicken in one bowl and green beans in another bowl. Asked for a loaded baked potato with no sour cream, was given a half cooked potato with sour cream, another potato was brought out still half cooked, the replacement order for the ""smothered chicken"" was a quesadilla burger which came out after the table was done eating along with the second potato. Was asked twice for unsweetened tea and both times was brought sweet tea. Service was not good at all. The food was not good. It took forever for someone to bring the bill. We will not be coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mccomb-2,,,,,
