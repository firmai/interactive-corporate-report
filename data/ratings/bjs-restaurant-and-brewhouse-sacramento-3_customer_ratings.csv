They seem to be very busy every time we go visit, usually chill at the bar area. However, their waters/waitresses weren't too efficient; we usually have to wait for like a good 6min when we found a table before someone comes over to take orders. Their food and drink are just ok, I think we like the environment more than everything there, especially if you are a sport game fan - they have many TVs with the games on; I took two stars off because it has been always difficult to get their attention to order more stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=340,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.9880000000000004,2.92

428,Bri R.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,9.0,1.0,2012-01-27,"Where do I start? We called the day of to reserve a spot for 10 people for a friend's a party. We were told that we could only schedule reservation 45 minutes BEFORE the time! How crazy is that?  We called at 5pm and reserved our spot for 5:45pm. I got there at 5:30pm and was told it would be a short wait. Fine, that's okay, I was early anyway. At 6:45pm I WENT OFF! I let the receptionist and the servers hear it. 'They know how to make the reservation, but they don't know how to HOLD the reservation! The holding is the most important part!' (Jerry Seinfeld).  When we finally were seated (7:03pm) our server had the WORST attitude. She didn't even take our drink orders until 23 minutes later. We told her that the checks and orders needed to be separate (so everyone could pay for their own food) and she told us they didn't do that! That way the servers get better tips. When we finally received our ""food"" (8:19pm) almost all our orders were wrong! When we told her she smacked her lips and snatched the food from the tables. RIDICULOUS!!! I was pissed so I gave her an ear full when she came back.  A different server brought us the correct food and when I bit into it, it was like eating a sand burger from the desert... DRY, DRY, DRY! He brought us EMPTY ketchup and mustard bottles, yes, empty and took 7 minutes to bring us new ones. THEY NEVER REFILLED OUR DRINKS... NOT EVEN THE WATER. They food was NOT worth the wait or price at all.  They over charged us because they confused our table with the group next to us. Also, it was sooo cold and dark in that place. I understand setting the mood, but when you have customers everywhere WEARING COATS, GET THE HINT! I didn't take off my coat; I put my gloves on while waiting.

I have ordered, their pizza with my siblings, and cousin.  We had pizza, i believe it was the pig something. icant remember, but it was like a hawaiian pizza.  The crust, was not like a normal crust, it was nice and fluffy crust.  The cheese was right, as the pig was nice and had a good amount of sweet taste.  The pineapple had added the right amount is a slight tang that meld with the pig. That night we had a poozkie.  The poozkie we ordered was a normal size, that was vanilla ice cream.  Their vanilla ice cream was so GOOD!, the cookie was very sweet to my taste.  IT was GOOD!.  The second time that i went with my friends. I had ordered a fish and chips at this location for lunch.  Their fish i wished was more crispy and fully cooked.  The batter seemed as it wasn't fully cooked. I was happy that lemon was included in this dish, because it helped cut the oil taste.  The fries were good, but i had wished it was alittle bit more crispier.  The sauce for the fish, which was tarter sauce was good, it has a nice good tart/sour taste. BUT i can tell you that my 3 other friends enjoyed their own meals.  we had the appetizers and it was good, we had the sample platter that so we tired everything, i loved the dips, and umm.... it was an eggroll, but it wasnt the avocado ones. I can't really remember the name. The third time that i went was with my friends as well.  I had a hard time deciding what to order, but umm the server had help me decided on what was ordered on more.( this was at the location in arden mall) I ordered the chicken crusted parmasean with mashed potatoes.  It was the most crispy chicken ever!.  The chicken was amazingly good.  Their mashed potatoes were good, but i loved the chicken more. my friend loved their dishes and it was fabulous.

Sat at a booth at the bar waited a little long for menu's (but what do you expect when you seat yourself?) plus their was a bit of a server change right in the beginning. We ordered a pitcher of the Jeremiah Red. Not my style at all but a good deep bitter beer for those who are looking.  Ordered the Avocado spring rolls and mozzarella sticks to start it all off. Looking at the menu after 10 mini pizzas are half-off and appetizers were also discounted. I think it was $3 off.  Avocado rolls were awesome, and mozzarella sticks were great. What came next was ordering 3 mini pizzas. We ordered the Spinach & Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken and then the NEW! Gourmet Five Meat pizza. I didn't get to sample the Buffalo Chicken.

When we sat down as a family for brunch, our server asked if we wanted to start with Midori Sours. Um, no, dear - especially not the 13-year old. Speaking of service, turns out BJ's isn't so big on that. Ten minutes and counting before anybody stopped by to say hello. And while our server was keen on upselling us to liquid lunches, she didn't bring water or a sweetner tray for coffee and tea (we heisted one from another server), and her delivery of condiments consisted of slamming down a plastic catsup bottle on the table. On to the food - okay, I guess. Our son really liked his bacon cheeseburger and fries, and the wife thought her turkey club with avocado was good. I had a breakfast pizza - flatbread and marinara sauce topped by what was alleged to be a sausage and mozzarella omelette. Let's just say the flavors were elusive.

Prompt attention and service from the nice bartender.  Beers were served in an ice cold glass.  Try the Jeremiah Red, it's yummy!   Ordered from the light fare menu.  The food was lacking in calories but not in taste!  Had 3 (very small) barbecoa tacos, which were served with black beans and a small pickled carrot/onion slaw.  The meat had good flavor, the beans weren't too salty and I felt satisfied after I ate.  Keep in mind, if you're really hungry, the tacos will not be enough! Finished our meal with a Piranha Pale Ale, which has a crisp hoppy finish.  Very yummy and worth trying. Overall, great service, good food, reasonably priced. Will I be back?  For shopping and beer... YES!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=560,3.44,3.03,3.03,2.9920000000000004,3.194

It must be pretty sad to live in a place with so many wonderful pizza options and think that this is as good as it gets. The food here is okay at best. The pizza is a Chicago-style deal with the very thick crust and the diced tomatoes, but it really just doesn't taste that great. I've had some of the other things, and the experience is about the same. The pasta is okay. The lunch stuff (like the tacos) are okay. But for what you're paying, I'd expect something better. Not being a drinker, I can't really speak to the beers here, but I understand that the variety is vast. That's a plus, if you're coming for that sort of thing.

I sat for about 5 minutes before the waitress came over.  She brought me water and a menu. I politely asked for lime for my water.  About 7 minutes later she came back and asked if I wanted a drink. I asked for a long island and for lime one more time.  Another 7 minutes later, I went up to the bar and got my own lime!  I was halfway through my water when she finally came by with lime!!! I ordered a mini pizza, light sauce.  Receive a pizza with no sauce.  The long island tasted more like sweet and sour and triple sec. My waitress did check on me once after she tried to give me two other peoples bills.  It's been a long process of taking care of my mom and I am grateful to be able to do so, but I just needed an evening where someone waited on me.  I soooo didn't get that at BJ's.   Decided to go home and make my own drink and sit outside.

519,Kerry D.,"Pineville, LA",1,17,,3.0,2012-08-14,"I live in Arden-Arcada, and after Sac Brew closed a few years ago- we have nothing here in the way of microbrew pubs  (there is now Kilt Pub on Arden, a much smaller not so-interesting place).  Anyway, when word BJ's was coming to this area- I immediately hoped they'd take over the old Macaroni Grill location on Alta Arden (which now has become In n Out)   Obviously they didn't, and opted to go right inside the ghetto Arden Fair mall.... well, the consequences of that are apparent.... For one, I can't stand the culture of the entire Arden Fair area- it is sooo ghetto.  Thus I hoped putting the BJ's away from the mall a bit would help- but that didn't happen. So, most times I go to this place (since I have few other choices that aren't a difficult drive from my house)  I deal with the typical ""Arden ghetto-kids""  who are a unique culture of ghetto-rap dressing, meth-head talking misfits who I really don't see around town BUT in this area!   And they are all often at BJ's- talking in their rattle-trap loud way as usual, ordering elaborate shots of liquor to impress their skanky girlfriends.. making the experience for those around them very annoying.  I go to Roseville- I don't see these types of kids.  I go to Reno- they don't exist there.  It is just ARDEN!  So the clientelle here sucks, period.  But other than that, the food is always good, the beers are good with good selection, the service is mediocre  (typical rather aloof hostesses that you encounter at most every other place in the Sacramento area).  Also, I've noticed the prices of their beers & food keep going up every time I visit this place practically-  nearly approaching Yard House levels!  You'd think with the economy sucking in Sacramento, as well as nationwide- that places like this would get a clue and maybe-  make things affordable??  I guess that light hasn't gone on in the heads of the owners here.

475,Michelle H.,"Tucson, AZ",155,30,,2.0,2012-10-21,"In terms of food, a BJ's is a BJ's is a BJ's. In terms of food quality, BJ's gives at least a solid three stars. What makes or breaks a chain such as BJ's is the experience you get at the location. And for me, my experience was none too pleasing. Hostess - keep doin' what you're doin'. Welcoming smile, pretty face - I'm sure it brings people through the door just fine. Server - You need to work on.... just about everything. I was in the area for an interview close by and decided to stop by Arden Fair afterwards for the hell of it. Luckily, my boyfriend and I came in at around Happy Hour. We've never done Happy Hour at BJ's before, but HH anywhere means pretty sweet deals. We asked for one small specialty pizza and asked if we could get an order of a mini-Pizookie. We didn't order any drinks aside from water; quite frankly, we knew ordering that was more than enough to make us full. 1. Server got our order wrong. We were given 2 pizzas instead. We shrugged it off and let it slide. It's fine. Still enough of a calorie bomb to ward off hunger on our stomachs. Bonus for us was that at least the pizzas were on HH prices. 2. Nearing the end of our meal, our server was never to be found. After even flagging down other servers, they were later nowhere to be found. When our server or another server did come by, there was no genuine feeling of service to be found in their expressions. YES, YES, I GET IT. WE DIDN'T PIG OUT AND DISH OUT MAJOR CASH. But A) HELLOOOOO, IT'S HAPPY HOUR!, and B) Don't you want to provide good service to make us WANT to come back and order more the next time? Paying with the server was a pain in the ass. Simply asking for the bill took about 10 minutes. Once the bill came, we slid a credit card in within seconds and had to wait another 10-15 minutes just to have them pick it up. How long did it take us to get our credit card back? Another 10 minutes. I understand if we weren't ideal customers in terms of getting much money from us, but besides the quantity of what we'd ordered, we never acted out or did anything outlandish throughout our meal. We were polite and gave respect to every employee, despite the worsening ""respect"" we got in return from the workers.  To spend 30 minutes of our time just to go through the paying process is not what I call good service. And for the record, the place was pretty EMPTY. It was around 3-4 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.  It's been months since this incident, and I never returned to this BJ's since, nor will I ever return again.

After waiting for 40 minutes we finally got our food. And after all of that waiting...the waitress got my order wrong! A veggie burger on a wheat bun is not that complicated, right?!? So back to the kitchen it went and I didn't see it again for another 15 minutes SIGH. There is no reason lunch at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon should take over an hour and a half for 3 people.

429,Jeremy H.,"Sacramento, CA",89,125,54.0,2.0,2013-01-26,"2 Stars in Yelp reads ""Meh. I've experienced better"" and that pretty much sums it up. I feel like there are a ton of restaurants just like this one and we're all pretty used to them... sure there menu item differences, but I swear they all get their food from the same cheap vendor... whoever that is. Ordered a thin crust pizza, note the ""Thin"" in that description because apparently BJ's has no idea whatsoever that means... or maybe I don't. I always imagined thing meaning skinny or not thick. If I saw a person walking and said they looked incredibly thin you'd imagine my description there (skinny or not thick). BJ's thin crust pizza is thicker than most other regular pizzas I have ever eaten... and I'm an American which means I've eat an ungodly amount of pizza in a proportion that could probably feed a small village in some other countries. If you like thick pizza where most of what you get is doe then you'll love this place. So we did a custom pizza and one ingredient was white onions. I imagined that these would be chopped up or something. I mean, of course they didn't put an entire onion on the pizza, but there was only a few slices of onion and these things were like an entire leaf of union... probably there was about 3 of these leafs spread over the whole pizza and they were each about 3 inches by 3 inches. The salad was even more awful... or rather pathetic. It was like they knew it was bad so they just gave up trying and just threw some cheap green stuff they could find, threw it on a place, and sprayed it with some flavorless dressing. I would have given this place 1 star, but low and behold there was one good thing about this place that was worth an entire star. The beer. I only had one, it was some waste of money expensive special, but I had to have something to wash all their garbage down with, so I got it. Can't remember what it was, but it was dang good. If I was BJ's, and I'm not, nor will I ever name my child anything with that acronym in it, I would make the beer the main focus and food a side note. Though, maybe that's why I don't own any restaurants because that place is always packed even though I hated the food - so apparently a lot of people out there still love this junk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=460,3.04,3.11,3.11,2.44,3.082

When we walked in we were quoted a wait of 20 minutes and they gave us a pager. This was a first for us, having to wait at this location. Once we were seated we ordered right away because everyone was hungry and close to meltdown. We ordered a large BJ's combo pizza with salads for the adults to start and applesauce for the kids. We also asked for bread to avert a crisis situation. The waitress said she could do that and we were very grateful.  The pizza here is pretty good and a large leaves us with leftovers to take home to my grandmother, who also likes the pizza. The crust is very soft so it works well for kids and the elderly alike. We like it for the chunky tomato sauce and tasty toppings. Everything is pretty standard at every BJs I have ever been to, food wise.

The time between ordering and receiving the appetizer was a long one hour.  Finally the main dish came out--we ordered pizza.  First of all, there was absolutely no sauce, very little cheese, very little meat/veggies (which were mostly from a can) on this pizza.  Basically, it was all fatty dough. Disgusting.  I was so hungry and had no choice but to eat some.   I asked to speak to the manager, who then told me that they don't use lots of sauce because it makes the dough soggy (umm...... then don't use so much dough, duh!).  Then she said that the cook simply did not ""disperse"" the ingredients evenly on the pizza (is that a euphemism for being cheap?).  She also said we came at the end of the dinner rush time, so that's why the wait was long.  I wasn't really happy with those explanations, and she offered to buy us dessert.  I didn't want more carbs after that pizza, so I asked if we could get a 20% discount.  Instead, we got $5 off our bill.   It seems like this place is having a lot of turnover.. one of the other reviews stated that the manager is male.  Also, if you're the manager of a restaurant, you want to keep customers coming back.  Sorry, $5 off isn't enough.  It seems like they are having this issue pretty often to not foot my bill.  Don't come here.  Poor management and very poor food.  $40 down the drain..that's like a top right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=560,2.92,3.1,3.1,2.372,3.0280000000000005

The best part is the dipping sauce it comes with, like the sky meets the ocean and the land is born. Okay, that's a bit dramatic. But it's good, try it! Pizookie, no argument that it's amazing. I wish they had more personal sized ones though. Happy hour after 10PM means $2 off appetizers. What a coincidence, my favorite dish happens to be one! The drinks are pretty good, but don't get anything premixed. Their long island might as well be water, totally weak. The waitress said that they were all like $8-$9 but -$1 for happy hour = $9.50? Doesn't make sense, but she recommended a pretty good drink so eh, what the hell. (Peach margarita is tres bien! I think that might be French though :P) When they had the two for $20 special, we got kinda bad service.

So anyways after the previous experience my g/f said Of we should go there and try the Burgers. I was going oh great have to wear my rain boats if going back there again(lol). So on to ordering She wanted a burger (called Black and Bleu) I ordered the Calzone in which tasted like a dry hot pocket made in a microwave. My g/f burger smelled burnt from the time it was on the table. My mistake is i didnt ask her how was it but after her lathering it in ketchup i knew something was wrong. She said it was dry and no BLEU cheese on it and one little tomato paper thin I might add. I asked how was it ordered and she said said med-well. WELL it was WELL done alright and it took me awhile to get the chard taste out of my mouth for the one bite I had of the burger. I asked the waitress that was changed mid way of us eating I asked  what was written on the original order for the burger because this is way over done and she said ""sorry""walked away and then 8 mins later said it was med-well and asked her to look at it and does this look med-well to you? She replied no not really well DUH. So we just laid the gift card for the check that took forever to come and well the gift card is 25 and this 5 should cover the rest  of it and I am not waiting for change and walked away with another bad taste in my mouth in more ways then one. Final Conclusion- How in the hell does have any customer retention here? Beer, drinks Or just a place to hang out and meet up at? I have no no idea but if your looking for a decent meal  the food court upstairs is better then this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=500,2.84,3.12,3.12,2.404,3.0080000000000005

That was my birthday present. About 45 minutes after leaving I realized what happened and I called them. The manager on duty told me the table was already cleaned (the place was closed already), there was nothing left on it and nobody had turned anything in. It's been almost a week now, I have called a few times and their whole attitude is oh, well, that's pretty much gone and there's really nothing they can do for me.

I usually get the deep dish pizza if I come here. I am not a fan of red sauce, and they can substitute it with white sauce. I think the biggest pro of this place is the pizookie. A warmly baked fresh cookie with ice cream on top? I think I may have some! It's delicious. I would recommend the unique flavors like red velvet and the white chocolate raspberry. I am a big fan of the white chocolate raspberry.  Pizookie is such a simple idea. For the bakers out there, they know how easy it is to make cookies and scoop ice cream on top. But when the cookie flavors are more unique, then it's worth it. I came here for the pizookie trio and I left happy. Overall, the food is mediocre. Good happy hour.

377,Tara M.,"Carmichael, CA",22,38,8.0,1.0,2013-06-08,"People! Pay attention to all the reviews saying the service is rotten! Even with these bad reviews constantly coming in BJ's still can't get it right. Our group decided to go there for a special occasion and we called in a reservation which they supposedly said they could do. When the group got there at the time they reserved they still had to wait an hour. After ordering they waited an hour for their food. I was 2 hours late and my group was just being served the food when I got there and there were still people WAITING for their food! Note for those who have never been to any BJ's: it is a full bar restaurant with TVs playing in most corners of the building so the volumes can get pretty loud. The ""manager"" Al came to our table and told our guest of honor to shut up because our table was supposedly getting too loud, this was understandably upsetting to our guest of honor specifically because most of the people at the table were still pretty cranky from being hungry. When two of the orders arrived at the table with tomatoes after they had been specifically asked to be tomato free our table did become progressively loud with anger. We explained that we would not be paying for food that had been brought out after an hour and prepared incorrectly and Al informed us that we would still have to pay or he would call security. He did call security, and the police. We only paid for the incorrectly made pizza because one slice had been eaten (it didn't have tomatoes on the slice). If Al really is the manager, he is by far the worst manager I have ever dealt with. He knows nothing of customer service and belongs nowhere near the food industry. His waiters know what they are doing more than he does; for instance the waitress that served my friend his dessert an hour after he ordered it and after he had to ask twice and was told it was made wrong one of the times, he ended up getting his dessert for free.

After being contacted by the General Manager; Nick I received a gift card in the mail to try and make up for the disastrous celebration dinner we had last week.    Yesterday 06/18/13 myself and three of my daughters went back into the restaurant for lunch. We arrived at about 12:45 after a long morning of shopping. As was the case last time our hostess was very welcoming and sweet. She said we would be seated within about 10 minutes and that was accurate. Our server was Crystal and she was an angel too!! Very friendly and engaging with my teenagers and very attentive. She made sure we had our water and drinks and kept everything refilled and had a charming demeanor. She made all the girls feel special. We all ordered lunch and I again for the sake of the experiment ordered grilled shrimp tacos. The girls ordered, chicken strips, chicken lettuce wraps & a thai salad. We also ordered an appetizer of avocado egg rolls. Everything came out in the correct order and was hot and fresh. We didn't have to wait to long at any point in the lunch. All of the lunch food was excellent and got rave reviews from the kids and my tacos were delicious! The egg rolls got only so so reviews. It was prepared and served perfectly we just didn't like the mushy texture.. Nothing but avocado and cream cheese on the inside so well, mushy. The outside was crisp and hot and fresh though.  The price for lunch was a little high, about $80 so we probably wouldn't eat there all the time but my second visit really changed my mind about the restaurant.

368,Crystal C.,"Sacramento, CA",301,418,705.0,3.0,2013-08-13,"I had a shockingly good time here, but my expectations were low to begin with. I was stuck at the mall because I needed my iPhone serviced at the Apple store. Which is more complicated and time consuming than it ought to be, and resulted in my boyfriend and I having to wait for my appointment (they're always running behind), then emerging starving and stressed from the Apple store a while later. We needed food and booze stat, and Hot Dog on a Stick was not going to cut it. We were told it a table would be ready in five minutes, which actually turned out to be over ten minutes. We hardly noticed because we'd already cruised over to the bar and had pints in hand by the time our buzzer went off.  Can we take a moment to appreciate their beer selection? Just, wow. What isn't available on their wall o' taps is available in bottles. Plus, Rogue Dead Guy on tap? Keep 'em coming. We ordered the watermelon and feta cheese appetizer salad, which came after we'd been seated at our table. The salad was delicious and I plan to swing by and get it again next time I'm in the mall. I ordered the blackened salmon with white wine and butter sauce dinner with rice pilaf, steamed veggies, and chicken tortilla soup. You get a lot of food for the price, but it's just too much food. Unless you're starving or sharing, get something light or something that will make food leftovers.  The chicken tortilla soup was interesting because the waitress arrived with a shallow bowl with a handful of multicolored tortilla chip shreds and sliced avocado in the bottom and asked if I had the soup. Um, yes, but that is not soup. It was then I noticed the little metal pitcher in her other hand. She put the bowl down and poured the broth portion of the soup over the tortilla shred and avocado. At first I thought it was weird, then realized it was genius. Done that way, the tortilla shreds are still crunchy and the avocado is still cold when you start eating, which has changed chicken tortilla soup for me forever. If I'm in the mall I will be stopping by for another bowl of this soup. I was pretty much full by the time the actual meal arrived, but took a few more bites of everything. The salmon was good but unremarkable. The white wine and butter sauce was very rich and good at first, but cooled down quickly and kind of congealed. Yuckers. The pilaf was bland and the steamed veggies were a tad overdone and had no butter or sauce or anything. Meh. I'm not sure I would order that dish again. The service was friendly but, as others have stated, a bit slow. The atmosphere was a bunch of families and people escaping the hustle and bustle of the mall. Noise level was a dull roar, but you could still hear what the person across the table was saying.  Considering my anxiety level at malls and disdain of the food court, I know I'll be back for a pint, the watermelon feta salad, and a bowl of soup next time I'm at Arden Mall.

I want to make that clear because I'm not saying BJ's deserves 2 stars because they're not Chez Panisse. They deserve 2 stars because, even as a middle of the road casual chain restaurant, they fail. My dining partner and I had the spaghetti with marinara and the veggie burger with seasoned fries. Only the fries were of acceptable quality. The spaghetti was overcooked and mushy, and we're pretty sure they covered it in the spicy sauce even though my dining partner ordered the regular sauce. This was one of the view vegetarian-friendly items on the menu, and it was unacceptably bad.  I had high school boyfriends who made better spaghetti.  For nearly $10, the waiter brought out a plate of watery, mushy noodles with sauce that wasn't even particularly good. The veggie burger was only marginally better, but it was by far the worst veggie burger I've ever had at a restaurant. The bun was toasted to the point that it was crunchy and dry, and the burger was tiny in relation to the massive bun. The burger was pretty bland, and the menu didn't say what exactly was in it. The fries were good, but the waiter didn't bother to bring ketchup out with the food, so both the burger and fries were fairly cold before I actually started eating.

305,Brent R.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,13,1.0,2.0,2013-09-15,"When I was exploring places for lunch on Yelp, at first I disregarded this BJ's restaurant because of the three star average review they had received. But because I have been to other BJ's before, and never had an issue, I decided to try it anyways.  To keep this short, I am just going to highlight the issues I had. Most of the food was what I would expect from BJ's, and for the most part the waitress was average to slightly above average (quick drinks, checking in with us enough, but not too much).  The really problem was with an omelette that one person at our table ordered off the brunch menu. This omelette looked like something that was frozen, microwaved, then set under a heat lamp for a couple of hours. It was complemented with some fast food like fried potato squares and plopped on a plate with no presentation. The patron took two bites out of the omelette and pushed the plate to the side, in obvious distaste. Then he grazed off the rest of our plates for the rest of the meal. The real shocker in this story was that the waitress noticed the full plate pushed to the side, but never once asked if there was a problem or how the food was. She asked if we wanted a box, I said no need. Then the owner of the omelet said ""Actually I think the dogs would eat this."" And that was it, we paid and left, never to return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=380,2.84,3.01,3.01,2.6320000000000006,2.9419999999999997

We ordered the GF veggie pizza with roasted garlic and spinach and it was incredibly delicious! I didn't feel like I was missing out on traditional pizza at all! We also got the GF pizookie and I must say that flour is such an essential ingredient to a cookie, lol but the pizookie wasn't that bad. I think it was a little overcooked but it was still ""eat-able"" and we had them top it with the peppermint ice cream (now that the holiday flavors are in!) Our server was decent but not memorable. What I didn't appreciate was I wanted to use a Visa gift card towards the bill and was told that the card was declined because BJ's run all their cards as ""debit"" and not ""credit"". Uhh, we live in 2013..large franchised restaurants should be able to run ""credit"" when handed a credit card, debit card, or Visa/AMEX gift card. This was definitely a turn-off but whatever.

426,Victoria S.,"Gilroy, CA",13,11,2.0,1.0,2013-11-20,"I attempted to visit this restaurant on Friday 11/15 and when I entered I was created by no one. I stood there with my friend and neither or I was acknowledged; needless to say after 10 minutes of standing there. ( I even walked up to the host and attempted to talk with her.) I left the restaurant and went elsewhere.  The next day on 11/16 I was in the Arden area again, I decided many the previous day was probably just a special circumstance so my Aunt and I decided to take lunch at BJs again. I assumed it would be busy so we arrived there about 1:20. When we got there my Aunt asked for sitting outdoor because we were on a schedule and the hostess flat out refused us. She said ""No~ you have to wait 10 to 15 minutes to be seated out there."" Neither of us understood why because there were only 2 tables occupied in the outdoor area. Finally at 1:45 we were called to be seated, I remember because by this time I was saying ""okay well if they take any longer we will just leave."" Specifically we were never told the wait would be longer than 10 - 15 minutes so when it changes to 20-25 minutes the Host should let people know. Anyways, we handed her back our buzzer and she told us Amy would take us to a table. So we went to the backside of the Hostess booth and stood there, waiting, waiting and waiting. Again, no acknowledgement  and there was a woman standing there, she just stared at us like we were crazy. Until finally my Aunt asked, ""So is anyone going to seat us?""  The woman who was standing there; who I am assuming was the manager on duty ( she was in a chambray (denim colored) button down shirt and she had short brown hair) was flippant and rude in her answer. She was like "" Well did someone call your number?"" and I was like "" Yeah we gave her the buzzer and she told us someone would seet us."" Then suddenly a girl in a black cardigan came rushing in from nowhere before the ""manager woman"" said anything else and fumbled grabbing menus as she herded us out to a table.  As we were walking away the manager woman felt the need to add in a sarcastic tone, ""Have a great lunch."" We were made to squeeze between the chairs of other customers to even be able to reach a table and those customers already seated as well.  We were finally seated at 1:50; the girl told us our waiter would be with us soon and she quickly left. We looked over the menu for awhile deciding what we wanted; we had decided on appetizers, pizza and we were going to get a few drinks. So we waited and waited; again I didn't understand what was going on because the waitress was outside helping other tables and taking drink orders and she never even acknowledged us to tell us she would be with us soon. Finally after 10 mins; at 2:00 we gave up and left. So much for that, I was extremely disappointed because I had really wanted the food and wanted to try a new beer. Needless to say I don't think I will come back to this BJs. Two-days in a row experiencing bad service doesn't seem like a coincidence. I don't think I can even call that bad service because it is more like no service. I ended up leaving on both occasions.  The restaurants I went to afterward were just as busy, acknowledged me once I entered the door, sat me within the quoted time and had a waiter at my table in a reasonable amount of time. I'm not going to go back to your BJs because I don't want to waste my time in a establishment where I'm not going to end up eating and I'm not going to go somewhere that has a manger that acts so rudely with customers. I'm definitely going to be telling others about this experience.

This go around I had the full rack of ribs for $20.  Came with one steak side & soup or salad.  Went with the horseradish mashed & chili which was offered as a soup.  The chili was okay with some shredded cheddar and a nice amount of sour cream on top but tasted canned.  I can live with that although it's not beans.  The horseradish mashed was EXCELLENT.  The ribs were an actual full rack that only costs $3 more than a half rack.  Cooked perfectly for a chain that doesn't smoke them.  The sauce was also perfectly done.  I prefer a dry rub but can live with sauce if it's not opened floodgates.

About 25 minutes they said. Off we go to BJ's!  We get there & they get my name. I would say about 10 minutes later we got seated. Score!  We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip & chips for appetizers. Delicious!  I ordered a pomegranate margarita. Oh boy that was strong! I just turned 21 not too long ago so I'm still trying out new drinks. I had to wait until it got watered down with the ice to finish it.  The boyfriend ordered the scampi pasta with a piece of grilled chicken added & I ordered the Cajun pasta.  The wait for the food was I would say about 20 minutes. Not too long for a typical wait time at BJ's.  The garlic bread our pastas came with we're pretty burnt. Neither of us ate them & didn't bother asking for more. My pasta was quite good but it tasted way too much like tomato sauce. It tasted more like spaghetti than Cajun. The boyfriend said his only had the spices on top of the pasta and the bottom was tasteless.  Overall, the food was ok. Im giving them such high stars bc for the first time ever our wait time was really short. Like I've said in the past with BJs ratings, they've actually forgot about us. The portion sizes are huge. I maybe ate half my pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=300,3.04,2.92,2.92,3.024,2.9680000000000004
88,Donovan H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",298,320,1322.0,4.0,2014-02-16,"You know how I feel about chain restaurants.. Especially when the food is predictable at any place you go to from coast to coast. However, I will admit that the food at ""BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse"" is slightly above what you would find at say, a TGIFridays, Applebee's, and Chili's. With that said and done, ""BJ's"" is probably my favorite go-to spot for consistently good standard comfort food. What makes this ""BJ's"" different than most is that their building is integrated in the Arden Fair Mall. This makes it a very convenient location after a complete day of shopping. And I like the fact that (even on the busiest days and evenings), parking isn't too difficult to find. For those of you who remember, the building itself used to be part of the (not-so-popular) ""California Cafe"". And when I found out a ""BJ's"" was set to open in early-2011, my excitement grew as I've always loved their amazing brewed craft beers. My review that I am focusing on is their Happy Hour that runs every Monday through Friday from 3-7pm. This is probably the best thing that ""BJ's"" has going on and their prices are unbeatable. I came here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday afternoon around 3:30pm as their was an abundance of empty tables throughout the restaurant. We decided on sitting near the bar as that would be an ideal area to track down the bartender and hostesses.  Keep in mind, I've never been here for Happy Hour until this recent experience. I was pretty amazed with the selections that were offered in the $4.00, $5.00, and $6.00 price range. I started off by ordering a ""California Club Flatbread"" with their signature ""BJ's P.M. Porter"". Both are priced at a very affordable $4.00/each. Our drinks and food come out in a very timely manner. I was definitely impressed with the size of this flatbread as it had a nice selection of grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. It was then completed with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Their P.M. Porter hit the spot too as I'm a sucker for dark beer. It had the consistency and richness of a Guinness beer but not as thick. As the afternoon migrated into the evening, their were many more appetizers that we took advantage of before the 7:00pm Happy Hour cutoff time. For $4.00, I also sampled their ""Margherita Fresca Flatbread"" and ""Boneless Wings"". The flatbread was decent but not as good as the ""California Club"". We loved the wings though as they packed the perfect amount of spice to every bite. For $5.00, we sampled their ""Chicken Pot Stickers"" which were pretty good but were slightly undercooked. And finally for $6.00, we sampled their (very popular) ""Avocado Egg Rolls"". These definitely hit the spot, crispy on the outside and soft avocado on the inside; especially after I was already working on my 4th beer at this point. Overall, I'd have to say if you're NOT coming here for Happy Hour, I'd have to rate ""BJ's"" only 3-stars. I've dined here on numerous occasions in the past and the food is your predictable standard comfort food. But the Happy Hour makes up for that, especially with the affordable deals on the food and craft beers. And if beer isn't your thing during Happy Hour, they sell well drinks (for $4.00), martinis (for $5.00), and a nice selection of wines (for $6.00). So eat, drink, and be merry at your Arden Fair ""BJ's""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=160,3.12,2.93,2.93,2.9280000000000004,3.0060000000000002

My sister in law and I came here after a wedding rehearsal starving. We were seated in the bar area which wasn't even busy at all. I remember seeing at least 2 servers manning this area. The guy took our drink orders and then never returned to take our food order. He walked passed us multiple times, clearly noticing we still had menus on the table. Over half an hour had passed and we still hadn't been helped. I left $5 on the table to cover the expense of our drinks (I'm not one to dine and dash, no matter how bad the service is) and left. As I was leaving, I politely notified the host that we hadn't been served and that I was pretty upset. She apologized & I told her it wasn't her fault, but maybe to bring it up to a manager so that situations such as these don't come up again.

When we walked in apparently the host didn't want to greet us, instead I greeted her. It takes her a long minute to look for a place for us to sit. She comes back and ask of it's ok to sit at the bar and I told her sure. But at the moment I'm on crutches and I had to hop my way up the stairs. I'm looking though the menu and I know I wanted the choose 8 from the 10 beers they have to offer, my server comes by and I tell her what I want and instead of writing down what I wanted she tells me about happy hour.

Our drinks come out, then our food. She came to check up on our table but we were good. California pizza flatbread was great, there's avocado, chicken, cheese, tomato... It was pretty simple and good. I love chicken wings so they're always good to me. Sliders were good just cheese, meat, and bread, couldn't ask for ketchup because we finished our meal already. My sister always order the Parmesan crusted chicken, so I'm assuming it's really good to her.  Over the food was good. But our server never came back. Usually when you're busy I totally understand, but when you notice that all of our food was gone, you'd come back to check up on us. But she was in the back the whole time, she couldn't have noticed our empty plates. I wanted to order dessert too! It was our birthday, we wanted a pizookie. I was so irritated.

Our last time here, our server even replaced a side dish that was perfectly made but I didn't really care for, without me having to ask. Seeing a business go above and beyond to serve their guests is refreshing and the mark of great customer service. Mr. Gary Ford is often the night manager during our visits and is always helpful in attending to any needs or requests. As a whole, their service throughout the restaurant always appears fluid and orderly. We have never had a bad experience at BJs and without hesitation they deserve 5 stars.

214,Veronica S.,"Sacramento, CA",132,279,415.0,2.0,2014-04-05,4 stars for the food. 2-3 for the service. It's really a hit or miss but lately they've been slacking. Most of the time I go here with my friend and we usually never have to wait to be seated or the wait is really short which is nice. However last time after we were seated it took over 10 minutes for our waitress to get to us. I had to go up to the hostess and inform her. When I did she just glanced at our table and mumbled something like ohh ok. No apology or anything. Our waitress was ok. Our drinks were never refilled though which was annoying. Food took awhile too. Appetizers came out quickly but the main dishes took over 20 minutes. Love that BJ's has a pay on your phone option now. We weren't even thinking of using it but since our waitress was taking forever with our check we ended up using it anyways. I guess I just find it weird that every time I go here and have bad service it's never extremely busy which could explain the delay on the food.

336,Jamie S.,"Sacramento, CA",111,237,85.0,3.0,2014-07-05,"What is the deal with finding someone to staff their patio? I really like BJs. I really do. Their avocado egg rolls are always a must, and as a vegetarian I can't go wrong with either a pizza or veggie burger. Their Jeremiah Red ale is my favorite, and the Tatonka stout is a lovely break during the holiday shopping season. Their massive on-tap selection is worth a stop all on its own. Overall the food is predictable with other chain restaurants with a huge selection; a bunch of stuff that they keep frozen and heat up for you, pretending that they ""made"" it. Not complaining about the food, as that seems to be an industry standard among chain restaurants these days.  My point of contention is their patio service. There are relatively few restaurants in the Arden area with patio dining. In fact, I will often try a new place ONLY because they have a patio. If I was trying a place for the first time and was told that their patio dining was an issue, I'd probably leave to go someplace else.  But..... Every single time I have gone to this location and asked to sit outside, the staff asks like I'm asking them to go above and beyond their job to ""find someone"" to serve the patio. Why? Why do they even have a patio if no one can sit there? Why is it an entire ordeal to sit there? Why do I have to hear from a hostess about how busy the servers are every time I go? Why does asking for a patio table seem to bewilder the hostess so much? Perhaps the bigger question; Why do they even clean the patio tables, set them with condiments drink menus, etc, if they have no intention of sitting anyone there? The last time I went to BJs, I was going only to have a beer with a friend, and we were told that we could only use the patio seating if we first got our drinks at the bar and brought them out ourselves. Next time I might just end up getting my own takeout from a different place before going to BJs.  I realize that this most likely is not the hostess's fault, but damn. You would think that being this location is less than 500 feet from a Cheesecake Factory, with it's near-identical menu and conflict-free patio service, that they would at least have that area staffed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=300,3.28,2.99,3.044,2.508,3.106

339,Petite G.,"Roseville, CA",3,17,4.0,2.0,2014-07-20,"I'll start with the summary:  Food is ok, service leaves a lot to be desired.  Two stars.  Not recommended.  We won't be coming back here. We recently came here with a party of 10 on a weekday.  It took them a long while to seat us (45 minutes!) and others who came after us got seated ahead.  We patiently waited, since taking a group of 10 people to another restaurant at dinnertime seemed a bit daunting. We finally got our table and put in our orders with a member of the staff, who was friendly enough.  While we were waiting for the food to be served, another server came and said that our original server was on break and that he would be taking over.  After about half an hour, the food started arriving.  Everyone's food came except for my hubby's entree.  When most of the people in our party were halfway through their dishes and his entree still did not arrive, my hubby gently reminded the server about it, and said that he (my hubby) had ordered it at the same time that everyone else in our table ordered their food.  The server said that he was going to check with the kitchen, and rushed off.   Minutes passed and almost everyone had finished their appetizers and entrees, but still no sign of my hubby's entree.  So we followed up with the server again.  He said that since my hubby just ordered it a few minutes ago, it was still not done.  What?! This was a lie by the server, because 1) we ordered it with the rest of the meal and heard it confirmed verbally by the original server and 2) the ""relief server"" heard my hubby say we ordered it a while back, along with everyone else at our table.  He (relief server) did not even apologize, and rushed off again.  We had to call him back and ask him to check the kitchen.  And lo and behold, a few minutes later, he was back with the entree, which was now pretty cold!  So, a lying server + poor training = not a good experience. What saved the evening was the fun company and the pizookie.  Otherwise, the food is just average, and if we really want chain-restaurant food, we can get more flavorful versions at Chili's or The Cheesecafe Factory next time.  We were unhappy with the service here, and we will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=300,3.08,2.99,3.036,2.6320000000000006,3.0260000000000007

Overall, average to above for food quality during happy hour.  Pretty good drafts as well. I've always liked their beer. Went with IPA. Well balanced and easy to drink. We got the last bar table and our service was right on. Our server was attentive and she had great support. Love when teamwork is apparent.

It took too long for our server to take our orders, and he took both drink and food orders in one shot. At least give me my drink first! It was also nearly impossible to flag him down for my mocktail refill. Maybe service will be better when it's less crowded. I ordered a Peachberry Iced Tea (Mocktail). It was sweet and refreshing. Plus, free refills! For my entree, I ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken. It was absolutely delicious! The chicken breast is extremely tender and juicy. I was surprised it wasn't dry at all! Also, the balsamic glaze was perfect. It didn't overpower the seasoning on the chicken. The entree included a side of salad and a side of mashed potatoes. I finished half at the restaurant and took the other half home. It tasted good even after it was reheated.

It tasted crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The pizza was a little too oily for my liking (and no, it's not because of all the meats). The meats and cheese also came right off the pizza bread, hence very messy to eat. The jambalaya tasted delicious at first, but a couple bites it got way too greasy.

She was really nice and was definitely one of the best servers I've ever had out of all the ones that I've been to. I ordered a top sirloin with a baked potato and caesar salad. I got the salad first and it was okay. It was kind of sour and some pieces of lettuce were pretty limpy. I didn't get a lot of croutons either, but whatever. When I got the sirloin and baked potato, the meat looked dry and the potato was just warm. I didn't complain too much about the potato because it was soft enough but the meat kinda bothered me a little bit. I usually cut the top sirloin into bite-sized pieces but this portion was really tough. There were some dry and chewy parts, but there were some softer and juicier parts too. I don't know, it kinda felt like the meat was just reheated. It should've been a lot better than that considering it's around $13. So, the only thing that really pissed me off was a customer. I know BJ's can't control the customers they get but this one guy was out of control. It seemed like he was drunk, but he was talking really loud and he said some inappropriate things. Shouldn't he have been kicked out by then? I looked at some of the families around us and they didn't look too happy since they had kids with them. I was hoping that a server or the manager would tell him to keep it down - especially since so many servers walked by. Instead, a server kept bringing him beer and his actions got worse and worse.

We came in late and sat in the cocktail area, where we were served by a very sweet girl with an accent,  I cannot remember her name for the life of me. But I do remember that she is vegetarian too! So she was very understanding that I wanted my pizza without meat, and when I got it WITH meat on it she immediately knew how gross it feels to us vegetarians to just pick it off so she offered to remake it right away.  Knowing that my boyfriend eats meat because his order was a meatlovers pizza, she offered him a box for my messed up pizza so he could take it home and enjoy it later. That was really cool of her! He did take it home and ate it for lunch the next day, he said it was very, very good! It took a while for my pizza, eventually the chef came walking out with it, that's right, the chef made it a point to come all the way to our table to apologize saying that it was his mistake.

224,Jamaica S.,"Sacramento, CA",30,38,15.0,1.0,2014-10-31,"My husband and I tried this place about a year ago,   I ordered the Mahi Mahon tacos he got the chicken sandwich. It's kinda hard to mess up a fish taco. It took about 30 min for our food to arrive during lunch hour, we tried to sneak a day date in wo. the kids. It grew frustrating to see people who arrived after me eating before me, it wasn't a complicated order or anything.  Mahi Mahi tacos;  1 fried,1 grilled. Fried fish tastes frozen fish sticks put in grease (they were burnt, but I was starving). The grilled one was bland and flavorless. A creamy ""guacamole-like"" dipping sauce, tasted like avocados and mayo mixed (yuck) the salsa was the basic jar variety (pace if I'm not mistaken) Best part was my strawberry lemonade. The waitress tried her best was does the waitstaff ever taste the food? ?? Fried chicken sandwich;  nicely Fried and seasoned chicken breast on a grilled roll, my husband said he'd try it again,  for him that's saying alot. Take 2 today; while at the mall hunger struck my two kids down for the count, I considered BJ's again letting bygones be bygones plus the kids wanted to try the Pizookie (why is there no Sniderdoddle pizookie?? whoever turned that idea down should've been fired places like c.r.e.a.m are selling the combo of snikerdoodle and ice cream and are making a killing) my husband was in the process if upgrading my kids' phones and we were hungry so this time we decide to only order appetizers while we waited for him. this proved to be a not so good idea as I ended up just paying for the starters tipping and leaving. the sampler plate comes with an assortment of different Lil fried bites none of them out shined the other at all, the artichoke dip needed something salty in it to balance out the creaminess. there were avocado rolls (the nastiness creamier most oddest made edible thing ever) it lacked any sort of substance to hold it together so it was like biting into fried bland guacamole wrapped in an egg roll wrapper.  stuffed mushrooms; spinach and cheese topped with parm. these were okay too, I just wish someone who really knew how to cook and season food worked there,  it had the potential for something great but it missed the mark only in seasoning.  I looked at the menu for about 20 min before deciding this place wasn't worth trying an entree. we booked it out of there quick, smh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=280,3.12,3.02,3.036,2.7880000000000003,3.0600000000000005
384,Jewels M.,"Yuba City, CA",178,38,26.0,5.0,2014-11-08,"Bj's is truly one of my favorite restaurants! I love getting the crispy fried artichokes appetizer and then for my main dish I usually share with someone and get the amazing and tasty parmesan chicken or a deep dish, gluten free or flat bread pizza. It all matters when I'm there and who I'm with but those are my favs!  I love a deal so whenever it works out I go for happy hour. They offer the California flat bread pizza (half size) for $4 and the personal mini deep dish for $6 as well as many other great options.  Tip- They only have one gluten free pizza option and it's a 10 inch so when you order the mini deep dish during happy hour they'll let you order the gluten free option for the same price ($6) with any toppings you want. It's seriously the best gluten free pizza you'll ever taste. I get mine a little well done and it's almost tastes the same as their flat bread.  That and they offer some pretty great happy hour drinks as well. I enjoy the ($5) lemon drop.  After all or that if you didn't eat too much you have to try a pizookie! Yummy!  I'm getting so hungry now! I wish I lived closer to a BJ'S location.  You know it's my favorite when I drive nearly an hour just to go eat there.  Side note- If you haven't done so yet I highly recommend that you sign up for their rewards card. You don't have to carry the card on you! They can look it up or if you download the app they can scan your card that way!

However, our first experience at this arden location we expirenced not only bad, but escalated into horrible customer service not only from our waitress (Devanie) but from the manager(Al) as well. To start, the waitress forgot my friend's drink, forgot my bread bowl after all the food came out and we had to ask where it it was after our friends were halfway done eating their main entrees. Also didn't refill our waters, had to ask even though all the empty glasses were at the end of the table after she passed countless times. & on top of speaking to the Manager, the manager told us he wanted us to tell us what should happen. I work in customer service and my friend is a manager, the manager could've been truthful and at least asked what can WE do to make it better not say it's up to you what you want to happen. Not even at least offer a bread bowl and apologize for this experience. The way he spoke made us feel as if we were trying to get something free when all we got from him was a half apology/explanation with a full priced bill until we seriously asked for an accomodation. Also waitress came back with our bill and did not apologize at all. Worst experience ever, point blank.

Well anyways, one time I went with a classmate to squeeze in dinner in between classes and didn't know what we wanted. We glanced at the menu and our waiter said.... I kid you not, -annoyed voice- ""Will you hurry up and order?"" I responded, what? ""Yeah, you're taking up my time."" What?! I was so shocked that I decided to live tweet what she was saying to the other people there for dinner. It wasn't nice at all. Haha Another time I went, they took FOREVERRRRRR. Like FOREVER. My roommate and I went and it took the 30 minutes to greet us at the table, bring waters and then add 10 minutes of finally getting our order in... Oh and there was like 2 families in the entire restaurant. Take goodness for the pay-early-app.  Recently, I did an office take out order and when I went to go pick it up, practically everyone was in a bad mood. I went up to the hostess to ask if she can call someone to the togo counter and she was like, ""Just wait over there and be patient."" OKAY. Sorry. I said PLEASE and I am told I'm a nice person. A few other times I went they weren't so bad, but I had dealt with a few attitudes when I asked them to scan my reward card and such.  Food: It's good, but only if you order your usual.

229,Lawrence B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,2.0,2015-01-18,"The meal started out pretty well, as my party of four got a table for lunch with no waiting. Our waitress was a nice young brunette who brought water quickly. Then the trouble began. After choosing what to order, it took the waitress 20 minutes to notice we were waiting for her. And it was another 25 minutes for the food to arrive! My clam chowder was very good, and my burger was great. My date's French Dip was mediocre (her words) at best. Her sandwich had almost no cheese, and the bread was inedible. My buddy's fries were only lukewarm.  Following the meal, our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert. We decided to split a Pikoozie (ice cream & cookie), and then proceeded to wait forty-five (45) minutes. Our dessert plate and spoons arrived, but no food to go with it! Furthermore, the waitress seemed to be avoiding us. Being left waiting is bad enough, but being clueless about the state of your order is inexcusable! Time was ticking down, and my buddy had to catch the train to San Francisco. Finally, we spotted the waitress and I physically intercepted her and told her to forget the dessert and just bring the check. It was only then--amidst hurried apologies--that she admitted the cook had made the wrong dessert and that she'd had to instruct him to make the right one! A little communication to us might have been nice! After a fifteen minute wait we got the check. I was tempted to leave my ""pointed insult tip"" (1/2 a penny), but I gave her the benefit of a doubt and left two dollars and change.  On the way out I stopped to use the bathroom. The overhead speakers were blasting music at 105 decibels (according to my sound-meter app), and the echo effect was terrible! The men's room was clean and nicely decorated, but you'd better bring shooting plugs to save your ears! That is not what a restroom should be like!

Went in on a Wednesday for a birthday.  We were put at a super tiny table for six people.  With all of the advertising stuff they have on the tables, there really isn't any room to put anything.  We brought two bottles of wine with us.  The server  asks if we brought a wine opener. (Yeah, no).  A couple minutes later she returns with a wine key and glasses.  I'm thinking she is going to open our wine for us.  Nope.  She just hands my boyfriend the wine key and says ""here ya go!"" and walks away.   We ended up opening the bottles ourselves which, heads up to management, I think might be border-line illegal...? Even if it isn't, I can open my own wine at home and not be charged a $7 corkage fee.   Once the food came, everyone's but mine came out.  When I asked her about it she went to go check.  She came back about 5 minutes later stating that it would be about 5 more minutes because the kitchen ran out of pasta.  Having work in a restaurant, myself, I know that was pretty much code for ""I forgot to ring in your food, but I'm going to blame it on the kitchen so you don't think it's my fault and hopefully save my tip"".

When we finally got our food all of our burgers were cooked the same, and when I say cooked, I mean left on the grill to get all dry and charred. Why ask me how I want my burger then to just cook all the burgers very well done? And the toppings I had on my burger we scarce and depressed looking. Don't get the jalapeño burger. It sounds like a good idea. But those jalapeños were the size of almonds. And there was like 5 of them... With no chipotle sauce. Lastly we waited for 10 minutes for a pizza togo box. Positives: cold drinks, nice atmosphere, not too loud(as some bjs are) Negatives: the food was poorly done, the servers seemed to not work well together (very disorganized)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=360,3.24,3.22,3.084,3.1160000000000005,3.2280000000000006

We arrive & the hostess just stares at us. No hello, no smile. My friend and I asked for a table & she told us that it was happy hour at the bar & it's probably easier if we just go seat ourselves. We looked at the bar & it  was completely packed. We told the hostess that there wasn't 2 seats for us to sit & she said we could probably ask someone to scoot over. Uh, no? We asked again for a table & she was like ""well...*eye roll* okay hold on."" Looks at this paper, assumingly, for open tables and then says ""k. Wait"". I looked at my friend & even she said that this hostess didn't want to seat us. I checked outside the door to see what time it closed just to make sure we weren't coming in like five or ten minutes before they closed, then I would understand because that is annoying. We showed up two hours before they closed at midnight. She grabs the menu's and says ""k this way."" Drops our menu's off and then just walks away. Our server took about 20 minutes to greet us but overall he was okay. I later overheard another female waitress yell ""Kevin!"" to one other server. She was at the register punching it something and my friend & I could hear her loud voice cussing away, bitching about how the hostess was double seating her. Being in restaurant business before, I could see why that would be overwhelming but this was a Thursday night, it was not crowded at all. I definitely think she could handle the few tables she had. She was dropping F bombs like no other (not that I care but in a professional setting, as loud as she was, was very inappropriate).

Ordered a soda came right up. Checked back in on me like a min or two later. I decided to get the chicken buffalo pizza. It was spicier than usual due to more of hot sauce on top. However I love hot sauce so it didn't bother me. Then I ordered a mini pizookie (not sure on the spelling) anyway a runner gave me the food and it was a regular size, it was a mistake, and after talking to the server they gave it to me but charged the mini size. All through my waitress was super attentive. When I got the bill I noticed that she did charge right but what was awesome was that she save me money instead of paying $10.00 for a mini buffalo pizza she charged a build your own pizza with unlimited toppings which was $6.00.

There wasn't a wait and we sat down in one of the quieter areas. Our waitress was extremely friendly and kind to us but I forgot her name! My bf ordered the fish & chips and I ordered the top sirloin medium w/ white cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus. My bf said his dish was good but mine was far from it. The steak was cooked beyond well done and the waitress knew there was an issue even though she was standing on the other side of the room. She came over, asked if it was too well-done (I didn't even ask for it well done), apologized and took it back. The steak looked over cooked and shriveled. Manager Sean came & apologized and asked if I wanted a soup or salad to enjoy while I waited. I got a salad which was nice. The new steak took like 15 minutes to come out even after like 5 different servers came over and said it was on it's way & it was a top priority........ THE SECOND STEAK WAS STILL WELL DONE. Of course it would be well done if I waited 15 minutes for it. You had TWO chances to make a medium steak and failed so hard. What. The. Heck. My asparagus was sticking half off the plate because they brought my new meal on some dinky little plate. The asparagus was wayyy too salty and old. I tried to cut the old parts off but every time I did the top portion would fall off the plate. What a waste. The steak was tough and well done but I ate it. It was so tiny, maybe 6 oz? At that point I was so hungry and fed up that I lied to our waitress and said everything was fine when she came over. The only good part about my dish was the mashed potatoes. For $14 I could've gotten a nicer, bigger, and perfectly cooked steak from Texas Roadhouse. The waitress offered us a free pizookie to make up for the first mistake which was very kind of her. There was also a guy cleaning up the cups from tables and was clearly trying to carry too much on his tray because he ended up spilling it on himself and near another occupied table. He dropped the F-bomb and he wasn't very quiet about it. Kinda unprofessional. What a disappointing and unsatisfying experience at BJ's...

The second wing I had in one batch was cold still practically frozen in the middle. I advised the waiter and he said it was probably just the one wing and it didn't sit deep enough in the fryer when cooking and their distributor fully cooks the wings. He was extemely resistant to bringing a fresh batch. My friend then bites into one from the other order and discovers it is completely pink and uncooked so I asked for the manager. The manager was more useless than the waiter. He was a younger fellow with a trimmed beard. He had no concern for the chicken being undercooked nor our health being put at risk and kept blaming it again on the distributor. I argued with him that it's not the distributor because if they receive them fully cooked then they still aren't preparing them right because the inside should be warm and white not frozen and pink. He refused to work with us on the bill and only offered to comp the wings. He took the undercooked wing to ""provide feedback"" for his cooks even though we requested to keep it as evidence.

We also ordered their triple pazookie platter for dessert.  You can't go wrong when ordering a pazookie.  & For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, let me edge-ah-muh-cate you on it real quick.  Basically you get a freshly baked, still in the cooking dish, warm & gooey cookie topped w/a scoop of ice cream!  Dessert doesn't get much better than that.  They have a variety of cookie types to choose from: I went w/the white chocolate chip & macadamia nut.  I think the others in my party chose chocolate chip & triple chocolate, which is a chocolate cookie w/chocolate chips.  My MIL, who ordered the chocolate chip cookie requested chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla.  When the pazookies arrived to our table, they were VERY gooey....in fact, I'd say they were basically uncooked in the center.  Not really what you should expect, as the cookie really should be cooked all the way through.  Even though the cookie was not cooked all the way, who doesn't love eating cookie dough?  Which means I still ate it all up!! Overall, the food was good.  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar either.  I would still come here occasionally, but the hubby said he doesn't think he'll come to this location anymore.....mostly due to the no ground beef on his pizza thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=240,3.4,3.26,3.152,3.2440000000000007,3.3160000000000003

Last weekend I took my boys to the BJ's at Arden for lunch last Saturday. I'd been to this location 1-2 other times, and always on the weekend. BJ's was filled as usual, with guests in the main areas as well as those in the bar section. Our wait for a table was only about 15 so while we waited ,we watched the Giants game from one of the MANY TV's they had in the establishment that was showing it. Once we sat and were given our menus, and we got our drinks first. Then I noticed they were advertising their new appetizer, the 'Honey Sriracha Roasted Brussel Sprouts'. From the picture they looked grilled, so I decided to check them out. I also ordered their 16oz sirloin steak with grilled asparagus a small Cesar salad. My oldest son got the Brewhouse burger as he always does and my youngest got the chicken tenders and fries....like he always does! :) My salad arrived first which was a fairly decent size for a side salad....and then the Honey Sriracha Roasted Brussel Sprouts came. WOW! these were hands down, one of the best appetizers that I've ever had here. I went into ordering them not knowing what to expect, and I left wanting to find out how to make them (which I did). There were so many different tastes and smells going on in just this dish, there was a creamy, sweet and spiciness to the sauce because of the honey and Sriracha combination. Mixed in with a smokiness from the grilled outer layer of the Brussel Sprouts, plus a little bite from the Brussel Sprouts themselves. That plus the cesar salad was a good start to my main dish. The sirloin was cooked perfectly, and it paired well with the grilled asparagus. With the appetizer, and salad to start my meal off. I purposely saved half of my steak and asparagus for dinner, and so I could leave room for dessert. And I decided to have the 'BJ's Baked Beignet', which was amazing. Imagine bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream.....yea exactly! You get this mixture of a warm cinnamon'y donut and cold creamy vanilla ice cream, topped with ripened strawberries in a sweet strawberry sauce! Overall it was one of the best pairings of meals that I've had at BJ's, which is saying a lot since I've probably eaten here at a minimum once a month.

My only complaint was my burger was WAY over cooked. It was bad. I actually think my burger was microwaved because the inside was really really hot, not the cooked on a stove hot but microwaved hot. I should have said something but I didn't care enough to. My suggestion is to order your burger or mean medium. I'm sure it would have been much better.  Overall I really enjoyed our lunch.

647,Angie O.,"Woodland, CA",30,41,23.0,4.0,2015-11-19,"This particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is one of my favorite because it is pretty much attached to the Arden Fair Mall. I usually like to end my shopping with a nice meal from BJ's, and I've made it kind of routine at this point. Obviously, BJ's is a chain restaurant. That ALONE will deter your average hipster from giving this place a visit but it's really one the few chains I continue to visit, and for good reasons.  Their menu is extensive. I'm a fan of simpler menu's, but I like that there is something for everyone (salads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, steak, etc.) and they have really expanded on their enLIGHTened (healthier) menu options. The pizza here is pretty good, I really like that they have thin crust options and you can also ""build your own"" pizza. Their sandwiches are also yummy and I would suggest you get Wedge Cut Fries with any burger or sandwich because they are seriously a better choice. They have a large selection of Brews (hence the name) and I love that every season they have a variety of season-inspired drinks.   Service. It can be hit or miss but for the most part it is average. Average as in attentive but not annoying, informative but not pushy. I've had both good and mediocre experiences with service but never a bad one, so I'd say that's a plus. TIP: If the host or hostess seat you in a spot where you don't want to sit, speak up, they usually have no problem with letting you sit where you want, and won't give you that sarcastic ""SURE"" (that is a big PLUS, for me)  Ambiance- Casual. It can get loud but not bothersome. The #1 reason I keep coming back: THOSE PZOOKIES!!. A warm delicious cookie of your choice topped with creamy Ice Cream?? Delicious!!

We stopped going to Elk Grove for the reason of bad service. Soo it all started with our order from the beginning. We asked for extra chicken not a crazy request obviously at a extra charge. Our server didn't seem to like that. So only three waters at a table of four, not logical but maybe the fourth one was coming. Hmm no it wasn't. Let's kindly request. Oh yea I'll get one right now. Few mins goes by i see our server walk by a few times. No water. Hmm okay! One salad comes out all alone without the extra chicken. Maybe it's coming with the other salads, all the other salads roll out no extra chicken and still no water. Server walks by I'm checking on that extra chicken I sarcastically say thanks for the water. Oh I'm sooo sorry I'll bring it out now. He comes back finally with a pitcher to refill the other waters. Hmm excuse me but I have no cup, still no extra chicken we are done eating and now ask for the bill in pure annoyance. 10-15 mins pass with him telling us he is trying to get the extra chicken taken off because only a manager can do it. We are beyond unhappy and go to front to try to pay. Oh sorry sir you can't pay here we will try to get your check. 5 mins past finally a check. We proceed to pay up front. Then a manager by the name of Amy, approaches us and asks us is everything okay? Out of frustration we respond actually it's not. We come here a lot at least 3 times a week. Her response is I work 5 days a week I've never seen you here. Is 3 times a week not enough? Even if it was my first time that is a not a response I expected from someone of a manager position. I then proceeded to ask for her name and she decided to spell it out! A-M-Y or AMIE! Her loud tone of voice and border line screaming was heard to really grasp the exact letters! Wow bad service from the server and the manager. I'm not surprised because  BAD SERVICE COMES FROM BAD MANAGEMENT. Please save yourself the humiliation and feeling as if your presence isn't appreciated and visit another BJs or avoid this entire chain of restaurants as Amy has left me no option.  No food is good enough to have to go through this type of service.

Which finally the server walked our check up to us and walked away... So no we want to pay and no one is at the register so a lady walks up and she's like ""can I help you"" we said we want to pay and leave and then she asks ""is everything ok, I'm the manager"" And we start to tell her what happen and we tell her we come here all the time which we really do at least 3 times a week... Then the ""manager"" says I'm here 5 days a week and I never see you guys here! What kind of response is that? She's basically is saying we are lying.... And she wants to argue with us... We next said excuse me what did you say we really come in here all the time  Then we ask for her name and aggressively she says Amy! And spells it out for us A-M-Y! I was so disgusted I couldn't believe this was the manager talking to customers like that....  I will not go back here again....

Not the best place to sit at because 1. we felt neglected from our waiter, he only saw us 3 times. My friend had to flag down a different waitress.  We ordered 2 drinks. I forgot what my friend ordered but it had to with peach and I ordered the Royal soda Cream soda drink. I am sorry I forgot the name of the drinks we ordered but I remember both drinks were strong. That's when we tried to flag down our waiter to bring us water and cream soda for it to help with how strong our drink was. It took quite awhile for him to come around but instead he never did so therefore that's when we had to flag down the waitress, haha. It's just disappointing to neglect your customers):  We also ordered chips and spinach artichoke dip which was good! The calamari we ordered wasn't crispy at all, it was on the soft side but we are still thankful :) it was just a different texture in our mouth.  The pizookie we ordered was cookies n Creme! Wawow!

17,William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1745,1258,9492.0,3.0,2016-01-06,"After coming to the Elk Grove, Natomas, and the Roseville locations, I decided to pay a visit to this national restaurant chain called, ""BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse"" at Arden Way. I usually come to that place for quite some times, and I'm likely satisfied for this effort! Located outside Arden Fair Mall, BJ's has it all delivering their wonderful entrees, appetizers, drinks, and desserts to enjoy dining pleasures. The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most BJ's does. However, this place is quite smaller here despite the location which it attached to the mall, yet it does have some good, average space to dine in and heading to the bar side too. The employees are doing a good job here despite the environment of how busy it is. I'm sure they need to re-improved the customer service easier to make this place more reliable and motivated. Now onto the food! On 7/1/2015, I decided to ordered a happy hour appetizer meal: the chicken pot stickers and a glass of BJ's Blonde Ale. So far, the pot stickers tasted very good! The dippable sauce for the pot stickers did work the flavors too. The BJ's Blonde also tasted not bad at all for this light beer! Very crisp and bold for that ale! The next visit, on 1/5/2016, my father and I were visiting to the same place for an another try by redeeming their ""Buy One, Get One (BOGO) Free"" promotion offer during the lunch peek hours. We decided to ordered a Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl and a Lemon Thyme Chicken. As we ate it, the food is simply not bad. The Salmon Quinoa tasted good which it makes the seasoning very balanced. The Lemon Thyme Chicken is also tasted delicious too although it did add some salt a little bit as I continued to eat. I wish this plate needs to reduced the sodium content next time. Otherwise, it's a good, fine meal for lunch! There's tons of parking spaces available right outside Arden Fair Mall, so you can park anywhere you want near or far. All in all, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse at Arden Way is a good national restaurant chain that I really enjoyed dining here.

636,Ashley P.,"Sacramento, CA",5,9,1.0,2.0,2016-02-12,"I have always been a fan of BJ's Brewhouse, but I will never go to the one at the Arden location again! My husband and I were extremely disappointed with our experience. We went there at 6:30 PM last Friday night. It was pretty busy, but we were told we could sit in the bar where there were open booths and tables. We sat down and it took several minutes before anyone came to us, which we figured it was OK because it was a Friday night. A server with a blond ponytail finally came with menus and I immediately ordered our drinks because she seemed like she was in a rush; however, she went to the next table where she must have known the people because she took her time to talk to them for a few minutes. It was close to 10 minutes before we received our drinks and our server passed by us a few times without saying anything. When the drinks finally came she made a remark about the wait being over and looked like she was about to take off again, so my husband quickly told her that we wanted to order our food. My salad came out first, but my husband's Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts appetizer did not come out for a while. When they did, they were charred and burnt to the point that they disintegrated in your mouth. We've gotten this dish before and the brussels sprouts should still be green and intact, unlike these ones that were burnt to a crisp. After that, our server was nowhere to be found. My husband finally asked another server to take back the dish and to please get us a new one that wasn't so burnt. After a while our server came back with the Brussels Sprouts, rolled her eyes and said ""Here you go. These should be better"", but they looked like the same exact dish! The server took off before we could say anything. We decided to enjoy our pizza instead (which wasn't all that great), but knew I did not want to pay for these brussels sprouts because they were no better than the last one. When we were done with our pizza we waited a while for server to come back, but she was nowhere to be found. Our drinks had also been empty for quite some time so by the time she came to check on us my husband was irritated and asked for a box and the bill. She brought us our bill, saw that we had two slices of pizza left and said ""gee I guess you didn't really need a box"" and walked away. Ready to leave, I checked our bill which charged us for BOTH of the Brussels Sprouts dishes.  At this point I got up and asked the front hostess if we could speak to the manager. We explained to the manager that we weren't happy with the dish and that our server was constantly disappearing. He apologized and said that the dish was one of his favorites and that it shouldn't look anything like that. He let us know that he would talk to the cook and that we would not have to pay either dish. He took our plates then our server came out with the revised check and was clearly annoyed that we spoke to her manager. Before I could even reach for my card she hurried off. We waited for her to collect our payment, but she was once again nowhere to be found, so we flagged down the manager. My husband mentioned that we could never find the sever when we needed her and that she seemed annoyed every time she did come by our table. He apologized again and rang up our bill. My husband was so irritated with the experience that he went to wait outside while I signed my receipt. As I got up from the booth the server finally came back and gave me a very fake smile which I did not return. We appreciated the manager's diligence, assisting us with our bill, and for taking responsibility; however, the food and service were so poor that we will not return. I really hope he spoke to the server too. I'm not going to blame her for everything that happened, since the kitchen burnt our food, but we were never rude to her nor did we do anything to cause her to treat us like she did.

The service was horrendous! Our server came to our table right away to take our drink order and as we were waiting for our drinks, other tables that came in after we did got their drinks a good 5 to 10 minutes before we did. And the same goes for our food. Once we got our food, our server came back only once to check on how our food was and asked if we wanted another drink. When we asked for water, they were dropped off at our table without a word. The fish and chips I ordered were over cooked to the point of being almost burnt. When we asked for boxes, she returned a short time later with them and tossed them on our table and again no words spoken. And instead of dropping off our check when she brought over our boxes, she walked away as if she were expecting us to order dessert even after we told her we were not. There were no thank yous or any other words spoken at a higher than a mumble. Overall, I have never been so disappointed in the service or food at this establishment in my life.

I'm not sure what her deal was but the way she was responding to my friend, whom is African American, did not seem pleasant.

I believe it was Johanna...but could be mistaken. She was awesome. She had a very calm demeanor and did a wonderful job as our waitress. It's not easy serving a big party. Having a big family, we often eat out with a party of 15 and often times you can see and sense the frustration of waiters/waitresses when asking for things. But not once did she seem overwhelmed, which I'm sure she may have very well been. She always had a smile and checked often if we needed anything. Her service was greatly appreciated.

I like there clam chowder bread bowls, deep dish pizzas, and the flat breads a lot. My favorite flat bread is the california club because its so good and the size is pretty decent whether its being ordered as an appetizer for the whole table or a light entree for yourself. They also have a lot of other different types of flat breads to choose from too. The deep dish pizzas are also really good too especially the chicken bacon ranch one! The service at night is okay, its just that they're not as attentive since i think theres less workers at night but its still good.

Starting with the atmosphere, it is just fun. If you are a sports fan, there are TV's galore that will most likely be showing something that you are interested in. If you aren't into the sports showing, BJ's delivers a dim, very adult feeling dining area that is fun to get together with your friends and just have a good night out. The food is fantastic! The menu ranges the from build your own pizza section to delicious burgers, to fancier fare such as the pastas and steaks. Everything that I have tried, I have always been happy with. Although I do not drink, I would fail this review if I did mention the huge selection of various adult beverages. If you can't find something to drink here, you may be too hard to please. The final thing to mention is the service. I have always had great experiences when I visit. The host/hostesses at the front are always smiling and helpful, even when busy. The wait staff is very attentive and also always smiling. Your drinks rarely get to the bottom, and the food is delivered quickly. What else can you ask for?

And being my second time around at this location, I thought my experience would have been somewhat better...But it wasn't .  So, we decided to stop by for drinks, app and a Pazooki ( I think it's spelled), Being it was a Monday evening and the weather was perfect for dining out on the patio. Well, as we were approached by the host we politely asked him if we could have a table out on the patio. It wasn't busy and it was only the two of us. So, he says he has to go get the waiter to seat us (Odd, I thought that was HIS job?) So as that left us confused and he disappears. Another house with an abrupt look on her face asked if we been helped. We stated yes, but...(Oh, yea she said Ok, swung her hair and turned her back on us as we were still talking to her.) Excuse me.... So the original host comes back and says, he can't sit us on the patio because the waiter has a large party (Table of probably 6 people) in the inside dining area.... WTF?! We are all kinds of confused at this point. So, we opt to sit inside the super cold dining area. That's phase one. So now we're seated, and we wait another 10 minutes before we are greeted by our waitress. So that's about 20 minutes wait time so far. Luckily she had a bubbly personality because I was going to say something about the wait. We order our drinks and ordered a side of fries because at this point we are just over it. The drinks come, my Margarita is full of ice. If I wanted a cup of ice, I would have asked for one. And my partner ordered some new Champagne drink, that looked nothing like the pic. Horrible presentation. And the sad part he had to send it back and tell them how to make their own drink. Like really? Who is running this place? Now the fries come out......So I guess someone ordered the friend and didn't want them so they set out till someone else ordered them and lucky us we got them. They were burnt, but felt uncooked... So we sent them back, then they come back with a higher stack of fries. Then the waiter says, they felt bad so they gave us more.. Nooo... you but more fries on top of the old because the top few fries were hot and the bottom were colder. I'm getting pissed off all over again. So that was a fail. Then I thought I give the Margarita a second try. But in a Margarita glass. Just another glass of ice. I'm so irritated cuz now these people are playing with my money. The Pazooki has arrived, and we're like ok this looks good. My spoon can't break through the cookie.... Hat's off!. Did they really send us a burnt cookie. Which I take it the manager took off the bill. But hell, everything we had was a mess.  I don't know what's going on with this BJ's but they need a major overhaul.

163,Marissa J.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",149,25,21.0,4.0,2016-06-07,"I have always enjoyed coming to BJs. I enjoy coming to this location in particular because it is located right next to Arden Fair Mall, which is incredibly convenient. However, it is significantly smaller than all of the other BJs locations I have been to, though the service is typically fast, so the smaller size does not affect the speed of service. I always love coming here when they have their 2 for $25 deal going on. For $25, you each get either a small house salad, Caesar salad, wedge salad (my personal favorite), or any soup, plus any medium Deep Dish or Tavern-Cut pizza, and of course a Pizookie, which is what BJs is known for - their large oven-baked cookie topped with ice cream. I usually always get the Cookies 'n' Creme Pizookie, but they have a ton of flavors to choose from. If you're indecisive, you can get the Pizookie Trio, which is three mini Pizookies and you can mix and match the flavors. Another tip I've learned is that they can make a Pizookie half and half. In the past, I have ordered a Pizookie that was half Cookies 'n' Creme and half Chocolate Chunk. Overall, I enjoy eating at BJs and will definitely continue coming to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=140,3.24,3.24,3.312,2.7359999999999998,3.2400000000000007

Took it out of my mouth, and it was a piece of cardboard! But I didn't make it a big deal about it cause I was happy that at least it wasn't human hair or a bug, so I continued eating.  When I got home, I felt really sick. I thought it was the mojito kicking in, so I decided to go to sleep.  The next morning(today) at 7am, I had horrible (sorry)diarrhea, and threw up ALL the spaghetti out. As of right now(12:13pm), I'm still having to use the bathroom.

50,an l.,"San Jose, CA",90,188,283.0,3.0,2016-10-25,"Dropped in for lunch as it was a convenient location in the mall. I really wanted to eat at the Nordstrom cafe(my fave) but it was prime time lunch hour and the wait was a bit long.  After spending all my money on shoes and clothes I didn't need, I got hungry and to my surprise, absolutely no wait at BJs. Since it was raining, I wanted the chicken tortilla soup. Being that I was also running errands all day, I figured I also needed some carbs in me so I ordered a lunch size California flatbread pizza. My friend ordered the half California club sandwich and the tortilla soup also. I wasn't impressed but the size of his ""lunch size"" California club. The menu said half of the regular size... he got one wedge. He also asked for wedge fries and got shoe string fries.  The server that brought our food out dropped it and left, so we couldn't tell her the fries were wrong. Our waitress never checked on us either so we just ate what we had. The chicken tortilla soup didn't taste as good as the BJs in Elk Grove. This one was a lot thicker and one small cube of avocado. The server never came to check on us... only when we asked for the bill. Considering more than half the tables were empty at the bar where we sat, I would expect better service.  I'm going to stick with Nordstrom cafe next time for better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=80,2.96,3.19,3.26,2.9560000000000004,3.098

I like the fact you can reserve a time to dine in or pick up and once you check in at the front they state making your order immediately! In this case we dined in. We were greeted seated and 5 mins later our appetizers came out.  I ordered the BLT salad and my honey ordered the Potato skins. I really enjoyed the salad the bacon was crispy and the dressing was delicious. 15 mins later out 2 pizzas came out I ordered the Chicken Philly Pizza it was different yet good they use a Sriracha cheese sauce  in place of tomato sauce. The veggies on it was so greedy as well and had great flavor. The second Pizza was half Great White and Chicken Bacon Ranch. The great white was okay nothing special but, the Chicken Bacon Ranch had to be my absolute favorite. The pizza was nice and crispy and had lots of flavor down to the crust having great flavor that the other Pizzas lacked.  For the restaurant to be as busy as it was our waiter was still very attentive and made sure or refills of water never totally empty. Next time I'm going to check out BJ's for there happy hour drinks and eats. They also have a nice full bar with plenty of TV's to watch the game which is a huge plus.

47,Douglas J.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,3,1.0,1.0,2016-11-07,"I went to this restaurant on Tuesday Nov 1 2016. My experience was terrible. The hostess was rude & had zero personality. She seemed upset that I asked for a table instead of a booth. She told me the wait would be 10 minutes. After almost 25 minutes of waiting and seeing people who came after myself & my dinner guest get seated before us. I asked her if she had forgotten us. She said we had to wait because we requested a table. When we finally got seated the waitress came after several minutes and took our order. It wasn't unusually busy & I noticed several empty tables. I ordered a bacon burger & with BBQ sauce on the side & a dinner salad. The salad came with out an issue. A gentleman (not our waitress) brought our entrees to the table. I noticed immediately that my burger was brought to me without the French fries that should have accompanied it. The gentleman said that they noticed I had an onion allergy. They informed me that they fry their French fries in the same oil as their onion rings and were concerned for my allergy. I appreciated that but asked him why they didn't ask me sooner? Why not ask me before they cooked my burger. I informed him that I wouldn't have an issue with the fries & he went back to the kitchen to have them made. So there I sat with my burger without the BBQ sauce I had requested. I waited for our waitress so I could get the BBQ sauce, but she didn't come. My friend began to eat because I didn't want his food to get cold like my burger was becoming! When our waitress finally brought the BBQ sauce along with my fries I discovered my fries were STONE COLD!!!  Very upsetting. They offered to re cook my food, but my friend was almost done eating! They offered to bring me dessert. Why would I want dessert when I haven't eaten dinner. I payed for my salad & my friends meal. We left! I was hungry & very much disappointed in my experience.

I always get one to share.  The crisp crust and fresh ingredients will make these a highlight of the meal.  I normally get a seasonal entree. I have had butternut soup, seasonal salads, seared ahi and the ever popular braised tacos.  The tacos are not quite traditional, but ever so tasty.

It is a very convenient location, especially when you don't feel like eating junk at the mall.  Last night I ordered the spicy chicken soba noodles and they were actually really good. The only downside was the portion they served me was so small that I was still hungry after (which usually never happens).

The staff were extremely helpful and nice, but holy hell did I have a problem with their food today.  I was pretty crunched on time today since I had to drop off my iPhone at the Apple Store for a battery replacement and then had to go back to work immediately after. I looked up some restaurants at the mall and decided, ""Hey, why NOT go to BJ's?""  Well, today's visit answered that question pretty clearly. I was helped pretty promptly by one of the folks at the take-out counter, and she offered a few suggestions. I eventually decided on the Bacon Cheeseburger and the Potstickers to bring back to the office to eat. I ordered the food and made my way over to the Apple Store while I waited on my food. By the time I dropped off my phone, the food was ready and I gave my thanks and departed to work.  I gave the potstickers to my co-worker as I ate the bacon cheeseburger while I was working. About half-way through, I looked at the burger and realized I made a huge mistake. The inside of the burger was not cooked at all. I've had my fair share of medium-rare burgers in my day, and this was not that. After work, I made my way back to Arden Fair to pick up my iPhone and made a stop at BJ's again before I left. I brought the remains of the burger and showed it to a different person at the take-out counter and she said, ""Yeah! Medium-rare is supposed to be undercooked like that!"" That's when I took inspiration from my hero, Gordon Ramsay, and used my hands and opened up that patty to reveal the insides. She got the manager, and I asked very specifically whether the medium-rare burgers were supposed to look like that, and he agreed that many parts of the patty appeared uncooked. He took down my name, phone number, and e-mail to get a voucher for a replacement burger. (I was sent a $25 gift voucher from BJ's) I'm not sure whether I'll take them up on their offer for another burger; I haven't even gotten the voucher yet, but if it's going to make me feel nauseous again, no thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=20,3.4,3.24,3.3,2.5320000000000005,3.3040000000000007

Staff start blaming each other and the manager was involved. People saying they are going to call out because the didn't get the day off. I get having disagreements and needing to hash things out. But seriously right in front of us? It could have happened in a place more appropriate. It was so distracting we had stopped our conversation because the argument was vocal enough to were we had forgotten what we were talking about. So we patiently waited for them to be done so we could ask for boxes. But instead our waiter stormed off and once again ignored us. We asked a different waiter, paid our ticket and got out as soon as possible.  I have never had such an awkward restaurant experience. I hate the fact that we did because I really liked the food.

We were just walking around - killing time - when we happened upon the BJ's Restaurant. I am a fan of BJ's Restaurants. We are regulars at the one in Downey in Southern California. Tuesdays are the best days there because they have Half Price Wine - ALL DAY. But anyway we walked in and bellied up to the bar. We were greeted within seconds by a pleasant and cheery Bartender by the name of Rachael. We chatted briefly and she took our beverage order. Rachael recommended the Piranha Pale Ale for me and my friend had some berry flavored cider drink. Our beverages were promptly served. The beer was nicely chilled and very tasty. Not too hoppy - just like she said.  She returned within a couple of minutes to offer us some food - which we declined. We just stopped in for a beverage. She was busily performing her BT duties but managed to spend a couple minutes here and there having conversation with us. Whilst sitting there we met a very nice gentleman named Jonathon.

The first evening I was given an estimate of 5-10 minutes for a table but the actual wait ended up being about 30 minutes. Service on both evenings was spotty with drink refills slow on the first night and non-existent on the second.  I've also found that the quality of food varies surprisingly from location to location. In the greater Sacramento area, Roseville is tops, Natomas is at the bottom (got sick eating there), and Arden is somewhere in the middle. In regards to meat, be aware that medium = well done. On my second night eating here, once I informed my server that my table was just having dessert (having already eaten dinner at a restaurant down the street), she quickly became short. Once the order was placed she did not return to check on us again. I couldn't finish the sweet and salty dessert due to water running dry.  Don't know that I'll go to this particular BJ'S again.

We were part of a volleyball tournament near the Cal Expo Center. Apparently, there was a prom near by and they, as well, had many parties as well. I arrived later to my party of 24 guest. Our tables were split between the parents & adults and girls volleyball players. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and pizza. I was never with an empty glass. Our server kept the refills coming. I can't imagine I how many other other glasses he had to tend to. They were all dressed clean and looked very proper to serve. All our food came in a timely manner and just about the same time for each person. Our table was tended by several servers and each and everyone of them handled all our special request regardless if it was their main table; more refills, extra plates, more dressing, milk, utensils, etc. This was the most impressive thing, great customer service. FOOD: The only challenge we had was the 5 Meat Pizza I ordered. It was a bit on the salty for my taste. It could of been caused by the bacon. But it was still hot and fine to eat. EXTRA: Aside the food, we were able to serve a cake specially made by one of the parents. The servers even provided plates and forks for us. With all the big parties there, the table configuration still gave us ample room to surround the birthday girl and sing happy birthday to her.​ At the end, when the bill came, they were able to split the bill and pair them up with each parent & child.

When I entered, the place was busy, happy, and noisy. I wasn't big on the noise, but there was a nice table available, and the service was friendly, helpful, and prompt throughout. The food and the beer (I had a red ale) were just OK. I had some sort of ""healthy"" stir fry dish, that probably wasn't all that good for me. The menu gives you the calories of everything, which ended up causing menu choice paralysis and choosing the best of the worst.

8,Jess H.,"Redding, CA",0,4,2.0,1.0,2017-05-29,"I typically love BJ's ever since I started working at the Arden Mall. It's my favorite place to go with my kids, whenever we have family in town or when I want an ice cold Blonde. I normally have great service from Mike or Athena up in the bar. My 30th birthday was this passed weekend of course I chose to have my birthday dinner there. I called on May 19th to see if they could accommodate a reservation of 20 at 7pm. The girl called me back and said her manager was able to do so.  When we arrived on the 27th at 7pm the hostess said they had no reservation. After explaining to her the situation she got her manager. The manager was extremely rude, pretty much called me a liar. He stated they had no reservation for us and that they would have never made a reservation on a Saturday night for 20 people. I then pulled up my call log and showed him where I called and received a call back. I also googled their location number to assure I called the correct location.  If I were him I would be scrubbing my previous schedule to see who was working during the time I called. He then said we could wait to see if they had any tables or we could go somewhere else. He was very concerned on how many of my party was actually there and ready to be sat if they could accommodate us. We had 14 currently there. He took me to the section where he was going to seat us to see if it was okay. It was going to be an end booth and a long table at the end of booth. This seemed like it would okay.  When the two hostesses sat us we were sat in two booths that were separated, 7 people in each, however, our reservation was for 20. Another group, in a booth was in between us. We were all very confused as this isn't what the manager had just shown me. The first hostess tossed the menus on the table before anyone even sat down. And instead of asking anyone to be seated she said ""I don't know why you all are staring at me!"" The other hostess kept insisting that this was all they could do and this where her boss told her to seat us. Meanwhile the middle of the section where we were going to be sat had three long tables that were unattended. The hostess said we could not sit there because it was for a reservation of 30 at 8pm. Wait a minute....I thought you don't make reservations like that?!?! I said ""this is ridiculous, I've never had such horrible service, we're just going to leave!"" The hostess kept saying, ""that's fine you can leave!"" I replied that she could shut up at anytime As she had a horrible attitude since we walked in and acted like we were an inconvenience to her. She was standing there not inviting us to sit or seeing if there was a possible better solution. Did I mention they were not busy and there was no one else on the wait list.  The tables weren't together, they would have never accommodated a party of 20 in the two booths, and they let a regular walk out of their establishment unsatisfied. The bottom line is we were there and whether we had a reservation or not they should have sat us together. The manager didn't even try to approach us again on the way out. I will never go back because of this horrible service. We instead went back to my house and ordered Mountain Mikes and it ended up being a much better choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3?start=40,3.48,3.18,3.256,2.5320000000000005,3.3000000000000007

We never received the call so we walked back to the desk and they said oh we can seat you now. We probably could've gotten seated earlier had we not walked out into the mall. The waitress approached us immediately after we were seated and took our orders. We were on a specific time frame and she said that would not be a problem. Fast forward 45 minutes when our food finally arrived at our table. The food was warm not hot. Therefore it had probably been sitting and she had not picked it up and brought it to us. We had approximately 10 minutes to eat cold food. There was plenty of waitstaff and the restaurant was not even completely full. I understand lunch hours are busy but I feel like the service was marginal at best. I was very disappointed. I left a tip but not nearly as high as I usually tip.

I've being going to BJs for years and the food and drinks, food, and pizookie are always pretty much the same, the service is really what makes the difference. The only reason why I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because of the location. It's at the mall, parking is awful, and it gets pretty packed. Other than that my experience here was great.  Service - the service was good. We luckily were able to snag a table in the bar area since the place was so packed. our waiter was very attentive. He even made recommendations for drinks and pizookie flavors.  Drinks - there are a wide variety of beers on tap, wine, and specialty cocktails! My personal favorite is the Jeremiah red! It's malty and has a pretty high alcohol content for a beer.  Food - there is a wide variety of American foods ranging from pizzas, burgers, flat breads, steak, and pastas. Pizzas and burgers are always a solid choice when coming to a BJs.  For an appetizer, we ordered a small bites trio or couscous Mac and cheese, garlic Parmesan carrots, and ginger creamed corn. And let me say OMG get the couscous Mac and cheese! 'Nuff said! For my main entree, I ordered the jalapeño burger which was great! I'm not too keen on spiciness, but this was a manageable spicy. The heat went away and it wasn't one of those long lasting spiciness.  Dessert - PIZOOKIs!

Our waters took at least 15 minutes to get to us. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip since we figured it would take awhile to get our food. When that came it tastes like cream of broccoli soup. Extremely thin, and while I do like cream of broccoli soup, it was pretty lame for spinach artichoke dip. Our main courses came. My rice was hard, chicken was overlooked and Brussels sprouts had too much balsamic vinaigrette.. they were purple. French fries I stole from my boyfriend were amazing. And my friends spicy peanut noodle thing was good too. So most of the food was good.. just not mine I guess. We ended the night with some pizzookies and they were great as always.

Our stakes arrived seriously under cooked mine ordered medium, was served rare and my wife's ordered well done came medium. After a 20 minute re-fire time, my steak came medium well and my wife's sides were changed saying they were out of carrots. The manager came to help resolve the issues but still, the night spiraled down. 45 minutes for dessert, the bill and one more entree( ordered with dessert, and came out 15 minutes after the dessert) the server picks up my card and now 15 minutes passed to get it back.

I went with my friend this evening and when we put in our name we were told it should only be about ten minutes. After thirty minutes we decided we should check seeing as all of the people who had come in after us were already seated. As it turns out they forgot to put in our name. Accidents happen and we were promptly seated. Our server immediately came up and introduced himself and took our drink orders (just water since we had not yet had a chance to glance over the menu) which he quickly returned with. A few minutes later a gentleman turned up with two more waters looking confused at the water already sitting on the table, it was obvious there had been a miscommunication somewhere. Oh well, four waters isn't a problem, it's important to stay hydrated right? Then another gentleman (the only reason I gave two stars and not one) showed up to take our order and explained he was filling in for our server. We ordered an appetizer and a pizza. Our original server brought out the appetizer but no plates. We waited and waited. I finally had to go hunt down plates myself. When I returned our pizza was being dropped and then finally plates. I felt terrible when the ""fill in"" server saw our untouched (and now cold) appetizer and pizza and apologized for them coming out at the same time after we had requested the appetizer first. I explained he was not at fault and we dug into our cold avocado egg rolls where my friend immediately found an avocado belly button. We tried to laugh it off but it was getting harder to do so by this point. Next the pizza. It didn't have any sauce on it. We explained to our server that it was dry and didn't appear to have sauce and he offered ranch dressing. No apology. No offer to remake it. We ate one price and decided it was time for dessert.

If I ever have to express my concern I usually do so in store but this day I was so worn out from work that I didn't have the time or energy being that it was later in the evening, Our server was named Patricia and she was cold, rude, and seemed as if we were bugging her. We ordered an appetizer, pizza, and pizookie. The appetizer was delish, but when our pizza came I noticed it had tomatoes  which we asked to be excluded. As soon as I mentioned it to her she grabbed the pizza, rolled her eyes, and didn't say one word, no apology, no ""I will be right back,"" nothing. After about 15-20 mins (which was expected since we figured they would have to make a new pizza) she returned with the same pizza and it was obvious that they only removed the tomatoes instead of making a new one.....it was cold and dry as if it was sitting in a warmer. Again I didn't complain, but when she never returned to ask how we were doing that is where my issue is, we were without water and needed refills but she was no where to be found, and I also noted she only had 2 other tables. Finally when she returned she brought us a box and we ordered dessert. It look 18 minutes for our pizookie to come out! The table next to us had ordered and received  their food before our dessert even came out! Once we got up and asked for the check she ran our credit card at the table and said she would return with the receipt. We watched her go talk to other workers, hug a friend that came in and chat at the micro before returning with our credit card slip!

We happened to get sat before their arrival, wonderful we can get a couple drinks and order our appetizer while we wait for them. Our waitress shows, takes our drink order, a Dr Pepper for myself and an 805 for the man, we also ask for the Poke appetizer. She asked if we wanted it started then, we say Yes. She brings back the waters and my Dr Pepper and says she'll be right back with his beer. At least 15 minutes passes, our guests join the table, our waitress shows again, to ask for their drink order, still no 805, she says she'll check on that for him. We order two more cocktails and a fancy root beer at this time, and she says the poke should be right out. She brings the 805, two cocktails and no rootbeer. ""the keg is flat"". Ok.. we order dinner, still NO appetizer, I order a pasta and added a caeser salad, everyone else orders, she disappears. About 5 minutes later, my salad comes out, still NO appetizer. At this point my husband leaves our group to tell her to go ahead and cancel the scoop of raw fish that has literally taken close to 45 minutes at this point. Dinner comes, my pasta isn't everything I hoped for, it's bland, cold, and mushy. After dinner we wait with dirty plates for what we assume is the check... Nope, not once, not twice, but THREE times she came back to ask if we wanted dessert. We said No, thank you, ALL 3 TIMES! So now our nice quick dinner with family turned into a 2 hour affair where we didn't even get our appetizer. The restaurant was not packed, it wasn't busy, many open tables. No table touch by management, EVER.  I even left the table under the guise of using the restroom to find the manager to try to get some assistance, and I wasn't able to locate one, although I didn't specifically ask for one.

I asked if the table could be bussed and they said, ""there is like only one busses here now sooooo..."". They look at me, dumb eyed and far too comfortable in their service position to clean a table. They then watched as I made 4 trips to buss the table myself. They never offered to help or did any actual work.  The actual service was painfully slow. We ended up leaving before our celebratory beer or birthday cookie arrived.  What was total bullshit is even though we weren't getting service and I saw other tables give up, there was no shortage of staff just leaning on walls chitchatting.

Today was it for me, and not the good kinda it. More evil like IT, the clown.  We arrived. Wait was supposed to be 25 mins. No Biggy since most wait at any BJs fall within the 20-50 min range.  Twenty mins in, the host told us there's a booth available and that we better run before it gets taken. Not sure why she said that because there were two booths available. Guessing she was just lazy and didn't want to walk us there, so we ended up menu-less for about 20 mins.  We were able to order a drink and an appetizer. 15 mins later the appetizer comes out and our server was still nowhere to be found. We had to get someone to call him.  Once we got his attention, I asked if we could please get the check because the service and the wait was beyond mediocre. We were starving! Took him five mins to bring us the check, which he rudely dropped off at our table. Another five mins later, He then asked us if we were going to eat it. We said no, box please. Then he started with an attitude on whether or not we wanted to speak with the manager, as if we were offending him. We weren't. We just wanted to leave to go eat somewhere more efficient.  Even with that, it took him another five mins to bring back our change and then another three for the box. Strange thing to do when you know someone wants to GTF out.  Yeah, so no more BJs at Arden for me. Ended up at Applebee's which I don't even like at all, but at least the service is way better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3,2.8,3.0,3.14,,2.9200000000000004

It had been 7 years the last time we tried this chain in another city. The special was to order $35 of food and get $10 off. Restaurant was busy, got sat down quickly and was waited on by Michael B. He was great, not to chatty, courteous and   recommended the hot wings. For drinks we got my ice tea and the mans Hefeweizen and later a Piranha Pale Ale. We ordered two appetizer's. One was the bone in chicken wings-hot and lemon Pepper flavored. The other was chips, salsa and guacamole. They were good, can't complain. For the main we ordered the deep dish medium pizza called, BJ favorite. It was really good pizza. The crust was crispy and not greasy and the vegetables were fresh! We mentioned just before ordering that we would use the special and at the end of dinner he mentioned that he would have to run that by the manger. We sat and waited a few minutes and thought maybe we would have issues. He came back showed the new total with $10 off! People forget that even with a coupon or Groupon used that one should tip based on the Original amount! Service industry is tough. The restaurant got really busy as we left with full tummies and good service.

My fiancé over heard an older lady say the same thing to her husband that Lydia was only talking to him and not even looking at her. Anyhow when we asked for the check she ignored me again and asked my fiancé if we are paying separate in a very unprofessional manner which we found very INSULTING cuz I'm sure it was pretty obvious that we are a couple if she didn't notice my ring.

Like your typical BJ's, the pizza, wings, and burgers never fail. I've always had a great experience here and have been satisfied with my meals.  Parking: It's in a mall -- so it could be a hit or miss depending on the time of the year.  Service: Getting seated at this place can range anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour and a half. This place is extremely popular. I would highly suggest leaving earlier if you plan to go during dinner time. Lunch time and happy hour are not as hectic.

20,EMilio R.,"Sacramento, CA",706,78,3588.0,5.0,2017-12-28,"A couple of hiccups that really worked out to my benefit in the end so you'll hear no complaints from me.  LOCATION: Inside the Arden mall to the left of the main entrance between forever 21 and seasons 52. DECOR: Now, I'm not a huge fan of BJ's Decor choices simply because everything is too shiny. The wood on the tables is too shiny to take pictures of the food properly. The lights are bright and some places and dark and others. It's weird. I just don't care for it. Probably because it's commercial and standard. FOOD: I had the Twisted BLT salad and the chicken tortilla soup for their lunch special. Everyday you can get unlimited soup and salad for $9.95 from about 11-3pm. STAFF: All chill and super nice. I never had to wait for my salad or soup. The salad and soup even came out before my mixed drink at the bar, but that's probably because the kitchen is real fast. I mean it was just salad and soup, but staff still gets the win on this one. EXPERIENCE: Everything was going great. I walk in bar seating is full so I wait maybe 7 minutes for a table to open up on the floor and am escorted by a host to sit in a booth. Now, the host had mentioned their mobile app and customer loyalty deal going on through the holidays which promised a free Pizookie with your first time use of the app. The Pizookie was one of the reasons I came here with my girlfriend who swears up and down that the Pizookie is to die for. I'm not much for sweets, but the few things I do like are chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream so when these two things makeup the Pizookie, I already knew it was a win. And it was free?! Oh you know your boy got down on that, but not before there were issues with the mobile app. We try to put in the discount code for our Pizookie and pay through the app, but the app will not update our order so all it showed was the price for the two free pizookies and none of the other stuff we ordered. So after some troubleshooting with our waitress we finally get the manager over and it's the same thing. The apps not working, we cannot pay and we have been here longer than we had planned for. That's when the manager makes the best decision he could have made and gives us our meal for free for all the hassle and that, my friends, was a good day. -- @theMilsEdition",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-3,3.28,3.12,3.16,,3.1840000000000006
