Melanie R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,,3.0,7/28/2017,"We have visited this Applebees twice. Food has been great, french onion soup really good. Service is mediocre, unless you sit in the bar. Young staff has loud personal conversations, whining and complaining in full view and earshot of customers. We spoke to the same manager both times we were there, he couldn't have cared less. Bar staff seemed professional, I recommend sitting there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Jason F.,"Appleton, WI",18,71,12,1.0,9/23/2017,Every time I go here my order gets messed up and our food takes 45mins from when we order to get to our table. Not worth it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Aspen H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/23/2017,"We're in town for a football game and we're fans of the opposing team. Upon arrival, we instantly got grieve for wearing our gear. Which is to be expected, we thought it was funny at first, but it continued to the point where our waitress, dawn, was just blatantly being rude about it. You should expect opposing fans to come in if you're connected to a hotel and be able to treat them with respect just like everyone else. We asked for things and didn't receive them. We're not picky people so it shouldn't be too hard. But we were told; ""it's just not our day."" When we left, we paid cash, they ran up to grab the tab like we were criminally going to dine and dash. A waitress that wasn't even ours said ""is the money all in there"" yes, and because we're good people we tipped accordingly which is frankly more than our waitress deserved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Sisi U.,"Appleton, WI",2,28,5,1.0,4/30/2017,"Giving this place one star. Came here for dinner and it was SUCH a waste of money. Not to mention the horrible service. The greeter, was an absolute rude a-hole. It kept taking the waiter 10 minutes to bring our drinks. He passed my table like 10 times and never asked if we needed water. We finally had to call him over and it took him 10 minutes to get a glass of water. No, it wasn't busy. The food was cold. We ordered spinach artichoke dip, the plate was HOT but the food was cold. I wish I would've gone elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Taylor Z.,"Appleton, WI",18,24,17,1.0,2/23/2017,"Terrible service. Went to Applebee's for date night, they were fairly slow for customers but we walked in and waited a bit to be seated. Once the host greeted us, she brought us to a booth way in the corner away from everyone, and that's where we sat for 20 mins waiting for our server. The tablet with games didn't even have a battery to call someone over. As we were walking out because no one acknowledged us, the same host that sat us glanced up and said ""have a good night"" without any memory of having sat us not long before. Will not be returning, and recommend others do not as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Meghan L.,"Appleton, WI",617,122,1384,3.0,5/7/2015,"Applebee's is a well-known chain that many enjoy visiting for the tasty appetizers and pub fair (spinach dip, chicken wings, nachos). The dishes tend to be on the heavier side so I don't visit often, but it's nice to see they added some lighter meal options that they dubbed the ""have it all"" meals - ""all the flavor all under 600 calories."" The Thai Shrimp Salad (390 calories) was a tasty salad made from an Oriental salad blend (Napa cabbage, red cabbage, romaine) that is tossed in a chili lime vinaigrette and topped with shrimp, wonton strips, peanut sauce and fresh cilantro. The salad was fresh and had good flavor, but was a little heavy on the lime flavor. Biggest disappointment with the salad is that the salad is served with cold cocktail shrimp which the hubby said ""kinda gross me out."" The salad would be significantly better if serve with grilled shrimp!  Our server was awesome - super attentive and quick to check on us, provide a refill, bring the check. I don't remember his name, but he's probably the best dressed server in the place wearing a tie (a la Barney Stinson).  Great service. Would just like to see a little improvement in the food quality of the main dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Rob B.,"Appleton, WI",13,12,,3.0,9/30/2016,Booth had large slit with stuffing coming put. Food was average. Riblets no longer offered on menu. Now i remember why we hadn't been here in two years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Timothy A. H.,"Appleton, WI",8,68,189,1.0,10/15/2014,"Really haven't been to Applebee's much over the years, but the few times I have, I was less than enthusiastic about the food. You can tell that nothing is made fresh, and probably most of the food is prepared in a microwave. The last time that I was there, I ordered a burger medium rare. When it came, it was well done. I sent it back and asked for it to be remade, it was again served to me well done. I inquired as to why it was so hard for the cook to make a medium rare burger, and was informed that it was difficult to cook a third pound burger medium rare. Really!?! I've been in the restaurant business for over 17 years, and its not hard at all. Save your money and go somewhere where quality food is made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Carolyn T.,"Riverside, IL",403,402,922,4.0,3/19/2013,"So, my boyfriend and I have come to this Applebee's many times for half-price appetizers, which are available after 10 PM 7 days a week. I have never ordered anything else off the menu before, so I can't vouch for the rest of the food, BUT those appetizers really have us coming back for more! We like ordering the appetizer platter, which has wings, quesadillas, mozzarella sticks, chips, and spinach artichoke dip. Obviously, this isn't the healthiest, but it's definitely yummy comfort food. Sometimes, you just feel like stuffing yourself with cheese on a weeknight! Nothing wrong with that.  Really, you cannot beat a deal like half-price appetizers. You get SO much food for like $6 and there is plenty to share with another person as a late meal (or second meal).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Joseph O.,"Canyon Country, CA",27,6,,2.0,2/14/2016,"Food ended up being free so they get two stars. We order to go food and when I showed up to get it they had brownie bits for me. Wtf! Are brownie bites and no I didn't order them. I waited at the host station before being greeted, the hostess sat a couple being greeting me. The couple arrived 5 minutes after I did. I was told to go food is picked up at the bar after explaining to her it was rude she sat the couple before even acknowledging me. Then asked the bar tender for my food and he didn't have my order.. so while I waited I asked for a shot.. never got the shot of alcohol. The manager approaches me and asked what he can do .. I tell him and don't see him again. Another guy calls me by name over to his station and tell me I order brownie bites. Completely wrong order..I leave the resturant tell my wife about it she calls, talks to the manager and he comps her meal and the bar tender give her a drink free. So thank you Applebee employees. but get it right the first time and u wouldn't have these issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Marie U.,"Kahului, HI",5,19,642,4.0,10/18/2013,Server Megan made up for a tasty steak over cooked... But I was so happy to order an appetizer and extra side salad... The potatoes on the dish with the steak were awesome.... I was able to eat 1/3 of steak... Which was very flavorful but over cooked... I did enjoy all but my charred meat.... Worth ordering...

April T.,"Appleton, WI",0,15,,3.0,3/18/2015,"PROS: 2 for $20, $1.99 BAHAMA MAMAS or LONG ISLANDS. CONS: Bad management - We ordered HOT bone-in wings. 1 of the wings was noticeably discolored compare to the other wings. We asked the Waiter what flavor that was cause it was not red/orange like the other wings. He said he was unsure. He got his Manager. She wasn't sure either  which made us kind of upset because why would they serve us this and NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS??  But the manager said she'll grab a different wing for us, wished I took down her name, but she was blonde and young and SHE NEVER FIXED THE PROBLEM, she was TOO BUSY talking to people by the BAR. EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. Complained to the waiter he took off the whole order of the wings altogether. thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6

Emmy B.,"Madison, WI",43,128,88,1.0,12/12/2011,"This review is 100% based on the food, not on service.  I ordered a medium well steak and baked potato.  I got a medium rare steak and mashed potatoes.  Before I realized the problem with the steak, I asked for the baked potato and got a pipping hot, hard (uncooked) baked potato.  After I found the problem with the steak, which the waitress admitted she may have entered into the system incorrectly, I said I would pay for the soda and salad I had, but not for the food I asked her to take away.  To my surprise, the waitress returned and said the entire bill was taken care of, my mom's and mine.  Very nice, since the $10 tip I left was what the food we had was worth.  I will not make the mistake of eating there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
Betti M.,"Oak View, CA",0,85,,4.0,10/5/2013,"I have not been to Applebee's in a long time.  We came to this one to eat dinner and watch football.  Our waitress was Spring and she did an amazing job. We asked her soo many questions about the area and general knowledge of Appleton.  She spent plenty of time with us and was so helpful for the rest of our stay.  The food was good, reasonably priced and we were not rushed. Our only suggestion is to have the Trivia game on another night when there is not a football game going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6

Richard S.,"De Soto, WI",1114,588,13,4.0,12/29/2008,"OK, so maybe this is a cheap one, but I wanted to give them credit for very good customer service.  I showed up just as they opened, then  just after I ordered my Cajun-Lime Tilapia, my niece's fiancee showed up and ordered soup and a salad.  Two minutes later my niece came in and just wanted a Lemonade.  Five minutes later my brother showed up and didn't want anything.  I am sure this was all very annoying for my server, but she handled without missing a beat and even reminded us that we were eligible for a 10% discount if we were staying at the La Quinta nextdoor.(We were!)  By the way, my Tilapia was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-appleton-6
