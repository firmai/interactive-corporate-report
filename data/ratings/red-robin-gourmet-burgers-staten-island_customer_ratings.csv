86,Ehsan S.,"Heartland Village, Staten Island, NY",0,8,2.0,1.0,2013-10-29,"I'm going to keep my review simple, broken up into points. - Waiter had major BO. Nearly killed my appetite every time he came by. - Didn't get drinks until we reminded him. - I asked for well done, friend asked for medium. I got medium, he got well done.  - Asked them to bring out our French onion soup first. Brought out burgers instead, and forgot about the French onion soup. Told them to forget the soup at this point. Then waiter made it seem like it was the chefs fault?  - Again, the waiters body odor nearly killed me as time went on.  - Burgers came back, and mine is STILL wrong. Oh, and the fries were cold. Go figure. Manager eventually comped us as they should have. I wouldn't be surprised if they spit in our food at this point for you know... Making them do their jobs right. Basically, stay far away from this place. If I could give it a 0 I would. No wonder why they closed down the first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=80,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000004
89,Kathy P.,"Staten Island, NY",3,52,5.0,1.0,2013-11-09,"The most horrible place to eat on Staten Island. Everything about this place is horrible. First off, we came as a table of 3 and asked for seats at 7pm. They told us an hr and 15 minutes, we come back 10 minutes before that time is up and they told us it's going to be another half an hr. So basically it was an hour 35 minutes. While we were waiting, we overheard the hostess say there were empty tables of 4 but they' weren't seating us because there are parties of 4 that aren't here yet.  So we finally sit down and looked over the rather small and menu and ordered our food and drinks. Our soda was flat and we had to send it back 3 times before deciding there is no good soda here. Then it took 45 minutes to bring us 3 simple burgers. When we got it, the burgers were cold. The bun, the cheese, the fries were cold. The meat was overcooked and the overall burgers were bland even with bacon and sauce. We all saw the bottom of the bottomless fries and was not offered refills despite their ""bottomless steak fries"" advertisement everywhere. The eating utensils were dirty and full of water spots. The plates were oily and sticky. How can a place be this filthy within 2 weeks of restaurant opening? Overall, I will never return here and I do not recommend Red Robin ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=80,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

After waiting for 20 minutes to be seated we finally got to our seats and decided to order some burgers, i got a bacon cheeseburger and fries. as soon as i got my food i knew i was in for something not good. the bacon was not fully cooked, i asked for medium well but instead got medium raw but the outside was crispy almost like it was burnt.

My options were limited, it was either here or the food court. I came in because of the commercial (yum!) we came in early, for lunch maybe 12ish, was seated right away because the place was pretty empty; it started to fill up after we were seated. Right away the waitress came over took our drink orders, and asked if we had any questions about the menu. My husband ordered the burger, I ordered the prime rib sandwich with French onion soup, both were very tasty, and my husband enjoyed his burger. The menu was smaller than I thought it would be, and it's kind of confusing, couldn't get the gist of the appetizer options. I would go again...if and when I'm in the mall, and let's just say I can't stand this mall...plus they had my angry orchard beer, so that was a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=80,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003
111,Pepper J.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,2013-11-13,"This place is beyond bad. And to be soo bad soo soon is a real concern. It usually takes a poorly managed, inherently bad establishment about 6 months to show its true color, but this one seems to have accomplished that in a few weeks.  I tried to eating there twice hoping my first experience was just a bad night, but I was wrong. On my first visit my burger had a foul taste and it was served on a cold damp hard pretzel bun.  When the imported manager seeing my dish picked apart in my attemp to salvage something ask how It was and I said really bad. Her reply, ""Oh well, sorry"". Not sure how folks in Iowa feel, but in NY with a place like this on every corner, that won't fly. On my second visit my wife's sweet potato fries were frozen, the roll on my French dip was hard and stale and my fries were hard and cold. Oh I did get a teaspoon full of cole slaw and all for the shocking price of $14.00. Even if it wasn't old, stale and bad it wouldn't have been worth that. The wait staff is mostly confused but very polite. I assume most are imported as well, but I'm sure the politeness will fad when locals take over and are deluged by complaints on a daily basis. Sorry Applebees for thanking god for another option in the mall, but you should be happy. This place makes you look like a 5 star establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003
106,Frank R.,"Staten Island, NY",7,92,,3.0,2013-11-13,I went here for Veteran's Day and there was already a wait for a table at 1pm. My pal suggested eating at the (small) bar which had a few seats available. As a vet I only qualified for the free Tavern Double Burger with bottomless steak fries while my pal had a Bacon Guacamole  Burger and onion rings. My burger was OK at best and to me pretty much tasted like a McDonald's double cheeseburger. The fries were good. My pal however raved about his B/G burger. I have to compliment our bar person Daphne who was excellent and there is a good selection of draft beers. I got a take-out order of spinach and artichoke dip and for $7 there wasn't much dip there. So overall a positive experience with room for improvement.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000004

I guess I was expecting gourmet burgers because that is Red Robin's motto. How wrong I was. The toppings and bun are awesome but the food is far from gourmet. The burger meat is horrible and tastes like cardboard. You can tell right away that it is not fresh meat. Do not plan on a good quality burger when you go here, plan on fast food.

120,Fran A.,"Staten Island, NY",0,33,1.0,1.0,2013-11-26,"Sorry, Red Robin, but you're just getting worse instead of better.  Our 4th visit was yesterday and it was pretty bad.  Hostesses up front have been clueless on every visit.  3 of them with their heads together trying to figure things out.  You have to stand on top of them to get their attention.  We got seated next to a bussing station where a mob of busboys with lots of time on their hands were very loud and obnoxiously yakking and banging on a garbage can.  We got up and moved to another table and complained to a manager who apologized.  Next, the women's restroom was filthy.  Dirty toilets, empty paper rolls, paper all over the floor, and overflowing gargage can.  Next, our burgers were overdone and not hot by the time they got to our table.  Had to send the food runner back for sauce she forgot to bring.  I should have looked at the check more carefully, too, because we got charged for salad which should have been a free substitution with our burgers.  On 3 out of 4 visits it was obvious that the servers don't know the menu.  When (if ever) is someone going to do some TRAINING in this place?  No one knows what they're doing!!  I was originally hoping to go for the perks of the Red Robin Royalty program but I am losing patience with this place and might just forget about ever going back.  It seems all the employees here are too young, too inexperienced, and too lacking in plain and simple manners to do their jobs well.  Bye-bye, Red Robin!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=120,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002
116,Rose C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,98,1.0,1.0,2013-11-26,"Like so many, I was excited about Red Robin coming to the SI Mall. I usually drive to Jersey when I'm in the mood for quality burgers which in the past they always served. However, this time I was unsatisfied. I expected much more because it's a new place. You just assume they will try harder and be at the top of their game. Not the case, unfortunately. First of all, the service left a lot to be desired. We had to wait almost 35 min. for a table and then were seated at a huge round table for 6 right smack in the center of everything (we were 2 adults and a 5 yr old). Needless to say we weren't happy. When we told the maître'd we wanted to sit elsewhere (there was an empty booth a few feet away, she went to the manager (brown haired girl with a pony tail - this was sunday nite around 7pm) who informed us that we couldn't have the booth because there were people on the way for it. I then remarked that didn't know one could reserve a table at RedRobin - I would have requested a booth when I first walked in. She then said that I couldn't do that. You have to take what's available. Huh? I was puzzled. When I tried to push it she changed her tune and said it had to do with the number of tables assigned to each server. The bottom line is that it was just ridiculous how bad their customer service is. The maitre'd didn't know what to say when pressed and clearly the person to blame was the manager. She was just plain rude. So we wound up sitting at this uncomfortable table and the meal started off badly. The irony is that the booth we wanted sat empty for 25 min. while we ate. It was then given to 3 teenagers who didn't strike me like they had called in advance for it. Advice to Red Robin - I have driven to Jersey with my family numerous times to eat at Red Robin but I will never return to your SI mall location. You don't treat a customer with a family that way. If your staff is amateurish and ill mannered then perhaps you should provide more training because they will ruin your business. That being said, the burgers were dry and lackluster. Also, I ordered a side of coleslaw and the tiny amount they give you should really just be complimentary or give a bit more because a thimbleful is just absurd. There is such a thing as being too greedy, guys. I was so disappointed because this would have been my go to place to eat during my Xmas shopping excursions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003
85,James U.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",1,1,,1.0,2013-11-30,"The short version is very poor service, quality of the burgers is poor and a very long wait. I would never recommend this place or eat her again. Do not waste your time, patience or money here .  The beginning of the incompetent was with the hostess who act as if she had no idea what was going on with the tables and couldn't seat us yet. I had a very long wait, close to one hour for 3 people. Next the general service was poor, our waters took a good amount of time to come out. The burgers we ordered were not cooked the way we asked, we all ordered medium rare but received charred, tasteless and dry burgers. This is when the service got bad on their part. My girlfriend had asked for more water, and the busboy decided to stand next to the manager with another bus boy, conversing in the middle on the restaurant. I'm glad i didn't noticed that the bus boy that was asked to get water for us was the one that was standing there, but i eventually got up and asked for it. The best part was he replied to us"" i was gonna tell your waiter to get it"". I was just stunned by this, because generally that is part of a busies job. I don't expect to be pampered, but it seemed as if the structure of jobs is not held, they have a lot of kids hired that are standing around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=80,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

I ordered a basic barbecue burger medium rare and all I got was a piece of meat that tasted as if it were in a possible kitchen fire. I really felt as though I was eating some type of black drywall. Besides the food, the service was unbelievable. I really still can't believe that it took 2 employees and 1 manager to take my friend's girlfriend's order of a cup of water. Not only did it take the 3 (1+2=3) of them to collaborate to realize what she had ordered, but when one of them had finally brought it, they had quite the attitude.

Word of advice, please hire people that actually need a job rather than those that get hired by chance that don't care. Really, like come one not only have I gotten bad service ONCE but TWICE, while giving it a second Chance.  First time, we take our seats, table is dirty, waitress comes and I can tell already she was not very outgoing and rude. Later on, I ask for water and she kept on walking by forgetting my water while giving the guy across from me a water. So I tell her again and she walked away obnoxiously as if I said something wrong. Not very pleasant! Second time, we take our seats, table is dirty so our waitress switches our seat with a sarcastic tone. Anyway, she seemed very nice, so when we got the check, we were deciding to give her more tip than we usually do (which is 20%). Bill was $35, we put $40, while getting out more singles for tip but she automatically grabbed it without asking us or asking if we needed the change. We were waiting to put a few dollars more when we get the $5 change but nooooo instead we look back and she says ""do you need anything else?"" Answering her own question"", have a good day now"" wow did that set me off. Boyfriend and I had our jaws dropped, in complete shock. We were going to go to the manager but figured that this whole place is crap and if you hired these amateurs than I'm sure the manager must be just like them. That food wasn't worth the service.  P.s. don't forget the hostess. Both times they sucked. They are very slow to adapting to what you are saying. First time, she looked at us like we speaked gibberish. Second time, we walk in, guy that looks like manager greets us but he sees the hostess are not talking to us, busy looking at a paper and talking amongst each other, not acknowledging us at all, he walks away without saying anything to them. Then I ask them about royal club card and then she asks me are you eating here tonight? I'm like yeah and then they ignore us again to talk then finally, ""follow me, no wait, one minute...

I had the whiskey river burger with fries and he had the guacamole bacon burger with fries. Both burgers were good and delicious. Our food came to us at a decent wait time. We ordered pretzel bites and wings as appetizers. The pretzel bites were okay; I wouldn't order it again. The wings were finger licking good especially with the yummy sauce. I did get a bit annoyed at the end though when our server handed us the check when we still had food on the table and we never asked for the check. Overall my experience was good.

58,Vincent D.,"Staten Island, NY",0,3,,1.0,2014-03-08,Decent food but horrible service. Waited an hour and when it was our turn to be seated the person at the front desk had no one to seat us. We had to wait another 5-10 minutes. When we finally got to our seats and ordered our food everything was great until the food came.   There wasn't any silverware on the table or napkins so we had to wait until the wait staff came back. Then someone at our table (of 3) didn't get half their order. We waited another 15 minutes before our waitress came back to tell her. When we told her she says sorry then disappears. We wait another 10-15 minutes our waitress not even in sight so we ask another waiter.  So we have another 10 minute wait. Finally a random waitress tells the manager and he takes care of it. The staff here just seems to not care and just straight up disappear. Also the endless fries? Never even got the chance to ask for more(if I wanted any) since the wait staff just disappears after you get your order. The food wasn't amazing and it's definitely not worth the wait.

40,Nina L.,"New York, NY",497,694,98.0,4.0,2014-03-17,"After countless commercials on local television*, the greater New York area finally has a Red Robin location.  Firstly, really Yelpers of Staten Island? Some of the commentary on this page is not to be believed. I think what is missed here is that Red Robin is in fact a chain restaurant. You aren't stepping into the next big thing when it comes to 'gourmet burgers,' but instead are dealing with a glorified Burger King. When you're shopping in the Staten Island Mall, don't try to find that too shocking.  As for the food, it's okay. It's on the same page as other nearby chain establishments like Applebees, TGIF, and others. You mostly dine places like this to get an affordable meal when you're out and about. I do agree that the wait times are a bit crazy at the moment seeing as they've just opened, but to try something new it was worth the extra 15 minutes or so. I got the Whiskey River BBQ burger and it was fairly tasty. Doused in solid, zesty sauce and topped with crispy fried onions it was disgustingly satisfying. I love the idea of bottomless fries to quell my need for an exuberant amount of carbohydrates in one sitting. For the frequently mentioned service, I didn't find it to be better or worse than any other restaurant in the area. Our waiter was actually quite pleasant and attentive even though the dining room was extremely busy. When we sat down I was feeling a bit woozy from not eating all day and requested my fries arrive as soon as possible. They came piping hot within minutes! We also split a salted caramel shake and instead of bring one large cup and two straws, he nicely had it separated and garnished**, with the salted caramel (which was too salty, sorry RR), and huge dollops of whipped cream.  Overall, I don't see what all the negative fuss is about on this business' Yelp page. I wish them success and if I'm ever desperate in the Staten Island Mall I wouldn't mind stopping in again. *I'm a complete sucker for moving pictures of fake-ly glazed burgers. **Yes I used garnished in a Red Robin review...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=40,1.96,1.96,1.96,2.128,1.96

109,Incognito W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,138,,2.0,2014-05-25,"Possibly the WORST service I've ever encountered. I felt pretty stupid recommending we go here, since we were supposed to go to our usual place Applebee's right across the way. Long story short, our waitress Bianca or Brenda or something with a B, looked about as excited to be there as she was to have a root canal. We were seated in the corner and then literally forgotten about. Not a single person came over to ask us if we needed something, how our food was, nada. I went here once before and have to say I enjoyed the burger, so I ordered it again. Ten years later, we had a different girl deliver our cheeseburgers, which we all ordered and had asked to be cooked differently. So how the hell were we supposed to know which burger was which? The moron's answer ""Oh, I don't know. The guy in the back knows by looking at it."" So, is he going to take a bite out of my burger to see which one is well done and which one was medium rare? Can he see through the burger?Then she disappeared, one burger got sent back and we waited almost half an hour for a new one. I also got to hear the never ending complaining from my family, how this place ""Sucks and the food is terrible."" Those were the words from an 81 year old.

Went back last night with my husband and 2 sons.  Same story as the last time, only worse.  When we walked in no hostess was around, she showed up at least 5 minutes later, said she would be right back, another bit of time, she came back to seat us.  Then just like our last visit 3 months ago, no wait service to be found for 12 minutes (timed it this time). We ordered our food and did get our drinks pretty quickly.  But then you wait and wait, you never see your wait staff again, and you wait some more.  As we were looking around the room, we could see many people complaining to various staff, others walking out after waiting for wait staff, others walking out after waiting for food for an hour (for appetizer).  I would have walked out too but my kids were hungry and it's hard to explain to them that we've been waiting to long.  APPETIZERS finally came after about 45 min, food followed that another half an hour later.  Overall, 2 hour meal, most of that time spent waiting.  We also had no silverware or napkins on our table, I spilled my drink while waiting and had to go through my purse looking for a tissue to wipe up the spill.  Food was ok when it came, a bit cold from sitting around.  It didn't come with the side of bbq sauce that I ordered and the amount of fries in my little cup holder was anemic.  LIke others have said, what good is bottomless fries if you can never find any staff to order them?  I will say that our waitress was pleasant and seemed to be trying to do a good job and I give her credit for a decent attitude when so many people are complaining.  Not sure what the problem is here, but think that there are many, front of the house needs to get in order and obviously there is some type of problem in the kitchen.   If you are looking for this type of food, honestly, go across the aisle to Applebees. I can't believe that this place will stay in business at this locale for long if this keeps up.  I really felt badly for people sitting there for over an hour with no food who had small kids with them........just terrible......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.7960000000000003,2.12

The kitchen staff at this location either need to ALL be fired, or they need an intensive retraining session.  Let's be honest, the cooks and expediting stations are not making complicated meals, they are primarily making burgers and fries.  To say that the wait time for the burgers is unacceptable is an understatement and I can guarantee that if you do not address and bring in some veterans to run the kitchen properly, this business will fail.  I was shocked to hear that this location has already been open for 8 months; the mistakes that were made were rookie mistakes, something simply doesn't add up.

53,Nancy M.,"Staten Island, NY",0,3,,1.0,2014-11-16,"Today was the first time I went to Red Robin and it will be my last. I went there this evening with my boyfriend and a friend of ours, and let me express my great dissatisfaction of my experience there.  First we walked in and the hostess greeted us with an attitude. As a hostess and the first person I see when I walk into an establishment (especially for the first time) I should be greeted with a smile, a ""How are you?"" and asking how many will be in my party. Not me having to initiate the conversation. We were told we had to wait 20-25 minutes, which, at the time, was fine after seeing a few people in the waiting area already when we walked in. 20 minutes go by and we sit down, however, we see not one person actually leave the restautant (and there's only was entrance and exit because this location is set up in a mall and the mall was already closed, our mall closes at 6PM on Sundays.) We finally sat down and I count that there are 14 tables in total and more than half of them could have sat 3 people and no one had left the restaurant!  I would understand if it was a Saturday and dinner time, or even if it was busy tonight, but it wasn't! As I looked around at the empty tables, 3 of them weren't cleaned, including one next to us. Our waitress finally came over and never introduced herself or welcomed us to the restaurant she didn't even seem like she wanted to be there in any way. After waiting for our drinks to come (which took about 15 minutes) the tables still weren't cleaned and there were absolutely no bus boys or anyone else making an attempt to clean them!! Still not knowing our waitresses name, she was subpar and didn't understand my order or the menu item of the combo salad with a soup. I ordered a Caesar salad with a Tortilla Chip Soup and she said ""So you want a Caesar Wrap"" as a statement and not a question. I corrected her and even though she seemed confused as anything she thankfully she got my order right.  Half an hour goes by and we get our food. The 2 burgers that my boyfriend and friend ordered were decent, not the best and the fries weren't even hot. The salad and soup I got was ok. Nothing amazing for $10. The salad was small and the soup was way to cheesey  and the chicken within it tasted fake and rubbery beyond belief. The menu item itself is misleading to say it had vegetables whereas it only has corn.  Now that we're almost done with our food at this point, the food that had been sitting at the table next to us the whole time still hasn't been cleared along with the other tables! Our waitress at no point came over to us and checked how we were and when she did she didn't even ask if we wanted refills on the fries that came with the other 2 orders or our drinks. As she started to take the plates away we had to say that we wanted refills on the fries and she seemed baffled and took the plates away and brought us more fries. Finally when it came time to get the check (we finally learned the name of the waitress off of the receipt) she tosses the check holder onto the table! After the tedious wait of about 25 minutes for her to come back and forth, we're finally able to leave. After this horrible experience, I will NEVER come back to Red Robin. The service, waitresses, and entire  knowledge of the staff needs to be greatly assessed because this was probably one of the worst experiences I EVER had in my life!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=40,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.7960000000000003,2.4

Now that I got a persons attention and gave fair warning I wish I read others comments before going to this red robin in staten island mall. Next time I'll make the LONGER trip to New Jersey or to Long Island. I went cause I figured it would be just as good as other locations. I have no idea who manages this location or owns this franchise but it's bound to fail if they don't fix this issue. Place was barely full and had to wait around for 15 minutes. I walk in to see plenty of open tables. Then they try to seat me near this corner table which was so tight but was allowed to change once they cleaned another table. Yes tight and yes cause perhaps I'm TO FAT and yes I should stop complaining I can't fit in that booth and not go there but already there and I'm a foodie. Well I order my drinks along with some wings which had no sauce on them not to mention that they mention you can get dipping sauces. Waited around hoping for server to come, yes the place was still somewhat not busy. Almost ate my wings, another person brings food and I ask about my dipping sauce & was told they'll ask my server, the server returns & asks what do I want? Really.? I'm wondering if it was written down, I'm asked what do I want so I said I'd need to see menu then states to me that now they recall and will get it. Now for my food complaint, yes the allure is bottomless fries which are great if you can get them here cause by time my server came back I just ate what my girlfriend left. I was fed up waiting for service. I know if it was busy it would be a reason. Got the prime rib dip but sandwich was COLD and so was my girlfriend burger. My sandwich had cheese which cause it got colder the cheese started,to coagulate. Service was slow that my girlfriend got up to go get a bottle of ketchup from another table for use. The hostess seemed overwhelmed or confused of what to do when I was waiting on line with others waiting as well. My server seemed annoyed but to be fair it's January first and maybe tired from partying or I should just not judge cause after all I seldom saw them come to my table!

I had to flag her down after 20 min so we could finally place our order. My son was literally gagging while eating his kids meal burger and said that it didn't taste good. When we finished our meal, we ordered 3 milkshakes to go (one kid size, 2 regular size). The waitress brought us our shakes and the cups were only filled half way. When I asked why the adult shakes were the same size as the kid shake, she said for some reason that's just the way the guy in the back did it. I asked for them to add more and she gave me an attitude. An hour after we left, my son ended up getting sick and after speaking to the other people in our group, everyone who ordered a burger got sick.

69,John J.,"Staten Island, NY",1,92,,5.0,2015-04-03,"Went here again last night, with a friend. Once again, the food was great. They specialize in burgers here, and they really do a great job. The burgers also come with never ending fries, so I got a couple orders of them. The burger was awesome, the fries were good. Service: Our order took about 15 minutes to be brought to us. I did ask for my burger to be well done, and I think 15 minutes is reasonable, I take about 8 minutes to cook a burger at home, and I don't make it well done, so 15 minutes is reasonable. Price: Red Robin, please do something about the price. My burger was 10.29, not the worst, but alittle high, considering I can buy 4 burgers for $7 at supermark to make on my own grill, my friend's burger was 13.99, and he ordered a drink which was 4.49 (a lemonade drink, not an alcoholic drink).. So at the end of the meal, I was satisfied, my burger was really good, and a nice size, I had 2 orders of fries, so maybe that makes up for the higher price. My friend however was extremely pissed off, he wound up putting in $22 for his share of the order and tax/tip. He was pissed and said he doesn't want to come here any more. $22 for a burger and lemonade is ridiculous, without the tip his share still would of cost $19. I don't think anyone should pay $19 for a burger and lemonade. other than the price, this place in my opinion, is the best place to eat in the staten island mall and its area of neighboring restaurants across the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=60,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.324,2.12

The wait staff was nice but when you have one waitress for like 15 tables, you know it isn't going to be great. I'm giving this place 2 stars because the food was decent but that's about it.  We ordered the Guacamole and Salsa with chips for the appetizer. The portion was so small it was ridiculous...the bowl of chips was probably about 8-10 tortilla chips. The guacamole and salsa were good though. Even if you ordered a few different appetizers, the portion would still be too tiny in my opinion.  For the main course, we both had the keep it simple burger which came with toppings on the side and bottomless fries. I only know the fries were bottomless because it said so on the menu but no one ever told us we were entitled to refills.  When our meal was served, I was asked by the runner if I needed anything and I asked for honey mustard sauce which I never received. We just used the salsa and guacamole for the fries. Our waitress did not check on us once to see if we needed anything and my sister didn't have any water or soda to finish her burger. It literally could take one minute to check on someone and she should have came back at least once. No one ever asked us if we wanted more fries or a refill either. We also waited about 10-15 minutes for the check after finishing everything on our table. I doubt this place cares that they have a 2 star rating on Yelp. They are located in the mall which means people will always come here based on convenience.

Geez first of all when we walked in to the establishment the girl at the front podium just continued chatting and laughing with a coworker and didnt even acknowledge us untill i said umm hi can we step inside and sit ourselves or do we have to wait for you ? So then we finnaly sat and waited about 15 mins for anyone to come over and ask us if we wanted anything to drink and or order appetizers ,  but that was ok because our waiter was the kid that just walked in as we were entering too so i understood it wasnt his fault because they should have sent someone else to start us off while he gets ready . So now while we're waiting we noticed they have those new electronic touchscreen thingys on all the tables and that was pretty cool because you can now look at the menu on there and there's games on it for the kids BUT didn't help much with 3 kids trying to play at the same time lol ,It was pretty dead inside and all the tables around us were empty so we asked if we can grab the one on the other table and the waiter apologized and said sorry im not allowed to do that which i didnt understand why if no one is there but no problem i know he doesnt make the rules !! I ordered a burger med rare and onion rings and the kids got chicken fingers and a burger , they split it 50/50 . Now here's where it gets bad , my burger came well well DONE LIKE A DEEP FRIED AND OVER GRILLED HOCKEY PUCK but i didnt say anything and just ate it because i was hungry and i didnt wanna sit too long because if you have kids you know where im coming from lol just wanted to eat quick before the kids started buggin out lol. The onion rings were perfect and the thai dipping sauce was delicious but the fries were blah very boring , just steak fries but thats it . Imo they should season them or something and oh yeah i forgot to mention they have some sort of seasoning on the table but if i have to do it myself then i might as well make my own burger too. Towards the end the waiter came and asked if everything was ok and he noticed half of my burger was just sitting there so i said ""dude look at the burger its very well done "" and he said "" didnt you say med rare "" i said yup and he then said wait let me get you a new one and i said naaa man its all good i was starving so just ate some and thats all ,He then sent over the manager who was also a sweetheart . She said ih sir let us give you something else on us amd i said no its ok but thank  you and she said ok im so sorry about that i will remove it from the check which she did.

15,Anna T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,29,44.0,4.0,2016-08-26,"To all the parents of kids with food allergies, this review is for you.  My son has multiple food allergies, and so dining out isn't usually an option for my family.  A few months ago, on Father's Day Weekend, I really wanted to take my husband out for a meal and include our son.  To my surprise, many mommy websites listed Red Robin as a great restaurant for customers with food allergies.  I looked up their site and was impressed with their interactive allergen menu.  It helped me eliminate the allergens we were avoiding and gave me a sizeable list of options available for him.        This was one of the best allergen menus I've seen.  It was concise and very thorough,  allowing me to decide on his order ahead of time.  Rather than just stick with one or two ""safe options,"" Red Robin offered a variety of options that custom fit his needs.        We arrived at Red Robin right before the busy lunch orders began, so thankfully there wasn't any wait.  When it was time to order, I told the waitress of my son's food allergies, she wrote it all down and said it wouldn't be a problem.  His food arrived a few minutes before everyone else's, our waitress made sure he had the correct order.  Throughout the meal, she kept checking in on us to see if there was anything else we needed.    We ordered the Burnin' Love burger with Fries, Nacho Crunch Tavern Double with salad & balsamic dressing,   from the Kids Menu & Chicken Stickens from the kids menu.  The Burnin' Love burger was juicy and spicy, it was a nice blend of chipotle and pepper jack.  The Nacho Crunch Tavern was yummy! It wasn't as big as I originally thought, but it ended up being very filling.  The pizza was pretty good, my daughter enjoyed it.  My son ordered the chicken stickens & loved it! He loved being part of the group and not being singled out because of his allergies.  For the first time we didn't have to bring a meal from home for my son, he was able to join us and have his own prepared dish.    At the end of the meal, we paid our bill at our table on the Ziosk Tablet.  No more waiting in line or flagging the waitress down for the bill, everything can be done at the table.  Every restaurant should implement the Ziosk table tablets.  Overall, we had a great Father's Day Lunch and are so thankful to the staff of Red Robin for going out of their way to be professional and caring!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.288,2.28

The appetizers arrived quickly:stuffed mushrooms,cheese sticks & onion rings:  Apparently they did not change the frying oil; they All had a horrible aftertaste!  Which even the dipping sauces provided did not improve the taste. I ordered the ""Bleu Ribbon"" burger the only thing I ate was the meat itself; the bread and fillings had a weird taste. Also the steak fries had the same weird aftertaste as the fried appetizers. I just left everything on the plate uneaten... talk about a hot mess of a meal. The price for the meal would've been reasonable ..if the food was good; but it was unpalatable.

My food arrived cold, asked to have it warmed then the burger was tough, order cup of coffee that tasted bad and was also cold. My granddaughter's dish was also cold. And the bill was $32.00. Never again!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island,2.64,2.29,2.29,,2.43
