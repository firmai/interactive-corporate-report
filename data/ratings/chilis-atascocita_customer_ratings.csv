38,Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35.0,3.0,2012-04-18,"Typical Chili's, not bad but definitely nothing to write home about. We dropped in for a quick drink and dinner. Sat at the bar because it's always easier and faster (and in this case it was). However be aware that this Chili's is in Humble and therefore smoking is allowed in the bar. I had forgotten that there are places that still have smoking inside (a little behind the times for what is supposed to be a 'family' restaurant. Oh well. As for the food. I tried something different this time and got the 6 oz sirloin. The beef itself was okay, cooked exactly the way that I asked. The problem was that it arrived with a garlic spread on top. The menu mentioned nothing of garlic, just mentioned a butter spread. I scrapped it off and ate the steak, but I think the garlic was an inappropriate topping. It just tasted weird. The mashed potatoes were very bland as well. From now on I'll stick to the chicken pasta which I usually get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

I felt like I was on an episode of KITCHEN NIGHTMARES and I was waiting for Gordon Ramsey to walk out any minute. She was starving and just opted to get the bun changed out for a fresh one. The buffalo sauce had been cooked into the batter and it looked like a fried Snickers from the carnival. WTF?! I despise stupid cooks who just don't give a damn!  The only reason Chili's get 4 stars is because...well, it's Chili's and every experience hasn't been like this. Also, the server (whom I believe was also a manager or something) was pretty attentive and made it easy to get the order corrected, BUT seemed clueless on the fact that the chicken should been changes out, too.

This would not have been an issue but she was not wearing gloves and was also seen handling dishes and scrapping debris off of them with her nails and picking her pen off of the floor after it dropped. I also saw other employees scrape food off of eating utensils before placing on serving plates. The person putting the orders together burned his hand while opening a bag of food before shaking it into the ""to go"" box. Yes, he cursed and no, he was not wearing gloves after also handling the money from his till. I did not observe any of the servers or expediter wearing a hair net. All of this was observed standing at the ""to go"" counter. Needless to say that this coupled with the stagnant sickening smell of old smoke and beer means that I will not be back.

65,Betsy F.,"Kingwood, TX",64,8,,1.0,2014-06-12,"Went to Chili's last Saturday, June 7th, for a late dinner. The first issue came when my buddy touched something on the tabletop computer/monitor/game thing, at which time it thanked him for his purchase. He had no idea he was buying something as the screen didn't note any sort of price, or even confirm you want to purchase whatever it is..nope, just a big thank you!  We immediately told our server who said the manager would come talk with us. He never did. We decided to share an order of Chicken & Shrimp Fajitas. When then arrived, the chicken looked microwaved & the shrimp were not pink & looked totally undercooked..it IS Chili's Bar & GRILL, right? One would expect the fajitas to look, well, grilled! After sending the order back, we received another order that looked exactly the same as the first. We ate very little of the meal, got the bill & wouldn't you know it, an extra $.99 was charged for the ""purchase"" made by my friend. Makes me wonder how many folks end up with the same charge, due to touching the screen not realizing they're on the hook for $.99 or of course a child does it...many probably never even catch the extra charge on the bill! That's one heck of a racket the have going!  At this point, I had enough of this place, vowing never to return.

15,ChelleBelle V.,"Houston, TX",7,58,151.0,4.0,2014-08-15,The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the bathroom was a mess and although toilet paper was all over the floor the rolls were empty in the stalls. Bathrooms are VERY important to families!!!  The food and service was perfect!! Our drinks were filled promptly and our order was served hot n fresh.  My daughter had the lunch special that included a soup & main dish. She chose the baked potato soup which I tasted and it is so creamy and good!! Then she had the fresh mex salad that she loved. She had it with the chipotle grilled chicken and it was so fresh and full of flavor. I opted foe the side salad and avocado bacon chicken sandwich. It comes on a pretzel bun but I asked for the wheat Texas toast and it was YUMMY! The tx toast actually tasted homemade with a kittle honey wheat flavor. I'm loving their new menu. For a chain restaurant they have a good menu going and we will be back sooner than later.  Our server was great and we arrived just as they opened so there was no wait. Disappointed that they still allow smoking but fortunately no smokers had arrived during our time there. We do avoid going there for dinner just for that reason though.  Thanks for the great meal!

52,Joey H.,"Humble, TX",0,34,,2.0,2015-10-26,"The food is typical for Chili's - okay and the menu is kind of all over the place.  What distinguishes this from other Chili's is the terrible wait service.  I've been there four times and it seems to get worse each time.  Tonight was the last time -  we went in around six with our five year old son, and the place was just over half full.  We were seated quickly and then waited fifteen minutes for our waitress.  The waitress seemed to be deliberately ignoring us and we finally said something to the hostess about how she hadn't even bothered to say ""hi"" or take our drink order after being there 20 minutes.  The hostess assured us the waitress would be over in just a couple of minutes.  8 minutes later, we were still sitting at the table with no drinks and a fussy kid.  A family of nine or more came in and sat down, and the waitress immediately went over and took their orders while looking at us like ""ha, look what I just did"".  Anyway, we immediately left after letting one of the manager's know what happened.  I don't particularly like giving bad reviews, but this Chili's has truly earned it.  Part of me thinks they deserve one star, but their food, while not great, is pretty consistent with other chili's. Don't just take my word on this, read the other reviews...;BAD BAD SERVICE    NOTE - went back seven months later and the service was much better so I bumped it up one star 5-8-17 - Took that star back.  Recently went back to Chili's and they no longer have chicken fried steak or gravy to go with any of their sides.  The last time I went there, some people in the back of the restaurant (employees working in the back), got into an argument and started yelling at each other -  everyone in the restaurant could hear it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.4800000000000002,2.24

Across the restaurant.  My wife is injured with a leg and shoulder and couldn't manage a booth.  A table was necessity not preference.  After that, service was sub-standard as  the waitress (different than the one that seated us) only returned to deliver food and then the check.  Drinks sat empty most of the visit.  Chips were greasy, chewy and not edible.  Manager on staff, Trey, was too busy making jokes with his staff to notice or care and actually seemed to condone their behavior towards ""the customers in the wrong section"".  Would hate to think this is how they might treat someone permanently disabled!  Do not visit this location.  Go to the one on 59!
