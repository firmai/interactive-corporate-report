A M.,"Boston, MA",0,47,,3.0,12/13/2017,"This has been my go-to Fridays for about 10 years and boy oh boy has it changed. When I first starting coming here, it was pretty decent, including employees and service.  However, now it seems like management has been quite careless on the upkeep of this establishment.  Most employees are so unprofessional. ED however, whom is always up front- is always super nice and professional but the staff overall, are much younger in age than their past hires and so they seem to be careless and not very sensitive towards the needs of their customers.  Why 3 stars? Welp, luckily, 8 out of 10 times my ribs are awesome but I do have to agree with my fellow yelpers on this, this establishment needs help, c'mon guys you have the movie theater and Legacy Plaza up the street, something that the Norwood TGI Fridays (which is now closed) did not have! Location draws in more crowds, you must keep up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham
Eric L.,"Canton, MA",66,1,,1.0,11/2/2017,"One of the worst restaurant experience ever. I worked in the restaurant business before and eat out min of 4 nights per week.  Should have picked up the hint when the restaurant was more than 3/4 empty and I had to wait 15 minutes for a table on a Thursday night. They only had 2 servers on duty.  It took a while before she took our order.  My JD chix strips were dry and over cooked. Not fresh. Come on now- that is your signature dish.  Then after about an hour of ordering, my kids Mac & Cheese came with my wife's pasta. My kids are 5 and 3 yr old twins.  Her pasta was not even hot. It was like warm like it's been sitting out for a little bit.   The family finished their meal and my food was not even out yet. I told them to cancel it and my food comes out 20 minutes after everyone else. Reason I wanted to cancel is because it was now ten minutes before eight.  I got there at 6:15pm.  When I voiced my grievance with the supervisor and the waitress,  they could have cared less.  I would be embarrassed to work or manage this place with my experience I received.   Did not even notice the poor ratings till I went to do your review. Fridays is going downhill",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham
Joe V.,"North Reading, MA",22,12,,1.0,10/14/2017,"Do not go there. I went there today and this is the letter I sent them....Dear Sir / Madam. I was at your restaurant as you can see today. The food and the service was terrible. Before I explain I want you to know I am not looking for anything for free. I just want you to know how bad the service is there. We ordered our meals. We got our appertisers with our meal not before it the server said ""We have an issue with the cook"" He gave us the food and left. He came back a few minutes later and we told him me wife's meal was not what she ordered. He said ""That's on me I made the mistake"" One of the ladies asked him for salad dressing he said OK. He left and did not come back. She never got the salad dressing. The fellow with us ordered the sandwich with the ajus sauce for dipping. The dipping sauce was onion soup. When the server did come back he said ""Oh I forgot you salad dressing my fault"" We told him about the dipping sauce and he said that was the cooks fault not his. I mentioned about getting the appertisers the same time as the meal and her said "" We are very busy and if I did not do it that way it would of taken an extra half hour"" The place was almost empty and I told him that. Again he blamed it all on the cook. I would like a phone call please about this issue.  Thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham
Jake C.,"West Roxbury, Boston, MA",0,1,2,1.0,12/21/2017,"Waiter came outside and threw food at the car and even threatened to get a gun and shoot us after not giving a good tip; not exaggerating. The waiters name was Dominique and after speaking with the manager Phil he thought it was a joke. After going back and talking with the manger AGAIN on the phone he said he was gonna look at the car, but 3 police cars later nothing had been resolved.  Hoping that these men get punished for there disrespectfulness. Also when we came back the other waiters were yelling at us saying we broke glasses and flipped tables which is false.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham

Demetrius S.,"Burlington, MA",4,91,41,1.0,8/11/2017,Stopped in for Friday night drinks. Sat at the bar. Maybe 12 people total 3 people tending the bar.  Service was terrible.  Took 5 mins just to give me a menu and xlean off the table.  Ordered the new Mai Tai nothing like the picture (no pineapple or cherry garnish like advertised)  Table sticky disgusting  Food was luke warm. The boneless buffalo wings looked awful. Almost as if they just threw Frank's hot sauce on the.  The bar keeps were just laughing and having a good old time. Forgetting other peoples orders.  I have ALWAYS had a good time at Fridays.

Al E.,"Dorchester, Dorchester, MA",0,2,,1.0,1/14/2018,Took my family to go eat today evening 1-14-2018. Took a hour to get our food. The forks and knifes were dirty and smelled. The only set that clean was our daughters. When we finally got our food it was barely warm. My fries was straight cold. Even though the restaurant was half empty between between 5 and 6. Their credit card machine was broken also so thx god I had cash. The food sucked  balls. I wasn't gonna leave a tip but my wife said it wasn't the waiters fault and it's true but I was still pissed. So I left him the 20% tip. This TGI Fridays sucks monkey balls. It was also half empty so I asked if we could get a closer booth to the t.v so we can watch the Saints and Vikings game since it's NFL PLAYOFFS and the charge person who sat us down said no even though they were half empty. If not for my wife I would have cursed that motherfucker out. I'll never go to that TGI Friday's again. The only decent one is the one in Brigham circle. Fuck this place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham
Jerome A.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",0,3,1,1.0,11/18/2017,"I dont even know when to begin. Lets start with the service, as soon as we walked in it was a complete mess. Floors were dirty, the wait staff was grumpy and rude. Especially for a Saturday i was really shocked. Hardly anyone was there and it was still a disaster. The bathroom was atrocious! I wouldnt let my worst enemy be caught dead in that bathroom. Genuinely disgusting. I dont even like doing reviews but after this expirience i was compelled too. The food was very sub par. My girlfriends chicken was partially undercooked and rubbery and my ""boneless chicken fingers"" was partially freezer burned. I mean really? Wtf?!?!... I will never, ever!

Nicci A.,"Randolph, MA",0,21,28,2.0,11/7/2017,"The Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta at TGIF is delicious. The three times I've had it, it didn't disappoint. I also tasted the fried shrimp and fries from one of my dinner guest. Pass on that. But the chicken tenders were good. The sweet potato fries were good too. I didn't try the ribs, but other dinner guest said they didn't fall off the bone, but were tasty. Now that I got that out the way, DO NOT go to the Dedham MA TGIF. Our party had to ask for a waiter and for someone to take our drink order. That was 1/2 hour after being sat. An hour until our food came. They are slow. AND it's filthy. The floor was sticky. Our table...I had to ask a worker to wipe down from previous guest. I pulled my chair in and something sticky was on my left hand. Finally, there was a dirt stain that got on my skirt that either came from leaning against sink to wash my hands of leaning against table to cut a cake we brought. The darkness isn't for ambience. It's to hide the stains..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham
Deige A.,"Brockton, MA",28,124,380,2.0,1/23/2017,"Recently dined here and I just felt uneasy about my meal after a couple things went happened. To start off, our cups were dirty. The bartender told us she would take care of it, she was really polite. This review isn't about the service because the service itself was good. My concern was over sanitary conditions. I mean it's not like they hand scrub the cups, so even when a new cup was brought to us,  they were dirty as well. The cups get dunked between 3 sink basins to ""ensure"" cleanliness but that was far from the case. Next, I noticed an employee pouring a new batch of ice into the bucket. Okay cool. But then she used her own bare hands to push the ice cubes to make room for more ice. Now I'm not sure where your hands have been, but I sure don't want them on my ice cubes if you're pouring me a cup to drink.  I'm not even going to really touch base on the food since there's not much to comment on skimp-the-sauce wings",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham

Then we ordered and while waiting for our food my mother watch a waitress drop the nozzle (that attaches when you pour the drinks) on the floor bounced a few times she looked around to see if anyone noticed picked it up and used it without cleaning it. Disgusting. Then our food came my mother ordered her burger well done and at best it was medium rare and she didn't want to order anything else since we had waited close to an hour for our food to come.

We walked in and it wasn't crowded with no one at the door we sat ourselves and so did the three patrons behind us. After sitting at the bar, with 5 other people it took the bartender about 10 mins to reach us. After my friend had ordered ( while I was in the bathroom) and wanted a full rack of ribs with his steak and  other half rack was offered as an add on she told my friend he had to order two meals. So we ordered our appetizers and drinks( which looked and tasted like syrup and juice) our appetizer came out. We had no side plates or utensils. And we sat there patiently for 8 minutes while our food had gotten cold. And the same bartender who argued that she worked there 16 years and couldn't get us a full rack of ribs passed us by twice!!! Horrible experience!!! I won't be back we then went to fridays yesterday ( thursday) in Framingham. Ordered the same exact thing. And was happily obliged. Service was great in Framingham!!

Stephen S.,"Stoughton, MA",0,1,,1.0,6/13/2016,"The common problem with ALL TGI Fridays is that they close down around 1130-12 way before their actual closing time. This Friday's is no exception. When I get out of work late, I know the rules, I might not get to a restaurant in time for a last call beer, but this TGI was awful.  The staff on Saturday June 11 was absolutely horrible to my girlfriend and I. The door was locked before we got there at 12:30am but we slipped in after a nice guy let us in. Just looking for a quick bite, a small app, a coke, whatever they had available. But not one of the four workers at the bar would even make eye contact with us, though we sat right by one. He only continued to dry glasses and intentionally look away. No hello, not even a 'sorry we're closing now because we all want to leave early' but a deliberate cold shoulder.

The restaurants biggest downfall is its staff. While all may not be worthy of a two star, they are bogged down by the ones I witnessed. First, the young lady who ran the searing decided to take a bathroom break which lasted 15 mins- and caused a line to pile up at the door. I was forced to walk to the kitchen to ask if anyone was taking seating.... A substitute scrambled to the front, never apologized, and just proceeded to seat people.  Location: you can feel the dirt on the floor and the stickiness of the tables. Food- good.

Anastasia S.,"Dedham, MA",59,33,9,1.0,5/1/2015,"I use to go to TGI Fridays all the time with my father when I was little and I loved it -- when you're a kid you are very low maintenance but I loved the décor and we always seemed to have a good time and a good meal when we would go there. As I grew up and now live near TGI Fridays I have decided to give it a try on a few occasions and I can say it has gone downhill. We got our appetizer the same time as our entrée which makes no sense! Either way one plate of food is going to get cold which it does and you are then left with a cold plate of wasted money! I should've learned my lesson but I went a few days ago with my boyfriend and we decided to share an appetizer and entrée  and of course it was brought out at the same time luke warm. Tasted like the mashed potato's were the instant mashed that you find at the food store. The steak was not made Med-Rare it was over cooked. And the ribs were semi good but we weren't given enough napkins as every place should know that ribs get messy. It also took our waitress about 20 mins to get us water and then another hour or so to refill our water! My drink was just awful it was very sour and disappointing. We decided to get the brownie obsession which we always would get and when it came out and was smaller than the size of my fist it made me very unhappy. Overall it was a very disappointing ""date night"" left me hungry feeling like I wasted money and time. After writing this review I hope you can save yourself and not waste money. Save the money for somewhere better like Halfway Café in Dedham or Hibachi in Norwood.  TGI Fridays doesn't even deserve a star from me -- If I could give them zero stars I would. So if you want low class dining with screaming children and bad service and horrible food by all means please pick TGI Fridays in Dedham.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=40

It had dried up macaroni, sauce, and all kinds of gunk all over it. Mentioned it to the hostess who sat us down, and she was nice enough to clean it for us. But that was nothing compared to the fingernail I found floating in my drink later on. To make matters worse, I was already half way through my drink and the nail looked like it had fungus. Beyond disgusting and disturbing. I don't know how I didn't end up throwing up, but I definitely ended up nauseous and lost my appetite. So disappointing. The waiter went to get the manager who said I didn't have to pay for my food or drink. Wish he would have also been more sincere with his apologies. The star only counts for the waiter who was nice.

Just don't leave for more than 15 minutes or the bartenders will throw away your stuff and give your seats to other people because they assume you walked out on the tab. I offered to leave my card, put it in my tab cup, and came back once to find it on my table for anyone to take. They gave me the wrong sauce for my wings, offered to fix it, and brought back the same wings with the new sauce. They literally made me wait 10 minutes to make me think they made new wings.

Jenn B.,"Medway, MA",1,23,1,1.0,5/9/2016,"Because I can't do zero stars :(  The host used a paper tab to not only take names (always done when there's a wait) and took strangely quite the time to sit a family of four before us and ourselves -- the place was barely 1/8 filled?  The server.. I cannot even. Spent more time on my phone waiting on her to come around than I do in other restaurants, even when they're filled. Finished off a Mudslide and house salad before she came with the entrees; was asked if I wanted another drink, which I asked if I could switch to the Blue Rita Shaker. That moment when your table is pretty much done and the time that the server comes around to see if you need anything else before serving your check (more or less an hour after we got seated).... that's when I got the Rita. There was no 'upbeat' attitude, no upselling, no check-ups from the server. Just came around to serve things. Food was overall good. For some reason, my black bean burger kind of fell apart like a sad Burger King Whopper with the avocado slipping out like a mad fish the entire time and bean beads gathering on the plate like a very loose 'burger'. Fries, regular or sweet potato, are always awesome at any Fridays.

Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565,5.0,4/25/2016,"This is definitely one of the better TGI Fridays locations in the greater Boston area. Even though the one out in Milford is considerably better, basically none of the other TGI Fridays compare to the staff, service, and policies of the Dedham location. This location consistently allows me to use more than 1 coupon, and consistently gets my order correct. I felt the need to update this review, as I visited the Braintree TGI Fridays just a few days ago, where they did not go by my order specifications of one PLAIN cheeseburger, while they put everything on it. Then I had to order one from here (I wouldn't have drove back out there......), and it was correct and much more convenient (I live about 10 minutes away). Anyway, they definitely need a renovation, but I'd rather be able to use more than one coupon, have it conveniently located, with great staff (Manager Vicky and Waitress Brianna are both amazing), and great food (that is made right, unlike the Braintree location).

When we dropped into the restaurant it was empty so we decided to eat at the bar. When we sat down we were greeted by the bartender Sergio who was really polite and took care of us during the time we were there. Throughout the game he checked in on us often and made sure that we had plenty of food and booze. He was also knowledgeable about the games and held a great conversation. Watching the game itself was great because they have a ton of televisions around the bar.  In the end the food was great and the service was even better.

I'm not a casual sitdown chain restaurant regular, but TGIF's commercials sucked me in for a burger. What I saw and experienced is similar to other Yelpers: slow service despite being nearly empty; a few hardcore patrons at the bar knocking back drinks in the middle of the day; a server who didn't know the menu and couldn't tell me how many ounces were in a small beer (and who first amused me, then annoyed the hell out of me, by constantly saying ""hey, hey, hey"" like a female Fat Albert (those under 35, Google it); seriously lacking food.  My Spicy Craft Beer Cheeseburger (~$10.50, as I recall) arrived 25 minutes after ordering - again, the place was dead and it was 2:30 p.m., well after lunch rush (assuming they even get one). It was not worth the wait. The charred patty was far past the medium I asked for and the size of one patty on the $1.39 McDouble, but Mickey D's value menu burger tastes good. I did like the fries, but that's not enough to bring me back. Neither is the $8 appetizer credit I got for completing their online survey.

Leon C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",127,57,71,4.0,7/27/2009,"We came here for a late dinner after being skeptical about the Chinese place up the road, at least a chain looks a lot less sketchy than that place. We were seated pretty quickly, there was a game going on and the bar was rowdy, which was nice to see a lively place. Our waitress was all sorts of awesome even though she forgot a straw or something minor. I ordered some crazy cocktail that I finished in 5 minutes before our food even arrived. Apparently the pork chop I ordered took the longest to make and made my friends starve with me. Which I was okay with. ;) All in the all, no complaints here, the staff were friendly, the food was great - best pork chop from a chain, I think, and the price is your standard chain price - decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=120

Food was fair - their new mexican salad is typical chain food nothing special. Burgers were good. HOWEVER - the state of the bathrooms was appalling. It was worse then almost any side of the road gas station I've been to. I would NEVER have eaten here if I had seen the state of the bathrooms prior.

Mike D.,"Stoughton, MA",1,6,,3.0,1/12/2009,"I tend to have a love-hate relationship with TGI Fridays. But, I was armed with $50 in gift cards from Christmas, so I was ready to give them another try!  First off, the atmosphere leaves me conflicted. I like the pop culture junk all over the walls, and the wacky decor is fine. But, and maybe I'm getting old or something, but do we have to have the music that loud? At lunch? I'd like to enjoy my food with the Killers at a reasonable volume, please.  On to the appetizers! Have to say, I've always liked TGI's apps. We got the potato skins with no bacon (dining with a vegetarian). They were good, tasty even, but for some reason were very salty. Not sure of the reason why, but it threw things off a bit. Luckily, Guy Fereti told me they were half off, so I got more average food for less money!!  Then came redemption. I had the Jack grill combo of steak and shrimp wrapped in bacon. Outstanding. The Jack sauce was sweet and sticky. So so good. The mashed potatoes were a good contrast, and the green beans added some nice crunch and balance.  The service was decent; I did have to ask for a refill once, but no problems with the order or the promptness.  Overall TGI's has always been mediocre for me. However, their Jack Daniels' offerings raise them a bit above the average, and will keep me coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=120
Sarah S.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",54,155,3,3.0,3/16/2008,"Anyone who reads my reviews knows I have a soft spot for corporate restaurants. Why? Because they're predictable. And sometimes I need the comfort of your standard, everyday chicken fingers and french fries washed down with a larger-than-life Bahama Mama. So for what I'm about to say, don't hold it against me.   I hadn't visited this chain in a long while. So when I was in Dedham wasteland on a rainy Friday night I said why the hell not. My Jack Daniels marinated chicken was just what I bargained for--not great, not bad--with mashed potatoes topped with onion rings. For an appetizer we got tostada nachos with enough weird meat, cheese, and jalapeo to set your anus on fire. Sorry, that was a bit much. For a Friday, as the name implies, the place was packed. People were having fun. At TGI Friday's! Looking around I got the sense that TGI Friday's was the epicenter of these folks' livelihood. But who am I to judge?  Sitting there, I felt like I'd entered a time warp, regressing back to the 90's, being in a high schooler in the South, where chain restaurants are a reason to live for most people.

We got a couple of sodas and a pulled pork sandwich for me and a BBQ burger for him. I can't really describe what it was about my sandwich, but it was so blah I barely ate half. Their ""seasoned cajun fries"" that were supposed to come with it were just regular fries with a tiny bit of black pepper. The jack daniels sauce that came with it just wasn't my taste.

It did not appear to be very busy, except at the bar.  We put in an order for 2 beers and 2 cocktails and also chose to order our food at that point, as well.  Another 15-20 mins goes by, and our drinks have still not arrived.  When they did arrive, my peach sangria tasted like sour mix and peach schnapps.  My friend's blackberry mojito was equally terrible. It appeared that they were extremely short staffed, as our server was bussing tables, but there was no apology for the long wait or any update at any point.  The only saving grace was that our food did not take a lifetime to appear.  The burgers were quite good, but service was just not up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=100

Once we were sat it took another 5 minutes for a waitress to even come to our table and ask for drinks. In my restaurant, we are required to greet customers within 30 seconds of them sitting down..so you can see that 5 minutes felt like an eternity. The waitress finally came and took our drinks and took another 5 minutes to get them back to us. She then took my order and did not write anything down; I asked for a burger with NO cheese. Guess what came back? A burger WITH cheese and it was an expo or busser that brought it to me. I kindly told him that I asked for a burger with no cheese, it was not his fault.

Chris M.,"Pawtucket, RI",31,125,,2.0,2/27/2012,"I guess there really isn't a lot to write considering this is a chain restaurant.  However, I will give a brief review with a surprise ending.. I was here this past Saturday night after attempting to hit a couple of places with friends at Legacy place.  Everywhere in Legacy place was a minimum 90 minute wait, place is not that good, so we took off.  We ended up at Friday's in Dedham on Route 1 and went right for the bar area.  It was pretty dead.  It was busy for about 30-40 minutes (this was at 6 PM) and then it died out (which was fine by us). Anyway, once we sat at the bar we waited about 15 minutes to place our drink order.  Bartender made our drinks but didn't ask us if we wanted menus and promptly scattered to the other end of the bar.  This blond bartender was making drinks for the servers and being a total bitch (although later she did improve, we all have off nights I guess)..  Anyway, finally got our menus and ordered got an order of the boneless barbecue bites and they were bland.  I have had them before and they can be quite tasty.  They were almost cold, sauce lacked taste (almost like it was old) and they were just OK (2 out of 5)..  The food?  HORRIBLE..  I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, holy crap did it suck.  First of all, the presentation was abysmal.  The chicken was all the way over to the right side of the plate, I went to move the chicken to the middle of the plate, and there were raviolis sandwiched under the chicken.  The Ravioli's were the saddest looking things I have ever seen, if it was a horse it would be shot and put out of it's misery.  The chicken appeared to just have the bread crumbs dumped on it at the last second as they just fell off when you go to take a bite. Chicken was not cooked evenly, so parts of it were almost raw.  The Raviolis? Well, I contemplated eating my Adidas sneaker before these ravioli's.  They were overcooked badly, stuck together, no taste at all, just gross. Cooks in this place clearly don't care.  My Brother got a burger, WAY overcooked..  I didn't get in to how my friend's things were but they didn't say anything awful so I would have to say they felt their meals were OK (although based on the pathetic experience I had, as well as my Brother's burger, I can not say that with 100% accuracy).. I realize this is a chain place, I know that going in, I don't expect much but did at least expect decent food (even mediocre), it's what I completely expect, they couldn't even accomplish that.   The surprise (drum roll....) I know you are all DYING for it, it is GOOD..  Girlfriend is enjoying her Blue Moon, then (continue drum roll)....  GLASS in her mouth! wohoo!! are you kidding?? Glass must have broken in to the ice bin where the frosty mugs are and no one did anything about it.  NOW to Friday's CREDIT, the blond (who I said was being a bitch) was very attentive, got her a new beer immediately and took the piece of glass to the manager.  The manager instantly came over, apologized, took her drinks (which there had been many) completely off the bill and gave her 5 FREE appetizer cards for any Friday locations.  Manger was VERY polite.  However, they did NOT change the glasses out of the bin where her glass had been pulled from (BIG no no) but it was our last drink and we bolted for the night.   Only go here if you are dying of starvation, would recommend it for drinks with friends (as long as you don't get a hunk of glass in your mouth from your beer mug)..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=100

I love going there with my family because we love the food, the atmosphere, and the games.  When you get the menu the prices are really low so you don't have to pay a lot of money for delicious food. If you think that's good, wait until you hear about the food . At T.G.I.Fridays they have lots different food types of food on the menu . My favorite food on the menu are their hot ribs, juicy burgers and soft fries. They also have lots of drinks too.  There is a variety of sodas, juices, slushies, and frozen drinks. My favorite is the blue raspberry coolatta. Now if you think this is my last reason, it is not. The atmosphere is funky. The decoration is so cool. The art on the walls are so artistic and creative. I like how people can listen to music while eating. You can also watch tv while you wait to place your order. When someone comes in the door the light always flashes. Do you like to be entertained? Well they have fun games to play. They have a pool table, video games, and an hockey air table. My favorite game is the hockey air table because the puck moves on air and when someone scores a goal you get a point. 10 points move you to next round.  T.G.I.Fridays is the best restaurant. You and your family can make it fun. They have affordable food that tastes great. The decorations are cool and they have games for all ages to play.

It took our waiter over 20 minuets to acknowledge. I had to stand up and waive for service. When we finally ordered our appetizers, they came out cold. I had to walk to the kitchen to notify a staff member! I even had to go to the bar to get a refill on my beverage after I grew impatient of waiting. The place is definitely understaffed. I will not come back a second time. I would recommend going to Uno's down the street. I got the grilled chicken, it was okay considering had the lowest calorie count (420 cals). The steamed vegetables that come with the meal have no seasoning or anything. My plate was not even warm! The sizzling chicken shrimp was anything but sizzling. The chicken is bland and dry. The bbq chicken salad was iffy. When compared to the same salad you get at Cheesecake Factory, it's a joke. I made it a point to try it and looks more appealing than it tastes. Don't waste your calories on it. There is a first time for everything! I would not consider trying this location out. The fries that came with the chicken tenderers tasted salted cardboard. I am utterly dissatisfied with my meal, waitress, and the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Carissa R.,"Boston, MA",24,9,,1.0,10/28/2017,"This was the second and last time that we will eat here. If I were to say that the host and waitress were unfriendly, that would be an understatement. They hardly made eye contact with us and could have cared less about giving us good service. My husband and I went for the endless apps, and we waited probably at minimum 10 minutes per app to come out. After the second set of apps came out, our waitress started walking away without even asking if we wanted to order more (they are endless, remember). Each time after that we had to flag her down. She not once asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. It took us about 2 hours to eat 5 sets of apps because the wait time was so long between both service and food and FYI, it was not busy in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Dia J.,"Natick, MA",5,35,9,1.0,4/7/2017,"This place is nasty, please save your money. I got my drink in a dirty glass. Wait stuff are rude and don't want to be there, management isn't any better. The bathroom floor is sticky, nasty and stinky. And the wait is ridiculous, I called to get a table I was told 15 minutes I told them I will be there in 20 minutes okay got there and still had to wait. Got our table 30 minutes later they brought our drinks in a dirty class food plate look like the put it in a someone's else's left over plate. I ordered traditional buffalo wings why did my plate had boneless wings in the bottom with BBQ sauce on my plate instead of buffalo. I ask for my pretzel unsalted salt all over the plates. Glass being thrown at wait stuff so lots of broken glasses. This place is trash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Lourdes R.,"Boston, MA",28,2,,1.0,5/5/2017,"I'm going to start with giving this restaurant 0 stars.  Arrived to music so loud I couldn't keep a simple conversation with my dinner date  We couldn't hear each other!  Than after a almost 20min wait our server came and as I began my order she got bothered about my order saying they no longer carry what I ordered, so she removed the old menu (which in fact was badly soiled) and proceeded to walk away.  The food was badly cooked,  parts over cooked other part under cooked. Loose loose situation.   Complained to Manger, she was very apologetic,  removed the meal from bill. Moral of this experience it being the second time for us,   NEVER GOING BACK !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Angela R.,"Romeoville, IL",215,6,1,1.0,6/10/2017,"I love TGI but the service at this location sucks. Sat at the bar for 10 minutes and the bartender served people who sat after us. Didn't acknowledge us until I said ""Excuse me, do you service this side of the bar?""  He finally grabbed us menus. After that, he left and was nowhere to be found to take our orders.

Jay J.,"San Diego, CA",68,3,4,1.0,3/18/2017,"Reserved 7:15 pm on open table. Showed up on time, but didn't get seated until 7:30 pm after they said it was only going to be a 1 minute wait. Sat at the booth with my family and no waiter for 15 minutes. Not even to get out beverages or even greet us. We decided to walk out. It was just so unorganized from the time I stepped into the restaurant until the time I got up and left. We had another event to attend after dinner but obviously we had no dinner and of course we made it to our next event. It was sloppy work. Even the guy who walked us to our booth didn't seem like he knew what was going on. He walked us all over the restaurant to seat us. Definitely under staff and even the staff that were on the clock were very unprofessional. First and last time back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Sheila K.,"West Roxbury, Boston, MA",0,8,,1.0,6/6/2017,"Took my grandson here for dinner after a long absence. Used to love this place, but WOW has a lot changed! At 5:30 there were very few customers, yet the service was slooow. The wait staff was indifferent at best, and acted as though they wanted to be anyplace but there. Grandson's fries and my soup (french onion, and I had to cut the cheese--or maybe the bread, I couldn't tell what it was--with a knife, and it was still rock-hard) were cold.  I had to go hunting for a ketchup bottle with anything in it (most I checked were all but empty) after waiting almost ten minutes for a replacement. Waitress NEVER came to see if we needed anything, I had to go hang around the kitchen until I saw her. Finally while waiting for grandson's dessert I told her to forget it and bring the check. YIKES. I will NEVER go there again. Too bad, used to be a good reliable spot for a decent meal. And oh yes, the bathroom was FILTHY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Todd M.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",14,3,,2.0,3/5/2017,"First I would like to say I work in the industry so it's hard for me to be overly critical of a restaurant because I know that some factors are out of the control of the staff but I just didn't have positive experience here. I ordered the brunch steak& eggs, and waited 18 minutes on a slow Sunday. My eggs were missing so that added another 12 minutes and my steak was over cooked. The manager to his credit remade my whole plate, but forgot my toast. I was starving so I just ate. I will give them two stars because the were polite, but other than that I learned my lesson.... never order anything that requires a temperature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Dee K.,"Burlington, MA",0,5,,1.0,9/21/2017,"Absolutely gross!  I should have known better. Parking lot empty at 12:30 on a Beautiful Thursday.  Upon entering, the floor was sticky.  We were seated at a booth near the bar.  SCREAMING toddler in the booth next to us. She was running up and down towards the bathrooms!  DANGEROUS!  Top that off with loud bar blender nearby!  Chicken in chicken Caesar salad was tough and chewy and who puts the root end piece of romaine in the salad? Sweet potato fries tasteless.  Over priced unimpressive passion fruit(?) iced tea. Don't think I'll ever go to a TGIFridays again!  Just a bad experience.  Go to Joe's American Bar across the street instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20

Marthe G.,"Boston, MA",2,15,32,4.0,9/16/2016,Took my 5 year old daughter out after her starting kindergarten this week. She wanted pasta and although the Friday's isn't where I would normally go for pasta I hadn't been in a while. Our server Xavier was amazing and the food came so fast I forgot how long we were sitting there. My daughter had the half size entree of the Bruschetta pasta and I had the Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad which were amazing. Love this place and tonight was no disappointment especially with the efficiency of our server Xavier.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
Michelle M.,"Norwood, MA",69,3,,1.0,11/19/2017,A friend and i went to this location last night to sit at the bar and have a few apps and drinks. We were greated promptly .. Which was great! But thats all we got. we sat with empty glasses in front of us every single time. We had to flag down the bartender and ask for drinks every time. The bar was dead! There was maybe 4 other parties.. This was the worst experience ive ever had at a bar. We were so annoyed we left and went elsewhere. The male bartender was way more interested on doing flair And sidework rather than asking of we wanted another drink. The female bartender was miserable. Not a smile or interaction in anyway. During our visit a patron ( whom im asuming was an employee) got up from her table and went behind the bar and started making her own drink.. Which she shared w the female bartender. We sat there and watched this woman make herself a drink while we had empty drinks. Awful experience and will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20

The only time you'll see your waiter is when you're ordering your food and when you get your food. Go to unos down the street instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dedham?start=20
