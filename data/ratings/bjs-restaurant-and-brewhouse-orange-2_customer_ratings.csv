430,Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1071,875,388.0,3.0,2013-08-03,"Brand new location right across from the OC Animal Care shelter. Looks like your typical BJs. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who asked us if we were Premier Rewards members and I said no. I asked her what that was but she totally ignored my question. I say ignored because I was standing right in front of her when I asked.  Then we were led to a two-person booth, but it was one of those that was right in front of the kitchen and one seat was just a chair. Why would you take us there when we just passed about 4 perfectly nice, regular booths and the restaurant is practically empty? Our server was nice and told us about the program, our pizza came out kind of just warm. It was not hot. Our BBQ chicken salad was still overdressed even after we asked for lighter dressing. It maybe it was. Staff was nice and kept checking up to clear plates and refill drinks.  The location at the Block near the freeway is definitely convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=400,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

I don't think I can say one thing bad about it :) there was a little bit of a wait but everyone was served a delicious pizza and waiters going around asking if we want drinks (free refills)! The menu was huge with so many options for every taste bud!! Service was fast and the staff was incredible but not pushy like annoying! You felt like they were there to serve you and not to mention there were some super cute waiters!! I had the fettuccini Alfredo which was the best I'd ever had!

750,phil p.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,20,20.0,1.0,2013-08-05,"1st I love other locations I have 2 near my home. The one in orange happens to be near my work. I arrived 30 min early and requested a table for 15 (we were there for happy hour). The staff and the manager told us that happy hour only applies to the small bar area ( the bar is long but the bar seating area is not so spacious). Then the manager told me that there is a 2 hour time limit for our table (really? a time limit? wth!)at the 1:45 mark the manager tells us that the happy hour applies to our table also unfortunately that was 15 min before it was over and our party was walking back and forth from the bar.  at 2 hours we're still ordering food and drink and he said our 2 hours was up and there was a party of 20 waiting (oh they take reservations? they don't) the party of 20 was sat next to us and we remained. i eventually left and some of our party remained the food was good, our server was awesome! the manager had the worst customer service i have seen in a long time!! i will not be back to this location. they are not large party friendly. all members of the party work within walking distance of this place and all were upset at the managers lack of customer service.

643,Mike A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,5,,1.0,2013-08-05,"I've been to several other BJ's in the area, but this one is certainly the worst experience I've had. Mainly, it's because of the manager they had on Friday night. I don't know if he was inexperienced or just plain incompetent. Long story short, we were told that there was a 2-hour maximum on tables, even though they don't take reservations to begin with. The waitresses and bartenders were great but the manager was mostly rude. He  stopped by our table twice for something that I've never experienced. He said he was unable to serve us more drinks unless we identified our designated driver. We identified her and then he said ""OK"" and let us start ordering again. (one shot later) He then stopped by the 2nd time and said that he was unable to serve any more drinks for the remainder of the evening. He did not give any reasoning as to how he arrived at this decision. Mind you, we weren't loud or obnoxious. It was pretty disappointing since we were looking forward to having a spot to hang out after a long week of work on Friday nights. Hopefully this clown gets replaced soon... Bottom line, go to the HB one. Beach & Edinger or Main St.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=700,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404
716,Megan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,36,9.0,2.0,2013-08-14,"I can cut them some slack because they just opened, but their service is still quite poor. They often sit parties by calling out the number of people instead of the name and this can be quite confusing during the lunch rush. And when we were finally seated, we weren't quite sure who our server was as three different people greeted us. The real problem occurred when our vegan friend ordered a veggie pizza with extra sauce to compensate for the lack of cheese. What he got was a pizza with absolutely no sauce. He then asked for sauce on the side and they brought him spaghetti sauce after asking for it twice. The server apologized at the end but didn't seem too concerned. I really like BJ's as a whole and I hope they get their act together soon so that I can go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=760,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536
821,Rosie G.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,1.0,2013-08-16,"I personally haven't been to a BJ's in years... This place/location actually reminded me why. It's Friday, in the middle of the day and its just me and my boyfriend.  We were seated quickly but didn't see our actual waiter until  like 10-15 later. She took our drink order and didn't receive them until like 15 minutes later. Frustrating because she didn't even bring us water and it was pretty warm outside. She walked out to the patio several times approaching other tables and completely not even looking the other way to see if we needed anything. I had to ask another waiter for service. She looked miserable as if she was having a bad day. Personally some people should really not be waiters if they are incompetent  of smiling and having communication skills. I didn't get the waitress name but only because she didn't give it to me when she approached us lol screw this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=840,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404

Came here for lunch with some co-workers at first everything seemed one, until we found ourselves waiting, waiting, waiting and waaaaiting for our food to come out. The waiter was no where to be seen and when he finally approached our table he said that everything was ready with the exception of the mahi mahi tacos, he said that was holding up the order...really!!? fish takes 45 minutes to cook? and it's just two tacos!? since that was actually my order, I tried to keep calm and nicely told the waiter to go ahead and bring out the rest of food so that my co-workers could start eating, he said ""Sure, It will be right out in two minutes!"" then suddenly again we were waiting, waiting and waiting....after 20 minutes (by the way our lunch hour was already up), he brings out the food and turns out my tacos were made but there was a flatbread that was forgotten for another co-worker!!! The manager came and apologized and what not and the flatbread was not charged but the service was just beyond ridiculous! by the time we got our food it was cold and we had to eat in a rush. I understand that the restaurant is new and I am sure things are getting settled but don't lie about what's holding up the food and at least bring out chips and salsa while you have your guests waiting for an hour to get their food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=800,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
603,Art S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",108,73,10.0,1.0,2013-08-18,"For a restaurant that just opened in a new location it does not help itself by hiring bartenders that take forever in serving you a beer. Ten minutes for me to sit in the bar area and still not have my beer that I asked for is unacceptable.  Not sure if our bartender lacked the communication skills to serve us or hated his job all I can say is that we did not expect the type of service that I received on Thursday night.  For a BJs restaurant, I always enjoyed their freshly brewed beers and their delicious plates at other locations including the customer service.  I know this restaurant is in a new area and all, maybe they don't need to worry about the demand but once people start noticing that the service blows here, customers are going to take their cash elsewhere.  Anyways, I will not be returning to this BJs and if I do, I will demand that I get a different bartender, that's for sure.

771,Ryan S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,5.0,2013-08-20,It's a big weekend. My girlfriend is in town from Detroit and I want to gather all of my friends together to introduce her to. What do I pick? BJs!  We had a 12 party group with no reservations and we were seated in 20-25 minutes. That's extremely reasonable. Gave us a lot of time to catch up. The manager Kevin came out and introduced himself to us and told us the seating arrangements he could make for us. He even put out a few pizzas for us to munch on in the mean time. I've never had that happen before.  The food was great and the service was good. Our servers had great senses of humor and delivered the food promptly. They even suggested some seasonal IPAs that me and my friends really enjoyed.  Kevin came back and checked up on us. My girlfriend was in love with BJs. They don't have one in the city she lives in but she's definitely excited to have another Pazookie when she moves out here with me next year.  I'm looking forward to coming here again with her next month when she visits. Thanks guys!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=800,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868

710,Nhi Thao M.,"Santa Ana, CA",110,243,1810.0,3.0,2013-08-31,"My co-workers took me out for a birthday luncheon a couple of weeks ago at this new BJ's restaurant.  We had a reservation for sixteen people.  When we arrived, we ended up being seated at two separate tables of eight that were parallel to each other instead of one long table of sixteen.  My co-worker who made the reservation was a bit disappointed and told the hostess that she was told that we would have one table, not two.  The hostess went to ask the manager, and the manager came out and said that it was easier to seat our group at two different tables because it would be easier to have two separate waiters to each take care of one smaller table than to do one big table, which would take longer to serve.  I didn't really understand that explanation and neither did some of my co-workers (honestly, it just seemed like bad customer service), but we ended up sitting at two separate tables because we didn't want to make a big deal of it.  The waiter who served the table that I ended up eating at was pretty friendly and funny.  I ordered the Black and Bleu flatbread pizza sans the cheese (so it had marinated skirt steak, caramelized onions, flame grilled Portobello mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers and fresh thyme).  It was a good portion for lunch for one person - I originally was going to get the half-pizza with salad, but my other co-worker said that a half-pizza might not be enough, and I ended up being glad I ordered the full pizza because I finished the entire thing and didn't feel overly stuffed at all.  The pizza itself didn't taste bad, but the steak was a bit tough and chewy.  A few of my co-workers shared a large deep-dish pizza and they seemed to like it.  The food took a while in coming out, though, and our waiter actually came and apologized for the delay.  Our waiter also sung happy birthday to me and brought out a mini pizookie (cookie topped with ice cream), which was nice. Overall, I had a good lunch except for the table issue and the long wait for the food, which could have been handled better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=760,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

I knew it was a new location as I work across the street. We went to the movies and got out around 11.00 and we knew Bjs was open till late so we decided to head over to get the gourmet veggie deep dish pizza. My bf was craving it all day so I wanted him to get it before we headed home. We got seated in a timely manner. Our waiter was very friendly as well. He just wasnt too aware of the vegetarian options they had. I ended up ordering a pasta and my bf got the pizza.  Our food took about 40 mins and when they brought it out I saw a piece of chicken in my plate when I actually ordered a veggie pasta. On top of that they forgot to add artichokes and basil to my bfs pizza. So they took it back and the manager came to us apologizing, almost every 5mins we had someone come up to our table and apologize for the mistake. It kind of got annoying  because everyone around us kept watching.  Finally after another 30min wait, they brought the right order and as the guy was serving us he drops the first slice of pizza on the table AHHHH!!! how bad can this experience get. We just stayed quiet and tried to enjoy our dinner. Our waiter then comes to inform us that the dinner was on the house and that they were sorry for all that happened. We just paid for the 2 drinks we ordered and left.  I remember checking the time we left and it was 1:30am.

Service is very polite and friendly. The food  however takes quite a while to bring simply because the restaurant is so big and busy.

480,Mark A.,"Diamond Bar, CA",70,157,1.0,1.0,2013-09-21,"I came here on a Saturday night with a fairly large party (12 people) to celebrate my friend's birthday.  We had reservations for 5pm, and we got seated by about 5:20.   It took about 20 minutes or so for the entire party to show up, but after that, there weren't any delays or anything.  We ordered our food promptly, and the only time wasted was us waiting for our food. Our waitresses were friendly but never came around with any refills of any sort.  The food was typical BJ's - good, but nothing much more than that. But the biggest insult came when we were paying for our meal.  After we got the check, we took about 15-20 minutes for everyone to figure out what they had to pay, but with our group (a bunch of math teachers/techy types) it didn't take too long to get everything squared away.  As we were waiting for the waitresses to charge our credit cards and square out our bill, the manager of the BJ's came to our table and told the birthday girl herself that there was a 2-hour limit, and basically told us to get out. Hey asshole, why don't you at least wait until we get our credit cards back before you start kicking us out of the joint?  I looked at my cell phone and it was 7:35, so almost exactly 2 hours since we sat down.  You really couldn't wait another 15 minutes or so for us to get our cards back so we could leave on our own?

And I love the policies of how to expedite amazing customer service to the paying guest at the restaurants. But let me say this place is a disgrace to the bjs  corporation. The servers are absolutely rude, and do not know how treat their own customers who are tipping them. Not just that, the manager was rude as well. My friend from out of state, she had ordered a drink. Mind you she is 23 years old. The server took the ID and the manager came over Did not say hello and say what was the problem, and began to interrogate her. Then Gave it back and left. The food and drinks too forever and was tasteless. Though the hostess and host were sweet. There were so many things done wrong that I would write an essay to explain everything.

I wanted dessert but I guess I wasn't getting any. So my friends an I are talking and hadn't looked at the check yet.. 10 min later and the waiter comes over can I take that? We reply not yet!

So unorganized, Just yesterday I decided was our last time going there, I went with a party of 9 (3 of which were children) and after waiting 1 and a half hours and arguing with KEVIN the worst floor manager ever, we left. When we arrived, the hostess said it'd be 45 minutes for a booth (which was fine with us) when we went in to check she said we were next up as soon as a booth was available, WRONG! after three booths were given to other parties OF THREE! I asked the hostess why we didnt get the booth and she said ""because your party is too big for a booth!!!!) What the F...?! THEN WHY WERE WE WAITING FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF!!? thats when my head almost exploded and I spoke with Kevin (floor manager) who told me IT WASNT HIS PROBLEM!! After I explained why I was upset, he say's ""I'm sorry it's game night and we will get you seated as soon as possible, it's not my problem"" like he didn't even hear what I had just finished telling him.

834,Ashlee And Nicholas F.,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",30,144,31.0,1.0,2013-10-01,"Reviewed by Nick- I don't often find the need to vent on Yelp, in fact, I often choose to let myself cool off before writing any negative reviews. That being said, I'm writing this a week after my visit on Wed (9/25/13) at about 5:30pm. The place was pretty full, but by no means packed, nor were the servers swamped.  We were sat at our table and it took a good 10 mins for our server (Lorenzo C #363) to even stop by our table to introduce himself. Yeah... I'm calling out names! We asked for some water to start with (and a beer for me), and asked for a Gluten free menu for my wife. Another 10min later, Lorenzo drops of the menu and disappears for another 10min. He finally comes back with the water, only to quickly leave again...  the beer follows shortly. This is about 30min after being seated and we only have water. Keep in mind we are sitting there, menus closed waiting to order, and Lorenzo is nowhere to be found. At this point, I'm really getting pissed about the lack of service, so start keeping my eye on our waiter as he travels about the restaurant, talking with fellow servers and having a blast! At one point, we make eye contact and he's walking straight towards me. I'm thinking, ""Wow... we might actually get to order!"" But no, he literally takes a 90 degree turn and goes out to the patio. It was almost comical... I got his attention after he returned from the patio (and ordered) and was watching him the entire time we were waiting for our food. It seems like the staff here is straight from the movie ""Waiting."" Young people, ungrateful for a job, talking, gossiping, and fraternizing with the other servers rather than tending to customers. When the food arrived, it was dropped off by another member of the staff and we were offered no condiments or even brought out any place settings. When Lorenzo came by again, I had to actually lean back into the isle and block him to get some ketchup. I was never offered a refill on my water or even asked if I wanted another beer (rare). To add insult to injury, my wife ordered a wedge salad with Italian and Lorenzo brought us one with blue cheese (looks the same I know). We were eating out with our 15-month daughter, so we had a narrow window to eat before bedtime. Needless to say, by this time she was getting cranky, and rather than wait for Lorenzo to bring another salad, my wife ate what was brought to her. Next time Lorenzo came by, I brought up the fact that the salad was wrong, and it seemed like he could care less. Didn't offer to take a side salad off the bill ($2.99) or comp a beer... nothing. I had to ask for more water when I requested the bill, paid promptly and left this pit of misery.  My bill said 7:22pm on it, so we were there for almost 2 entire hours.  Food gets a 3- Average chain brew house food, but the service gets a 1. Terrible waiters more concerned with catching up with friends, than serving guests. It wasn't just Lorenzo, I noticed all the waiters back by the patio exit grouping up, talking together and generally ignoring guests on several occasions.  I REALLY hope the management re-evaluates the waiters they hired at this place. I know several, personable people that would LOVE a job at BJ's were they can earn good tips. Sadly, the crew here seems like they have better things to do than serve paying customers. The management should take this behavior as a sign as just that... these people DO NOT CARE about serving customers, so please do them a favor and fire them!  I was actually going to wait to speak with a manager before we left as the level of service left me speechless, but again, we had a cranky baby and had to leave quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=680,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.5320000000000005,2.8

580,Anthony C.,"Orange, CA",113,9,9.0,3.0,2013-11-09,"Stopped in for a bite last night, here is my review: it was about 6pm and it was packed. Had to wait about 20-25 minutes to be seated so we thought we'd grab a drink at the bar while we wait. The bar was packed, took about 10 minutes before there was any sort of opening, even then it was just a small split between some people sitting at the bar. I had wave down a bartender and then shout my beer from 2 people back. She asked me to come around to the side so she could hear.  They have these cool electronic boards next to the bar that rotate between the happy hour menu/times, special deals, seasonal beers, and their own bottled beer so you can take home your favorites! I asked for their seasonal Nit Wit that I saw on the board. She said they didn't have it because it was a seasonal. I guess I should've known better that their witbier was not a fall seasonal. She proceeded to inform me that the seasonal was a pumpkin ale or an oktoberfest. Neither of these were on the board at all. I had the Pumpkin ale and was satisfied. We were seated, and I was alarmed to see that their Filet Mignon (which is why I came here) was not on the menu. I asked the server and he confirmed that the Filet was being removed from the menu. He did offer to check if they still had some because it was a recent change. We ordered the Jeremiah Red and Santa Fe Rolls. He came back with the appetizers and beers as well as bad news: they were done with the Filets. We ordered the Ribeye with red wine mushroom sauce and a peanut butter pazookie. The service was great! He was attentive, went out of his way to help us and made great suggestions for beer and food pairings. Overall:  Service at the bar could've been better (possibly due to the volume of customers) Service in the dining room was fantastic! Beer was great as usual Bad news: Filet is gone :( Good News: Thursdays have affordable brews in addition to the Happy Hour Now you can get Jeremiah in a bottle! -Chewie",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=560,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.668,2.76

Piranha pale ale - pretty good. Nice flavor. However, one of my biggest pet peeves is when someone brings out a kids meal and says, ""careful, the plate is hot"" - really? Then why would you give that to a kid? Just plain stupid. So I asked for a cool plate to put the dinner on so my child could eat her meal without fear. Then, we both enjoyed the rest if the meal - and an absolutely amazing Bizookie! Other than the bonehead who served a child a hot plate (mine was cool, figures), the meal was great!

I can't deal with that when i have an impatient toddler. We were told our steaks took so long because they didn't have it or forgot to put it on the grill. Waitress never came back to check on us so we couldn't ask for water or a least have out son's meal brought out first. When our steaks finally came out it was dry and tasteless.

Walking in, the place is very clean, the staff are nice and greet you right away. We decided to take my brother-in-law out to dinner for his bday on Sunday the 1st. Parking was crazy but walking in, it wasn't that busy. My fiance and I ordered the 2 for $35. He got the pork chops and tortilla soup while I ordered the salmon and house salad. I have to say, we were both very pleased. He has a big appetite so we tend to stay away from the 2 for $ deals because he never gets enough to eat. These were full portions. The salmon was amazing, I typically don't like ordering fish out because most places over cook it and dry it out. Not BJs, it was perfect. Exactly how I would have cooked it at home. Moist, nicely seasoned and everything. My fiance had no complaints about the pork chops. My Brother-in-law and mother-in-law both ordered a burger with blue cheese (yuck) they were both very happy with no complaints. All-in-all, I'm very happy with this location and think they've finally brought something new to the Block, it was much needed. There is only so many times you can go to D&B and Fridays before you're tired of both.

Its a new location so the kitchen is still trying to work out the kinks and communicate with the wait staff. Nothing to deduct stars over though. They see the mistakes, they acknowledge them, and they're fixed immediately.  Perfect customer service. I'll pick this location over the others. 2nd visit: Dec. 21 for our 8th anniversary.   We decided to sit out on the patio. Oh man, if this was our first visit, it would have for sure been our last. Eulises was our server. We both ordered tea. I ordered the fruit flavored tea and me fiance got black unsweetened. The entire meal my fiance was lucky to get 1 refill. Not to mention, we had to basically bombard them to get them to stop so we could get a refill.

We usually sit at the bar and have no problem with service we receive from the bartenders. The day after Christmas my boyfriend and I decided to meet my family here for lunch. I gave the hostess my name and told her I needed a table for 5. She said it will be about 20 minutes. She didn't give me a pager or tell me that she will be calling my name. Before I could tell her that we will be waiting at the bar, she already acknowledged the people waiting behind me so I justed moved to the side. I figured my boyfriend and I could wait at the corner of the bar next right next to the entrance so we could see and hear them call my name while we wait for the rest of my party to get there. As we sip on our beer at the bar about 10 minutes in, I see the hostess taking people to their tables and these people came in way after us, then 5 more minutes pass by and they are seating people as they walk in.  Then my family arrives and I see a hostess with a few menus walking around asking 2 different parties their names. I assume she is looking for me. So I approach her and ask her if she is looking for Stephanie. She replies ""Uh...no"" as she passes right by me. I thought her response was a bit rude. So I approach the hostess who initially took my name and asked how much longer it would take to seat my party. She then looks one of the hostess and says ""Oh here's Stephanie!"" I looked at both hostess and told them that I have been waiting at the bar and no one has called my name. One of the hostess replied ""We called your name twice"" and I told her that she didn't because I have been staring at them the whole time from the bar which was only a few feet away, and I didn't see one hostess go outside or walk around the front calling my name, but only one time and the hostess who was doing that wasn't even looking for me.  I give this BJ's 1 star because something so simple in reference to find where the party is located after putting their name in and even telling the party to wait close by the hostess booth because they will be calling my name shortly would have been nice. Oh, and the rude hostess who brushed me off needs to learn customer service and instead of replying to me with a ""Uh...no"" she could've said ""I'm sorry I'm looking for another party but what is your name and I can let you know how much longer your wait will be.  I don't recommend this BJ's for dining in and dealing with the lazy and unprofessional hostesses.

I go here often with my colleagues after work and it is such a welcoming environment all thanks to the very attentive and friendly manager, Kevin. He is a true professional and he makes sure that our orders comes out perfectly. We usually order a bunch of appetizers to share: boneless wings, ahi poke, avocado egg rolls, spinach stuffed mushrooms. Well, our server accidentally brought out the traditional wings instead and Kevin immediately came to the rescue and like a true professional fixed our order while managing to convince us that the traditional wings were better. He was right after eliciting a few laughs from us and we ended up ordering another round of appetizers based on Kevin's enthusiastic recommendations. (He was too convincing and likable not to disagree!)  BOTTOM LINE: if you want to relax after work with good food, good company and a very welcoming atmosphere, come to BJ's and make sure that Kevin is there...

Not only did he single handedly solve every issue in the restaurant, world hunger, and cure cancer while delivering my wife's first child; but he then turned around and disarmed a 10 megaton thermonuclear device set to go off during this year's Superbowl using only a herring, some duct tape, and half of a plate of leftover spaghetti. As if that weren't enough, he then kicked a record distance field-goal that won the Superbowl for both the Broncos AND the Seahawks AT THE SAME TIME! This elicited cheers from the exhuberant crowd at the restaurant, and I pee'd my pants with excitement. Though I am male, I want to have his baby. I'm sure his manhood is impressive.

Seriously,  the service here was a joke today. my co workers (8 people total) took me here for my birthday lunch, big mistake. We were seated immediately, out on the patio, where it took about 15 mins for our waiter to come and take our order. We ALL ordered off the so called  lunch menu, which took 45 mins before the first dish arrived. During this time we asked about 15 times for refils on our water (everyone ordered water to avoid confusing refil orders) but to no avail. About 10 mins after the last bit of food was consumed, a waitress poked her head out of the door 20 feet away and shouted ""you guys want water?"" Didnt even come to our table to ask. So damn lazy. We asked for the check, our waiter asked if we wanted single checks for everyone, we said whatever was fastest we would take, he bragged about how smart he was by putting numbers next to our orders so he could split the check super quickly, we said ok to that. He left and never came back. 20 mins of waiting for the check we finally flagged down the manager, told her what was happening and how bad our experience had been, and she half heartedly apologized and said she was gonna give us some gift certificates for free meals in the future. She came back 5 mins later and told us she didnt have a gift certificates but would make take one dish off our total bill. Wtf. Seriously?  She clearly doesn't know what customer service is, nor does she care about getting return service. Anyways, the funny part was, my coworkers had ordered me a pazookie for my bday, that the absent minded waiter brought out to the table after we literally had already got up and started walking to the door, he looked at us weird and said ""so you guys dont want your pazookie anymore?""

Everything was great here besides the service; however, the manager sees this and is genuinely working on improving this, at least I hope. Our server was initially good: she took our order, got us our drinks, and continued to refill our drinks. Nonetheless, as time progressed her enthusiasm dwindled. After we got our pizzas she basically disappeared - at times she walked by us and completely ignored us. This was a bit saddening, as we couldn't fully enjoy our pizza without the parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, ranch, or refills. Granted, this might sound like we were overreacting, but if you're going to pay $24 per pizza, you want to be able to enjoy it to the max. Furthermore, I tried giving our waitress the benefit of the doubt, but there was a family right next to us who was getting quality service and all her attention,  so we couldn't understand why we were being ignored. Finally, my friend got up and went and talked with the manager. We got a new waitress almost immediately and everything was set right: cheese, pepper, ranch, and refills all came speedily. This would have been enough to satisfy us. The big surprise came when we got the bill. The manager essentially discounted our appetizers ($17 value).  We appreciated this kind gesture because it displayed effort on the managers part.  I'm giving a 3 star because the original waitress was horrible and it affected our entire experience.

This past weekend my friend decided to have a group lunch for about 20 people. I had a bad feeling but hoping I was wrong, and was I? Nope! So if you have a large group, half of the group has be present, makes sense no issue there. I kindly asked the waitress to change the channel to the NHL Heritage Classic (Senators vs. Canucks). She said she'd check with her manager, fair enough but didn't bother to get back to us. My friend had to ask another waitress, and guess what it got changed. Just say no, if you don't want to do it (Haha). BJ's is known for their pizza, but I decided to choose something else - Mahi Mahi Tacos. Oh boy, bad decision! The Mahi Mahi is a new menu item and needs to be removed from the menu. The tacos were not flavorful, chicken was undercooked, and just plain disgusting. I should of went with the overpriced pizza or just stayed away from all the food menu items. The group ordered various items from burgers to pizzas. My friend sitting next to me ordered a calamari sample, and that was horrible as well. It wasn't only me because she told prior to me trying it wasn't good. When it came time for the bill, the waitress added 3 ""Scooby Snacks"" to our bill, which we didn't order. Thankfully we checked the bill before just handing our credit cards over. The waitress asked us if we wanted to close out with here or pass it someone else. We told her we would with her since she was the server and guess who shows up someone else. So we had to re-explain the bill to her and ensured $5 was taken off because I had an online coupon. Why ask if you are going to do what you want? Moving right along, it was an unpleasant experience. BJ's will not be on my list to have a drink or get a bite. FYI - the HH menu sucks. It shouldn't be called HH. This place is overrated, avoid. Go down to TGIF's.

The waitress looked very annoyed with answering any questions we had.  I'm pretty sure she was new.  We waited for about an hour to get seated, another hour to get our food and another hour to figure out how to pay.  My boyfriend also asked for some hot sauce and ranch and by the time they brought it to him, he was pretty much done with the food.  The waitress didn't really bother to bring us refills either.  My friends had to ask for refills and had to wait at least 20 minutes for them.  She never asked me if I wanted another refill, so I was just over it and didn't want to wait any longer.  We each wanted to pay for our own orders separately and most of us had our debit cards.  When we told the waitress, she said we could only split the check 2 ways.  After my boyfriend argued with the manager, he let us split it 3 ways. It was all just a huge mess.  They made it more complicated than it should have been.  How can you not do split checks??  This waitress didn't know what she was doing.  We each had to figure out how we were gonna pay it all in 3 checks and after we paid, the waitress comes over and tells us we still owe money.  I looked over the receipt thinking how that was possible and they had over charged us.  She finally fixed it and then came back saying we needed to pay the tax still.  By this point we were all beyond ready to leave.  None of us even felt like leaving a tip, since the service was so bad.  We all left one anyways.  After what seemed like forever, we finally got it all taken care of and left.  I don't think I'll ever be returning.  The pizza is expensive and tastes pretty mediocre.  It's really nothing special.  As for the service, this is the 2nd time I go to a BJ's (last time was the one on Jamboree) and the service has never really been good.  I understand this is a pretty new location, but they have A LOT to work on.  We were all so frustrated.  I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=780,2.96,2.89,2.89,2.116,2.918

I told her ""for appetizer we will have the California club pizza"" then can I have a bacon cheese burger with no pickles she asked me how I wanted my burger and I told her well done. It seemed like forever to get our appetizer.  Please note brittney did not write or take notes of anything we ordered.  We finally got our drinks but never got our appetizer since they brought us our food first. My hamburger was not well done! It was pink. I would have returned it but I just ate it. Brittney was more involved giving her customer service to the bigger parties especially to the table who had a guy that was a sales car person. She was more interested in making tips. She barely came to our table since we were in the middle tables. She refilled their cups of water 2-3 times while my bf and I were there, and only came once to see if we wanted anymore drinks and my bf said he wanted another beer. Well that beer took forever!  I understand that maybe she had 4 tables to assist but my boyfriend and I agreed that her service was better with the others, that had a bigger party. And this time him and I both agreed that she deserved $0 for her tip. & that's what she got I would have talked to the manager but why make a big deal out of it I'll just post it on yelp. Note to Britnney: please write down customers orders and attend them even when u have a big party. $ is $ and we would have tipped you well if you did a great job but u didn't you practically ignored us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=480,2.8,2.94,2.94,2.148,2.884

We then watched as all the parties before us and even parties after us got their tables. You'd think that would be because we had requested a table outside but we sat there for about 20 mins watching about three tables outdoors sit empty with dirty dishes on them as all the employees just walked by them and completely disregarded clearing them off. I also saw an employee walking around on her phone carrying a rag. And to make matters worse all the employees were gathered inside talking and laughing. Then when we finally got our table and ordered our food, my husbands salad came early and was only the size of a side salad. I would expect a Cesar salad to be much larger for the price.

But in reality, the food is crap. What's the point of even having a happy hour menu, if the items are gonna be this half-ass?

At least you won't feel insulted when they bring you the cheapest constructed food known to man, that they call their happy hour food. Also, our server was a douche.

So our host walked us over to our table and then mentioned to us that our server will be with us shortly. Normally when I go to restaurants, servers come over to greet and ask for our drinks within 3-5 minutes, maybe less than that, but our server took about 20 minutes. I had to walk to the front desk to remind them that we've been waiting for someone to take our order. Finally, we had a server. Yay! We're finally going to get our drinks and food. When we got our food, another server brought it to us but immediately walked away without giving us napkins and utensils. I looked around for others servers, perhaps they have extra utensils, but of course they were all occupied, I'm not going to wait another 5 minutes for them to bring us some. Again, I walked over to front desk and asked for them. I know this is a long review, I'm almost done. I ordered the Extra Hot wings, however, the wings I got were not spicy at all. At this point, I was fed up with this place, I didn't even bother to let them know that they took my order wrong and had given me the traditional wings instead.  Food: Not that great.

I didn't feel welcome and maybe it was the fact that our server was more focused on bigger parties to get the biggest tip possible. It would be nice to get good service by trying to make your customer feel welcomed and perhaps she will get more tips.

Then the crispy veggie flatbread pizza was only crisp on edges and kinda soggy and limp in the middle - I eat a lot of pizza and a lot of vegetarian and this did not measure up.

We had the perfect beginnings, sliders and wontons to start. Meh. Nothing disgusting, nothing worth eating again. At the table we had the ribs (too soft, tasted fake and precooked) Deep dish and hand tossed pizzas (pale, too much crust, no sauce, dry, toppings cut so thin I could not taste anything on any of the 3 pizzas) I had the salmon, salty, tasted like out of a can, with couscous, which was little noodle balls, nothing grainy or healthy at all with veggies, really really bad.

Only once did he check on is during our meal and the table was overflowing with dishes since he never removed our appetizer or our main dish plates once empty.  Then there was the food.  My husband and I each ordered a deep dish pizza and both were pretty substandard compared to what we are use to receiving at Bj's. Some slices were huge while others were a tiny sliver and it was 3/4 crust with a small circle of toppings in the very middle which made the pizza very soggy since everything was concentrated in one spot. Then at the end of the meal we asked for 3 pizzokies... Meaning the trio however our server brought out 3 separate and large pizzokies which upped our bill another $20 so that was sucked but partially our fault since we must not have communicated what we wanted well enough.  My mother in-law ordered salmon and seemed happy with her meal so at least one of us enjoyed our meal.

So I asked the waiter to take it back. When my sandwich came back, it had no avocado. So they took it back again. By this time I was just annoyed and lost my appetite.

However, my experience here made me sit down and write a review because the service was something else. We were a party of 6, 4 adults and 2 children, but 2 of us arrived first. I told the hostess that there would be 6 total, 4 adults and 2 children. There were 3 people standing behind the hostess desk and apparently the request to seat 4 adults and 2 children was a lot to handle. They just looked at each other like they had never heard of such a mixed group. There was another party that was behind us so the hostess told us, ""move to the side there are people behind you."" Ummmm ok. So they finally take us to a table and give us 6 regular menus. Again, I said there will be 4 adults and 2 children. Does this type of request not happen much? Our server came by and we asked for waters while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. They must have gone all the way to a sacred spring for this water because it took forever to get to us. We ordered our drinks and when the server brought them over he couldn't tell the difference between 2 of them. At this point, I'm thinking, ""you're kidding me"". We started with appetizers, but were never brought plates to share or napkins or silverware. Apparently this was Medieval Times and we were supposed to use our hands and perhaps, our feet. When we asked for plates and napkins and silverware, they had to scramble to find us stuff. I mean, they literally brought 2 plates and napkin sets at a time. When all of our food finally arrived, they forgot one dish and the server couldn't even remember what it was. Also, my friend's shrimp tacos were a little cold and when the runner brought the food out he didn't know and couldn't identify what we ordered. This happened, ""Uhhhh this is pizza with pesto orrrr something"". It actually wasn't.  So here's the deal. I normally don't have an issue with BJ's. It is what it is. This location though, I'd go to one of the other restaurants in The Block.

Anyway, the food was good, waited about twenty minutes at most. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, well with my order at least. I had the Cajun Pasta lunch combo with Caesar salad. I love spicy and my waitress added more Cajun spices for me. There was no kick in the beginning, but the spiciness builds up as you eat. Service is somewhat slow, my friend waited half an hour to get a refill on her water. Oreo pizooki was okay, too sweet for my taste, I prefer normal chocolate chip pizooki.

Tried to cut one, but they were so undercooked, the mushy dough just squirted out like warm butter. When the waiter came back, they said that's the way they cook them here. Uhh, no. The oil wasn't hot enough and they were severely undercooked. They offered another, but it had taken so long to get the first round, I passed. Food took a long time to come out. The wait staff tried to keep our glasses full, but we wanted food. It was busy, but they were well staffed - at least on the floor.  Second time, got seated right away. Drinks and app came out fast. Food followed and everything was on point. It wasn't busy though. Third time, drinks came right away, but after that things slowed way down. They did get the corn fritters right this time. Nice and crispy outside, light and fluffy inside. Food took awhile to come out, but it's usually done right.  Bottom line, this location is inconsistent for service and food quality.

The hostess was calling out the wrong names (don't know why they are calling names when they have out pagers) Then a dad and son came up with lite buzzer and they took it and said ""oh sort we gave you the wrong one"" and gave them another one and sent them away. Kinda messed up. We sat down and right away we got new server, turned out we got the one that does laps but doesn't bring refills or remembers your drinks. It was a complete pain to get his attention to try and get even our water refilled.  So our spin dip arrives, they just forgot the flavor with it. We get this as a staple at BJ's and this one just lacked salt and flavor, we were seasoning our own food. The app went and again we were wishing our server would come by for any kind of refill.  On to entrées. Again messed up, my wife's gluten free pizza had extra white onions that she didn't order and was missing the artichokes she had asked for, but she was willing to live with it. (They still charged us on the bill for them, unreal) My dish was all kinds of lack of caring. I had for the honey lemon scallops. The scallops were over cooked on one side, rubbery and bland. The asparagus is limp and lame. The rice was as if it came off the bottom the of the pan, it was dried our hard and clumped together... And you guessed it missing the flavoring honey-lemon flavoring.  We got the manager, he could obviously see that my dish was a careless, rushed failure.  He offered a refire, which I took because I was starving and it wasn't a big dish to begin with. It took another 10 mins and wow what a difference, scallops looked better, asparagus was better, rice was flavored but under cooked (at least it wasn't a solid bunch of rock hard rice). I'll never be back to this location, they over charged, lacked any sort for lack of a better word...caring. No credit for two messed up dishes or lack of service.

It was a hot day and I thought it was a great idea to get a frosty drink and perhaps a pizza.  The location is beautiful and bustling.  Seated right away, already noticing not much air conditioning, not so great. Had a first day waiter but he had his trustee trainer along for the ride.  We ordered the handcrafted sodas which took some time to arrive and tasted great but were served with NO ICE, WHAT?  I ordered an individual pizza with a topping you can't get just anywhere: roasted brussels sprouts and a wedge salad.  My friend ordered the ribs and asparagus.  First the wedge comes out on a plate the size of a small teacup saucer, hanging all over the edges.  If you're a wedge salad fan you know you need to cut it up to eat it, right?  No room on this wanna-be plate to do anything.  So I waited for my pizza to come so I could use that plate.  The pizza comes, it is all misshapen, sort of like a hexagon where the two halves were sliding in different directions.  The waiter says ""Oh, sorry, they were playing around with it back there in the kitchen.""  WTF?  Okay, the shape shouldn't matter if it tastes good, yes?  No sauce, little sausage and the star of the show brussel sprouts were  only cut in halves and burnt like bad toast.  No flavor, little rocks, they were.  I ate enough to make room on my plate for the salad and ate the rest of that.  Over on my friend's plate, the asparagus were skinny and so limp it was sad.  She did say she enjoyed the ribs.  First time I have not taken the rest of a pizza home!!

275,Reneesha R.,"Anaheim, CA",70,65,14.0,2.0,2014-07-20,"I've eaten at a number of BJ's locations, and this is by far the worst. What a shame.  I came here right after I got off of work from a store in the mall I just wanted a nice cool drink and a pizza to wind down from a long day at work. It was about an hour from closing, so I did not expect any problems. I made a note to the hostess that my boyfriend was on his way and was using crutches, so she seated me accordingly. So I sat alone for awhile hoping the server would come around and get me a drink while I waited. However, she didn't show up until 15 minutes later when my boyfriend had already arrived.  So I ordered the berry burst cider and a Jeremiah red for my other half. Then we ordered the BJ's classic pizza in a shareable size (14 inches). The drinks came first. It kind of took awhile for them to arrive, but when they did, they were ice cold and delicious. Then we waited for the pizza. That also took awhile. When it arrived, my boyfriend and I looked at each other and gave a look of 'this isn't quite right'. The pizza looked small and was quite misshapen. It was also cut horribly.  We called the server over to make sure we actually got the shareable pizza rather than the individual (which is 11 inches). She assured us that it was the correct size and even counted the slices (the shareable is supposed to have 10 slices while the individual has 6 slices, but come on, you can cut 10 slices in a smaller pizza and call that the bigger one, which is what I believe they did). Kind of bs considering that the shareable is $20 while the individual is $13, so we completely got ripped off.  So we ate the whole thing fairly quickly, which is much different than all the other times we've ordered pizza from BJ's. Usually we have some leftover to take home even when we are super hungry, but not this time. Then, for some reason unknown to me now, we ordered dessert. I wanted the new peanut butter smores pizookie, but my boyfriend didn't want to get it here because they ""might f**k that up too."" So we got the new peach cobbler instead. That ALSO took way longer to come out than expected, which by this time was just getting ridiculous because there was barely any people in the restaurant when I got there and I know the kitchen wasn't shutting down yet, so there was honestly no excuse for food to be coming out so slowly.  While I do have a complaint about the cobbler, I don't believe it's the fault of this particular BJ's. All the components eaten together made it taste like a mouthful of ginger. Perhaps that's my palette, but it just tasted off to me.  I'm seriously not a picky person, especially when it comes to food and I tend to give services the benefit of the doubt, but I hold BJ's to a certain standard having eaten there so many times. If you're going to charge $7 extra for 3 more inches on the pizza, it damn well better be the right size and not look like the chef just smacked it down on a plate and haphazardly sliced it. And please train the staff! It seems like they were all new hires with no experience in serving or cooking. While the decor was just lovely, everything else felt flat.  I think we'll just stick to the Cerritos location where the manager, Ulf, is a sweetheart who cares about the guests and the servers give you an enjoyable experience.

My bf and I decided to go to BJ's in Orange yesterday at 3pm to celebrate my new job. We ordered calamari and corn fritters for appetizers and those were delicious and came out to us in no time. Disaster struck when our small half bbq chicken pizza and half bj's favorite pizza was brought to out table. Melissa M. our server placed it on the table and my bf and I spoke up and said the bbq chicken side does not look right. It was missing cilantro and red onions. And her solution was to bring us some cilantro but said if it tasted weird she would replace it for us. My bf and i were starving so we decided to just try it anyway since the other half was okay. IT WAS DISGUSTING. Worst pizza ever and you could not even taste the bbq sauce. When Melissa came back to check on us we told her it was disgusting and said, ""I'm sorry guys that sucks,"" and walked away. As a loyal customer to BJ's for 4years it was extremely insulting.

642,Madiya M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,53,7.0,1.0,2014-08-13,"Let me start by saying that I've been coming to BJs for a while now.. 5 years to be exact. And I've noticed a continued decline in their customer service over the years. But this location has to be one of the worst ones I've encountered yet! I give it a 1 star because the manager ""tried"" to rectify the problems (plural) Short version: rude staff (hosts and servers combined), major communication issues between servers and cooks which results in incorrect orders, inability to cater to large parties and lastly, slow inconsistent service! Long version: Party of 20.. Took about an 1:40 minutes just to be seated (random Tuesday with half the restaurant empty) not a big deal.. Since there were 20 of us, we entertained each other outside on a beautiful evening. Once we get seated, we get introduced to Juan and the drinks start rolling in. We order apps and while they tasted good, they took about 40 mins to come out to us. We ordered about 4 spinach and artichoke dips, all of them were half empty. No worries, we ask the waiter to fill them up. He takes the dips away and disappears for another 20 mins while the chips get cold. And the only reason it took 20 mins was because we had to remind him. Food starts coming out (most of the orders were wrong). And then were told the missing dishes would be on their way (another 20 mins) so half the party was eating and the other half was watching. Our waiters response ""umm yah this was big party"" so ur establishment can't cater properly to a big party? The biggest failure of the night, bits of pepperoni on vegetarian pizzas that we accidentally ate!!!! Any vegetarian will tell u how big of a no no that is. Not only was our meal ruined but our snooty waiter tells us ""oh that happens sometimes since the toppings are next to each other"" ummmm wat???? That's the best bs u can come up with??

Our server is best described as uncaring.  We didn't have silverware and we had to ask twice before getting it after the food had already come out.  We asked her to take a picture of the group and she said in a minute, then went to other tables and didn't come back.  When she came back, of course she forgot and the moment was over. We ordered: 2 orders of wings, corn fritters, angel hair pasta, a Medium BBQ chicken pizza and a BJ's specially pizza. The wings are good as always, my favorite.  The corn fritters are slightly over fried and on the verge of turning burnt.  The angel hair pasta is over cooked to a point of mushiness and violating the cardinal rule of pasta.  Both pizzas were undercook and doughy.   The pizza needed to stay in the oven for a few more minutes.  We immediately brought it up to our server, who offered to have kitchen put it back in the oven.  After realizing we were not happy with her response she asked if we wanted to see the manager, we told her yes. The manager is very nice and offered to re-make the pizzas right away.  15 minutes  later, fresh ones were brought out.  The dough was better but the pizza didn't taste very good.  It's nowhere near comparable to the HB location.  At this point, we all regretted and vowed to only go BJ's in HB moving forward.  Throughout, the manager came back a few times to check up on us.  He offered us complimentary dessert on the house as an apology.  We had the undeniably delicious pizookie.  Because of the manager's efforts, i gave it a 3 stars, otherwise would have been a 1 star.

The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the lettuce was all fresh and crisp. The sauces combined were excellent on the wraps! I had the mahi mahi tacos and they were ok. Fish was cooked well but the tortillas were really dry. One friend had the chipotle salmon and she really enjoyed it. She said it had more heat than she had planned but she still liked it. My other friend had the hawaiian mahi mahi and she also enjoyed her dish. Enough so that she ate much more than she normally does. We finished with the peanut butter smores pizookie.

I work down the street from this new bjs and ordered a California chicken sandwich (which they no longer have it's a California chicken club now) on the curbside take out for my 30 minute lunch break. I got the sandwich and it was completely the wrong sandwich, not even close. So I went back in and talked to the lady at the to-go station. It took FOREVER for me to get my sandwich (mind you I only have a 30 minute lunch.) When I did get the sandwich I started to drive over to my work which is literally down the street and I only had about 10-15 minutes to eat now so I started to eat on the way back to work.

Because they were tiny straight hairs, it could have been mistaken for pubes. So extremely upset and NOW NOT ABLE TO EAT FOR 8 HOURS, I went back to the manager who went back to the cooks and said there were no cooks there with that color hair so she had no idea where it came from. She gave me a 30 dollar gift card and offered me a free salad or soup to go since I had not eaten on my lunch but I just didn't have time. SO THERES MORE.

289,James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1105,935,1830.0,1.0,2014-09-18,"After swearing off BJ's after my dining experience at the Huntington Beach location (on Beach and Edinger), I hesitantly found myself at a different BJ's restaurant to meet up some friends. Unfortunately, this one was the same story. Strike #1: a hostess told us it was happy hour and instructed us to sit in the bar area. When we asked the waiter whether it was happy hour, that notion was struck down immediately... hm ok. This was really minor compared to Strike 2 and 3. Strike #2: the food was underwhelming. The fish (for the fish and chips dinner) was very oily- there was nothing light about the batter as described. At points, it was just easier to peel away the batter and eat the fish inside. I wish this dish came with coleslaw or something pickled because after a couple of bites, it would be difficult for anyone to take in all that oil/grease. My friend got their spicy spaghetti which I took a few bites of- holy moly, there wasn't anything remotely spicy to it. In fact, you could call it a bland spaghetti. Fortunately, generous portions of parm and red chili flakes somewhat saved the dish, but by then, it felt like we prepared the meal with how much we had to add to the dish. Sorry for all of you Chef Boyardee fans out there, but I'd rather have a can of that at home than order this again. Strike #3: service was painstakingly slow (around 9pm on a Wednesday). It was difficult to flag our waiter, it seemed like he was trying to avoid our table or something. When we asked another server to get us ketchup, she straight up dogged us and made it very apparent we were inconveniencing her... and here we were asking someone else in the hopes that our request would come out a bit quicker. Alas, when we were trying to retreat from the restaurant, it took a total of 30 minutes (yes, by this point we felt so inclined to time it) from the time the check came out to our table until we were able to get our bill paid.  So really, I have been so let down by you BJ's. When you were at your prime, I really enjoyed it but lately, it just has been a huge disappointment. The last time I wrote a review and was contacted by someone willing to make it right, I actually responded but never heard back- their customer service in general is just beyond me. I have zero intentions on bringing my business back here and hope you steer clear too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=280,2.32,2.53,2.53,1.8600000000000003,2.4459999999999997
621,Adam J.,"Garden Grove, CA",47,20,1.0,2.0,2014-09-19,"Pretty disappointing experience here. We've been going to the Huntington Beach BJ's for years but just moved to this side of town and decided to come here for dinner. To begin, the service was pretty poor. Refills were slow, and at one point someone took my drink and didn't refill it before the main course had arrived. When food arrived, he left without giving utensils and napkins for the table. My sister got a buffalo chicken pizza and it came with more bbq sauce than buffalo... And when we asked about it, they explain that's how it's made. Again, we've been going to the Huntington Beach location for YEARS, and never has it come with bbq sauce on the buffalo pizza. That doesn't even make sense and it certainly doesn't say anything about it on the menu. Our pizzuki got here before the corrected food did.

The service however was TERRIBLE. We got water while we reviewed the drink menu to make our cocktail decisions. While it was humorous when the waiter accidentally poured iced tea into my husbands water to refill it, that was the beginning of the horrible service. We waited for about 20 minutes after beers were ordered for the beer to be brought to the table. Then after the beer was finally delivered it took about 20 more minutes for our order to even be taken and only after flagging down the waiter. The food came out in average time, however the pizza was delivered, then 15 minutes later came the plates, once again after flagging down the waiter. My Irish Root Beer was ordered before the food, then I had to order it again when we asked for plates for our pizza. Not sure what happen or why it was like this, the restaurant wasn't very busy.

They looked confused did some side chatter and finally decided who it would be to take care of us. He was very pleasant- but maybe the hostess ladies need to communicate it better with the server before we get seated and way 15 minutes to be attended to...

Ordered BJ's favorite w no olives and it came out to be completely different pizza. They fixed it...bringing out BJ'S favorite w olives..... manager asked for our opinion...told him what happen n they did apologize n gave us free desert. 2nd time Me and my friend each ordered an ahi salad and finished it.  Our server walked by and stated ""dang you killed the plate didn't you. "" she smiles then said ""I'm going on my break should I grab your check?""  I felt she just wanted the entire tip and rushed us to pay.  also, you shouldn't comment whether someone finished their food...that's just rude! 3rd time sat down 20 minutes & no server. Was sick of waiting so I flagged someone down to order our food and drink.

She brought it back in and few minutes later our server came to us blaming the kitchen stating she put in Cobb salad. We finished our pizza waited n waited and finally Cobb salad came out w the wrong dressing.  Gal A then apologized stating our server had written down house salad before. (This is a HUGE deal. Shows this place has no teamwork and everyone points finger). Manager then walks over & asked for our opinion on their services. Both my bf n I didn't want to say anything but he noticed we didn't touch our salad. My bf decided to tell him what happened n he wanted to give us free desert. We told him no thanks. We then flagged down our server and she still acted innocent. ""What kind of desert do you want? It's on me!"" We told her no thanks. She then states ""it's free! U don't want free desert?""

Next my group of 5 ordered some beers with the exception of 1 he is under 21, the server then got us the beer and took down our food order, next thing we know he accused us of giving our under age friend our beer simply because the beer was near him!

Then another 15 minutes to even get our drinks (not even alcoholic so no reason for the long wait).  By the attitude of our waiter, Tony,  he was obviously having a bad night and was walking around socializing.

Some the same first server (not our own) brought us our appetizers and we just decided to order from him because it was a while since we've seen Calvin. Then another server brought us our food and we ate. Food was good but nothing will raise this 1 star due to the service. Calvin still failed to serve us but had time to serve all his tables around us. He then came back and. Without even asking us how we're doing, asked how many boxes we needed and we just said 3. He dropped them off and walked away. We spoke to the manager and just told him we weren't satisfied with our server Calvin and he apologized. Calvin then took our check and didn't split it like we asked then when he returned he literally THREW the check over my shoulder and it plopped on our table and he walked away without saying a word.

We ask our waiter at the bar if tailgate happy hour is going on in the dining room. He says it is going on the whole restaurant. We decide to just sit at the bar because the server at least understand that tailgate happy hour was going on throughout the restaurant.

Three times other servers bring food to our table that is for the table next to us. They're nice though even with whatever communication problem is going on. The food and drinks are all fine.

Our lunch came and the food was very disappointing.  The tacos were dry, probably from sitting under the heat lamps while my friends food was being prepared.  No big deal as I was really there to see my friend, not for the food.   Then the bill came...she charged me $9.50 for the tacos instead of the menu price of $5.75!  I asked another employee about it, as my server had already left, and she said the extra $4.00 was for the fish.  I was shocked!!  I specifically ordered ""lunch tacos""...

(apparently lunch tacos are only chicken which I would have been fine with).   I did not want to get into an uncomfortable situation with my friend there so I paid the bill, left her a very small tip and wrote a note on the ticket telling her I didn't appreciate the 'bait and switch' game she just pulled on me. Be prepared if you go in to BJs, she was a master at how she manipulated this situation, almost doubling the price of my lunch...so disappointing!  My friend and I will be finding another place to meet in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=520,2.12,2.35,2.624,2.6600000000000006,2.2580000000000005

I went here with my boyfriend for a romantic date and while our waitress was really sweet and the food was decent, the behavior and attitude of the hostesses that were at the front soured the whole experience.  I understand getting friendly with your coworkers and talking to each other during your down time but they were extremely inattentive and rude. We walked in and they barely paid any attention to us and kept talking to each other and then when they finally noticed us one of the girls just dropped us at the nearest table and rushed back to finish her conversation without saying anything to us.  This Bj's would have better reviews  if they trained their staff properly and reminded them that they are there to work and not to socialize.

The first time I went was for dinner and I received excellent service. My server was very attentive and checked up on us constantly. I wasn't sure about which salmon dish to order, but my server was very detailed in explaining about each dish so I ended up getting the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon because it was on the sweeter and saucier side rather than the buttery baked Atlantic Salmon. It was about $15 and I was very happy with my choice! The second time I went was for lunch with a large group of nine people and our server was excellent also. I ordered the classic bacon burger for about $11. For dessert, of course you have to order a pizookie! They have about 8? 9? flavors of the pizookie. My favorite is the cookies n cream one! The regular single pizookie is about $7. It comes with the baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top and whip cream.  I took off a star in my review for this place because one of my friends found a piece of hair in his pasta. It was taken back and redone but it took forever!

I felt like we jumped at him all at once, (not our intentions, but we were just so hungry) when we ordered just our drinks, desserts (yes, we eat our desserts before our meals) and appetizers. Only because we were talking all at once, BUT he got it all down. Anything we needed and asked for- he was there with it. Checked on us a few times after the food was served to make sure we were okay if anything else was needed.  After a few bites that my sister took into her jalapeno burger she noticed her meat was red after ordering well done (curr. pregnant), so we obviously wanted to make sure Christopher was aware of it. Again, we only wanted to make sure he was aware of it.

When we got there the rude hostess told us it would be about a 25 minute wait. Fine for a Saturday night. Once we were seated our waiter came right away to take drink orders which looking back on the evening was a miracle. He came back with the drinks and I asked him if I could get a water to go with my cocktail. That never came and I had to ask someone else that I saw 30 minutes later to bring it to me. Long story short we had to get the waiters attention for everything and he never once came to our table to check on us. Our plates sat at our table for a good 45 minutes after we were finished eating and we actually had to ask another server to take care of our bill because our waiter was nowhere to be found.

But in terms of price/size ratio, this was pretty awful. And the pizza was completely shoddily made. There was a bit of cheese on one part, a bit of tomato sauce on another, and couple of random vegetables randomly strewn in corners. Taste-wise it was OK. But for that price (and size!)

Because I eat there frequently I joined their rewards program. I have a smartphone app that let's me check In at the hostess so they know I'm in the rewards program and it keeps track of my points. What's really cool is the mobile pay feature. It let's you pay your check from your phone and just leave. At least in theory.  Today I had lunch with my family at this location. Checked in with my app at the hostess. We ordered and ate a tasty lunch. I asked the server to apply the $10 off I earned with reward points. I paid the boll with my mobile pay app. I even calculated the top I gave the server on the prediscounted amount. Didn't want to short him. My family and I leave to get in our car. WHY IS OUR SERVER CHASING US INTO THE PARKING LOT LIKE WE STOLE SOMETHING? Because he thought we skipped out on the check. I told him I used mobile pay. He wanted to see it on my phone. At that point, I got angry. I asked for the manager. After a protracted wait, a young lady came out to speak to me. I explained what happened and asked why I was chased into the parking lot by the server. She said ""sorry, he should have known you paid."" That's it. Thank you Captain Obvious!   Attention BJ's Corporate folks: You need to do a better job training your servers how to handle mobile pay transactions. Chasing your loyal customers into the parking lot after they pay their check really leaves a bad taste after a nice meal. And before you let anyone in your store represent themself as a manager, how about a little customer service  training. Just a little. The young lady I encountered had none.

I came here after work with some coworkers to celebrate my birthday. Might I add, we all work in a restaurant over at disneyland so we know the loops. Never have I ever had such terrible service in my life. As soon as we walked in we didn't feel welcomed at all and was told the table was going to be just a moment, to there was no tables, then it was going to be 30 minutes. Then there was immediate seating when our sixth person arrived and she asked for the table? Confused yet? So were we. Anyways it took Lucas, our absolutely awful server, twenty minutes to not even greet us but to rudely walk up to the table and ask ""what do you want to drink?"" As our time went on we never once received refills, plates, silver wear, napkins, anything. Nor did he ask us if everything was okay, which it obviously wasn't. This calamari was oddly off that night to say the least and we weren't pleased at all but he didn't know that until we asked to speak to a manger finally. After getting yelled at by his manager, he decided to bring us refills where we found spit, literally a lugie, in our soda. Never will I return to this Bj's even with the offer of a free recovery meal. Lucas was the most terrible, careless sever I have ever encountered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=720,2.72,2.59,2.608,2.308,2.6420000000000003

I asked about happy hour and the waitress went and got the hh menu for me. When she took our order,  I ordered  3 items from the hh menu. The girls ordered a burger and pizza and hubby had a pizza, too. She asked what I was having and I said I'm eating what I ordered from the hh menu. She brought out my order from the hh menu. Which was 5 buffalo wings and 2orders of avocado eggrolls. Which one order of eggrolls was for the girls to try. Everyone started eating my wings...grr! Ah, hello...those were my meal. Whatever...they were barely warm. Not good. It took forever for everyone's food to come out...like almost an hour. Then when it comes...its wrong. I was pissed to say the least. We had to leave soon and my neice was starving.  The reason why I was so pissed is because we stopped the waitress before putting in the order to inquire about what was on the burger my neice ordered and then she ends up with a completely different burger. I don't know many kids who would order a blue cheese burger.  The manager came to say sorry and offered dessert but we were running so late.  Then the bill comes and she doesn't apply the happy hour price. Ugh! They comp'd an eggroll order but it doesn't fix our dissappointment.

The server disappeared having done her duty in the failure of a ""team service""  concept. Fifteen minutes later the team food slinger plopped down the dish with the welcoming, cheerful and unconscious service-oriented phrase, ""lasagna?""  and then also quickly disappeared.  So quick after the fling that it was only then I realized I had no silverware, no napkin, no nothing. Really? Is this anyone's job ""on the team"" or am I supposed to eat with my hands? TEN minutes after staring at my food and trying to hail a ""food server"" of any kind from any where, the original food server - at least I think it was she, our interaction had been so brief 20 minutes earlier during the ""ordering"" phase - stops by and says ""Oh, they didn't bring you any silverware?""  No apology, no concern... really?  I was so disgusted tha all I could do was ask for a box.  I could have taken the now cold food home and reheat it myself.  And I have forks and napkins at home...  Then my good sense kicked in.  Hey, wait a minute... this is supposed to be a restaurant... I simply got up and left the cold, utensil-less, uneaten food on the bare table for the food server to figure out.  Maybe they could find a patron who brings their own utensils and napkins and a microwave and serve it to them.  She probably never knew; most likely the team busser came by and just threw the food and sinful service away. Really management?  This is your idea of training and service?

Our waitress, Toni, was great at the beginning. She went on break and then left Maria to wait on us. I'm sure Maria is a hard worker, but she is a hard worker who neglected our table. Our table was full of empty dishes, the pizza we ordered to go looked like someone shoved it in the box. We have enjoyed BJ's for almost 30 years and never saw a pizza boxed the way saw this pizza boxes. When we questioned Toni (who was now back from her break), she paused and didn't offer to just get another pizza made. We had to ask for one. In almost 30 years of eating BJ's in various states, we have always been offered whatever it was that needed correcting by the BJ's staff.  So I asked Mike, the manager, and he clarified that we should not have been asked and handled the situation in a very professional and respectful manner.

Instead, we all ended up leaving angry due to the sorry service we received.  It was on a Monday night and it wasn't exceptionally busy, yet it took 45 minutes to get a table. When we finally were seated there were six of us squished into a booth designed for 4, and a member of our party arrived shortly after us had to find a chair and pull it up herself to fit.  The waitress took forever to get our drink orders, and by that time happy hour was long gone. She was super rude when we asked about getting happy hour prices after waiting for her for so long, and in the end we only got one round at happy hour price. She had an annoyed, pissed off expression the entire time she was serving us. It's obvious that she hates her job. Soup and salads started to be brought to our table, and I thought ""oh, did you guys order appetizer salads?"", and they said ""no, this is all we ordered"". I thought it was really dumb that they would bring out the food at different times. Half our party had already finished eating by the time everyone else's food was brought out.  Our dirty dishes sat at our table the entire meal, our water glasses were never refilled, our waitress was impossible to track down. When finally someone made eye contact, we told her we wanted to order pizookie. The pizookie was brought out 20 minutes later. By this point I had enough, and sent it back because we were just anxious to get out of there.  Someone called over the manager, who was useless. He just stood there befuddled by the whole situation like he didn't even know how to do his job. When someone has a bad dining experience, you should be doing everything you possibly can to make it right. The manager finally cleared our table of dishes after we pointed it out to him, and we never saw our waitress the rest of the night. Our checks took an additional 15 minutes to get to us, and there was no discount, no offer to come back, no free appetizer, nothing. It was really disappointing, and a complete wet blanket on our night out. I can't remember the last time I received such crummy service at an industry that should be based on customer service.

We also noticed people seating outside... Which, the hostess explained to us that there was no servers outside. I asked to speak to a manager, because of that observation. Jesse, the manager on duty, came over, and I explained my frustration. He apologized, but his reasoning didn't seem to make sense.

Our waitress took our drink order, brought the drinks, put in our food order, then went home for the day and left us with another waitress. When they started bringing out the food we noticed our orders were all wrong. My nephews had ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with sides and were only brought small bowls of macaroni and cheese. When we let them know their order was wrong, she took away the mac and cheese and the kids didn't receive their food until we were more than halfway through our meals. My little niece never received her fruit side. Half of us ordered burgers and ordered them medium, when they got to us however they were burnt and dried out. My husband and my mother in law received the wrong burgers. They were dry with no sauces, as they were described in the menu. Our waitress came by twice in the beginning and that was it. We did not receive any refills so all of our drinks were gone by the middle of our meals. Overall I was very disappointed.

I hate being THAT person, but I was stern with the him and said the empty booth is fine. When the host directed another hostess to finally seat us, my mom asked why it took so long to get seated. I'm furious about the fact that (1) my mom was ignored and not given an answer, (2) the curly haired hostess rolled her eyes at my mom and had the indecency to not smile the entire time that she brought us to our table and give us our silverware and menus, and (3) its my mom's birthday TODAY...

I sure sign that it had been thrown in the microwave. The top was burnt and dry. The salad was covered in waterlike red substance and the lettuce once crispy was a soggy cooked mess. The watermelon chunks had shrunk to half their size and were hot, further proof that the entire plate had been thrown in the microwave without regard of how the crispy greens or watermelon would be affected. Frankly, I don't know why people work as chefs in a restaurant if the passion to cook is not in them. Why serve your customer something so gross?!

Don't feel guilty. I did but then it hit me: They didn't have the bad dining experience, YOU did. & you aren't taking home a $200+ tip-cash for working half-assed. They are. Other than that, great Pizookies. Final review: my burger came out on a cookie sheet, & you forgot my beer& side salad.

352,Dana M.,"Pasadena, CA",11,75,40.0,4.0,2015-09-28,"Ah. The restaurant chain with the pornographic name. Somewhere inside my head I feel a bit pervy when I offer ""BJs"" as a suggestion for a place to chow down. As I'm certain at least half the of the U.S. already knows what it's like to dine at one of their 159 locations, I'll strive to avoid repetition. As someone pretty much over the ""let's try new restaurants just for fun"" phase of my life, BJs and/or Yardhouse are generally the establishments I fall back on. Burgers, pizza, pasta, salads, beer, sandwiches...you know the drill. The chain is pretty consistent in terms of taste, quality (eh...that's 'sports bar' quality, not Jack's Bistro...), and vibe. If you actually want to talk to and hear the people/person you're with, keep in mind BJs has pretty raucous noise levels. Then again, if you're on a blind date with a real tampon, the decibel level could work in your favor.  This is the first time I've been to the Orange location...came here on Thursday after playing hooky from work to spend the afternoon at Sunset Beach. Located at the Block in Orange (now the City...I think), the parking may be a bit hairy depending when you go. Shopping center madness. But after the mass of calories you will most likely consume, it may not be such a bad thing to hoof it an extra half mile back to the car after dinner. Listed are some notable points from my most recent visit:  FOOD/BEER: -Avocado Egg Rolls - Deee-to-the-lish. -Pizza - I wanted to like it but it was only a meh. Couldn't decide so I got 1/2 Pepperoni Extreme and 1/2 Chicken Bacon Ranch. When I questioned our server about the CBR, he built up the taste sooooo much I felt mighty disappointed when it I discovered it to be practically void of taste. AVOID this one. Greasy and bready. Carbocide. Zzzzzzz. :( -If you're into IPAs - Go for Jeremiah Red. If you like something lighter - Go for the Lightswitch Lager. I generally fluctuate between the two, depending on my mood. :) -Check out the beer blends - 1/2 beer and 1/2 cider - saw this after I ordered my beer. Note to self: try next time. TIPS:  -BJs almost always has a guaranteed 20-30 min wait time. Don't feel like waiting? Try this: put your name down w/ the hostess, then scope out the first come, first serve bar area - they offer the same menu.

498,Andrea L.,"Orange County, CA",462,353,106.0,2.0,2015-12-07,Came here with my husband today and boy was I disappointed. Never left a BJs location with such regret. Found a hair in my food and the waitress reluctantly swapped it out. Managing to still charge us for it. Lol from all the places I've eaten at if theres a hair or insect in your food they will replace it and eat the cost. I was really nice about it but she didn't even seem apologetic about the incident. Ordered two Mojitos and the first one was great however the second time around it was extremely sweet. Completely off balanced from the initial beverage. We waited and waited for the waitress to come back however she was either extremely busy or she just did not want to come back and help us. I got fed up with waiting I brought it to the bartender and asked for a replacement. She asked who my server was and I told her she hasn't come around for the last 15 mins. After another 5 mins of waiting (still without my drink) another server comes to our table and asked if he could provide some assistance. I explained to him that there was an issue with the drink so he brought me a new one. Whenever I go to places that serve food and beverages I try to be as nice as possible since I don't like other peoples saliva in my food lol. But at this point it was just getting ridiculous. No one came around to ask if we needed any condiments or if we wanted to clear some of the (obviously empty) dishes off of our extremely tiny table. After the incident with the beverage I never saw the girl come out again. From then on it was just the male server who took care of us. I just find it a bit ironic since usually if a waiter goes on break or if there is a transition they usually come together to introduce the new person responsible for your table. Meh I guess you can't expect much for people who do not take their job seriously. The happy hour deal/hours have changed so if you're a veteran happy hour attendee for BJ's be aware of your orders.

Not the typical BJ's.  The employees seem angry and put out serving you which really makes for an uncomfortable dining experience.  I ordered a Pepsi and I could taste the aspartame and knew instantly it was a diet drink. I can't stand the after taste of any diet beverage and I recognized it instantly. I asked the server if I could get regular because I accidentally received diet. She was instantly annoyed and offended. The second drink tasted the same. I had my son, daughter and husband taste it and they all confirmed it was definitely diet. I literally did not want to tell the server because I knew it would be a problem.  When she came back I asked for an ice tea and said there was still something wrong with it. She got very defensive stating aggressively it was regular Pepsi causing my whole family to respond that it was definitely diet. I said I can definitely taste the aspartame but maybe the lines were switched to the machine.  She seemed baffled by that comment and my husband and I both said we used to work in a restaurant where that happened often, but either way, can I just get an ice tea? Begrudgingly I got a tea. My husband ordered broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl which had 3 full spoonfuls of soup. Total waste of money there. He asked for crackers to go with the soup and never received them. The final cherry on the cake was the server talking to other employees and pointing  at our table and laughing.  Keep laughing because eventually you won't have a job when you no longer have customers.  I won't ever come back to this location. It's expensive enough eating out and tipping a crappy server.  Why waste my hard earned money on this type of service. We could not wait to get out of there.

That being said, the food was OK, had the hickory brisket and bacon burger; which was decent and the plate seemed to lack more fries..who doesn't expect more fries? The pene pasta didn't seem overwhelming in size either; for portion pricing of 12-16 for plates, you might expect more.

She's easy going, knows her stuff, and is fun to talk to. The food and drinks she suggested were spot on as well. First, I decided on the Harvest Hef, which offered subtle notes of banana and clove, tasty! We started with the lettuce wraps and loved the wasabi mustard sauce. We then split two lunch specials -- the spaghetti and meatballs and the salmon with roasted veggies and quinoa. Both were outstanding, the portions were generous, and we especially loved the spice level of the meatballs. It was then time for an after lunch cocktail. Feeling conflicted.. Alisha was again to my rescue! Being in one of those fickle ""sweet"" but ""not so sweet"" moods, she suggested The Pink Cadillac, which was a match in martini heaven for me. Being in the industry myself, it's usually pretty difficult to leave me impressed as I'm always thinking of what I would have done better.

I got to the restaurant, and it was not busy (dine-in and takeout), yet it took ten minutes to pay and retrieve my order. Chelsea was incredibly slow in getting my order and didn't even offer me utensils like the other customer before me.  There was another customer who came in five minutes after me and was helped first. Two managers/shift leads came by and still didn't offer help.  I scratched the hell off the space where you can tip the server because that was just the saddest service I have ever seen.  Fortunately, the pastas were one of the best.

The people who did receive their food at my table couldn't start eating because we had no utensils. We finally flag down somebody for utensil and it took way too long for them to get back. They have a promotional deal on pazookies that we requested. We we're told that it was only one pazookie per table when on the promotional ad it says per check and we were all paying separately. Then we were avoided for another 20 minutes until they brought the last dish to our table. We flagged down our waiter and asked to speak to a manager. The manager takes another 20 minutes to approach and she seemed like she had a bad attitude the minute she approached our table. We told her about the poor service and how unsatisfied we were with it. She apologized grudgingly and offered us boxes for our food. She judged wanted us to leave which seemed pointless for us because we just got our food. We then asked her to put in the order for all of our pazookies ( this is the second time asking because we had already told our original waiter sam to do it) and she gives us the "" it's only one per table but because of how long the wait was I will do that"". I wasn't going to further argue that she wasn't doing me a courtesy and that she obviously had no clue what the promotional ad promised. 15 minutes later we ask another waiter to get us our waiter since we were being avoided. Now we have a new waiter and we asked him about our pazookie order that was suppose to be put in by the manager. This is our third time ordering the pazookies and we are being constantly told that it's ""almost"" out. We asked for our check and again we were avoided for another 20 minutes. Then the waiter comes with no pazookies and only our check. We never got the pazookies and it was ridiculous how the manager handled the whole situation.

The salad dressing cup was covered in dressing before I even opened it. No biggie.  Steak time! I ordered it medium. It was burnt, hard as a rock and dry on the inside. The meat was white like an old pork chop. I love char but I wanted it to be at least somewhat juicy! Now I'm trying to cut it with my plastic knife and fork and it was really hard. Like so difficult that I ended up just sticking a fork in it and eating it like a savage. Steak on a stick. I like beef jerky so that worked.  Pretty bummed. I didn't want to take it back because my bra was already off.  My experiences here so far had been excellent. I prefer BJs when I'm craving steak because it's usually done right and priced good and they have asparagus (but bring back the green beans!). Maybe I need to order rare from now on.

When my date arrived at 1030 pm they didn't have the reservation I made at 10pm. So ball dropped there, but they made good and seated her. Now on top of that we preferred the chicken ranch pizza with the dinner for two special that's being promoted. It comes with 2 soups, a medium pizza, and a pizzuki.  Now the chicken pizza had way too much cilantro and it was clumped weirdly all over. I saw right away that this would make it inedible and my date hates cilantro. I had to ask them to take it back, this they did reluctantly. My date was sure that they would spit in the food and I assured her that this was not the case in such a big and busy kitchen.  Also my date had ordered the creamy broccoli soup and by her face when she tasted it, I could tell that it was disgusting. She had mentioned it was Luke warm. I'm just glad that we didn't get food poisoning.

I've been here 3 times and every time it disappoints. The first time I came was to celebrate my birthday and they took about 45 minutes to seat us (4) and took about another 45 to bring out our main dishes. Second time I came I order some shrimp pasta and the shrimp still had its shell! Third time I came which was a few days ago, I knew I had enough of this place. I really wanted to like this place but not after the service we received. We walked in to check in and the host looked so miserable, does she not know her job description? She was so unwelcoming and monotone but either way I decided to look past it. We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated and the guy that took us to our table just sat us down and was like your server will be here and walked away, he too looked like he hated his job. So finally our server comes and it's this young girl, she asks us what we'd like to drink and that was it, not once did she greet us or anything. We knew what we were going to get, which was the 2 for $25 deal. So we tell her and when she asks what pizza I had no idea that we had a choice I thought maybe it was like a preselected one, which I proceeded to ask her if it could be any and she's like well yeah, with some snippy attitude. She then walks away so we could have ""time to look at the choices"" which wasn't necessary at all because there weren't a lot to choose from. So the food comes out and what not and she comes to tell us she's going on lunch and that this other girl will no be our sever. This new girl was more positive and attentive.

But this time, at this particular restaurant, we ordered the Sweet Pig and the normal cheese, and what we got was quite different from what we're used to. Sweet Pig: everything looked right, but the crust was soggy, spongy, and oily.  I think the pizza 1). didn't cook long enough, or 2). cooked too slowly, soaking up too much oil.  Texture: like eating a sponge. Taste: canola oil The rest of the pizza was quite salty.  I didn't see much sauce, nor taste the sweetness of the pineapple.  Regular cheese pizza: same as above.  The overriding flavor was salt mixed with canola (or some other vegetable oil).   The good thing is, their management was very helpful, and their servers (we had two, for some reason) were spot on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=100,2.4,2.84,2.756,2.1239999999999997,2.664

Over the years, their menu expanded, and added things like sandwiches and even fish n chips.  I was craving fish n chips, and stopped by the Orange location, at the Outlets of Orange. Our server was bubbly, and started off with drinks. I didn't come for the famous pizzas because wanted the fish n chips, and I also knew we had to end our meal with a pizookie, a dessert that is a combination of a pizza and cookie (hence, pizookie) The fish n chips were nice, hot and fresh, and their skinny fries (the width of a match stick) was so addicting.  Some people may like ""regular"" fries like McDonalds or the thicker fries you would get in a traditional fish n chips, but I really liked the skinny fries. After dinner, Karen and I decided to share the mini trio pizookie: 2 signature chocolate chips for each of us, and a monkey bread pizookie to share.  The chocolate chip is their original pizookie, and it wasn't until recently they added the monkey bread, which is a cinnamon bread (think cinnabun) without the icing.

We were finally seated at 8:20 and waited for our server to take our drinks. (10-15mins for him to take our drink orders). I kindly asked for water with lemon & an iced vanilla coffee. Our drinks came 15mins later and forgot my water with lemon. No biggie, so I kindly asked again for my water with lemon and he apologized. 15 mins later my water comes, no lemon. I kindly ask him again for a lemon while he took my food order. He apologized again and said he would be back with the lemon. For reference I ordered A bowl (not bread bowl) of Clam Chowder and fish and chips and my husband ordered a medium rare hamburger. 2 servers from the kitchen I believe come and hand out everyone's soup or salads but the order was semi mixed up. My friend had ordered a bowl of clam chowder as well as I but the servers had a bread bowl clam chowder and a bowl of clam chowder. My friend and I told them we both ordered a bowl not a bread bowl. They offered the bread bowl to either of us no up charge so my friend took it since I didn't want bread. Mix up not so bad, it happens. As I lift the spoon off my bowl I see black and brown crusty stuff on it. GROSS. I flag the waiter and he doesn't see me. I try calling for him but no luck with all the noise going on a saturday night. Waiter disappears so I patiently wait while everyone enjoys their soup or salad. 15mins pass and our waiter finally shows up and I finally get his attention. I ask him for another spoon and show him the crud on mine and he apologizes and says he would get me another one. Again I sit and wait and still no waiter. 15 mins pass and my friend flags down another waiter/server and says ""Excuse me, i'm sorry I know your not our waiter but my friend has been waiting for a spoon because the one that came with her soup had stuff on it and our waiter hasn't came back yet. All our friends are already done with their soups and salad.""  The waiter/server looks at me and says he will get me a new spoon. Before he leaves I kindly ask him ""Also, is there any way I can get my soup warmed up? Its been sitting here and has cooled down."" He looks at me annoyed and rudely says ( I SWEAR ON MY CHILDREN!) ""Sure I can warm it for you, actually do you want it like really really hot? I can make it really hot for you! Actually I'll just get you a new bowl and i'll make sure it's really hot for you! Do you want it really hot?"" I looked at him like wait, what? Was he trying to be funny or plain rude? I laugh a little and tell him ""Well no I dont want it really hot I just wanted it warmed up because it cooled down while waiting for a spoon."" He says ok and leaves. 10 minutes later he comes back with my bowl and says to me in a smart ass tone ""Here you go, is that hot enough for you? If not i'll take it back and make it super hot for you if you want. Try it and let me know if it's hot enough for you I mean thats what you want."" By this time I was fed up and just told him ""No its fine thanks."" I LITERALLY look at my husband and said ""I hope to GOD my entree doesn't come out because I barely get my soup to eat!"" 2 spoons later of soup guess what arrives...my ENTREE. I was irritated at this point. My husband tells me we will just pack up the soup to take home so I can eat my entree. Next thing you know my friend next to me flags down our waiter and asked if his meal came with 2 sides. Waiter says yes it does, my friend says he only has 1 side on plate and that the mashed potatoes were missing. The waiter apologized and went to get him his missing mashed potato. I slice into my fish & chips and guess what, the batter was soft and soggy, and the fish was wet and bland. I literally shook so much pepper and salt on it and STILL it was bland. No taste at all. 1 bite was all it took. I ate a few of the fries that were fine and pushed my meal aside. I had lost my appetite. My husband offered to share his burger with me since it was cut in half and I said no thanks. He took his first bite of the burger and was disappointed. The patty was well done, over cooked, AND dry. He was so hungry since his last meal was breakfast and he works on the weekends and barely has time for lunch breaks, that he ate half the burger then shoved the rest. He told me he didn't enjoy it at all but that he was so hungry he had to bare it. By this time we were all highly disappointed in the service and our meal. Our bday friend was the one whose side was missing from his meal. We joked about how come the first half of our table had great service and great food but the rest of us at the end of the table including the bday boy had bad service and bad food. My friend didn't even want to wait for his bday pizookie because he was just over the whole situation. We made him stay and said at least we know the pizookie has to be good!

The server, Michelle, seemed very friendly at first.... But no. She took a while to get us our drinks and appetizers. Overall, she was just very inattentive with our party. And it was noticeable since she would only keep checking up on the tables right next to us. Long story short, it took more than 40 min to get our burgers... 40 min! At first we were very patient. I get it, it's a Saturday night, it's prolly not her fault. I called a manager over and told him our situation. By then we barely got out food. Michelle asked if we needed anything else, and we said ranch and BBQ sauce please. The guy I called over called the general manager I guess, Ryan. He was very concerned and helpful. They even offered free dessert. Let's forward... 20 min pass and we still haven't gotten our ranch. Now the server is avoiding us. She might have gotten mad for us complaining, but if I'm going to BJs and paying for great food and service, i expect that and nothing less. She finally gets us our ranch and THROWS AND SLAMS THE PLATE FULL OF RANCH AND SAUCE ON THE TABLE. I AM DEFINITELY NOT OKAY WITH FOOD THROWN ON MY TABLE. Still, we thanked her and she didn't even turn to look at  us. That's when i stood up and personally had to find Ryan. I explained the situation.

I asked for a change in server and I do appreciate Ryan taking care of the situation and personally bringing us the check. Side note: we didn't get dessert.

I couldn't even go home without stopping to tell you that you should go eat somewhere else.  I'm in my car writing this because maybe tonight someone thought of coming here but will read this review and I'll have saved that person from spending hard earned  money at this place.  Reasons why you don't come here: 1.  The hostess took our party of 2 to a table after asking for a booth. She said 'wait here and you can move there when he's done bussing.' Then took off.  Probably could have waited until it was clear to seat us instead of making us watch the busser waiting for the head nod to come sit.  2.  15 min wait for water.   3. Ordered the avocado egg rolls-another 15 min.  When it did come,  no sauce.  Asked the waitress about the sauce and she said they ran out of sauce cups so they just didn't put it on the plate.  Amazing.  15 min wait for sauce.  4.  25 min wait for 1 pizza and 1 salad.  Salad dressing was gross and the only good thing on the plate was the chicken.  Couldn't finish it.  Pizza looked weird and was dry.  Def not the quality I'm used to at BJs 5.  Ran out of water 4 times.   6. Asked for a box for pizza and salad and waited  for awhile for just a pizza box...none for salad.  7. Pizookie took another 15min and was lukewarm 8. Check came and took 15 more minutes to run it.  Our server wasn't even the one who came to collect the credit card. We could have walked out and not paid if we wanted to but we're better than that.   9. We didn't even see our server serving other tables.  What was she doing? The restaurant was moderately busy but there were three servers in our section.  One group of 20 right next to us.  They got great service! 20 people!!! (Different server) We were 2! They got shots,  refills, boxes, and the servers had time to sing happy birthday to these people.  Our server wasn't in the chorus so wtf!?  Where was this girl? Did I make her up like fight Club? Was I giving myself bad service?? Am I Bruce Willis in the sixth sense?  10. This is unrelated to the restaurant and they had no control over this but:  there was some massive car meet tonight at the block which completely clogged all roads in the parking lot in addition to city drive all the way to the 5 fwy. Racey McVapefaces were  revving their engines and cutting people off and blocking all intersections making it very difficult to even get to BJs to get the worst service of my life.   Not sure how often this car thing happens at the block but consider it a sign from the sweet baby Jesus himself that you shouldn't come eat here.   Total we spent about 2 hours to dine here.  Think of all the things you can do in two hours.   Do those things instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=40,2.2,2.75,2.724,2.052,2.5300000000000002

Worst service of the year award goes to BJ's at the Block of Orange (or whatever it's called now)! Unless you're a party of 12, expect long waits that get longer with each interaction with the waitress! My sister suggested we meet up here to discuss her birthday plans and have dinner and also because it was free pizookie Tuesday. I hadn't visited a BJ's in a long while so I was looking forward to trying a pizza again. After we ate here I remembered why I stopped going to BJ's all together; it lost its luster and is pretty much equivalent to dining at Dave and Buster's in the opposite corner of the mall.     We started with avocado egg rolls and they looked fresh out of the frozen foods section and disheveled. I asked our waitress if it came with dipping sauce and she replied, ""Oh yeah it does. The must be out of ramekins back there. Sorry about that."" My sister said, ""We'll take it in a bowl or on a plate or if they want to bring the sauce out here and drizzle it on the egg rolls, that's fine too."" Off our waitress went into the abyss, never to be seen again. We waited for a while then started eating the egg rolls without the sauce but it was inedible without it. Too tangy and not appetizing at all. Finally, alas she returned with a ramekin halfway filled with some brown stuff that was the sauce.      We ordered a medium sweet pig pizza and a wedge salad. We waited and waited....waited, FINALLY! The  waitress brought the pizza over, placed it on the designated pizza holder and asked if we needed anything else. We said we were good and she looked away and walked off. In the past, I remembered the pizza was piping hot and the waitress would always use the pizza spatula and place a slice of pizza on a plate and give everyone at the table their first slice. Not anymore. So the pizza isn't much of a deep dish anymore. The dough/crust used to taste fried with a nice crispy cheese layer around it. Now it's a baked crust but the pizza itself is pretty flat. Looks like it came out of the freezer and into the oven. The wedge salad wasn't appetizing either.    Fifteen minutes go by and we put our order in for a 1/2 chocolate chip, 1/2 salted caramel pizookie. Fifteen minutes later our pizzokie comes out but it's not even good! Everything here lost its luster. The check took eons to get to us and then she disappeared even longer! Where did she go?

I had an unfortunate incident occur when my 3 year old son got stuck in one of the high chairs, where one of his legs was pinned up against the front guard. Not only was the staff helpful in trying to fix the situation, but also helped in keeping my little guy calm and happy as they rushed to get the proper tools needed to disassemble the high chair. Unfortunately, they did not have the correct tool, at which point I remembered I had tools in my trunk.

After Seeing email promo ad and calling this one to make sure THAT GAME was showing (w/sound) , I went this location to see the USMNT-Copa America game. They ended up just having the NBA final game of course, though they put on the US game on the side television - the main TV as well as the sound were just for the NBA finals. Now of course, I GET IT-I GET IT;The finals will always get priority.....BUT, If you guys hadn't advertised it, and if they had specifically told me over the phone otherwise, I would not of had a problem with it-I WOULD NOT HAVE CAME!!! The manager I talk to seem pretty indifferent about it; and just simply maintained there was nothing he could do - after I explained the whole entire scenario to him. He simply said once the sound of the NBA game was on, he was basically powerless to change it. From what me and my friends could see, nobody there was really paying any kind of attention to the games. There were also a handful of other people there with USA soccer jerseys on, so in my opinion making the change of channels would've been completely harmless. So honestly, I found his explanation completely bogus. And naturally, we checked out and left elsewhere. Although he didn't charge us for the wings we ordered, we still paid for the couple beers we had. As I mentioned before, it was just the complete inconvenience and the total lack of regard from him-when I brought it up, as server had even reassured us WHEN WE arrived they would simply put on sound and the game on Main TVs, before we started ordering.

It sat on the table for 15 minutes getting cold before any server came by. The utensils showed up a few minutes later, and I sent the cold appetizers back. The meal showed up, which was a salmon dish over Cous Cous and asparagus. The asparagus was NOT trimmed, so I had to fight with the woody stems with every bite. The Cous Cous was over cooked and the bottom of the dish was under water, as if the salmon was served over wet, undrained pasta. After my meal was finished, the appetizer showed up again for dessert. There was no offer to comp that item, and again, at least one of us at the table had no utensils to eat the appetizer with since he had ordered a sandwich and no utensils were ever delivered for his meal.

Once we ordered it took a long time just to get our drinks. We ordered our food at the same time we ordered drinks and asked for our bill, so we could make sure to get out on time. We didn't get our food until about 45 minutes later and two of us didn't even get our food then. We still hadn't got our bill at this point either despite asking for it multiple times. Finally one more meal came with just enough time to eat the main part quickly and grab a handful of fries to eat on the way out. The other meal never came, so one co-worker didn't get lunch. They took it off the bill, of course, but she had to go back to work hungry. We finally got our bill and rushed out. We didn't even get to sing happy birthday or get a birthday pazookie, which I asked for in the very beginning when we ordered drinks and food. It was a stressful bad experience.

150,Andre G.,"Orange, CA",77,81,60.0,3.0,2016-08-30,"I was looking at all of the ratings for BJ's here and was thinking, why does it have so few stars? I come here fairly often and always have a good time. However, after my last visit, I saw why. Everything was great, except waiting for the check. As I said before, we visit often, so we know the menu well, and knew what we wanted and ordered right away. No trouble there, we even were offered happy hour prices even though we got there about 15 minutes after happy hour. Nice! The food was cooked perfectly, drinks tasted great, and the overall ambiance was enjoyable. But the waiting for the check part was really a bummer. We asked for our check right when our original waiter was going on break, so we had to wait extra long for the new waitress to process all of the tables and get things going. Now I'm okay with waiting a bit and getting an explanation from the waitress, but as I said, we ordered at around 7:15, finished our food at around 8, and left the restaurant at 8:30. 30 minutes to process and close out a check is way too long for me, I'm sorry. It was almost the length of time we spent eating there! And no apology or even a canned response as to why we waited a long time. My girlfriend had to go up to the waitress when she was at the cash register to give her our cards because we grew tired of waiting.  So overall, I love BJ's Restaurants.

They let us the know the wait time is about 40 minutes. That's not an issue, we figure it's 8:30, let's just kill some time and go to do some shopping. We come back to find that our name has already been called but that's not a problem because we are quickly seated anyways. We are seated and greeted by a guy by the name of Patrick. It was very easy to connect with him, sociable guy and made us have a couple good laughs in between ordering our food. Well things started going south quickly. The wait time to order food and get our food was a little long. When we finally got our food, there wasn't any ketchup or Parmesan cheese. So here we are trying to flag down anyone to get us these things and refills. Patrick is no where to be seen so a guy by the name of James attends to our needs. Throughout the entire dinner we're constantly having to flag down people (anyone other than Patrick) We were very understanding, we get it, it's busy. It took 40+ minutes to order a pizookie. I finally had enough and talked to management to see if we could get an extra pizookie given the time frame and how inattentive our server was. Michelle was very great!!! & agreed without hesitation, bringing out 2 pizookies fairly shortly after. Patrick walks by and makes a remark about me talking to management. Then as we're in the middle of finishing up our dessert, Patrick brings out yet another pizookie!! He mutters something and shoves it on the table. We're left stunned because we didn't ask for a third pizookie and we don't even know what he said. We ended up giving it away to the party right next to us. Jokes on Patrick if he tried anything funny! We pay our tab, and let James know we appreciate him taking the time to attend us when we really weren't his intended party to serve. Right as we're leaving, James happens to be at the door and we again say thank you & goodnight. Well Patrick walks by and screams (literally) ""have a good night!!!!!!!!"" Everyone's face was stunned and of course we're left dumbfounded. I end up calling the restaurant and explained to management what happened. Michelle again took care of me and promised to take care of the issue. She even offered to send me a gift card via email. Michelle and James, you rock!

Some of the appetizers are great like the wings and the calamari, but I would say the rest of the food is not that great.

The pasta was undercooked and asparagus was overlooked. It had no seasoning what so ever. My friend got the steak with Brussels sprouts. He asked for medium rare and it was over cooked to medium well. The Brussels sprouts were so overlooked that it was mushy. It was also underseasoned.

Ordedered the House Sirloin with Baked Potato and Cesar Salad, and a Handcrafted Rootbeer. The rootbeer was great. Not too thick and strong. The salad was just as good, actually a bit bigger than I was expecting which was a nice surprise.  For this, I gave an extra star in my rating. The steak and potato... I know BJ's specializes in pizza, but that is no reason to not care about the other menu options.  I ordered the steak Medium, which would typically result in a moist juicy steak.  The steak I received was nothing like that.  It honestly had the appearance of freezer burn.  It was dried out from end to end.  Once cut, which wasn't an easy task, you could actually see a third of it with zero pink, while the remaining was all pink.  Even with the pink, the steak was rough and not pleasing.  I left a little less than half on the plate. The potato was a bit undercooked.  It had its rough spots. I was hoping the included butter would soften it up, but it didn't. The plate this was served on was absolutely too small.  I realize it was a steak and potato, but there was hardly any room to cut my leather, I mean steak.  With each cut, the potato would nearly slide off the plate.

(from past experiences).  Seems like they've changed their menu a bit as well.  I've never seen Brussells sprouts before and it seems to be the new fad.  I was leary about trying them because, well, it's an item I haven't seen before and I've had amazing brussells sprouts elsewhere. So I decided to give them a try, since they were a fairly good price. Surprisingly, they were really good. The Brussels sprouts were a creamy and crunchy and toasty, like the were sauteed in butter, there was fresh grated, melted cheese over top and it was plentiful.  ( BJ'S do not change this recipe!)  My wife had the DOS Tacos Plato's. Well that's what I'm calling it, because there were two tacos on a plate and I don't remember the real name of the dish.  I think they should change it to my name instead. Haha. Anyways I digress.

Anyways, my group ordered a large pizza: half The Great White and the other half pepperoni, the brussel sprouts, and wings.  Not eating any meat I passed on the wings and dove into those brussel sprouts.   I had a slice of The Great White pizza, which is chicken alfredo on a pizza.  I picked off the chicken and it was far too rich for me.  The crust at BJ's is incredibly buttery (greasy?) and I don't really like the taste of it.  Is it supposed to be deep dish? I think so but it never sits well with me.  I only half enjoyed it when I added red pepper flakes to it.   Brussel sprouts were really good.  Fried to a crisp then topped with a honey sriracha sauce? Yes please! These are a solid crowd pleaser.  Avocado egg rolls are always a delight.  They are exactly as they sound plus a spicy cream sauce inside and topped with cilantro and coupled with a sweet/salty dipping sauce.   Of course we ended with the classic chocolate chip Pizookie. Warm cookie plus ice cream equals the perfect ending to an ok dinner.   This is a good place for a group.

43,Jessica L.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",624,277,732.0,2.0,2017-02-22,"It really surprises me of all the bad experiences that I have had at BJs since I have moved to SoCal. You can't really go to any major shopping area or any food area without running into one. You would think this means they have their shit together.. Oi how wrong I was. I honestly only ate here because I got a coupon from the Yelp Elite event. And I still don't think it was worth it.  We came here at the tail end of brunch on a Sunday morning, about 5 minutes until it was over to be exact. We were quickly seated and the hostess was nice enough to allow for us to order off of the brunch and as well as the lunch/dinner menu. Unfortunately that is where the meal fell flat. We waited around for quite sometime before our actual waiter came over, by that time we had all decided on what we wanted to eat but for some reason he would only take our drink orders. Fine, whatever its fine.  Time droned on and then he finally came over to take our order. My sister and I ordered off the lunch menu and husband ordered from their brunch menu. With the restaurant being about 50% empty, we didn't expect for there to be such a delay in getting our food - boy were we wrong. And what made it worse is that while we were waiting our waiter didn't even bother to check on us, our cups were left unfilled as we waited. What bothered me most was the he didn't even seem to acknowledge our existence, he would casually stroll by and not make any contact  - not even a ""your food will be right with you."" When our food finally did arrive, of course most of it was wrong. My sister, who driven by her weird cravings only wanted mashed potatoes and french fries - had ordered a side of barbecue sauce when she originally ordered was missing. My husbands simple sunny side up eggs, ham and sourdough toast was completely wrong. The eggs were over hard and the toast was white.. he was content to just suck it up and eat the meal and was midway through chewing on a piece of toast (it came with 4 pieces) but miraculously our waiter decided to come check on us. We informed him of the error and without an apology he simply dismissed it saying ""oh, they must have grabbed the wrong plate."" He grabbed the plate and again the waiting commenced. Again, many times throughout our wait we saw him walk by, never once did he apologize for the delay or even acknowledge us. He came back about 10 minutes later with the exact same plate - I know this because the 3 pieces of white toast were still sitting there with the now cold ham and finally sunny side up eggs. Again no apology was given. He just set down the food and walked away.  The only redeeming thing about my experience here was my chicken soba noodles, they were delicious. The noodles were soft and delicious, chicken and vegetables were plentiful and sauce was just right.  Toward the end of the meal, I was just over it - I wanted to get out of there I was so annoyed. I presented him with my coupon and my credit card and wanted to get things done. He took the coupon and said that he couldn't run the card just yet.. Ugh.. sure? He came back with a receipt but of course it wasn't itemized so there was just no way for me to know if he actually honored my Yelp coupon.. Not wanting to waste anymore time here I ran my card and left.  Not exactly sure what is going on with BJs, their service is just horrendous - even if your food was delicious the service itself leaves a nasty taste in your mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=40,2.76,2.72,2.772,2.2800000000000002,2.736

39,Alexa R.,"Orange, CA",341,27,6.0,1.0,2017-02-28,"Honestly, I used to love Bjs because of the atmosphere, food, and service. But this location has to be the worst one open, which is sad because this is down the street from my house. My family drove 2 hours to eat at a fun place and we decided on this location because of proximity to where I live, but unfortunately this experience made my aunt's birthday not the best one. Instead of naming every detail, I rather just list them so you can just get the idea how  unpleasant our experience was. We were a party of 8, you would think they would pay more attention to how they serve a medium sized party.  1. Our drinks were always watered down with ice because our server had to be reminded 2-3 times about refills 2. Our server failed to mention that you ""cannot take out the jalepenos"" on a specific burger, and my brother didn't receive a new order burger until everyone had completed their meals. They tried to ""customize him a burger"" to fit his needs and attempted to be nice BUT ended up charging us double the price as the original burger he had ordered 3. I told the server it was my aunt's birthday and asked her to bring people/candle to sing-- she forgot and just brought out the pizookie, then went BACK to go look for a candle, then left without any regards to what I asked 4. They billed us wrong and duplicated orders on the menu 5. (This wasn't to us) But we witnessed the manager move a small family to another table as they were eating to fulfill the needs for a ""bigger party"" Basically, the food is okay. But the servers/service is very unsatisfying. Will not be coming back to this location or recommending it.

203,Lisa H.,"Westminster, CA",57,43,250.0,1.0,2017-03-16,"We come to the Orange location & HB often but have yet to experience such horrible service. As usual, we place our name on the preferred list before come in. As we got there, we got seated a few minute later, which is normal. We like oh yeah, we got here before 7pm it still happy hours but we couldn't order anything off the happy hours menu (drink -appetizer - etc) because our server was no where to be seen! It took them 10 min for another server to come to our table to let us know that our server was back up & will be over shortly & ask to take our drink order. Which is very nice of him to help our server out. It is understandable since I have work in the food industry so I know sometime it get busy. But really, you could come by & say, I will be over shortly. So, after 15 min of being seated, our server finally came over (my gosh, we are only a party of 2). She came over & took our alcohol drink & food order. We both order the daily special (& last night was the burger special for $10 each). Our alcohol drink came (they had craft beer special for the night at $4 - but was upset with the whole experience that we got charge $6.25 for it instead - I know it not much but when it is advertised at $4 for craft beer) After she took our order, I forgot to tell her that I want my burger to be well done. Took us another 6 min to flag her down. Finally, we told her that my burger need to be well done. She say she will go tell the cooks right away. I was so relief that we finally got to flag her down. Finally, our food came out. As usual, whenever I order my burger, I always cut it in half - to check to make sure there no pink. & what the odd??? Pink!!! So, it took us another few minute to flag our server down as usual. She told us that she told the cook -well done. (or so we hope she did) Manager came over & even say oh my it not even close to mediumSo the manager apologize. On top of that, my boyfriend didn't want to eat his food because by time my food come back he be done. So he waited of course his burger is getting cold here. To top all of this, we did not have any utensil or so, no fork or napkins... So here we go again, flagging our server down & guess what? You got it, our server was no where to be found. So my fries came out in the meantime... Yes!!! My food came - the manager drop off my burger & she left. 2nd time around & it was cook perfect. I got to say, the first burger was more presentable than the 2nd burger (the 2nd burger, my hickory brisket was all on the cookie sheet instead of on my burger - no fork - mean I couldn't pick up my brisket ) Finally after another 5 minute we flag her down for some fork and napkins. My gosh did we had an adventure tonight. How could a server be that inexperience or horrible. I mean you mine as well advertised that you serve raw burger then? It was beyond medium. Wow! Top off my burger, my boyfriend burger he could only ate ¾ of his burger. ¼ of his burger was raw - uncook! Wow! Best part, we were both done. Finally!!! But - guess what??? Our server was no where to be found!!! What the odd again??? I tried to pay using the apps with my credit card since we was so furious for all the long wait. But after trying to pay using the app twice it was declined. It not like my card is bad - it just wouldn't allow me to pay. So after many unsuccessful trying to flag our server down - we hate to do this - but we end up asking another server to flag her down for us - We ask another server to send her over to our table. So after about 10 minute of waiting for our check - our server finally came over & ask what we needed - my gosh? Really? Our napkin is on top of our food - can you not see that we are done and want our check so we could be on our way? I wanna cried! We was so frustrated that we did not even bother asking her to fix the craft beer from $6.25 to $4 as advertised. So we just paid cash and tip her $2. She is lucky she got some tip. But honestly, of all the time we went... Not once did our server came by & ask if we wanted to order another drink or get our water refill. Not once did she came back & ask if our food was good or when my 2nd burger came out if it was better. Not once she came over to ask if we wanted refills on our fries. Not once did she just come by without us flagging her down for question/ help!!! Never have we experience such horrible service, long delay, terrible food, took forever to get our check (someone please update the apps version so we could pay via apps). Got off work early - been waiting all week to come in on a Wednesday to enjoy the $10 burger deal with unlimited fries & $4 craft beer.

A manager came out in between that and apologized and said they were having a chef look into it and assured us our meal was going to come out quickly and asked if he could do anything for us and commented before walking away that the fish was cut fresh daily.   My husband is a professional chef in the business for going on 15 yrs now and we eat alot of fresh poke and sushi and it was either just a end of tail shit cut or just a poor quality tuna.

I appreciate the food and relaxed ambiance that generally every BJ's Restaurant has to offer, but ever since this one opened in Orange, I feel that it hasn't been able to get on its feet.  Service has consistently been slow and confused in my experience. My parents wanted to eat here for a family dinner, and it was the general consensus that we should have eaten elsewhere. Most BJ's that I frequent have a more laid back vibe over the sports bar vibe, however this restaurant was so loud that my family and I constantly had to repeat ourselves to the waiter and to one another just to have a conversation. The service left much to be desired as my dad's beer came out before all of our waters, our food came out before the silverware, and my brother's Sierra Mist was accidentally refilled with water. I never had any particular problems with the food at this location, however my mom was quite disappointed that her steak was dry. I ordered the Peruvian Bowl with Salmon which was okay--I was satisfied. Despite the overall negative experience, our order of the Monkey Bread Pizookie saved the night. The only reason this review has two stars is because of that tasty and sweet dessert.

So after the long wait we were seated in a booth near the front of the restaurant. Our waiter's name was Ralph. He was just ok to me. I definitely think he could've been more friendly. We ended up just sharing the appetizer combo. This was pretty good but nothing to brag home about. My only complaint was when he brought my refills over for my strawberry lemonade he left all the empty glasses on the table. That's a big pet peeve of mine. I never understood why servers do that. Like who wants a bunch of dirty glasses all over their table when they are eating right?  So my over all experience was just ok. I really think this place needs to step up their customer service.

They were still figuring things out but I remember having the bar set so high and every other BJ's matched that... Until this one. I've been here three times now and honestly if it weren't for the food I'd just stop coming altogether, and for how late it's open. This last time we got seated, it took almost 10 minutes for someone to realize we hadn't been helped and it wasn't even our server. Then my drink came out, but not my friend's and there were no waters which we had ordered. Then our actual server comes out with the wrong drink for me but has the rest of the drinks, our two glasses of water and my friend's drink. Awesome, now we just wait for the food. Couple minutes pass and our food gets here and is correct and great-tasting. My friend didn't say much about the pizza other than it was good. But as for me with the Parmesan crusted chicken, it felt there was no flavor to it, as well as the cheddar mashed potatoes. Not that it was dry, just lackluster. I still ate it because I was hungry and wasn't going to order something else and wait longer, but just wish I had more of a better taste in my mouth than a full stomach of no taste. Consistently though, the service hasn't been the greatest with waiting for more than a couple minutes for a waiter to take our drinks. As well as our regular order. The food and drinks come out at a reasonable time, but given the wait time just to get a server is pretty bad.

This made my companion extremely happy since he had been talking about it all day (open face chili burger). Brian was quick and efficient while making us feel like a priority.  The food was excellent. I used this as a last supper so to speak before going in to surgery and they did not dissapoint! Great food and amazing beer selection.

We were seated very quickly and our server did not speak to us or look at us for FIFTEEN minutes. My fiancé and I sat there wondering if we should just get up and leave or get up and find the manager. The waitress finally came over to us and didn't apologize for the wait and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered our drinks, apps, and entrees all at once, fearing she would never return! We tried to order ribs and they were all out- so weird! She asked us if we wanted our apps to come out before our entrees and we agreed. Literally two minutes later, she brings out my fiancé's Irish mule and my house salad, which had the tiniest amount of dressing. We sat there waiting for my drink to arrive and my fiancé's Caesar salad. A few minutes later I received my drink but still no sign of the salad! Our appetizers arrived and the artichoke was good but our flatbread was soggy and undercooked! Still no sign of the Caesar salad! The waitress walks over and asks if everything is alright and I told her the salad had not arrived and she admitted she never put the order in!! My drink was empty and she did not offer to get me a refill, I had to ask her to please get me more iced tea! She did not ask my fiancé if he wanted another cocktail, which could have increased the check total and her overall tip. Our entrees arrived right after that and my pizza was doughy and messy. The waitress came back over and asked if we got the salad yet, and since we did not we just cancelled it because our meal was already at the table. The food was alright, definitely not the best we have at at BJ's. As we expected, our waitress took forever to get our check and to run our card.

The waiter then asked her if she was sure and if she had had a cocktail from Bjs before. She knows her Patron, trust me. It would've been nice if he didn't actually question what she tasted.  The quinoa side was really dry, and very unappetizing. The peanut soba noodles were extremely saucy and salty.  Ordered a clam chowder and didn't get any oyster crackers to help cut the saltiness of the chowder.  Ah well. I sound like an old grumbling pessimist, but it really wasn't that great.

As we were waiting for the table to get bused the server dropped a knife on my foot, which wasn't the best feeling in the world. Yeah I know you are probably thinking that I shouldn't have been so close to the table, well I wasn't, he was rapidly wiping down the table and didn't notice the knife, so it flew a couple feet over to where we were standing.  We get sat and they bring our drinks out. We order our food, and food was meh. I am totally okay with going to places if service is whatever as long as food is great.

It was originally $40 but there was a 50% off wine deal making it $20, so that didn't hurt so bad.

Yup, you guessed it - she put me on hold again for another 4 minutes to ask someone who I should contact. I understand completely that it's not BJ's fault whether or not a dasher comes to pick up an order, but I am very disappointed in the way they chose to handle the situation.

We arrived there around 9ish, and the hostess asked us if we wanted to be seated inside, outside or either, we chose inside.. she also explained to us that there would be a 30 min wait, ok no big deal. It was actually less than 30 so not bad, we were taken to our table-which was OUTSIDE... I guess there was no communication on that part. We asked politely to be seated inside they did accommodate and I appreciated it. Now we've been looking at the menu while we were waiting so we know what we wanted and ordered right away. Our waiter, Brennen was great he was on point about everything, one of those two stars belong to him. Now I ordered my favorite dish Cherry Glazed Chipotle Salmon and my husband ordered the Sirloin Steak. The steak my husband had was amazing!! The second star goes to the steak. My salmon on the other hand was Horrible. When I received my salmon everything appeared to be amazing until I lifted the bottom of it and it was super charred, burnt. I took a bite into it anyway just to see if maybe it didn't taste what it looked, yea I was wrong I had to stop eating it. I wasn't going to say anything and chalk up on the bad dinner but my husband asked Brennen to see if I could get a new salmon. Brennen was kind of enough to have the cook fire up a new one. Yea that one sucked too and came out burnt. I just picked around it, ate what I could and gave up on dinner.

This review is for the Curbside service.  Every single time I've come here, they pretty much tell me that they'll come out when they can because they're busy, which is fine but please communicate that so I'm not wondering what happened or if you forgot about us outside. If you offer Curbside, but can't handle the volume on a busy night, maybe you should stop offering it.  Just a suggestion.  I'm still sitting in my car as I write this review. I called and they said they will be out soon... about 15 mins later, I walked inside and no one was at the register, so I left again. Now I'm still waiting 30 mins later and still no service.   UPDATE - they finally came out 35 mins later and I closed my Yelp app and drove home.  This was on Sunday.   The time before this latest experience, the person who picked up the phone for Curbside actually said that they were no longer coming out and I could come inside to pick up my food if I wanted to (thanks, I guess).  It was about 8pm and the Curbside cut off is 9pm. I walked inside to get my order and there were 3 servers standing around at the register chit chatting. So they weren't busy, they were just lazy.  Not only were they lazy, my food order was wrong and things were missing from my bag... which I noticed when I got home.  The labels that they read to me had the correct food items on them, so I thought the food inside the container was correct.  It wasn't.  So disappointing.  The BJ's on Beach and Edinger might be super busy and further away from my home, but the service and communication have always been good, so next time I'll definitely make the drive out there before I come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=40,2.64,2.95,2.752,2.184,2.8260000000000005

However, they forgot to set the utensils in the first place. But overall the service wasn't too bad The food - let's start off with the clam chowder; the soup was warm ( maybe that's how it is or maybe it was on the pass for too long), which I don't mind, but my sister had a different opinion. The clam had a smell and it wasn't creamy.   The second dish was the prime rib; it was 15 oz (its huuuge). I didn't like the horseradish dip much. In the end my sister had to ask for the a1 sauce.

83,Katelynn M.,"Orange, CA",291,72,208.0,3.0,2017-11-27,"Good, bad, but mostly inconsistent. I have come to this location about 4 times now and each was very different than the others. I sat at the bar twice and in the dining area twice. Both bar area experiences were great, but when I was put in the dining area, the service was much slower. At one visit, we waited an hour to get our food and 30 minutes for our beer to come out. We were not checked on, and it seems like they forgot about us for a while.  Glad they changed their menu because they now have some great new items that I am excited to try!  I ordered the pork chop off the specials menu and wow! It was delicious! This made me believe that BJs can do more than just make bomb pizza.   The monkey bread pizookie is arguable the best dessert they have. I order this 3 times at this location and twice it tasted like a freshly cooked sticky bun without the icing. The third time I had it, it was dry and almost stale. I used the ice cream to soften it to eat it and I didn't complain because I was too shy to do so. This is one example of why I say they are inconsistent.  The only thing that is consistent is the wait staff. They have some great servers who are kind and pretty funny! One in particular was a gentleman who helped us in the bar section on a Monday night. He was very attentive to our group and he had an awesome cherry blossom arm tattoo. His jokes made our night! Never got his name, but kudos to you sir!

The mozzarella sticks were good, but unfortunately I could not say as much for the chicken sandwich. It wasn't horrible, but it's the same here as with a lot of chain restaurants -- they add so much stuff (ham, on top of bacon, on top of sauce) that you aren't sure what you are eating -- and then when you pick it apart you realize there's so much stuff because none of it has any real flavor.  And then I felt that gross kind of too full, sick, greasy feeling the rest of the night.  That my daughter, who had the veggie burger, felt the same way, and my other daughter who had the sliders only ended up eating one of them -- I'm thinking it's more universal than just me.   The service was okay.  Our waiter, was super nice, but also super busy with a lot of other large tables.  So, I don't blame him on being slow -- I blame management, hire some more servers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2,3.12,2.99,2.808,,3.0420000000000007
97,Ronny T.,"Garden Grove, CA",249,76,61.0,4.0,2017-11-29,"First off, BJ's is so littt. They have a variety of food from burgers to steak to vegetarian stuff. It's suitable for anyone to come by and enjoy a great meal. Since this location in particular is near the outlets of orange, it is generally crowded. Especially on weekends, expect a wait time before being seated. The time varies, but you're going to have to wait hence ""wait time"".   Inside the restaurant, the ambience is pretty mellow, not too obnoxiously loud and not too quiet. Everyone is just having a good time enjoying their meals. For me, the wait time was around 30 min before we got seated. I ordered the house top sirloin with no vegetables cause all you need is carbs and protein right? Just kidding I'm not a big fan of greens that's why. What was surprising to me was that on the menu it stated that it's only 500 calories. Lowkey when I saw that I thought I was tripping because all that for 500 calories is pretty spectacular. I had doubts but didn't want to think about it so I wouldn't feel guilty and stuff. I asked the waiter if I can get my meat rare cause rare is the way to go for meat. Don't sleep on rare. Fortunately, BJ's do have the rare option so that's clutchhh. Anyways it costs around 18 bucks but it's healthy so I can't complain. Since the restaurant was crowded, it took a while but the food is so great you can smell it before it got to your table . I took a bite out of the sirloin and that meat is straight fire I kid you not. The meat is really pink but like you know it's safe and stuff which makes the food even better ! The meat has a perfect mixture of dryness and fat, which satisfies your craving instantly. Each bite you can just taste how fresh the meat and how well it was made. The meal comes with rice and mashed potatoes which taste amazing as well, especially the mashed potatoes. Rice tastes like rice so hard to describe it . Overall, BJ's is a place that has  delicious food that is fit for everyone. It doesn't matter if you're vegetarian, the one term for people who only eats fish, vegan, bulking, cutting, etc... come through BJ's for some amazing food and a great time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2,3.24,2.99,2.82,,3.0900000000000007

82,Julianne M.,"CA, CA",154,12,4.0,1.0,2017-12-04,"This review is solely on a server's service. My husband and I met here on our first date and as tradition, we visit this restaurant every year on the day and time of our first date.  We had made reservations but had to wait 15 additional minutes as they didn't have seating available as it was a slightly busy night. We were seated in the outdoor area where there weren't many others as it was a chilly night, our server is a young male, in his late 20's to early 30's, shaved head with horned rim glasses. You could say that this dude was your typical hipster looking server. He asked us what we would like to drink and I requested a Sierra Mist with mint leaves. About 15 minutes later, we get our drinks and my drink has 2 small leaves which looked more like lettuce pieces. I called our server back and asked if I could get a few more mint leaves and he then goes to tell me that he would need to charge $1 for mint leaves because it's not standard to the drink. Okay? I dropped the issue and asked if I could just get a different drink as I didn't want to get into an argument over mint. We ordered our food and I ordered their prime rib special.  It took both my husband and my food about an additional 45, 50 minutes to get to our table but it's not a big deal. We weren't ""that"" hungry and we were celebrating our anniversary. Now, by the time we did get our meals, our drinks are empty and need a refill and our server took our cups and disappeared. Slightly uncomfortable to eat without our drinks but we weren't going to complain. We flagged down a busser and asked for our drinks and he came out a minutes later with our drinks. About 10 minutes later, our server comes to our table and is like ""I got you your drinks! Oh someone already brought them?!"" Seriously? At this point, I am starting to get bugged out by the server but I don't want to ruin the night. My Prime Rib meal comes with a Pizookie and I had to flag down a few hostesses to grab my server. Finally was able to tell him that we wanted our dessert, he brings out the mini size Pizookie and our bill. We were pretty full so a mini size was fine but my meal comes with a full size Pizookie, not the mini. As we are eating our dessert, I begin to discuss business with my husband about upcoming filming schedules and production editing when our server who has been nearly absent our entire meal butts into our conversation and asks ""Sorry to interrupt but are you in the film industry? I work in the film industry too! I'm a camera man... etc."" Up until this point this guy has been rude, can't get our orders right, slow service and he's been snooping around listening to our conversation? He overstayed his welcome at our table to tell us about the ""experience"" he has, how he only likes working indie smaller crews, and how serving isn't his ""real passion"" and that it's important for us to network? Kid, get out of my face. It was the most uncomfortable dinner we have had in a very long time. He asked if we could exchange information and we politely declined as we are not interested in working with someone that only lights up to be helpful when its beneficial to them. We took a look at our bill and he even charged us for a full size Pizookie when it should have been included in my meal AND our server gave us a mini size one. We asked another server and she fixed the bill right away. I almost left without tipping due to how arrogant the server was and how uncomfortable we felt at the end of our meal. BJ's, if you're reading this, please tell that server to mind his own business!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2,3.24,2.98,2.836,,3.0840000000000005

We always get the same thing when we go just because we can never get enough: boneless wings as an appetizer, half buffalo half BBQ. A mini great white pizza. Two, maybe four beers. Depends who's driving. We normally go to the HB location on beach Blvd, but we decided to stop by here after a movie a couple nights ago on a Sunday. We walk in and there's only 1 other couple waiting and we ask for a table for 2. The hostess tells us it'll be about 10 minutes. No problem. She takes our name down, or at least acts like she does. Around 15 minutes after sitting there we haven't been seated. We choose to be patient, I've been a hostess before and I know 10 minutes isn't always exactly 10 minutes. After having waited like 25 minutes another male host asks us ""are you guys waiting for a table?"" And we say yes. He asks for the name and he can't seem to find it on their list and when he asks the other hosts she just shrugs her shoulders and walks away. He then immediately seats us at at table closest to the host stand. Keep in mind that all the that tables around where were seated are empty. There's only a party of 3 next to us. The server then comes over and takes down our drink order. We order waters since we haven't decided on which beer to have. It takes her about 15 minutes to come back with the waters. By this time we're ready to order drinks and food. We always know what we want. Like I've stated earlier, we always get the same things. When our wings arrive, they hardy have any sauce on them and they're cold. They've definitely been sitting on that window for a good 10-15 min. We send them back. We don't mind them being microwaved, we just don't want cold wings. Our pizza then arrives and we're sitting on the table without sauce and with out extra plates. Our server doesn't stop by for about 10 minutes after our pizza has arrived, we've been waiting to order ranch off her and extra plates. We finally get the plates and ranch and we eat the pizza. Our wings arrive afterwards. Much better temperature and all. We then sit there, and sit and the waiter doesn't stop by at all. We then flag her down and we ask for the bill. I watch her walk over to a computer, print out something and then stare out into the distance and walk into the back of the restaurant. 10 minutes later our check finally arrives. She tells us ""thanks for waiting, I got you guys some sweet discounts for the wings coming out bad."" We look at the bill and the only discounts are for my beer and the pizza, which naturally are already discounted for us dining during happy hour. Like do you think were dumb? Lol  The hostess service was bad and the server was just plain slow. Probably not coming back to this location. The HB location is always amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=60,3.76,3.07,2.888,,3.346

Had the clam chowder soup which tasted exactly like Campbell's clam chowder!!! I ordered sausage & peppironi pizza (paid extra for the second topping) & they generously gave me lots of sausage to makeup for the pepperonis (well worth the extra $1.25)!!! When my cookie's cream mini pizookie came out there was a hair in it, so they remade it & didn't charge me for it!!! The waitress was really good!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2,3.68,3.07,2.892,,3.314

Just when I thought wow at least the manager is doing his job right! I guess not... and for that we will not go back!!

The wait time to be seated was like 15-20 min, which was fine considering they were busy, so totally understandable. We finally got seated and our waiter Alex Vargas took care of us immediately. He was very attentive, kept checking on us, and was very informative about the menu! I think it was great how well Alex's service was even though it was a really busy night at the restaurant. He deserves some sort of recognition. Great job, keep up the good work, and we will definitely be back.

Our server initially came by about a minute after we sat down and asked if we were ready. When we asked for a few more minutes, it was more than 20min before he showed up again despite being flagged down a few times. It took another half an hour for the food.. which would usually been understandable except the place was pretty empty. The server throughout was dismissive and uninterested. With all the places around the outlets and area, will definitely give this place a pass next time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20,3.68,2.99,2.896,,3.266

Bjs has a fair amount of Vegan offerings found by doing a google search. Tonight I had chips and salsa with a soup/salad combo. Vegan lentil soup (a good lentil as lentils go) with the asparagus and portobello salad (minus the goat cheese). My husband had the Peruvian quinoa bowl that required no alteration to be vegan although he added salmon (he is plant based + fish).  The wait was 25-30 mins but we got called after 18, 5:30 on a Saturday.  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2,3.8,3.04,2.94,,3.3440000000000003
91,Daphne B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,2,,2.0,2018-01-12,"We decided to come for a team dinner recently and the wait was over an hour. Yes, it is completely understandable because BJ's is always busy, especially considering it was a Friday night, although they continued saying that the wait would only be 30 minutes then continued to be 40, then 50, then by the time we know it we have been waiting for an hour and twenty minutes. We kindly asked the employees about our tables, but were ignored and pushed back even further. It was a real disappointment to our team not having the ability to eat at a place we usually enjoy, yet we now have differing opinions about this place now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2,3.68,3.01,2.94,,3.278
88,Lindsey B.,"Orange, CA",50,48,8.0,3.0,2018-01-12,"This place is always super crowded but we usually manage to find a couple of seats in the bar area. Service, drinks, and food have always been great. BUT I have to say that the last visit was NOT good AT ALL. The bartender/server that we had looked stoned and/or messed up our drink order and the food was terrible. The ahi tuna was dull and the personal pizzas were so salty, I had to drink a gallon of water after three bites. I don't like to complain when I'm at a restaurant because I know working at a restaurant like this is not easy. So I will probably give this place one more chance since I've had good experiences in the past. I just hope to have a better experience next time around or else I just won't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2,3.6,3.03,2.932,,3.258
