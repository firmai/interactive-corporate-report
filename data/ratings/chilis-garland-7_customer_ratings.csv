Over the last year or so, they keep introducing new items and taking stuff out. I tried their new addition the sweet/smoky burger.

Next, They under-cooked my steak, I had to ask them very politely to redo it. Suggest what, this time they over-cooked it. The steak was so dry and hard as rock! After I paid through whatever little pad seats on the desk, the manager could not wait and took the pad in front of eyes, of course without my consent, and she completed the survey which is the customer rating on the food and service by herself.

38,Kevin T.,"Garland, TX",0,6,,1.0,2016-03-07,"We haven't eaten at Chilis is a long time. We had a very rare craving (off the healthy diet once a month) for chicken fried chicken with all the typical sides, mashed potatoes, corn and broccoli, and especially big fresh white and wheat rolls! We couldn't believe just how much the menu had changed. For the worst for that matter. But they still serve chicken fried chicken, or should I say a ""wanna be CFC"" for $12 bucks. Way expensive for what you actually get. I was shocked to see this little portion of chicken, and unlike before when they not only had a ""CFC"" that would meet the plates ends, the breading was horrible! Not fluffy and crunchy as they use to make, but looked more like something that was frozen from the grocery store. A frozen Marie Calendars would top this! The mashed potatoes we're probably the best part of the meal if I had to choose, and they weren't even that good. And those rolls we were looking forward to, umm.... No more! Instead a burnt piece of garlic bread now takes its place. The Chilis of yesteryear is long gone. The menu seems to be dominated by all sorts of wraps now. Everything from fried chicken finger wraps to grilled peanut chicken wraps in lettuce. Also cheddar bites (small burgers with huge buns) and all kinds of salads which I can see where some might enjoy. But after our dinner concluded, I called a couple of friends just to see if they've been to Chili's lately (which I should have done prior) and both had the same negative reviews. That all being said, there is still apparently a fairly strong few of die hard Chilis fans due to the restaurant being mostly full while we were there. Major disappointment to see all the menu changes, and more so an absolutely horrible example of what they want to call chicken fried chicken, and no rolls that every restaurant that offers this entrée should at least have as an option.  Stick with Black Eyed Pea or even Luby's for that matter if you're after good old southern style food like Chilis use to offer. Needless to say, we won't be going to Chilis anytime soon, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

Once seated it was 5 to 10 minutes before server showed up.  Once ordered it was 15-20 minutes before food arrived. Server was pleasant but think this location's service standards were on the lower end of corporate expectations. Beef nachos, cheese fries, margarita chicken, shrimp tacos, chicken quesadillas and old timer burger ordered. Both nachos and fries must have been sitting under an extremely hot heat lamp for 10 minutes plus as they were super dried out.

Because the restaurant allows SMOKING in the bar, and has no separate ventilation system or barriers to keep the cigarettes smoke from permeating through the whole restaurant.  We have a person our party whose severe asthma is triggered by cigarette smoke. She is fine in restaurants where the smoking area is separated from the nonsmoking areas by walls and a separate ventilation system.  When we asked about the smoke smell, the hostess said the RESTAURANT was non-smoking. What she tried to gloss over (presumably to save the table of 12 diners) was that the BAR in the center of the restaurant allows cigar and cigarette smoking. REALLY? If the smoke drifts unfettered and unfiltered throughout your restaurant, and permeated the ""nonsmoking"" area, I got a news flash for you: it's a SMOKING restaurant.  DUH We are not only never coming back here, we will also avoid all other Chili's which are presumably laid out the same and also allow smoking.
