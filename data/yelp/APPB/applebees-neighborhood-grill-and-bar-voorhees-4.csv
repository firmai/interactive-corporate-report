Nancy C.,"Gibbsboro, NJ",20,54,58,5.0,8/5/2012,"I had  the Spinach Salad with Chicken, Strawberris and Blueberries. Delicious! husband had the Steak with pepper, tomato, basil topping and he said it was great. We shared and enjoyed an appetizer; Spinach and Artichoke Dip.Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. I like supporting Applebees because they support veterans",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4?start=20
Ian M.,"Charlotte, NC",99,190,112,4.0,1/26/2010,This Applebees is definately one of the nicer and more frielndly Applebees that I have been to. My fiancé and I usually eat here once a week and we just love everything about the place. The best place to eat is up at the bar. Pat is there almost every night and he is just so friendly and knowledgable about the menu. The place is very clean and well kept as well.  The food portions and quality are worth every penny. I would highly suggest their burgers and fajitas. Delicious!!  We also enjoy the Blue Moon which is ice cold and on draft. Everything about th environment is just so inviting and warm. Enjoy!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4?start=20
Mike H.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",1,85,2,2.0,2/18/2013,"Friday evening at 6:00 pm, we bothered a server by placing an order. I felt bad because we were imposing on her by being seated in her section, but the place was busy and we had no choice. I felt guilty because we were clearly getting between her and wherever she would rather have been.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4?start=20
Alexis S.,"Haddonfield, NJ",143,7,,4.0,3/29/2012,"I had buffalo wings, they were awesome! I went after ten to find out that the appetizers were half off! Four dollars for a great meal?! Ill be there again soon !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4?start=20
Kitty K.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,23,,3.0,7/21/2011,"Happy hour begins with the word ""happy,"" right?  Well, I recently went here and I was not altogether happy.  The waitress was nice...although other people delivered our drinks, not our waitress...not sure if that's how it normally works.  I didn't even order from the happy hour menu/drink menu because...well, it was not anything exciting and the prices were not that much of a discount.  Sooo, the person I was with and I ordered drinks and appetizers.  Nothing fancy...nothing difficult...nothing to write home about.  Fries, chips and salsa, quesadillas...the drinks were supposed to have alcohol in them, but I drank two martinis as if they were lemonade...I am guessing heavy on the mixers, light on the alcohol.  The person sharing this fun with me drank three martinis and mentioned that he felt refreshed enough to paint a house, no alcohol effects at all.  Would I go here again?  Well, I have two more gift cards to use up and it wasn't soooo terrible, but NOT my choice for a light snack and a drink.  I'll go back just to use up the cards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4?start=20
Walton S.,"Clementon, NJ",0,10,,3.0,12/27/2011,Ordered a burger. It was alright but the fries were cold and they gave such a small portion it makes you mad to be paying $9 for it. While that is also the woes of going to chain restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4?start=20
Betsy S.,"Collingswood, NJ",1,17,14,4.0,10/29/2017,"This location always has a welcoming atmosphere, good food and good service.  And ok for women dining alone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Angel A.,"Elizabethtown, PA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,We waited for 35 minutes and nobody even came to take our drink order. We just walked out after that. Only go to the one in sommerdale if you want your drink order taken on time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Donnie M.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",29,178,208,3.0,9/23/2016,"This is right around the corner from my place and they have half price certain drinks and appetizers from 3-6 and 9-close. The food was basic, margarita barely had any alcohol but the waitress was friendly. The place was clean and each table had a screen to order, play games and pay so that was pretty neat.    For a cheap late night bite to eat you could to better or worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Joe S.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,145,131,3.0,5/28/2016,"Walking in on Friday and was able to be seated right away with a decent crowd.  Sat down and ordered the beef nachos , which were pretty filled with an assortment of your cheese, beef, jalapenos etc. Nachos were pretty good, a lot of flavor and every chip had something on it which is a plus. For entree I had the chicken fajitas with fries on the side. This dish was not for me as it was packed with tons of cheese and red onions off the chain. Though my friend got a burger and I regret not getting that as it looked pretty good haha.  Service was pretty good , drinks keep coming and they seem to be on top of their game for a busy Friday night.  If you have not been to an applebees; before they are good for groups or if you just want to come in for a quick beer. Located right next to a movie theater is always a plus if you need a place to stop in real quick. Food is of course what it is, but if your hungry I am sure you will find something to enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Justin C.,"Evesham Township, NJ",33,189,251,5.0,3/12/2017,"I remember this visit to Applebees in Voorhees vividly. To....the.....T. It was the start of the work week and I had a horrible day at work with the students and staff I deal with in my building. Wife took me to Applebees  after work for a much needed  drink and good ( not sure if I got a chance to eat lunch that day  which wouldn't be surprising). Had a Bahama mama in a tall glass, appetizers, and a sante fe salad. Applebees came through that day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Lisa V.,"Clementon, NJ",19,8,,2.0,10/9/2017,"Service was slow, cheese burger was like eating a hockey puck :( hard, burnt and dry. Had to ask for napkins and never got any silver ware..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Shaelene L.,"Clementon, NJ",204,137,289,3.0,3/6/2016,"So everything had over an hour wait, we caved and went to Applebee's. We were then reminded of why we never eat there. I would rate this Applebee's 3/5 if compared to other Applebee's. You know what you get, however this one is better Than the somerdale location. I had the pretzels and cheese which I enjoyed. They were soft and surprisingly seasoned well. The burger was sub par. Come Applebee's, gotta get a burger right.  At least the server was friendly and we sat quickly. Only pros.  If you get a food craving and just need to eat out, do yourself a favor and wait or go to 5 guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Anthony T.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",63,5,2,2.0,5/1/2016,"nice place, jazzin environment. not much potential to jip UNLESS they forget to pacifically ask you to get a blackberry ji. Pretty ok food, pretty hmmm on the the selection of dishes they use xD. Dont know how to sing the happy birthday song but a place to have fun maybe meet some men!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Bryce N.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",70,3,10,4.0,5/1/2016,"Came to Applebee's for a surprise birthday dinner.  They started us off with what they claimed to be wings but they were just chicken nuggets with wing ji on them. I feel like that was a jip so they lost one star. Other than that it was pretty epic because my fries, za sticks and chicken was good. Great place to eat and have a surprise birthday dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Theresa M.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",5,54,22,1.0,10/12/2016,This is the second time in 2 weeks I came here! Tonight will be the last! It's not the first time I've come to an Applebees and the front of the house staff was no where to be found! I end up sitting there waiting looking aimless for someone to get a damn table! I was finally seated n waited over 15 mins before I got up n looked for someone! At that point I checked with my BF n I said let's go! As we walked out I told the hostess that no one came over yet and we were leaving! She begged us to stay and I said absolutely not! If ur that incompetent that you can't do your job then I don't have time for you! I felt like I was at Buffalo Wild Wings! They r the worst on service! Meanwhile a near by server had taken the food and drink order of another table while we were waiting and I wasn't sure if she was our waitress or not but if she was she should be fired! She lost your store business and she lost my tip because I tip very well for good service ! Oh well her loss! Last time food was ok! Nothing spectacular! I prefer the Audabon store the most!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Adam T.,"Ocean City, NJ",1,9,4,5.0,4/29/2016,Great staff! Awesome location next to the movies. I always take my family hear when we are in the area. They also now have a wood smoker in the back for all the steak and chicken items. Hands down the best Applebees in the tri state area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Christian S.,"Evesham Township, NJ",221,382,353,4.0,8/21/2012,"The service here has always been great. If I ever had an issue it was resolved immediately. I like the service here so much, I get upset when I watch other people drive away without tipping their curbside runner. Yesterday, I was a little disappointed with the service. I pulled up to the curbside pick up space and it took nearly 10 minutes before someone realized that I was waiting there. Someone is usually walking out the door before I can even put the car in park. I received the same pleasant service I always do so that ten minute wait was now an after thought. Everyone can be at the top of their game all the time.  When I got home however, I realized the issue followed me home. My wife did not receive the right sirloin dinner she ordered. Further more if she was allergic to nuts the night would have been a disaster.  Despite everything that happened yesterday I am still a fan. I used to despise Applebees. I wouldn't eat there unless my supervisors were paying for lunch. I don't know if its the change in with the menu,  the way the food is prepared, or if it is just this particular establishment but, I am a fan of Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Vannessa M.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",47,10,4,2.0,2/3/2015,We went here for lunch last friday. It was terrible the boneless wings my husband ate was not cooked all the way. He ate a burger that just didn't have freshness to it. Although our waitress was very nice and seem to be very attentive. It's just the food that wasn't excellent and this is comming from a cook and his wife.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Glenn L.,"Marlton, NJ",0,8,,2.0,6/8/2015,Got a steak with veggies.  asked for steak medium rare. came out purple and raw. and the veg tastes like it was straight out of a bag an into the microwave. typical chain resturuant bs. mixed drinks are weak as hell took only good thing is there late night happy hour. no good flavors and no freshness.  Also Got the short rib nachos at the new marlton location on 70. terrible- lack of cheese and probably about 2 oz of flavorless short rib.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Meg F.,"Collingswood, NJ",38,168,4,2.0,4/18/2013,"Very meh.  I went here to meet a friend for a drink and ended up spending 3 hours and ~$35...thankfully I had a $50 gift card! Once we were seated we ended up spending getting  3 miller lites, 3 other beers (forget what my friend ordered), and 1 appetizer.  The miller lites were $5 a pop, what a rip off! The appetizer,fried green beans, was pretty good but way too salty, and the waitress didn't come back for awhile so we were not able to relay this feedback to her. My friend and I were really cold and we asked the waitress if the a/c was on, ie, a nice way of inquiring about the temperature in the restaurant. She responded with a quick 'yes' then walked away before we were able to ask her to turn it down. Um, it was 60 degrees outside, why the heck would you have the a/c on? Luckily about 10 minutes later the manager came right behind me and raised the temp (thermostat was right behind me) and lowered it for us, but didn't even ask us if we were comfortable with the temperature or how our meal was, which was pretty weird.. overall, nothing memorable - it is an applebee's after all...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Danielle M.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",0,4,,5.0,11/19/2015,"Food was good.  The 5 stars is actually for our waitress Lisa this afternoon!  Lisa went out of her way to inform us of the allergens in something we had chosen for our son to eat, and gave us a safer option.  Lisa was not only informative but efficient and very friendly!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Kristina C.,"Las Vegas, NV",160,301,40,3.0,2/7/2013,"We all know and love...we all do love Applebees right...anyways. I go here for Happy Hour sometimes and I always have a good time. It's usually easy to find a seat at the bar, the bar staff is always really nice and take good care of you, and the drinks are definitely reasonable.  I have had a few of their food items that are Gluten Free - the Fiesta Lime Chicken was good (for someone who doesn't even like Chicken) and here is a link to their allergy information which lists out soy, egg, dairy, peanut, shellfish, tree nut, wheat, fish and gluten!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Jarrett S.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",3,68,,2.0,10/8/2015,"It certainly is convenient to have curbside service and the young lady could not have been sweeter.  Although, it would have been nice to get the order right--$10 for sliders with no cheese (and yet there was globs of cheese on each) and a small bag of very cold fries. One star for getting other order correct.  I would have saved if I went to the five guys in the adjacent shopping center, and no doubt I would have enjoyed my meal much more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Michelle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3604,1785,1536,3.0,12/30/2008,"Applebee's is my least favorite sit-down chain, but this particular location gets three stars from me for three reasons.  One, the food is decent provided you don't choose anything off of the Weight Watchers menu.* Two, it is the only casual restaurant with a liquor license in the same lot as the movie theatre.  Three, this location is also in very close proximity to the Flyers Skate Zone, where practices are held.  Anything that heightens my chances of a run-in with a Flyer is a-ok with me.   Footnotes: *I have much love for WW and their invaluable points system (that helped this girl and countless others lose the freshman you-know-what), but the point-friendly Applebee's items are gross.  I whip up more flavorful and healthy recipes in my own kitchen, which is approximately two by four feet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
Jasmine R.,"Levittown, PA",2,56,1,2.0,11/14/2013,"I came here for the half price appetizers special after school one day with my boyfriend since we both have night classes. The first appetizer of cheeseburger sliders came with what it looked like old and soggy fries which were cold. My boyfriend is not a complainer so he ate them. Everything else was pretty good though, he ordered a second thing of sliders and the next one came with fresh hot fries. I just did not appreciate the cold fries with my food, these places are usually a hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-voorhees-4
