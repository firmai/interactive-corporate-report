Alma C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,64,16,3.0,6/5/2017,I was here when they first open 5 years ago with some friends and just had Cheese cake. So we decided to go in tonight. We were very surprised it only had 3 starts. Now after today I understand why. We got there at 6 we were on our table super fast. I wanted the chicken pizza with the Alfredo  sauce. It was on their special menu of the day and yep they were out. We order a Jambalaya and it was to dry we had to ask for more sauce. I ended up getting the chicken with mash potatoes and asparagus. First time my potatoes were cold. They took it back and brought it the second time the plate was super Hot. My potatoes nope were worm not Hot. The manager was great he brought them out the 3rd time and yes everyone at the table were done eating and I was just starting to eat my food. The manager did give me a dessert for free. Thanks but we are probably won't be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60
Megan C.,"Tucson, AZ",13,113,41,5.0,7/14/2016,"My family has frequented this restaurant over the years, and I've never had a bad experience. The menu is RIDICULOUS. It has page numbers. If you're craving something Asian or Mexican or a light salad or a hearty steak or healthy avocado toast, they have it all. Plus, the cheesecake! I didn't know they served regular entrees when I first came here. I was all for the cheesecake. It's a bit pricey, but you get so much food! I've never gone home without leftovers. I even had a lunch special with my last check-in and still took part of it home. I've had several chicken dishes, orange chicken, burrito, various brunch options, tacos, and several appetizers. I've probably ordered off each page of the menu at one point or another. I've never been disappointed. The best part...the cheesecake! I've stopped in just for coffee and dessert, picked it up to go (such a beautiful thing), or had it after dinner. They have so many different kinds. Even if you aren't into the typical cheesecakes, they have fruit options as well! I love the mango key lime. It's refreshing. Every cheesecake I've eaten is delicious. I typically order it to go at the end of the meal and have it over three servings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60
Aaron S.,"Tucson, AZ",76,7,1,1.0,12/10/2016,"Food 5... quality of service... ZERO... rude, slow, forgetful, ran out of bread... HOW? I can only imagine... she then let us order soup, took to long to get it... comes back 20 minutes later to ask if we got our soup... disappears for who knows how long only to return to tell us that they ran out of soup... probably because you took over 20 minutes to get it... oh wow...

Barbara P.,"Tucson, AZ",45,122,275,4.0,5/28/2016,"I cannot think of a single dish that I have tried and didn't like at the Cheesecake Factory!  Tonight my husband ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano - a favorite of ours!  It did not disappoint!   I got the Barbecue Ranch Chicken  Salad.   It was great as usual! What wasn't so impressive was the amount of time it took to get our order.  25 minutes!  That usually doesn't happen here. When it was brought out, the person who brought it asked if I wanted freshly ground black pepper.  I told him yes.  He had to go get it.  After grinding the pepper, he asked my husband if he wanted cheese on his pasta.  Of course cheese was desired..and you guessed it.....he left to go get it.  Wow!  Talk about inefficiency !  Why wouldn't you bring it with you as most people probably say yes.  If nothing else , why wouldn't you bring the cheese when you went to get the pepper?  Oh well, maybe he was new!

Ashlee V.,"Tucson, AZ",10,131,24,3.0,9/10/2016,Sad to say I was genuinely unimpressed with this particular location. First off the Service was very slow... We ordered and they claimed to be out of bread but one minute later a different sever walked by with bread for his table. We ordered our Cheesecake Factory usual and then finally bread was delivered. Our server was nice enough at first. When our food arrived we noticed that the pastas seemed very watery. And the more we tasted our food the more we saw that it was extremely watery and lacked taste. We waited for a full 10 minutes for our server to reappear.  We explained this to our server and said our daughter wasn't going to eat the watery Alfredo and asked for it to be taken off the ticket. We showed her that you could literally stir the sauce like it was milk.  This is when the server developed an attitude. Instead of being apologetic and asking if our daughter wanted something else or offering to get her another one she took the plate and became extremely standoffish. She could clearly see that the food was not right but somehow offended that we returned it. We went on to order cheesecake to go and she continued to have an attitude.  They did take my daughters meal off the ticket but she also went without dinner and they didn't seem to care. Extremely disappointed in the Tucson Cheesecake Factory!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60
Merle S.,"Kaanapali, HI",3,6,,4.0,7/4/2017,"So...two years later and we thought we'd give Cheesecake another try. We went for the happy hour and had a great time!  The server, Alex, was very attentive, the food was served promptly and was freshly prepared, the drinks well made.  All in all, in addition to the obviously fantastic , wonderfully made cheesecake, it was a 180 degree different experience than our last visit!

Omar F.,"Tucson, AZ",82,7,,1.0,9/12/2016,"Lord help my anus region, I ordered the orange chicken and it tasted like burnt orangutan, the brown rice tasted like 90 second rice.

Chris S.,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",139,647,401,4.0,6/10/2016,"Typical and predictable. It's a big chain but the service is good, tons of menu choices, prices are fair enough, ambiance is nice.

Rayne M.,"Tucson, AZ",33,54,79,4.0,5/5/2015,"Can I just say as the Elite Dessert Decider this is a go to place! My goal is to try eer flavor of cheesecake they bake! So far, I must confess I have really only tried the pure chocolate ones.  -Chocolate Mousse -s'more -Godiva Chocolate -Chocolate anniversery -Banana creame The chocolate ones are all   and the banana was actually my favorite of them all! The presentation of the cheesecakes come out so beautiful you almost hate to eat it! ( i may hate to eat it but let me tell you...i devour it!)   As for the rest of the food it always tastes amazing! I like the loaded tots and the baja tacos. The food is very pricy so prepare to dip into the wallet, even more if getting dessert because dessert runs $7+. I would never go there if I was not ordering the cheesecake but hey if im already there I mind as well try to eat some food with malnutrition value before the cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60
Glenn A.,"Winchester, CA",3,164,44,2.0,8/22/2016,"I haven't been to a Factory in a while. Portions are still too big and probably full of your daily caloric count. Perfectly cooked medium rare classic burger but requested condiments initially were missing. Ending up with a very soggy bun. Nice environment. They spend a lot on decorations. Cloth napkins. Clean. This still is a place that if you share dishes and save room for shared cheesecake you will be happy. Sadly, I don't think our waiter liked his job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60
Rob L.,"San Jose, CA",92,469,99,3.0,1/25/2015,"Good place for a kid birthday More a fan of Cheesecake Factory for their desserts. Horrible for your BMI mind you, but oh so good when eating. There are more cheesecake flavors than NFL teams. We've had maybe six and all are yummers. Food is standard fare and I find it unremarkable. Good options for kids though, so it's a standard choice we can all agree on for a meal. This location is nice-- clean, attractive, active staff, and relatively quick for a table. They were also very cool to sing to my daughter for her birthday. (Tip: they used to comp the birthday person's dessert, but do not appear to do that anymore, or at least this location doesn't.) Service crew was nice and quick with drinks. However, the timing of dishes was random and our last person started eating almost ten minutes after the first person's dish arrived and we had to ask three times for missing utensils. On a better, more consistent service day, I'd probably give them four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60
Adam F.,"Flagstaff, AZ",45,317,1615,3.0,6/24/2015,"Almost three years later, I am updating my review for The Cheesecake Factory. This place has not changed at all since that 7/7/2012 review. The service was much better back then, but there is nothing bad about it now. They are very willing to accommodate specific orders. This is important because anyone who does their research on the food at this restaurant should know that the average dish contains two/three day's worth of one's sodium and sugar intake. They also have rolled out a menu designed to be a healthier alternative, but still watch out for the sodium in that. To me, The Cheesecake Factory is not a place where I would eat frequently. This is a special occasion type of place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60

Nickol O.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,,2.0,3/7/2017,"It was my mothers in laws 60th bday an we decided to treat her to a nice meal and desert! When we arrived the lobby was rather busy and we put our name down for a wait of 10-15 mins for 3 people. As coupes started being seated after arriving we noticed that we must have some how been skipped? I went to double check and our name wasn't written down or got lost? Must have waited 25 minutes instead of the 10-15 that was quoted. One seated my mother in law was ordering her favorite chicken Alfredo! The chicken Alfredo arrived and absolutely tasted horrible there was no creamy sauce it reminded me of large noodles in a pizza sauce. I felt horrible as it was her bday and we argued to bring her here instead of the Olive Garden! We notified the sever and she said  there were new cooks in the kitchen and they are still learning the ropes!  She politely comped the meal on our ticket. Secondly, the even more sad part is my mom always loved the Khalua Cheesecake! She placed her order and the server came back probably almost with a lump in her throat, and notified us that the Cheesecake was not taken off the menu so they no longer had it! At this point I'm literally about to cry! I feel absolutely horrible that this was her birthday experience! For the bill the service was great our server was very apologetic, but the price of what we received was not worth it. I'm sad because I loved the Cheesecake Factory and have always had good experiences but I'm unsure if I will be returning after this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=60

John R.,"Tucson, AZ",21,154,,4.0,3/9/2014,"They did a huge about-face after I complained to corporate - read my previous review to see why I called corp.  Btw, corporate did send me an apology gift card which is what we used to revisit them. Now: - Hostesses are attentive and polite, and actually genuine - Menus were completely cleaned - Our server, Steven, introduced himself and told us the soup of the day (as there are no specials at lunch time) - Steven was also perfect with his timing - food came out fast, accurate, and refills were stupendous.  He also made a couple of great jokes and was overall great. - We got both kinds of bread (yum) - When the food was delivered, the wait staff was very careful in how they handled our plates as to not touch the food - I had a very minor complaint about one of the shrimp not being de-veined and the server told the manager, who promptly came over to apologize (very nice touch) - The Hershey's cheesecake was divine as I remembered it before our previous visit.  Moist, tasty and fresh. The only thing they need to improve, and this will obviously take a while, is the service staff needs to stop standing in front of their guests while chatting about their personal bar experience last night.  Steven did not do this, but several female staff members did and I think it's tacky.  But I understand why they do it - their server stations are not partitioned off, like other restaurants they probably previously worked at, so it's an adjustment.  But not the end of the world. Great job Cheesecake Factory - way to turn it around.  I'm a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=120

Both the potion and quality of the food would make me satisfied. By the way, I love the bread they offer! Every time I told myself ""hey, you already order a main dish! Stop eating these bread, which would make you so full!"" But I just can't control myself and even ask the waiter to give me one more basket of bread after I finish all these bread. However, though the food is good, I would say the waiter here is not really friendly. When I ask her what would she recommend, she looks like she doesn't really want to introduce anything to us but just want to get our order and get rid of us.

Jon H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,,2.0,3/8/2015,"We have had some good, mediocre, and bad experiences at this particular cheesecake factory.  We went there for dinner on Saturday, March 7th.  Our server was Ben. I am not sure if he had too many tables, or what, but he is not an attentive server.  The first thing he did after approaching our table was tell us that the bread was still in the oven.  Seemed reasonable. However, about 10 - 15 minutes later, we noticed that other tables were getting bread.  I had to stop the server to ask him about the bread.  From then on, I took note of how often the other servers were checking on the tables around us compared to our server.   It was clearly an issue of the other servers would check on their tables three to four times more than our server checked on us.  He was very inattentive and pretty much made for a poor dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=120

James H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,4.0,6/12/2014,"Tonight, I went to the Cheesecake Factory in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated by one of the hostesses who quickly provided menus. The first thing I noticed as soon as I sat down was that the table was sticky and had crumbs scattered about. After getting up and locating a manager, I informed him of the situation and he was incredibly polite and efficient, sending a busboy to wipe down the table and apologizing the whole way. Next, we  got our food. My girlfriend ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken and  I ordered the Southern Fried Catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, and asparagus (substituted for the green beans) upon the server's recommendation. Our server, Mark V. was incredibly polite and quick with everything, always refilling our drinks without being asked.  Now, the pasta was fine with the exception of the chicken which was painfully dry,  both myself and my girlfriend needed to take heavy swigs of our drinks in order to wash the chicken down entirely.  The catfish was horrible, with an incredibly heavy and overdone breading which required me to chisel it out with a blunt end of a fork., I literally proceeded to remove the breading to eat the fish, which was flavorless and limp. I literally stopped eating due to the amount of work and the sheer lack of flavor, leaving most of the food untouched.  We brought this up to the manager, who was incredibly polite and removed the catfish from the final check on the spot, offering to either make another order or allow me to try something different from the menu. Due to the time of night (about 2130) and not wanting to subject the kitchen staff to extra prep work and cooking, I decided to just have the item removed and proceeded to order a slice of the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake to go.  Overall, I'd like to say that the experience was pleasant, catfish notwithstanding. The server and manager were polite and observant, answering our questions and addressing all concerns.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=120
Ayla R.,"Seattle, WA",172,289,129,5.0,2/8/2015,"Cheesecake is a good ole standby! It is by far the most grand looking building within a mile of the Tucson mall and the interior is pretty captivating. You know most of it is great paint and partical board, but it doesn't make it less beautiful. C and I enjoy this place for lightly late night food and man oh man, do they have food! This business boasts a menu that is thicker than any children's book and has over 250 dishes. This ranges from pizza to asian lettuce wraps, burgers and pasta. The fascinating thing, they hit the nail on the head dish after dish. How one kitchen can have so many cuisines so well represented and produced is a wonder! Their wine list is comprehensive and they probaby have killer desserts. I behave and have never touched one.  They have a fair amount of items that with very minor modifications can be made vegan. Their Kale and Quinoa Salad can be made vegan and is my personal favorite It is a massive portion of hearty kale and quinoa with grapes and other suprising flavors. Their thai lettuce wraps are traditionally with chicken, but if you sub that with avocado you have a gorgeous display of an array of fillings for some flavorful wraps! The majority of their pastas are vegan and they have few sauces as well. The marinara, roasted tomato, thai pasta sauce and thai peanut sauce are all vegna friendly! Matt is by far the best server. He greets you with a genuine smile and always gives prompt, efficient service. He knows the ins and outs of the menu like he wrote it and you always feel like a genuine guest in his home. I always ask if Matt is there and if he is, his service is worth any wait! I highly suggest asking for their superstar server, Matt!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=120

I have never ordered anything that didn't taste great. I ADORE their veggie burger, beautiful presentation and patty. The ambience is always lovely and warm.  Definitely recommend for a date night or even a casual lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=120
Willanne W.,"Vail, AZ",40,144,123,2.0,8/18/2011,"Lunched here last week to celebrate my birthday with some girlfriends.  I selected it as I really, really wanted cheesecake for my birthday! After checking out the menu from the library.. well, it just seems like a book, it is so extensive, we finally made up our minds.   Both of my friends ordered the chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The sandwiches were huge.  They found them tasty and I sampled the sweet potato fries -- very nice.  Trying to save room and justify dessert, I had the lunch portion of Cobb Salad.  The lettuce  was really ""chopped"" up which I don't care for and a number of the ingredients were tossed with it along with the dressing.  It was very bland and unattractive!  How can you mess up a Cobb Salad?  Only the bleu cheese had any flavor.  Wah, Wah, Wah! Fine, I thought, at least I'll have cheesecake.  Having not eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in probably 20+ years, it took a while to figure out which cheesecake to settle upon.  I opted for the Dulce De Leche, one friend had the Red Velvet and the other had the Snickers Bar.  They were all tasty but that true creaminess of genuine cheesecake just wasn't there!  Where did it go and what was in its place?  Frankly, the taste left on the palate was one of inferior ingredients and an oiliness I associate with ""Cool Whip"" or some other super hydrogenated oil based pseudo food product.  Wah Wah Wah.  But, I still licked my plate! If you want real cheesecake, I'd recommend a slice of Cheesecake heaven at Modern Bakery in Boston, MA (see my review!). The service was fine, the menu was frankly too long and involved, the salad mediocre and the cheesecake disappointing although very attractive!  I doubt I'll go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=120

Tiffany S.,"Baltimore, MD",91,305,159,4.0,5/12/2013,"I think that this is one of the ver few sit-down national chain that I actually like going back to. Which is funny because I distinctly remember in SF not being a fan of the non-desert food options. When did they manage to convert me???? Well at any rate, there are a few favorites. The top of the list is the Navajo. I love Native American fry bread (who doesn't love fried bread?), however, it's harder to find. Here they turn it into a sandwich with moist chicken and some yummy sauce. The fried bread makes it decadent heaviness, the only problem is that it's difficult to justify a cheesecake purchase after eating.  My other favorite is on the lighter side menu, the farro and beet salad very flavorful and well balanced. Needless to say the cheesecake is great with lots of flavors to select from",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=140

We arrived a little early and put our name in - they don't take reservations. The wait was reasonable for CF on a Friday night at 7:30pm.  I had been craving a Cuban sandwich and they had one on their (giant) menu. I excitedly ordered it. The waitress was sorry, but they were out of pork. Bummer! I ordered the fish tacos instead.  Fish tacos came out, but no beans. What's rice with no beans? The waitress went to get me beans, comes back, and they're out of them as well. Okay ... cheesecake time. Waitress recommends the dulce de leche. I order it. She comes back - they're out of that too! Literally, they were out of everything I ordered. The food I (and others) did get - crab and artichoke dip, salad - was mediocre. I wouldn't get the fish tacos again.

As far as the food goes, I've found the things that I like and don't like, and tend to be a creature of habit; so, in terms of that- the burgers, fries, and pastas are pretty good. I'm not a fan of the house dressing (it actually overwhelms the flavor of the salad itself) and as far as steak goes- a bit too salty for me, although I'm not one to typically add salt to my food. Overall, the food is pretty consistent. The drinks are prepared well if you're into that and I'm a fan of their house margarita.

The young lady said ""here is your salad with NO ONIONs"". Wrong!!!! It has ONIONs!!!! She offered to make me another salad and I said it would take to long since mom was done with her lunch.

Our waiter was really friendly, and reminded us of Ross from Friends both in terms of personality and apperance. My friend's daughter had a lot of questions about the menu and he was very patient with her. Ended up customizing a meal for her based on what she wanted, and brought out special sauces for her to try until she remembered which she liked best. We started out with some delicious drinks, and decided to split a couple appetizers from the super cool skinnylicious menu. For those that are unfamiliar with how The Cheesecake Factory rolls, the typical portions are HUGE and very high calorie. I learned a while ago that I can noteat one of the normal entrees if I have any desire to get a piece of cheesecake (and really, why would you go to the CHEESECAKE Factory and NOT get a piece?!) The three apps we shared were: Avocado Eggrolls - Not a Skinnylicious item but honestly...  I can't remember the last time I went to The Cheesecake Factory and didn't order these. My tried and true favorite, love the creamy and crunchy texture.  Crispy Crab Bites - Skinnylicious! Perfectly cooked, perfectly sized. Would order again. Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos - Also Skinnylicious, and they have three types.. We had the Mediterranean style which came with feta cheese, kalamata olives and tzatziki sauce. My least favorite of the apps we ordered but they were still good.  Sadly, I ended up eating too much to get cheesecake, despite my efforts not to. BOO! Since we were celebrating a birthday, 'Ross' our waiter brought out a minmi desert for the birthday lady, on the house, and he also got his coworkers to sing and embarass my friend.

I was concerned that the Veggie Burger had beets mixed into it as I don't like beets but I couldn't taste them at all.

Robert C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,2.0,3/1/2017,"This was definitely not our first trip to Cheesecake Factory but may have been our last... my wife and I came in on a Saturday night, waited 35 mins to be seated which wasn't too bad. I got a beer and sat and talked with my wife. We took a look at some menus and decided to go with the chicken Alfredo and my wife got the chili with rice. We waited about 25 mins and my wife's dish came out first. A min or so later my dish came out and the first thing I noticed when she set it down on our table was a big black hair resting on top. She turned and left and I pulled the dish in for a closer look to confirm my sighting. It was in fact a hair and I called the waitress back immediately. She was quick to take it away to fix it (as the general rule with that situation is to get it off the floor asap) and a few moments later a manager came to speak with us. He simply apologized and said they do their best to minimize hairs and that they do wear hair nets. I wondered why dishes weren't checked or given a final once over before going to the customer.... They did bring me out a new dish in about 5 minutes but this time it was missing the parsley but I was starving and already had to send it back once so i kept it. At first the dish was great and I had taken maybe 7 bites but it quickly got bland as my hunger was suppressed. The chicken seemed to be unseasoned and the pasta was missing the garnish. Not to mention my wife's dish was also bland and lacking spices.    At the end our waiter offered asked us if we wanted a piece of cheesecake which we assumed would be gifted for the wait and hair in our dish but were surprised to find it and the full amount of our dinner on our bill.  Perhaps it was poor judgement on our part to assume MGMT would compensate us anything for the hair but the same thing happened at Oregano's a couple years ago and they comped the item.. either way Cheesecake Factory did not.  We tipped our server $7 and took home our leftovers which tasted even worse next meal.  ========================================= Update 2.24.17 Cheesecake Factory guest services called me yesterday and asked me about my experience and told me they would be contacting the location about it. Then today I got an email with a $50 gift card and an invitation to try them again. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised and will mos def be visiting them again in the future.  ========================================= Update 3.1.17 - My wife and I went back to the same location tonight for dinner. I ordered a beer, the Turkuy club with avocado, and the s'mores Cheesecake. My wife ordered the strawberry lemonade, shrimp scampi, and the lemon cheesecake. Everything was terrific and we let satisfied. Our water was pleasant and the evening was as well. Will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=20

Marc S.,"Tucson, AZ",59,21,1,5.0,7/26/2013,"First I will start with, I'm picky. I've even taught customer service seminars. My first visit to the talked about Cheesecake Factory was outstanding. I met my daughter there for her birthday. The place looked busy so I thought the customer service my lax a little...nope. We were greeted promptly by not one but two servers. (one was in training, however you would never know it.) Our drinks were ordered and quickly came. Plus a often overlooked aspect, they asked if we wanted water with our drinks. (so many places miss this small gesture.) I ordered the Chicken Madeira. Our food came out quite quickly for as busy as it was. (OMG! It was awesome!) I tried each of my families foods. (Chicken Alfredo, Mini-Corn Dogs, Won tons, etc.) All were flawless. Finally came dessert. (You can't be at the Cheesecake factory and not get a cheesecake.) I ordered the Cherry Cheesecake and my daughter ordered the original. I was not disappointed. Tasted just like my moms home made cherry Cheesecake...yum! We got the bill and to my surprise it was reasonable.

Emily O.,"Kihei, HI",258,149,70,4.0,7/27/2010,"I can't help but express confusion whilst dining at the Cheesecake Factory.  There's a million items on the menu, making it extremely difficult to narrow your options.  And what the heck is with the decor?!  It's like Candyland, meets Egyptian goddess, meets Italian styled ceiling art?  However, I have been twice and have left pleasantly plump and happy both times. If you are a dieter...forget it.  Nothing on the menu is calorie friendly.  Even the ""Weight Management Salads"" are packed with 590 calories!  The Cheesecake Factory is meant for everyone to forget about the fat/calorie intake, and splurge a little.  I have indulged in the Asian Chicken Salad, which was fantastic.  I've tried the herb crusted salmon as well, which was also fabulous.  However, I do have to say the Red Velvet Cheesecake is worth writing home about times 10!!  YUM YUM YUM.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=220
Breelyn S.,"Sun City, AZ",2,11,6,1.0,9/24/2013,"Based on my expirence I will not be coming back... This place is ridicoulous. I was there last sunday about 3ish They forgot to bring out the birthday cake I had brought for my friend. -I came in before i picked up my friend flr lunch to drop her cake off. I asked the hostess to put it in the freezer. I EVEN ASKED HER TO REMEBER ME. I told her i would be back in 40 minutes with the bday girl. I want her check and the cake to be brought out for a suprise dessert. When we finished our meal our server comes over and hands us a dessert menu! I was freaking out because at that moment i realized the server didnt know about the cake! I walked over to the hostess that i spoke with earlier. I told her i dont think the waiter knows about the cake. And she goes ""what cake"" ARE YOU KDDING ME TO FORGET SOMETHING IS ONE THING BUT FOR ME TO COME UP AND REMIND YOU AND YOU STILL CANT REMEBER THAT IS JUST FLAT OUT CARELESSNESS. At that point my friend got suspicous of what was going on. When i sat back down i watched the hostess to make sure she would tell my server. AN SHE STILL DIDNT!!! After 3 minutes of watching her stand at the hostess stand i went and told the server myself. He was also unaware that i wanted to pay for the bday girls bill. My server was way to busy and overwhelemed - our server was nice however we waited for 12 minutes without getting greeted. When he finally did come by he said ""hi ladies it will be just one more minute."" IVE ALREADY BEEN WAITING FOR 12. He came back 5 minutes later and it took him a intial 4 minutes to get the drinks out. THAN when he dropped off the drinks i told him im ready to order an he said oh i will be back in a just a moment! REALLLY ?! I was already there for almost 30 minutes. He took about 5 minutes to come back and take our order. Even though he was the one that provided us service i blame management. When i looked around he was serving ALOT OF TABLES. Management should know how much each server can handle. I felt bad for our server even though he was Wpissing me off. I would provide the same sucky service if i had as many tables as him too!  The only thing good was the food but it was pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=220

I couldn't finish my meal (already full), so I got a piece to go. An hour later, I dived in, and discovered the cheesecake wasn't very cheesecakey. It was still good though... Okay 3 1/2 stars.

Lavender G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,19,,3.0,8/8/2011,"I have gone here several times and was pleased with it.  However, My husband and I went Saturday night for an early dinner (which means it was not crowded yet and there were plenty of empty tables).  We sat on the patio, which is nice even in the Tucson heat, and the misters were going full force.  It was unfortunate that they sat us in the middle of the patio where we were basically soaked by the misters.  Well, our bodies weren't soaked, but our table and everything on it kept getting very wet, and we had to continually wipe things off!  I know the value of having misters in the summer heat here in the desert, but this was ridiculous.  Since the service seemed to be very slow for some reason (did I say it was not crowded?) we decided to relocate to a table that was a little more sheltered.  They really should have removed the tables that were closest to the misting and only used those on the peripheral, even if it meant that later on a few parties may have to wait a little longer to be seated.  Our server was very friendly, perhaps a bit too much so.  He was a ""cool"" dude who had all the right comments and facial expressions as well as proper hand gestures that would put him into the ""cool"" category.  I dunno...I have become more annoyed recently with people in jobs that service the public.  They seem to think they need to become my new best friend, and it's cute at first but after a few minutes of it I do become quite annoyed and just wish they would do their job.  I like friendly and pleasant, but let's draw a line.  Anyway, the food was good...we split a burger plate and side salad, and it was great that we did otherwise we never would have been able to eat a full one each.  The waiter tried his best to talk us into a piece of cheesecake for dessert, but we really were too full and prefer to not take one ""to go"".  I promised the waiter I would return very soon and enjoy a piece of cheesecake and cup of coffee and he was happy with that.  LOL Could have been a better experience, but the food here is usually very good and their menu has so many choices it is often hard to make a decision.  My recommendation?  Go there for lunch and just have piece of cheesecake and some coffee...you'll be glad you did!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=220
Jennifer P.,"La Grange, IL",0,3,,1.0,8/11/2012,I am writing about the horrific experience I just had at the Tucson cheesecake factory.  To start the evening we were informed there were no ribeye steaks after we had ordered.  That was the least disturbing part of the evening.  Our appetizers arrives and the wrong dressing was mixed on our salad-still tolerable.  While waiting for our entrees the bar area where we were seated slowly became the place to hang out for all the under age college kids-most of which were beyond intoxicated and clearly not of age.  There was a steady parade people to and from the outside seating area which unfortunately the door Was located next to our table.  Several girls were allowed to parade in and out without shoes...BAREFOOT!! They were allowed to sit at the bar tables BAREFOOT!!  I have always thought of the cheesecake factory as a higher class restaurant than what I witnessed tonight.  As a young physician just the health code violations were astonishing to me.  The Service was subpar and the intoxicated underage college students inappropriately dressed for even the lowest quality establishment was unacceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=220

Now for the cheesecake, I remember it being around $6 for a slice.  My guests liked the banana cream the best.  A couple of the servers said that they liked the dulce de leche and the white chocolate raspberry.  I think the cheesecake is good, especially for a special treat for a house party because it's not something my friends would normally buy themselves.  As far as the food, I just prefer supporting some of our creative local restaurants when you want someplace nice. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=220
Steven L.,"Tucson, AZ",2,39,,4.0,7/20/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory to me, is a more ""upscale"" sit down family style fast food restaurant (think Applebee's, Friday's, et al.).

I am actually surprised at some of the negative reviews for this place. I have never had a negative experience in the many locations across the country that I've gone to. The Tucson and Chandler, AZ locations were no different. The portions are huge. I consider myself an eater and I have yet to finish my appetizers and my main course.

Jack T.,"Tucson, AZ",92,62,10,3.0,2/7/2010,"I'm eating leftover fried mac and cheese balls as I'm typing this.  It was reheated in the microwave.  It's still divine.  It's a chain restaurant so I won't bother going in-depth.  Visit their website if you want visuals, they all look pretty much the same.  Here's the run-down on service and food if you've never been here. There was a 30-minute wait at about 9:30pm Saturday.  The main hostess was extremely friendly and smiley.  I asked the hostess that was walking me to the table, ""How are you?"" and she decided to tell me how busy the place and how much she loved it, then forced a smile.  She was either overenthusiastic about her job or the restaurant implanted a chip in her brain to make sure she would be shocked whenever she frowned. The server was nice and knowledgeable.  She was about average when it comes to attentiveness, but the bussers paid excellent attention to refills and bread.   The bread comes out warm.  It comes in both French and rye with little packaged pads of butter.  Here's what I ordered: 1-Patrón ""El Diablo"" which had Patrón Silver, Cointreau, Grapefruit, Pomegranate.  It was strong and tasty but tasted hardly like grapefruit or pomegranate. My companion ordered a sangria, which was unimpressive and more tannic than refreshing. 2-Crispy Artichoke Hearts, Lemon Garlic Dip The dip is heavy but the artichokes were irresistable. 3-Ahi Tuna Tartare, Avocado, Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce  The four chips were too greasy but the rest of the appetizer melted in my mouth delightfully. 4-Beets, Goat Cheese, Apples, Baby Arugula, Pecans Simple combination of good ingredients.  There weren't enough beets for me to consider it a beet dish though. 5-Fried Mac and Cheese Balls, Creamy Marinara The ideal blend of gooey and creamy.  The accompanying creamy marinara sauce was way too sweet and wasn't necessary at all to enjoy the dish. 6- Crispy Crab Wontons, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts, Sweet Chili. Worse part of the meal.  The sweet chili sauce was way too vinegary and made the whole thing taste like pickles.  Literally.  The water chestnuts don't go well with the crispy wonton wrapper. I ate too much to have room for cheesecake.  Blasphemy, I know.  I'll try it next time.

Alma B.,"Gilbert, AZ",79,146,56,4.0,3/1/2010,"My family and I visited this place on a recent tuesday evening, we got there before 6pm, checken in with the Hostess who gave us a pager and  a 15 minute wait time estimate.  As it normally happens, the pager was vibrating when it was handed to me, and the hostess told me it would do the same when ready, so I walk aside to wait, pager in hand and everything seems fine just one little thing is odd, pager NEVER STOPPED vibrating! Now having worked as a hosstes before, the last thing I wanted to say was ""It's vibrating already"" because seriously people that joke gets annoying. Fast. Thinking that maybe the pager was  broken I walked up to the hosstes and informed her that my pager had not stopped vibrating since she had handed it to me, to which she responded: Oh that's because your table is ready. Really. Then why was I handed a pager in the first place? I hand her my pager and she tells me to stand to the side and we would be taken to our table, and so we did, we stood and stood and stood, and hosts came and went asking us if we were, X,Y,Z, party of 1,2,3, but never Alma party of 4. After 10 min of standing I went and asked the hosstes if we would be seated shortly, she asked me if we had checked in, so I explained to her, bla,bla,bla someone finally came and took us to our table.  Finally settled at a table we begun to peruse the menu. Ordered some avocado eggrolls as an appetizer, which turned out to be very yummy, not the best I have tried but they satisfied. Entrees included the Chicken and Biscuits, Wasabi Crusted Tuna and a BBQ Salmon dish. These were all very large portions, and surprisingly on the Tuna side very delicious too. The menu is huge and I felt like I needed a Cheesecake Factory menu for dummies just to get through it all.

In reviewing  keep in mind I hold a place that charges 12 dollars for a sandwich at a much higher standard than a fast food joint. Today I ordered the new macaroni and cheese burger == described as a gourmet burger with oozing fried mac and cheese on the burger-- $12.75 -- I ordered mine with mayo and asked that it be cut in half-- I got it a long time later-- no mayo--not cut in half. Mac and cheese was a patty of mac and cheese that had been deep fried-- and it was cold-- the meat luke warm -- the sliced tomato cut hours before and the sliced onion old-- the  service was slow and the server was not attentive and as I got impatient waiting for a refill of iced tea ( a long wait) I decided to go get it myself-- only then did she appear form some where.   My wife had a salad that she reports not too bad and generous but the fried onion rings were stone cold making it very greasy and unappealing. The bread basked brought to the table was dried out so much that I could bang it on the table like a gavel-- really you could not get your teeth into it-- I told the waitress and demonstrated the hardness-- she said ""oh my"" and swept it up and hurried off towards the kitchen-- but did not bring back more( that was probably a blessing) I think something was up in the kitchen and the front too-- someone must have been missing or chaos had replaced order--  a great price for a big disappointment!!!!

Kathy N.,"Tucson, AZ",235,375,643,4.0,2/4/2013,"Alcohol and cheesecake, the perfect remedy for a sucky day for four hard working executive assistants, right? My girls and I came here tonight to celebrate a birthday among us and to catch up on each other's lives.  I've been to this Cheesecake Factory three times now and it gets better with each visit. I arrived first tonight and waited in the roomy and open waiting area. The seating is pretty much blocked from the hostess area view and while it got a little busy with evening diners, it was comforting to know I wasn't forgotten sitting there by myself. Two different hostesses checked on me during the 10 minute wait before my friends showed. Cocktails were in order and once seated and bread and water (didn't even have to ask for water!) were put on the table, we placed our drink orders. I prefer tequila over any other spirit but hate that typical tequila drinks are either some version of a margarita or some sickeningly sweet concoction. The Firefly surprised me with its pleasant but not too sweet taste.  Silver tequila with passion fruit, blood orange and a little splash of Prosecco. A pretty little garnish of an orange peel curl topped my drink. Just a sip or two and I was in my happy place. Two girls ordered Little House Salads to go with their meals and they looked like average salads with a nice mixture of greens. The ""Little"" salads were very generously portioned. The Shrimp with Angel Hair was full of plump shrimp and substituting penne for the angel hair was no problem.  Dynamite Shrimp was a hit and devoured quickly. One friend ordered the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wrapped Tacos and they were much larger than she thought they'd be. Pretty sure she enjoyed them. I went with the Chicken Madeira and it was delicious. Extremely tender chicken breast filets topped with gooey, melted mozzarella, asparagus and mushrooms along with a light Madeira sauce. Served with mashed potatoes made it a super comfort food to appease the craptastic day I'd had. We shared a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake and the caramel, fluffy tanginess was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Our server brought out a little ice cream sundae after she heard us talking about a birthday and she readily obliged us by NOT gathering her fellow wait staff to sing to and embarrass my friend. Prices are a little high in my opinion but like I said, this is my third visit so I guess the price isn't out of my comfort zone. Super helpful and efficient staff makes the dining experience that much better. Happy birthday Michele!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=100
Peggy B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,5,,5.0,9/27/2014,"This is a narrative for a to-go order I placed at The Cheesecake Factory on Sept. 26, 2014... I called the restaurant at 12:48 PM.  The phone was answered in four rings with ""Thank you for calling the Cheesecake Factory, this is Alyssa, how may I help you?""  I told her I would like to place a to-go order and she asked if she could put me on hold while she transferred me to the bakery to place my order.  I agreed and was placed on hold for about 40 seconds.  There was light pop music while on hold.  Anissa answered the phone in the bakery and I placed my order.  She asked if I would like some complimentary bread & butter and salad with my sandwich, and I accepted.  Anissa asked what kind of dressing I would like, and I said Italian.  She said they have a Balsamic Vinaigrette and asked if that would be okay.  I agreed and she asked for my name and phone number.  I gave them to her, and she told me my order would be ready in 15 - 20 minutes.  I thanked her and ended the call. I walked up to the door and noticed a few cigarette butts on the walkway outside the restaurant.  The front door was smudge free and the entryway was clean.  The temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable and the lighting and music levels were appropriate.  The hostess smiled and said ""Hi"".  I paused and said ""I'm here to pick up a to-go order.""  She said ""Oh, okay, you can pick it up at the bakery"" while gesturing to the bakery off to the left.  I thanked her and went to the bakery to pick up my order.  The bakery case was sparkling clean and full with appealing cakes.  Anissa greeted me enthusiastically; she smiled and made eye contact.  She said ""Hi, can I get you something?"".  I told her my name, and that I was there to pick up a to-go order.  She said ""Oh, yes, we just pulled that up for you"".  She proceeded to place three boxes in a Cheesecake Factory branded bag with utensils and napkins.  She asked if I wanted to add dessert to my order, and I declined.  Anissa rang up the order and I paid with cash. After I received my order, a gentleman I assume was a manager smiled and thanked me for my order while I was exiting the restaurant. I had ordered an Italian sandwich with complimentary salad and bread/butter.  The Italian sandwich was cool and served on crispy Ciabatta bread.  The fillings were plentiful and delicious.  A creamy white sauce was served on the side without a request.  The salad was crisp and fresh.  It was served with a Vinaigrette dressing on the side.  The sourdough bread was fresh and slightly warm, and served with several cool pats of butter.

Let's start with the 'Host'?  If you even want to call it that.  This guy is in his early twenties with dark brown hair, wears glasses (didn't catch the name)...anyhow, you enter the door and there's No Smile from him, no customer service skills whatsoever, and he decided to joke about how many kids I had by over counting the amount of ppl I had in my party.  If we had stayed instead of taking our order to go, I thought in the back of my mind of complaining to the manager.  (I'm not the type of person who likes to confront ppl about their employees, etc, but it was so bad)  I can't even believe the guy got hired here, I know it's a chain restaurant, but it makes the whole place look bad and even at McDonalds they have better customer service.  Plus I know it wasn't just me because upon leaving, I watched a couple come in to get ignored by this guy.  No greeting, because he was far to busy getting a plastic bag. The waitress was fine, nothing to complain about.  But the $12 or so dollar salad we ordered, the 'Chicken and Avocado' was a RIP OFF!  There was like 5 slivers of something that resembled chicken, and there were literally like 3 or 4 tiny pieces of avocado.  It was just a bunch of iceberg lettuce.  If we hadn't taken it to go we most definitely would have complained.   So the one star is for the cheesecake.  I don't think they can mess that up.  I don't think it's even made there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=100

I opted for the skinnylicious vegetable salad (saving my calories for cheesecake, duh!). It was soooo tasty. The BF went for the fish tacos tempura style.

Meat was delicious! Seemed to be simply seasoned but I like that! The meat wasn't dry or tough, the asparagus and potatoes that it came with were good too. My only complaint, and this is just personal preference, is that the mushrooms/sauce they put on it was too sweet. I don't like my meat to be sweet...at least my red meat...so I didn't like that too much. If you're like me, maybe ask for the mushrooms/sauce on the side? Again, it's not that the food was bad, it's just I don't like my meat savory AND sweet, just savory.

I also had the portobello, avocado and zucchini fries with garlic dip and chipotle dip. The batter was nice, crunchy and just thick enough.  The old fashion burger was juicy with a great bun. The fish and chips tasted good and had a good batter, however the fries had a little too much salt. The strawberry shortcake is huge! And made with what looks like fresh biscuits.  The lemon meringue cheesecake had the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  Alex made the experience a 5 star, he never seemed irritated  (even when we kept forgetting things and he had to run back to the kitchen 5 times).

We had 7 in our group, and our table was put together quite quickly. It took a little bit for our server to get to us. When he did arrive, Brandon did a great job and I have no complaints about him. He gave us fresh bread when requested and kept our water glasses filled. Unfortunately, it took a long time for us to get our meals. I know meals for 5 adults and 2 kids might take longer than most, but we waited a good half hour between ordering and receiving our food. The food wasn't anything spectacular and my meal could've used more salt and some spice. I shared the Snickers cheesecake for dessert that absolutely blew my mind. Brandon boxed up my leftovers (always appreciated because I always make a mess).  While we were there, he was given a group of about 25 girls from out of town, yet he did not neglect his duties to our table.

My meal came first and I really hate that. I like to eat WITH my husband. About seven minutes later his sandwich finally came, but not his salad. And his sandwich needed mustard. We waited and waited and finally the server came back and said the salad was coming and he was sorry, which allowed my husband the opportunity to ask for mustard. We still waited. By now, I'm done with my meal. And it was the best turkey burger I've ever had, but I'm mad because my husband is still waiting. He went to get the manager and she made it right by taking the sandwiches off our bill, which was all she could do at that point; I appreciate that very much.

So just to make sure I cut open all the pieces of steak just to confirm. The waitress was very professional. She took the hot mess off the table and brought a new plate out which was cooked perfectly. I just wish they had gotten it right the first time as I had never waited that long for a meal at this restaurant.

Later, she brought the dish, but the cheese had been tossed on top without being melted. We asked for the manager.

Mark S.,"Tucson, AZ",180,502,33,4.0,7/5/2010,"We had been hesitant to venture over to the Cheesecake Factory because it just opened and we had been hearing about long waits. My wife suggested we go on the 4th of July for lunch. She is a genius! I always knew she was the brains in this outfit. The place was less than half full and we did not have to wait at all. We are seated at our table and given the 64 (OK, maybe more like 16) page menu. If you have never been to Cheesecake Factory, the menu is massive with lots of choices and I am not just talking about cheesecake. While we are reading the menu the server delivered a small basket of bread and butter. I always think this is a nice touch. We munch on the bread while we decide. After much perusal (I changed my mind three times because every time I turned the page I went ""Ooh, I want that"") and the return of the waitress, we order. We sit, chat, munch on bread and I applaud my wife for her genius decision to come for lunch on a holiday. The waitress returns and places the Grilled Chicken Club in front of my wife and the Cuban in front of me. Holy Cow! My wife's sandwich is about six inches high! My Cuban is nowhere near as large but still sizable. We dig into our food. My sandwich is very good with tender roasted pork, ham, pickles, mayo, mustard and Swiss cheese. It's a very good combination and I enjoy it. My wife struggles with her sandwich and finally decides to knife and fork it. She says it's very good but only finishes half. We did not try any of the cheesecakes. Service was very good. My wife dropped her napkin and just like that another one showed up without having to ask.

First off I love the cheesecake factory, it seems to be the place my large Hispanic family chooses to meet for birthdays,anniversaries, and celebrations. Tonight march 27th 2015 my dear nieces sweet 16th birthday my family came together to celebrate and hope to have a great meal, good company and relaxing environment. Cheesecake factory Tucson was far from that. First off, they would not seat us until 80% of our party was there actually we were just missing 5 people of our 20 (don't know how they figured their math). So we waited good company in tow guys outside ladies inside. As we watched groups being seated who walked in within 5 minutes we began to get restless. Finally our entire group showed up and then we received our buzzer wait for it.. One hour and a half wait. We arrived at 7 we were not seated until almost 9 o'clock. Finally the buzzer sounds and relief we are being seated.. So we thought we began to take our seats only to find out we are 5 seats short. Hot and tired of waiting we notice a extra booth available. Asking for this booth was like asking for there first born. Ok , we are sat water poured kids happy, things are OK now so we thought. I sat in the booth with my husband two boys and my mom so we ordered. My Dad sat at the main table and the waitress waited to put my mothers order in until all 20 orders were taken. Meanwhile my little family of four received our food. My husband and mother ordered the same dish being the man I love and adore my husband received his food and gave it over to my mother so she could eat. The waitress proceeded to point out to my mother I'm sorry ma'am that's his order!? Really um really he's a respectable man who handed it over to her SK she could eat first and our waitress tried to make my mom feel bad about that, tactless. An hour later good company not so good service we are finishing up same tactless waitress comes over to my 5'2 100lb mom and says how was your food? My mom proceeds to acknowledge the waitress by saying good thank you but before she could this inexperienced waitress says ""oh I can tell!"" Excuse me so rude where is your tact go back to etiquette school. Done so done reacpect is earned not given so done with cheesecake factory we spent well over $600 as a group and we were treated like it was our problem they cannot cater to a large group of people.

Chris F.,"Tucson, AZ",20,9,,3.0,1/26/2012,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night, and the same thought keeps running through my head, ""So this is what I could have been experiencing since 1996?"". I can't say I was disappointed, but I think I was underwhelmed by my meal. Upon arrival, we were seated right away, which was a big plus with a baby in tow. The waitress, Josie, was cheerful and attentive throughout the evening, and my Diet Coke was constantly full. No complaints there. The place was dimly lit and fairly loud. Again, not a real problem with a tired (screaming at times) baby. I could see it being a nice place for high school student on their way to homecoming. The menu...oh, the menu, where to begin? It's large. So, if you're looking for a place to feed people with differing tastes, you'll surely be able to please everyone. My problem was indecision. So, I end up reading the whole menu, and circling back to something I consider safe: burger and fries. The fries were, I must admit, standard yet tasty. Just the right amount of salt. The burger did not live up to the potential that bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce, and onion rings could deliver. Everything felt close to nice fast food than something costing more than twice as much. Don't get me wrong, this food wasn't about to make me sick, but it did make me long for the Vietnamese tacos sitting across the table from me. (and the crab cake sandwich I foolishly passed up) Still, I forged on. This was, after all, the factory of cake and cheese!! Dessert was not to be passed up. We went with the Key Lime Cheesecake. It came out looking wonderful. Soft whipped cream topped the plate in just the right proportion. But, when my fork hit the cake and it wobbled like rubber, I was shocked. The consistency of the cheesecake left a lot to be desired. The taste, however, was delightfully tangy and satisfying. In the end, I left full (stuffed even), but left confident that other options would not cause me to object to a return visit. However, I knew that I would not return for any of the things I'd just eaten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=160

So here's the deal. I had a slice of turtle cheesecake today at lunch (give me a break, I'm not drinking, I need another vice) and the entire time I was eating it, I kept thinking, this is SO different than I remember. It used to be a dark chocolate crumb crust with vanilla cheesecake swirled with caramel, topped with a hard chocolate ganache, sprinkled with pecans and drizzled with a caramel sauce. Good right? Well it's not the same. And apparently I already knew that because I wrote about in my first review. I have the worst memory.  So why am I giving them another star? For the same reason that we all hate chains, it's consistent. Today I had the usual- that darn luau salad that gets me every time!

The service at the bar was spot on, the speed and efficiency was superb, it was a great afternoon! I'm pissed that I ordered a cheesecake that apparently I didn't like in December, but such is life.

Ruben G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,62,206,1.0,8/9/2016,"I've been meaning to post this for a while...      Came here 4:00pm July 2nd on a Saturday and the place wasn't busy at all.  From the moment we walked in we were never greeted by the hostess. We stood in front of the counter and she never acknowledged us. After a while I finally asked ""Hi can I get a table for two?"".  It took 10 minutes for our waitress to finally come take our drink order. The atmosphere around us in the beginning was a ruckus due to a large family sitting directly across from us. After a while the family left and left a mess on the table, the seats even under the table. A while later the bus boy cleaned the table and didn't bother with the floor. A long while later our waitress arrives and introduces us to Caesar our waiter for the remainder of the evening due to a shift rotation, ok not a problem (but odd).    Finally a while longer and three bread trays later our food arrives. Our meals looked appetizing, they were nice and hot, so far so good, I ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken. I stir part of my food to incorporate the sauce into the rice, I'm in my third bite, I'm chewing and there's something stringy in my mouth I pull the string to discover a 4 inch piece of hair. Gross, I know. I stopped eating. Caesar arrives we told him about the hair, he  apologized said he'd bring a fresh plate. I asked him to take hubbys  plate as well and keep it warm. A few minutes later a manager (whose name I didn't get cause he wasn't wearing a name badge) came to our table to apologize for the hair in my food and the kitchen was preparing me a fresh plate. The manager noticed the table behind him (where the large family was) he squatted and saw the mess that was under the table then he left (I thought he was gonna have somebody come clean up that mess). A while later Caesar arrives with our food. They brought Hubby a freshly made meal as well, I thought that was really nice. On the surface mine looked just as good as the first until I stirred the food. They put so much sauce on my plate and very little rice, my rice was oozing with sauce and that sauce isn't spicy it is very very sweet, I couldn't eat it, it was discussing. We got the attention of a waiter that was by our table and asked him for more rice. He said he would and get out waiter over. Caesar arrived, we told him about the dish being too sweet, at that time the other waiter arrived with a bowl of rice. Caesar asked if everything was fine now that we had the bowl of rice or would I rather a fresh plate with new white rice and just have the chicken taken off the bad plate and placed on the new plate, I said ""Yes that'll be fine just don't put too much sauce over the chicken"". Caesar arrived for the third time with my plate and what a joke it was. What the kitchen staff did was they got a plate, took the extra rice that was in the bowl that the other waiter brought me and literally dumped the entire super sweet discussing chicken with rice and sauce over the white rice (no garnish, no effort). It looked like crap and that's putting it lightly. That was the last straw. I got upset told Caesar I was paying for any of this. We got up, walked towards the exit. As we got up to leave another family was being seated at the table with trash underneath (the manager never had somebody clean under the table).  As we walked towards the exit we saw the manager and told him what just took place and even brought it to his attention that he did nothing about the dirty table after he had noticed it. We straight up walked out of there after spending an entire hour there (still hungry). We will never go the Tucson Cheesecake Factory again and I don't recommend you do either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=40

Two marinated flattened, tender chicken breasts. Covered, covered in mushrooms and this lemon sauce. Served with a medium mound of Angel hair pasta. Really yummy! A lot of food. My wife had the Renee's Special, $11.50, described as one-half Chicken salad (or turkey) sandwich, a cup of soup, and a small green salad (or Caesar salad). These were the ""Lunch Specials."" It was a lot of food. As a matter of fact, what my wife received on her plate was a whole sandwich (two slices of bread with a generous amount of chicken salad), a *bowl* of soup (not a ""cup""), and a generous portion of salad. Before she took a bite, she called the waitress back to ask her if this was the lunch special because she did not want to pay for a full, regular meal. The waitress confirmed that it was a Renee's Lunch Special and that ""we like to stuff you here."" Uhm, yeah. The service was excellent. Checking on our progress and satisfaction without being intrusive or bothersome. I'm really impressed at how expensive the interior is from the marble tiling throughout to the heavy (but easily opened) doors and the massive hardware on them, to the decorations tastefully done on the walls and ceilings.

Tiffany S.,"Tucson, AZ",640,277,665,3.0,12/2/2014,"Cheesecake factory what can I say they have the absolute best cheesecake ever from the snickers to just their original and I really loved my red velvet cheesecake. .  As far as my meal went I had the Jamaican pepper sauce chicken and shrimp which consisted of the chicken and shrimp fried plantains, it  included some white rice with cilantro, black beans which were absolutely amazing and some very tasty mango salsa. I must say I was pleasantly surprised as many places try to make Jamaican food but they can't quite get it right this food was full of flavor it wasn't as spicy as I like but it still had a nice little kick to it. Now I would've given more stars such as four  maybe even five stars if our server would have been as good as the food, first off he was a little slow, I also had a mishap with my utensils being dirty there was something on it which I kindly asked if he could replace it and it took him a minute to do that also and we waited for several minutes just to get a refill on water and soda and when it came time to order dessert we told him right away we knew what we wanted but yet he still walked away then came back to place our order. Overall it wasn't a bad time I enjoyed my meal so that kind of made up a little for the lack in service so yes I would return again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=40
Jenny D.,"Tucson, AZ",9,71,45,3.0,8/25/2016,"Hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, and decided to go for lunch with some friends.  Goodness, I forgot how expensive this place was.  It seems innocent to start, until you get your bill and realize you spent nearly $50 for lunch.  Partly, this was my fault.  When ordering mojitos (if there isn't a price listed on the menu, and you don't ask when ordering, it's ones own fault for ordering an $11.25 drink), and cheesecake for take away, it will be more expensive than a regular lunch.   Hours listed on the door had 11a, they opened the doors at 11:05a.  Not a biggie.  Seated right away.  One person in our group was running late, informed the server as such.  After getting a drink order from her, it was difficult to catch her attention again to order when our buddy was going to be really late, and told us to go ahead and eat.  Turkey and avocado sandwich was decent, nothing extraordinary.  Sweet potato fries were good and way too much for several folks to eat.   The slice of caramel pecan turtle cheesecake was excellent, highlight of the meal.  Just not enough to justify the price of everything.  Maybe I'm getting stingy in my old age, but that was a lot of money for a decent lunch.  If I was getting a steak dinner with wine, this price point would be more appropriate.  (In my ""you kids get off my lawn"" and ""where's my damn discount"" sort of way)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=40

It's not too crowded or loud and I'm able to have a nice conversation with the staff and bartender without raising my voice.  I was served at the bar which I planned to go to have my drink and meal. The bartender made my usual, slightly dirty vodka martini, (much needed for a stressful day). The martini was perfect, not too dirty and not too overly strong. As for these entree I gave the Thai Glazed salmon a try. To my surprise is was pretty tasty. It was glazed with coconut and had a little spice added to it. Wish it could have been more spicy though like real Thai spices! But overall it wasn't too bad. For dessert I had the tiramisu. Which was perfect! Soft and sweet just the way I like it!

As long as they keep my new found favorites...miso Salmon and Javanese Salmon!

Miso Salmon reminds me  of like a teriyaki type salmon and JavaneseSalmon hasabomb pesto sauce and the fish is sooo soft and juicy! Go try it!

I've been to a ton of restaurants that have food items that they don't specialize in and they typically turn out pretty good.. For Cheesecake, it's basically everything on the menu besides the desserts. The dessert is fantastic but every single time, the actual food has just been totally underwhelming and over priced. I think this restaurant is almost stressing themselves out over the ridiculous sized menus that they offer. The ONLY reason of me ever coming back here has to be the Oreo or The Original Cheesecake.

The waiter for the evening was Eli and he was attentive as soon as we were seated. I must say it's great to sit out on the patio on a spring night. My sister started out with a  Calamari appetizer which she found tasty and good. Eli came back to check on how she liked the Calamari. The bread is good as it always is-(does everyone fill up on bread?) The food came by way of 4 servers--Wow feeling special-- IT is now quiet while everyone is busy eating. First review is the mashed potatoes which are rich and flavorful perhaps a little too much pepper. Next is the Fettuccine Alfredo my daughter said she liked it-it was creamy and rich. My sister had Chicken  Castaletta which is her usual order. The chicken was moist and the asparagus was large add the mashed potatoes for a big meal. Next came a mac and cheese burger she usually gets the  Louisiana Chicken Pasta so she stepped out of the box! She liked it as there isn't any burger left! Then there was Chicken Alfredo it to got a good review. Finishing was the Louisiana Chicken Pasta minus the mushrooms,peppers and onions they loved it! Eli was a great waiter so attentive ask for him if you come here.

I do have to say their menu is a little by overwhelming as the options are endless when it comes to meal choices. It is hard to decide what to eat when there's so many choices. Their bread is delicious though, they give you different kinds of breads for all your likings. The food itself (last time I had a chicken club sandwich) is I would say average.

A Thanksgiving with no dishes, sleeping late, and satisfaction from the ""wow"" factor all played into my decision. I ordered the night before, but still waited about 15 minutes for the cake which was, by the way, delicious. Be prepared for sticker shock, though. A 10"" will set you back $50. The cheesecakes are shipped frozen, and oddly pre-sliced with wax paper between each slice. Not that I would have tried to pass off the cake as homemade, but the stiff paper garnish sticking up not only threatens a paper cut, but also screams ""I am glopped out from a big metal robot machine in an uncaring, impersonal mass production facility.""

Andrew B.,"Wichita Falls, TX",138,156,36,3.0,1/4/2011,"I used to be a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory when I was in high school.  It was one of those places that you just had to go to -- kinda like Vegas when you're in college.  You feel almost empowered going, because it's cool and hip and everyone else does it.  Cramming a crowd of friends into a booth (or a two bedroom room in Vegas) is awesome when you're living it up under the artifice of luxury!  After having lunch there a couple days ago, though, I realized -- now?  Not so much. The food tastes fine, the menu covers just about everything, and I've had nothing but pleasant service, but everything from the pasta to the plaster on the walls is merely facsimile of what actually makes a restaurant great.  Massive plates of food, sky-high painted ceilings -- the vibe truly is Las Vegas lite.  The difference is, unlike Las Vegas where the facade of fanciness can be eschewed for actual quality and luxury, you're always stuck with something that is less than the genuine article at The Cheesecake Factory.  Eating here is like wearing a Faux-lex watch with pride. Still, it's a very pretty Faux-lex, and the people selling you the Faux-lex are very good at what they do, and I cannot fault anyone for being good at his or her job.  That said, if you've got more discerning tastes, there are definitely better places to spend your money.   Also, I make better cheesecake than they do :P",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=180

Kyle H.,"Tucson, AZ",1,5,,2.0,1/29/2012,"What an interesting place.... The menu is HUGE as is the footprint of the establishment. Honestly I feel like most people are in awe of the faux grandeur of the decor. Anyway on a very nice Saturday evening my girlfriend and I were sat within a minute of arriving. This always seems to be the case w/ TCF, which is a positive because at least you have your own space to wait long periods of time before you actually interact with someone that will take your drink order (then 10 minutes later your food order). The service just seemed to be slow and uncoordinated. Food wise: The size of the menu basically says 'we don't do anything really well but we'll make anything you want and do it adequately'. As always being the adventurous  one I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich w/ fries. The girlfriend ordered Mexican inspired fish tacos. Lets get down and dirty: the fries were pretty damn good, the sandwich was fair (for the price I expected it to be better than Chick-a-Fil, but it wasn't) and my soda was mixed very well. During the course of eating I asked my lady how she liked her tacos and asked her if they were better than Rubio's (the fast food joint) and surprisingly she said no.  Now I know I'm comparing fast food to a supposedly luxurious sit down establishment but my point is that when you don't specialize you fail. It's hard to do one thing beautifully let alone 60+ dishes. My take: this place is great for larger groups because the menu is large enough that anyone can find something they like on it. But if you're going with just one other individual be wise in your decision and be ready for an average meal at an extraordinary price.

Kenye N.,"Tucson, AZ",19,15,,2.0,9/15/2010,"Shame on you Tucson!  Shame on you for making this place the huge success it is.  You go to a restaurant that is named after the frozen, not made-in-house cheesecake they serve and their Chili's caliber of food!  All of this while places like Candela (now closed) and Chef Alishah's barely get any customers.   Now, I probably wouldn't have even bothered reviewing this place if I hadn't read the rather humorous five star review from a server there.  While I can sympathize with some of the things she's said (as I've worked in the restaurant industry) I think most of her complaints are totally unprovoked.  Reading through reviews I only found a couple of people who mentioned any problems with the staff.  The two or three times I've eaten there I've had quite lovely service.  And while she complains, even if she has most tables tip her 10% she still makes a killing.  By the way I'm not a skimpy tipper.  Not sure why I throw that in there, but I feel it's important. Now you're probably thinking I'm a big hypocrite for eating here three times, but I'll just say it was against my will.  See my Dad is one of those people that believes this along with P.F. Chang's are the best Tucson has to offer.  So when I get offered a free meal, I'm not going to turn it down. Now I'll admit it, of the three meals I've had there one was quite good, one was good, and only one was disappointing.  The Cajun Chicken ""Fritters"" (I think that's what they  were called) were quite good.  The burger I had there however was uber disappointing.  It didn't live up to their standards of ""huge portions"" and looked wimpy compared to other meals.  I was sad.  They don't do bad food, but in my opinion it's not even up to snuff with other chains like Olive Garden or Claimjumpers. The thing I find really silly is how people believe their cheesecake is the best on the planet.  Cheesecake is by far my favorite dessert, and I've had some phenomenal cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them.  I am also a cheesecake purist, meaning I think anything except plain cheesecake is sacrilege.  The fact they aren't made in house is the final nail in their coffin.  That being said, again they aren't terrible, but they don't deserve to have a restaurant named after them. A Yelp review isn't really necessary for this, as most of you aren't people who would frequent chain places, but I guess this will show up on Google too.  If you're a Tucsonian that has to support big business look into supporting Fox Concept restaurants.  You actually get great food there and you spend about the same amount!  I really wish more people would go out and support local businesses, that is where Tucson's real individuality shines.  Read through reviews here on Yelp, and you'll find more than a few gems!

My husband had the Blue Cheese Bacon burger - he really liked it but found that half way through the first half he had to use a fork/knife as it became too gooey.  This did not stop him or ruin his experience.  Nice fries were served with the burger in addition to the thick crispy bacon on the burger, toasted bun, thick tomato and about a 1/2 pound of meat!!!!  He cleaned the plate, so I guess he liked it.

When you got 10-18 people looking for a place to eat its amazing that this place is adaptable to accommodation. This time I had a great pasta that was properly oiled and graced with proportionate amounts of tomatoes, herbs, and feta cheese that was just a great meal.  We also had those fried zucchini sticks with the mozzarella atop. but it was obviously from a prepared and refrigerated mix, since it melted far to slow. Hand grinding is usually thinner imparts some warmth and melts faster. That's how i know. The drinks came out in good time, or waters were always filled, and the waitress was very nice even though we continue to invite our difficult friend. He makes for laughs and assures me that our hosts ""earn"" their keep. He's not mean, he is challenging.  Anyways while the huge menu, and service are very good there are things that keep the restaurant from reaching the top echelon. Perhaps a higher end selection or more paired items.

Kimberly S.,"Tucson, AZ",33,36,,2.0,3/15/2011,"My partner and I make it a point to avoid big chain restaurants but, I had been given a gift card for this restaurant.  So, we decided to use it one day while shopping at the mall. I won't lie, I LOVE cheesecake so that aspect excited me.  We were seated promptly and the wait staff was polite so that is where the two stars come from. The food: way too overpriced for the prepackaged, pre-prepared food that we ate.  I have had MRE's(Meal Ready To Eat, served to military personnel when cooks or food is unavailable)  that tasted better and hurt my stomach less.  I liked the fried mac n' cheese, but it was frozen and sent in a box.  I could get it at COSTCO cheaper.   The Cheesecake... Really?  This place is supposed to be known for and is named after CHEESECAKE!  I should be blown away by what hits my palate...  But, no.  Once again I could have gone to COSTCO and bought a frozen whole cheesecake for the same price and had it taste ten times better!   Horrible, horrible food all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=200
Brenda S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,1,3.0,10/10/2014,"We have been to cheesecake factories all over the US, but our experiences here have been just mediocre.  Normally when going to a Cheesecake Factory we get stellar service and food, but from the time we walked in, none of the four of us at our table felt special.  Very few smiles and very little welcoming.  We drove from SE Tucson, so from the start it was disappointing.  We sat in the bar and arrived on a weeknight for happy hour.  We all ordered drinks to start, but they took about 10 minutes to arrive.  There was only one bartender taking care of the entire restaurant.  Drinks were good.  I asked for ice water too, but never got it.  Thankfully hubby went to the bar to get me some.  Appetizers were great - avocado rolls, sliders, tamale cakes, and tuna tartare.  After the meal, we ordered a slice of cheesecake to go.  Got home and we were disappointed at the size of the slice.  They've gotten smaller over the years.  I'd eat here again but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to get there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=200

Roberta L.,"Tucson, AZ",14,72,,2.0,8/3/2010,"First time there. Menu is ridiculously extensive. I could have used 1/2 hour to really peruse it. Ordered one of the specials of the day: pecan crusted catfish with Pickapepper seasoning, succotash, smashed potatoes. Best was the succotash-very flavorful. The catfish was okay, nicely prepared but somewhat bland and the smashed potatoes were good enough. Portions were generous and I had no room for dessert (thank goodness). But the price was $17.00!!! I think that was way too much. The cheesecake sells for $7 or $8/piece. Best to share that a few ways if you are inclined to pay that much money. The cakes look great in the case, very tempting.

No seriously it has gotten that bad. Maybe a party of 15 with a mix of races is not appealing to the cheescake factory. Or they just are incapable of handling a large party but its dismal. I have had to have a manager come apologize for multiple mix ups, poor service, untimely delivery, and just outright bringing people the wrong food.  My last trip our server kept confusing the drink orders of people in our party. When she was told she was wrong she got defensive and said some fairly offensive comments to guest with me.

Yvett R.,"Portland, OR",267,473,170,3.0,3/18/2012,"First off, don't judge me for going to a chain. We were on that side of town, we'd never been to ANY Cheesecake Factory and figured it wouldn't hurt.  I don't know if the decor is the same at each location (like Olive Garden), so I have to admit that it's certainly pretty. I also really like a place that has their staff wear bright white. White = clean in my mind, so that's always a plus. We went on a busy Friday evening but it look less than 10 minutes to be seated. In that short while, we were offered a seat at the bar so that we wouldn't have to wait at all.  The service was fast and friendly. I have to admit that I was overwhelmed by their menu. Our go-to restaurants have a one page menu (food in the front, drinks in the back), so a 21 page menu can be a lot to process. I ordered a Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries, my husband had a beet & goat cheese salad and a flatbread of some kind. The food was out pretty quickly and it was just ""eh"". It wasn't terrible, it wasn't fantastic, it was just adequate. Nothing memorable. Nothing I'm going to be craving. Nothing I'm going to tripping over to try again soon. Eh. My husband was disappointed that the beets weren't fresh. I only ate about a quarter of my sandwich and had the rest boxed up.  Of course we tried the cheesecake. We had a Hershey's one to share. Again, it was good but not the best cheesecake I've had in my life. I was a bit sad about that because I was somehow expecting a spectacular cheesecake. It was sweet and rich and chocolaty but again, not something I can't live without.  I'd give a glowing review for the staff and waiter and an ""eh"" review for the food. I'd go again if I was meeting someone there, but I don't think I'd suggest this as a place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=200

William P.,"Tucson, AZ",3,29,,4.0,9/15/2010,"I like CF, it's a fun place to take someone for a birthday or celebration even in a small group. I have gluten, egg, and milk allergies so the few times I have been here I threw health to the wind just so I could enjoy myself. Also, this place is a chain, so you can only expect so much. I don't walk into Friday's, Red Robin, Chili's, or Applebee's expecting very much. For being a huge chain the Cheesecake Factory isn't bad at all, and the servers have always been attentive & helpful. You get a lot of food and it is somewhat pricey, but I always walk out with another meal's worth of food in to-go boxes. Plus, they do small plates or snack-sized portions so it's up to the customer to control how much they pay or eat. I wouldn't bother with mixed drinks, alcohol, or anything of the sort. They are fun to try but you will be getting marked up quite a bit, obviously, so you're better off sticking to the usual tea, lemonade, water, soda, domestic beers, etc. I had the Flying Gorilla one time, was good, and the sangria, not too shabby. Appetizer: So freakin' good. I ordered these as my meal the next time I went to the Factory! The dipping sauce is sweet but tangy, yum. Main dish: Chicken Piccata. Pretty good for what it was, I like more lemony & caper tastes with mine, but I can understand them toning it down a bit for the ""masses."" Dessert: The Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake is worth it. Next time I want to get myself sick I will be going to Cheesecake Factory for this and only this. Their cheesecake is frozen, big surprise, and the consistency does suffer a bit. But it's still edible and very delicious! Both visits so far were during off-peak times, so there was no wait for a table. I think one was really really late on a Sunday night (we were some of the last people to leave before close), and the other was a Wednesday night around 4pm (the restaurant filled up a bit after we ordered our food). Like other reviewers have said, this place is not for the light eater or the sensible eater.

Liz D.,"Saint Johns, FL",11,486,,3.0,5/5/2010,"I met up with some friends two days ago after I'd already eaten dinner a couple of hours beforehand. I wasn't hungry, but that doesn't mean that the smells of the food being eaten near me and the size of their menu didn't make me wonder if I couldn't just squeeze in a few more calories. So, we did. My boyfriend and I shared a nachos appetizer because I let him pick and he's not adventurous. So, nachos it was. Our friend's had already started with drinks before we got there and raved about the place to us (we'd never been there). They ordered a chicken pasta and turkey sandwich which came with fries. This was an adventure of itself as the last time they were there, my friend's dad was there and ordered this specific sandwich. Out of laziness or really believing this was a rare delicacy only thought up and asked for by his father, my friend called his dad on behalf of his girlfriend (my friend) to find out what was on that sandwich. Turns out it was just a club.  Anyways, the food took awhile (they were busy as it was 7pm on a Saturday), but the drinks stayed full by our waitress who kept stopping by to check on us. The food came and their's looked really good, the few fries I was forced to eat by my friend who couldn't help but share were really good. Our nachos? Eh. I've had better at an Applebees or even Taco Bell, but it did look fancy. I picked everything off of the few that I ate and just nibbled the overly salted chips. For nearly $10, I would have expected better. And with a menu as long as their's I'm sure that won't be a problem next time.  When we were all done, the waitress stopped by and shoved what looked like a dessert menu in my hand. No one else, just me. I thought was not only strange, but rude as I was in the middle of telling a story when she stopped by and hadn't even realized what happened until I looked down and had to tell her No Thanks. Just a little creepy. The person who said this place is loud was dead on. Our friend kept yelling everything he was saying which would have seemed a little rude, but this place is pretty noisy.

Joe K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,5,5.0,12/28/2012,"Wow!  Tonight the food was really exceptional!  I have been here several times over the past few years and most of the time it is a 3.5 to 4, not bad, but not over the top either. But I am really happy to say tonight they really did a fantastic job not only on my meal, but my wife, mother and kids meals. I had to first off assess if it was perception because I was hungry or was it the food and service that were really good, I wasn't starving or anything, but was looking forward to a good meal with the family. First off, I think this is the first time I have tried the Clam Chowder they serve on Friday's.  I consider myself pretty much a snob in the area of New England Clam chowder and have had some of the best over on the coast in New England's land of seafood.  This was really outstanding.  It had the right balance of potatoes, cream, butter and very good tasting clams.  I tend to really rate a chowder by it having a lot of clams, and this has a lot.  It was just wonderful. I did ask if it was made there and was told they do make it fresh. The only item for improvement was I like a few crackers, either oyster or even some regular square, but they don't have any, and even the waiter said he didn't understand it either, but he brought some more bread and all was well.  Still invest in a few crackers, sounded like others are asking for them as well. Next was the Classic Burger I ordered.  I am very picky about getting medium or medium rare with my beef, and this was perfect.  Warm pink center, and light and crispy on the outside, and very juicy inside, but not elbow drenching over the top juiciness. It was solid, beefy and the bread was toasted and the red onion patty was grilled just right.  Whoever was working the grill did an outstanding job.  They call it a chophouse burger, so I assume this means a chopped steak like sirloin or something. The secret to a juicy burger is using fatty burger or ground steak, and this was it.  It was really great, and it came along with a herb mayonnaise sauce that was really tasty. Everyone at the table had a small wedge of it and all said superb. It was arguably the best burger I have had in a long time. I think the one that comes close to it is Zinburger over on East River Road, great burger there too. Only improvement is choice of potatoes, it would be a nice menu add if they do a nice crispy baked potato, but they only offer mashed and fries, but that isn't why I ordered the burger.  The burger stood on its own very well. Lastly, we ordered cheese cake, and this is the first time I have ordered the Fresh Banana Cheesecake, it was simply wonderful.  I have an affection for cream and bananas, so I am biased in this area, but this was well balanced, well chilled cheesecake and the bananas were clearly fresh.  All blended and tasted smooth and complementary. Lastly was the service, we had several people bring food and asking if we needed things, and they followed up correctly.  The main waitress was Alina.  She was engaging, helpful, full of energy and made sure our drinks were kept full and knowledgeable when I asked questions about the food.  Great service.  I also liked the fact that they brought the various courses are the right times and we weren't rushed with the main course coming when we were only half way through the first soups and salads.   Definitely going back.  BTW, this was a Friday evening, so I am wondering if they don't staff all areas with the more veteran and seasoned staff, but I know I haven't always been there on a busy Friday evening.   My families meals of spaghetti, and broccolini pasta and sausage meals were really great too, everyone was very happy when we left with out meals and doggy bags! Final thing, it would be nice if you had wifi, there was conversation going on and we all wanted to check something online to add to our conversation, but nothing.  or get a cell booster installed, because you can't get a cell signal in there at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=240

Caron M.,"Tucson, AZ",13,37,28,1.0,6/28/2010,"After a long day shopping, a friend and I ventured into the newly opened location at Tucson Mall for an early dinner. I'd heard the restaurant served one variety of gluten-free cheesecake, so although no gluten-free menu was posted on their website we ventured in. We didn't have to wait long for a table, and once we can down, I explained that I have Celiac and therefore couldn't eat anything with gluten. The waitress was very nice and said they while they have no printed gluten-free menu, she would check with the chef about safe choices for me. She came back a few minutes later and said I couldn't eat anything on the regular menu (one item on the specials would be ok with a few changes) but they could cook me a piece of chicken breast and some steamed vegetables. Not quite what I have in mind when I go out to eat, so we skipped straight to dessert. I asked about the gluten-free cheesecake and she said it was the Godiva chocolate one. The cheesecake isn't made at the restaurant (its made daily in a factory and trucked in) so I didn't need to worry about cross contamination in their kitchen. The plates of cheesecake arrived quickly and we dug in. It was ok - very rich and heavy, but extremely one-note (to me, good cheesecake in New York style - a complex slightly sour flavor). But about ten minutes later, my stomach was in pain - definitely a reaction to gluten that lasted the rest of the weekend. I don't know if they used a knife to cut my slice that was contaminated from cutting another type of cheesecake, or if the factory was the source of the contamination, or if the cheesecake, while flourless, wasn't actually gluten free, but I sure won't be doing that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tucson?start=240
