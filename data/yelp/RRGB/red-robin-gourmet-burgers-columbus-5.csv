Jessica H.,"Lancaster, OH",13,31,12,4.0,1/5/2018,"I ate here over Labor Day weekend 2017 and I was not disappointed. I ordered one of the $6.99 cheeseburgers with bottomless fries and it was so good! The value can't be matched, especially at Easton. My husband ordered the same thing and we both ordered a soda; the bill before tip was $20--very reasonable.  In case anyone is wondering the $6.99 cheeseburger is as good as the $12 one, but just slightly smaller. It filled me up, but it also filled my husband up. We did not order a second serving of fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Heather S.,"Columbus, OH",49,191,59,2.0,12/28/2017,"I've recently been to this particular location twice in the last year which is more than I had been the previous 6 years. Both times the food has been so so. It's really not that good and it's not just me. I've tried different items both times and the same goes for my husband. I know it's a cheap eats, but I don't think it is worth it.  Also, both times at this location has been terrible service. I mean terrible. Like we had to ask for refills, ask for silverware, ask for the bill, ask for the bill to be corrected (multiple times)... it has been a fiasco both times. The group we were with most recently frequents this spot and we asked that we start meeting somewhere else in the future cause it's not worth the hassle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Matt P.,"Columbus, OH",54,205,497,2.0,11/12/2017,"Not a place for someone who loves burgers and brews, ironically. Thus, don't let ""Gourmet Burgers and Brews"" lead you on. Granted, they don't say ""craft brew,"" but what they have on draft is what every other dive bar has. The ONLY thing that sounded decent was a Bell's Brewery Two Hearted Ale, which was not on their board of brews (don't know why.) Thank goodness I asked the server (with fingers crossed) if there was anything else on tap other than what was on the board....(oh, and ask for a pint, because they'll give you a ""giant"" as default, apparently.) Speaking of, the server was nice, but it took five minutes to see a living soul and get seated for lunch at 11:30 on a Friday in an empty restaurant. No hostess at the front.... For a ""gourmet burger"" establishment, they can't cook a burger with pink. All around the table we order five burgers, pink in the middle/medium rare--delivered all well done. A $12 price tag REALLY stings in a place like this, no matter how many free steak fries they deliver to your table. In an area with other restaurants that specialize in the same and do SUCH a great job at it, I'm not sure how this place stays open. They're good for lunch groups and have milkshakes. Maybe that's it....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Liz A.,"Columbus, OH",52,41,24,2.0,9/30/2017,"The highlight was the food,  The low point was the service - or lack thereof. My hubby got a burger.  It was good but smaller than before.  It was also a good thing he ordered more fries as soon as our food arrived as we didn't see our waitress again or very often for a LONG TIME.  I sat with an empty glass the entire time we waited for our food. She never checked with us so I could get a refill. My salad was OK.  It came with garlic toast which was a joke - 2 little pieces of thin toast, smaller than saltines.  Pathetic. It took forever for us to flag down our waitress so we could pay and leave.  And the restaurant was by NO MEANS busy.  We were seated a few minutes before 5 pm. I will hesitate before returning to this location - which is a shame.  It's very close to home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5

Addison O.,"Westerville, OH",2,11,,1.0,1/7/2018,"We have been going to this location for 7+ years and today will be our last. It used to be clean with great food and friendly service. Now it's dirty, food is mediocre and you're lucky if you get a ""hi"" when you walk in the door. My husband and i used to LOVE going there and always felt we got our money's worth. We used to get the onion ring tower which was huge and now it's half the size. I always get the Avo-Cobb-O salad and today the avocado wasn't even on it. We told our waiter who then had his manager take half off the price which was nice. The second to last time we were in...we left after waiting 30mins. Reason for that being the hostesses looked/acted like they could've given two flips wether we got seated or not. There were empty table just sitting with food on them and no one did anything about it.  One hostess even was laying her head down on the podium! Today when we were seated there was a dirty knife and food still under our table. Then during our whole meal we got to stare at food and trash under tables. And people were sat at them!! With out them being cleaned!! The bathrooms are a disaster. The women's handicap stale door is hanging on by a thread and my husband said the men's wasn't any better. When we left, what I'm assuming was the manager as he had on a dress shirt, didn't even look up from the podium to say goodbye to us.  I hope this location gets its act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Alix V.,"Columbus, OH",38,78,1,3.0,10/16/2017,"I went to this location last night (Sunday evening) around 6:30pm. I enjoy Red Robbin because of their wonderful gluten free options so I was excited to try out the RR at Easton. It fell short. First of all, there was a 15 minute wait when there were several open tables. The service was also lackluster. It wasn't necessarily bad, per se, it just wasn't up to par with the amount of guests in the restaurant. Our server greeted us and brought our drinks, but only checked on our table once. Three other servers waited on us: one for a second round of drinks, one for our meal, and one for a round of French fries. The initial server only greeted us and brought us our check.  He didn't check on us during our meal at all. He also said, as he gave us our check, ""If you want me to keep my job, give me a 10/10."" My father-in-law wasn't impressed. My FIL stated, ""it was hard for me to even tip 15%."" I felt that was odd, considering our server didn't even attempt to go out of his way to be friendly to us.  The reason I'm giving Red Robbin at Easton 3 stars is because their food was absolutely delicious! My fries were hot and fresh. My grilled chicken sandwich was one of the best I've ever had and their gluten free bun is to die for! I will always be a patron at RR because, even if their service is in decline, their food is worth it! I'll eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5

Tanisha S.,"Columbus, OH",113,70,273,5.0,1/7/2017,"I've eaten here many times before but Red Robin is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  I'm officially back on my low carb lifestyle and have been reduced to Phase 1 eating of straight protein and limited veggies. Eating out is a challenge and I have to ask the staff a million questions just to be sure I'm eating prop foods with no sneaky ingredients. They were all so patient, attentive, and pleasant!  It was busy my last visit but we were seated immediately in the bar area where there was full service from the wait staff. My waitress was new, day 4 of training; she did a great job with help from a senior waitress. They seldom came together but we're in tune and regularly replaced our drinks without asking (I had iced tea w/sugar free syrup from the bar). They gave suggestions on food and alternate options, given my diet. I had the bunless Wedgie burger with guacamole, onions, added pepper jack cheese, and it was wrapped with darn near a full head of iceberg lettuce. I was craving the bottomless fries (no can do) but was informed the salad and a few other sides are also bottomless...and I took my last serving as left overs. My tea was bottomless as well.  I walked out feeling satisfied for the first time in a week and since it was my birthday month and I'm part of their club I got my meal for free. They gave me a small cup of whipped cream for desert  Yep, 20 pounds to lose so guess where I'll be eating...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Kristy G.,"Howell, MI",53,2,,1.0,9/19/2017,"The service was unbelievably horrible! We walked in and requested a table and the hostess acted confused and took awhile to finally figure out where to sit us, the place was pretty empty. Then our waitress rudely asked if we were ready to order and she snapped back saying ""are you ready to order"", we said no but wanted to put kids orders in and she had abruptly walked away before taking the kids orders. The entire time we felt like we were an inconvenience to her. We then listened to her yell into the kitchen about another order, requesting crisper fries for the table sitting right next to us , demanding better fries. All seemed very unprofessional to do in front of customers. Overall I felt a lack of professionalism and will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Dave J.,"Columbus, OH",10,18,2,1.0,2/12/2017,"Terrible service and terrible staff working the phone. While we did order an order to go, the $43 ticket was filled out properly, but the inability to read the ticket by the staff led to half of our order being unable to be consumed do to a food intolerance issue. There were other more minor gross issues, but the problem came when we called the location for resolution.  Calling in, we spoke to a young girl who refused to let us speak to a manager regarding the food we received being wrong/ not as ordered. The person refused to listen to us and said they did not want to hear about the issues we had and hung up the phone. So it being a weekend, I have called to leave a messaged for MaryEllen at the corporate office 1-877-733-6543 option 9. I really hope to hear back as this was a place I and my immediate and extended family have gone for birthdays in the past. I don't show up with coupons (even though my email is full of offers) and I tip my servers no less than 20-25%. At this point I don't believe Red Robin cares about the quality and accuracy of what they serve. Just the numbers that come through the door. I can get less expensive crap from Wendy's or the McDonald's, even the Roadhouse next door to this place. I don't like giving bad reviews, as there is never a 100% perfect service over a long enough timeline. But seeing as how this was handled with the restaurant with no one raising their voice or getting mad. At this point I am severely disappointed with the response and find it odd that companies are willing to throw away business and word of mouth recommendations over $20 in food they failed to prepare properly. In a city like this, there are more options people have to go to and places willing to take feedback.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Emma O.,"Columbus, OH",9,84,4,2.0,3/11/2017,"I ventured back here, after management was kind enough to reach out to me after my last visit. At first, everything was all good! We were seated promptly even though the restaurant was busy, and our server Cameron was very polite and friendly. We ordered onion rings as appetizers and some drinks...and that's when the trouble began. Our onion rings and drinks were out quickly..but we took one look at the plates they were on and balked. The serving sides was covered in a layer of grease almost as if they had been wiped off and not actually washed. And the back of the one of the plates had a giant blob of ketchup on it. Mind you, there was no ketchup on the table in bottle or blob form. It definately was a remnant on the plate.This was only noticed after my boyfriend had stuck his fingers in it. I hate being critical after a restaurant has taken the time to reach out to me. I really wanted to like this place and give it another go, especially after the manegment tried to make my last visit right, but after the previous experience and the plates, I couldn't bring myself to stay any longer. Once again (for the last time)I left red robin hungry and dissapointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Keith L.,"Westerville, OH",50,1,,2.0,2/5/2017,"Generally, Red Robin is one of my favorite family dinners locations.  The one at Easton Town center was pretty awful.  The waitress was very pleasant with everything, but wasn't very attentive.  The major issue appears to be the kitchen.  One meal (chicken fingers) came out after everyone else was finished with their food and it was cold.  Maybe it was left on the serving line for that long, but it didn't seem so.  When it was brought to the managers attention, her attitude was apathetic.  She did bring out fresh food and it was hot the second time.  I always get sweet potatoes fries with my meal and the ones that come with my meal were barely warm, but the refill was hot. Overall the experience was pretty bad.  We were there for over three hours and that wasn't because we were just hanging out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Alex D.,"Columbus, OH",54,49,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Management must train the staff to not refill fries more than once. Burger was cool, spent the extra buck to get garlic fries, and was offered a refill once. After that we were quickly given the check and avoided for the rest of the night. I wanted to get a refill one more time before we left so I waved at the waitress. She looked at me, made eye contact, and then just walked past me without acknowledging me. I've never been straight up ignored by a waitress before and I even gave her a heads up that I was going to eat more fries when she delivered the bill. What bothered me most was the waitress straight up ignoring us after dropping off the bill so soon. That's not a way to train staff and we won't be back at this location. I can go to a nicer restaurant to get a better burger for over $10 that at least won't lie to me about ""bottomless fries"" to justify the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5
Jon C.,"Parkersburg, WV",28,27,5,5.0,3/22/2017,"Recently I ate here as a back up as all of the restaurants at Easton Town Center had long waits. I had only been to a Red Robin once before, about 6 years ago, and was not a fan. However, things have changed in a great way.  Our service was top notch, and they seated us right away.  I had the southern charm burger with onion rings. It was amazing. It was very well seasoned, cooked exactly how I ordered, and the glaze set it over the top.  Everything is very well priced.

Doc M.,"Columbus, OH",288,193,378,3.0,10/6/2016,"I love good burgers and yes, the Red Robin chain has been on my 'to try' list for years. So, recently after listening to the RR episode of the Podcast 'Doughboys', I finally made a trip to the nearby Easton location for lunchables with my Bro. This place sits to the entrance to the Easton Market shopping plaza with parking in the rear. I can't tell you much about the interior since we chose to score a patio table on this perfect Ohio Fall day. Our server was quick to get our drink order and give us time to read through the huge catalog of a menu they have here (The weight of the menu in Burger terms = about Wendy's Baconator Triple). Outside of their main draw, the burgers, they offer a wide array of menu choices, and while that can be either a good or bad thing, I decide to play it safe and go with the one thing they advertise to be. My choice, the Royal Red Robin, a bacon cheeseburger with a perfectly cooked fried egg on top, my favourite combination wherever I can find it and this burger did not disappoint. Paired it up with the 'bottomless' Garlic herb fries, which were the house steak fries tossed in a garlic oil with herbs and Parmesan cheese. Truly a garlic lovers treat but, one serving was enough for my bottom and I spent the rest of the day with garlic on my 'flavour saver' 'stache.   For a First time visit to this chain this location scored a Win for their Team and I'll be back for another round...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5

Jackie E.,"Columbus, OH",10,43,9,2.0,9/7/2016,"I went with a friend on a Friday night around 730. We saw lots of people milling about outside and inside and I figured everyone was waiting for a seat but when we went in to check, we were seated immediately. I had a simple burger with lettuce, tomato and cheese cooked with a little bit of pink. My friend had a beer. The burgers here are pretty good for a big chain. They will definitely satisfy a burger craving. AND you get bottomless fries which is kind of unique. The steak style fries are actually pretty good too. I like them.  What I did not like was all of the yelling at the customers that happens there because of the horrible layout of this place. If they seat you in the center of the restaurant where all of the 2 people booths are and towards the back near the kitchen, then you will have to walk all of the way to the front of the restaurant, then all of the way to a back corner to use the restroom.  The booths near the kitchen are right next to the bathroom. Instinct tells you to cut through the waitstaff area to get to the toilet which is super close. You are not allowed to do this. There are signs saying do not enter and if you do (and it takes about 5 steps to do so), you will get yelled at. Later, as we were leaving, they had blocked off the center aisle that led straight to the exit. I have no idea why, but when we tried to leave, we got yelled at and told to take a detour to the side of the restaurant, then to the front. Before leaving, you can hear waitstaff yelling at customers who were trying to go the bathroom or trying to leave. The wait staff seemed to spend more time yelling at people than filling drinks or french fries. There are better burgers out there, but you probably won't find bottomless fries.  I'd go again if you were buying and driving. And we didn't sit in the middle aisle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5

Grace M.,"Columbus, OH",28,184,7,4.0,6/7/2016,"Not sure why I enjoy Red Robin so much. Probably because I have found the food consistent, the atmosphere casual and the menu appealing to many. All an all an easy choice when you need one.  One menue item often mentioned are the fries, garlic, sweet potato and steak cut, which are bottomless and served hot as you request more. I believeyou can also get bottomless broccoli if that is more your styl. But their Red Robin seasoning (avaliable for sale at the bar) is just too yummy with its unhealthy salty, sugaryness. Oh and be sure to look into the dipping sauces. During our most recent visit, our server suggested the bacon aoli and I think my brother fell in love. And now I must admit that I am lame and always order their bruschetta chicken sandwich. But hey I have enjoyed it each and every time so that says something for itself.  Based on location etc. there will be days you'll find the wait to be seated varies from none to 30min+, and the dinning areas can be quiet to humming rather loudly. They also have those new fangled table top computers that allow you to page your server and pay/leave when you wish, but our servers have by and by been on the ball.

I recently tried the wedgie burger since im trying to get back in shape a little. Its lettuce wrapped in place of a bun. I have to admit...It might be my new favorite. The lettuce added a while new taste and texture to the sandwich. And the bun wasnt missed AT ALL!! My main gripe with Red Robin is that the changed the decor of the locations.

On a busy Friday evening we were seated in probably fifteen to twenty minutes. Again not bad for a Friday night. It looked like they could probably use a couple more servers throughout the restaurant because our server who did well, was really busy with a lot of tables. We ordered chips, salsa,  & guacamole as our appetizer, which in my opinion took over 15 minutes to come out, which is a little long for a no cook appetizer.  I ordered my Red Robin standby, The Royal Red Robin. The burger as usual was excellent. My pet peeve about Red Robin recently is it seems they are getting stingy with the fries. The burgers are served with a side of like 8 to 10 fries. I have those finished off in less than a minute. Our sever was on top of getting us refills, although the refills took a little long to come out. I also ordered the endless Root Beer Float, which was excellent, but endless means endless.

Not a single offer to make it up through a discount, coupon, etc....just a sorry- it's summer and humid. Like the schmucks we are we paid the bill in full and didn't complain. The service is generally slow but the ability to pay using the tabletop kiosk is awesome! One of the reasons that I go back. My kids love it so I took them to this location after their hockey practices. We waited for about 10 minutes to be seen by a waitress. She was very pleasant and took our entire order at once, which was helpful. I received my drink immediately but it took about 10 more minutes for my kids to get theirs. The food came out at a decent time but it was wrong. My youngest' order was not right and when I mentioned it to the server she seemed surprised. The order, kids pizza, did come out but it was nothing more than garlic bread-burnt garlic bread- with cheese. The server was apologetic and did bring out fries so he could eat before the pizza came but it's one too many times. I won't be back to this location.

This time round, my niece picked this restaurant for her birthday dinner with the family. We decided to meet at 5:30, thus we're seated right away. The waitress was polite.  This time round, I decided on the Bonsai Burger. Regular classic cheeseburger, except a teriyaki sauce and a slice of pineapple top it off. A side of sweet potato fries to accompany. Results? Thought the burger (meat) was nicely grilled - slightly pink throughout the center, and juicy. The downside was too much teriyaki sauce. It almost totally masked the flavor of the burger. And the sweet potato fries? Well, I LOVE sweet potatoes, thus any place that serves good, quality SPF has my heart... And this places sticks were NOT good :( a large amount of the fries were outside slices. Way over cooked, too. Couldn't taste sweet potato at all.

We've been coming here for over 3 years, and the food is always great and 95% of the time, we've had great service. I like the new decor, the old was very tacky. I do wish that servers would be careful not to sit people who do not have children, next to those who do. It's honestly the reason I don't go there more often. There's always a chance you'll be seated by screaming children. I like being able to customize everything, and the bottomless fries are great because if someone's still hungry, that's easily fixed without having to spend more money.

When my husband told him he didn't provide us with good service , it went to a whole new level.. he then kept coming to our table.. telling us he's been doing this for 23 years. my husband finally got mad and told him it was over to move on. He then offered to buy our dinner. We declined his offer and again asked him to please forget it and to move on. He then asked us ""Do you fucking look down on me cause I'm a server?"" Holy shit!! this guy has major issues. He then cleaned off a knife while at our table and gestured as if he was going to use it. My husband then asked for the manager. I'm not sure what the outcome of this will be, but he shouldn't ever serve another customer. He needs mental help. BTW his name was Jim. please if you visit this restaurant don't let Jim know he's not a great waiter. He might threaten you as well!!!

My entire expereince at the Easton Red Robin was a complete 180 from how I remember the place.  Our server (who also was a bartender I think) reached a new level of annoying.  I think he was trying to work on creating a cute catch phrase... or maybe his boss told him he needed to be more outgoing.. either way.. it was so over the top that I had to try my best not even make eye contact.  My favorite was his excited 'Soups On!' comment when bringing out our burgers.  We did not order soup and it was said exaggerated that it wasn't even funny. Our meal:  Fries - Since Red Robin is known for their fries as well their burgers and who can resist Sweet Potato Fries we both ordered the upgrade.  Both of were in a bit of shock when they came out.  They were cute about the size of McDonald's fries and burnt nearly to a crisp.  No flavor at all.  We were shocked that someone could even serve such bad looking fries.  When the server came back and asked if we wanted more of them (we each barely could touch them) I mentioned that they were burned and not good - he seemed shocked that we would not like them. Burgers - I ordered the Blue Ribbon burger and my wife had bacon cheese burger.  We both wanted to order medium rare but we were told the kitchen could not do that for us.  We both ordered Medium and were given close to well done.  Meat was dry and flavorless.  Mine had onion straws on the bottom of it - at least I think that was what was supposed to be there.. it looked and tastes more like the left over bits of batter after the onion rings were made.  Blue cheese had no flavor either.  My wife's burger same exepreince - over cooked with no flavor.  I remember Red Robin having incredibly juicy, tasty burgers. Overall - this place really has taken a turn for the worse.  When we ate it was 4:30 pm.  There may have been 3 other tables filled.. there was no rush.. no excuse for such a poor quality food.. or such a socially awkward server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=60

Jeffrey H.,"Centerburg, OH",0,4,,1.0,3/15/2016,"Aweful dining experience.  Service was terrible, food was just as bad.  First we were sat in the back of the restaurant with  about five or six other tables all next to each other.  The rest of dining room was near empty.  All these tables were being covered by one server.  Other servers were seen just standing around or wiping an occasional table.  We had an appetizer and a so called bowl of chili.  The chili portion would not fill a cup let alone a bowl.  Then our main courses came,  both portion sizes were easily rivaled by a McDonald's happy meal.  The ""bottomless fries"" did not matter because the server never returned and offered to get us more.  We were completely done with our meals before he ever came back.  At one point he took my glass of tea to refill and after 15 minutes I had to ask if he could bring it back.  My wife's meal sat getting cold because they had brought the wrong dipping sauce with it and she was waiting to have it corrected.  The last time for this place.  If I could give it zero stars I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=60
Traveling Food Critics W.,"Canal Winchester, OH",3,48,2,3.0,1/29/2014,"We love Red Robin's, but not this location. First, the service was sub-par.  It may have been the guy's first week or something...but he forgot stuff constantly and was very slow.  When the food finally did arrive (after nearly 45 minutes) it was inconsistent.  Both burgers were ordered the same temperature, but one came out heavily brown on the inside and the other came out looking like it had only stopped mooing minutes prior.  The manager walked around and really did nothing to help anyone.  The most positive part of the night was the tower of onion rings which are to die for!  Red Robin's makes them the best!  Overall though, just a very average, albeit slow experience.  It's not one that would make us consider this place as a ""must patronize"" or ""top of the list"" candidate",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=60
Simone D.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,55,12,2.0,6/26/2011,"This experience was definitely disappointing to say the least. Once again, thought this would be a casual, kid-friendly joint so I wanted to give it a go. First tip-off, there weren't any hosts readily available to put my name in on the wait list. I should learn first red flag means bail. The decor however is awesome. I love the set-up and love the mini arcade they have to occupy your time before or after dinner.  The freckled lemonade tastes awesome and it includes bottomless refills which is a good thing considering it's quite pricey for a non-alcoholic beverage. The menu has a lot of options, it took me a awhile to decide on something. I wanted to try a lot of things. My server was quite accommodating when it came to fulfilling my requests of how I wanted my order. However, I asked for my son's mac & cheese to come out with our appetizers. The apps came but the mac didn't. The waitress said she'd check on it but I didn't see her again until after my food had arrived, still no sign of the mac. By this time my son had filled up on my entree and apps. When we were almost finished she came out with the mac. I told her we didn't want it. Then the manager came over and took care of things but then the server disappeared. From there the manager became our server. So that definitely bothered me. All in all I think the food is great, the selection on the menu is more than I expected and the decor is perfect to keep your child entertained until the food arrives. This particular Red Robin though hasn't quite aced the customer service aspect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=80
Dennis L.,"Columbus, OH",29,184,,4.0,4/19/2011,"I avoid Red Robin for several reasons:  1) It's a chain.  2) It's always crowded.  3) It attracts children.  4) Creepy, tights-wearing mascot. Despite those reasons, I get irresistible cravings for Red Robin sometimes... not for the burgers, which I haven't tasted in years, but for the ""fish burger,"" which is really just a fish filet sandwich.  In fact, it's got two delicious, crispy breaded fish filets, a bunch of pickles, a succulent dilly tartar sauce, and shredded cabbage.  It's by far the best fish sandwich in town.   The trademark seasoned steak fries are quite good as well, and ketchup lovers like me will appreciate the multiple ounces of ketchup you can scoop up with each one.  It's nice that they refill your fries for free, but I've never been able to take advantage of it because I'm always full. They've got some tasty N/A mixed drinks here, like a lime/raspberry thing served in a ridiculous glass that cost like $5 but I had to have it anyway.  At least it had free refills... I've never seen any sort of drink like this with free refills anywhere else.  Speaking of drinks, I like that they have a full bar here.  I rarely get alcohol at restaurants, though having a bar at a family-friendly place like this is, I think, a nod to parents that they're allowed to have a little fun, too, when they take their kids out to supper.   That said, last time I ate at this location, there were four men at a nearby table, talking loudly about subjects that should not be talked about in a family restaurant.  They were so loud that we asked to change tables, and our waitress apologized, comped some of our food, and explained the men had been there drinking all day long.  How pathetic is that?  But Red Robin's response was the best they could do without throwing the guys out, so kudos to them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=80

John C.,"Cleveland, OH",0,8,,1.0,10/7/2012,"I'm rating this place a 1. The only reason I can rate it this high is because our waitress was excellent. The food? Well that's another story.  First off I really enjoy a good cheeseburger. Sometimes even more so then a steak or some seafood dish. As my partner and I are driving to Red Robin, I'm telling her how good the hamburgers are. I had been to a Red Robin a few years back so I was speaking from a prior experience. I think it's safe to say I won't be picking the next place to eat out at for a long time after this experience.  We each had a 'schroom' burger which is essentially a cheeseburger with mushrooms. This burger was positively the worst hamburger I have ever had, bar none. It's not just me either as my date has an even worse opinion of her mushroom burger. How they made this thing or for that matter what the meat actually was is a mystery to me but the thing was totally TASTELESS. No flavor to the meat whatsoever. Absolutely nothing! Halfway through trying to eat this thing I pulled back the bun to see what the hell was in there (all the while my date is smothering hers with salt and wishing she had asked for mayo or mustard or just about anything to give her burger some taste). As I looked at the hamburger I can honestly say it didn't even look like a hamburger. She agreed. Nowhere on the hamburger could I find any trace of the thing being browned. What do they do boil these things? The only positive thing I can say about this mushroom burger is that the mushrooms were good. If you haven't already guessed, if I ever see another Red Robin again I'll be driving right by. As a side note, after eating this burger my stomach, and hers for that matter, completely agree with this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=80

Can make something much better at home for less than a third of the price.  There were lots of kids there too. Which is cool if you have kids, but not so much when you don't.

Dennis S.,"Columbus, OH",1,29,,4.0,4/19/2011,"I ate dinner here with my brother a couple weeks back - my first time at a Red Robin.  Apparently they're Zagat rated for having the ""best burgers"", so I had to order one.  I had the Bleu Ribbon Burger, which features chipotle mayo, blue cheese crumbles, and fried onion strings.  The burger didn't disappoint.  I'm a sucker for blue cheese crumbles on a hamburger, so it would have been pretty hard for them to screw it up. Burgers are the big draw to this place ... I'd have to say that their hamburgers are pretty much on par with those from other casual dining restaurants (eg. Chili's, Applebees), but they have a lot more variety.  For example, they have a burger marinated in teriyaki sauce and topped with pineapple and another with fried jalapenos, cayenne pepper, and salsa.  They also have about four or five different bun options, plus they'll let you customize any burger with extra toppings.

We went there approx 2PM. The approx visit was early April 2010.  Only reason It is getting 4 stars is becuase of the price. This location is also more expensive then usual locations.

Elishevah G.,"Brooklyn, NY",605,622,135,2.0,2/16/2009,"Two words come to mind: *simulacra* and *creepy* Remember the scene in ""Pulp Fiction"" where Uma Thurman and John Travolta go to Jack Rabbit Slim's, and everything is supposed to be all 1950's (""Would you like the Martin and Lewis or the Amos and Andy?"") - yeah, and it's basically a hollow reproduction of an ideal 1950s that never existed? And it's kinda cool, right, because we want to remember the 1950s like that... well imagine the same kind of thing, but without being able to choose your hamburger's well-doneness as ""bloody as hell,"" and with the encapsulated moment being not the pretty cool 1950s, but the gorgingly excessive 2000s.  My friend and I sort of happened upon this place since we had to go to Best Buy for something (btw: never again!), and suddenly found ourselves famished. Options at Easton being pretty limited, we settled upon Red Robin because of their purported ""gourmet burgers."" In My mind, gourmet means some bloody sloppy mess that is possibly still mooing and which also involves fresh romaine lettice, freshly sliced tomatoes, perhaps some gouda or otherwise gourmet cheese, and uber alles... NO conveyor belt cooking. I mean, honestly. I realize this is a chain restaurant (even though I'd only vaguely heard of it), but so is the Hard Rock Cafe, and I feel like I've eaten bloody half-mooing hamburgery goodness there before, even if it wasn't the best ever. Our experience at Red Robin was actually so... compelling... that we ended up going home and watching ""Waiting"" after.  To summarize: yes, the onion rings were good. I don't normally eat this type of food, so I don't actually have much to go off, though. The waiter actually told us that the burgers were made on a conveyor belt (gourmet - lies!! All lies!), and that rare or even medium rare was not an option. Both of our burgers were good enough, but you know. The were good enough, Considering. I was also not a fan of the garlic-butter-somethin' fries that our friendly waiter INSISTED i try.  Mainly we were completely distracted by the somewhat creepy sensory overload of this place - everything corporate, capitalistic and evil about America was reproduced in bright, glowing kitsch. It's hard to describe because between our textbook-friendly waiter and the enormous cow suspended from the ceiling, we were a bit overwhelemed. It's hard to believe that a whole sector of the American public really does enjoy this type of thing (people seemed very happy) - but my incredulousness is only my point of view; I certainly don't fault people for being themselves. I can't help noting, though, that places like this are why many foreigners think we're gluttonous chumps... Mon dieu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=80

And they have plenty to choose from with toppings as wide and varied such as eggs, shrooms, pot roast, pineapple and guacamole just to name a few. Did I mention bottomless fries? Well I just did. I should also mention that they keep a bottle of seasoned salt at the table so you can season your own fries. As much as I don't want to give a giant corporate restaurant a title like ""best burger"", they come pretty darn close. They certainly have some pretty creative chefs working at corporate to come up with burgers that not only make you raise an eyebrow, but that taste great as well.
