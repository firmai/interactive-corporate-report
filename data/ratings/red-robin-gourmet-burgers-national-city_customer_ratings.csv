But, I'll be returning!!  =)  The hubby and I shared the fried zucchini appetizer, YUMMERS.  We then each had a side salad (HUGE).  Then decided to share the prime rib dip sandwich.  I had mentioned to the waitress that we were planning to share the plate.  She brought it to us already divided (with no additional charge).

159,Kevin N.,"Chula Vista, CA",31,283,75.0,5.0,2012-02-12,"For the last 3 weeks, been there once every week. I love their food. It's basically a burger joint. However, there's so much variety. Oh, they have big ol' bottomless steak fries with their special seasoning (you can find their seasonong on any table you sit at). If you're not in a mood for a burger, they have chicken sandwiches, soups, not a big variety of wraps though, However they have a decent amount of appetizers - great for group events.  Overall, I'm there for their great customer service. My server was fantastic (Jody), she was on top of things. Everytime, I've been there I have requested her since.  Although, it gets busy Fridays thru Sundays. It's worth being patient. If the food is good, the wait is worth it. That's how I feel when I go to Red Robin.  Beware this is a kid-friendly place, so there will be a lot crying. I love children, so I'm able to put up with them and very patient. You can ask additional stuff such as extra veggies, condiments, etc. People who are have allergies or who do not want to consume gluten or/and vegetarians they have several options for them. One last thing, they have this Royality card. If you sign up, you get a free appetizer which expires 2 weeks once you activate it. You're eligible for a daily drawing to win daily prizes. You get promotional items in your email as well as after your 9th purchase, you get a free entree, appetizer or dessert.

292,Mrett N.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,2012-04-06,"Reading the other reviews, I'm beginning to wonder if I was at the right place... Anyway the Red Robin in Plaza Bonita was a serious disappointment.   Seriously. A big disappointment.  I really wanted to like this place.  I've seen the commercials and thought I was in for a treat--NOT!  My friend who came with me tried to warn me about the food, that we should go some place else, but on her previous visit to this same Red Robin (she came with someone else), she ordered a salad, not a burger, so I still wanted to go and try Red Robin for myself. Well, I ordered the classic cheeseburger, which arrived barely warm and overcooked.  The patty wasn't juicy at all (rather dry).  The cheese was plastered to it, as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for half an hour.  The lettuce was wilted. The taste was not memorable--was I supposed to season it myself using the Red Robin's Special Blend on the table??  The bun tasted like they just took it out of a bag and threw the over cooked hamburger on it.  It came with the wilted lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, but nothing on that burger was working in harmony like you'd think it would at a place that claims it serves gourmet burgers.  The steak fries were OK, but no one mentioned anything about them being bottomless--guess I missed out on that one, but you'd think the server would have piped up and offered??  I have to admit that the staff there is very cheerful and pleasant, but perhaps a bit inexperienced.  There was trash on the floor that most of the staff was oblivious to.  After about 40 minutes, one guy actually saw the litter and stopped to pick it up.  No one even asked how the meal was or anything.  I probably should have just sent the burger back and asked for a fresh one, but oh well...  Needless to say, I'll follow my friend's lead next time and won't return.  I could have gotten a much better burger at Carls Jr. for half the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=340,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.5320000000000005,3.4400000000000004

259,Meagan G.,"Windsor, CA",41,24,,3.0,2012-07-22,I grew up around a Red Robin so I already knew what to expect. Their burgers are good and they offer a decent variety on the menu.

199,Kimberly C.,"San Diego, CA",19,147,10.0,1.0,2012-08-18,"My husband and I, along with our 5 month old, stopped in. I asked the host if it was at all possible to eat outside on their ""patio"" since we had a stroller, and out child was sleeping. (Any parent knows why this was important to us.) I explained that I worked in this business as well, and I knew it was busy and if it was a problem, I understood. She said she would ask the manager, which she did, and the manager, I was told, said yes. She told us to pick a place to sit, brought us menus, and told us she let the server know. We wait, and wait. I picked the seat near the door so we could see into the bar area and so we would be seen as well, just in case we would be forgotten about. I even went inside and spoke with the host again, in case she forgot we were there. We wait some more. I notice multiple servers and even a manger walk by the door and make eye contact with me. NO ONE EVER CAME!!!  I understand they were busy, but, being a service manager myself, if you notice people outside, maybe check on them or follow up with a server/manager. Or maybe the manager should not have said yes to the request if they couldn't handle it.  We finally left. We walked by 30 min later, our menus were still on the table. Thank goodness we didn't sit and wait longer. My husband and I were looking forward to a meal together, out in public! Any parent knows what a rare occasion that can be.  So, thanks Red Robin and the manager for making it a night to remember... wait, scratch that.... a night I hope to forget.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=280,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.6280000000000006,3.4400000000000004
99,Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4070,28020.0,4.0,2012-09-12,"I am a trollop when it comes to patty melts, and I was happy to see they had one on the menu here for $8.99 which came with all you can eat steak fries! ( )   I had them make the melt medium and they gave the cooking temp justice. The melt was very good. The beef patty was flavorful and juicy. ( ) The sauteed onions were succulent and tender. I like that they served the Thousand Island on the side, so that I could control the amount I put on my patty melt. The marbled rye was perfectly grilled and had a great crunch with a nice rye flavor. Great patty melt to say the least. The steak fries were good, but my first serving came lukewarm. My second serving came steaming hot straight out of the fryer. They had a crunchy exterior and soft flavorful center. They were much better than my first serving. ( ) The service was great. It was a little intrusive when I first arrived, but I politely told them that I had not even had a chance to check out the menu. After that, everything went smoothly and was on point. My refreshing iced tea was refilled several times, ( ) and I was asked how my meals was and if I needed anything else. Good service.

156,Jodonn D.,"Avalon, CA",69,26,53.0,4.0,2012-11-05,Came in on a Friday night with the family. Was seated within 10-15 minutes. Jose was our waiter and took good care of us. We were ten minutes early for their late night happy hour. He took my drink order and put it in right at the start of happy hour. Ordered the Burnin' Love burger. Nice and spicy. We've been to Red Robin a few times already and it's nothing better than any other joint. Wrote this review to recognize Jose who was excellent. Checked in on us frequently and have prompt refills on drinks and fries. Average burger restaurant prices but great happy hour prices after 8pm.

Reasons to go: 1) Menu.  Burgers are unique & tasty! 2) Bottomless fries.  The home-style fries are pretty good with the Red Robin seasoning. 3) Location. It is on the outside of the mall and a great option while shopping. Reasons to avoid: 1) Value.  At this particular location, the service and quality of food simply doesn't match the prices that are paid. 2) Location.  You can pay under the amount of Red Robin and get better quality food next door at the Mexican restaurant. 3) Service.  I have a few pet peeves that abrasively irk my soul: bad drivers, people who don't pick up their dog's p00p (especially if I have to clean it off my shoe) & not getting the check paid for when I am ready to leave a stinkin' food establishment.  These guys hit hard enough on the third that I am not going back.  Too many other options with El Torito next door and the food court inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=220,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.6640000000000006,3.3600000000000003
208,Odette S.,"City Heights, San Diego, CA",35,23,,4.0,2012-12-17,"Not the best place in the world to get a burger, since it's part of a chain of restaurant and that never makes me a fan, that and the fact that the only sort of good beer is the Sam Adams seasonal lagers.. anywho... I'll give the place four stars mainly because you can make any burger a Vegan Pattie or a Gardenburger. As a vegetarian there are not so many places you can do that, and yo have to settle for the Veggie burger they have predetermined for you. Hey! Vegetarians want sauteed mushrooms, or jalapeño in our burger!  The server was nice, even tho we waited a bit for fries but it really didn't matter.. If you are going to share your burger, let the server know so they cut the burger for you and you don't have to get all messy in your table trying to cut the burger in half.. just saying!

144,Gianne W.,"Los Angeles, CA",486,248,44.0,1.0,2013-01-10,"Not to sound like a beezy, but whenever I step into a restaurant, I always expect service to be good ( no service, no tip and that's my rule ). I'm pretty blunt. I've only been to This restaurant twice, and twice I told myself "" sure why not give this place another try""..but I knew in the back of my head if you don't like it the first time, you probably won't like it the second time. Came here on a Monday night with my boyfriend and we were seated in the corner of the restaurant close to where the exit was. At first I didn't mind, but my boyfriend kept on mentioning how freezing it was because people would be exiting and coming in through the exit every 5 minutes or so. I also noticed that we were seated far away from everybody else as well and this made the servers less likely to come to our area.  We ordered a salted caramel milkshake which tasted extremely salty so we had to get the attention of a waitress and asked to get it remade with less salt. When our food finally arrived ( with a different waitress before ) we asked about our salted caramel milkshake and she looked confused, when I overheard her talking with the bartender that made our drink, he said "" no they didn't want it, they said it tasted too salty ."" The waitress came back and apologized telling us she would remake it. When it was remade and finally set on our table, we took a sip and it turned out to be a vanilla milkshake. No hint of caramel whatsoever. We asked to take it off our bill and the waitress looked a bit upset. She ignored us the whole night except for refilling our fries and when we were finished we waited almost half an hour just getting our bill.

210,Belinda B.,"Chula Vista, CA",29,23,2.0,2.0,2013-01-21,"I have been a fan of Red Robin for a long time.  Good rewards program, bottomless fries, Guinness on Tap, good burgers with a variety to choose from, and a late happy hour.  Lately I have had a disappointing experience.   They no longer have Guinness on tap, straight out of the bottle, and while their burger selection is still pretty good, more often than not, my burger has been overcooked to burnt.  I ALWAYS ask for the burger ""pink"".  I have never gotten it the way I ordered it, but I can usually deal, most places have trouble cooking a burger with any rareness, so I am used to it.  On my last visit, rather than being even close to pink, it was charred around the outside and way over done.  Pretty much the opposite of what I asked for.   Because of this and a few other times the food was sub-par, I believe the  quality control has gone down hill.   So to sum up, Red Robin has gotten rid of two of my preferred menu items, Guinness on Tap, and French Onion Soup, burgers are not made as requested, and they really have not improved their menu with any of the recent changes made.   Given these developments, I will be looking for other places to spend my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=240,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.6640000000000006,3.2400000000000007

The bleu burger had bleu cheese obviously with crispy thin fried & battered onions along with the standard veggies and condiments on it.  The flavor just hit the spot for me... I was looking for a mama to slap IT WAS THAT good, but instead the new years resolution-ers that just came out of the gym next door decided to pick this place to blow their diet and say, ""I'll start my diet again tomorrow."" ... so in short no slapping took place.  The cobb salad was big, protein worthy, delicious and expensive.   Service was fine, nothing special, nothing spectacular.  She had me debating on giving her a 10% or the standard 15%...

Atmosphere and service was decent. Got my refills promptly. They do what they're known for pretty well - namely their steak bottomless fries and their freckled lemonade. Both are quite addicting and before you know it you'll have finished either/or or both before you finished your burger. I'm not a ketchup person so the fries can be a bit plain without them - try them with the signature seasoning salt. The lemonade is very sweet and the strawberries are sweet enough to munch on as a dessert. For some reason I ended up getting fish & chips. My brother made fun of me as I got FISH AND CHIPS at a BURGER JOINT. I think I'll stick to burgers, as I have gotten much bigger and much better quality fish & chips for about the same price at pubs, even with the vinegar and tartar sauce. The gooey chocolate brownie cake is anything but gooey - Chilis does it better. The cake was quite dry. Also don't see how it can be any better with strawberries.

My favorite item of the night was the tower of onion rings with campfire mayo!!! So bomb. Service.... My server was so kind and so attentive to my big group of 10. She really went the extra mile in making sure that I had the best experience ever. She really worked out the itty bitty things for us like more refills more fries extra sauces and seperate checks. If I'm correct her name was melissa. :)))  Will definitely come back for more onion rings and great service. Thanks red robin for making my birthday a memorable one to remember.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=180,3.2,3.29,3.29,2.7399999999999998,3.254

We were seated in the bar area by the hostess. Our server came over and took our drink order and then returned for our food order and that was the last time we saw her. Someone else brought out our food and we had to ask another server for refills of our drinks. No one checked to see how our food was...no sort of serve whatsoever. Normally when a server leaves for a break or end of shift they stop by with their relief and let you know who will be helping you...nothing. We had been done eating for probably 10 min, our plates had been cleared and we were looking for someone to get us our check so we could go.

219,Tamarah G.,"Chula Vista, CA",12,87,4.0,1.0,2013-10-01,"I am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 star. I went here recently for lunch. The place was MAYBE 1/4 of the way full and I counted at least four waitresses and a hostess on the floor when I came in. I waited with my kids for about five minutes  before we were seated (and we were the only ones waiting). We were seated and the waitress took our drink order right away (we all just got waters). Those came quickly, she disappeared for about ten minutes and didn't come back for our food order until I ran out of water. She took our order, refilled my water and disappeared again. It took a good 25 minutes for our food to come out and I saw two tables that came in AFTER us get their food while we waited. My poor kids waited so patiently, I think they did better than I did. I was ready to leave when our food finally came out. It was good, but not worth the wait and low blood sugar.  My youngest had to go the bathroom, so I took both of my kids (they're young), leaving my sunglasses on the table. We passed our waitress, I informed her that we would be back in a minute. I don't know if she was spaced out or what, but we were in the bathroom for no more than 2 minutes and when we came out our table was cleared off, including my sunglasses. I sat down and waited for the disappearing waitress. I was there for a couple minutes, flagged her down and explained what happened. She disappeared into the kitchen and I waited another 7 or 8 minutes and never saw her or my sunglasses again :( I don't think I will ever be going back to this Red Robin. Or any of them.

Maybe I'm spoiled by the many other delicious burger joints in San Diego, but my friend and I who dined here even compared it to McDonald's and sadly, we agreed at McDonald's would've been better.  The main point of our complaint was the food, we both ordered our burgers medium rare and the burger was overcooked therefore, they were burnt. The other problem with our burgers was the fact that it tasted PLAIN! The only flavor was the charred taste. I ordered the guacamole and bacon burger and there was such a thin layer of guacamole that I didn't taste it through the lettuce. The bacon tasted as though it was cooked once then microwaved and thrown into my burnt burger.  As for the bottomless fries, no one offered us a refill on them. Much less offered us more water to wash down the burnt flavor.  At the end of the day I would never return to this location nor would I recommend it to anyone...

The food is delightful. I suggest getting the onion ring stand, at least that's what I call it. You can either get 6 or 12 nice size onion rings on a rack. Great for ring lovers. If you love burgers then you will love all the many selections they have. I say each time you visit try a new burger. The only thing I had to check them on was the milk shake was ordered to go. They didn't fill it up to the top. And if you know milk shakes you know it's filled to the top not 3/4's that's a milk shake sin... However, they were nice enough to take and fill it up.

This was my second attempt here and this time we were able to not only be seated in a timely manner, but also had a pretty awesome server. The hostess tried to ensure that we had a handicap accessible table due to the fact that my grandmother was dining with us and she uses a walker which takes up more room and also means that my grandmother needs to be able to get in and out of her seat with ease. In regards to the food my daughter ordered a Black Pepper Bacon burger on ciabatta which she loved. She said it was cooked to perfection. My grandma got a simple double cheese burger from the kids menu which was just the right size since she doesn't have a huge appetite. As for myself I ordered the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad without beans, I wish the description would've mentioned it had onions... Since I hate onions.

The refill fries are in a smaller serving than I have seen at another Red Robin location. The restaurant is nicely themed and has interesting decor.  The staff is horrible. Our waitress was impossible to waive down, it seemed as if she was trying everything to avoid eye contact with us. At one point she was walking by, and I asked her for napkins and fries, but she did not hear the fries part because she didn't even stop to listen to what else I wanted, she kept on walking and left me talking by myself. If I had been by myself I would have walked out. Every time she came by I had to basically quickly yell what else I wanted so she could hear my requests as she would drop off things and leave.

We always end up needing to order a second basket right when we get our first basket in order to prevent time with no fries.

I just about walked out but I flagged our server down-who was so busy chit chatting she didn't notice our sense of urgency, and I told her to just have them box it up. Honestly, I don't know why I didnt just cancel the order and pay for the stupid drinks...I was trying to be nice. Server apologized and explained that they had very little kitchen help and that was why they were so slow. She went out of her way to ask management to comp our meal. I thought it was just a bad experience and didn't want to write them off. Present: it was not that busy in the restaurant at 9p but it took forever to get our drink order in. We had to ask for utensils from our server. Both of us got the wrong buns for our burgers and it took over 30 minutes to get our food.  The tables and menus were sticky. Will not go back EVER.

The burger I had upgraded from the tavern patties to the single regular (thought it was gonna be a double?)but honestly I couldn't tell the difference.

211,Mike C.,"San Diego, CA",49,32,4.0,4.0,2014-06-08,I've eaten here before and had a pleasant experience. I came today for my son's birthday and we ordered burgers. We were seated quickly and served drinks immediately after we ordered them. Food took a bit longer than I would've liked for burgers but it wasn't too bad. Food came and was not bad. They serve steak fries and they are all you can eat fries so the initial portion with the meal is minimal but manageable. The waitress was attentive and my only issue was not having napkins or silverware at the table. It wasn't busy so there's really no excuse for missing that part. Overall a good experience and would come back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=240,2.8,3.1,3.1,2.544,2.9800000000000004

One of the people in my party ordered a salad but since the waitress didn't like coming to our table, she decided to bring the salad with her burger instead. I ordered the Double Tavern Burger thing and it was a Burger King burger for sure. Just three times the price. I would say that the plus is the bottomless fries, but she decided she didn't want to bring any until we asked. Keep in mind we have a party of four and there are about seven fries on each of our plates. Three of the four had hot fries in their basket and I had semi-stale and very cold fries in mine. Luckily the ONE basket of fries she ever brought was hot so I was able to eat those. Our drinks were also never refilled and we finished them before the food was out.

224,Danni K.,"San Diego, CA",5,21,2.0,2.0,2014-07-29,"It was decent the first time I went, however the second time wasn't a very good experience.   The order came fast, which was good but the fries were cold.  I think instead of waiting until the burgers were done to serve the fries, they must have put the fries on the plate and waited, which made them cold.   The second time I went with my parents and my dad ordered the fish and chips, mom ordered the regular burger and I ordered what I like to call the cowboy burger.. which is onion rings, bbq sauce, etc. It's known as a cowboy burger originally.  The burger meat was over seasoned because it came out very salty.  The oil from the fat of the burger was soaking through the buns.  I couldn't finish the meal, only ate about half.   Later that night both my mom and I got sick.  We figured it was from the burger meat.  When I researched it, turns out a lot of people had that experience around the day we went.  Most likely a bad batch of meat.  My dad was fine but he ordered the fish and chips.  We never went there again, maybe in a couple years I'll give it another try but two bad experiences in a row is going to keep me away, especially that second experience since both my mom and I got sick that night.   The waitress was very nice though, a sweet older lady, we gave her a nice tip. You could tell she was working hard, probably had been there a while and was about to end her shift.  She was very nice as we explained that we didn't care for the meal.  We tipped her anyways because she was kind and it wasn't like she was the one cooking and preparing the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=200,2.84,3.04,3.04,2.248,2.9600000000000004
77,Megan C.,"San Diego, CA",1,33,3.0,1.0,2014-08-01,"Ok, so a Red Robin is a Red Robin--I won't comment on the overall experience of eating at this chain restaurant. It is what it is. Just a couple of things about this particular location: First, for the gluten-free folks, every time I order a burger on the gluten-free bun here, it's SUPER stale. I have not had that experience at other RR locations so I don't know what the problem is here. Maybe they're storing them in the freezer too long. Second, it's always hot in there. Either they don't have air conditioning or it can't keep up. The waitstaff have always been nice, but eating a hockey puck while sweating is no fun. Update: if you do go like we just did (I never learn, apparently) avoid sitting in the bar area. The male bartender/waiter who is there at lunch time on weekends didn't write down our order and was multitasking while half-listening to our orders today. Sure enough, both of our meals were wrong--my husband's burger cooked wrong (he ate it anyway) and my burger on a bun when I ordered it in the lettuce wrap due my dietary restrictions.

The basic cheeseburger is just ok.  Its more like a whopper because it seems like the condiments overtake the patty.  The meat doesnt have a flame grill or char character to it.

Walked in with a friend of mine, plenty of open booths, some still needed to be cleaned but otherwise open...and instead of asking us where we would like to sit or even sit us where anyone would want to sit (a padded booth) we're sat at the high tables next to the bar...as are the next two groups of people, crammed together.

I get it when restaurants get busy you have a smaller chance of being noticed by the wait staff, but they weren't busy....and there isn't an open soda/water fountain where I can re-fill my own cup.  As customer it's frustrating and annoying when you're paying a few bucks extra for the sit-down experience and are promptly ignored.  After looking around the restaurant it seemed odd, tables weren't being cleaned off in a timely manner (one of the tables that had dishes on it was still dirty when we left) and the staff seemed overwhelmed by the few people that were there.

More misses than hits tonight. I'm glad the apps we shared are available as half orders.  -Chicken wings and chips. A half order is four pieces served over a bed of crunchy, crinkle cut potato chips. The buffalo sauce is mildly spicy with not much lingering heat. The BBQ sauce is sweeter in comparison and neither overly piquant nor smoky. What mostly grossed me out was how undercooked and fatty the birds bits were. I would've preferred a crispier exterior and cooked through for longer. -o' ring shorty. Their mini tower of 5 onion rings. Dat familiar crispy goodness perfectly uniform from the freezer and fried just right to my table. I actually like RR's rings because they are reliable at every location. -bacon cheeseburger. I added a fried egg just because. I'm glad I did because the bacon was thin, fatty and rubbery like it was microwaved. -bottomless fries. Not great this time. Mostly cold and soggy potato planks. Not even their magical seasoned salt could revive them. Other than the onion rings, the food was subpar and the service shined as tonight's saving grace. We don't frequent this location often, but compared to other RR joints, either the quality has diminished and/or the someone needs help in the kitchen.

59,Tom H.,"San Marcos, CA",67,73,108.0,1.0,2014-12-28,"I can't believe that so many people go to this particular restaurant. The red robin in UTC is farther away, but it is far superior in every single aspect. This one in Bonita is just terrible.  My wife has some strict dietary requirements that only a few big chains cover, and thankfully red robin meets these requirements. Unfortunately, we live close to this location. We don't have too many options for dining out, and if my wife wants a night out at a restaurant that doesn't require a 45 minute drive, this is the only option:( The service is routinely slow.  Don't trust the people up front when they tell you how long the wait will be; tonight we were told 20 minutes and waited just over an hour. The food just doesn't taste as good as any other red robin, it just is bland. Also, if you order a gluten free bun, expect it to be stale, that way you won't be disappointed when it comes. They won't let you sit outside; ever. I don't know why they even bother with tables out there.  Tables sit unbused for long periods of time while the pile of people waiting u the door grows larger.  Right now I'm counting three tables with dirty dishes and 10 people waiting by the door. It just feels like the management at this location is consciously understaffing to save money.  The waiters, in my experience, don't seem particularly happy or interested in human interaction.

I ordered the Freckled Lemonade and the Royal Red Robin burger with garlic herb fries and decided to try the bacon aioli. I really liked the Freckled Lemonade and it's definitely one of my favorite drinks there (the twisted cup it comes in is really cute). As for the burger, the patty was cooked fine but the egg was slightly underdone. Adding a little of the bacon aioli helped boost the flavor but it was just alright.

The chicken wrap was ok but the onion soup sucked. It was bland the bread was disgusting. I switch it to the tortilla soup. It was good but the fact that there was a hair in my soup did not jive with me! The last of our appetizer chicken tenders was not cooked thru and it took for ever to get refills. Not a good first impression:/ oh my son. Got sick from the spaghetti he ordered. So my husband n family decided to give red ribbon one more shot we went to UTC about three weeks later.

Does that make sense? I don't crave it, per se, but if the name appears or a commercial plays, then I want to go. I don't think the advertisers are doing a good job... I just believe that I want to go because the gaps in between visits to this place are literally at least a year apart.  My favorite part about Red Robin is the unlimited strawberry freckled lemonade--it even comes in a cool cup! I would probably come here just for that drink, to be honest. Their burgers, though, let me talk about that... I'm going to speak about my latest experience because 1.) it was most recent and 2.) I don't really remember the other times. So, my boyfriend and I went to go here for linner (lunch-dinner) because I wanted a booger that wasn't too far from where we were. He had never gone either, so I thought ""Why not?"" I ordered the ""royal red robin"" because I saw it had egg, which I love, and he had the ""guacamole bacon"" because he didn't want to copy me (plus he wanted guac!)  Our server, who was a nice and attentive girl, asked us how we wanted our patty cooked--pink or no pink. I said, ""No pink,"" while he said the opposite. When our burgers came out, my boyfriend's burger was pretty cooked through, except for a minimal portion. He wasn't picky about it, but he wished it had been more pink. I liked my burger, though. The yolk broke all over it, which was yummy! I was disappointed in the amount of fries the both of us received. When I used to go here, I remember getting a lot a lot a lot of fries! Nowadays, it literally looks like there a 10 fries with my burger. I get that they're unlimited, but come on now... I can finish those fries in a minute. For $.99 more, i upgraded my steak fries to garlic herb fries.

One, it registered as the ""Holy Grail"" burger in the burger hierarchy. Two, it was the seminal product in determining any future visits. The burger seemed like any other burger, see photos.

The busser was really sweet and gave them to us, we even mentioned they hadn't given us napkins nor tupperware and he was surprised. Our waiter was extremely forgetful. He actually never even brought the sweeteners we asked for, nor none of the lemon wedges we asked for with our drinks, and only brought the napkins and tupperware with our dinner (after we had already eaten our onion rings).

39,Andy M.,"Chula Vista, CA",414,211,740.0,3.0,2015-07-27,"This is the perfect example of how a place can have great food but if they lack in customer service there reviews & ratings will suffer for it. The food here is great, I love the burgers here for the most part there all good I've tried a few, the one with the fried egg is my fav. The fries here are on point & the best part they have bottomless fries here which is awesome. There chips with the chipotle sauce is a very good appetizer as you wait for you're food & trust me you will wait for you're food. The kid options & shakes are good as well. The food always comes fresh & tasting good. Some of the best burgers I've eaten have been here. Yes I love the food here, so why don't I come here more often? Well the service is SLOW & SAD! Every time I've come here the wait is long & never really that busy so I don't get it. And you know what the wait isn't even the real problem here. I don't mind waiting a bit for good food as long as the service is good. Now don't get me wrong the service ain't bad but it ain't good either. Considering that they know the food takes awhile (cuz a lot of people complain about that here) you figure they be more on point.  For example the couple times we are there we had to wait awhile & as we did we finish our drinks & no one would come & check on us ever! We had to flag our waitress down & call them over cuz every-time they walked by us it's like they knew we needed something & they rush by us & not make eye contact with us, they did this with customers as well. We have waited 30 min with no refills & no food & no one asking us if we want more chips or apologies, that's unacceptable! We're not the only ones I've actually seen customers ask to speak to the manger, which I don't do cuz I try not to have tension with my waiter I want to eat peacefully but it's hard not to sometimes. The waitress here are not mean or rude but there not nice or friendly either there just like Blah. Some of them don't even look like they want to be working there, there just there to get a little check & pay there iPhone bill. People like that shouldn't be waitress & working serving people. Look I don't need red carpet attention or a hug when I walk in a restaurant I just want a refill on my drinks & a smile & just check on us & tell us why it's taking long & a apology that's it. I don't even know if it's the waitresses or cooks that's taking long but the manger needs to find out where the problem is cuz it's frustrating (I use to be a manger at a restaurant it's not that hard to find out what the problem is). Retrain or hire some new fast or at least happier workers. Or maybe you guys just need to have an extra 5 min breaks to just hug each other & practice smiling & drink a Red Bull. I don't know but you guys need to do something.  Like I said the food is good & that's why I will continue to come but everytime we decide we'll come here we take a deep breath & say ""But damn the service is slow & sad"" & sometimes we say oh well & come anyways cuz we love the food but almost everytime we come the service fails us. The food thank god makes up for it but only  enough for 3 stars. This place has potential to get 5 stars if the workers would be happier & a little faster & be more considerate. I wish I can give them more then 3 stars but I can't. Maybe one day I will but till then, come on Red Robin workers cheer up you have a job & we're hungry please be nice & a little faster I'll tip you big I promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-national-city?start=60,3.32,2.86,2.86,2.8920000000000003,3.044

It wasn't busy at all, seated right away at the booth of our choice..  Our server was friendly and checked on us often..  They have a pretty large menu, mostly burgers.. And they are very accommodating to substitutions and special requests...  Their onion ring tower is pretty popular. Thick cuts of onion, came out hot. Comes with 2 dipping sauces.  Their pretzel bites were pretty good. The cheese sauce was a touch too running, I'd like the cheese to stick a bit more, but it had a nice subtle beer taste to it.  I got the bonsai burger this time around.. The patty is a nice juicy size.. And I like the teriyaki taste.. I didn't care too much for the pineapple though, a personal preference.. Husband got their special Oktoberfest burger, I forgot the exact name.. But it has sausage and candied bacon on it.. Any burger with their candied bacon is a score.. These burgers are a decent size and come with ""bottomless"" steak fries which can also he substituted for a healthier choice.. But I stuck with the steak fries and requested it to be ""extra crispy"" and it was just that, super crispy on the outside, soft inside.  Kids got the corn dog bites with fruit.

She sat them and walked behind the line (where they prepare food ). My husband and I then stood at the door waiting to be seated for 5 minutes. MIND YOU THE RESTAURANT IS DAMN NEAR EMPTY. So I was pretty confused and pissed to see that we weren't being seated. My intentions were to leave then but my husband said let's just go sit at the bar. So we sit there and wait for another 5 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge us. She finally brings us menus and water. I don't know her name because she didn't introduce herself. We ordered pretty quickly and got our appetizer fast. I saw the manager walking around finally in her pink polka dotted shirt speaking to various tables but never came to ours.

We got our entrees waaay before our appetizer, which came while we were halfway through our dinner. Second and even worse time, they quoted us 20-25mins for a table but actually got seated close to an hour later. And if that wasn't bad enough, it took 10 minutes (yes, we timed it after the horrendous wait time for the table) before a server actually paid any attention to us. And then, par for the course, said server went to check on us only twice yet again, just like the server on our first visit! She seemed more than happy to attend to the other tables except the two on our side. Thank God they've got those Ziosks on every table now, otherwise I shudder to think how long it's going to take them to give us our check and how long to get our card back.

The food is average to me and the service is sometimes a bit shakey. Once when we came here though there was a hair in my sisters salad. They changed it out and apologized but I kind of thought they would give us a free dessert or maybe a discount since my sis had to wait for a new salad but they didn't offer. Which they don't have to just thought it would be a nice courtesy. During that visit I also tried the garlic fries because I'm an avid fan of garlic fries but they didn't have the taste I was expecting. Guess I thought there would be more of a fresh garlic flavor, but it was more like a garlic powder flavor.  During my most recent visit yesterday although the staff was nice, the service wasn't great. I ordered a burger with onion but they never put the onions in. I had to ask for it. Then I ordered an onion ring appetizer which didnt come. When my entrees came out and still no onion rings I asked the waitress.

Quick bite to eat.....well, I was right on only one out of three.  The service was real slow. We were visited by different servers at different times but the time between visits were long. We even waited longer for our food. Total time dining was two and half hours. The only reason we stuck around was we haven't seen our friends in a while. They were also leaving San Diego after our meal.  The food was 'meh'. Even waiting for so long and starving.

Tables were left unclean all over the place. It Should have been a sign.  We order the buzz wings as an appetizer to share. Two burgers and drinks. Wings were burned and didn't not taste very good. We had to ask for ranch to help them get some taste. Very disappointed. Burgers were so dry and the buns were too toasts they were burned. We did not finish the burgers. Fries were not great either.

Eureka has much better quality burgers for the same (or slightly cheaper) prices. Also, Eureka has much more tasteful and mature atmosphere. Red Robin would probably be better for a family with kids.  They won't cook any burgers less than medium at Red Robin, which is unfortunate, because I prefer medium rare.  The atmosphere at Red Robin is very casual and playful. It's probably great for families with kids. They have iPads (or equivalent tablets) at each table for paying the bill and playing games during your meal. I find the iPads fairly distracting, but depending on the type of group you're with, the iPads could be fun.

We signed in yesterday around 6:45pm they told us the wait would be 20-30 mins for 2 adults and a baby, and yes we asked for a high chair since we weren't allowed to bring our stroller in. Both girls at the front were rude several times. They did keep apologizing about the wait but not until we had been waiting 45 mins did they decide to tell us they had a party of 25 and Thats why the wait was so long. That and the fact that they couldn't find a table for a high chair. What place doesn't accommodate havin a child with them?? My husband and I felt very frustrated and to be honest the girls up front made us feel as if having our baby with us was our fault and the reason for the long wait. Manager was nowhere around. We left upset, hungry and with a cranky baby. We could have had her in her stroller that whole time we were waiting. But no, we couldn't bring the stroller in with us. Very appalled by the terrible service, not being seated, terribly long wait, and the extreme rudeness of the employees here.

I seen the manger walk by and he did not answer keep walking though that was odd then he came up a little later and ask how it was going. Ok that is just stupid.

The burgers were disgusting, falling apart all over the plate with the driest meat you've ever tasted and gross wilted lettuce. And the service was also horrendous. We had two waitresses both of whom were lazy and inattentive. They just kept bringing out plates and glasses with out ever taking any away, at one point we had six empty dirty plates and five empty dirty glasses on our table. Absolutely terrible.  In short, you'll get a better meal from a fast food joint. The food here sucks, and the staff is unbelievably LAZY. Never ever again. Go literally anywhere else.

67,Kendell W.,"San Diego, CA",133,4,,1.0,2016-10-01,"If I could give zero stars I would but This was by far the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. First we were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for a party of 2, understandable it was a Friday and it seemed pretty busy. They asked us for a phone number and told us they would text when our table was ready. There were no seats inside so we just sat outside to wait. 30 minutes go by still no seat, 45 minutes still no seat, an hour goes by still no seat so I go in to check how much longer the wait is. I ask the hostess she looks through the list and she says that it doesn't look like my name is on the list. She said that her manager reset the list and that we weren't the first ones to come up saying the didn't get sat. She then went to get her manager but when she came back she said that they didn't want to come up and that she's sorry that it's gonna be another 15 minutes. As I'm walking out of the door the manager came out and then asked me what happen then sat us after a few minutes. He took our drink order, we got a freckled lemonade and a raspberry limeade. Our actual waitress brought out our drinks then took our food order and we ordered the Nacho.m.g for an appetizer, I got the buzz Mac n cheese burger cooked medium well , and my girlfriend got the a1 burger cooked well done. So the nachos come out first and a different girl brought out our food. By this time I was done with my first drink and I set the empty glass at the edge of the table. The nachos had barely any cheese at all and the little cheese it did have was all in the middle and was microwaved too long. Shortly after the nachos came the same girl that brought out our nachos brought out our burgers. My girlfriend takes a bite out of her burger and it was the complete opposite of well done and mine, when asked for medium well, was extra well done. For me it wasn't a big deal I still could eat mine but for hers it was unacceptable so we press the call server button on the table. We wait about 10-15 minutes again for her to just come up to our table. Now again she didn't bring out our food just took our order and this is 10-15 minutes after we've already started eating and this server never once came to check on us or ask if our food is tasting okay. We ask if she can bring it back to make it well done she takes it and they make a whole new burger. Now by the time we get a new burger my girlfriend has already finished her drink and she drinks extremely slow. When they bring out the new burger a new person brings it out, sets it on the table and walks away without saying anything. This burger was cooked fine so we continue to eat but, still have no refills on drinks, no water and also no napkins. Now I could probably wave my hand and ask for a refill but I feel I shouldn't have to especially if my server has ignored us literally the entire time and she even walked past our table multiple times and looked over at our table. So it's getting close to the end and my girlfriend wanted to take the rest of her food home. So we hit the call server button again and this time we wait another 10 minutes for her to come to the table so we ask for a box. We watch our server go back and fourth with a table next to us and also receive boxes and refills. Another 10-15 minutes go by and by this point I got the attention of the guy that sat us in the beginning and let him know what else had happen. It only took him a couple minutes to get us a box and he also gave us a 25 dollar gift card because I had already paid while waiting for the box and we just wanted to leave. I've served for many years in the past and this girl should definitely find a new job. We won't ever be coming back to this location for red robin.

And to have to wait 20 minutes for a drink and then another 20 minutes for fries is just ridiculous.

She hung with the big dogs and came out shinning. Only one plate came out incorrect from the kitchen. She smartly gave the choice of keeping the plate but attentively was on the ready to replace... We were well taken care of and.... How happy am I that they had Belching Beaver on tap and 3 menu items at $6.99. I can say it won't take us as long to go back and Sammy is a keeper. Very personable.

No Ok cool , thanks after we gave him the drink order- kinda odd and not personable in the slightest.

I asked for no lettuce, shredded lettuce to me is gross and it was covered in the stringy gross'ness. ok I can get passed that lil thing, but my boyfriends grilled cheese, was only grilled on one side and wasn't a gooey cheesy yummy filled sandwich. It was a half assed hard funky nasty cheese mess. Grandmas cup of soup wasn't even luke warm, was cold - granted she didn't care, come on man- leave it under that heat lamp a lil longer to at least let the cheese on top melt somewhat!

I do enjoy lettuce and tomato but for some reason I don't like them in my burger, specifically. I asked the server to make sure they don't include it and she acknowledged. When I got my Burger, I opened it to add some seasoning to it and found tomato and lettuce remnants in it. I picked it out and ate my Burger but it definitely tasted the heck out of what I didn't want in there, in there.  It comes down to laziness. They made the burger and noticed it's not the way I ordered it, and rather than saying ""we screwed up. Let's start over,"" they instead say ""oh crap. That wasn't supposed to be in there.... eh, just scrape the top bun and see if they notice."" It's fortunate with laziness like that that it wasn't an allergy issue because that could have been SERIOUSLY problematic for somebody. There is no reason any cook should prioritize their disinterest in doing their job over again (especially when they are paid by the hour, not the burger) over providing their guests with the great tasting experience they asked for and paid for. He not only robbed me of that satisfied experience, he also robbed me of the opportunity to brag on this about what a good job he (could have) did.  I tipped the waitress well anyway because again she wasn't the issue by any means. The scrapped food was an indication that the error was in fact not on her.

308,Jennifer W.,"San Diego, CA",28,17,6.0,3.0,2017-09-07,"We went on Wednesday night, 8 p.m.  When we went in, there was no one up front, except a customer with a stack of togo containers.  It was at least 5 min before someone arrived, who looked like the manager.  He did not acknowledge us at all, and immediately addressed the man with the togo food.  It was obvious that this was not going to be settled quickly.   He should have asked the man to wait, or called another employee to help.  Instead he left us standing there, waiting, and still no acknowledgement.  Finally, he offered to seat us, nearly 15 min after we arrived.  He then took us a direction toward tables, but then discovered they were unseatable and reversed.  He wandered in another area and then asked another employee to take us to a table around the corner..   This type of customer service continued. A server came and asked for a drink order.  We got waters and she left.  I then flagged her down and asked if we were supposed to order on the screen which is on the table, because no one had asked for our order.  She said no and took our order.  The food came out from Jose, who was bustling around very busily.We had asked for silverware when we ordered, and still had none.  he said he would get it, and then went and had another order at the window.  There were FOUR female servers standing there doing NOTHING, including the one who took our order.  They did not lift a finger to help, and we still had no silverware, or napkins. Jose was running around helping others furiously, and eventually got us our silverware.  The servers stood there doing nothing and never checked on us.  Jose was attentive and friendly.   I had wanted mustard and lettuce and tomato, but since Jose seemed to be the only one doing anything I didn't ask.  The first set of fries and cole slaw were very good, but the refills were not.  Slaw was almost sauceless and fries were overcooked.  Burgers were very good, but I needed more toppings and didn't want to ask because of the service inconsistency.   We were charged for a ""game"" that I had declined, and had to have it removed.  I don't appreciate having to use the computer to pay myself and type all of the needed info, that's what servers are for, and why I eat out and not at home. I might try it again.  They need a lot of training on what customer service is, including the manager.  Bathroom was dirty.

301,Riz B.,"San Diego, CA",140,56,114.0,4.0,2017-09-11,"Let me preface this by saying that I dont usually eat burgers, so I'm certainly hard to please when it comes to getting my order right. I got a margarita which were so good that I got a second round (especially since I don't normally drink, that's pretty big deal.)  I only like mushroom burgers without anything but the patty, cheese & mushroom plus I asked for extra mushroom & today I was served the perfect burger with a mountain of mushroom. (Bear in mind extra mushrooms meant that the bread would get soggy, but that's my own doing - besides I don't usually eat all of the bun anyways) Kudos to the server tonight (& I wish I had paid attention to her name, cuz she was great) so I have say getting my order right is definitely worth a mention. ... and of course Bottomless fries, which I like fat potatoey fries.  It's kickoff night so naturally it was loud, but not too busy & paying the check on the machine thing made it really easy to just get up & go. There's ample parking around the mall, or accessible by multiple bus routes. Locating the restaurant can be a bit tricky, it's upstairs by the food court & you actually have to walk outside to get to the front door.

It's in the mall and I usually don't come to Plaza Bonita but we are having our truck serviced so they offered to drop us off here to wait instead of the dealership.  So happy we decided to pop in here for lunch. Zoey is pretty good in restaurants, but Red robin makes it easy to enjoy and finish a meal without a tummy ache later (you know because you're shoving food down so fast before the kids start screaming).  So hostess was very friendly and made room for the super wide mall stroller we were using right by our table so we wouldn't get it stolen.  and you want Miss Sammy as your server. She is so sweet. First time here and she is just so friendly and the absolute perfect server. Attentive but not too attentive. She had us covered, but we still were able to enjoy our meal. The food. So amazing. Try the chipotle dipping sauce. You will not regret it. I love the bottomless fries even though I absolutely don't need it but yes, I love sharing a few of them with Zoey so that I can order her a cup of fruit with her meal. All in all great experience.  I love how you have the option to pay at the table. The server drops the check, but if you pay with a card you can take care of it right away.

My wife ordered the Honey-Dijon Wings-N-Chips appetizer ($9.00) and was very pleased with it.  She offered me a wing and it was pretty good.  However, the chips had soaked up the wings dressing, and were soggy.  Probably not a good idea to serve them in a bowl together. My Red Robin Chili Burger ($10.39) was at best, average.  The burger patty was fine, but the chili smothering it was far too simplistic in taste:  Just chili powder and raw onion.  The fries were awful.  Not very warm at all, and leathery.  Obviously old, hard, reheated fries.  I pointed this out to our server, (by clanking a fry on my drink glass) and he offered a bowl of fries to go.  Nope, just wanted to inform you how awful the fries were.  Left most on the plate.
