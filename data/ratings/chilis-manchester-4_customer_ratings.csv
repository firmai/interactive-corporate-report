Pretty disgusting. I ordered the margarita chicken with grilled shrimp. And my husband the salmon with grilled shrimp. As an appetizer I got the southwest egg rolls. That was he only good item I had. The shrimp was ok. The chicken was gross. The salmon was salty. The broccoli was soaking wet and salty. Worst chili's I've ever been to.

51,Tom C.,"Ellington, CT",52,99,58.0,3.0,2013-09-02,"With so many other options in Manchester and surrounding towns, Chili's is often overlooked as a dining out option.  I travel a lot for work so I often pick Chili's when traveling when I want a known entity rather than being surprised by what could be great or could be terrible at non-chain restaurants.  That said, you know what you're gonna get when you go to Chili's. We stopped in on the way to the movies across the street.  Service was quick and efficient on a Saturday early afternoon.  Drinks came out right away.  Food was brought out hot and sizzling (I ordered the fajitas of course!).  As is Chili's standard practice, they only brought out 3 (very small) tortillas to go with the heaping plate of sizzling steak, peppers, and onions, so I had to ask for extras which our waitress brought out right away.  It's a shame they don't bring out 4 tortillas to begin with... that's all I ever use so having to ask for extras means 2 go to waste! The food is A-OK.  It's not great, it's not gourmet, but it's a standard all its own.  For a quick, tasty bite before heading to the theater, it did the trick! All in all, this Chili's is pretty standard across the board compared to other Chili's I've been to.  Friendly hostess, fairly attentive waitress, good menu selection, decent food, and no hassles or delays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4?start=40,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

However when we walked in the hostess gave us a dirty look... Seriously, like mean mugged us. She continued to then rest her head on her hand on the hostess stand like she was bored and miserable. A party came in a few minutes after us.. And this hostess walked up to us.. At least we thought.. I kid you not helpers she looked my fiance dead in the eyes and asked ""how many"", which she started to answer.. And the woman cut her off and said ""I was actually going to seat them first"" and continued to escort the 5 FIVE 5 people who walked in after us to a table. What kind of rude BS was that?!?!? Our experience only got worse from there. When the miserable hostess finally sat us We must have got the new waitress. :( Poor girl couldn't tell her butt from her elbow (keepin it clean). We ordered $5 margaritas and chips and salsa. I again kid you not we didn't receive our drinks until about 20 minutes after we ordered. It gets better..... Those chips and salsa came out 10 minutes after the drinks... WHAT ARE THEY DOING BACK THERE????  We then placed our order with her when she finally brought the chips.. Mind you, at this point in time all of our drinks had been empty for about 15 minutes with no promise of a refill. After she took our order she did not come back.. I repeat ... She did not come back to our table.. Period.  With that being said we enlisted the help of the waitress who's section was next to ours.. She had minimal tables and was the happiest peppy little 21 year old you could imagine. Bussing her own tables and working hard. I slipped her a $10 and told her not to share it... At this time she became our waitress. She literally brought over our food refilled our drinks and generally speaking treated us like we were her very last hope at a tip.. WELL! when we were almost done with our meal our original waitress came back and asked ""how is everything"" ... Now I'm not normally this way but the words just blurted out ""great no thanks to you, can you go get the other waitress""?.  Our bill came to $140... A 20% tip would have been $26... I slipped the REAL waitress another $10 instructing her again to not share it. Now she had a total of $20..

The fajitas looked like they came out of a can. The enchiladas tasted microwaved and soaked in grease, but I guess you wouldn't be going here to satisfy any reasonably high expectations anyway. Everything felt too overseasoned, too salty, and generally bland (when you weren't getting hit by grease and too much seasoning). I could probably find a recipe for these online and make them A. more authentically, B. Cheaper C. better tasting.  They also have this weird attempt now at requiring a server to ""make"" guacamole at your table and honestly it's really unnecessary. They kind of just mix a paste awkwardly at your table, in something that I think the employee is required to do even if the customer doesn't want it necessarily hand made in front of them . To me that seems a little humiliating to the employee.  Overall it was a grease and salt fest.

They said it would take 45 minutes, which seemed excessive considering the order.  Actual time to get the food was over an hour.

Having no confidence, I checked the food.  Good thing I did because they forgot to include fries wth the burger.  It was just the burger in a large styrofoam container and a response ""oh, did I forget the fries?  Oops.""  I should have checked the burger, because when I got home, I found that it was made wrong and the stuff we asked to be held was on it. As I sat at the bar, I looked around and saw that the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Really no excuse for the long wait and then to have to wait longer.   Really lousy experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,1.8920000000000003,2.44

Not very packed but looked around and everyone was waiting for food/drinks. We had to waive our server down or call the manager over to even get a simple refill. Apparently several cooks had called out and I legit felt bad for the manager who apologized. Her server however could have told us from the beginning and focused on drinks and chips coming out quick. When the food did come out after 1 hr, it was cold as ice. The manager apologized and gave us gift cards to come back.

But the whole section they were searing customer in was completely a mess, it looked like fireworks with food and napkins and trash.

Looking around after we ordered, the majority of the people around us already have been served their food so we just assumed that it wouldn't be that bad of a time lapse until our meals came. Well it was almost an hour to be served a burger, side salad, mac and cheese and chicken tenders. The mac and tenders were standard as far as quality but my burger was a joke. Literally got a chunk of bell pepper and 1 onion ring on a rubber patty with bacon that looked like it was microwaved. The corn on the cob was slimy and nasty. I asked the server, with all due respect could you ask the manager to try again - this is disgusting and not worth the $12 you expect to charge me. Came back with another burger held by the boss which wasn't much better. He said he would discount our bill and give us a free dessert. He had no explanation for the quality of how the food was prepared.

I got an appetizer of the spiciest wings they have I forgot the name of it but it was very good and well said. Most places when they say spicy sometimes but  doesn't have a kick to it but these one sure do! We also ordered an appetizer of nachos and when they mean loaded, they mean it. Each an individual chip was loaded with cheese, beans ,beef, lettuce tomatoes ,avocado , onion, and sour cream. At first when it was served to us it didn't look very appealing and it didn't seem like it was enough for both of us but considering the fact that every tortilla chip was loaded it was pretty feeling surprisingly.

1,Cory S.,"Hartford, CT",135,21,4.0,1.0,2017-09-27,"I really love Chili's as a chain. I think they're a reasonably priced, fun place to go out with friends when you're not looking to do any intense foodie exploring. However, I was severely disappointed with the customer service during my visit here.  I came with a group of friends, and we called at least half hour in advance to warn them and make sure they would be able to take us. We were told they could certainly take us without any issues at all. Once we staggered in and begun taking our orders things went straight downhill. Overall, once we had all arrived, the service was pretty slow and several mistakes were made. My friend's burger was severely undercooked, orders were given to the wrong people, and one friend had to wait nearly 20 minutes before the waitress remembered to bring out her food, even after we asked. My friend with the undercooked burger had to wait nearly 45 minutes for a new burger. I ordered a second drink but never actually received it, but it was still on my bill.  Now a lot of my friends and i have worked in food service. We know horrible days happen and we didn't want to handle this with anger. We were informed that they were short staffed and that our waitress was somewhat new. The manager tired to be accommodating of all of our needs, but it still took far too long to actually assist us. While my friend with the undercooked burger received his meal for free, the manager only offered to take 10% of each our bills. If the issues would have been handled well then maybe I'd be okay with 10% off, but we were all inconvenienced by these prolonged waits for our friends' food. 10% off is such a laughable attempt at fixing the issue, especially because the first time they brought out the bills all the charges were mixed up. Our total time spent at this restaurant was nearly two and a half hours. I was completely disappointed in the attempts to resolve these issues.

The last few years, however, actually since they added the Zoosk tabletop devices, it became abysmal. (Not the end of the story - please keep reading) Most memorable was an evening that my son and I spent waiting for service. Then waiting for someone to tell that our order had issues. Then to receive our replacement order... when we flagged down a manager he gave us a quick lecture on using the Zoosk and advised we start doing that instead of waiting for service. Um... NO. Popular with families with small children, on that visit the restaurant was filthy and destroyed by previous customers with a lot of screaming kids, uncleared tables and debris scattered on the floors. It was really, really bad. SO we stopped going. Fast forward a  year ... THEN, recently, I received a 50% off coupon for fajitas and a separate one for a free birthday dessert in my email and decided to give it another try. VERY glad I did! They seemed to have come to grips with the fact that Zoosk does not make up for a live server. Still popular with loud children and babies, our meal was accompanied by a lot of nearby hungry crying - but at least it wasn't us!  We had an awesome, attentive waitress who was very open and friendly and offered several quick thinking options to my fussy son. As frequent restaurant diners we have learned to ask for what we want, including extra plates and pre-split by the kitchen desserts. Our food was tasty and well cooked and we had zero complaints. I had the beef and chicken fajita combo and it came with more fixins than I remember and I was very pleased. Kids had burgers and were equally happy. The salsa that comes with their chips is really good also. We were pleasantly surprised that Zoosk accepted our multiple coupons and felt like the evening was a total success. Now, all they need to do is renovate their restrooms... **addendum: worth mentioning that the street sign and all parking lot lights were not turned on and anyone coming for the first time would have thought they were closed. Reading through other recent reviews that read more like my introduction about how this place had ""gone down hill"" I think this location really seems to have spotty management.
