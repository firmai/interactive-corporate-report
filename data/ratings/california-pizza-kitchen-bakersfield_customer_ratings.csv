Went here around 4pm Thursday, dead inside only a couple of people, I noticed 3 female hostesses just standing around and gossiping -they saw us too and didn't do anything about it :(  Finally, this waitress noticed us and sat us down.

I can dig classy, and I would have no problem shelling out good money for a real classy pizza place...if thats not sort of an oxymoron. But this place....I mean they are charging at the lowest cost $13 for a pizza, and the dough isnt even fresh, its frozen packaged. They are stingy with the toppings and sauce as well. We also got an appetizer, another 9 bucks down the drain for processed and frozen meat filling. There thin crust pizzas should be sold as ""crackers with toppings"". I wasnt impressed, and you can definitely do better for your buck.   I think this place could do alot better with the menu and food quality.

Food and service was great UNTIL my friend began choking, and the server just stood there! After that experience I decided to give it another try tonight. Never again coming back. I arrive, and the hostess does not make eye contact with me for 3 minutes because she's staring down a co-worked rolling her eyes. When we finally are seated rudely, our server takes 5 minutes until she greets us.  My friend and I ordered, and I asked her for bread. We didn't get our bread and Dr. Pepper for 10 minutes! While impatiently waiting I overheard a server complain about his tips. When the bread arrived, it was hard and cold. My friend and I both ordered Kung Pao Spaghetti. NO FLAVOR whatsoever. So disappointed because I always order it and it is always delicious. The restaurant was not packed nor on a wait time. Ridiculous. Overall horrible service, food was disgusting.

88,Jesus B.,"Bakersfield, CA",32,26,21.0,3.0,2014-04-20,"Finally had an opportunity to eat here after having a gift card for a few months sitting in the back of my wallet.  we were going to sit on the patio since it was such a nice day, but the hostess said it might be a little bit of a wait outside since there was only 1 server, since my wife and I were hungry we opted for a booth inside,  no biggie.  Now the food. I picked the avocado, chicken, bacon (eggrolls? ) as an appettizer. They were amazing, nice and crispy with big chunks of chicken and bacon.  For the pizza my wife got the chicken club,  and I asked our server which she recommended between the spicy chipotle or the habanero carnitas, and she suggested the latter.  The chicken club was hard to eat, all of the toppings kept falling off . It looked like a salad in a bread bowl. The spicy habanero was pretty good and I was surprised the dipping sauce actually had a little heat to It.  I was a little dissapointed in the sense that it wasn't really what I would consider pizza. I love cheese, toppings, and my marinera.  I ended up paying 50$, (2 pizzas, 1 appettizer, 1 lemonade, 1 water) which is a little steep especially for the pizzas being so small. Taking that into account with the fact that it's a 25 minute drive, I don't think we will be back anytime soon. If we do decide to give it another chance, it won't be for the pizza. Maybe one of their sandwiches or salads, those looked pretty good.  Oh before I forget to mention it, the service was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield?start=60,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.1800000000000006,3.0400000000000005

My fiance and I usually look at a restaurant's menu prior to coming in. We usually know what we want. When the waitress (believe her name was Bree? Brea?) asked if we had questions about the menu, I said no not really, we are ready to order, she seemed rather annoyed and responded with ""Hmm, oh ok"" Sorry we made your job easier? After ordering she also asked ""So um did you want some bread?"" Do you have to ask? Of course! When another waitress brought our meals out, we had to ask for refills. We sat and finished our drinks, not once did our waitress check on us. Another waiter brought us drinks.

I imagine that there are some people who prefer a razor thin crust cooked to cracker consistency. I think there might be people who like a 2-3 inch space between the edge of the crust and the start of the tomato sauce. I might even entertain the idea that a tasteless and thin tomato sauce is really desired by some people. I however cannot believe that anyone wants to find a stick on their pizza. I found a piece of wood, the size and thickness of a tooth pick on my pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Perhaps a piece of sage brush, maybe the trunk of a bay leaf bush, never the less stabbing yourself in the gum with foliage is NOT my idea of a great pizza experience. Expensive, badly made, and simply not worth the money.

It is pretty much right in my backyard! Went in for 1130am which turns out to be a great time for lunch - hardly anyone else there. Host was there at his station, very friendly and so were our servers. Our main waiter was very attentive without being overbearing and did not hesitate to make menu suggestions. Ordered was a margarita pizza and a quinoa/arugula salad. Both arrived promptly and were great dishes! The pizza for $13 is huge and I took half home with me and that was after sharing. The restaurant IMO is beautiful but we learned today this location is about to undergo a 1.3 million dollar facelift to make it more modern and sleek (with more TVs at the bar). It will not close at this upcoming time but will shut down sections at a time until completion! I cannot wait to see what it will look like! There is a take out door as well. I love this style of pizza. Cooked very quickly in a hot oven with a chewy crust and quality ingredients. And NOT cooked until it is burned! The menu is vast and has something for everyone!

46,Kyle B.,"Bakersfield, CA",275,41,79.0,5.0,2015-06-26,"So last Tuesday My daughter, her boyfriend and myself decided to check out this new Next Chapter menu at California Pizza Kitchen.  We hadn't been to California Pizza Kitchen in over 7 or 8 years.  We arrive around 7pm and the place was not to busy for a Tuesday evening so the hostess seated us right away.  Within less than a minute our server Blake came over and greets us.  My daughter asks about the Strawberry Mango Cooler and decided it sounds refreshing so Blake fills our drink order and proceeds to tell us about the new menu, we ask a few questions and we make our choices. The first thing we order is our Appetizers.  I get the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings and she gets the Chicken Lettuce Wrap with Shiitake Mushrooms. First the Dumplings were wonderful!  light with just a hint of ginger, not over powering at all. It came with 6 or 7 on the plate I think and that was enough for all three of us.  I would defiantly order them again. The Lettuce wraps.  I enjoyed the lettuce wrap. But not as much as Taylor,  She had two.  I Liked the the fact that they didn't skimp on the Shiitake Mushrooms. The Main meal.   Here is where I was really impressed with their whole new menu.  They may be called California Pizza Kitchen but they have so much more now. I ordered the Ribeye.  Yep, you read that right!  A Ribeye at a pizza place.  Who knew?   This was a 12oz ribeye cooked perfect (the way I ordered it).  I'm already a blue cheese fan, so when I saw it came with a creamy blue cheese butter I was hooked.   I like the fact that when it was delivered it was still piping hot, not like it had been sitting around waiting on the rest of the food.  I tried the other entrees and will give you their review in a moment but this was by far my favorite and I will return for this steak again. My Daughter ordered the Halibut, now she lived in Alaska and worked at a fishing lodge last summer so she is a bit spoiled when it comes to salmon, halibut & crab.  In her opinion this halibut reminders of being back in Ketchikan, AK.  Not quite as good as catching it, filleting it and eating it all in the same 12 hours but about as close as you can get.  I was lucky enough to get a small sample of the halibut and I have to agree.  The halibut was tender but not to flaky and well it had really good flavor it certainly was not fishy. The boyfriend.  Being young and a boy played it safe and ordered a pizza.  Half pepperoni and half pineapple.  California Pizza Kitchen Bakersfield peperoni and half pineapple Pizza Jeremy, not one to give a lot of accolades did say he liked the pizza and after the last pizza place we went to (no names) he was happy they actually put enough topping on the pizza that you could taste the flavor.  This individual pizza was so big he had to take some home.  This is about as good as it gets coming from this kid. All in all it was a wonderful meal.  The service was top notch.  We really enjoyed the fact that not only did our server Blake make sure our drinks were never empty but, that the chef him self delivered some of the food and cared enough to check on us.  Now before you go thinking it was special treatment, sadly we're not that special, I noticed Chef Esteban, Ast Manager Zack and even the GM Frank seem to be taking a real interest in the customers. checking in on them, asking if there is anything they can get you, etc.  It was nice to see the attention they payed to all their customers.   They offered us a tour of the restaurant. How could we say no.  From the prep station to the back area and even the brick oven. We saw it all.  during the tour Chef Esteban told us how on days and evenings when they have time they love to take young kids back their and show them how to toss a pizza. As you can see I'm a pretty big kid. They showed us how to toss the pizza dough.  Must say this was a really fun night with my daughter and her boyfriend. One of the things that stood out to me is over the entrance to the kitchen was the American Flag.  I asked the GM Frank, who's idea was it to fly the flag.  He said it was his flag and he was proud of it.  I was very happy to hear someone proud to display the flag in a public business.  This alone goes a long way in my book.  Not to mention the fact that they also displayed images of  Bakersfield including The Fox Theater, The Clock Tower & The old Chamber Building at the Kern County Museum among other local images.  I have not seen many restaurants show as much pride in Bakersfield as I did on Tuesday night from the staff at California Pizza Kitchen. So in the opinion of just another Bakersfield local I would have to say that California Pizza Kitchen gets 5 out of 5 Stars from all three of us.California Pizza Kitchen Bakersfield Ohh, I almost forgot.  The best part was desert!

76,Jen H.,"Bakersfield, CA",52,169,988.0,3.0,2015-07-11,"CPK is located on the corner of Stockdale Hwy and Old River Rd/Calloway by the Elephant Bar. Adjacent parking lot is fairly large but is also utilized by people going to the Riverwalk nearby. Inside the decor is clean and modern. We recently tried some of the new dishes and were pleasantly surprised. The Maine lobster flatbread from the new summer menu actually had decent amount of lobster meat! The addition of dill gave it a nice cooling flavor. For dessert, the S'mores dish was delicious though I thought the graham cracker bottom was a bit dense. The toasted marshmallow was yummy-thick and gooey. My favorite pizzas are the mushroom pizza (with over 3 different types of mushroom including portabello and shiitake), the Californa veggie (inc red onion, mushroom, tomatoes, corn, eggplant) and the mushroom sausage pepperoni pizza. Spinach artichoke dip is consistently good. The white corn guacamole app is a bit in the small side. They have a good range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The strawberry cooler is a bit saccharine tasting to me. There are also no refills on that drink. A better deal are the lemonades (peach, strawberry, etc) which have unlimited refill for less than $3.  Our server for dinner recently was friendly and checked in on us constantly. However, she was vastly different from ones we have had at lunch. I'm docking one star due to the erratic lunch service we've had in the past which often required asking for water/bread and reminding the server about our order. Btw, the Rewards program is worth joining. Each time you go, after registering, you give the server your phone # which is associated with the account. This ensures you receive points for each meal that you have. After two meals, I recently received a coupon for $10 off a $40 meal which was instantly applied to our last meal.

Unless you're lucky and get one of the older and sweeter waitresses, don't expect a good time there. Oh yeah, did I mention that their dough for pizza is frozen?! No wonder it always feels so soggy.  Avoid this place and find better quality of pizza elsewhere.  If you are seated at a table, as per my experience, you will get your food before you get your water, napkins, plates, and silverware. Am I supposed to eat like a slob when I'm out?

They actually have pretty good tasting salads. One of my favorite salads from CPK has to probably be the Thai chicken salad. The mixture of greens and goods go well together and surprisingly very filling. The BBQ chicken salad is also a good choice. I'm not a huge fan of the unique types of pizzas that they make, but if I had to choose a favorite then I would definitely have to choose the spinach artichoke pizza. The artichoke and spinach seem to team up great together and even better when you add chicken. One of the things that stand out for me has to be the cookies.. Haha.. I know I know.. It's a pizza place and I'm choosing cookies.

Unfortunately my main squeeze has CPK cravings from time to time and he won't stop begging for it until I make the trek all the way to the other side of town to appease his CPK appetite.  We used to love the ""BLT"" pizza then it changed to the ""California club"" which is not a step up at all. It was a simple fresh pizza with cheese, bacon, lettuce with some sort of mayo and tomato.  The pizza now has chicken, avocado (which is actually good) and added arugula to the lettuce mixture.

So now I'm forced to specialize the order which the gladly do.  I have to order  it with no chicken and no arugula, I know it sounds like I'm whining...I am.  This last time I ordered spinach artichoke dip....it's usually always good and it was good this time too, but they didn't put the lid on correctly and it spilled all over so I ate it out of the bag grrrrr..I also ordered a petite wedge salad that was just ok.

As we walked up, my husband and boys took the rotating door and the hostess opened the door for me and cheerfully greeted us. We were seated right away as it wasn't crowded at all.

We were not upset at all because we're all human and she apologized profusely. But, boy was it a mess!  My husband and I shared a Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza. My youngest ordered Cheese Pizza and my oldest ordered Curly Mac & Cheese. The boys both like their food. Although I tried a bite of the Curly Mac & Cheese and didn't care for it. There was no flavor at all. Honestly, a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese is better. Now for our pizza...I was not impressed at all. There was something missing, I can't say what.

71,Ariana B.,"Bakersfield, CA",88,83,121.0,4.0,2015-12-06,"I usually try not to frequent chain restaurants. Especially here in Bakersfield where we have so many incredible local food options. However, there are a few exceptions, including CPK. Their food is pretty consistently good, the service is very friendly every time I come here from the hosts to the wait staff, and it seems that the company makes an effort to be creative and inventive with their menu choices. I remember being in like 7th grade (over a decade ago) when this place opened up. Through the years, I've noticed staff members that have been around since the early days. I think it means something to see that the employees generally enjoy their time here and have stayed put for so long.  My son, my mom, and I had a good lunch experience here this week. Our waitress - Jules - was very sweet and attentive. It was a little hectic from me changing my mind mid-order, my son being hungry and grouchy, and my mom wanting a slew of things for her coffee. Jules didn't bat an eye and gave us friendly service that I generally expect from CPK.  The food was pretty great, as usual. I ordered a lunch combo of half soup/half sandwich. It was tasty & a good amount of food for about 8-9$. I usually order a pasta dish or an appetizer (especially those avocado rolls...omg yum) and I'm never disappointed. Plus they have flavored lemonades...I know that sounds so menial but seriously they're so good. It's hard to come here and not get a raspberry lemonade. It comes looking like two solid stripes (lemonade + raspberry) and just trust me, mix it up and you'll taste heaven. I know there are other flavors but I'm hooked on the raspberry. May need intervention.  We tried their seasonal pumpkin + gingerbread cheesecake and I decided pretty quickly that I would do my best to emulate what I tasted that day into an equally delicious dessert for my post-Christmas meal. So scrumptious.  CPK is not always my first choice because I try to frequent local joints over chains.

55,Eddie J.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,19,,3.0,2016-09-24,"So this place is so much more than a Pizza Parlor. Had dinner recently at CPK and tried the pasta with spinach and asparagus and added grilled chicken. OMG!  The bomb. I've got just one thing that bugs me. They have two waiters in there that have beards. Just so you don't send me a bunch of pissed off responses, I don't have anything against beards. But the one guy pulls his hair back in a knotted mess and he looks like he just crawled out from under a bridge. The other guy wears his neat. If the other guy ever gets assigned to me as a waiter I will request someone new. Most people won't do that---they just won't come back. I think this is negligent on the managements part. The thing is, I feel there is just too big a chance that some of his gross beard hairs could end up in my families food on the way from the kitchen. I'm sure if management reads this they will just scoff at it. That's fine. Free world. Just so you know, I would be equally upset if a girl waitress had a gross head of hair!!  Gotta dock the whole review 1 point for the gross beard.

Our waiter also brought us fresh french bread and olive oil that tasted like it was infused with pesto, yum!

The BBQ, the Sicilian and the Mushroom. In addition we ordered the Kung Pao spaghetti with shrimp. Everything was delicious. I ordered a Beefeater on the rocks as I usually do at a dinner house and was surprised at the generous pour. Our server was so friendly and attentive we all remarked about it and reflected it in his tip. He was one of those servers that took excellent care of you but you hardly noticed his presence.

Ariyah was able to enhance our experience by relating her own as well as previous customer preferences.  Together, we came up with dining choices we would never have thought up on our own.   Ariyah helped turn what could have been a typical dinner out into a truly delightful and fun evening!  Thanks, Ariyah!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-bakersfield,4.24,4.24,4.24,,4.24
