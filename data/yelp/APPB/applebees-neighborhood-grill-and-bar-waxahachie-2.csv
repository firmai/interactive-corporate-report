Wend S.,"Waxahachie, TX",43,77,9,1.0,1/1/2013,Lousy service... Went in had a seat and 5 or so minutes passed and not one server offered us water or even acknowledged that we were there. So we walked out. There are way too many good restaurants that would appreciate our business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2?start=20
Hachie T.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,6,,3.0,6/30/2014,"The food is alright, bar is better. It used to have a good ol small town feel to it. Now it's full of random people and the ""home"" feeling is gone. Management needs to crack down on drunk idiots making asses out of themselves. Glad they still allow smoking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2?start=20
Sith S.,"Dallas, TX",8,43,39,3.0,11/7/2011,"Applebees is a place where u can hang out and have a drink and grab some food, the food is ok! But not that great!

A J.,"Mansfield, TX",0,9,,1.0,10/6/2012,No stars. We were going to eat there but it smelled like a smokey Bolling alley. I didn't want the food I was eating to taste like a ash tray. I,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2?start=20
David T.,"Ennis, TX",3,15,,3.0,6/22/2009,"My wife and I went there for Fathers Day, which was on Sunday afternoon during the Church rush. Even though it was very busy we were seated promptly and our food came out very fast. I was very impressed by the staff and by the quality of the food. Will eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2?start=20
B B.,"Ellis, TX",0,7,,2.0,7/17/2009,"I typically like Applebees in the metropolitan areas, but I couldn't eat in this one because it was too smokey and ""non-smoking"" section is a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2?start=20
Bryan H.,"Dallas, TX",7,6,,4.0,8/21/2017,Food was great service was excellent and friendly.  Food came out nice and hot in about 10 minutes.  My chicken lime dish was the most flavorful chicken I ever had,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Magic M.,"Waxahachie, TX",215,433,2,1.0,4/2/2017,"This was one of the worst dining experiences ever.  Hawaiian drink thing didn't even give me a buzz. Oriental salad was ok but too sweet.  Pork chop was disgusting. Garlic green beans were nasty. Clearly previously frozen.  Sriracha shrimp were ok but not great.  Service was good, no problem.   This confirms my latest suspicion that chain restaurants basically have everything frozen, pre-made, and they just heat it up. Worst $50 spent, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Shirley B.,"Hutchins, TX",0,3,1,1.0,11/7/2017,Ordered Sangria. Was served what tasted like boxed Merlot on ice.  Drinks were comped so there's that. Appetizers and Entree served at the same time. One of my biggest pet peeves. Server kept sitting down to chat with patron at the next table and couldn't even be bothered to bring us more than one napkin each despite being asked for more napkins.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Lesia T.,"DeSoto, TX",16,6,,2.0,6/25/2017,I frequently visit this location but my last visit was not a good one. I noticed the cook come out and visit different tables and inquire if things were ok but he never stopped by to see if I needed anything. Also my server Terri would stop and talk at other guests but not me. I had to beck to get her attention before she walked by my table. Needless to say that I was the only different person there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Casey C.,"Palmer, TX",67,18,,5.0,9/11/2017,"Had their Firecracker Shrimp dish and it was delicious. Our waiter was great too.

Yvo N.,"Veitshöchheim, Germany",0,16,,5.0,11/6/2016,Delicious food. They always checked on us. Very friendly staff. Really loved our waitress. She understood my humor and was very nice and kind!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Josh G.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/19/2017,Only come here for the appetizers and alcohol but those are always on point! Good food and booze and even better people!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Wendy M.,"Red Oak, TX",0,1,1,1.0,12/14/2015,The beer prices were decent however the beer was short served on every beer and every customer. So in essence it's not worth the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Zac S.,"Dallas, TX",257,370,1171,3.0,1/14/2015,"The Riblet Basket was absolutely delicious, much to my astonishment, as well as the Spinach Artichoke Dip. Our server was attentive but not overly annoying pushy. The sweet tea was also tasty and mixed just right, however the bathroom was a horrid display of grotesque uncleanliness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Lou L.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,12,,4.0,5/18/2016,"This was our first visit since they adopted a no smoking policy.  There were three of us and we all got something different, and food was good for all of us.  I had the broiled chicken and it was perfect, and the vegetables were fresh, not previously frozen.  This was not the tv dinner tasting meal I remember from several years before.  The waiter said everything is cooked after ordering.  It did take awhile, but no longer than it took to cook the meal.   The waiter was friendly and kept our drinks filled.  There is only thing that kept this meal from being a 5 star and that is the meal wasn't served with bread.  When I asked if bread came with the meal, the waiter said he would get some, and he came back with one small dinner roll, cut in half, and sprinkled with butter and garlic.  I don't like garlic bread but someone in our group ate it.  When the bill came though, there was a $2 charge for that one small roll. One last, picky thing.  The music was a little too loud to be able to carry on a conversation at the table.  That could be a good thing if you don't want to talk, not so good if you are meeting friends you haven't seen in awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Rachel D.,"Waianae, HI",74,28,81,3.0,9/15/2015,"This Applebee's was a dissapointment. The bathroom needed some attention. Our server was sweet, but at one point was focused on her friends that were visiting. My dinner was mediocre. I was not very impressed with the selection or the quality of the food.  The only highlight of the visit was the Blondie that my boyfriend insisted we ordered. The brownie was good, but the ice cream had slid of and was creating a gooey mess in the dish. Besides the gooey mess it was the best part of the visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Lacy S.,"Venus, TX",0,16,1,1.0,9/11/2016,"Applebee's WUT R U DOING? I'm struggling to find one good thing to say about my trip to this location...The hostess was FAR from inviting, but efficient as far as preforming basic job duty: seating customers. +1 ? Food was terrible. My sampler appetizer tasted like it had sat under a heating lamp all day, lukewarm and oily. My steak ordered medium (and yes, I realize my first mistake was ordering a steak at a crappy, cheesy chain) came out extra well done. I asked for a manager. Twice, actually. She looked over at our table as our server was relaying my request to speak to her, made eye contact more than once, and went about purposely and awkwardly avoiding me. Incredibly odd. Don't worry lady, I wasn't going to ask for you for a thing, if the full, untouched (aside from cutting into the steak) plates weren't enough to prompt you to take action, offer a remake or refund. Keep my money, too many other places in Waxahachie to get a room temperature beer at. Even more that actually serve them cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Jonathan E.,"Arlington, TX",140,240,369,4.0,3/11/2015,"Endless wings on Wed's!  Very worth the $, plus hot fresh fries with every new wing order.  I like the Asian or Chipotle flavors the best.  Tried the fried green beans and WOW, even better then they sound on paper.   The dipping sauce has a hint of lemon and compliments them  welll.   Our server was Danielle and she was the best.  Very at tentative and SUPER friendly.  I will deffinetly ask for her section when I come again.  Wish all our waitress where of her caliber.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Ryne L.,"Red Oak, TX",18,1,,1.0,10/25/2015,The food tasted like it came straight out of a microwave. If you like microwave tasting food this is the place for you! I'll never go back to Applebees even if you paid me,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Bovie J.,"Martinsburg, WV",1,12,5,2.0,4/7/2015,We have never had good service and good food. Either the food is disgusting or the service is nonexistent. The only reason this place is still open is due to the bar staying open so late.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2

Austin C.,"Waxahachie, TX",32,19,1,2.0,2/11/2016,"I usually don't write reviews for chain restaurants but since I was once a regular here and experienced great service, food and atmosphere years ago I feel obliged to. I've been coming to this Applebee's for the last 6 years. The first few years I always felt important, like you're supposed to when dining out. My friends knew if we were going to dine out Applebee's was my go to spot. They didn't understand why but I always told them, I don't come here for the food-I come here for the service. Service nowadays has deteriorated and the last few times I've been it seems like they are understaffed and the employees could careless about serving. I remember always being checked on by our server frequently and the manager would always come by after the meal to check on the experience. Now the manager is no where to be found and doesn't seem to care how the floor is ran. I have seen a couple ladies who have been there for the last few years and they have always done good work but they can't do the job by themselves. Needless to say I will be finding a new go to spot after these last few visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Clayton T.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,93,42,5.0,1/22/2012,"Was in town the other day when my girlfriend and I got hungry. We go out quite a bit but neither of us had been to an Applebee's in years. We walked in for lunch and the dining room seemed about half full. We ordered off the 2 for $20 plus appetizer menu. I just have to pause a minute to say ""wow!"". We go out all the time but never have I ran across such a deal. I'm used to paying $50 or so for both of us per meal. The true question would be whether it was any good or not. The answer... Everything was perfect. Food was awesome and blew way past my expectations for the price. Service was great and the waitress was super nice and attentive. The location was clean and the manager checked up on us. Actually the only downside I saw was that the manager checked up on us 2-3 times. Add to that the waitress checking up on us and it seemed like ever 4 minutes someone was there. Overall I say this place is a great but and we'll probably venture there more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
Renee F.,"Erie, PA",0,9,2,3.0,6/7/2015,"Visiting from out of town (PA). Service was awful. Took forever for the waitress to ask for my drink order. I ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken, it was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waxahachie-2
