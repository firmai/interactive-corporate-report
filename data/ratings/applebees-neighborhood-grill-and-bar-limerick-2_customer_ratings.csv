16,Luke S.,"Collegeville, PA",21,49,2.0,4.0,2013-08-16,"I've been coming to this Applebee's for so long that it's not even really a ""chain"" restaurant to me. It honestly feels more like a hometown haunt, something I think all of the big chains try to achieve. I don't know what it is. I keep waiting for them to disappoint me in some way, being just another ""Crapplebee's"", but they haven't yet.   If you've been to a casual dining establishment before you'll know the menu. But I can't help but add that the staff at this particular location seems to know their stuff. I've been to other Applebee's that where the food wasn't nearly as good, or the service.   This location has served as a go-to place for me for years and likely will for years to come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
20,Eric R.,"Flourtown, PA",8,115,1.0,1.0,2013-10-28,Here Sunday for an early dinner. Had a gift card to use and was in the area with time to kill. My first mistake was ordering a steak. Still not sure what species of meat it was. Spongy and chewy and pretty much unpalatable. Eww ick!  The service was great but the product was terrible. Barely ate. Probably would lose weight If we ate here regularly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2?start=20,,,,,
15,John D.,"Royersford, PA",0,4,5.0,4.0,2013-12-05,"Takeout from 'bees is great!  Yes, I will have a beer while I wait. Thank you. The food, is what it is, but it's consistent. Staff is always nice too.  Half price apps after 9 come in handy on some nights as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
19,Johny G.,"Royersford, PA",46,74,6.0,3.0,2014-02-15,"Good service, convenient location... and that's about it.  Not thrilled with ""riblet"" bones.  Way too pricey for average chain-franchise grub.  Stepson loves the appetizer-trio platter and then more wings with more mozzarella sticks.  No idea where he puts it all.  But my debit card is a whole lot thinner when we waddle out.  Hold the door for your mother, man... jeez!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
21,Bob T.,"Phoenixville, PA",34,4,,3.0,2014-02-21,Wife and I were looking for a quick and easy night out.  Food was really only Ok. The service was good. Wife had creamy parm chicken I had the sirloin.  Wife's was good.  The sirloin a little under cooked and tough.  This is not a steak house.  This is a 1/2 above bar food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2?start=20,,,,,
24,Russelle W.,"Collegeville, PA",43,4,,1.0,2014-06-14,"We will never go back again.  Apps came out with dinner at the same time.  Husband's dinner didn't came out with the rest of the meals.  Waiter said it will be right out.  5 mintutes later he came back and said they had to make more fries.  10 more mintutes and it finally came out.  Well by then, the rest of us were done.  The waiter seemed to have such a chill attitude that he saw nothing wrong with this.  I guess you get what you pay for, it's just fast food with ""table service.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2?start=20,,,,,
23,Dennis P F.,"Norristown, PA",4,9,,4.0,2014-07-18,Apple Bees is a good place to go if you want a quick bite to eat and hang out with friends. Also they have good prices for their meals and appetizers. Good for friends and family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2?start=20,,,,,
18,Julie R.,"Royersford, PA",44,61,2.0,1.0,2014-08-15,Ugh... horrible.  Ordered the kids food with our drinks.  Took 1/2 hour for our meal and by then the kids were finished and restless.  Inexcusable and shame on the managers to not comment on the Yelp reviews!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
17,Jacki D.,"Pottstown, PA",2,59,,1.0,2015-01-17,"I never liked this place, but I thought after many years, I would give it another try.  It seems to be crowded most evenings, especially weekends.  Once again, I just did not care for the food.  It all sounds good on the menu, but then it is just frozen stuff warmed up.  Salad dressing tastes like an average grocery store dressing.  I do not get why people like it.  I guess kids may like their food.  Service is decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
11,Michael T.,"Collegeville, PA",1,7,,2.0,2015-02-01,"My wife, mother-in-law, and I wanted to see what their new pub diet had to offer to we went back after a few months from going there previously. We sat in a booth in the bar area around 3:00pm before the dinner rush. On three separate occasions there were loud outburst from the kitchen, enough to throw us off our conversations. Our waitress took our drink and food order promptly (including an appetizer) and gave some suggestions to my wife. Food came in a normal amount of time but they forgot our appetizer beforehand. They said they'd pack it up for us to go and I thought that they'd at least offer a discount or give it to us for free, no such luck. Food was standard, nothing exciting, just normal mass produced easy meal food. For some reason our waitress was within eyesight of us eating fries one section over from us when she wasn't tending her patrons. Came to check on us once without washing her hands after eating. I was without a beverage (water) for about five minutes and just had to drink some of my wife's drink.  Between the outbursts, the forgotten appetizer, the eating in front of patrons without hand washing, and my empty glass, I remember why we stayed away from Applebee's for so long previously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
14,Rich G.,"Royersford, PA",3,10,,2.0,2015-06-11,Ordered the turkey stacker. One or two slices of cheese and turkey. With lot's of cole slaw.  A waste of money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
10,Paxton M.,"Lancaster, PA",0,2,,5.0,2015-12-23,Hands down my favorite Applebee's location! I come after working most evenings and it's a great experience every single time! The bartenders are great here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
2,Tara Marie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,57,23.0,2.0,2016-01-10,"We have come here about 6 times a year over the last 5 years. We came in on a Sunday night with a gift card we received for Christmas.  The Pros: Great for kids Friendly staff Quick service Reasonable prices and portions on the kids menu The Cons:  Prices have increased, portions have decreased Not vegetarian friendly I always struggle to find meatless salads in restaurants (which really, why is that?). I ordered the Fiesta Chicken Salad and asked for no chicken, and extra toppings instead. I was very surprised at how small it was when it arrived. It is no longer served in a bowl, but on a plate, and it was flat and thin - pretty sparse. I did not see extra toppings. As a matter of fact, I felt there were less toppings than should have been on the salad normally, and it was definitely about 30-40% smaller than the last time I ordered it. I was still hungry after, so I finished my son's grilled cheese from his kids meal.  When the server brought the check I brought up the fact that the salad had been pretty sparse and asked if I could receive a discount since there had been no meat and no extra toppings, and the salad was basically lettuce, a few beans and corn and some tortilla strips. He reluctantly agreed and took $1.50 off the check. I think that salad was actually worth about $6, and I felt ripped off. Especially when my kids got a huge Texas Toast grilled cheese, large sides of fries and apple juice all for $4.99.  It's a good place for kids. Not so great for adults if you don't want a burger or other standard bar food. My husband paid $13 for a pretty sparse shrimp plate as well. I won't eat here again. I'll probably take my kids occasionally if I have a gift card and get some soup or a beer for myself, but I'm not dropping that amount of money for such small portions again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
9,Joshua S.,"Norristown, PA",1,4,,1.0,2016-01-18,"Stopped in with friends and family (6 people, 1 baby).  There wads booth available, but they said they were reserved for parties of 8 or more...and tried to cram us into a small table.  Then they called us ridiculous for requesting the booth instead of the table.  Love Applebee's, but avoid this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
12,David F.,"Royersford, PA",3,35,,1.0,2016-04-19,Came back now no green beans and the pretzels dip was salty and way to much spinach in dip. salmon was better at outback looks like tgi Fridays for crispers,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
13,Brian R.,"Spring City, PA",0,15,1.0,1.0,2016-05-29,Can't believe how bad my service was at this Applebee's. The restaurant was less then half full. The waitress totally forgot our appetizer. I asked her for more dipping sauce and she either forgot or just disregarded it. And food took forever. I'll never go back to this Applebee's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
5,Will S.,"Gwynedd, PA",0,3,,5.0,2016-06-07,"I loved this particular Applebees. I know it's a chain restaurant so they try to keep the food consistent across all branches, but there was something special about this particular Applebees.  The wait staff was very attentive, even on a busy Friday night. Our waitress was very considerate, making sure everything was up to our standards and didn't hesitate when I asked her to mix half Sprite and half Mountain Dew. The white chocolate duck la'range was exquisite. The sea cucumber really complimented the bourbon barbecue sauce on the duck.  The desert was even better than the entreè. We ordered the flaming firecracker sundae. I was surprised when they put a real firecracker on it and lit it in the dining room. I was in awe.  Overall, great experience and would recommend for anyone to visit and enjoy the great food and atmosphere. 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
4,Lauren W.,"Schwenksville, PA",0,5,,2.0,2016-08-25,"Can't get over how bad the service is. Don't even try curbside - impossible to place an order to begin with, wait is forever and you need to go into restaurant to get your order. Sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
6,Will K.,"Royersford, PA",0,5,,4.0,2016-10-14,This Applebees is particularly nice and has very nice food and great service. I love the presto online usage to order my delicious dinner. Thank you Applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
8,Michael B.,"Spring City, PA",279,49,,4.0,2016-12-01,Will start with this is an Applebee's and not a steakhouse. Don't expect gourmet food. That said it's pretty good. Half price appetizer hours are nice. Drinks are on the weak side and beer selection could be better. Try sampling some local brewers on tap.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
7,M W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,122,,4.0,2016-12-30,I was just in recently for dinner and I had a pleasant experience. Minor mess up on my food and the manger was quick to get it fixed. My food was very good and also came out very hot! Our waiter Dave was very kind and he did an awesome job with checking on us and making sure everything was ok. I will definitely return in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
3,Daniel M.,"Schwenksville, PA",0,4,,4.0,2017-01-03,"Like any applebees location the food was damn good. However I issue a warning, if you have the waitress named Juana ask for another, she should be fired, don't take her shit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,,,,,
1,Ashley C.,"Collegeville, PA",47,1,,1.0,2017-07-17,Doubt I will return! Service was horrible. Food arrived okay. Server asked if everything was okay but instead of waiting for an answer walked away. Waiting  10 minutes for a refill when I can see you standing in your service area is not okay! No general awareness of your table is also not Okay! Your table having to get to to ask the host for mustard... yup you got it not okay! This is strike two for this applebees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
0,Carla L.,"Royersford, PA",7,47,141.0,3.0,2017-09-23,Not really what I remember. The menu has changed a bit since the last time I was here. The cooking staff may have too because it just wasn't as appetizing as before. The food was not bad but it wasn't great either. Mediocre at best. However the waitress was fantastic! I wouldn't be opposed to going back and giving them another try in the future. Could have just been an off night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-limerick-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
