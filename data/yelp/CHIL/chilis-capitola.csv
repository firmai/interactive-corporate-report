Terri M.,"Gilroy, CA",34,320,1147,3.0,1/2/2018,"We came here for a quick lunch. It wasn't too busy. In the area we were in there was 3 people seated and I guess they had been waiting for awhile for their order, over 30 minutes, and they still hadn't received anything.  We ordered, I ordered the fajitas with loaded mashed potatoes. My daughter ordered the kids mac n cheese. Then 2 other groups were seated in the same area as us.  Our food came out about 15 minutes later, and the other groups food came out around the same time as ours. But the original group never got their food. The loaded mashed potatoes were the best. I felt so bad for the ladies who had never received their food. They had asked the waitress about 5 times what happened with their food. Two times she said it should have been brought out to them, another she said it was in the back, then she came back saying it was never made. These ladies were there for over an hour and a half. They asked the waitress about getting a gift certificate for having to wait so long and not get anything. I think they should have got a free meal and a gift certificate. But it didn't seem as if they waitress cared about those customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola
Peter L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1085,110,205,2.0,10/1/2017,"I haven't been here for a long time but recently came here for dinner, requested by my nephew. I never come here because the quality of food was never good for me.  It was really busy during dinner so we expected to wait. They seemed understaffed as it took 20 minutes for a server to ask for beverages. Knowing this we had our order ready too.  Food took about 40 minutes to come out and you can tell the cooks in the back were swamped. I don't expect fine dining lol but it was still unacceptable. Food seemed frozen and heated/cooked too fast, vegetables tasted frozen and the steak was overly salty.  Their onion rings were good even with their watery ranch lol. I think I would have to be really wasted to enjoy their food. Although the people next to us had good looking burgers. I think Santa Cruz Diner would have been a better option and that place is pretty bad too. I think it would help to get... More employees to help out. The hosts were running around like headless chickens and bussing too. It was clear the kitchen had too many tickets or just unorganized. The food really reflected it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola
Josh T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,27,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"I knew that we shouldn't have gone to chili's, I knew we would be disappointed but it's the chips and salsa. So we went anyways. Apparently they're doing an on line wait list in addition to the in restaurant waitlist. This translated into an extremely long wait, but you know.... chips and salsa. The two young men who were hosting seemed to be lost in general, like just lost but they were also busing tables so I'm sure that accounted for their general inability to function. Once we finally were seated, the waiter was relatively nice. We ordered 1 order of the ultimate meat meal combo or whatever they call it to share. We had to ask our waiter to go find our order after about 30 minutes. When it arrived, (without the fries initially) it was the saddest food I have ever seen. The corn on the cob was revolting it tasted freezer burnt and whatever they put on it tasted foul. The ribs were worse than usual at chilis, they had been sitting out for awhile, really gross. The chicken crispers were soaked in oil and just gross. The jalapeño cheese sausage was actually not horrible in taste but in looks it's was really bad. When our fries finally showed up they were ok, I mean it pretty hard to screw up fries.  The bill was 31.00 for two sodas, one entree and chips and salsa. The service was abysmal. While I understand that I shouldn't expect too much from a chain restaurant, this place is awful and has gotten worse over the years.  If the owners read these reviews, they really need to reevaluate how their restaurant is running. Also please take my advice, this place gets 2 1/2 stars for a reason! Do not go there! No matter how strong the craving for chips and salsa is! The service is horrible and no one who is there is happy, you will leave bloated and disappointed at how much you spent for the crap you got.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola
Andrina D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Awful service - Wait - NO SERVICE.  I went here at 7:15pm on 1/4/18 for dinner.  We were seated in about 5 minutes. Restaurants had maybe 5 groups max. We were given menus by the hostess and that is the last we saw of any staff.  We waited until 7:48pm and we finally left. The servers were all there and did not acknowledge us at all.  No offer to take drink orders; no hello; NOTHING.  I know this service at this place is bad, but it has never been this bad.  A waste of 33+ minutes of my life.  I will never return.  Ironically as we left, the hostess said ""have a nice evening"".  How Ironic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola

We got the only table available, it was so dirty, I bartender said someone would be with us shortly, they never came to clean the table let alone serve us. We left, went to another place and gladly handed over sixty five for the meal and a twenty percent tip. Do not go to chilis, service is horrible at the mall. My wife called the manager, he said we have systems in place, we should not have received such horrible service.

Stephanie S.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Arrived today for lunch, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. Finally ordered drinks and chips and waitress said she'd be right back to take our order- she literally never came back. We waited about 45 minutes, as we were eating chips, but finally just paid for what we had and left. People around us were leaving after being seated because no one ever showed up to even take their drink order. Really, really bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola
Wendy P.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",2,2,,1.0,10/30/2017,We went to Chili's since they say that there is a new menu. We ordered the steak fajitas and a chicken salad. The fajitas came out and the steak was two different temperatures. The side of rice was cold like it came just from the fridge. Then there was hair in the salad. The service is tolerable and probably adequate considering that they were busy on a Monday. But we waited a long time for our order and then for our waitress to come check on us. She actually walked past at least five times maybe more looked directly at me and kept walking. The Ziosk device also wasn't functioning so we couldn't even request the waitress to come. I don't think that we will ever come back again. I can say one mistake could happen but for both of us to have separate issues with our food and a lack of response from the staff it is something that turns you off to a restaurant forever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola
Lorena F.,"Watsonville, CA",0,28,7,1.0,11/2/2017,"This place is a total joke. I went in around 2:40 and it took them 30 min to make a grill cheese and fries for my client, I'm there sitting and waiting, looked around and restaurant was almost empty. All my client and I would hear was a lady screaming in the kitchen.... mi client has special needs and was scared because she thought someone was fighting, she got up and looked inside the kitchen. It was a lady named Valerie super loud mouth. Even though my food was never brought out they still charged me my freaking soda. Such bad customer service, as much as my client loves this place , I will NEVER VISIT THIS Chilis location anymore. Also kitchen people had loud music, sounded like a party in the kitchen. They don't take care of customers. Soo sad!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola

Brianna G.,"Watsonville, CA",40,4,1,1.0,10/22/2017,"We used to come to chilis all the time and we LOVED IT! However, our last encounter (Fri, Oct 20th) will be the absolute last time we come. We are also currently disputing charges with out bank. We came in and sat down at a bar table, waited for someone to come to our table for 15 minutes...even though a female waitress in the bar walked passed us 3 times without acknowledging us. The restaurant was steady but by no means slammed. Finally a big jersey shore looking dude came up to us and took our order. About 15 minutes later, our food was brought to us by a food runner who dumped and ran... and we still had not received our beers (which had been sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes ready for jersey boy to bring it to us). I had to walk up to the bartender and ask him to hand me our beers. We finished our beer and our food, at this point our server hadn't even come to ask us how our food was/clear a plate/refresh drinks..NOTHING, even though he was walking by to other tables. I walked over to the host station got a manager and expressed how disappointed we were with the visit. I told him I wanted nothing out of it, but thought he should know as we were frequent, long time customers and this is not how this place normally operates. He apologized, and said he would adjust our bill and talk with the waiter after we left. We pay our bill over the little electronic device and the manager had taken off our beers for our trouble. We left our waiter a $0 tip, as that was what he deserved for the 0 service we got (and I have never done that). This morning I logged into my bank account online to find our server added himself in a $4 tip. I will be calling Chili's when they open today, and going into my bank tomorrow morning to dispute the charges. I am shocked and they have lost a customer for life at this location. And, if you're reading this Jersey boy, choose a new profession...you're a terrible waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola

Josie L.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,3.0,4/6/2017,"3 stars because when I came to eat in the bar area, the service was pretty good and attentive. I ordered the Texas cheese fries and they were so good! My boyfriend knew the bartender and she was very helpful. However, when I ordered a to go order a few days later, the girl taking our order did not know how. We had to repeat our order 3 times and she read it back to us exactly how we said it and it was still very wrong. It was my mistake not double checking the order when I picked it up. We wanted the burger to come with onion rings, but it came with fries. We wanted a burger with only bacon and cheese and there was other stuff in it.  Seems to be inconsistent.  When they get your order right though, it's delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=20
charlie s.,"Santa Cruz, CA",106,10,3,1.0,12/22/2016,"Well my son and I went in for dinner then Christmas shopping! The service was awesome! Now Jake and I got this smoke house plate thing for $14.99. With chicken strips and some ribs and random sides. The ribs amazing my 9 year old loved them  due to his chicken being cold and not crispy. So i asked the kid if he wants to take the chicken home ""NO"" at this time I realized how bad the chicken was. We told the waitress about she said manager will be right over... We waited and waited and waited  finaly. Casey Armbruster showed up with her splendid attitude  (don't think she should be in customer service) and said ""You want two free strips or pay the bill"" Two strips would have been grate 20 min ago but my kid ate my meal so he is not hungry now..... I asked for couple bucks off.....Casey Armbruster no and walked off. So I paid the bill and left. NO SORRY NOTHING JUST ATTITUDE!

Kit B.,"Serra Highlands, South San Francisco, CA",17,23,1,2.0,10/30/2017,"This place has really gone downhill. My family used to go here pretty often because the food was inexpensive & good. But this last visit was just a disappointment. There were so many dirty tables & nobody was bussing them. So we sat at one of there few empty/clean tables. Our server took our orders pretty quickly but the quality of the food was the disappointment. The salad I got had brown lettuce & you could tell it had been sitting out for a while. We also ordered a burger that was 80% grease which I later learned means that they don't clean their grill.

Eric P.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/30/2017,We used to enjoy going here but our last experience reminded me of eating pre-packaged food straight out of a microwave. The cajun chicken pasta was awful! The chicken had no browning and no spice whatsoever. I certainly hope they step up their game in the kitchen.

Meat was not memorable... Yuk.  Tea was good and so was lemonade our server never let our drink go empty.

The guacamole was horrible, the guacamole was black! We couldn't believe that our waiter had just given us that. We told him the guacamole was black and said he would replace it with a new one, which he did. Now, both of our food was served on a TRAY, not on a plate, but actual metallic tray. Wth? I noticed other people's foods were served on an actual plate. The chicken tasted awful, it was undercooked! The fries were so cold! The mashed potatoes I ordered were so awful, they were so cold! Needless to say, the food was horrible and I had to flag down other waiters so I could be given a knife to cut into my chicken crispers!! Oh and my fork was given to me in a paper bag?! Wth?!

I was literally watching one of the hosts moving dirty dishes from one table to another I was like bro really. I'm assuming that they are hiring for bussers cause obviously they had none. The host went to sit some people at a table and the lady told him oh it's dirty over here too. When we were getting seated the host looked at the table and then realized it was still a little dirty and kept walking. Then we got sat in the very back corner surrounded by dirty tables. And it was a Tuesday night so it wasn't packed. Maybe because management wasn't there or they obviously didn't care to come out and help their employees. The host was a sweet guy and all, so was our waiter but the atmosphere wasn't the best.

HORRIBLE!!! The brocoli was even over cooked , who messes broccoli up!!! The sirloins steaks were extremely small looked like a 2oz instead of a 6oz ( I even have pictures to prove it) . The worse part of it was that after we spoke to the manager about it he said he would compensate our meals and admitted that a new cook was not properly cooking the food.  He only had a small portion of the meal compensated!!!  My partner was very upset and even asked the manager for a beer and never received it then we see the manager just laughing chatting with Other employees. I cant believe that a manager knowing that a customer is upset with the food  and service would prolong getting them a drink or making their experince more pleasant. I manage a company myself and never would I ever not take care of an unsatisfied customer that brings business to my company!! I can honestly say that I will no longer  be visiting or eating at ANY chilis restaurant EVER!!! I will definitely share my experience with every person I know and ever meet about this horrible experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=40
Dawn H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",116,26,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Firstly, the service was great. Crystal (I think - I had to call to check who was serving the bar so I could write this - Kim answered the phone and was bubbly and pleasant, by the way) was very likable and timely and great. Nothing that happened was her fault. I wish i had more cash to leave her at the end, because I know what it's like to have my tips suffer due to crap cooking and management. Chili's had pretty much lost us as customers due to so many horrible experiences and food issues. But we tried again, and they had made such fabulous changes to the menu - even little tablets at the tables for games and payment - just great! New menu items seemed pretty good so we've gone back a few times in the last few months. Too good to be true? Unfortunately, yes.  My sirloin/avocado dish was great - cooked medium rare like i requested. my boyfriend's (contrary to what we initially thought at first cut, as the manager did actually ask us to check before he left the steaks with us, which was nice - too bad we didn't notice right away...it was obviously not medium rare but it looked bearable at first) was medium well, almost well.  whoops, our bad, we didn't notice right away. but no, this was NOT anywhere near medium rare. server does the right thing and brings out a little plate to take the steak and not the whole meal.  A medium rare steak simply doesn't take long. and we were willing to be totally content if the new one came out right....or even close to right.  so we wait. and wait. and get more drinks. and wait. two steaks walk right by us. same kind as he ordered.....they had CLEARLY been put on the fire long after we sent the steak back. That is unacceptable. Our replacement steak should have been priority. So i am eating super slowly and trying to get my bf to share my steak so he can enjoy his dinner. he had a few pieces, but by now his potatoes and broccoli are ice cold. We saw our server trying to get the new steak from the cooks and manager multiple times. She never lost sight of the dilemma. Finally, she brings us a replacement and asked us to check it (looking nervous) - honestly you could SEE it was almost well-done. way too firm. Sure enough, it was WORSE than the first. Unbelievable.... So at this point we're just over it - bf doesn't want to wait anymore. So basically our entire meal was ruined.  I am WELL versed in corporate restaurant protocol for unhappy patrons, particularly when it was due to a restaurant screwup. Both meals should have come off the bill at the VERY LEAST. I am willing to pay for my bar tab, however. That I can understand. Crystal (who is totally stuck under that management thumb since she has to wait for them to void things - ugh I don't miss that frustration) is of course apologetic and brings our bill, which only has his meal taken off.  She tells us the manager will be over to speak with us. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And he does come over to the bar to do something but on his way back past us I said ""whoa whoa "" and he turns, looks at me (full eye contact and irritated look!) and turns and walks briskly away. Purposefully. (this is when i decide that infuriated yelping will be in my immediate future) I didn't catch the manager's name, but apparently it was either James or Mario (like I said, I called the front desk to find out who I had dealt with and there were two managers on duty. For what it's worth, this one was dark hair, bigger dude. Not much to go on there) So we do something I NEVER DO. We scrounge for cash for a decent tip and left only money for the bar tab. I wrote a note on the tab and talked to the server, making sure she wouldn't get screwed if we did this. Normally the only recourse a patron has is to punish the server, but she had been wonderful, and done all she could do. I watched her try to remedy the trainwreck. And for us to pay for my meal basically does not bring consequences to the (lack of) management.  Like I said, I know corporate restaurant policy, and in this instance, we should AT LEAST not have been charged for food. Simply removing a meal that never got served is not enough. BOTH of our experiences were ruined, and you can BET I am gonna tell the world. If the manager had just done the right thing, or at least acknowledged our presence, I may have let it fly.  They were not THAT crazed, just a mild Sat night. Normal night for a mall restaurant. There were two managers on duty. We were served leather twice. In an untimely manner. With no management contact after the fact.  My LORDY they need better management. Or to retrain the angry bub. That was a completely avoidable sequence of events. I feel terrible for the servers that have to bust their ass under that kind of non-supportive misled management. Their tips will suffer when average patrons don't know where to lay the proper blame. I loved my food, and was excited to find a new favorite I could hopefully count on. But I doubt we will go back now. So that's lame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=40

I was craving margaritas, and made my mom think that she wanted one too.  As I didn't feel like going down to the village, we came here.  It was Saturday night, during the rush, but the wait wasn't that bad.  The hostesses were as nice as hostesses could be in such a situation (putting up with disgruntled mall shoppers), and we were sat fairly quickly. Personality-wise, our server was great- attentive, on-time (although she asked us if we were ready to order as soon as we sat down, which is not really possible), and was clearly not jaded as a waitress- yet.  I ordered the buffalo chicken salad (or whatever it was called), and they didn't have that type of chicken.  Huh?  They had boneless buffalo wings, but they didn't have buffalo chicken tenders?  How hard is it to substitute?  Anyway, after I pointed it out, she said it could be done, so I got it with some modifications.  Which she wrote down.   So our food came out- my mom's was mostly correct, as was mine.  I just wanted diced tomatoes instead of pico de gallo, and nary was a little red tidbit to be found.

Called in at 6pm, said they had some open tables for a family of four.  Arrived and no hostess by the entrance for a good 5 minutes. Finally got seated by a waitress who cares enough to explain the new ziosk technology they have - it's like a mini screen on every table that customers can use to refill/re-order their drinks, pay their bills, etc... Our waiter Isaac came by to let us know he'll be with us in a few minutes (polite of him to communicate despite how busy he was).  By the time he got to us, he promptly took our orders and kept checking back on us frequently (almost every time he passed by our table on his way to other people's).  He'd come to check up on our drinks, refills on appetizer chips, and if we needed anything at all. The line by the door got longer & the restaurant was getting busier but Isaac stayed on top of his customers and was always attentive & kind-mannered. The other waitresses next to our table were very pleasant and patient too. The food was amazing despite the franchise. We got the 2 for $20. The original BBQ baby back ribs were moist & well-seasoned. Hubby had the chicken fajitas and loved the grilled white meat and mini salad bar rack that it came with. This restaurant is quite kid & family-friendly. They had tons of crayon kits for the kids, ziosk had $0.99 game apps to keep anyone entertained, TV mounted throughout for the hubbies to enjoy, and delicious food choices for all.  I've been to other Chili's before and their ribs are usually dry & overcooked and service is usually inconsistent, but this particular location has it down to a science! They even have a quick 5-question survey on the ziosk to ask how your dining experience was - that shows us how much they care about their service. Great job, Chili's management.

Second, my wife's silverware was dirty and  had to be replaced; thirdly,  our water had a funky aftertaste reminiscent of old dishwater.  Finally, after a long wait, our entrees appeared (chicken tacos).   The chicken was barely warm, way too salty, and tasted like cat food.

We got the chips and salsa as an appetizer which took us another 20 minutes. When we said something about it we just kept getting a ""they will be right out"" by the time we got those we waited another 30 minutes until we got our food. And because we waited so long we just getting refills on our chips and started getting full on that. we got the food and it was extremely cold and overly salted. But we could never find the waitress to get our refills and when we'd try flagging down the manager he would say he'd be right with us but never showed back up. Finally after what seemed like an eternity our waitress came dropped off the check and just disappeared all over again. Because you pay at the machine with a card we never seen her again.

But the wait was only 15 minutes, or so the hostess said. I don't know because when it gets busy like that, we just go to the bar area and grab ourselves a seat You are served just the same as the regular dining area with even the same menu. However the hostess made a mistake in telling us that it was happy hour. We found out after our bill arrived that she was in fact mistaken since happy hours aren't on Saturdays. The ambiance was typical loud on a Saturday night. I ordered the half rack of ribs and the salmon filet. To my surprise, the salmon was seasoned just right, and was cooked well too, not dry at all.  My wife had the mushroom burger, and she really enjoyed her burger. She said it was juicy and flavorful and quite hearty. You can't ask for much more from a chain restaurant.

I didn't ask for a manager because I was so frustrated and she didn't seem concerned. I will eventually go back but it will be a little while. I am hoping it was just an off day for the staff.

jeff m.,"Santa Cruz, CA",3,32,,2.0,1/23/2013,"Went to lunch there today 01-23-13. Taking the wife to lunch as we were doing errands. I suggested Chili's because of all the times I've gone to them. From Carmel to San Francisco, they've always been good. The Chili's at 1855 41st Ave, Capitola, is not one of those aforementioned Cili's I've experienced. As a fact, this restaurant experience was one of the worst ones ever! The service is good, I guess?  When we ordered our drinks, the coffee the wife ordered was served in a dirty cup. When unwrapping the napkin that held the silverware for my place, it was dirty. Of course the server brought us clean utensils & coffee served in a clean cup; should have walked out then? When we got our orders; the combos with soup an sandwich; the soup was cold. We asked the server to warm it up & when she came back, it was still cold. The next time an individual came out, it was the manager. She brought our soups heated to the degree that we were happy with, but had added bacon that we didn't want or ask for. At this point we just held back & removed the bacon.  The grilled sandwiches were good; cooked good. The back chatter of the supervisor critiquing the host, didn't make up for the fact that the building was cold. The waitperson did offer to give us dessert; whoopee. My wife kept talking to the person in her friendly consoling tone, which I admit was getting to me. I just wanted out of there & at that point, I know these people don't have a clue & I will never go back there.    It soured the rest of the day. I think headquarters needs to come to that particular restaurant & pave the policy for them, because if it has to rely on its own for conducting business, they'll lose. I've lived in the area since 1965 & the restaurants that I've gone to that were in that poor of operation, are only memories, that I couldn't tell you the name of.

Back to more important things!!! What to order, hmmm.... Very briefly scan the ""guiltless"" section of the menu, shake myself back to reality, and focus my attention on the only two sections of the chili's menu worth ever ordering from. Burgers and fajitas, baby! Deciding to be adventurous, I steer away from my usual steak fajitas cadillac style, and opt for the mushroom jack chicken fajitas. Boy, was that a mistake. The food arrives, my mom's 5 minutes before mine, I look at my fajitas and back to the waiter - -  Me: ""But, I ordered the mushroom jack fajitas..."" Alex: ""Oh yea, those are the mushroom jack fajitas, just without the mushrooms."" (As if that is completely normal) Me: ""Um, yes, and the Jack... and the mushroom jack fajitas come with chicken, there is half chicken and half steak here. Kinda had my heart set on those mushrooms too."" Alex: ""No, the mushroom jack fajitas come with both chicken and steak."" (Silently grab a menu, open it, and point to where under Mushroom Jack Fajitas it says CHICKEN! There is no mention of steak.) Alex: ""Oh, well, it would take a really long time to cook the whole thing over again, and I can see that your mom is already halfway threw her meal... so why don't I just fix the mushroom jack part for you."" Me: ""Fine, whatever."" (Alex returns with a plate of mushrooms and cold jack cheese) Me: ""Really? Isn't it supposed to be melted over the top of the meat?"" Alex: ""Well yea, normally, but that would take a long time."" Me: (Restraining myself from jumping over the table and strangling this asshole) ""Okay, I think I can afford that kind of time."" (Alex takes my plate away with a serious attitude. Did this guy's boyfriend just break up with him or is he simply the worst waiter to ever serve a table? He comes back 2 minutes later with my half ass melted cheese fajitas. Decide it's not worth battling anymore over and say thank you.) Plow through my cold mediocre fajitas (extremely disappointed, they are usually so good!) because I am seriously famished by this point. Alex had been ignoring us during this time, thank god, but then he dropped in for his finale - - abruptly bursting out with ""Am I annoying you yet? Because I can get really annoying."" Me: (Outloud) ""No, can we please have our check."" (In my head) ""How did you ever become a waiter and how have you not been fired yet?""

I havent been to the Capitola Mall in years but didnt think much would have changed-- I was wrong!  A friend and I decided to swing by here for a quick bite to eat, I much prefer Chili's to Applebees. Anyway, we get seated right away by the hostess who leaves us menus and tells us that our waiter would be with us shortly. The menus were sticky and had gunk on them. Yuck! Our server Alex came over to take our drink orders within a few minutes and everything seemed OK til I noticed the silverware-- it still had leftover food on them, needless to say we didnt use them.  We decided to try the 2 for $20 meal and decided to go with the Skillet Queso which surprisingly wasnt bad and they gave us plenty of tortilla chips!!  For our entrees we had a bacon cheeseburger and an Old Timer w/Cheese, pretty simple, right? When the food arrived I couldnt help but notice how sloppily it was put together, the meat on the burger was practically falling apart and the bread was a little soggy from the juice of the jalapenos that they put on top of the garnishes-- I didnt ask for them, in fact I dont like them! I asked Alex if he could bring me some mayo and my friend needed a refill and he his response was sure, no problem-- 20 minutes later he finally shows up with the refill but said he forgot the mayo by that time I was already half way through my burger.

We didn't even see him anywhere, so my husband flagged one of the bussers and asked her to find our waiter. Another five minutes passed before he finally came to take our order. He apologized and said he had been ""running all over the place"" (which I assume means he was working in other areas of the restaurant as well as our table).

We waited for about five minutes just for a hostess to show up even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. Upon being seated, I ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla as per usual and was brought out the completely wrong quesadilla that I did not order. When I informed the server of the mistake, she said she would gladly take care of it. However, she came back with which I believed to be the same exact quesadilla. The only difference was that bacon bits seemed to have been just thrown onto the quesadilla in a futile attempt to disguise the fact that this was the same quesadilla from before. In addition, our waitress was not attentive and came back with requests for more ranch and napkins after we had already finished our meal. I'm not sure if it was because she seemed to have a lot of other tables at the time, but I don't believe that is any excuse to provide poor service to guests. She tried to make up for this by being extremely friendly when she was paying attention to us, which one of my friends then reminded me that we had ""come to eat, not to be her friend"". Wise words. Also, I  visited this location last summer with my family and the hostess sat us in a closed section without informing a server, causing us to wait for about fifteen minutes before any one approached us. I probably will not be visiting this location again. I believe that management needs to do a better job in training their employees on the basics of communication, hospitality, and service.

Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,3.0,12/20/2012,I used to think Chili's had decent steaks but I either changed my tastes or they went down hill because the steak was pretty bad. Still they have mostly fair prices and it can be fun to overeat and over drink now and then I suppose.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120
April S.,"Watsonville, CA",1,6,,2.0,3/19/2012,"Great place to go when you literally have all day....service is VERY slow, even when there are only a couple tables being served.  I've gone a couple times on my lunch and always get back late (even after letting them know I'm short on time because I'm on lunch). Last time I was there I had 40 minutes for lunch and the place was empty, only 2 other tables being served and all I ordered was an appetizer which took about 20-25 minutes to get to me and by that time the fries and cheese were almost cold so must have been sitting there for a while before my waitress bothered to bring it out to me, then I asked for a side of jalapenos and as I waited I watched my waitress go to her other 2 tables and pick up plates and come in and out of the kitchen WITHOUT my jalapens...finally when she walked past my table I asked her again for my jalapenos and she had totally forgot about me asking for them the first time!!! I'd be a little more understanding if it was crazy busy but I mean, COME ON!!   Food is what you'd expect, drinks are pretty good, waiters have all been pretty friendly just don't have a sense of urgency.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120
Aarash Z.,"Richmond, CA",409,324,9,4.0,9/22/2012,"It's been a while since I had been to Chili's, but one of the good things about chains is for better or worse, they will always taste the same... luckily, this time it was for the better... for what it is, Chili's is pretty good. the southwest eggrolls were tasty, good queso, nice fruity drinks, and the baby back ribs... they always made good ribs... i wish i could give Chili's 3.5 stars... but since our waiter was new, and overly courteous and attentive because he was scared he'd get complained about, i'll give them 4 :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120
Christa P.,"San Francisco, CA",100,11,11,4.0,12/8/2010,"Best thing at Chili's: The Margaritas.  They have a wide variety of drinks, but my favorite has to be the House Margarita. The food there is pretty tasty. They definitely have a lot to choose from, and it comes in big portions. I really like their Fajitas and Bottomless Chips! A little on the pricey side though.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120
vincent C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,23,,1.0,9/26/2012,"You know how you tell yourself that the last visit (which was less than satisfying) may have just been your mood or taste at the time? (That's why Andrew Zimmern tries stuff twice, btw). Well, I thought I'd try Chilis in Santa Cruz (41st Ave) one more time to see if it was just me. Let me take this opportunity to tell you, its not just me. After taking forever to get seated, the plastic and dissatisfying food, mediocre service and a general lack of fun atmosphere contributed to a terrible overall experience and my subsequent one star rating. My advice : Go somewhere, anywhere other than this Chili's....this place is terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120
Kenny P.,"San Jose, CA",660,881,2500,3.0,11/14/2009,"Something about this Chilis location bothers me, it maybe the old feeling C grade mall that it's connected to.  Or the small size of the restaurant, the missing patrons bustling around that you might find at other locations.   It seems like the perfect place that you might have to deal with some B.S. from a server or even a fellow customer for that matter.  A weak Chili's location, but still deserving of 3 stars because their food was alright.   A couple days of partying at a rented beach house in Capitola was the only reason why I been dragged to this dull place.  Clearly not a memorable Chili's location to eat at, and probably the lowest rating I will give a Chili's.  Hopefully I won't be back here for many years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120
Franzin C.,"Union City, CA",61,19,14,2.0,1/14/2015,"I went here the other night just for a bite to eat. I the service wasn't completely horrible. Actually I our server was actually a Nice guy. Very straight forward not so personal. Anyways! My girlfriend and I had the 2 for $20 deal because it's a great deal so why not. We went with the half order of Texas fries as an appetizer and well. It was quite horrible to be honest. The fries we cold and stale and the cheese was already cooled down and hard. I don't know if it was just waiting in the window forever or it belonged to someone else earlier and they just decided to reuse it. Oh well I wasn't too concerned at the time. My girlfriend had the mango tilapia? Well yeah. That was good I had a few bite off of it and I wished I had that too because I ordered the chicken crisps with honey chipotle. I enjoyed it, my crisps were warm and I like the sauce. All up until I realized I didn't ask for a long hair down my throat. I was completely disgusted and had lost my appetite. My server was sorry about it and got It discounted off my meal. But yeah. That was dinner people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120
D W.,"Daly City, CA",11,75,,4.0,4/18/2009,i really like this place even though it's a chain.  i can always find something pretty tasty here.  good variety.  reasonably priced.  their dishes are huge and they have a full bar.  what more can you ask for?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=180
Ana O.,"Citrus Heights, CA",43,16,,4.0,7/30/2007,"So this Chili's has its up and downs. Its crowded and there is a long wait if you are there during the weekends, BUT Im writting this review based on my expereince there on a weekday in the evening. Met up at Chilis for drinks with some friends. Quickly found a table in the bar section. Our waitress was prompt and had a cheery personality. I was still in the mood for food so I had their Shanghi chicken. Sauce was a bit too thick but otherwise worked well with our drinks. Always order a Jamaican Paradise when Im at Chili's. Nice blend of everything and it always seems that by the time im 3/4 of the way done with the first drink im so much happier to be there and ready for another drink. We spent about 3hrs at our table, just chitchatting and venting (work). What was great was that we were never rushed our waiter (by this time or original waitress had gone home already) was full of laughs and had all of us laughing as he tried new ways to get us to order more drinks. Overall a great exprerince. Will definetly look to go back during the evening weekdays when the staff is relaxed and you can sit and enjoy some quality time with friends",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=180
