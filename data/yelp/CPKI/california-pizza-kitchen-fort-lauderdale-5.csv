Amanda M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",354,133,236,5.0,12/17/2017,"We had some coupons to use and came here for lunch yesterday. Neither of us had been to a CPK in years but it was so good! I don't know why we never come.  I ordered the bahn mi bowl with shrimp and my boyfriend was struggling to decide between shrimp scampi and the carne asada pizza and the server told us he could do half and half; great!  My bowl was so good. Very fresh, lots of flavor and beautiful presentation. The shrimp scampi part of my boyfriend's pizza was amazing. The flavor was perfect, I loved the arugula on top, and the crust was nice and crispy.  For appetizer we got the charred shishito peppers, which again, did not disappoint. The sauce was delicious, I kept dipping my bread in it rather than the olive oil and herbs.  The service was very good. Our waitress was so nice and helpful. Another good point was the cleanliness of the restaurant. It was nice and bright and everything very clean.  I definitely will be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5
Mike H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,18,11,1.0,9/16/2017,"We were looking forward to eating some CPK so we drive over there in rush hour to eat. Anyway we get seated our waiter I believe his name was angel came by and was completely rude and sounded kind of pissed that he had to take a table. He gets our drink order comes back with our drinks and that's the last time we saw him. We waited for about 15 minutes and no one else came by, we just sat there waiting. So I go to the hostess and asked her if we could get a new waiter since we haven't even seen ours in over 15 minutes. She tells me she thinks Angel was our waiter but he left. I don't understand how you can take a table knowing you're about to get off and not tell anybody. That just seems ridiculous and ridiculously rude on top of that. We go to this California pizza kitchen all the time and to get this kind of service is crazy. So the hostess goes to get us a new waiter and it's not her fault she just walked in as I was telling her this but again we wait another 5-6 minutes and no one comes by meanwhile people are getting seated people that  got there after us are getting their food and we're still sitting there starving with no one coming to us. Absolutely absurd. The lack of service in this place today was awful. The hostess was really trying I could tell but everything else was a far cry from awful. Worst visit I've ever had!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5
Howard G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",161,114,118,5.0,8/7/2017,"We eat at CPK at least twice a month and I always crave their Thai Chicken Pizza. We have tried it at other restaurants, but it is never as good as CPK. I also love the salads and szechuan dumplings.  The bar area and total remodel a few years ago really gave the atmosphere a needed boost. Our server was friendly, checked back several times and everything was delicious.

Kimberly D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",522,362,1188,3.0,11/9/2016,"CPK is a decent chain restaurant easily accessible on Federal Highway.  It's not my favorite pizza place, but it satisfies.  The inside is modern looking, and they have a full service bar, which I didn't remember them ever having, but it's a place for kids and adults alike. I went here late on a weekday night. The place wasn't necessarily busy, but it felt like I waited a while for my single pizza order. The servers are nice, but didn't tend to us very often. I ordered the MUSHROOM PEPPERONI SAUSAGE pizza: Cremini mushrooms, rustic pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, fresh torn basil, Mozzarella and wild Greek oregano.  It has a LOT of mushrooms on it, so if you don't like the flavor, this goes heavy handed.  The spicy sausage is quite spicy... but overall, I enjoyed my pizza very much. It's a solid choice if you're visiting the area and want to stay with the familiarity of a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5
Robert S.,"Providence, RI",122,1126,804,2.0,3/9/2017,"Our friends took us to this CPK for dinner and the food was good...but the service was not. Food:   I got the Chicken Lettuce Wraps.   Good, not as good as PF Chang's but not bad...on the oily side....the lettuce leaves are not as good, concave nor crisp as the ones at PF Chang's but not bad.   My BF got the Bianco Flatbread pizza and it was good.   I had a slice of the thin crisp pepperoni pizza.   Good too.... Service:  The waitress seemed overwhelmed....she got our order wrong....she brought our two dinners, but she messed up the order for our friends Bob and Cori, so they had to take them back and make them again.     This is the same restaurant that did not credit the rewards points on a previous dining experience and after more than 7 days...where they keep saying they will fix it....they have not yet fixed the issue. Training and development needs to be improved at this location.....even though the food is good, people will get tired of mediocre service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5

Van G.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",115,77,167,5.0,9/14/2016,"One of the main requirements from restaurants when I go out is to not just to be a place to eat, but for the interior to be so cozy, so after walking in the first thing mind on my mind would be ""Oh, this is the place where I would like to hang out for an hour"". This California Pizza Kitchen location is one of those places. I came in for lunch and ordereded my favorites: grilled veggie salad with California Pizza and split two soup.  Quiet ambience , comfortable booth , smiley waitress, tasty food that came in about 20 minutes. What can I say, I think it was a pretty successful and tasty lunch. Thanks CPK.

Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1412,6952,5.0,2/20/2016,"California Pizza Kitchen or CPK as most people refer to it as it way more than just an average pizza shop. The inside was much larger than I remembered. Off to the right is a decent-sized bar which we sat at while we waited for our table. Had a few beers (Blue Moon's). Beer was good. Fresh keg. I ordered the Hawaiian which was great. Fresh pineapple and ham. Delicious. OH and the bread they give you before is amazing. You have to eat it. You have to ask for more. Dip it in the vinegar and oil- you must! You must! We had the red and white sangria. My favorite was the red- the white was too sweet for me. Dessert was the butter cake. Wanna know what heaven is like- try the butter cake. There is no other way to describe the feeling you feel when you bite into that warm cake mixed with the cold vanilla ice cream. Shout out to our waitress Ellen who was a true rock star. Our cups were never empty. Our plates were always taken from us when we were finished. She was super friendly, helpful, and efficient. Ask to sit in her section for sure. I know I will next time I'm there. I'm very happy with the food and the service I received here.The staff was friendly, the food was great and the atmosphere is chill- it's definitely not your run-of-the-mill pizza joint. You can bring a date, watch the game or anything else. I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5

The last three times the dishes were dirty. the soup was burnt twice. The food was not consistent. We have been eating here for 10 years. It is very disappointing. Does anyone know if management changed? Update 5/29/17: about 3 weeks ago someone from CPK reached out to see if they could give me a call to talk about the bad experiences lately.

Roy H.,,22,100,19,2.0,8/16/2017,Thin crust pizza is just the right amount of thinness and crisp but because it's the same amount of dough spread thinner it comes out lacking enough sauce to make up for the larger circumference.

There service is very good compare to other restaurants I been to also the manager goes up personally to every table to ask how's everyone food so far and how have you been treated at the time being, very few restaurants do that now a days. They really seem to care for there customer service which they impressed me the most most.  The food was excellent my wife and I ordered the 5 cheese pizza with an order of Mahi tacos and that left me a good taste in my mouth. They have the coldest beers around town that's for sure not only the beer is ice cold with a bit of frost but the glass they give you to pour it in has to be at least  below freezing point which is wonderful to enjoy a ice cold beer with your meal.

Samantha D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",250,344,14723,4.0,5/22/2015,"Being that we are not big fans of going to chain restaurants we love coming to this CPK! The restaurant is very clean and spacious and has tons of seating. Walking in you are greeted immediately and the staff always has a smile on their face! We love the bar section as it is separated from the rest of the restaurant and feels like a lounge. They have table seating as well as bar seating up there and it is right off of their patio.  Both times we have visited Nix has been our awesome bartender! I can not say enough about him and how personable he is. He is over the top accommodating and has no problem going above and beyond for you! This being said we always have such a great time visiting with him during our stay and he actually remembered us from our first visit over 5 months ago! All of the staff at this CPK are extremely friendly and welcoming as a matter of fact!  The main reason we come is for their Happy Hour that is Monday-Friday 3-6pm at the bar with special offerings such as $4 select Draft and Bottled Beers, $6 Margaritas and Mojitos, and $5  Premium Well Drinks. Which their Premium Wells actually are not bad! They also offer a few appetizers on HH such as White Corn and Guacamole with Chips for $3 and a Spicy Chicken Quesadilla for $4. See pictures below for full HH Menu! The bar area also has big TV's for those sport watchers!  We have tried a couple of their food items and have not been disappointed. The food always comes out hot and fresh and of course Nix makes sure we are satisfied with everything!  Overall, we always have such a great time coming here and leave happy!

Kay L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9,7,,2.0,10/1/2017,"My fiancé suggested we go to Lunchbox, but I said no let's go to CPK because I haven't been there in a while. I ordered a salad and it came out with only half of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. It was missing key ingredients like avocado, artichoke hearts, etc. The funny thing is a manager came by to check on tables. He came by before our food was served and we said everything was fine. Then he came back after the food was served and asked if I wanted a box for my untouched salad. I told him no thanks because it wasn't what I thought it would be. I didn't have the menu in front of me to state what was different from my expectations at the time. He takes my plate and looks like he is sorry. He never asked if I wanted anything else.

John M.,"Coral Springs, FL",79,8,,1.0,6/26/2017,"By far worst experience I had at any of the CPK locations, ate there Saturday night ending up having to take the pizza to-go being that it took 35 minutes from time of order to arrival of soup and a salad then another 12 minutes for the pizza to arrive. I understand being busy or behind but the place was nearly empty. The manager stopped by the table at one point she did not mention anything about the lack of service or provide any help when it was obvious that service was lacking. Ended but leaving normal 20% tip because I was not sure if the server was new or not. As for the manager really no excuse for the experience we had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5
Herb H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",5,13,,1.0,11/12/2016,"The last weekend of August we were visiting ft. Lauderdale and ate at this California Pizza kitchen.  My partner and I ordered the bacon wraps for an appetizer and then the chicken piccata for our entrée.  The appetizer was good, however when our chicken piccata came out I took and bite and ate it.  The second bite I noticed it was severely undercooked.  My partners was undercooked as well.  It is unfortunate because we always used to frequent the joint.  Anyway, the manager didn't make us pay for the appetizer and we left.  Fortunately I didn't get sick.  Later my partner and I were talking and we thought it was really odd that the manager didn't try to persuade us to come back to frequent the restaurant in the future.  He just said sorry about that and odd we went.  Anyway, we won't eat there anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=60

Suzy B.,"Burbank, CA",83,23,2,1.0,11/6/2015,"Ok, so I just relocated to Ft. Lauderdale from living 25 years in Los Angeles, so I know a little bit about CPK.  I've eaten at the one in Burbank, the one in Studio City and the one by the Dorothy Chandler, so I was happy to take my folks to the CPK on Federal a few weeks after I moved here.   Now, I know it's best to stick to the Pizza, because it's called the California PIZZA Kitchen, but my folks wanted the pasta and after packing and unpacking, I needed protein so against my better judgement I ordered the fire grilled ribeye (which was, by the way, as expensive as anything I ordered at The Palm, where they know a little something about steak) So we ordered from a server named Ellen and waited.   And we waited while a couple was seated across the aisle from us.   And we waited while that couple was served, And we waited while that couple finished their meal. And paid their check. And left.  And no sign of Ellen.  Eventually we got our meals.  This is where the fun starts. Ellen walked over to me and my fire-grilled-ribeye-steak and asked me if I wouldn't mind cutting into it while she was there TO MAKE SURE IT WAS THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE I had ordered (which was medium rare)  There is no restaurant on the planet where I had ordered steak where the server asked me to cut into my meat while she watched.  Which should tell you a little something about the cooks in the kitchen and the servers in the front of the house.  I noticed that my folks pasta (and we're Italian, so we know a little something about the stuff) and the pasta and the sauce had that ""we've been sitting in the pass since the other couple started on their main course"" kind of look.  So I asked ELLEN if the pasta had been sitting under heat lamps and instead of apologizing for the food and offering to replace it, she said ""We don't have heat lamps"", which I I'm she knows because this is a server who, I'm sure, had apprenticed at MikeyD's.  So we dug in.  The fire-grilled-rib-eye was almost inedible.  Maybe half of it was edible.  The rest of it was fat & gristle.  And at Palm prices.  So after getting a bill for over $100.00, we left and I decided to write to CPK to tell them about our experience.   This is where it gets even better.  I got an email in reply and then a call from a Mr. Will Stringer, who asked me to call him back on his cell phone (321-917-0166) So I did, but went to voice mail where the mail box was full. (Surprised? I'm not.) So I called every day for a week. Sometimes twice a day.  Always the mailbox was full.  So I returned to the original email I got from CPK and replied about Mr. Stringer and the fact that I couldn't contact him and asked someone else to get in touch with me.  And have heard nothing, from no one.  So here I am on yelp, hoping to let all the BBQ chicken pizza loving people out there that this is not the CPK to go to, and if you do: Do not order the fire-grilled-ribeye Do not order the pasta and Do not sit in Ellen's section.  You can get flat bread pizza from almost anywhere now and there are easy recipes for BBQ chicken pizza on line that you could make at home, without this aggravation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=60
Kevin J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",26,19,,4.0,10/22/2016,We really enjoy coming here and pretty much always get what we expect. The bread is always fresh and yummy and the soups are delicious as well. Oddly enough we really come for the citrus Adobe margarita made with blanco casa amigos tequila. Mike is usually at the bar and makes a great drink. I have recently been to a few Mexican establishments that couldn't figure out a margarita so hats off to you. I usually get the chicken piccate which is always so good and my wife likes the tequila chicken. If you get a pasta dish go ahead and order a grilled chicken breast instead of the regular chicken. Your welcome. The wait staff is always amazing and makes you feel at home expect maybe that one time when an unnamed male server brought us a (free) drink only to throw it back in our face when he saw our tip did not reflect his generosity but that's a different story.  We love it and here and if you order right you will to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=60

Mark W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,7,,1.0,4/19/2017,"I don't know if this particular location is a franchise or if the entire chain is falling apart.  For years, this place was packed and had a great manager.  The service was excellent and many servers stayed there for years.  The food was consistent and reasonable, as it has generally been at the locations we've eaten in around the country.  A few years ago they changed their pizza crust recipe, which to my taste made it drier and tougher. If you don't eat it while it's hot forget about it.  Then they updated the decor, and while I like it, a lot of people were put off by it.  Meanwhile, the terrific manager at this location left and the food and service is extremely unreliable now.  It can be good or it can be horrendous. Unfortunately, three bad meals in a row and we threw in the towel (or rather, napkin).  Speaking of which, they have even changed their napkin. It's now an extremely cheap paper napkin that falls apart upon impact with your hand or mouth.  The final straw was last week.  The four of us entered the restaurant which seemed to have more staff than diners (it was a quiet afternoon on Easter Sunday).  We waited for a host or hostess to come to the front and greet us but everyone who saw us just turned their heads away despite no indication that they had anything better to do.  This includes the new manager.  Finally, one of us walked over to the manager and politely explained that we had been waiting for several minutes (amid an ocean of empty tables) and no one had so much as acknowledged us. He apologized profusely and then he was at our table every five minutes but, alas, the food was terrible.  Even the one thing I always could count on, the original chopped salad, had less salami, less chicken, no cheese unless it was just tasteless, and too little dressing (and I don't like a lot of dressing on salad).  It was basically a plate of romaine lettuce for almost $16.  Even the chop on the lettuce was off (the lettuce was chopped less finely, probably so it would have more volume and look bigger on the plate). Guess what? You aren't fooling anyone. So sorry this old reliable restaurant has gone the way of retail hasbeens like Sears and J.C.

We also had the SEDONA TORTILLA soup and a   MARGHERITA pizza.  Now the food was ok and I don't really think any of us had any complaints about the food itself, but with the restaurant being rather empty, we did not expect the slow and spotty service.  It was so very frustrating to ask for something and then keep waiting, and then by the time they bring you what you initially asked for, then we need something else.  There was absolutely no reason for the slow service in an empty restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=20

What we had:   Fresh hot sourdough bread slices with olive oil and herb mix- delicious. And Jason kept bringing more. :) 1) Thai crunch salad, (full size).  Big fresh bowl of veggies, chicken, rice sticks and more with peanut dressing. Friend LOVED it but couldn't finish it. 2) Regular sausage pizza  (12-13 inches) - BF loved the fresh spicy sausage and he is picky 3)  Regular Pepperoni pizza - friend very happy with his choice  4) Margherita flatbread (about 14 inches) - friend and 8 yr old son were sharing and he does not like spicy anything. Jason suggested capicola (Italian ham)  as it is mild and thinly sliced. He ate all but one piece. 5) Half a caesar salad  - Big salad on plate - very tasty with good cheese and dressing. More than double what my friend though when she ordered it but said it was excellent. 6) I had Fettuccine in a garlic cream alfredo sauce with chicken. Good flavor,, hot with freshly grated cheese. Was it the best ever? No, but for $15.95 near Ft. Lauderdale Beach, a good lunch value.

It seems they have completely changed the recipe, as well as the portion size. The sauce was runny, not creamy, it sat at the bottom of the pan. I had to swirl the noodles in it to get any flavor on them. Very little chicken and not much else of interest in my dish. Nothing special about this plate now.

Sal G.,"Miami, FL",215,810,80,4.0,9/7/2009,"Let me start with the obvious: This is a chain.   I was someone reticent to go to California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) at first due to the fact that it was a chain.  In fact, the first time that I went, I ordered a traditional-style pepperoni pizza.  The traditional pizza is nothing special and should be left alone by any adults attending lunch or dinner.  Noting that there were a lot of specialty pizzas on the menu (which I was too scared to try at first) I returned with a greater resolve to try a new type of pizza.  I was quite surprised at how the non-traditional pizza tasted.  After several times at this restaurant, I have winnowed down my pizza choices to two items: Chipotle Chicken Pizza (minus the bean/corn salsa and the lime sauce brought on the side while adding serrano peppers) -AND- Carne Asada Steak Pizza (tomatillo sauce on the side) I must say, that I crave these two pizzas; their piquancy is a bit much for some -- especially with the addition of the serrano peppers.  The Chipotle Chicken is by far my favorite.  The chicken is always moist, the crust not over-seasoned, the peppers cooked into the cheese to impart a wonderfull aroma and taste, and the sauce a piquant mixture of peppers with a slight sweetness. If this doesn't sound good to you, that is fine.  The wait staff is friendly and open and willing to customize a pizza to your personal specifications.  You are eating out and paying for it, you are allowed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=120

Eddie S.,"Miami, FL",0,19,2,5.0,12/30/2009,"As well as other reviews here, i was avoiding this place just for being a chain. untill one day a friend introduced me to this wonderful place. i go to this CPK location at least twice a week for lunch. i'm a big fan of healthy food and it's been a while since i had a good place to try salads. they have a line of interesting, unique, fresh and healthy salads (well, besides the dressings) and i really like to choose different one every time.  my best hits are the missu salad and the thai salad. the pizzas are also good, and i also tried their mahi mahi WHICH WASNT good at all, so i just went back to their amazing salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=120
Umberto W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,7,,4.0,1/21/2010,"CPK is a great, local casual restaurant for when you want to go out, don't want to spend a ton of money and are looking for something a tad bit healthier and lighter than other offerings in the area.  I highly recommend sitting at the counter (two or less) for either lunch or dinner; ask for Alice at lunch, Michele for dinner. They will recommend menu items if you haven't been and have a lot of regulars that come in to see them. If you're looking for gourmet pizza you will be disappointed though the thin-crust pizzas are as good as I've had anywhere else but if you want a cheerful, lively atmosphere, a couple of glasses of wine, a good salad or small pizza, then CPK should satisfy you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=120
Todd W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,7,,1.0,12/14/2013,"We went at about 8:00pm and the restaurant was nearly empty. That should have been a sign. The service was marginally attentive, but the server forgot to bring the bread she offered to us. The soda was weak and flat, and I asked for a different one. The server brought another, equally horrible soda. When I pointed this out, the server made some excuse about using a different tap, rather than verifying that the new soda was actually better before serving it. The iced tea replacement was adequate, after it took 5 minutes to arrive. The pasta was undercooked and bland. The pizza was cool to the touch when served. It also had no flavor. The server did have the manager remove the pasta dish, but the manager didn't bother to waddle over to see how we were doing.  If he didn't care enough to personally see if there was something he could do, I see no reason to give him or his company any more business.  I won't go back. This is sad, because I used to love CPK, but this store went to crap after it's recent remodeling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=120
EH B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,,5.0,5/23/2011,Consistently great food with multiple price points and super friendly staff. Always busy but they generally get you seated pretty quickly. The salads are healthy and I'd suggest ordering with extra meat. Parkings a bit tight but overflow into boston market makes it doable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=120
Ellen W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,5.0,8/9/2010,"I absolutely love this restaurant.  Being a vegetarian, they have so many dishes to choose from.  Their Pea/Barley soup is the best and this is the only restaurant who makes it vegetarian.  Their salads and pizza varieties are great and sandwiches are delicious!  Whenever I go downtown this is where I end up at the dinner hour.  Their service is also great!  Waiters/waitresses are very friendly!  BTW, the one in Pembroke Pines doesn't even compare to the one in Fort Lauderdale.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=140
Keat G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,29,,2.0,11/24/2007,"Two stars for the really substandard pastas! I've had better meals at other CPK restaurants, and was surprised at how salty the pasta was.  I mean, is it so difficult to put less salt in the food?  I thought it was just me, but other members in my party also complained about there being too much salt in their entrees. I had not been to CPK for some time, and was looking forward to the Peking Duck Pizza, but it was not on the menu.  So I ordered a pasta instead...and got stuck with a plateful of salt. The appetizers were good though, but since the pasta came after my crab cake and egg roll appetizers, I felt SAD at the end of the meal. Yes, SAD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=140
Johnny B.,"South Florida, FL",7,29,,2.0,9/11/2008,"Many people say good things about this place, but I didn't care much for it.  Menu wasn't all that great.  Food wasn't all that great, either.  It was just...plain and boring.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fort-lauderdale-5?start=140
