Jen B.,"Clermont, FL",183,382,231,4.0,8/6/2017,"I've loved CPK since my Atlanta days and this one always brings me back. A nice, fresh, thin pizza will do the trick any time and they don't disappoint.  My daughter and I usually order two pizzas and share. We loved the mushroom pizza and a white pizza and did our thing with leftovers to spare.  I'm with the other reviewer that said I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. It's a nice place and everything goes smoothly but it doesn't stand out in service or in the food like I remember from my Atlanta visits. Maybe it's the mall vibe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3
Daniel K.,"Windermere, FL",272,26,33,3.0,8/1/2017,"Would give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. Just can't give it a 4 star review. Went here for lunch today with a couple of friends and was pretty surprised by how everything was. We didn't have to wait for a table and were seated immediately. Our server was supper polite and attentive. They gave us bread to start off, and we ordered he avocado club egg rolls. The egg rolls were pretty awesome and served piping hot. They served it with a ranch and a spicy mayo/ranch - I thought both of the sauces were alright, nothing great. I was in the mood for a salad so I ordered the Thai crunch which was pretty good. My friends ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken and Sicilian pizza. I think the Sicilian was way better than the chicken. I sampled the Sedona Toritilla soup, but it was a little too sweet my liking.  Overall, food was okay, but not sure if it's worth it at the price point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3
Kara M.,"Orlando, FL",315,132,642,4.0,7/31/2017,"I absolutely love this place!  This was my first visit to California kitchen in Florida. I have visited them in other states, but it had been a while. Now I usually go to the location in Waterford, but me and my boyfriend gave this location a try first. We loved it! Our waiter was great, she gave her honest opinion about all the items on the menu. This is where we fell in love with their soup! I ordered the baked potato soup and he ordered the farmers market soup. THEY ARE DELICIOUS!  I also ordered a small personalized pizza and he ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. They both were very tasty!! With every meal you receive bread with oil&vinegar.  The prices are not the cheapest, but it's worth the money! What's great is, pizza isn't their only good item. ALL of their items are on point to choose from.

Patricia G.,"Orlando, FL",272,373,716,4.0,1/9/2018,"If you're in the mood for pizza but rather sit down at a restaurant than at the busy food court then check this place out. While CPK is known for their pizzas it is not everything they have on the menu. They have a nice variety of pastas, salads and appetizers so not everyone in your party has to order a pizza. Also, the pizza sizes are good individual sizes. Some people can finish the whole thing and others (like me) can get the rest ""to-go."" Last time I visited I had the pepperoni pizza and the menu had an option to add truffle oil. As a truffle oil lover I was intrigued so I opted to try it. Mind blown. I never thought that truffle oil on a pepperoni pizza would be that amazing, although truffle oil is pretty amazing on whatever you try. Anyways, the menu does have a ton of different pizza options... calling all pineapple pizza lovers. My mom says they have a great Hawaiian pizza here.

Seleyna L.,"Orlando, FL",64,128,169,3.0,6/3/2017,"The food was okay, I didn't really understand the hype about CPK. Maybe I just got the wrong pizza. We got the Jambalaya Fettuccine and the Garlic  Chicken Pizza. I like marinara sauce so I got marinara instead of the sauce they had. The kitchen got it wrong, but the waiter was so nice and let us have both pizza's. All three of them were tasty, but not anything where I would continuously go back for more.  The service was excellent, the waiter was very apologetic when the order was misread by the kitchen staff.

Joseph G.,"Winter Garden, FL",134,101,53,2.0,8/20/2017,"Generic. Pretty slow service. I liked that they are trying to step up their food game but - though the lemongrass chicken and superfood bowl looked awesome - the taste fell flat. It certainly looked very delicious, but the chicken didn't taste particular fresh and was in fact a bit dry. We did have some drinks while there which were excellent. Their signature cocktails are indeed tasty, and also heavy handed in a great way.

Melissa L.,"Orlando, FL",112,84,72,4.0,7/29/2017,What I like about eating at this place when I'm shopping is being able to see the calorie count next to each dish on the menu.  Entrées and pizzas are about the same and price. I ordered a cucumber revival today which is a nonalcoholic beverage... gotta say I wasn't a huge fan of it.  But the pepperoni pizza with it the white truffle oil was to die for.

My creamy pasta was dull, it tasted off to me. The bowl my boyfriend got, his dressing wasn't great. The only good things we had were the drinks. I got the strawberry mango sparkler, my friend got mango iced tea and my boyfriend got the mango lemonade. The bread was also delicious. The waiter winked at my boyfriend, a big no for me, then the host said sorry as we were leaving, but kept smiling (very weird). Other than that, the pasta didn't go well with my stomach.

I ordered the carne asada pizza, I am adventurous eater, the meat was good as was the salsa verde, the rest of the pizza I could have done without. My fiancé ordered the margherita pizza, loved it.

On Jan. 19 it was my Birthday so my request CPK at Millenia We ate a late lunch and were served by Israel. He was AWESOME!! He was attentive,polite,witty, and also inquired about our Dough Rewards. I always enjoy the artichoke dip as an appetizer.  But my most favorite menu item is the Butter Cake. It is absolutely AMAZING!! My kids eat well also which is great as kids can be fussy.

José A.,"Port Saint John, FL",7,312,30,4.0,6/21/2015,"This wasn't our first choice for the evening, and we even debated *not* eating here, but in the end we wanted to have a sit-down dinner, didn't have time to dilly-dally (we were going to Ikea afterwards), and anyway, the place smelled good from the outside.   At the Mall-of-Millenia in Orlando, there are plenty of places to choose and eat from, but only a few have ""sit-down-in-their-restaurant"" service.  All the other places were food-court versions of restaurants that exist elsewhere as standalone shops.  Anyway, we were extremely pleased with this place.  The service was very good, our waitress was chatty (just the way I like them) and helped us navigate the menu, being this was our first time there.  My wife had their Italian Deli Sandwich on thick ciabatta bread, while I had their fish tacos.  The tacos were unique in that they used raw red cabbage instead of lettuce and the sauce they dribbled on was exceptional.  I also loved the salsa that came with the chips as part of my dinner.  It was lightly sweet, just perfect.   For dessert my wife had the Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake, while I had their Butter Cake.  Both were a piece of heaven.  I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing, but I did, it was by far the best dessert at a restaurant I have had in quite some time.   This place reminded me that sometimes you've got to look past the cover and just sit down, and read the book...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=40

David H.,"Silver Spring, MD",414,308,403,4.0,1/14/2014,"This is one of the few chain restaurants that I really do enjoy.   I always start with the California Cobb Salad with ranch dressing and always add the beets.  It consists of: Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, avocado, chicken, tomatoes, chopped egg, basil and Gorgonzola with housemade herb ranch or bleu cheese dressing. Option to add beets Do not forget to add the beets if you try this. It adds a nice nutty sweetness to each bite.  Really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas. They seem small, but with an appetizer or salad along with your pizza it is plenty of food.  I remember the first time I tried CPK it was in San Diego... like 14 years ago. It might have been because of the location.. but they had a Peking Duck Pizza.  Wish I could try that again.. doubt it though considering this is Orlando.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=40

Joshua M.,"Boca Raton, FL",270,288,914,2.0,9/8/2013,"California Pizza Kitchen has really gone way down hill in the past couple of years in regards to the food quality and service. I remember the food here used to always taste fresh and it was always a pleasure to come here, when now it's like the 5th choice of a restaurant after all the others are too packed to go to.A friend and I went to CPK on a Saturday evening, and you know something is wrong when every other place at the mall was beyond packed, except for this place. When we sat down, it seemed to me that their menu had shrunk quite significantly. A few years back when this place was great, they had a Buffalo Chicken Pizza, they got rid of that too; just one straw of many to come.  Both of us got the Crispy Mac n' Cheese, which usually is the only reason I'd come to this place. The cheese sauce was not gooey, but very thick. The actually crispy mac n' cheese was just luke warm and not extremely flavorful. Also, their was some strange brown things around the inside of the item. So disappointed in this dish, my friend ate a few bites before leaving on the rest of the plate.  I always wanted to try the Pear and Gorgonzola thin crust pizza here, and I have had it at other places and it was great. Sadly, here I thought it was bland and terrible. When it came out, it basically had almost like a salad on top of it, a problem because it made it difficult to eat with the leafy greens dominating the pizza and making it difficult to get a slice. The pears tasted so processed and not fresh, it really ruined the dish. And even the gorgonzola sauce tasted watered down and added nothing to the dish. I'm usually a big fan of flatbread, but this time it just tasted like cardboard with lots of junk on it. Where usually elsewhere I find Pear and Gorgonzola to be fresh and tasteful, here it was exactly the opposite. My friend got the traditional BBQ Chicken Pizza, but he was not a fan this time. I didn't taste it, but from my view it looked dry and the opposite of tasty. What has happened to this place?! Our waiter was nice, but a little too pushy. From the moment we sat down we were pitched to buy things like some sort of infused water, even when we just asked for regular water. Later on, he also went in for the kill on dessert with us; we were not having it. On a positive note however, when I left my leftover box at the table, a manager came rushing way out of the restaurant to say we forgot this and give it back to us. Honestly, I left it there on purpose because it was terrible, but the fact that this guy came rushing out to give it to us earned them major points back.  At one point in time, I may have given this place a three or even four stars, but the standards here have just tumbled so far down, I fear it is not redeemable. I was so disappointed with our experience here. California Pizza Kitchen used to be our go to place to eat, and now I have to say that I'd try to avoid this place in the future at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=40

It wasn't bad, but was spicier than I expected and probably wouldn't order it again. Service was decent but not outstanding. The restaurant was seating everyone in one corner of the place while the rest of the restaurant was empty. Our one server did the best he could but seemed stretched a little thin.

The waitress explained that they burned the pita. So they brought out another one a few minutes later and it was raw dough on the inside  :(.  Then instead of making it right they didn't acknowledge it and just brought the pizza out when we never ate our appetizer. The pizza had some meat on it when we had ordered a vegetarian pizza.  Don't plan on ever going back. Would recommend you eat at the cheese cake factory at Millenia or the food court.

I caught it and the waitress apologized (a lot) and ran it back to the kitchen. It only took maybe 8 minutes for it to come back. Really not a huge deal, I verify that anything I order him in Gf when it gets to the table for this reason. Shortly after a manager comes over, kneels down and sincerely apologized to my eleven year old... who replies ""it's alright, I wouldnta died!""

I could tell him and the waitress were glad to hear it wasn't a deadly allergy, but still took the whole thing extremely seriously. I loved that he addressed my son and not me and his dad. I could tell how seriously they took the mistake and how eager they were to correct it.

Anna-Marie W.,"Orlando, FL",213,301,800,3.0,12/13/2013,"We rarely frequent chain restaurants anymore as they are usually boring and predictable.  However, on a day where we found ourselves working at the Mall of Millenia in Orlando, we were starving.  We just had no interest in the choices we had at the food court and some of the other full services places had too long of a wait for us (well, me.)  We stumbled into the California Pizza Kitchen where there was no wait and we were familiar with the great food we have had here in the past. After we ordered a couple of appetizers we were immediately brought some crusty bread and olive oil.  Yum..... We started with the White Corn Guacamole and Chips.  A unique presentation, the avocado was mixed in with white corn kernels, black beans, jicama, bell peppers, cilantro and spicy serrano peppers.  It had a great creamy flavor and paired well with the salty tortilla chips. We also ordered the Fried Mac And Cheese.  They, too, were very tasty.  Lots of creamy cheese and macaroni fried with panko breadcrumbs. We decided to split two entrees.  Being that pizza is the namesake of the restaurant we went with the Pear and Gorgonzola Crispy Thin Crust Pizza.  Except it wasn't crispy.  At all.  Neither one of us really cared for it. The crust was topped with pears, caramelized onions and chopped hazelnuts then topped with field greens in a ranch sauce with Gorgonzola crumbles.  Not only was the crust not even close to being crispy, I think we counted about two pieces of hazelnuts.  The cold field green salad on top was mixed with too much dressing and wilted with the heat of the pizza.  This would be a horrible pizza to have to take home because of the hot pizza and the cold salad do not work well together- especially for leftovers.  We were so disappointed. The second entree we ordered was the Quinoa and Arugula Salad.  I love spicy arugula and it mixed well with asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, pine nuts and quinoa.  Topped with Feta cheese and tossed with Champagne Vinaigrette, I thought this was a very unique and tasty salad. Our service was wonderful.  She handled herself very well as a table behind us had misunderstood the menu and blamed her.  Very professional. In all our meal was good.  However, when you call yourself a pizza kitchen I feel like it is the pizza that should be the most delicious item on your menu.  When you advertise a crispy crust and it comes out mushy, that is a major epic fail.  When you advertise hazelnuts on your pizza and there are only two tiny little pieces on the entire pizza, that too is not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=20

Our server was so fantastic and really very helpful with making suggestions. I decided to order a cup of the Sedona Tortilla soup and the Thai Crunch salad. I asked how big the portion size was for the salad and our server said it was huge and actually recommended I downsize to the half order as it would be more than enough for me.  I appreciated that tidbit because as soon as my half order came out, my eyes were as big as saucers! It was a giant heaping of salad and sooo good. I loved the ""crunch"" of the peanuts, wontons and rice sticks thrown in there too alongside the chicken, avocado and veggies. It will more than fill you up. I couldn't even finish it.   The soup was great too.

This time when I came in, I waited at the host stand for almost 5 minutes before anyone bothered to walk up to greet me and find me a seat. (After 2 minutes I asked a server walking by if I could seat myself and they said no, so I just waited.) Fortunately that's where the negative part of my experience stops. What appeared to be the manager on duty came to greet me and find me a seat. As he did so, he asked if I was part of their loyalty program and I asked for a little more information. It's basically an email newsletter and free to sign up. However, he let me know this because they were having a special where you'd get a free appetizer if you signed up. I really appreciated this, as it saved me $5 I was going to spend anyway. My server was friendly and prompt, and I had the White Corn Guac and Chips to start with. It's DELICIOUS and vegan! As a vegan with allergies, it's always fun trying something new that won't ruin my dietary lifestyle or kill me, lol. Then I had the soup- and oh the soup. There should be poetry written about this soup. It's not too heavy, but not watery. It's flavorful without being overwhelming or too salty, and it's a healthier option that definitely fills you up!

We each ordered a glass of red wine when the pizza arrived and by the time we received the drinks, we'd finished eating, so not the speediest service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=60

My guests love this place.  I had never eaten here before Monday, but I was hungry and the food court didn't look interesting.   In we went. We began with the chicken lettuce wraps, which were yummy with the spicy peanut sauce.  My guests got their usual meals.  I ordered a BLT and found out belatedly that it was a pizza.  Nope, can't do it.  The server directed me to a chicken-avocado-bacon flatbread sandwich instead, and that turned out to be a good choice.  I ended up taking home leftover slices of the hawaiian pizza as well.  To be honest, I didn't care for it, but it might have been better fresh. Unless you have a serious sweet tooth, I would suggest staying far away from the flavored lemonades.  They are literally syrup on top of syrup.   I doubt I'd come back on my own, but I'd return if other people wanted to eat here.  Actually, maybe not.  I didn't realize until after we'd eaten that there was a Chik-Fil-A just down the way.  Drat!  2.75 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=60
Jessica E.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2014,"After my experience today, I sent this letter in via their survey website, their main site, and their corporate site.  7/18/2014 To whom it may concern:  I have had a few poor experiences in a row with your restaurant located in the Mall at Millenia on Conroy.  Each time I had one or more of my children with me, and I wasn't sure if there was a correlation, but after today I am convinced there is. Let me start by describing my experience today to you.   I arrived at the restaurant at about 12:15 with my 5 year old son. We were seated right away. However, the greeter led us to a far corner, right next to the kitchen galley doors, where during the course of our time there, there was a constant stream of bus boys walking past with tubs of dirty dishes. Not the most appetizing of environments. I began to look around the restaurant and noticed empty tables in better locations throughout the restaurant. People that arrived after us were seated in them. None of them had kids. Looking around further, I noticed the only customers seated in a less desirable place than my son and I were was another mom with two children, seated right next to the bathrooms.   Our server came and took our drink order, and returned about 5 minutes later to take our food order, which I placed: a thai chicken pizza for me, a cheese pizza and a side of fruit for my son. We waited for our food for 40 minutes. In that time, I had finished my tea, and our server did not check on us once in that time frame. When he brought the food out, he noticed my empty glass and brought me another one. He did not return for another long stretch, when I then asked for boxes. My glass was empty again but the server apparently did not notice this as I was never offered or brought another refill. I received my boxes and check. During the wait for those things, I noticed who I assumed to be a manager walking around asking various tables how everything was. I was fully prepared to express myself in the restaurant to the manager, but she never came to my table. We paid and left. I declared to nobody in particular on the way out, since no one seemed to care how our experience was, that we were never, ever returning.   I have some suggestions on how you could improve your restaurant. I am not sure whether you train your greeters to marginalize families with children, or if animosity towards young families is a prerequisite for being hired, or if you believe that other customers don't want to be in the same vicinity as families with small kids, but clearly one of aforementioned must be true. I would suggest then that you remove your extensive and seemingly welcoming child's menu from the restaurant. Offering a multi-page paper menu with crayons and activities, with several food offerings, gives the impression that you welcome children when that is in stark contrast to how you treat families with children. I would also suggest you rethink the placement of your restaurant. It's in a mall. Where moms shop. With their kids. And you serve pizza. It would seem that this would be a perfect match for a ready-made customer base but my experience has shown that this particular restaurant (I can't speak to the whole chain) is not desirous of those kinds of customers.   Please be assured that if losing my business was your goal, you have achieved it. I will also make sure to tell all my friends who have small children to not burden you with their company.

Dd H.,"Roswell, GA",0,58,5,3.0,6/18/2012,"Okay, So I am trying this again after two previous tries where I could not seem to get waited on.    Great service and love my avocado eggs rolls.   The pesto pasta with chicken however was a major disappointment....... 5 yes FIVE very small approx 1/4 inch square pieces of chicken.    I honestly thought they forget it.    When I asked, the waiter said, there is a piece, so it is chicken. Major disappointment!   Next time I wouldn't bother to pay for the less than 1/8cup of chicken,    I honestly think I will just give up on this location.  CPK is generally a fav but not this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=60
