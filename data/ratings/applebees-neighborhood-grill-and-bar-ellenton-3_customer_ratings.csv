23,Cathy J.,"PARRISH, FL",89,131,308.0,2.0,2012-12-12,"One random Wednesday night, my husband and I decided to drive our golf cart down to our neighborhood Applebee's. This location is always crowded, as it is one of the few dining establishments in the greater Ellenton/Parrish bustling metropolis. We were promptly seated in a booth so that my husband could have padded seating as he had recently suffered some work-related burns on his bottom side. Our server was a lovely young lass who was very efficient. I always indulge in Applebee's 2-4-1 cocktails, and on this occasion I opted for the high-end house pinot grigio. Six glasses later, we feasted on the nachos appetizer. Our lovely server came back to take our main order, and she had trouble understanding me as drinking wine often makes me revert back to my Mandarin dialect. Thankfully, my husband was able to translate for me. To continue my wine theme, I enjoyed the napa chicken and portobellos (under 550 calories!). I was not overly impressed, but that could have been because I was on my 8th glass of pinot and slumped over in the booth.  Overall, Applebee's is a wonderful place to visit when it's late, your stomach is rumbling, and you feel like taking the golf cart out for a spin. Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3?start=20,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002
21,Doug G.,"Ellenton, FL",0,6,,1.0,2013-04-18,The service was the worst. The bartender made a rum runnerthat tasted like gas. At no time did she offer to fix it. The food came out burnt and cold. When we contacted the main office since no manage was available to see us we still have not heard back after several weeks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3?start=20,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007
22,Jamison E.,"Parrish, FL",72,100,81.0,4.0,2013-05-28,Stopped in here for a late night snack and a few drinks and as always it was friendly and the quality was good.  I recommend this location if you are looking for a reasonable meal at a decent price.  Not 5 star cuisine but what you would expect from an Applebees.  The employees all seem to be happy to work here and will go above and beyond to help you when needed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3?start=20,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
19,Adam B.,"Sarasota, FL",3,34,7.0,3.0,2014-03-02,"Average is the best description for Applebee's. The menu looks better than it tastes.

20,Lady H.,"Palmetto, FL",0,102,27.0,3.0,2014-06-16,"Applebee's is Applebee's. If you've been to one you've been to them all.

26,Neil F.,"Sarasota, FL",0,11,1.0,2.0,2014-07-18,Went for dinner last night with family. Spinach & artichoke dip was good. I had fish. Server forgot cocktail sauce. Fish was cold by the time he got back with it. Wife had Thai salad & said was very good except not enough dressing. Kids had burgers.

11,Lauren G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",351,41,124.0,4.0,2014-10-10,This place is happening for a Thursday night! We walked in shortly after 10 and were able to sit but just barely and they had karaoke going on and drink specials! We were very excited after having just made a long drive! Our waitress was super sweet and attentive as could be being that she had a lot of customers and probably made for a long night! Our food was good and no mistakes were made. We were very happy with our visit!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3,,,,,

24,Shel P.,"Palmetto, FL",0,4,,2.0,2014-11-09,"What once was a nice place to eat, sure took a turn for the worse. Food not consistent, service iffy. Seated quickly, restaurant was not busy. Ordered appetizers , waited 40 minutes with no food and no waitress. Asked to speak to manager. No manager. Our entire party got up and left. Yes, still waiting for appetizers.  Used to be such a great place to grab a bite.

9,Stacey T.,"Green Hill, TN",20,110,153.0,1.0,2014-12-21,"When I walked in the front door, someone had just thrown up, when I left it was still there.  The service was good but I was disturbed by my pot stickers arriving with a side of sauce that was basically empty with sauce on the sides.  It appeared that it was reused or had spilled and was not refilled.  The bathrooms were also dirty.  I called when leaving to speak to a manager when I saw that the vomit was still out front where people were waiting and hung up after being left on hold for 10 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3,,,,,
25,Kim K.,"Bradenton, FL",0,61,,5.0,2015-01-26,"Yes I know it's a chain restaurant however, I feel they deserve a review because it was one of the nicest, friendliest and tasty culinary experiences my husband and I enjoyed in a chain restaurant. The staff are friendly and patient. I ordered the extra crispy shrimp which were soft, flavorable and there was a lot. My husband had the fish tacos and before I could even get a taste he'd devoured them. So I'm guessing they were fantastic. A shout out to our waitress, Mary, fantastic and fun service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3?start=20,,,,,
16,Sarah A.,"Ellenton, FL",3,3,,5.0,2015-03-29,Got the oriental chicken salad and it was amazing! Half size was more than enough. My husband had the steak and loved it.

18,Dennis M.,"Ellenton, FL",0,22,,1.0,2016-01-20,Carside to go. NOT a car waiting and slow inside. Server took 13 minutes b4 even came out to vehicle. I ordered. She said 10 min. Was there at 1:09 p.m. Finally got tired of waiting and walked in it was 1:48 and then my order pops up and she got it wrong after clearly explaining what I wanted. I'm the idiot tho! As this happened last time I was there and said I'd never go back. Even tipped the girl 3 bucks for that service. How crazy!! No one to blame but myself for giving them a second chance . Even if they were busy it's still no excuse for NOT listening to a customer order and making sure it's correct before handing it to them. Especially after waiting over 40 minutes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3,,,,,
10,Laural Elayne D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",12,6,,1.0,2016-02-13,"Do yourself a favor and steer very clear of this place. Service is terrible every time. 30 minutes for drinks so your beer will be warm. 45 minutes for a blondie brownie and ice cream.  the brownie will be cold. This isn't the first time we have had a bad experience either. Last visit the waitress forgot to put our order in so we sat for an hour waiting before we finally asked for a manager. Take your money to Ruby Tuesdays or Chilis, you'll at least get cold beer and warm food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3,,,,,
6,Phillipa L.,"Riverview, FL",58,92,701.0,3.0,2016-03-02,"I was shopping at the Outlet Mall in Ellenton and wanted a quick bite.  Applebee's has been known to offer the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 which offers a shareable appetizer from the pre-selected options and two entrees.  On this particular visit I had the riblet basket.  On this visit the fries were a little over cooked and the riblets were not as tasty.  Maybe my sauce selection of Chipotle made them taste different when I usually use the sweet BBQ.  They have some healthy choices on the menu like salads and the Asian chicken wonton.  But for the most part their food taste like frozen packaged entrees.  I had not eaten there in a while and that day I remembered why I hadn't.  Their boned in chicken wings are good though.  Applebee's is a casual diner, the service was quick and we were seated promptly the food was just okay in my opinion.  But the prices are reasonable and offers for a quick in and out dining experience.  There are tons of selections so maybe one may work out for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3,,,,,

14,Suzanne Z.,"Cleveland, OH",0,2,2.0,2.0,2016-04-06,We had stopped here after driving 3 hours from Miami.

8,Loren T.,"Lakeland, FL",292,3,,1.0,2016-05-06,"This might be the worst Applebee's I've ever been to. Our server seemed absolutely miserable. Never smiled once. I ordered a steak and she didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked. I had to literally hunt her down for 10 mins to tell her how I wanted it prepared. There may have been 10 customers in the restaurant and it still took almost an hour to get our food. When my steak finally arrived I immediately noticed that the steak I ordered (8 oz) was hardly even 6 oz. so I mentioned it to our server. She rolled hers eyes, took my plate back to the kitchen and came back saying they would make me another steak to make up for the lack of size. 15 mins later they bring me a piece of meat on a plate that had almost no grill marks and that they had clearly thrown into the microwave. This meat looked nothing like the first. I'm not even sure it was steak. As much as my appetite didn't want to eat it I decided just to try it. Worst mistake ever. The ""meat"" turned to mush as soon as I bit into it. Almost inducing vomit. At this point I just wanted to get out of there. I got my check and tipped 20% regardless of the horrible food and service. I didn't complain after. I just smiled and walked out. Needless to say I will NEVER go back to that location. Do yourself a favor and drive 20 mins to the other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3,,,,,
5,Yorke W.,"Birmingham, AL",0,91,30.0,5.0,2016-06-10,"Traveling on I75 & starving. Took exit & pulled into Applebee's. Haven't eaten at one in years. Service was quick, food was good, waitress was very nice. Seating in booth was comfortable. Music was nice. I had burger with home made chips & hubby had black bean soup & shrimp salad. Waitress gladly gave me large ice tea to go. Menu was a little confusing but sure when we go again it will be easier.

2,Sara P.,"Palmetto, FL",47,6,4.0,2.0,2017-07-31,"Not very impressed this trip. Was greeted at the door by a young lady who appeared less then excited to be there. The margarita I ordered arrived only after reminding our waitress about me ordering the drink and tasted of just mix, so much that I could not finish drinking them. My steakhouse salad had perfectly cooked steak, but the small amount of steak and actual salad was a bit discouraging for the price. The waitress was nice, but seemed like she wanted us moved very quickly. I understand that, but the place was not by any means busy so it would have been nice to feel that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ellenton-3,,,,,
