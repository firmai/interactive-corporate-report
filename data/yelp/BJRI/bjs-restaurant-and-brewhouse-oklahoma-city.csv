Ashley W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",344,30,93,4.0,12/29/2017,"One of my favorite chain restaurants around town. BJ's is the perfect place to watch a sports game or to catch up with a friend you haven't seen in a long time. And I did both tonight!  I'm always happy with the food I get but tonight specifically, I just ordered dessert. And if you go to BJ's and don't order a pazookie, did you really go to BJ's? You can't beat the deliciousness that ensues when you eat the warm cookie and ice cream. The best.  The service was also top notch and the waitress was on it even though it was super busy! Impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city
John J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",38,7,10,2.0,9/1/2017,"I have been to BJ's many times and early on things were quite good.  This has all changed in the last 18-24 months.  Of the last 6 take-out orders we have gotten, 5 have been wrong or missing something.  We decided to stop getting take-out from there after the last major mistake. As for the in-house dining, well things aren't doing any better there these days.  During my last visit, I ordered a steak medium rare.  It came out a very deep shade of purple.  Our waitress what shocked by how undercooked it was.  She brought my steak back, but it was a different steak.  She said that ""the chef didn't like the look of the first one.""   Geez, I am glad I didn't eat it, but why didn't they notice earlier?  The 2nd steak was cooked properly but turned out to be 1/3 fat.  Not marbled, but the entire end of the steak was just fat.   For a $25 steak, I had hoped for a little better cut.  Granted they aren't a steakhouse, but they are a restaurant that does mixed grill.  They should have known better. As for the rest of the family.  Wife's salad was par or below and neither of the kids were happy with their meals.  Things they had ordered in the past but didn't pass muster on this go around. Needless to say, we going to give BJ's and extended break.  An almost $100 (including tip) lunch, should at the very least leave you sated.  The kids went home and made sandwiches. I gave them 2-stars instead of 1 because the service has nearly always been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city
Angela M.,"Edmond, OK",53,139,328,4.0,8/10/2017,"The food is good, but not exceptional.  It's on par with a chain restaurant, but slightly better in quality.

Nancy R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",648,273,1899,5.0,7/22/2017,"I love BJ's, the food and the service is always excellent. From California to Oklahoma, you can count on consistency. Today my good friend Kim and I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken served with sautéed onions, brown rice, tomatoes, brussels sprouts in a delicious Lemon sauce. The chicken was so tender, it cut easily with a fork. We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder soup, it was thick and creamy full of clams and diced potatoes-delicious. Since I had to go back to work, I ordered their New Sunset Peach iced tea instead of a cold brew, The Peach iced tea was made with all-natural flavors (sugar and artificial sugar served separately)  - very refreshing. I can't leave BJ's with ordering a Pizookie, so today we had a Salted Caramel Pizookie - Worth every calorie - Yum. Our server Bryan was friendly, helpful and very fast - excellent customer server!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city
Don N.,"Edmond, OK",28,52,103,3.0,8/16/2017,"Excellent choice of pizza, burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc.  i like their deep dishes but they also have thin crust.  I got a large with 1/2 BJ's favorite and 1/2 gourmet 5 meat.  Also got the artichoke spinach dip which was pretty good but not spectacular.  The chips were pretty good. They have a nice beer draft beer selection which they brew themselves.  Open late til 1AM on the weekends.  The servers are very friendly.  Only gripe is I wish the crust was crispier.  I'll ask them to do that next time.  They're famous for their pizookies which are large cookies in a pan with ice cream on top. We got the churro pizookie and it was great, nice and crispy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city
Kimberly M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",204,118,110,4.0,11/18/2016,"For the most part I love this place.  The pazookies are to die for and they're gluten free so bonus for my family's diet needs. My favorite server is Drew.   I would ALWAYS ask for him.  He has great follow up which is key to a great dining experience. One option I was stay away from on the menu is the super salad.  The description on the menu made it sound like it would be the best salad you'll ever have - cue the loud buzzer.  NO!  Maybe it was just mine, but it was nothing more than lettuce that tasted like dirt and quinoa that would stick in your teeth. I actually ordered this salad yesterday when I came to dine there for a business lunch.  Because it tasted so bad, I asked the server for more dressing so I could top it with anything to make it taste better.  The dressing never came.  This server, which was obviously not Drew, never refilled my water and did not bring any dressing for my salad.  I didn't want to ask a second time so I ate it thinking, 'at least it's healthy'.   Besides this one disappointing experience, I would recommend this place for any occasion.  It's great for birthdays, date nights, game nights, girls' night out ... you name it and they'll have the perfect item for the occasion.  (JUST NOT THE SUPER SALAD) Trust me on that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city
Katie G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",52,117,162,2.0,3/11/2017,"I am sad, so sad, to have to give them 2 stars. They used to be my go-to for a place where everyone could get what they wanted.  Alas. The last few times I've gone, food has been wrong, service has been slow, and things have just overall not gone smoothly. In addition, they recently got rid of their amazing super thin crispy fries, and replaced them with crappy fries.

Nigel P.,"Oklahoma City, OK",30,142,109,4.0,4/19/2016,"I never liked BJ's pizza much; I found it really doughy and greasy, so I kind of discounted the place, but now I realize I should have branched out. The last time we went here, we ordered the calamari appetizer, the portabello burger, a chicken quinoa dish, and some sort of fancy salad. All of the items were very tasty and creative. From what I could tell, BJ's has an order of calamari every two minutes. They mass-produce the stuff. It baffles me how Gordon Ramsay seems to find every mushy calamari dish in the country on his show, Kitchen Nightmares. It's basically fast food, how do these places supposedly mess up frying calamari? Anyway, I degress. The calamari was not mushy. The presentation has improved greatly since last time I went to BJ's. Everything had that sort of faux-gourmet feel that mid-range restaurants seem to be capitalizing on lately. Altogether, it was a good experience and I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city
Sean T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,101,119,2.0,9/8/2016,I've been to multiple BJ's in OKC. I recently visited this location and I'm out! I ordered a pizza. It was nearly inedible because it was so salty.

Dessert.  Oh the sugary goodness of a still-warm baked cooki....oh, the ice cream on....salted...carmel....OK, let's not talk about the Pizookie, because I am still in a sugar-induced coma.  It's why I didn't write my review yesterday after I went to BJ's.  I've been recovering ever since cause I inhaled it - it was SO GOOD.   I also split a Triple Decker sandwich with a friend.  It was tasty, with turkey, ham, roast beef.  Unfortunately the pickles were speared on the top to make it look pretty, making my entire sandwich bun somewhat pickle-soggy.   But the great service, pizza, and dessert are enough to hold BJs at a solid 4 star!  Woo hoo!

Bart T.,"Edmond, OK",267,7,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"Eek, Me Thinks Not (one star) is so fitting. I have been here before and food has been good but somewhere along the way BJ's found shortcuts to serving food quickly based upon the crowds and popularity. BJ's is a dressed up drive-thru with mediocre food... (the food came out so fast, and they were slammed on a Friday night, that I found it to be very odd)... Well, the food spoke for itself, it was horrid. This has to be the worst restaurant experience I have had in recent memory.  The BJ's famous Pizookie used to be better - and that one menu item took the longest to cook (or heat up). It took longer to heat up a cookie and top it with ice cream than it did to cook tuna, shrimp, chicken or make Alfredo... the garlic knot even seemed 'day old.' Pizookie has been hacked by other brick oven pizza joints and much better. So, I have zero reason to ever return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city

My most recent visit involved drinks, a DELICIOUS brussel sprout appetizer, and dessert. I do appreciate the eclectic menu and wholesome ingredients. Perhaps because of the location and general expense, I save this one for a nice occasion like business meetings or out-of-town guests. They have a separate section for large parties (20-30 ppl).

There is something magical about a large warm cookie with a nice cold scoop of ice-cream on it and they do it right! The white chocolate mac, the cookies n'cream, the salted caramel, triple chocolate, the good ol' chocolate chunk...they are all wonderful.

Mb A.,"Memphis, TN",16,52,35,2.0,8/6/2017,"I really love the food here but bar service is bad. We've come in 3 times in the past 2 months & had the same issue. We like to sit at the bar. Each time we've had a blonde female bartender who just doesn't get it. The first time we just assumed she had a bad day. There are only five or six people at the bar and she seemed like she did not want to be there. She was short and rude  and only asked how things were when she gave us our check.  We had to ask for service, silverware, app plates & dessert.  second time we came in, again bar wasn't full or busy -she didn't greet for 11 minutes & literally looked right at us multiple times. We knew this could be trouble but we were willing to give her another chance. We were cordial friendly & enjoying our time out. Both my husband and I have been in the restaurant business; we understand things can be stressful and busy, but that was clearly not the case either time. It may be she doesn't care about being tipped & if that's the case put a sign on the bar saying so so I don't waste your time or my money.  This lady does not need to be behind a bar. Or in the service industry. The third time we came with a friend and once again, we looked at each other questioning our seating option when we saw her behind the bar; we gave it one more shot. after sitting at the bar for 9 minutes and her not even acknowledging us  our friend said let's go elsewhere. we got up and left. Note to management: if you want to fill the bar and make money at the bar I suggest you find a professional bartender with a good attitude. we may be back but will definitely not sit at the bar",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=20

Quijana B.,"Silver Spring, MD",408,478,4022,3.0,11/6/2014,"Ahi Poke I just needed to leave that there, all on its own for a moment. Ahi poke is one of my favorite foods from Hawaii, and friends enjoy teasing me with amazing photos of their simple lunches. I had to make the trip to BJ's to order the closest thing I can find in a restaurant in this landlocked state.   The good news is that the poke is not at all bad, and is probably delicious for those who don't know how much better it could be.  The bad news is that it left me more homesick than ever, and had me wanting to run to the kitchen with Sam Choy's cookbook in one hand and some sesame oil in the other.  Really, the sesame oil would be enough. Maybe I'll bring some with me next time. And some rice, because the tortilla chips simply confused me. We also ordered salads and pizza, and I can see why people return.  The deep dish crust was good and greasy, and held the toppings well. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but was tasty enough that we would order it again.  Side salads were a standard size, but had a few nice twists.  I particularly liked the pear and walnut salad, which had plenty of texture and flavor throughout.   And I had to try the Pizookie, which looks much bigger than it is, but is easily enough to share with someone. Ours was half chocolate chip, half dark chocolate salted caramel. The ice cream did its job by melting all over the cookie, which made it difficult to know how much had been consumed. What started out as ""just a bite"" quickly became ""I'll skip dinner and head to the gym!"" and then it was gone.... Will we return? Maybe. I would not go out of my way to visit, but would pick BJ's over other chain restaurant options if I was in the area. I'll order the ahi poke and then drown my sadness under a pool of molten cookie goodness. And then I'll head to the gym.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=20

I also always get a wedge salad- they're so hard to find around here and I always love the ones they prepare. If you've never been before, one of the greatest things they have is the Pizookie. It's my favorite dessert anywhere. The cookies and cream is the best (basically a hot cookie with ice cream and cookies and cream on top). Also, they recently added the ability to pay with Apple Pay from your iPhone through their mobile app, which is incredibly handy and makes the checkout process so quick and seamless.  I'm top of all of this, the inside of the restaurant is so nice and always so clean. It's dimly lit which is nice, especially for a nice dining experience.

Distrust the opinion of anyone who thinks really highly of the pizza. It's not bad, but you should stick your nose up snootily at anyone who tells you that this is the best pizza they've ever had. Your best bet is the Pizookie®. It's about the only thing I get when I go with some friends who are unnaturally obsessed with this place. They will let you split different flavors in one pan (in my personal experience anyway), so that's always useful if you want to try a couple of different things. Red Velvet. Triple Chocolate, etc. Refuse to share. Tell your significant other to get their own damn Pizookie®.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=20
Jim H.,"Memphis, TN",18,98,237,4.0,1/2/2015,"When we are in town to see in-laws, this is one of the places I was want to go. The food is good and I love the pizookie dessert. This visit was at 4:30 PM on Wednesday afternoon, which was New Year's Eve.  We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer. The first one that came out was overcooked and we had to send it back, but the second one was cooked well and tasted great.The funny thing about this is our in-laws said that in the past, the calamari had been variable, where on one visit it would be cooked perfect and the next visit, it would be overcooked and have to be sent back. So, when we ordered the calamari, we had even told our waiter that if it's overcooked were sending it back and he still decided to deliver the overcooked one to our table and we immediately send it back. Go figure! So, onto the entrées. My wife ordered the roasted vegetable flatbread pizza, minus goat cheese, to make it vegan - (thanks to the waitress, who is vegan, for the suggestions to my wife on vegan items!). My wife thought this was very good. My father-in-law and I ordered a large pizza, 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage with black olives and mushrooms on both. He thought this was good, I thought it was alright.  My mother-in-law ordered Chipotle honey glazed salmon and she thought it tasted very good And now the coup de grace, one thing that has  always been outstanding on my previous three visits to BJ's, is the chocolate chunk Pizookie. This is a large chocolate chunk cookie served hot, in a cast iron skillet with two scoops of ice cream on top. This is outstanding! So, this was at least my third time visiting here and despite the server bringing out the overcooked calamari the food was all good, as it has been on previous visits, and I'm sure I'll be back here during our next trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=40

The food is mediocre, nothing special, but not bad at all for the price!  I absolutely adore their selection of privately brewed beers! Their pumpkin beer is to DIE for! I've had a huge selection of pumpkin beers, there's no pumpkin beer seen that's gone un-tasted, and this one is by far my favorite! The price is very reasonable too, only $15 for a pitcher! Most all their beers are reasonably priced.  Much appreciation from my husband and I for their large selection of televisions to watch your sports games on. We called ahead to make sure they'd be playing our game (made sure to show up early) and just as told on the phone, we were allowed to have a television designated to our desired game. That is important to us and they followed through on their promise, so we were pleased! The televisions could be bigger... considering how high up they are on the walls, but... whatever... I'm just glad they have tv's.  Our service was attentive! Orders were taken in a timely manner, drinks were delivered promptly and our waters were never empty! Which is saying something because my husband and I went through three waters each in like a half an hour. Our waitress was on it!  Overall, I would recommend this place, and we'll most certainly be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=40

Natalie K.,"Oklahoma City, OK",59,16,,5.0,4/21/2015,"If you want to be served delicious food by the nicest people in the city, go ahead and eat here. We went to eat on a Saturday night, and I couldn't believe how genuinely nice every single person on the staff was. From the hostess, to the employee who seated us, to the waiter, everyone just seemed happy to be working there. And not only was our waiter friendly, but he was prompt with the food and knowledgeable of their extensive food and beer menu. The wait was projected to be about 20 minutes by we were seated in ten. To start, we ordered the Ahi Poke. The flavors were great and the wonton chips were warm and crispy, but the quantity was less than I was used to (but still tasted great, which is the important thing). For drinks and entrees, I ordered their Hopstorm IPA which is a great all-around IPA, and a burger which came with a very large side of fries. My partner ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which came out huuuuge! The service I experienced that night left a lasting impression on me.

Maybe I just didn't order a good meal that night because I ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and I absolutely hate it.. I'm a very big fan of pasta and this wasn't for me. The noodles was so hard and stale and my food was cold.

Thomas O.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,51,,4.0,10/9/2015,"For my monthly lunch outing I chose BJs for several reasons. My Daughter in Law Bridget was visiting from Oregon, and she is gluten intolerant. She was exuberant over the varied and extensive gluten free menu offered, and all the help offered by our server Anessa.  Bridgetsavored some Broccoli Cheddar soup, and a classic burger with pepper jack. I opted for the Jambalaya, and it was a delightful dish,both visually and tastefully .Daughter Robin, and Granddaughter Heather had a Scampi Pasta, and a BBQ chopped salad. All plates were cleaned out so thats a statement in itself.  I asked Anessa for a gluten free desert we could all share...Everyone at the table claimed they didn't want any dessert, but somehow when this PIZOOKIE, (a hot chocolate chip cookie with a large gob ice cream on it) arrived all the spoons got busy and it vanished.  I only have two things to fuss about, one the place is kind of noisy so conversations can be a bit strained. Two, I had the house IPAs tasty and well crafted but the hoppiness level was more on the level with a Bass Ale rather than say an Abita IPA.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=40

Tonight I came in to try the pizza and cucumber jalapeño margarita I had heard someone talk about. The drink was ok. The pizza I ordered was the buffalo chicken pizza with celery!? Disgusting! Why would anyone put basically raw celery on a pizza blows my mind! I know shame on me for not reading the description, but I'm not a picky eater and it's never been a problem especially with pizza! I would eat any topping but I guess not celery. It was way to much celery too, I had to tear the pizza apart to not avoid all the celery. Overall without that pizza 3 stars, if I had only ever tried the pizza 2 star it was that bad. Almost forgot to mention the small pizza was around $16. Doubt I will return and if so not for pizza. Also one last thing the menu is completely overwhelming! There is way too much going on with that menu, I like to have options but geez why soooo many!

Rachel S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",64,400,539,3.0,2/9/2013,"Whew, okay. So this experience was a roller-coaster of emotions for me. That phrase is dumb. I like roller-coasters. We went here after an early D&D wrap up, and if I know I'm going out to eat, I try to choose somewhere I haven't been because I have a review problem. Also, it was late enough that there wasn't a plethora of choices. I'm not big on beer but normally places like this have a giant selection of ales and such that they don't have in your average eatery that also happens to have alcohol. So I ordered some sort of cider, and when she looked at my I.D., she said she couldn't serve me because it's expired. Urrrgh. I didn't even really pay attention to my I.D., because it's ONLY an I.D. -not a driver's license. And I've been getting alcohol no problem so it didn't even cross my mind. I wasn't upset with the server by any means, it just kind of... sucked. There are probably more eloquent ways to word that, but that's what encompasses how I felt most. I swear by my pretty floral bonnet... (not looking forward to a tag agency trip).  That was just a little experience side note, nothing to do with my actual rating. Though my emotions started here. For my meal, I ordered the mahi-mahi over pineapple fried rice and vegetables. It sounded amazing! When I got it, the rice was slightly undercooked and the taste was... jumbled. It reminded me of a few times when I tried a new rice mix at home and it didn't turn out well. The fish was bland and chewy. I couldn't eat the rest in good conscious. It was just so awful. My boyfriend insisted that I say something, but I just -can't-. I have this weird block that makes me panic up if I feel like I have to send something back or complain. More often than not I suck it up and eat it, or pretend to take it home to eat and still pay for it. It hasn't happened at all often, which is of course a good thing, but it sure is a moment of sheer TERROR for me. Finally, my boyfriend said something and our server was very nice about it and said she'd take it off our ticket and I could get something else. By now, my sympathetic nervous response had kicked in because of the stress I was putting myself through and I wasn't very hungry anymore. I'll admit, I cried a bit. I really do hate doing that. The manager came to our table to make sure everything was alright and apologized about the food and such. I felt like I was going to die. How embarrassing (to me)! But she was most kind and helpful. I chose the spring roll appetizer, though and liked it quite a bit. So my rating started at 2 stars, but after composing myself and analyzing it more closely, it got to 3 stars: I tried my boyfriend's fries that came with his burgers and they were delicious, and he really enjoyed his burger. I did taste my boyfriend's beer, and it was tasty. The spring rolls were yummy. The staff handled the situation way better than I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=40

I ordered it well done but once I bit into the burger, I noticed one part of the meat was still pink. I just pulled the pink part off and ate the rest so it wasn't anything to make a big fuss over.

Stephen L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",481,342,120,1.0,2/15/2011,"My review of this restaurant is not based on the food. It is based on the awful experience that my girlfriend and I had on a Friday evening. As I said, we were going to eat at a chain restaurant on one of the busiest nights of the week. With this in mind we expected a bit of a hassle when it came to getting a table, but nothing like this. When I called ahead to find out what the wait time (at 6pm), I was told the wait was about 25min. The hostess said that they did not accept reservations, but they do ""call ahead waiting."" She explained that this is where you give your name, and as long as you checked in with the hostess in less than a half hour the time would go toward your wait. We were about 15mins away. So by the time we got there, as it was explained by the hostess, we would realistically only have to wait 10-15mins.  We put our name on the ""Call-ahead waiting"" list and went to the restaurant. When we arrived at BJ's I was told that it would be just a few minutes, but they didn't have anymore vibrating pagers, so I needed to come back in a bit to get one. I went back about 20min later, and was given a pager. She proceeded to tell me that they were really pack and it would be another 10mins. Another 20mins later I went to the hostess and was told that there was still 2 people ahead of me, but since ""they didnt come get a pager till after me"" that I would get to skip them. A little shady, but I went with it. The hostess then said it would be another 5mins. At this point a man and his girlfriend came up to the hostess and asked to speak to the manager. The manager came out and enthusiastically greeted him, as apparently they were good friends. The man asked the manager ""can you put me on the list for a table?"" To which the manager replied ""I'm not sticking you on the list, you can have the next table."" So after many people had been waiting over an hour, the manager bumped everyone for a friend. Not only low class, but while bending the rules is ok, its flat out dumb to do on one of your busiest nights. I then go back up to the hostess and explain that, with my ""call-ahead"" time, we had been waiting well over an hour and 15min. I was then told that putting your name on the call ahead list is different than the regular list. I was informed that my ""wait didn't begin until I showed up."" I then asked what the point of it was and was rudely informed that it was a technique developed by their parent company to get more customers to come in to eat in spite of a long wait. So the ""call ahead waiting"" is completely useless and dishonest.  She proceeded to seat us when I began to explain to customers that were walking in what the ""real"" wait time was. My girlfriend and I were seated immediately in a booth for 6 people. On their busiest night they sat 2 people in a booth, when there were huge parties waiting longer than us. Other than that the food was a typical performance by that of a chain restaurant. However, while I used to enjoy BJ's, I will never go back to this location. The manager is dishonest and so are the companies' policies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=80
David E.,"Edmond, OK",38,12,,5.0,8/8/2012,"This place is a staple in my go-to restaurant list. Like many people, I've dined there many times and my experience has been consistent with every visit. The parking can be a hassle if you're coming in on a busy night. Most people park in the mall parking lot and walk over. Luckily, I've not had to do that.  The waiting area is a bit smaller when you fit a few parties of 3-4 in there with your usual smattering of couples waiting for a table. We typically dine around 5:30-6ish since we get off work early, so the crowd usually isn't that bad. Though when we're on our way out, we have to say ""excuse me"" a few times trying to get out the side door instead of the revolving one.  Service is actually not that bad. There's been a few times when the waiter/waitress' mind was elsewhere or simply un-entertained by us. Though you'll find those people anywhere. Maybe they're not normally like that either. Anyhow, the wait staff is quite friendly and very informative when it comes to questions on the menu.  As for the food, my girlfriend loves their Santa Fe Salad as well as many other items. As for myself, I'm a one dish wonder. I've tried all of their burgers and would recommend any one of them. Though the reason I get the burgers every time isn't because of the way they cook them or prepare them. No, it's the crispy thin fries that come on the side. You can get the larger fries, but if you've tried the crispy thin ones, I don't know why you would. They're perfect. Ask for some ketchup and you can just sit back and enjoy your fries with or without it.  As for their selection of beers, you can't go wrong with a Jeremiah Red. I like to try their featured ""seasonal brew"" when a new one pops up, but I haven't gotten many. They're not bad though. Pumpkin Spice in the fall was a bit....interesting though.  Also, they offer online ordering and pickup of to-go orders, but you have to pay at the restaurant. No online transactions as of yet. The to-go area is usually very accurate on their pickup times as well. I showed up a little before it was time and they had just finished putting my order together. If you don't feel like going in, you can call the number on the sign that is posted in their to-go parking spaces. I used it once in the winter (felt kinda bad for the girl who brought it out to me though) and they're very compliant. Though good luck even getting into the to-go parking on a busy night. Some people just can't park and walk and would rather take those instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=80

I also ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger with Sourdough Bread.  This burger was super disappointing and really didn't do it for me.  The texture  was all wrong on this.  The bacon was dry.  The beef was dry.  The sourdough was toasted too much and the whole thing nearly dehydrated me.  The flavor wasn't their either.

Chris G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,7,14,4.0,12/28/2010,"I just wanna get this out of the way from the get-go: this place is kind of like a more casual version of Cheesecake Factory. Both of them feature a large variety of excellent menu selections (bound together in a spiral book, no less) and the atmosphere of each one just seems....nicer than your average restaurant chain. The main difference lies in BJs' emphasis on beer selection rather than Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake choices (alliteration is always awesome!), but I'm not really much of a beer drinker so I'm not really the one to review that side of things. If I WERE a beer drinker though, I'm sure I'd be pretty excited about the large selection these guys offer, especially since so many of them are on tap. They even give you a nice little menu that shows a sort of beer gradient from light to dark so you can easily tell what's what. Anyway, on to the food. The menu selections at BJ's are pretty diverse, including deep dish pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, soups, stuffed baked potatoes, seafood, fish tacos, pork chops, and more. I've been here several times and I've had a lot of different entrees but I still haven't come close to trying everything on the menu yet! By far, my favorite dish here is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which is a pair of chicken breasts coated with Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs before being pan fried. The white cheddar mashed potatoes they serve on the side are excellent. Yummy stuff here, guys. Thanks to the cold weather recently, I've also discovered a nice combination of items that warm me up every time: the Pale Ale Chili and the Gourmet Mac & Cheese. The chili alone could count as a meal because they serve it in a huge bowl, plus it has beans and chunks of pork and beef. Very hearty. The Mac & Cheese includes a few different cheeses and rotelle pasta (not actually macaroni) with bread crumbs and bacon on top. Also served in a tall bowl and is pretty filling on its own, and delicious besides. I've also tried their BBQ sandwich, a couple of different burgers, and their deep dish pizzas, all of which are tasty enough to recommend to others. I would also recommend the Pizookie for dessert, which is a big fresh-baked cookie with ice cream on top. They serve it in the little metal dish that it was baked in, which for some reason reminds me of something made in an Easy Bake Oven haha. Still, each type of Pizookie is pretty good although my two favorites are the chocolate chunk and peanut butter (which has actual peanuts cooked into the dough, mmmmmm). Service here has always been pretty good, especially the last time I was here a few weekends ago. It was a busy Sunday afternoon and our waiter was dealing with like 6 or 7 tables at once, but was handling it all very well. Even though he never seemed to stop moving, he was very genial and we were never left wanting for drink refills (nor was anyone else, as far as I can tell). Overall, definitely a restaurant I would recommend for people to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=80

Melissa S.,"Honolulu, HI",165,34,,5.0,8/26/2011,"Visited for the first time last week, ordered a small 5 meat pizza. The pie was delicious, toppings were portioned well. The ambiance and food were a 5. My brother ordered the mac and cheese as an appetizer and found a piece of 1/2 cooked plastic. He notified our server who apologized and replaced the item. The replacement was a 5 - served hot, delicious and tasty (and without plastic bits this time). What left a great deal to be desired was the way in which the restaurant manager handled the situation she approached our table looking frightened and said she was sorry, she didn't say what she was sorry for nor did she explain that we would not be billed for the mac and cheese. Before leaving she turned to my brother and said ""is there anything else?""  Our server returned to the table and asked if everything was to our satisfaction, she checked on my brother's mac and cheese which he said was yummy, she smiled and said ""good, is there anything else I can do to take care of you today?"" If I could give her 100 stars I would. Our server continued to check on us and made a point of refilling our drinks 3 times during the meal eventhough we didn't need them refilled. She was attentive, polite, responsive and she cared. The manager clearly mishandled the situation and needs retraining. This isolated incident didn't ruin our meal or my brother's birthday.  We intend on returning to the restaurant and hope the foreign object in the mac and cheese was an isolated incident.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=80

Normally, I'd give a place like this 2 stars based on the food because it's just mediocre chain restaurant food (think Applebee's or TGIFridays), but this place gets an extra star for their wide variety of beer and because they have a gluten free menu! I wanted to get something a little healthier [read: lighter in calories] and opted for the Chicken Lettuce Wraps as my entree even though it's listed under ""Appetizers to Share."" They're tasty and even though they're only 272 calories, it filled me up. If you are watching calories, don't be fooled into ordering a salad...some of their salads are over 1500 calories because of all the toppings and dressing! Because my boyfriend has Celiac, we're always happy to see a gluten free menu. He ordered a gluten free pizza, and it was actually very good! The crust was great and the 10"" pizza was satisfying. Everyone kept talking about the Pizookie, which is basically a large chocolate chip cookie baked in a mini deep dish pan until it's slightly crunchy on the outside and ooey-gooey on the inside. It's topped with two scoops of delicious vanilla bean ice cream. Split in half, it's about 850 calories for a portion...but since there was a gluten-free pizookie, we HAD to try it...calories, schmalories. Since I've taste-tested a lot of gluten free deserts and make them a lot at home, I can honestly say that BJ's did a great job on their gluten free pizookie! You can't tell that it's gluten free!!

Andy C.,"Cary, NC",84,413,913,3.0,3/25/2010,"Perfectly adequate dining experience.  I would give this place 4 stars but for the lackluster service that we received.  Perhaps it was due to the Sunday afternoon crowd, or just inexperience (as one of our servers was a trainee), but please note that the three stars is an overall rating and not indicative of just the food.  On with the review: Location: 4 out of 5 This is subjective depending on where you are coming from.  It was down the street from our hotel when I stayed in Edmond, so no real complaints.  And if you want to walk off the calories, the mall is nearby.  Service: 2 out of 4 As I've already alluded to, this was the low point of the dining experience.  I admit, it WAS a Sunday afternoon, and as all God fearing Oklahomians do, they were getting their beer and food on.  Interesting note as I found out: the grocery stores in Oklahoma City (and maybe the State?) aren't allowed to sell beers past 3% abv.  Anyway, service was slow, and there was a disconnect between who our real servers were versus who was able to refill our drinks, etc. etc.   Quality of food: 4 out of 5 Honestly, quite impressed with this chain.  I had a burger and the pale ale chili, and I was supremely impressed with the chili.  Probably one of the best bowls I've had in the past 2 calendar years, so good work on that!  The burger wasn't anything that I'd distinctly remember, but it was definitely good.  Yum, bacon and cheese.  I think others at my table got the flatbread pizza, and they seemed to enjoy it.  Bottom line - I don't think you can really go wrong with the food here. Quality of beer: 3 out of 5 Ooooh, and this is where the wheels almost fell off of the bus.  When I have a burger, I want one beer and one beer only, and that's a pale ale.  Don't care what variation: India, American, English - I just want something bitter and bold, but without overwhelming my palette at the very end.  The house version of the pale ale was I thought, a little demure in its flavor profile - similar to something that I've been able to brew at home.  However, I found that it was also quite easy to drink, and because of my good experience with the ale in the chili, in the end I didn't have anything to complain about.  Am I saying that I can't buy something similar in the stores?  Absolutely not.  Give me a Dogfish Head 60 or 90 minute IPA any day, or even a Sierra Nevada.  But I am saying that when local, it's good to drink local beer, and in the end, the pale ale here wasn't terrible.   Pricing: 3 out of 5 Commensurate with anywhere else you'd eat that resembles a restaurant/brewery.   Overall: 3 out of 5 Again, the service was untoward, the food was decent, and perhaps next time I'd like to try a different beer.  Can't say that I was unhappy with the experience, and I'd definitely go back again to give them another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city?start=100
