Lea M.,"Dallas, TX",26,112,255,5.0,6/25/2017,"Excellent location! Bf and I came here after a long day of shopping at Willowbend Mall. :))) We were tired and starving. We were seated immediately and ordered some drinks right away. The margarita and cucumber reviver (non alcoholic &a super refreshing) were excellent. The California fields salad, buffalo chicken salad and sausage and pepperoni pizza were amazing! Our waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient. We will definitely come back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Julie M.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,5,,3.0,12/21/2017,"Okay. Food delicious. But they keep getting rid of the BEST food on the menu. First to go was the BEST pizza EVER!! There WAS a southwest mix vegetable grill with Japanese eggplant, red bell pepper, green bell peppers with mozzarella and goat cheese (mmmm but gone). Flat bread with Italian salsa (mmmm but no more). Italian soda with acia blackberries and seltzer water (mmmm yes gone too). And now they took my Tiramisu away. The Tiramisu was better there than anywhere else and now it's gone.  The margarita pizza is still there and better than anywhere. Still good but not as good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Jocquelyn P.,"Lewisville, TX",160,60,143,5.0,8/15/2017,"I had great service today! My waitress was super nice and my food came out pretty quickly today.

Robyn A.,"Denton, TX",181,50,54,4.0,1/23/2017,"Someone posted the Pear Gorgonzola on facebook last week and I just had to get here and have it. OMG it's for sure one of my most favorite pizzas ever! I shared it with my mom, as well as the waldrof salad.  I wish there was one of these closer to me, because I would definitely come more. The man that waited on us was nice, but the management staff was what was impressive. We never had a drink get close to empty and they consistently check on us, but not the way some people annoy. They were genuine and it was, like I said, very impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Vanessa W.,"Plano, TX",119,116,264,5.0,2/26/2017,"I always love the Plano location, it is definitely better than the frisco location in my opinion. Willowbend gets a lot less traffic than Stonebriar, so it's so much calmer and the service is better in this location. Service is always great, and if we are having any problems with food then the manager will step in and help us. We have had good experiences with the managers and staff members.  My favorite is the pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza and overtime it has gotten a lot spicier! I am sensitive to spice, and I remember once having to take it back because I couldn't enjoy it. They haven't been as spicy lately but it still has a kick to it. They have also started to add a lot more oregano on the pizzas so I have to ask for light oregano. I love the wheat bread on the pizza, it has a nice sweet taste to it and of course it is a better option than the white bread. I always order a side of marinara with my pizza because I love dipping :) The drinks are expensive (around $9-10 each) but they are so delicious. Margaritas are always great (either frozen or on the rocks) and the Moscow Mule is great! Great spice and flavor, but a lot of ice!!  They renovated the restaurant a few years ago, and it has a much more hip and contemporary vibe. Everything from the tables, to the floors are renewed to wood and created a much needed updated atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Rex M.,"Richardson, TX",1206,192,2318,5.0,5/15/2016,"This place has always been a favorite and special treat. My manager and I met here and had a GREAT time. Menu had many new non pizza options Great lunch special combinations  I could make a meal of the crusty Italian breed a dipping garlic oil but why if your boss is paying? The side salad was huge, fresh and full of vegetables Good tart salad dressing The mushroom and sausage pizza was delicious and perfectly cooked Wonderful service, tea never went empty The interior is what you would expect at The Shops At Willow Bend..... modern, clean and stylish Low lighting and great soundproofing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Hannah C.,"Paramus, NJ",197,128,92,4.0,3/11/2016,"Out of all the locations I've ever been to in my lifetime, this one reigns supreme. Their salads are phenomenal (and I don't usually say that about salads because they tend to be so one dimensional.) My favorite is the Chicken Waldorf with dressing on the side. They offer gluten-free options which is great for my toddler who has food allergies.  It's pristinely clean and serves as the perfect lunch spot after shopping around Willow Bend. Service was above average. Our waitress was courteous and quick on her feet. I will most definitely frequent this location primarily for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Puja D.,"Austin, TX",318,1,,1.0,2/20/2017,"My family has gone to this location a hundred times. Today my mom went to pick up two salads- one with turkey and the other with no meat since my mom is vegetarian by religion.  This order was to go and it took over an hour for us to get the food and when we got the salads they both had meat. So they had to remake it. And the MANAGER, Will Wilson, is the one that came out to handle this order.  He complained to her ""is this an allergy or a preference?"" and my mom responded saying it is a preference. He responded it ""it's not going to KILL you"" with a sassy attitude.  He comes back with the order remade and my mom clarified that it has no meat again and he assured us with so my confidence that there was no meat. We come home and there is still chicken in her salad. He LIED. The manager LIED.  I called the store to speak to the manager to find out that he was the manager. He said it was not his fault and when things are made in the kitchen they get ""mixed up"" and I explained if it is an allergy or a preference the consumers request of no meat should still be met - not a response that it won't kill you.  Not only will my mom not be able to have her dinner, but we also had to deal with a rude, sassy manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Vivian N.,"Richardson, TX",247,339,77,5.0,7/26/2016,"I rarely go to any restaurant for pizza let alone a pizza place, but CPK is an exception. There are many options here instead of just pizza. There's also salads, pasta, entrees, and appetizers. Also, the drinks are great. The staff is always super welcoming and nice. The food is always delicious and what's awesome is that they have many gluten free options. Just remember to ask for the gluten free menu since the main menu doesn't show many options.  I usually get pizzas since they're easier to eat and reheat as well. Some of my favorites are the Thai Chicken, the Margherita, and the Spicy Chipotle Chicken. The gluten free pizza crust is a little sweeter and chewier than the regular crust, but it's still pretty good. Their salads are also great. When I'm not feeling like scarfing down carbs, I'll get the Thai salad. Beware. The portions are huge. If you want left over salad for the next two days, go ahead and get the full. The drinks are good. My favorite is the bluberry ginger smash. It contains whiskey and is super sweet. I also love their Moscow mules, I mean what is there to dislike about Moscow mules? Overall, I would highly recommend this place. If you are looking for decent drinks and non classic pizzas, definitely stop by here. What's great is that it is connected to the mall which means that I can shop and stop by for dinner without having to drive around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Cynthia C.,"Carrollton, TX",37,637,599,4.0,10/31/2015,"I normally go to the Willow Bend (Plano) location and they changed management, so the menu and decor of the restaurant has changed quite a bit. I love their food and they have a variety of salads, pizza, pasta, etc. Definitely a great lunch spot and they do a lot of promotions where you can score free appetizers.  The only reason for 4/5 stars is because the food is inconsistent. The food quality is the same, but I had once ordered a mushroom pizza and the first time it came out with a few sliced mushrooms on each slice and the second time had shaved mushrooms so that it covered the entire slice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Shannah H.,"Plano, TX",243,728,1120,5.0,5/23/2015,"Just a quick note about the service here - All. Star. I've always liked CPK pizza, though I don't usually go unless I'm with a group so I can do some pizza mixing and matching. However, last week I was with a group that had to put together a last-minute luncheon on a very tight budget. We called CPK at 11:15 a.m., picked up pizzas, salad and dessert for 40 people at 11:45 a.m. and had everything laid out and ready for lunch at noon. Amazing. What place does that kind of turnaround for a group when they're already entering the lunch rush? A great place, that's who.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Kelsey S.,"Carrollton, TX",179,213,708,2.0,2/27/2015,"I came here with a friend who used to work at a different CPK location because she always raved about the mac & cheese there so we finally went so I could try it. The location is nice, and clean, but the service was lacking. A bunch of employees standing behind the bar doing nothing. The house bread they bring out is hard in a stale way...so that was a bad start. So was the dirty silverware. The bianca(?) flatbread we started with was ok but I didn't like how pungent the cheese was. The chicken lettuce wraps were underwhelming, I can get better at Pei Wei. We asked for crispy chicken on our mac & cheese and they only threw a few little scratch chicken crisps on top so we had to ask for more actual pieces of chicken. The pasta itself didn't look like mac & cheese because it was just spiral noodles on top of a little spoonful of watered down white sauce. So we had to ask for more cheese. After much doctoring, it was decent. Then there was a whole fiasco with us being overcharged and it took literally 20 minutes to get it fixed. Oi. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Brandon B.,"Dallas, TX",88,41,147,5.0,1/25/2016,"""Alongside classics like the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza, highlights of CPK's new menu include a juicy Fire Grilled Ribeye cooked with house-made pinot noir sea salt, topped with creamy bleu cheese butter and served with roasted fingerling potatoes and lemon-garlic wild arugula salad. This ribeye was unexpected but not underwhelming; Tender, flavorful, juicy! Who knew a pizza kitchen would also have some of the first-rate steak? Another new favorite is the Hearth-Roasted Halibut, wild caught from Alaska and roasted on a cedar plank with butternut squash farro, grilled asparagus and baby kale. This is one of the most popular of the new menu items and after the first mouthful it is not hard to see why. The halibut is offset with the sweet butternut squash farro while the grilled asparagus and baby kale bring the fresh greens to the dish.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Barbara W.,"Carrollton, TX",16,62,12,5.0,7/25/2017,"Went for lunch with my family.  I remember going to a CPK in the late 80's in Tyson's Corner, VA when it was the newest hot restaurant.  I've also visited several times in DFW but it's been a while.  The restaurant was not that busy, but we were there for a late lunch.  Our service was good.  The kitchen was not incredibly quick, but since the pizzas are made to order, that is understandable.  Not a place to go for a 30 min lunch, but they do have online ordering.  Two of us had the barbecue chicken pizza.  Really tasty and the crust was nice too.  Also ordered salads and soups.  Everyone was happy with their food, which makes for a nice lunch.  It's just a good place to take both the picky eaters and the more adventurous.  Good choices for all.  They have a special right now that you get a 20% off coupon for a future visit in the next 7 days.  Not sure how long that promo lasts, but we will try to make it back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Teresa M.,"McKinney, TX",16,6,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Usually this location is wonderful.  We have preferred it over the Frisco location.  Today wasn't the case.  The plates came out dirty with dried bits of food on them.  After 3 attempts to bring a clean one, with the last one still having dried food on it, I asked to speak to the manager.  He said that the plate was sanitary and that it was just like when my dishwasher at home might miss some plates.  I couldn't bring myself to eat the salad.  Hopefully they will get their problem fixed soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,3.0,8/4/2015,"It seems like the quality of service you get here is hit or miss. Unfortunately, when I went with my friend and our kids it was a definite miss. The restaurant was almost empty on a Saturday around lunch time (weird!) and we were seated immediately. I will say that the hostess was super nice! Then our waiter showed up and he instantly seemed irritated by us because we had kids with us. Hey, I get it, kids are messy and you don't want a bunch of crumb crushers at your table, but at least be polite? We ordered an appetizer and our drinks and the waiter disappeared and didn't show back up for about ten minutes. When he brought out the bianco flatbread we had ordered there were still no drinks, so we reminded him and then he didn't even apologize - just walked off without a word and came back with our drinks. I had put down a place mat for both our toddlers and made sure to cut up her food so she didn't make too big a mess. The other toddler didn't even eat. The bianco has a super strong basil flavor because each segment is cooked with a whole leaf on it, and so make sure you're pro-basil before you order it.  When we got the pizza it was the same issue. My drink had been empty for 5-10 mins, and our waiter had been completely absent from the dining room. It was so crazy quiet in there I had no idea why we weren't at least being checked on occasionally. When he came with the pizza I asked for a refill, same attitude. The white pizza was tasty but had a really powerful garlic taste that kind of overwhelmed the pizza, I hate to say that the frozen pizza version from CPK was actually better than the real thing at this location. Finally we were done and wanted to pay, and I ended up having to track down a different server to ask for the check. They told me they'd have to find our server, and so I described him. I was able to clean up the table and the floor before he finally came up with the check. For mediocre food and mediocre service, I feel gracious giving 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2

The service was mediocre because it was very busy, but our server didn't look like she had more than 3 tables of 4 or less people.  This location is connected to Willow Bend mall, so it's not an independent building.  The atmosphere was pretty boring, actually. Nothing decorative on the walls. . . Nothing decorative anywhere, actually. The only thing that looked interesting was the open kitchen, and you have to sit at the bar to even see all that. This place is worth it for the food if you are in the area or live around there, but don't go out of your way to plan a gathering to meet people up there. The atmostphere makes it NOT worth it.

Harry got a basic pepperoni pizza with extra pepperoni on the whole grain honey wheat crust. I got the chipotle chicken, also on the whole grain crust. They were both good, but nothing special.

Delia R.,"Frisco, TX",179,77,317,3.0,1/17/2011,"California Pizza Kitchen, or CPK, was recently named one of Forbes Magazine's 'Best 200 Small Companies', and named the #1 most recommended casual dining restaurant chain by Zocalo Group and Marc research. Many visits by this diner have proven that not only are there countless tasty pizza selections, but CPK also masters many other dishes as well. For the not-so hungry diner, they now offer the appropriately named 'Small cravings' menu, featuring: white corn guacamole with chips, korean bbq steak tacos, and spicy chicken tinga quesadillas. Their Thai Crunch salad is a popular choice among CPK-lovers, which is not so much as salad, as it is a hearty entree'. The salad contains shredded cabbage,grilled chicken breast, cucumbers, edamame,  crispy wontons, rice sticks, peanuts, cilantro,  carrots and green onions tossed with lime-cilantro and authentic Thai peanut dressing. Pizza is, of course, the specialty of the kitchen here. Some pizza menu highlights include: Roasted Artichoke and Spinach Pizza, Cheeseburger Pizza with ground Angus beef, the original BBQ Chicken Pizza, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza, and Thai Chicken Pizza. Must stop listing pizza now for fear of sounding like Forrest Gump. Bottom line is: Yes, it's a chain, but their pizza is de-lish. Honey-wheat whole grain crust is available upon request for any pizza. Thai chicken, chipotle chicken, original bbq chicken pizza, CPK offers a call-ahead wait list, online ordering, curbside service, and delivery service for a small fee.

For the price of the pizza,  you don't get a big portion but it's just right for two people who aren't ravenously hungry.  I really like their honey wheat crust -  it's very grainy and adds great texture to the pizza! I also love how they let you have half orders of different kinds of pizza - I'm big on trying new things and being indecisive, so this option was perfect for me.  Tonight I shared a half wild mushroom pizza and a  half spicy chipotle chicken pizza.  The crust was brushed with oil, which is more grease than I prefer but it wasn't a crazy amount. I liked the mild flavor of the mushroom pizza and the meatiness that those delectable little fungi added.  The chipotle chicken pizza was quite spicy and came with a great corn salad on top.  At first, I didn't think three pieces could fill me up but they surely did! Split two ways, this was a very affordable meal, but it could easily add up with appetizers and drinks and desserts, so just keep that in mind! The service was good - our server was polite and prompt, but didn't keep an eye on our waters so I was yearning for another glass after I had some of that fiery chipotle pizza! Other than that, they did a great job and I would definitely recommend coming here if you need a place to rest your feet after shopping up a storm at Willow Bend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2?start=40

Im kind of a stickler for customer service and this place just didnt do it for me starting with the indifferent hostess to the oblivious waitress. That being said the pizza was good. Just good. It seemed a little overpriced. I would rather go to BJs Brewouse and get a better pizza and service for less money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2?start=60

I always get their fajita pizza with pico di gallo. I forget it's name but I love it. It's always delicious. I dabble with their drinks and appetizers, but I always come back to the pizza.

Drinkable, but not good. We had the dumplings as a starter and they were pretty good. We got a white pizza and a wild mushroom pizza. The wild mushroom was pretty good - the white was a little too salty for me.

I had a Speciality Raspberry Italian Soda.  I asked for a ""Cream Soda"" but they brought the cream in a little creamer cup on the side.  That was fine... at least they left room at the top for me to add the cream in.  I love Italian Cream Sodas. I think I enjoyed the dumplings more than Jenn.  I am a professed Ginger-aholic and the dipping sauce was hitting at all the right spots.  This was what I remembered from 2 1/2 years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed my wild mushroom pizza.  I had one piece of Jen's White Pizza, and it was good too, and took another piece home in my to go box. Granted... it's NOT Star Pizza from Houston...

Lauren C.,"The Colony, TX",532,42,6,2.0,11/29/2015,"Came here last night with my boyfriend. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and I decided to get the fresh agave margarita.  When the margarita came I was disgusted- there was a fruit fly in the top of the margarita.  I told our sever (who gave us great service by the way) and he took the drink, but didn't apologize, just said he would get me another one.  While we waited for my drink, the appetizer was yummy but I couldn't stop thinking about the fly in my margarita. My boyfriend joked and said I could use a little extra protein.  I got my new margarita and it was fabulous along with our pizza and chicken piccata dish.  To my dismay, when we got the bill, the fly margarita was still on there. I work in the restaurant industry and if anything like that would happen to a drink, I would comp it immediately and get the customer another drink.  we did get a very ""sad"" apology from the manager- sad meaning she acted like she didn't give two shits.  We probably won't be back because the whole paying for a drink with a fly in it left a bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2?start=20

We were seated right away and asked for our drink order right away. The sweet tea was amazing. Not even five minutes later our server, Tony, asked for our order. I ordered the five cheese with tomato. My mother ordered spring rolls. About two minutes later my tea was gone and he showed up with tea and complimentary bread. The bread was sour dough and it came with olive oil. I read one of the other reviews saying it was stale, but it's just a hard, crunchy bread. He also asked us to pick a complimentary small plate and he would take care of it. We chose the Mac and cheese. Not even ten minutes later it was all in front of us, both of our entrees and the Mac and cheese. It was all mouth watering. We were pretty much full less then halfway through our meal so we have some amazing leftovers. Then we ordered dessert, and that was very yummy too.

Perhaps if the 40-something manager would stop flirting with the 20-something female staff long enough to see our guy was waiting on the entire dining room, our waiter would have been more attentive.  MANAGER - suggested he had no idea where the hair came from. ""All my prep cooks have shaved heads."" I guess he was too busy looking at other features of his female wait staff, because 2 of them had lovely and long strawberry hair!!  He comped our food (we paid for our drinks) and he pretty much accused us of planting the hair - what a classy guy.   Yes, Mr. Manager, it is my mission in life to go to restaurants (with a sewing needle in hand), strategically place hair in food that I am not going to eat, and then insist on not paying for it. Oh, but I will pay for wine that I can no longer drink because that's part of faking the ""feeling nauseous"" bit.  Really?!? We will NOT be returning to this location.

Chris L.,"Dallas, TX",194,878,245,3.0,4/28/2011,"You have different expectations when you visit a chain restaurant. You give them leniency and you respect them for consistency and sometimes value.  I also usually dislike pizza because i'm health conscience and it doesn't impress me like various different global ethnic foods: thai, indian, vietnamese, korean, etc. Californial Pizza Kitchen (CPK) differs from the ordinary affair of chained restaurants. Their ambience and food gives totally elevates the common-place pizza and gives the pizza a modern twist. The food and menu is light and provides lots of great health conscience options. California Pizza kitchen is a treat to visit. I wanted to give them 3.5 stars but i really can't. Yelp doesn't give half stars. I went there for lunch after a trip to the mall with the lady. She's a huge fan of California Pizza Kitchen. She always gets the white pizza. Service: My waitress was very pleasant and knowledgeable. The menu at CPK is enormous. It seems that the best choices and picks have to be a pizza (obvious) or a salad.  Food: The pizzas are personal size. I have an above average appetite by standards of physicians. I eat more than i should. I ended up eating most of my pizza.  So if you're wondering about portion size it may be a good idea to order a pizza for yourself if you're a 165lb guy like me. I ended up ordering the greek pizza. It is very delicious. The crust is crunchy but a little chewy. I don't mind it. it's not ideal but still enjoyable. The pizza is topped with feta cheese, chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes and olives. The topping pairing makes it taste like a gyro. The chicken is cooked pretty well; not overcooked or dry at all. Now what makes the pizza is the tiziki (sp) or gyro sauce. It provides a good balance and level of moisture the pizza needs. They provide you with the sauce as well so you can dip or spread to your hearts content.  The pizza comes with the option of wheat; which i opted for. You can also get it in thin crust if you're carb conscience.  She ordered her favorite white pizza. I had a slice. It's got alot of garlic taste. It's not overpowering surprisingly. It's topped with lots and lots of cheese and chicken. The food took a while to make; but so do pizzas. Ambience: There's not too much to this place; it's located at the dead-end of the willow bend mall; near DSW (i know this because she wanted to return shoes).  My only complaint is the flies problem. There were two; It was a little annoying; just not a huge problem. Value: For two we ended up spending around 30 bucks after tip. I think it was worth it. The food was enjoyable and so was the service. Overall i would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2?start=20
