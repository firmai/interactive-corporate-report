The waitress had a nasty attitude at first and that ticked us off, but she actually smiled halfway through the service so I guess that was better than nothing. I got the Jack Daniel's sirloin and shrimp and there was no shrimp on my plate so I had to give it back which was pretty annoying. I can say that the BBQ chicken flatbread was good but I was disappointed with the size of my sirloin and the small lump of french fries and one small piece of broccoli for my sides.

The guy even kinda apologized for another customer who was being kind of rude an obnoxious. He seemed to take everything in stride. In fact, when we came back the next day (can you believe it?! Two days in a row.) he remembered us and asked if we wanted our ""same table"".

I ordered Jack Daniels Salmon with Grilled Shrimp Scampi. Tasty - big complaint shrimp is grilled fully in shell - makes it dry, hard to get to meat.  Also comes with grilled corn bread - yet grill in this case was burnt. To have to convince the waiter who says ""it is suppose to come crispy"". Maybe so but black and charred is way too crispy.  Also teach a bartender how to make a margarita  Adequate for a cheaper me The above was a few months - there new renovation has lead to them playing loud - very loud - rock music.

The two happy hours are nice, especially the one from 10 til close. they offer 4 dollar long island ice teas during this happy hour.

25,Wayne W.,"Annapolis, MD",0,49,,3.0,2014-08-17,"2.5 star experience when I dined today. Suprisingly, this TGI Fridays usually is on point so today was an off day. Two issues today. First was they advertised on their board by the front door a Sunday special....half price appetizers. Awesome! I've gotten this special before at my table and it really is a great deal. Sadly, it seems they changed this special to a ""bar area only"" special. Except they advertised it in a non-bar area and did not mention anywhere on the board the special had limited seating areas in which this would be honored. So my table couldn't partake. I expressed my disappointment that my table was excluded but the table that was making eye contact with me an arm lengths away could, but to no avail. My waiter said we could move to the bar area, but that would require my party getting back in line to be seated. Really? And stand with our bar drinks (since they have no problem spreading THOSE bar items to any table in the building...did that sound snarky? Eh, I stand by it.) No, thank you. While my table remained friendly the entire time, I feel the waiter assumed we were going to be difficult and just found other places to be for most of our meal. So service was a negative today. Again, usually I have good experiences with the staff here.  Just an FYI that has nothing to do with my rating. The 2 for $12/$16 options have changed to a massacred, wimpy version of its former self. Gone are most of the good choices that made you go ""wow, that's a great deal"" or even ""wow, so many good sounding options."" Now, you'll probably check out the full, higher priced menu more carefully. That's not bad in itself, but may have Friday's lose some of the bang for your buck it had going for it. So 2.5 today and prior experiences being 4 stars, comes to a (possibly too low) 3 stars. I'll be back, but I may have to play 21 questions with the host to guarantee I am in a seat that has all of the options Friday's has to offer available to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis?start=40,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

The food not so much...Stopped in last Sat. night because they were the only restaurant open past 11pm besides the usual fast food joints. Sat at the bar and ordered something called shrimp and chicken pasta with cream sauce. I looked at it when the foodrunner dropped it off and thought it was a soup. Pasta was drowning in sauce. I was starving so I gave it a try and it was completely void of any taste. Funny thing is I told the bartender that I was not a fan of it and that I would like to order something else. He looked at me as though I had run over his puppy or something. ""What's the problem?"" he asked. I explained it to him and I got a nasty look.

32,Lee D.,"Pasadena, MD",1,93,12.0,3.0,2017-02-18,"Incredibly average. I'm beginning to dislike this chain as my experiences across a range of sites are consistently blah.  Mediocre food, distracted, poorly trained service is disappointing from a restaurant I've been coming to for over 20 years. Only bright spot was the naan-which.  I actually liked the dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

Fried string beans always excellent. My burger and wifes mahi mahi sandwich were large and good. Love their fries too.

The food was very delicious. The restaurant atmosphere was very homey. I recommend coming here since this was our first time as well, but that just show how good the place is .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

8,Mich S.,"Washington, DC",64,23,7.0,1.0,2017-04-27,Slow service unfortunately was the downfall. 3 out 4 meals showed up first. Our 4th meal showed up around 7 minutes later. Not a lot of teamwork. Not a manager in sight.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
7,Christina H.,"Lusby, MD",0,35,,4.0,2017-08-16,Our waiter Sasha was very good. Alway attentive and very nice. We got the endless apps though I should have just ordered mine off the regular app menu since the amount I got was the same. I paid $12 for something I could have gotten for $9. Not their fault though. The potstickers are always good and so are the wings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

I did the $15 endless appetizer option since I could decide what to get and was in the mood for small plates. I had the BBQ flatbread, the pot stickers, the loaded potato skins, and the chicken quesadilla.  The BBQ flatbread and the pot stickers were really good and flavorful! The loaded potato skins were just okay. The chicken quesadilla was also really good and had a lot of flavor!  Perfect deal for someone who is indecisive about what they want!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
1,Tyler S.,"Annapolis, MD",7,110,103.0,3.0,2017-11-03,"Grab 2 special for $15 was a good deal.  I got two half racks of ribs, plus onion rings and mac n cheese.  Ribs were tasty, but I've had more succulent.  Onion rings were very good. My wife had the french dip sandwich, which had an odd after taste.  She loved the fries, though.  Soft drinks and iced tea were good. Server was friendly and quick.  We sat in the side dining room facing the parking lot, which has big bright windows.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

3,Chris B.,"Federalsburg, MD",53,5,1.0,2.0,2017-12-27,The service was too slow during happy hour on a Wednesday which shouldn't be. Our server sucked. I've eaten/worked at many restaurants and this is by far the worst one. I've eaten at the Dover DE location and the service there was better.

2,Tim T.,"Huntingtown, MD",11,246,844.0,4.0,2017-12-29,Friday's is a good place to goto for a good lunch or dinner all of the meals that have the JD sauce are very good this stuff would even make anchovies taste good. I wish they had one in Calvert county going to Waldorf (not an area that is really safe anymore) or annapolis for dinner is a long drive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
