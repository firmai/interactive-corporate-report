Nathan N.,"Houston, TX",31,309,155,4.0,1/7/2018,"I guess that I need to get out more, because I did not know this place existed! It is only about six minutes from my house...well, anyway I know now. They make their own beer! I tried a few and really liked one-Jeremiah Red. The burgers and pizzas were spot on too. This is a good place to go if you have older kids or just want to hang out with a few friends for a couple (OK, a few) beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Mark B.,"Houston, TX",416,313,2206,4.0,11/2/2017,"Met some friends here for lunch, I had been to a few BJ's locations but never this one. I had also never tried their pizza.  I went with the Gourmet Five Meat deep dish. This was a serious pizza! Two pieces and I was done. I was able to make four meals out of the one pizza, which was good because at $26.25 it was the most expensive pizza I've ever had. Worth it thou.  They brought out a three prong pizza stand for the table and it had magnets on it and the pizza pan was metal...genius! I am always worried about the entire pizza sliding off those, but this one was going no where.   Also had a Cream Soda which was fantastic.  As we were leaving the manager told us that pizzas are half off on Mondays, just might have to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Rosy P.,"Houston, TX",14,176,2453,5.0,9/24/2017,"This is one of the few restaurants open late in Pearland. They're famous for their Pizookies and rightly so. Those cookie desserts are awesome! My favorite is the triple chocolate with Ghirardelli pizookie. It's so good!!! I ventured out and tried the Cookies and Cream pizookie today and it just didn't compare.  There are a wide variety of entrees here. The burgers are good. So is the pizza. Their artichoke and spinach dip is cheesy, melty goodness. The soups are served in bread bowls - my husbands favorite! They have specials Monday thru Thursday's.  Their kids menu is full of variety also. Lots to choose from for even the pickiest eater. If you get a waiter/waitress that's really good, your kid also gets the kids appetizer - a small fruit cup and bread roll. Sometimes we get it, sometimes we don't. Today we did and my son was happy about that!  Decor is nice and simple. The atmosphere is lively but not too distracting. Good food. Good people. It's easy to see why they have repeat business here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Tom B.,"Rosharon, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,I don't understand how many times we come here and wait for tables despite looking around at an empty restaurant. The hostess' here absolutely suck. Servers aren't much better. Told 20 minute wait and still here at 50 minutes waiting in front. Last time we come here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Belly G.,"Houston, TX",616,836,4932,2.0,9/14/2016,"I haven't been to a BJ's in forever until this time and let's just say that I was very underwhelmed. I came in a group of six and this was during the UH Cougars and OU Sooners football game, so of course I wanted to watch it. Told the hostess to seat us where we (specifically me) could watch the game. We were told to wait about five minutes and then we were seated at the corner booth on the right side (if you're looking in) of the restaurant. Not in the main floor where there are TVs all over the place, but in the restaurant wing where's there's only three TVs in the whole room. If that's not bad enough, in the middle of the booth, between my eyes and the TV, there's a hanging chandelier that made it really hard for me to watch the game. Yes, there are other TVs in other sides of the restaurant, but these TVs aren't big enough for me to be able to see the score, or to see what the hell is going on during the game. Enough rant! On to the food and service!! Food: I ordered a basic bacon cheeseburger. The patty - bland. Totally flavorless like they didn't put anything on the patty - just slab the meat on the grill, put it on the bun, add bacon and vegges, and done! Meh. Service - Our waiter was okay. Not great, not fast, not super slow either. However, prior to use leaving, one of my friends asked for his drink to go. THIS never happened. We waited a little bit after we all signed our CC checks to see if he'd come back, but nope. I even got up and looked around to see if I could located him somewhere in the restaurant, but he was nowhere to be found either. Meh. As I stated above, my experience was underwhelming. Bland food and meh service.  So... meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Stew G.,Chicagoland,2,35,32,4.0,11/17/2017,"The menu is so big that you become undecided.  Not because there's not anything you want, but because there's too much that you want.    Sit at the bar and get a LightSwitch (3x) and the Grilled Cheese.  HONEST.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Monae I.,"Houston, TX",124,77,612,3.0,3/26/2017,"I took my friend here for the first time because I love BJ's, and I was a little upset with the bar service. Paul started off as a good bartender, but the service went downhill after my friend didn't like his drink & my Parmesan knots were hard as rocks.

Michelle M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",95,138,272,3.0,2/27/2017,"Dined here twice; Sat at the bar for wine & salad on a Sunday afternoon. Bartender was very friendly, but service could have been better. She was very busy cleaning up from the night before (not her fault) but it took her away from serving me and others thoroughly. I really enjoyed my bbq chicken salad, it was loaded with fresh flavors and was a perfect lunch portion. It did take almost 20 minutes to receive my salad, so don't go there in a hurry. See pic. Sunday dinner party of 5....very very slow service, had to ask multiple times for drink refills. We were constantly flagging down our waiter the entire night. At one point he literally disappeared - had to ask our busser for our waiter in order for us to place our dinner order. Ridiculous. The food redeemed the experience a little bit. I had Mediterranean chicken tacos, very good, I'd definitely order them again. Others at our table enjoyed their meals, except for hubby who had the $15.00 prime rib sandwich. Under seasoned and too heavy on the cheese.  3 stars for food quality, but -2 because of service issues both times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Phylicia F.,"Houston, TX",195,32,63,5.0,11/19/2016,"Can I give this 10 stars!!! Last night my fiancé just moved to the Pearland area and have visited the BJ's a few times. However, last night was absolutely incredible!!! Our server was Robin and she was a pure breathe of fresh air. She gave service from her heart. You can tell she enjoyed her job. She knew the menu and even after my fiancé ordered the wrong beer she happily switched him. I mean from that to the perfect appetizer, to helping me decide on my entree. I couldn't have left happier!  I did ask to speak to the Manager on Duty- Katy who was just as pleasent!  From now on I'm only sitting in Robins section! If you visit this location, ASK FOR ROBIN!!!!!! You won't be disappointed! My FAVORITE BJS experience so far!  P.S.

Sarah I.,"Pearland, TX",50,1,,1.0,5/27/2017,"This is not our first time here and every time before the service has been great. Today, it was terrible!! Our waitress had to be asked for water every time, she never asked for another alcoholic drink which they usually do, we asked for to go boxes 4 times, my salad was wrong, the Avacado in the egg rolls were brown, the sweet potato fries were super salty, our tickets took forever to get, half our food came out and the other half took another 10 minutes at least, we had to ask for sauces (ranch, sour cream, etc) 3 times. When we talked to the manager and he didn't seem to care too much. We were not expecting perfect service since it was graduation weekend but we have been in here several times before when they were PACKED and had way better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Kayte S.,"Alvin, TX",2,1,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"Was craving avocado egg rolls to take home for lunch, I ordered that along with a cookies n cream pzookie since they were only $3. Half way through eating the egg rolls at home noticed some of my egg rolls burnt which the first half wasn't that great at all either. Saved the pzookie for a few hours later and opened it up to the sad excuse of a cookie don't even think it was cooked all the way. BJ's has always been my go to restaurant when I can't decide... But today was the absolute worst experience for take out and quality/taste of food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Rosa S.,"Houston, TX",54,14,24,4.0,5/20/2017,"BJ's is becoming one of my favorite spots to go or to pick up orders from! Love their easy to go through app! Love that we can pick up the tab through the app! Their food is fresh, and always served at the right temperature. Loved their Quinoa and Shrimp entrée, their Calamari appetizers. I don't eat vegan, but people that tried their Lemon Chicken Entrée, said it was delicious.Their kids meals are a bit on the high end pricing compared to other restaurants, but I would say that the kids meals portion is at least fair. Love the restaurant's ambiance. Modern decoration, spacious and clean. Their staff Is always friendly. The only thing that made me give it a 4 stars vs a 5 stars is the fact that waiters and waitresses tend to either come or forget about you LOL And another thing, I believe that whatever drink that has complimentary refill should always be refilled without a customer to have to wait to order it. Their curbside ordering is nice. You can order from the comfort of your home, and if like me it's a hassle to take kids down to go pick -up your order, it's nice that they have assigned parking spots where you park, dial the number on the sign and they get your order within minutes. I would definitely recommend BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Maddison A.,"Central Southwest, Houston, TX",153,12,10,5.0,10/7/2017,"So a friend and I went to BJ's on a Thursday and got the 1/2 rack rib special with two sides and a salad. Both of our meals were exceptional. She got the ribs with fresh green beans and white cheddar mashed potatoes with a Caesar salad. I had the same ribs with fresh green beans and sweet potato fries with a tomato and mozzarella salad. Let me say this... the mozzarella so fresh that even days later as I eat my left overs, I can still taste the freshness of the cheese. I have frequented BJ's plenty of times throughout the years and I just wanted to give credit where credit is due.

We only had a few drinks and cookies n cream, peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia pizookies They were fantastic!

John P.,"Houston, TX",20,136,119,4.0,8/20/2017,"My first visit to this location. Here to celebrate my in-laws 63rd wedding anniversary. Reagan is our server tonight. First thing we noticed, none of the salt shakers work. Looks like they are all wet inside. When we asked Reagan about this, she said,  that happens to all their salt shakers every night. I guess they haven't heard of putting rice into the salt shakers  Tortilla soup came out not quite hot enough; we sent it back. When it came back it was perfect. California chicken club was done perfectly and the fries came out extra crispy just as ordered.  Hamburger was good, but significantly more greasy then it should've been. My father-in-law had the ribs. He said they were good, but he likes Friday's ribs better. Sarah, the manager, brought out a fried beignets with whip cream for their anniversary. Reagan did an awesome job for her third day. Given some time and training she'll be a superstar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3
Crystal G.,"Houston, TX",138,69,228,3.0,1/5/2017,"I didn't know what to expect coming to BJs for the first time. It was a casual atmosphere and pretty comfortable. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was just okay. I probably wouldn't order it again. I ordered the seared ahi salad and it was good other than the ahi tasting very fishy(not fresh). We also got the guacamole burger with wedge fries and it was good, very tasty. Our waiter was very nice and polite.

Jose J.,"Houston, TX",0,1,4,5.0,1/7/2017,BEST BJ's EVER  Managers and waiters are really attentive  And the food here is delicious!

Tom M.,"Pearland, TX",32,67,6,1.0,10/23/2017,We hadn't been her in a while so we decided it would be something different and it was. Everything from the service to the food was bad. My wife ordered a Jalapeño burger and onion petals and I ordered a BJ's pizza. We also ordered two margaritas as they were $5 tonight. We waited about twenty minutes before they arrived. There was no salt on the rim and when my wife inquired the sever told us that the margaritas on special did not include salt. She then told us she would bring us glasses with salt and she did. Upon tasting the margaritas they were not very good to the point I didn't drink mine at all. The food arrived and my  pizza was luke warm where I could even hold the pan. My wife's burger was also barely warm and the onion straws were cold. At this point we didn't want to send anything back as we were tired and just wanted to go home. I have two daughters that are servers so I always tip well for good service and adequate for bad service. I can't say I'll return to BJ's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3

Manuel E.,"Pearland, TX",398,118,93,4.0,5/18/2016,"The restaurant is pretty nice. It has a dim and classy decor, which I love. There are TVs everywhere - The staff here is very nice and always attentive. Pretty good food for a slightly higher price ($18-20).  I feel it reminds me of Cheesecake Factory with their large portions of mostly American Food, however minus Cheesecake!!!   I did enjoy their BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, and their Thick cut fries (something hard to find). Their Chicken wings are pretty darn good too! -Traditional wings (appetizer): I love how they make theirs.  Crispy and not too oily.  I always order this.  They do have their Pizookie (think cookie with ice cream on top), which is the main reason you come to BJ's.  We got the triple cookie sampler and chose Cookies and Cream and Salted Caramel (both good) and Peanut Butter (not good, and I love peanut butter).  I do like you can get a sample of several flavors at least. I am happy to have this restaurant so close to my neighborhood! I give this place 2 thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=20
Jay Y.,"Houston, TX",656,1010,1822,4.0,5/8/2015,"Here are some reasons why you should plan your group dinner here: 1) Balanced ambiance between fancy and casual makes it fitting for most occasions 2) Diverse menu for American (new and traditional) and Italian cuisines that is guaranteed to have something for everyone in the group 3) Reasonable pricing (~$10 per entree) so no one busts his or her wallet 4) Solid food in nice portion to satisfy your entire group 5) Excellent service to ensure your dining experience is nothing short of great! BJ's is certainly a good dining spot for solo or family dining or a bar joint for sporting events, but I think this restaurant definitely shines as a top spot to plan a flawless group dinner! If this wasn't too far from my place, I would no doubt be a regular to this awesome restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=20
Justin T.,"Pearland, TX",1437,254,887,4.0,7/28/2015,"I have always been a fan of this restaurant.  Living in Houston, it is just so hard to frequent the same place when we live in a foodie town.  When my best friend said he was having a little birthday get together at BJ's, I got a little giddy.   I went to the Pearland location, which has never been a disappointment.  There was little to no wait, even with the size of our group.  We had a very friendly waitress, but the service was very slow.  That was the one factor that kept me from giving 5 stars.   Now we all know BJ's is known for their deep dish pizza, but on the particular visit, I went with the new Tavern Cut thin crust pizza.  Of course I still ate off other peoples deep dish just to get my fix.  I thought the thin crust pizza had great flavor, but it was not crispy as one would expect a thin crust to be.  I also ordered their own crafted root beer which was delicious.  You can not leave BJ's without having a pizooki for dessert.  I ordered the cookies and cream pizooki.  I have no complaint whatsoever about dessert.  I could probably eat a full size one if I didn't care about people judging me.

Jackie B.,"Pearland, TX",43,89,72,5.0,5/17/2017,"Dropped in for happy hour ""dinner"" yesterday.   We had never been and wanted to check it out.  We ordered the beef sliders, the root beer glazed ribs, and the cheese with chili dip and chips.   The cheese and chili dip was perfect.   Good flavor, good texture.  I though we would run out of chips, but then the other apps came!  The root beer glazed ribs were INCREDIBLE!  Nice and tender, with a fantastic taste.   Wasn't a huge fan of the slaw, but that's a personal taste. The big hit was the sliders.   We added cheddar and bacon (NO upcharge).   They came on the Hawaiian rolls.   Patties looked hand formed.   So tasty and juicy!  I wasn't expecting them to be THAT good.   And the fries were a good compliment (which we dipped in the cheese dip!!) Overall it was very very good.   Service was great.   And to top it off, the food bill was only $15!!!   Can't beat that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=20

She replenished drinks a lot. Unfortunately we had to send 2 burgers back as they were raw in the middle. (Ordered medium) The burgers were replaced but this ruined the dynamic of our whole experience with 2/4 people having their entrees and 2 having to send theirs back especially with us having our 10 month old baby who began to get fussy.  The burgers came back later and were probably over cooked to medium-well instead of medium to compensate for the 1st issue of them being raw.  On another note, I am Not sure if the recipe of the burgers has changed or if it is the method of cooking them - but I noticed a 'chemical' char taste, can't really describe it but it didnt seem right. Great service, shame about the 2 burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=20

Samuel T.,"Houston, TX",1,34,8,2.0,10/17/2016,"I'm rating this place low, because of the ridiculous wait times and what was told to us. Our group came in on a Sunday afternoon, and I understand the Sunday rush. However, we were told by the hostess that the wait time was 20 minutes. We waited for 90 minutes! Because we were trying to have a lunch meeting, we opted out of leaving this place. Every so often, we were told that they were getting our tables ready, but to no avail.  We were finally seated and served. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, but it was nothing amazing. I think the long wait really dampened our experience. We were hungry and frustrated.  I'm giving 2 stars, because the Chocolate Chunk Mini Pazookie was really good and filling.  The service could be much better. I asked our waiter for utensils, and he kept forgetting. The servers also didn't know what they were serving, and had to keep going back to the kitchen to check.

I'm not a big fan of their pizzas so I ordered my usual Cesar salad topped with buffalo chicken. And let the shenanigans begin! There is an interesting mix of people that frequent this location for one reason or another, and for that reason alone, I had a good time. We ended up chatting with the bartender (Hispanic guy, I apologize since I forgot his name) and some regulars on everything from real estate to the arts and cultural affairs. There's an old guy who's in some type of school/program for business who was a bit touchy-feely despite being married. One guy claimed to be 'newly single' after dropping 'every chick on the roster,' while another guy met up with a blind date off of Tinder! I promise, I can't make this stuff up. I ended up staying longer than I intended (I finally did grab a glass of Cab for half price) mainly because I'm nosy.

Tracie N.,"Houston, TX",570,165,487,3.0,5/22/2015,"Ive eaten at this location several times, I work near here and its easy to get to. Ive noticed that on Fridays, they have the music up real high compared to the other days. Not that big of a deal but I have trouble hearing what my coworkers are saying. Not always a bad thing? It's also kind of hard to get in and out in one hour. We're usually late to work if we eat here. The soup and salad is always good. The bread is a tad too toasted for my liking so I usually skip that. The cheddar soup and the chili are my favorite. I always get the wedge salad with that also because I love blue cheese and bacon. Who doesn't love blue cheese and bacon?  The Cobb salad was my favorite thing they served here but they got rid of it! I was bummed when the waiter told me that. Ive tried the Chicken Caesar salad was ok, they were heavy with the dressing. A little too tangy in my opinion. Theyre watermelon and cheese Starter salad. It could have used more of the feta and less onions.  The Asian chicken salad was ok. The portion was a little small though and the chicken was dry. It was loaded with fried wonton, I could have used more greens and less of the fried stuff. The Mediterranean chicken tacos were very good. I was quite impressed with how well they tasted.

Awesome. Points awarded. But that is where they stop. The one thing I was waiting to enjoy was a big disappointment. My Chicken Tortilla soup was missing a key ingredient....chicken.

Karen L.,"Pearland, TX",300,44,32,4.0,10/3/2016,"I've been here multiple times so I thought it was finally time for a review. After recently moving to Pearland, TX from Upstate NY, I've noticed this restaurant is a town staple. I've gotten to try assorted things on the menu- the California pizza, calamari, Brussels sprouts appetizers, jambalaya pasta entree, and a couple of their burgers. The food is average to mediocre. The pasta lacked flavor and I would not get it again. I expected more from the burgers. Both times I ordered it medium and it was quite well done, no pink in it at all. Most recently I got the burger with bacon and BBQ sauce and that lacked flavor despite the bacon. The Brussels sprouts were seasoned well and mostly tasty, but some pieces were charred and unpleasant. The ambience inside is 5/5 for watching sports or having group meals. Lastly, the pizookies are to die for. I've tried almost all of the flavors, ***salted caramel is my favorite. Service is a hit or miss depending on who you get, independent of the time or day you go. Overall, with a 3/5 for average food and 5/5 due to dessert, I give this place a 4/5.

Last night we stopped by after watching The Force Awakens and they were packed but we got in quickly.  +1 point.  I ordered a black and blue and they had no idea what that was.  Come on!  Seriously? They call it Dark side of the moon.  -1 point The kids wanted mozzarella sticks which have been perfect in the past.  Never had any issues before but tonight they were practically cold and crumbly. They were pathetic.  I can get better cheese sticks from Sonic for a heck of a lot cheaper.  -1 point I was craving one of their deep dish pizzas despite the fact that they killed my cheeseburger pizza. It tasted good but came out 5 minutes before everyone else's food.  So I just say there with a pizza in front of me because I want going to eat in front of everyone.  Not cool,  Bjs. -1 for delivery, +1 for taste I will tell you that they have AMAZING beer dinners occasionally where the beer keeps flowing.  I actually have to ask them to stop serving me because I get so toasty. All for $35 and a six course meal.

Their lighter items are marked so you know which ones they are and their number of calories. I've had the Mahi Mahi tacos, which were quite tasty. Is recommend those.  And I also tried the blackened chicken, which was pretty good, but not worth ordering twice. It's off on its balance of heat and flavor. Heat is hot and flavor is overpowered by cumin.

Service staff: our lady server was friendly, only I think she was busy, I think. We were left waiting around for her most of the time. It took 10 minutes between getting the check, another 10 for her to pick it back up, etc.  Atmosphere: it's a brewhouse, much like a TGIF's, you get the loud crowd so it doesn't make much for a close setting unless you're ok with that.

Shawn P.,"Beaverton, OR",209,19,5,5.0,8/26/2015,"My girlfriend and I were visiting the area and stumbled upon BJs restaurant and brewhouse. The last time we ate at a BJs was in Chino, CA and let me tell you... As soon as we saw there was a BJs we went for dinner that night. We love this place. Probably one of our most favorite restaurants! The menu can reach everybody's palates, it's huge. Only downside to that is it takes more time to order because there is so much to choose from. We started off with a couple drinks, they weren't very strong and I admit... I like my drinks a little stronger. Only complaint I have about our dinner. For apps we had spinach stuffed mushrooms and the avocado egg roll. Awesomeness! The avacado egg roll had cream cheese in it and were a little spicy which I loved and the spinach stuffed mushrooms were a good starter size for two people. This was just the beginning. Ordered another round of drinks this time tall ones! My gf had the sirloin with mashed potatoes and asparagus while I had the portobello Swiss burger. One thing is for sure they always nail how to cook a sirloin at this place. Even at the other location in Chino, CA. My burger was amazing!

The food is meh in my opinion, pretty average and sometimes crap; but I'm there for the beer and it makes up for the lack in culinary quality.  Side Story:  I was once offered (did not ask) a to-go water cup for my walk home! It was warm outside and the bartender overheard we were walking, very thoughtful. If you've ever worked in the service industry, you know it's rare to offer to go out of your way to do something that isn't standard or asked of you when it's busy.  Anyhoo, the only time I sat in the restaurant area, the service was bad and our waitress was really rude. There was a problem with our food, her reaction was that of ""bummer"" and walked away.

I had a mini salted caramel pazookie for dessert. The cookie was warm and gooey just like I like them. The taste was nothing exciting. If I return, I'll try another flavor.  The service was not bad. Our order was taken quickly and we did not have to wait long for our food. We had to ask for drink refills twice and our waiter was not the friendliest person, but he did get the job done.

Fun place to watch a game, especially if you wanted to keep up with more than one simultaneous game, as they have a HUGE screen behind the bar split into four sections. Everything at our table was delicious, service was excellent, and the prices seemed reasonable for the amount and quality: Caesar salad - one of best I've had. Snack size pasta and cheese was rich and delicious (and amount more than expected). Parmesan chicken was fantastic (and a generous amount of food). Wedge salad was very good. Tomato soup and broccoli cheddar soup both very tasty. Carnitas/cheese/salsa-covered fries were great. Both varieties of beer were quite satisfying. The cream soda was excellent.

Tanya D.,"Houston, TX",2,26,3,4.0,9/22/2015,"The past few months we've eaten here quite a bit. I was unfamiliar with Bj's until I saw an add for a bogo coupon on another site. I like a deal so I figured, what the heck, I will give them a try. We ended up there for dinner. The staff was very welcoming and friendly and our server was polite and quick. We both ended up getting the baby back rib plates, a 21 dollar meal or so....because, hello, bogo coupon! I was surprised at how good the ribs were. Usually ribs from a non-bbq restaurant are pretty meh. But these were very tasty and tender. Pleasantly surprising. We have been back many times since then and no meal has disappointed yet. The service is always great. Their hot wings are outstanding...crispy and zesty, just how I like them.  The most recent trip we took there, our server, Forest, was great. My guy drinks a lot when and Forest kept those ice teas a'comin'. We ordered I think what was the 5 meat pizza and dang....that was a good pizza! We would have devoured the whole thing if we hadn't been getting a dessert with the Party for 2 deal. We shared a s'mores pazookie.....a baked chocolate cookie topped with peanut butter sauce, roasted marshmallows, and vanilla ice cream. Literally....heaveN in my mouth!

Corey W.,"Pearland, TX",934,168,391,4.0,3/10/2013,"Their Pizza is always good. They now have regular hand tossed crust in addition to their deep dish. I've tried both, but give the edge to the latter as I think it's more satisfying and  I like the atmosphere at this BJ's, no matter how many patrons are there, it never feels crowded and the seating area is far enough spaced apart to where you are not sitting in the next table's lap.  As for the bar, its not my first choice to watch a game as BJ's is more of a family eatery. The screens are only in the bar area and very high up so that you will have to strain your neck to watch, but that's okay, I'll travel to BW3 if I am looking  to drink beers and watch a continuous loop of games with the guys.  Outside of pizza, their dishes can be a hit or a hit or a miss. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT, ORDER THEIR SPAGHETTI!  The turkey burger is above average as are their wings and wraps. The pizzooki is one of my favorite deserts anywhere, others (Champp's and Cheddar's) have unsuccessfully tried to imitate the freshly made cookie topped with ice cream, but to no avail.  Their proprietary beers are usually pretty good,(I prefer the light switch lager) but I'm not sure that they are still brewed in house.  Overall I like BJ's, especially this one.

Instead of the usual spinach, it arrived on a bed of iceberg lettuce. I realize they're both greens, but there is something unappetizing about hot chicken and mashed potatoes on top of lettuce. As soon as I cut into the chicken it felt off. I kept having to check with each bite that it was cooked. It almost seemed to have a skin on it. It didn't taste bad, but quality seemed poor. My fiancé got the grilled chicken club. It kept falling apart, which he attributed to the avocado, and he too made a statement that it seemed that his chicken wasn't  cooked right, almost like it was just boiled.

Dani B.,"Lake Jackson, TX",11,19,18,5.0,8/10/2015,"The owner of the company I work for came down with several investors and our accounting department from California and he asked that I organize a nice luncheon for our company. I called about a week and a half before hand and made reservation and asked if we could sit in a quiet area, specifically the back right side of the restaurant (I had been here several times before and knew this was the most quiet area). When we got to the restaurant they had a huge table with menu's, silverware and water waiting for our whole party. Our waitress was extremely attentive and was running around like she was running a marathon (and she was preggers!!). We ordered a few of the appetizers that had a little bit of everything on it and they came right out and it was all so good, we then turned around and ordered the fried calamari and it came out minutes later and it was fresh as could be! When it came time to order lunch our waitress had the whole menu memorized and was able to answer all questions we had about it. Of course I had to be the most difficult one and asked about the cobb salad that used to be on the menu, she said that they no longer had the turkey or the dressing but said that she could have it ordered if I didn't mind the no turkey or dressing. So I ordered the cobb salad with light ranch and blacked salmon, and OH MY GOSH it's still the best salad ever! Of course you cannot go wrong with ""BJ's freshly brewed root beer"" (St. Arnold's) with any meal. Two of our staff members had their Birthday's recently, the waitress had overheard this and brought them both Pazooki's with candles! Seriously, how sweet is that!??! In all, our luncheon was superb, the staff was so friendly and prompt, the food was delicious, and my team had a great time at a restaurant with such a wonderful atmosphere.

Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370,4.0,12/16/2012,"Wow, the Tai chicken mango salad ( which is new ) was awesome. Gaby was our waitress  and the service was good.  Let's start with a ""healthy"" portion of fried mozzarella sticks, kiddos ( and the big kids too) loved them. Since I started my lunch off on clearly the right foot, I choose to get one of their salads. I went new and I hope it sticks. Great combo of spice with the Tai chicken, and add sweet topical mango to off set the spice, very well done BJs. The greens, not to be left out were just as fresh and crisp. My wife had their Santa Fe salad and she too had a similar experience of greatness. The kids had sliders, which my son enjoyed and my growing teen, she went buffalo boneless wings, her thought was a tad spice for her, but that's her palate. I tried and for spice lovers such as myself, they were just fine. On tap, they have a nice variety of specialty micro brews, I tried this visit their Irish red, I'd give it 4 out of 5, Murphy's Irish red and Killians are still both better brews in my opinion. For beer lovers and kill a gift or two, but $50 Gift card and get a free beer glass, better off buy $100 gift card and get a set of 4 beer glasses.

My husband had a beer.  With about 1/3 left in the glass, the waiter came over and accidentally broke the glass on the table.  He cleaned it up and returned with a very small glass.  We asked ""what's this?"".  He said that since there was 1/3 of a beer in the glass, he was replacing it with the exact same amount.  Since he was very young we explained that common courtesy dictates that he should come back with a full glass of beer and an apology for spilling the beer and breaking a glass. The manager came over and said that he would only replace 1/3 of the beer, because ""We are trying to run a business"".  We explained that he would lose customers with this attitude and he stormed off. I have never heard of serving anyone 1/3 glass of beer.  It's not the missing beer that is the point, it is the rude attitude and customer service.   Needless to say, we will never go back to BJs and their 1/3 beer policy again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=140

Chris H.,"Pearland, TX",36,173,2,3.0,11/23/2011,First off the one thing you don't want to see or smell when you enter or exit a restaurant is the dumspters. They smell horrible and you have to walk past them to get to the door. The only way to avoid this problem is to park across the street at Jared's.  That being said this place is no more than a more expensive Chili's. Menu offerings are about the same just more expensive. I have tried various items on the menu and always end up with the pizza. The cajun pasta is good and spicy but for $15 is a bit pricey. For my entire family to go (wife+3 kids) it is close to $75. This is without alcohol.  Food isn't bad but it just isn't what you expect for the price.

When she suggested BJ's for my aunt's bday dinner- I just went along with it. I looked up their menu online and saw they offered lighter options for their food & drinks.  Went with a party of 7 and I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the grilled tilapia and my mom had the Honey Chicken Salad. The portions are huge- we shared both plates and we had half the salad left over. The fish was delicious served over rice, cooked to a perfect flakiness. The salad was mostly chopped iceberg lettuce so nothing exciting about that.  The high-light of my night was the Skinny Ritas. 130 calories each drink, they add a splash of orange juice and they make them strong. Not strong where you can't enjoy it- but strong enough to make you happy after one drink.  Service was good, she did forget my grandpa's roll & to refill my son's drink but she was nice and I was happy with my drinks so I didn't speak up about it. OH!! I am almost forgetting the 2nd best part- the strawberry beignet dessert. It was gone in 30 seconds flat. The 7 of us inhaled it...it was divine & sinfully good.

The Lettuce wraps were good but not so good that I had to run out and tell someone. What I really enjoyed were the microbrews. They have 8-10 microbrews and we tried every one. I liked the beer better than the food.  Later I was told that the pizza is the best item on the menu and also the only thing anyone should order. Would have been nice to know that earlier.

However they did have a hostess passing around pizza bites and they did get us seated within 10 minutes. It took a LONG time for our server to even come for our drink order; by the time he came we were ready to order our meal (which seemed to fluster our server).  It took 30 minutes for our salads to come - seemed especially slow tonight! Then there are the little things - our menus stayed on the table the whole time, we had to ask for every drink refill EVERY time, and it took 15 minutes of waiting for the condiments to come after our burger was served. The burger and kids pasta were meh - not terrible but wouldn't likely reorder them. That being said, we loved the Pizookies, the pear and walnut salad, and the deep dish pizza. The Hefeweizen beer was especially good! :-). It is a fairly good place for kids - especially older school aged ones. Good portions for them!!

Sherwin S.,"Sugar Land, TX",728,394,42,4.0,12/17/2010,"If you are going to BJ's in the Houston area for food, then chances are you will find something you like. They are obviously known for their ""Chicago"" style pizza's, but the only thing Chicago about them is that they are deep dish. They do not invert their toppings like a traditional Chicago style pizza.  My wife loves their Great White pizza...a variation on the traditional red sauce pizza. This alfredo sauce pizza has good flavor...more than enough to support all that bread!!! I usually like their BBQ Chicken (a classic) or the BJ's favorite (lots of meat). The best thing is...you can do half and half, even though they might tell you they can't with one red sauce and one white sauce.  However, the one thing that sucks about all Houston area BJ's restaurants is their beer. BJ's in California is a traditional brewery...with most of them brewing on site while the others contract out to other BJ's restaurants. In Houston, BJ's contracts out to Saint Arnold's, who in turn only makes their basic year round offerings plus 4 seasonals. I used to love going to the BJ's in California and having my choice of two seasonal beers per restaurant (and every restaurant seemed to have a different two selections) that rotated out frequently. Basically, in any given year, I could try over 30 seasonal selections at BJ's. In Texas, we are limited to four. So yes, Houston being the fourth largest city in America has great housing prices and the cost of living is low...but damnit, I need more beer at BJ's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=160

And the white gravy won me over because I'm usually not a fan of the glue like mystery paste some places try to convince me is white gravy. But the chicken! The chicken! Moist and flavorful with a crispy batter that clings to the meat and doesn't fall off into the potatoes. The pink lemonades were good too very refreshing.

Dani D.,"Frisco, TX",17,115,73,2.0,3/13/2011,"I got an insert for this restaurant in today's Houston Chronicle, so I decided to get a takeout order for dinner. I have never been there before, but it's not far from home and the Ahi Tuna salad looked really good on the insert. I went to the take-section and ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, although it wasn't on the printed menu they still had it in the system. I also ordered the fried artichoke bites and I decided to try the beignet for dessert. The young lady that took my order was SUPERB. She was friendly and helpful and offered me a drink while I wait, so I tried the tropical iced tea. (It comes unsweetened, so be prepared for that) It took nearly 30 minutes for me to get my order, which was shocking because I thought I ordered some simple food (how hard is it to make a salad with rare tuna?) By the time my order came, I had finished my tea and they gave me a refill for the road. I started with the fried artichokes on my way home because I was pretty hungry when I got there. They were lukewarm, which says to me they had probably been sitting while the rest of my meal was prepared and packed, but they were pretty good. The ride home is about 7 minutes door to door.  The ice cream that came with the beignet made the trip just fine and I put it in the freezer while I ate the rest of my food. I finished the artichokes, which was a pretty good sized-portion. The salad was a lot of lettuce and a pretty good portion of sliced tuna with it. The dressing it comes with is a sort of vinaigrette and it's pretty good, but I opted for bleu cheese because I wasn't sure what to expect. I ate about half of my salad and decided to try the beignet. This is where the real disappointment set it. What BJ's called a beignet turned out to be a pretty big dinner roll with cinnamon and sugar baked on top. Think Thanksgiving butter roll. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? $5.95 for a dinner roll?

Ew C.,"Pearland, TX",0,8,,2.0,11/17/2014,"We having been dining at the Pearland location for 5 years  as a couple, with large groups and for business dinners and luncheons. Having said that, we have witnessed a sharp decline in quality of food, service and value of the items one would consider.full dinners. We stopped in after church for what we expected to be the same high quality service and food we have come to expect from BJ's. Sadly, the menu choices have been reduced except for the three ""B""s"" (beer, burgers and bar food). When we ordered the fairly expensive ""special"", we found the food to be overcooked (fish was dried out and steak well done instead of medium rare) and the veggies to be undercooked and nearly raw. The food arrived cold and the waitstaff forgot to bring the special dinner salads. I finally captured our waiter long enough to ask about the salads, and ended up putting them in ""To Go"" boxes.Once we started in on the meal, I found the steak to be overdone, tough, uncuttable and basically inedible. My wife's fish selection was overdone and inedible. I tried the secondary scallop dish and mine tasted very ""fishy"" indicating to me the scallops certainly were not (to put it kindly) not fresh. We complained to the server and finally the manager, who to his credit, gave us 50% off a different selection. At this point, we just chose ""bar food"" flat bread pizza appetizers and unboxed the salads which we found to be sparsely populated  and expensive for what we received. Appetizer pizza was OK, made with some sort of cracker like material, not a made to order crust like they did, at least to my recollection, several years ago. This place is not for the individual looking for a good dining experience. It has become, sadly, a ""sports bar"" catering, again, to to the 3 B's; beer, burgers and bar food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=160

Nate M.,"Seattle, WA",182,159,78,3.0,9/19/2010,"Just thinking about eating here makes me nervous.  Now, I say that not about the quality, price, flavor, or anything like that...it's all about the fact that of the two dozen times I've eaten here, EVERY time I've left so full I felt like I wanted to die and was down 50 bucks.   This place is huge, and is one of the biggest and busiest spots in West Pearland.  It's only a tiny bit less busy than Gringo's, so keep that in mind if you were planning on verbally communicating with anyone in your party and/or are averse to a 45 minute wait.  The menu is ginormous and depending on when you ask me thats either awesome or really frustrating.  On average, I find around 6 items that I'd like and hastily point at one when the wait staff arrives.  The beers are pretty good and served as if it were a true brewhouse, even though there's no actual brewery there (only a problem if you're a brewer yourself and get caught up in semantics).  The tatonka stout is by far the best beer on the menu though its a little odd that its probably the least advertised and the one they consider a ""dessert beer"" (whatever that is) and that it would go great with a giant skillet cookie.  Pastas are pretty good, cheeseburgers are pretty good, never had the pizza but watched my partner do his best to shut one down on many occasions, and the fish and chips are, well....they tried.  Do yourself a favor and skip the later pages in the menu.  But be prepared to coach yourself through eating some of the biggest portions this side of Texas and pay for it the whole rest of the evening. Have you ever wondered how you miraculously racked up a 50 dollar bill with a couple of cheeseburgers and beers?  Well, get ready for de ja vu.  I'm not sure if my mental math is bad or if there's some bermuda triangle style arithmetic bend inside of here but almost every time I go I think my bill is going to be 30 ish and it ends up way more.  Maybe I should skip the 7 dollar beer next time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=180

First thing I order here when we wait for a table is a glass a wine, and their specialty brew (which fiance LOVES!!) I forget the name.... something with the word RED in it.. who cares....  Well, when I go there, I always order the same thing, all the time. It's not even real food, but i get the calamari extra crispy, and it's ok. I dont really know why I always order it. Nothing that stands out from all the other restaurants. I think I order it bc I always feel pressured to order something.. anything... And then their string fries!! I LOVE string fries!!! They also put parmesan garlic on it, but for some reason, they always forget to put it on my order, so I always end up receiving the regular fries. and they're still good. Im just too nice i guess. I should complain next time.  Fiance has tried their Chicken Parmesan with a white wine sauce (???)  a few times, and that's our favo dish there!!! It's amazing everytime.

Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,3.0,2/26/2012,"I would have given it a solid 4 stars but the host staff was horrible. We arrived around 8:00 on a Friday night and was told the wait for 2 would be 15 min. Which surprised us because it was packed. So we decided to wait (initially we went to gringos and the wait was close to 2 hrs). After 15 min had passed my sister asked how much longer should we expect to wait and was told another 15 min. And we were ok with that because that's what we figured in the first place. 20 minutes later we walked over to the bar and asked a server if it was open seating, she said it was and we grabbed a table someone was just getting up from. It was almost 20 min after that when our buzzer finally let us know our table was ready. By that time we had drinks and our appetizers. There was no apology from the host staff about the 15 min wait that turned into over an hour even when it was mentioned. The host looked at me like she had no idea what I was saying.  Now on to the food and service. Our server was ally or abby (can't remember) She was really nice and helpful. Sister had the bruschetta and I had the snack size mac n cheese and garlic bread. It was amazing! The bread was perfectly cooked and she loved her bruschetta. And the mac but not so good the next day. We also each ordered pizzas (1/2 price during happy hour!!)  And though we weren't able to finish them (SO FULL) we did enjoy them and they warmed up nicely the next day in the oven! I'm willing to go back next time I visit. Probably not during such a busy time as their hostess staff clearly has no clue how to guesstimate wait times. There is quite a difference in 15 min vs over an hour!

To be fair, one of my experiences was take out and take out experiences tend to always be a little different.  Let's begin with my dine in experience. The restaurant is beautiful. The decor is fresh and modern, which of course makes for a nice dining experience. After we were seated, our waiter appears with a half hearted smile. It wasnt that he was rude or anything, he was just  shy as a baby kitten. He had no small talk skills...he was more of a hello, how may I help you kinda guy....this kind of waiter is best suited for a fast food joint; in my opinion. The Food: The menu is massive. There is a little bit of everything offered at this joint. The menu reminded me of the menus of Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory. For a foodie like me, having a million choices is a good thing, because I always want to try one of each (LOL) however, my dining companion and I decided on the ""Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo"" that has all of their most popular appetizers. This was WONDERFUL! By the time we finished it, we were nearly stuffed, but being the troopers that we are, we ordered entrees. My dining companion ordered ""Dereks Meatloaf Sandwich"" which she said was good, but couldnt eat but 3 bites...I ordered the basic BJ Burger which was just a burger-nothing really to write home about. I took a few bites and we both took the remainder to go. I finished my burger a day later and it was decent....the same goes for the meatloaf sandwhich (according to my dining companion). Good experience...yay! About 3 weeks later, I decide that I want more of BJ's because my first experience was so good. So I call in and order their Chicken Fried Steak along with the cheddar mashed potatoes and fresh veggies. Go in to pick it up...the cashier was nice and very cordial. Get the food home, plop down in front of the tv with my trusty tv tray and begin to eat....to my disappointment, the chicken fried steak was more than disgusting! It was dry; as if it had been cooked for too long...the meat nor the batter had any flavor whatsoever. Who screws up chicken fried steak anyway? I coulda went to Ihop and got a better tasting CFS!  Needless to say, this take out experience was the pitts. Either they have no clue what chicken fried steak is supposed to taste like or they just didnt care that they screwed it up...either way, it was a big disappointment. I give BJ's 2 stars because they halfway got it right...1 of the 2 stars is for my good first experience. The other star is for effort. Should I give them another chance?

jason j.,"Pearland, TX",2,77,10,1.0,11/24/2009,"bad service, overpriced, and the food was not that good when we got it.   i have heard lots of good things about bj's so took my parents there after a football game. the places was not crowded maybe 20% occupancy, but it took forever to get seated, then longer for our order to get taken. then when the food came out it was wrong. i father had ordered a chicken salad. it came out with no chicken and when my dad asked were the meat was he was informed ""wrongly"" that the salad had no chicken. my wife ordered a small pizza and never got it the entire time we were there even after asking for it several times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pearland-3?start=200
