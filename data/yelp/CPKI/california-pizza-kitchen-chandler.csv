Christopher K.,"Gilbert, AZ",94,139,68,3.0,5/8/2016,"I actually would give this place a 3.4 out of 5 stars. I recently tried the food here & used the curbside service.  The pizza was decent but kind of pricey for the size.  If I go back, I will make sure I get extra sauce on my pizza.  The customer service was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20
Damian B.,"Tempe, AZ",60,14,32,4.0,5/12/2016,"To start off, I used to despise this place! Hated it with a passion but that was years back. My wife finally convinced me to try it again and seriously I was surprised with how much this place has changed their ways of cooking pizza. Idk if it was just that one I went to prior to this visit, but I honestly will not mind going back and eating here again. The pizza I had was the TITS! I can't remember exactly what I ordered but I do have a photo of it. I know it was split in half so I could get two different flavor a out of one pizza. I will have to try it again and pray that it stays consistent with the taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20
Jacob F.,"Chandler, AZ",89,22,4,2.0,1/8/2017,"We were quickly sat at a dirty table.  The ice tea was exceptionally bitter.  The spinach artichoke dip was good, not great  and rather expensive.  The Caesar salad was good but, as an odd complaint, the forks are not designed for salads; it took constant stabbing at the salad to pick up a piece of lettuce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20
Rashmi G.,"Chandler, AZ",551,418,906,1.0,9/11/2014,"One star for this restaurant for the delicious Tequila Fettucine ... No additional stars for anything else. We decided to stop by CPK because I had a gift card and also had pretty high expectations because I've dined at other CPK locations. We were seated promptly when we walked inside and it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress came by to introduce herself & from that moment, we were pretty put off by her attitude but kept an open mind. The service we received from her did not improve .. in fact, it just got worse. CPK has a pretty extensive menu so it was taking us a few minutes to decide what we wanted to get. It wasn't as though we were holding up other customers from being seated while taking our time, since, as I mentioned before, it was not busy at all - only a few of the tables had patrons the whole time we were there. We had to wait for a while for her to return to ask if we wanted anything else and she was very frazzled the whole time, running back and forth. From what we could see, she was only waiting 2 tables. Anyways, so long story short, we were very displeased on that front. Moving on to the food. We ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine (substituted chicken for shrimp) and the Garlic Fettuccine with chicken and mushrooms. Both were good. The Garlic Fettuccine was lacking any flavor other than garlic but the chicken & mushrooms tasted good in it. We enjoyed both of those dishes so we thought we'd order some dessert. We decided to try some Beligian Chocolate Souffle Cake. It came out pretty quickly but we were horribly disappointed as it was served to us on a dirty plate. There were little food particles that had clearly dried up on it ... something that shouldn't have made it to our table. Considering that they were pretty obvious to us & we flagged down the manager right away to show him, it should've been pretty obvious to the person who put it on the plate as well. The manager asked us if we'd like another one or something else instead but at that point, we were done. It made us second guess the quality control of things that are being served at this restaurant, so I'm not sure we'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20
Alex D.,"The Islands, Gilbert, AZ",133,181,123,3.0,8/15/2015,"So far so good..   Came here for the first time the other day during a lunch break. Wasn't busy at all so figured why not.  They actually have a pretty decent lunch menu and prices.  I ordered the 7"" pizza combo with a side salad ($9.95). Not bad. This was more then enough food to hold me over for the day. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and Caesar salad.  The pizza wasn't bad. A little doughy for my preference but still good flavor. And the Cesar was good. Nothing fancy just your typical Cesar salad.  The service was great, friendly, and attentive.   Also on the plus side.. This is the only restaurant at the mall that will validate your valet parking if you choose valet.    I wouldn't mind coming back another time and maybe trying a soup and sandwich combo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20
David M.,"Chandler, AZ",32,3,,1.0,9/15/2016,"Mind you I'm only giving CPK a one-star because there's not an option to give them zero. I had the displeasure of meeting Doug the manager at the Chandler CPK location for the first time the other day. I am certain it will be the last as he was one of the least friendly, condescending, and quite frankly confrontational managers of any establishment I've ever come in contact with. He was rude , impolite, and didn't care one bit about my future business or the voice that I have as a consumer. The only thing Doug cared about on that day was being a bully. There is no food no matter the price, taste, or convenience that is worth this experience. I had also tried to call CPK corporate at the 1-800 we care number on the receipt. Apparently they don't really care,  seeing as how I have yet to hear back from them. At least I still have this voice... thank you Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20
Regina C.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,51,10,3.0,7/30/2016,"Okay so I like California Pizza Kitchen. I love their mango cooler drink (I'm pregnant and crave it-they make it with ginger ale for me due to a citrus allergy). I like that you can order smaller portions. The food is always consistent and the service good. If I have to eat at a chain I like this restaurant.  Here's the thing though-My husband and I ate at this location approximately 3 weeks ago and what happened is still bugging me so I need to write a review. We were about 3/4 into our meal and I was watching the kitchen. I enjoy watching the kitchen, being a former server you see things other's miss. So here goes, I see a food runner pick up a pizza. She's older mid 40's probably with short grey hair and black glasses. As she is walking she looks at the pizza and picks something off of the pizza. I see a cheese string stretch from the item to its origins on the pizza (I did not know what it was I assumed it was paper or something). She takes a couple of steps and puts the item IN HER MOUTH. At this point I cannot see the woman's mouth but assume she swallowed it, I am watching her back like a hawk. She drops the pizza in front of a man on the other side of the restaurant. After a couple of sentences exchanged between the two I see her head toward us and i'm just staring at her slack jawed. She headed back into the kitchen and I see her grab a napkin and wipe the cheese grease off her offending food stealing hand.  My husband looks at me concerned, he obviously believed I was going into early labor or something. I informed him of what happened and he just looked disgusted. We sign our check and leave. I WAS TRAUMATIZED, I had no idea what to do. I thought I had hallucinated.  But I had NOT hallucinated this actually happened and I probably will not eat here again. A+ for the mango cooler though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20
Dawn B.,"Mesa, AZ",165,64,136,3.0,6/11/2015,"The service is really good, however it seems to take ages to get beverages. I ordered our beverages and apps at the same time and the apps came first.  The dumplings are good. I don't recommend shrimp in the lettuce wraps.

Nicole C.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,1,5.0,1/19/2017,"I've never written a Yelp review before but my experience today warranted one. The service at California Pizza Kitchen is some of the best I've ever experienced at a restaurant. The host, my server, and the manager were all very nice and friendly. The host asked if I had ever been in before, which I said I had not. About 10 minutes later after I had ordered the manager came over to introduce himself and welcome me in and brought me a free plate of chips and guacamole! Who does that for a first time visit?! My server Travis always kept my drink fresh without me having to ask and was funny and nice. Even the chef who brought out my food and grated fresh cheese on my pizza was nice! Amazing service here.

David S.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,186,45,3.0,5/10/2015,"All things considered, this is a pretty nice joint. It's at the mall, which makes it more convenient, but also less classy, so if you're choosing between this location and the Scottsdale location, go to Scottsdale (I believe their oven is even coal-fired), but if you're in the area and looking for pizza, this location does fit the bill. The manager opened the door for us on the way in, and checked on us during the meal, which is awesome.  The staff was all super friendly, and service was fast. What this location lacks is any kind of personality. It's clean and bright, but doesn't leave you wanting to hang out, and nothing in the dining room is unique enough to leave a lasting impression, which I guess it what it comes down to. Stop in for a bite to eat and this will fit the bill, but if you're looking for something memorable... well... you're probably gonna have to leave the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=20

We were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space,we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min. Although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.            Now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  ""They must think I'm  wonder woman, I already have a table of 7 and a table of 12"".

Amy S.,"Gilbert, AZ",210,214,47,1.0,6/13/2013,"Went to this location for lunch last month (May 2013) and the service sucked... like beyond sucked. I had to wait at the door to be greeted... then was taken to a table. I literally sat there for 10 minutes before ANYONE came to the table to greet me or ask if I would like a beverage. And, to top it off, it was the hostess who came over because she noticed that no one had come over to me yet.  She got my iced tea, and I saw her to over to a group of 3 waiters/waitresses who were standing in a group talking (I assume to tell someone that I was waiting). It took another 5 minutes before anyone came over. We were picking up our purses to leave when the waiter finally came over. He never apologized for the wait.  I can't complain about the food. I got a sandwich and it was good... but the food at CPK is not my issue.

Nicole S.,"Gilbert, AZ",89,122,253,2.0,5/1/2017,"First I'll start off with the terrible service. We were initially being helped by a lady server but she had to switch with the super tall, dark gentleman that was working the bar area. He was so busy doing other things (getting people drinks, working the register, talking to people at the bar) that our lunch turned into an almost 2 hour lunch. We never got refills on water until I had to flag him down and then he filled up 2 of the 4 empty water cups and walked away. He then said he was going to bring us bread and disappeared for like 20 minutes. We ordered 4 pasta dishes and the cook put the plates out for our server to bring to our table and we literally sat there for a really long time watching our food get cold while our server was by the bar talking to other customers and doing other things behind the bar. When we got our food, he never came around to ask how things were and when we needed our check and some boxes, he was nowhere to be found. The worst part of all, when we did pay and he processed the credit card and came back, he did this martial arts bow to us like we were supposed to be impressed by that and thanked us for coming in. My family is Asian so that's pretty inappropriate to do and I didn't see him bowing to his other white customers. Really ignorant, but what can you do? The food was ok, we ordered the pesto penne pasta, the jambalaya pasta, the kung pao speghetti, and the garlic fetticcini alfredo. The pesto penne tasted ok but the pasta wasn't cooked and was still hard. It wasn't even al dente, it was still uncooked and that made the dish hard to eat. The jambalaya pasta was good, seasoned well and had good flavor. The garlic alfredo was also good but was a tad on the salty side. The kung pao speghetti was pretty good for a pizza restaurant. It was super spicy and saucy.  Overall, I probably wouldn't come back unless I had to. There's plenty of other restaurants that are fast, make good quality food, and have servers that don't waste your time or do stupid things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler

Melanie E.,"Phoenix, AZ",76,65,28,3.0,6/19/2017,"I probably had the strangest experience here. I went on a Friday afternoon about 1PM with a group of 6. Our food was good, but the service was nothing to brag about.  For starters, the ice in our glasses was 3/4 of the way full so we constantly needed refills. At one point, we had put one of the empty glasses near the front of the table for the waitress to grab and hopefully refill, and she actually said, ""let's save the ice"" while pouring that ice into someone else's glass nearby!! She proceeded to refill the glass with the 'saved' ice.   When we were about done eating we noticed another group about our size sat down on the other side of the booth and left before receiving any service. Since there were 3 middle school aged boys with us, we asked if those people stated that we were the cause or something else (the people didn't seem to be there for long). The waitress told us a server called out an hour before her shift and then asked us to tell the manager, Doug, that the group of people were not there long (on at least 3 separate occasions!!) so they wouldn't get chewed out later.  Very unprofessional service.  ***On 6/20/17, Doug, the general manager, contacted me and was very apologetic about the whole situation. He expressed concern regarding the ice situation and how it's a non negotiable for any server to do that. He offered to make it up to us.  Doug was very professional and informed me that he would talk with the staff members about it. I feel confident that something like that would not happen again.***",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler

Nick P.,"Tempe, AZ",0,2,,3.0,4/15/2017,"I went here for dinner before a movie with some friends and the service was quite honestly the worst I've had in a long time. We ordered drinks and apps. The apps came out pretty quick and were descent, so quick in fact that our apps came out before our drinks. We had to have waited at least 15 minutes to get our drinks delivered because it appeared that the waiter had to mix the drinks himself. Speaking of which $11 for a cocktail in chandler seams a little much. The food wait time was pretty long as well probably about an hour wait, so long that we almost left. Worst of all, between getting our drinks and getting our food, probably 30-40 minutes, our waiter never visited our table. In fact we saw him visiting another table repeatedly without once coming to ours. Within this time I decided to grab the server's craft of water to fill our glasses for the first time. Then ten minutes later I grabbed it again but it was empty so I grabbed the tea craft because I was sick of waiting and very thirsty. This occurred one more time ten minutes later at which point our server finally came to check on us and said jokingly as I poured our glasses full of tea, tea that we didn't order or pay for, that he was sorry for the wait and that he wouldn't add the tea to our bill. I thought yeah no kidding you don't mention the tea and I won't mention the terrible service.  I've been a server so I know the struggles and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but not checking on a table for 30-40 minutes is REALLY bad. Although he was super jovial and personable when he was around.

Qui W.,"Chandler, AZ",32,54,67,3.0,6/30/2017,The Caesar salad is something fresh and wonderful. I loved it. The grilled shrimp was an awesome pairing as was the SANGRIA FLIGHT drinks. The only reason why this establishment isn't getting 5-stars is because we've dined-in the restaurant 3 times over the last 2 weeks and the service is consistently slow after being seated. 10-mins after being seated the waiter usually stops by and asks for your drink order. I've been able to place my food order and drink order at once during that time because I had already spent 10-mins reading the menu.

The last two chain pizzerias I had been to were awful so I was very wary about eating here. I was really impressed with the pizza I ordered the thin crusted ""Sicilian"" with capicola ham, salami, sausage, and topped with fresh basil. It was the best pizza I had eaten in a long time and the person accompanying me had chosen a very good pie too. They had a Hawaiian style barbeque chicken pizza that I though was awesome even though that is not something I would typically order. The service was good. It was kind of cold in the sense that it wasn't personal or very friendly, yet it was very fast and efficient. The pizza was good, but I can't imagine ordering anything other than that off the menu.

Kim B.,"Chandler, AZ",22,70,3,1.0,6/10/2011,"This location needs to improve their service big time. I hardly ever eat here and only ate here to use up some free meal coupons they gave me since my one visit here was dismal and wound up in a comped bill and they also sent me free meal coupons. Without these free meals I would NEVER come back here. I'll refrain from going into too much detail on my one disasterous visit but this place was a complete joke that day even though they were slow and it took them 45 minutes to bring out our order which were salads....and an inatttentive waitress who was avoiding our table because she knew we were pissed, did not help. So I complained to corporate and got sent my free meals.  First visit we used 2 of the free meal coupons. Service was good, from a young man. Food is good, not great, my husband has had better pasts dishes elsewhere but it was good.  A week later we came back to use up the second batch of our free meal coupons and we ordered the artichoke/spinach dip as an appetizer. That took 20 minutes to get out to us and it was only luke warm. I asked the waiter what took so long and why was it not hot and he admitted to us he forgot to put the order in and had to rush it. Nice. So there is obvious a service issue here. The rest of the meal was ok..I love the BBQ chicken pizza. Otherwise there is no reason to eat here. Crappy service, just ok food. I must be bad luck...2 out of the last 3 visits we had service issues so probably best I just stay clear of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=60

Nicolette K.,"Mesa, AZ",17,18,,2.0,6/30/2010,"I don't particularly like chain restaurants, but when getting a relatively large family together, sometimes a chain is the only way to go.  California Pizza Kitchen is a frequent choice for our family, as we all have various dietary restrictions that this restaurant can easily accommodate. The gem (and the drawback) of this place is consistency.  The food is consistently good (not great, but not mediocre).  The service is consistently bad, mediocre on a good day. Our most recent trip resulted in a dinner mistake that both the server and the manager defended, though it was clear that a mistake had been made.  This is not the first time that I've been on the receiving end of that type of conversation, and it makes me wonder just what makes the staff here so condescending to the needs and requests of customers. My aunt ordered a pizza Margherita, but asked for sliced tomatoes on top in lieu of the sauce.  If the staff spoke the lingo of New York-style pizza restaurants, she would have ordered a white pizza with sliced tomatoes.  Regardless, she was incredibly clear with the waitress what she wanted, and her order was repeated back verbatim.  The five of us at the table all believed that everyone was on the same page. However, when the food actually came out, it was clear that our server was not on the same page as our family.  She explained that, upon placing the order for the pizza, that the tomatoes normally on the pizza (a diced variety, supposedly part of a ""chunky sauce"") WERE the sauce, so she had the kitchen go ahead and make the pizza without tomatoes.  ""Was that okay?"" she asked, apparently suddenly unsure of her decision as she was just now bringing everyone our food. First, the decision was contrary to what my aunt had asked for.  She asked for tomatoes, but no sauce.  While the kitchen may put diced tomatoes on this particular pizza, I have ordered varieties of pizza at that very restaurant before with sliced tomatoes (the requested substitution).  I'm not sure why sliced tomatoes were impossible, but they were.  Furthermore, it is up to the server to communicate about substitutions with the kitchen.  It seems that, had she done a bit more probing, she could have had the right pizza brought out the first time. Second, if the kitchen is somehow completely unable to make that kind of pizza, she should check with the table BEFORE putting the order through.  Her decision to just wait until the order was out left my aunt waiting an additional twenty minutes for another pizza to be made.  Our experience would have been totally different if she had spent 45 seconds checking back in with us to communicate about what our options really were. When the manager was brought over, he asserted the server's story that the tomatoes are part of the sauce, and because my aunt asked for ""tomatoes but no sauce,"" the kitchen went ahead and made the pizza without the sauce.  Only after a few minutes of discussion did he offer to have the pizza re-made with diced tomatoes. While they attempted to rectify it by comping the pizza, the damage had been done; our experience had been ruined by our server's decision to not confirm her understanding of my aunt's request. I wouldn't rate this a two-star restaurant if I hadn't had SEVERAL similar experiences here.  It must be the management, as other CPKs that I've visited throughout the valley are quite good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=60
Nicole E.,"Tempe, AZ",43,2,,1.0,7/25/2015,"I had dinner here tonight with my friend and we sat in a booth. After the food came out, we were talking and had a few bites and I saw a cockroach climbing up the wall of her booth. I told my friend, who responded by turning to look at it and backing away. We called over the nearest waiter-we were sitting next to the cash register- and when she came over we told her and pointed to the roach. She looked at it and said oh well they bombed Wednesday, and walked away. Then when our waitress came by and asked how we were doing, I told her they had a bug problem, and she said well all the restaurants here do, the bugs come inside when it's hot. She then walked away also. My friend was paranoid and didn't want the roach to climb on her or near the food, and  she lost her appetite and stopped eating for the rest of the time there.

But when I want something a tad different, this place will suffice.  This location has consistently treated us with great service. My issue with CPK (in general) is that you pay quite a bit for what amounts to a pie that is only slightly larger than a personal size pie. We also tried the small cravings Mediterranean plate and seriously that is a joke of a serving, again overpriced.

Chrystal C.,"Chandler, AZ",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2015,"So disappointed. This was my second time dining here and though the first time the service was okay, today's experience was just crappy. I, along with my brother ordered a Pepperoni pizza and the Baja chicken. Kept it simple. After waiting for about a half hour for our food + (no concern nor a check in from our waitress) I approached her and asked if she could check on our order. She explained that they were short on cooks in the kitchen (which I understand, things happen). She explained that she would go and check in. After that she never returned, no update on our food nor a refill for our drinks. After about 50 minutes of waiting, a man who I'm assuming was the manager came up to us and said that he was sorry about the wait and that our dinner would be paid for. Our food did not come out for another 10 minutes, we waited about a total of one hour for a small sized pepperoni pizza and an appetizer on a Monday afternoon. I work as a waitress at a breakfast café, so I understand that these things are bound to happen, but that does not excuse the poor service I received today. It was only correct that our food was paid for. I did not enjoy myself, I did not feel like we were taken serious as customers and the food unfortunately did not make up for it.

The rest of the crew is wonderful too, I just havent had the pleasure of seeing anyone else more than once (so I dont remember any names!) I love how they always inform you about any specials, as well as their personal favorites. They have a full bar & their bloody mary is spicy & well worth the money.

Danielle T.,"Gilbert, AZ",16,104,11,1.0,8/24/2011,"California Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down.  Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK.  Recently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing.  The pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours.  So we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=80

We wanted a lighter dinner. So he had the bbq chicken salad with no dressing (just BBQ sauce). His was decent, but for 10$ (for the half salad!) was unsatisfactory. It was kind of small and had very little chicken, tomatoes, and corn. It would be nice if the chicken on the salad was hot.... it was not awesome, but not terrible. I got the half peach salad....it was alright, but had possibly a whole red onion in it..... it was super oniony to the point where at the end of the salad I had more onion left than I had eaten (with onion in almost every bite). A bit overwhelming, but the rest of the salad was fine. It had some cranberries and nuts, but could have had more of that, less onion. We also split the chicken quesadilla small plate, which was decent, tasted like their baja tortilla spring roll. I just felt for two half salads and 4 small pieces of quesadilla 24$ was a bit steep.

David H.,"Chandler, AZ",147,43,,5.0,6/9/2013,"If you haven't been to CPK lately, then you are missing out!  They have revamped almost every aspect of their menu, while keeping the favorites intact!  Everything from their silverware to serving plates, to glassware has been upgraded.  And while the service has always been great, they have stepped it up a notch!  There are too many new things to try to mention here, but my personal favorite is the Cedar Plank Salmon with Corn Succotash.  Their pizzas have always been great, but they have found a way to improve them.  For example;  the Hawaiian pizza now comes with giant slices of pineapple instead of small chunks.  And the kids favorite Mac & Cheese is still as good as ever.......I always sneak a few bites off their plates!  The Avocado Spring Rolls are a meal in themselves, as are several of the other recent additions to the appetizer menu.  CPK is definitely on top of our list of family favorites.  And I am not sure how ling this is going to last......but they are validating parking at the Chandler Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=80

Lisa N.,"Chandler, AZ",38,69,6,3.0,7/11/2010,"Went today. One of my fav chains I know I can count on. Today my BBQ Chicken Pizza was of course, delish as always. And their ceasar salad is always good too. I must tell you that they have a new honey wheat crust, DO NOT GET IT! I didnt know it was new and when my pizza came I kept biting down on something ""hard"". So when our Awesome waitress came by to see how our food was, I questioned if it was the ""honey wheat crust, bc my pizza didnt taste like ""normal"", she said yes but we did get a new honey crust that people are not liking :) She offered to replace my pizza and I said no thats ok. Which is out of the norm for me, she pretty much twisted my arm into having it replaced and Im glad I did. So I left once again, very pleased. Also, I would go here for curbside somewhat regularly but I have decided its a bit pricey for carry out, so its no longer on my carry out list.  ** One last note, The last few times, prior to this visit when we walked in smelled of ""rotten eggs"", maybe a sewer issue? And we refused to stay. We are pleased to announce the smell wasnt there and we can finally go as often as we like. Thumbs up to CPK!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=80
Tom A.,"Conway, AR",101,144,62,4.0,5/8/2010,I'm a big fan of the Chicken Pesto Pizza and chicken lettuce wraps! Can be a little pricey with drinks but overall good and consistent for chain restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=80
B D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,108,,3.0,12/1/2008,This is a solid place to go for lunch.  They have good lunch-sized salads that fill you up and the wait staff is pretty good if you let them know that you have only an hour for lunch.  My faves are any of the salads or the Sicilian style pizzas.  The regular crust ones are just a tad bit oily for me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=80
Natalie W.,"Chandler, AZ",54,263,,4.0,3/22/2007,"Yeah, I know it's a chain, but it's a good chain. Really dig their Thai chicken pizza, and the appetizers arre above average. It may be overdone but I can't help liking the place. It's also a good go-to choice when you can't all agree on what you want to eat. At CPK there's always a pizza to suit everyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=80
Evan B.,"Tempe, AZ",262,546,1811,3.0,3/3/2011,"Who thinks of California for pizza?  And who goes to a pizza kitchen for pasta?  Well I did. Judging by the 4 or 5 other tables not many others seemed to think this way. Fyi the near by oregano's had a 1hr wait at the same time. It was a Sunday night so that means it was time for a our family trip for chain Italian food.  We started the meal with a pizza as an app, The wild mushroom pizza $12.99. A bit steep for an app, but their app selection is quite limited. The pizza seemed a bit soggy by time it arrived with our meals, the mushrooms were good, but the cheese had congealed.. For my main I stayed on the mushroom kick and got the mushroom ravioli with red sauce an vein attempt to be healthy. $11.99. It was good enough with copious amounts of Parmesan cheese and red pepper. nothing special. The bread that came with our meal was cold and a bit stale, like the business this place seems to be getting. Overall nothing special and not a good value, but no wait and that matters when you are hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=40
Betty C.,"Hillsboro, OR",39,274,71,3.0,4/27/2013,"This mall is BUSY so if you hate being crowded by people or standing in lines, then you are in the wrong place.  However, the people at this location are very well trained.  Service is most excellent, in fact, pretty amazing. The food is CPK, so if you have been there, it is what to expect.  The pizza dough has an odd taste, I hardly ever have their pizzas due to that, but we did last night, and it was okay.  The appetizer salad with asparagus is A M A Z I N G, simple but delightful.  The pasta (I had alfredo) was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=40

Cameron S.,"Phoenix, AZ",122,15,7,1.0,9/5/2015,"Came here for dinner tonight and we were seated promptly by the hostess near the window near other guests that were dining. We sat at our table approximately 10-12 min without acknowledgement. There was a server, I believe her name was Gina, was serving a table directly in front of us and never once made eye contact with us or asked if we had been helped yet. I did not see any manager walking the floor to address this issue with so we just got up and left. They were not even busy at the time so there was no excuse for this level of service.

D C.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,45,104,3.0,2/14/2014,"Larry & Rick where are you? We've been loyal CPK fans for years, since their early beginnings in California, and until the last year or so eating there at least 4 or 5 times a month. Over the years we've seen many changes but whenever the original founders were at the helm you could always count on fantastic food and service. Unfortunately Larry and Rick are no longer involved and it shows. Traditional favorites that established their fame, like Thai chicken pizza and chicken tequila fettuccine,  have been changed, and the service no longer has that CPK panache. We hoped the new corporate management would finally get it, but they seem to think they know better than two of the most successful restauranteurs in history. Too bad for the rest of us because it's an error in judgement. So now we only go to CPK for the key lime pie... until they decide to change that too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=40

Keola W.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",0,4,3,2.0,1/31/2015,"This is kind of a tough review.  YELP should allow us to breakdown experience by section ie; staff, management, food and establishment.  I had excellent service from our eventual waiter.  Patrick he was awesome !!!  However, he only became our waiter when the waitress did not want to serve us.  The original reason given to us was that she (Kendall) was to busy at the moment.  I found this hard to believe since the section was not very full, but accepted it and paid it no mind.  But then I watched as a party of 6 a party of 2 and a party of 4 all got sat within 5 mins of us.  We were now the ONLY table in the section not being taken care of by Kendall.  She continuously stared at our table and never offered any assistance or a water refill. Typically, you will find me in a suit and tie or business casual attire, this day however I was in my workout clothes and firmly believe my less then stellar appearance at the moment made the server hesitant to be my waitress !!!  Nonetheless, Patrick was great and the food was good.  Management should train their employees not to prejudge customers, Patrick received a great compensation for his ability to help us from a section across the room, and non-judgmental demeanor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=40

If I ate the soup, the entree would be cold so I had to send back the soup.  Food was ok but, without the soup, I left kinda hungry.  Of course, this was strictly the waitress's fault, but not sure if I would go there again with so many great restaurants in Chandler.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chandler?start=40
Mario C.,"Tempe, AZ",167,403,,3.0,3/22/2013,"Why only 3 stars??? Well it was the service and not the food. We have been here before and had really good food and really good service.  Not last night.  We came here for dinner,I was very tired after a long day of work. I just wanted Ice Tea. No alcohol,which I very rarely drink anyway. T went to wash her hands and asked me to order her a hot water with lemon. When our server Sareena came over and I gave her the drink order, she seemed miffed we did not want alcohol. She kept saying ,""you don't want any Cocktails??? When did CPK become the boozing place, Anyway, she brought out the Ice tea and hot water, however, no lemon and she was holding the glass from the top. It is a glass coffee mug ,it has a handle. Why are you putting your fingers all over the tops of the cups.???  T had to go to get lemon and napkins. She never asked her if she wanted more Hot water,but she did refill my Ice Tea. We ordered the Chicken Waldorf Salad. Which was great ,but she never asked us what type of dressing we wanted. It has 2 choices.  Plus she never brought us bread, we had to ask for it. I got the Fish Tacos and they were quite good made with Mahi. T got the Kung Pao Pasta, with Shrimp. I sampled that as well and it was awesome. However, Sareena never picked up any dishes from our table or trash. The manager did a drive by and she cleaned up the table for us. Even the table behind us,yelled out to her, hey can we get some bread! I do not agree with that, but clearly she did not know the proceedure. When T asked for more hot water,as she was not offered any.  Our server once again brought out the cup by the top and when she put it down she actually ran her fingers over the lip one more time for good measure. IT HAS A HANDLE,WHY ARE YOU FINGERING THE CUPS!  Of course T was freaked out,because she is such a germ aphobe anyway. But even I do not understand why you would serve a glass or cup like that.

Roxane S.,"Plainfield, IL",0,4,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Took our grandchildren here after seeing a movie. On the way back from taking my granddaughter to the bathroom I spot a women who is holding her dog and taking food off of her plate putting it on the table and letting the dog eat it. Now I am assuming this is an alleged ""service dog"" which I believe are supposed to be crated. I mention this to the host who said her hands are tied nothing she can say or do. They were aware of it and said other dinners were complaining but you know have to be PC! Asked to speak to the manager so the shift supervisor said he was not aware of it but was totally in agreement should be crated. Came back several times to make sure we were still ""enjoying"" our meal. Why yes I was and silently praying I was not at a dog table. I am sure that table was not cleaned properly after the offending dog left. My husband than took our grandson to the bathroom and apparently doggie was still not done with his dinner as he was still eating off the table. Well so much for shift manager Travis sending in the big guns to talk to her as he reported back to us he had done. I am sorry if you need a service dog eat outside or keep it crated. Needless to say will never go there again , will shout it from the rooftops and also notified the county health department. This service dog thing is out of control!
