3,Joshlyn W.,"Nacogdoches, TX",13,38,9.0,5.0,2012-05-11,"I've never really had a bad experience at this Chili's. I remember once they accidentally paged our thingy thinking it was this huge party's pager, and so they sat us, then realized it wasn't right, so we accidentally got sat earlier than we should, it was pretty awesome, they didn't make us go back and wait, they just cleaned a dirty table and sat us there instead of sending us back.  I have lap band(weight loss surgery) and I often hardly touch my food, and several times I've been asked by a very concerned server if my food was okay, they genuinely cared if something was wrong w/ my food, which my food was fine, my lap band was just in a mood. Not sure if anyone else remembers the 2 for $35 coupon they emailed out, but I used two of them back when they sent them out on two different occasions and I couldn't make it to my dessert, and the first time I was just going to miss out, and the sweet waiter offered to get it to go for me, so the second time when I couldn't make it to dessert I asked to get it to go as well, and they did. They understood and didn't want me to not get what I paid for.  I just wish the atmosphere was a little more quiet, but what can you really expect from a family restaurant.  Oh and I am a member w/ the email club, and I really like how they send out coupons for kids to eat free, and that they offer healthier options for kids, and well adults too, I don't have kids, but I have friends w/ kids, so I care about that too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches?start=20,2.484,2.484,2.484,2.484,2.484
2,Dustin H.,"Nacogdoches, TX",6,2,,5.0,2013-10-27,"I don't know why this particular Chili's establishment has a lower overall score, cause I come here no more than twice a month for the past 2-3 years! This place serves amazing food every time, I've never had any problems, and the staff is super courteous! I rate this establishment 5 stars because every visit I've made was perfect in every aspect! And for the record, I never call ahead and reserve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches?start=20,,,,,
5,Heather R.,"Nacogdoches, TX",0,4,,1.0,2014-02-27,Went to eat with my boyfriend and there was a roach crawling on our booth! SUPER GROSS! NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches?start=20,,,,,
26,Bill R.,"Houston, TX",8,72,14.0,4.0,2015-01-25,"Ok I know it's a Chilis, but this is to counter a couple of the less than good reviews.  We were visiting from Houston and were there late Friday night - about 10:30 PM.  Got seated a bit slow and then server initially slow but picked it up considerably - for our party of 9!  Even with their expanded menu, late at night everyone's food was hot and tasty.  I had the Bacon Chicken Avocado sandwich and it was surprisingly good.  My wine was cool and fine, beers appeared cold and enjoyable.   Overall a good experience, especially for a late night.  I would go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
25,Savannah A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",58,19,1.0,3.0,2015-08-17,It was alright. Nothing to crap yourself about though. Our waiter was very kind but could use some work. The food was okay but nothing special. Not too pricey if you order in moderation. Wouldn't be the first to recommend but a good place for a chilled out dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
0,Brooke V.,"Allen, TX",0,2,,1.0,2015-11-01,"Me and my boyfriend ordered carry out from online, the order was supposed to be ready at 8:00 according to the website. We waited for 25 minutes after the quoted time at the restaurant and once we got our food, we opened it at home and it was cold and certainly not freshly made. Terrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches?start=20,,,,,
19,Kerry C.,"Shrewsbury, MA",43,38,28.0,1.0,2016-04-15,"Update: My fiance convinced me to give them a try one more time. We showed up for lunch and there was nobody waiting in line. We stood at the front in plain view for TEN MINUTES and never had anyone acknowledge us. 3 different employees casually made eye contact with me, but nobody ever came to seat us so we finally left and went somewhere else. It wasn't even very busy.  I used to love this location and we frequented it because it was somewhere my fiance and I could both get something we liked. I don't know why, but in the past year it's gone way downhill. All my dishes have been removed from the menu one by one and replaced with unimpressive new items, and the service took a nose dive. The last 5 visits or so have been really disappointing, and the last one will probably be our final try because it was a complete disaster. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
24,Maggie D.,"Nacogdoches, TX",52,5,,1.0,2016-04-21,"The only thing I loved about going to Chilis was to take the chili pot holder, and they don't even have that anymore. The food was okay, but the service was absolutely terrible. The waitress was very untrained and kept sitting down to talk to her friends at the booth across from us. You would think the manager would say something to her but he just sat and talked to them also. Could you be more unprofessional?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
1,Antonio T.,"San Diego, CA",26,3,,5.0,2016-06-09,Chili's Food is Great and Affordable. I like Chili's ambiance and monthly specials. It is always packed for a reason. Reasonable prices for a night out. Service is mostly college students and they mean well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches?start=20,,,,,
27,Randy C.,"Henderson, TX",0,16,,3.0,2016-06-18,"Food was delicious. Service was terrible as if we were forgotten, I like this place and will go back but I hope we r treated better. They need to get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
23,Jane-Ann R.,"San Diego, CA",44,34,2.0,3.0,2016-06-27,Pretty typical for a chilis. Wide variety of food for a decent price. The service is definitely lacking. It always takes forever to get your food. And it's ALWAYS crowded.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
22,Nicole P.,"Nacogdoches, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-09-23,"This Chillis.. idk what happened to them.. my freshman year they were ok. The past two years their grilled chicken meat has been chewy/squishy, their rice has absolutely no flavor, and omg the salmon is not seasoned at all. Also seems that they no longer steam the broccoli.. just nothing seems cooked or flavored quite right anymore. Service is fine, food has gone south.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
21,Laura C.,"Nacogdoches, TX",4,12,2.0,1.0,2016-09-25,"My husband and I went here the day before our anniversary. It took 30 minutes to be seated. Got our appetizer but no silverware. Our waitress was no where to be found. Asked another waiter for silverware. Another 30 minutes later got our food, I got the sunrise bacon burger and it was RAW and the egg tasted like old rancid vegetable oil was used. My husband got a salad with wilted lettuce that had more white core pieces than green leaves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
18,Shane F.,"Nacogdoches, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-12-08,This might be the worst establishment in Nacogdoches. The wait staff is rude and it takes forever to get anything. I waited 20 minutes for the bar tender to get to me on top of waiting over an hour to get my food. I called it in and it was supposed to be ready in 20 minutes. This is Nacogdoches I could have raised my own cow and made a burger faster than this experience took.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
17,David A.,"Lufkin, TX",2,7,,3.0,2017-01-21,The apitizer was the only good thing. The burgers were way to greasy the fries tasted like they had been left in the oven for 1 hour. I tried some of the nachos the were good but put more beans on it. So I do not recommend the service stinks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
16,Chach A.,"Nacogdoches, TX",22,3,,2.0,2017-01-22,"Chili's is losing its touch. While I have never been a big fan of the chain, there are a few items on the menu that have continued to get my business throughout the years. The drinks are above average price but maintain value due to portion and consistency. I have always made a point to try a different house recipe every visit.  Our last visit was on a weekday at around 11:00 am. There were a handfull of tables occupied and about four guests seated at the bar. Only about six guests still had menus on their tables in the entire place. We sat at the bar and waited about 3 to 4 minutes before we were acknowledged and offered menus and drink service. The bartender was polite and knowledgeable. Unfortunately she was also inattentive and poor at following up on service. We ordered a specialty drink and a cape cod. We also ordered a plate of nachos to start us off.  The nachos took over 20 minutes to arrive. I had noticed the bartender go to the back of the house several times during this period but only to finally return with a 2 tops food that had been seated after us. They looked to have fajitas and a hamburger.  5 minutes after that we received our appetizer. The nachos had clearly died in the window. The sour cream had been under the line so long that it melted. The Jalapeno's were on the chips(requested no Japs) but the lettuce was missing(as requested). The cheese was stale and the black beans were dry.  At no time did the bartender follow up on our food or beverages.  I ate a few sad chips, paid the tab and we left. We stopped at chic-fil-a on the way home and finally got lunch.  We will not be returning to the Nacogdoches branch. This was our fourth or fifth attempt to eat there. We did however try the Lufkin branch several days later to satisfy our nacho and baby back ribs craving. It was delicious. Service was awesome. And it was very busy. Their review will be 4 stars and considerably shorter. Get your act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
15,Jackie M.,"San Antonio, TX",49,6,2.0,5.0,2017-03-30,I absolutely love this Chilis. I'm not usually a chilis fan but this restaurant is different and the staff and food are amazing. I eat here almost every time I'm in Nac and anytime we have a staff meeting in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
14,Sonya R.,"Nacogdoches, TX",74,2,,1.0,2017-06-02,"It 3:00 I got here about 2:35 and I'm just getting seated....

20,Marianne K.,"Nacogdoches, TX",0,10,,4.0,2017-06-03,"This isn't the best Chili's you'll go to, but it's good. We've had both good and bad servers, but Karson is excellent. She was attentive, gave us tips on the beers brewed here in Nac, and gave us space, so we could talk. The outstanding thing tonight was the service the staff was providing-huge thunderstorm-they were at the door providing umbrellas for people to get to their cars-even offering to walk people to their cars. How many restaurants do this?? We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
8,Kevin W.,"Mission, KS",187,65,12.0,4.0,2017-07-13,It had been a few months since I had eaten at Chili's.  I ordered the ribs with an additional side of their new roasted corn. The ribs were just as tender as always and covered with just the right amount of sauce. I really like their new roasted corn and I hope they keep in on the menu.  The service was good and servers seemed to be hustling. Very polite and courteous. My drink was kept full.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
10,Kristina I.,"Oceanside, CA",15,96,9.0,2.0,2017-07-14,"I've been here during off hours and have had good experiences...  Unfortunately tonight was not great. We were seated, waited awhile to have our drink order taken. By the time the server came, we were ready to order our food as well.  20 min later our drinks came... a few sips in we realize that there was lip stick on my friends cup. Gross. As expected it takes awhile and at the same time our server brings our food to us that we can grab his attention.  The server rolled his eyes- bothered, not embarrassed by the accident.  We wait some more. Finally he brings us ranch but never a new drink for my friend.  Later, we had to wave down another waitress for my friends drink, refills and everything else we needed.  Then we wait some more as our server again disappeared. Hoping that wed get our bill at some point.  Finally- we get our bill and pay.  Often its not what happen but how you handle it right? The manager was disgusted like we were but said its difficult to get stuff clean, you know... then proceeded to explain how their cleaning processes went.  Uh huh. Ya.  Then he said had we not paid yet he could of took something off the bill but you know, oh well.  Moving on.... as his server is swiping my card. Refund? Gift card? Coupon? So on?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,,,,,
13,Kaycee R.,"Nacogdoches, TX",20,13,,3.0,2017-08-03,"Every time I go here I regret going. There are so many better, local places to eat at. Been here about 20 times.

12,Zulu Z.,"Tyler, TX",128,20,2.0,1.0,2017-09-20,"Just don't do it!  I normally LOVE Chili's.. but this is NOT my Chili's.  Staff is rude and not reliable.  Food took forever and i put that it was ""quiet"" here only because there was no one there... barely any staff or regulars.. everything was sticky or greasy.  DON'T DO IT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
9,Tony A.,"Nacogdoches, TX",27,18,56.0,1.0,2017-09-25,Real simple.  Bowl of chili with some crackers... No crackers. No napkins. Mediocre service.  That's what I get for living in a small town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
11,Giovanni L.,"Round Rock, TX",0,6,,1.0,2017-11-06,"Ordered to-go from here a while back. Arrived and the food was ready in no time apparently. However, due to some lack of communication, we had to wait 45 minutes (no exaggeration) before it was handed to us. For a TO GO order. I was later contacted (by the manager or some Chili's representative, I'm unsure) and laughed at when I said the food was cold. Wtf? They then offered us vouchers or whatever for new meals that were supposed to take several weeks to arrive in the mail. They never arrived.  I contacted Chili's again after that and never got a reply. Needless to say, we no longer even consider Chili's an option when we're going out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nacogdoches,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
