Wait time for a regular table was a half hour, however we were able to grab a high top right by the bar and were served right away. Started off our ""lunch"" with some fried crispy cheese.  The breading was a big thick which made the frying a little strong.  There was more fried breading than actual cheese, but it was still ""ok"". The cheese was a combo of two different types which was fairly tasty, just not much of it.  I had the cheeseburger, can't remember the exact name just remember that it was charbroiled and had cheddar. The burger was not a typical ""burger"" per say, it was served on a partial loaf...baguette size. The burger was rather tasty and well cooked. Great flavor in the burger without drying it out, still a good amount of juice in the burger. The fries were very tasty and not overly salted. Just the right amount of crisp, salty, and moist.  The better half had the salmon. He enjoyed the salmon itself, didn't really care for the sides. The broccoli, as he reports, was cold so he didn't really eat any of it. His other side was mashed potatoes, he ate some of those but he's not a huge mashed potato fan. Service was quick and very pleasant. I would recommend and would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=100,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

Then this is the place for you!  For those of you unfamiliar with Norovirus, it is basically an ""oral-fecal"" illness that derives from poor sanitation combined with food handling. Now I'm no expert, but with some information from the Columbus & Morrow County health departments & some research on my end, I've become very familiar.  You see, I was the first of a handful of people to be afflicted with said Norovirus through the Cheesecake Factory of Polaris. Thankfully some of us came forward & reported it to the health department & they are taking it very seriously. I didn't know this was possible, so next time you suspect you've been contaminated by a restaurant, give them a call. Don't expect it to end there though folks, as they need to be able to prove your food-borne illness came from that particular restaurant, so if you are willing (& I was, as this was my VERY EXPENSIVE birthday dinner), they will ask that you submit stool samples. Specific stool samples. Embarrassing? Yup. But we have a baby, so poop is something I'm a little accustomed to, unfortunately. Anyhow, I digress. My husband was so excited to take me out for a nice birthday dinner.  We just moved here & I've never been to any Cheesecake Factory, so I was stoked! The service? It was good! Our food? It too, was good! The first time..... The other 8-10 times when it came back up, not so good. Trying to care for a 1 year old the day after your birthday with volcanic eruptions coming out of both ends? Priceless... Their only saving grace is that our son didn't get sick as well.

I was also told that the pager would not work in Barnes and Noble and that I should return before the hour so we don't lose our spot.  So we arrived at Barnes and Noble and decide to buy some chai tea and coffee from Starbucks and low and behold our pager goes off. I had to power walk in five inch heels and throw away my chai tea. I was a little irritated that the employee kind of lied to us but also happy that the wait was far less than an hour. The waitress was very attentive and always kept our beverages full at all times. We had ordered calamari and it was overly greasy and the breading kept coming off which exposed the rubbery concoction. I don't like knowing what calamari looks like without its clothes on. On the upper hand, I ordered the filet mignon and of course it was it was amazing. I love the way filet mignon just almost melts in your mouth. The fries that accompanied my steak were far less impressive and had two random onion rings with them. (I loathe onions).

I wish we would've went elsewhere, but she seemed to enjoy herself.  I'll run though my complaints fairly quickly - the decor is gross, the wait was way too long for the place to be this empty, and the food was so-so.  We started off with the fried cheese and it was nothing to brag about. The sauce was too sweet and the outside was burnt. For our lunches, I ordered the herb encrusted salmon and the GF ordered the gumbo. As stated, my food was so-so, the highlight being the mashed potatoes. The portion sizes were alright.

The waiter failed to return to check on me until I was three-fourths done with the burger.  At which time I *finally* got to ask for the ketchup for the fries and pointed out there was a problem with the food.  I said I didn't want to send it back (it was far too late and the rest was okay), but that he really should alert the kitchen that they'd made a mistake.  I even picked up an onion skin strip and demonstrated that you could try to pull it apart but it was very strong and unchewable.  This should have set off alarm bells, but he said something like, ""oh, okay"" and left.  I would've expected a manager to drop by within minutes but that didn't happen, meaning he didn't tell anyone.  Which means that serving bad food wasn't taken seriously.  To be clear, I did not want any sort of comp - no free food or desserts.  I only wanted the business to know about the mistake, take quality seriously and take steps to correct it.  But that did not happen, so we're done with Cheesecake Factory.  I'm going to upload a pic - I think Yelp hooks that to my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=60,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.6000000000000005,3.2400000000000007

He wanted pasta, and since I have this wheat thing, he rarely gets it.  It dawned on me that CF probably had a gluten-free menu, so I gave them a quick call--and they did! I placed our order, and then they told me I could PARK OUTSIDE AND THEY WOULD BRING MY FOOD.  What?! Maybe I'm just easily amused, but the Cheesecake Factory impressed me tonight with their GF menu and the way they let me be lazy.  As for the food, it's your typical CF fare. Everything was good.

This place was packed and super busy, but the service was top notch, and the staff were very attentive. It's somewhat dark which makes it a bit hard to see the menu, and the menu is 19 pages long! That's a bit overwhelming, however there are only about 4 pages that are specific for food and the rest is appetizers, desserts, and other things. Once we figured out the 2 pages that interested us we decided quickly on what to eat. I chose the Chicken Madeira which according to the menu was sauteed chicken breast topped with asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese, covered with fresh mushroom madeira sauce and a side of mashed potatoes.   This meal was very tasty and the portion size was rather large. I was able to take home half of my meal and have it for lunch the next day.   We shared the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (Cheesecake with Caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger and Reese's peanut butter cups).  What a wonderful piece of heaven this cheesecake was.   The food is very good and the portion sizes are very large, however the price for the meals and the cheesecake are also high.  I would like to see a place like this reduce the size of their meals, which would allow the price to come down as well.

We asked for chilled water and the person got us tap water when we asked we were told I got you what I had this is all we have. Really an upscale restaurant can't give its guests cold water. Many will just make an attempt to pour cold water from a pitcher full of ice with minimal ice cubes to make the customer happy.

I refused one more time, and he insisted that it wasn't any trouble and the kitchen won't be mad. I, having not had anything to eat all day, accepted.

While I sit there and watch I see servers are taking care of other guests who came after us but ignored us. Is it because of the color of my skin that made me treated the way I was treated? Or dose Cheescake factory dose not good customer service?

However, if I were to do that, I'd grade my latest experience 1-star.  As far as the pros go, the menu is filled with so many options, no matter how picky one might be, he/she is bound to find something to their liking. The server was also quite friendly. In saying all of that, however, as I was in the mood for something ""Cajun"" and I stumbled upon a speciality dish called ""Cajun Chicken Littles,"" I ordered that and came away extremely disappointed. The dish is described on the menu as: ""Boneless Breast of Chicken Pieces, Spiced, Breaded and Fried Crisp..."" When I took my first bite, I could tell there was absolutely nothing ""Cajun"" about it and nothing ""little"" about it either. When the waitress returned, I asked for some Cajun seasoning, since it had appeared I was served two orders of regular chicken tenders with barbecue sauce on the side. When she returned, she said, ""I'm sorry, but this order isn't Cajun and isn't little. Here's some blackened seasoning. Hopefully that helps."" Really? A dish is called ""Cajun Chicken Littles"" and 2/3 of the title is inaccurate? If I had known the ""Cajun Chicken"" wasn't Cajun, I would have ordered something else.

This time tonite was the worst. Being a Tuesday we thought it would be in and out. We sat down in a timely manner but everything else was super super slow. We waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came over. When he finally came we ordered our drinks and our food. The people next to us got their food right after we ordered. They ate, paid and left. Still no food for us. The waiter said it's coming about 3 times. Then the manager came and apologized and said it's coming. Then another couple sat down next to us. We finally got our food, about 50 minutes later. Meanwhile the couple next to us ate, paid and left before we got our check paid so we could leave. We assumed that after all that we would have some kind of comp on our bill. We did not. Then, to make things worse, I left my (very sentimental) birthday card on the booth seat when we got up. I realized when we were pulling out of the parking lot. I called to have them grab it and the hostess said no one has seen it. I spoke to a manager and she finally admitted that the buser saw it, said there was nothing in it so he threw it away. Super disappointed.

The Cheesecake Factory menu.   When you're with your friends and your conversation transitions into the inevitable ""where do you want to go?"", ""I don't know, where do you want to go?""-- this is the place you go.   There isn't anything I find particularly special about their food (with the exception of their cheesecakes), other than the fact that there is literally something for everyone, and you'll never hate what you order.  It's incredibly consistent and you'll never leave hungry.  Like, ever.  The only thing you'll hate is deciding what to order because there are SO many options.   Also, portions.. WHO EATS THIS MUCH FOOD??  Each entree is large enough to feed a small village and then some.  Now, their cheesecake is above par, although I don't recall actually ever eating cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, because there is simply no room left after dinner.  But I'm resourceful, so I always order it to goooo! And enjoy it as a midnight snack. Do make sure you eat the bread.  Always so warm and SO delicious.   Favorite apps:  1. avocado rolls- if you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out.  2. Calamari- perfectly crispy and so very tasty. 3. Warm crab and Artichoke dip- I could eat this all day, every day.   As for the entrees, I mean, I've never gotten anything I haven't liked, and as far as I'm concerned  neither will you!  My go-to is definitely the chicken Alfredo or the Thai salmon, both good.   If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, make sure you call ahead and make a reservation. It tends to get quite crowded.  Give their Nutella cheesecake a try. It's pretty spectacular!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2,3.04,2.88,2.88,,2.9440000000000004

The manager brought it out and asked us if we were doing ok still, we said yes. He Did not even bother to apologize for the long wait nor did the server even bother to ask us if we wanted a salad or more bread as we were waiting for our food.

The waitress took our order in a timely manner, but after about 20 minutes, the wrong appetizer was delivered to our table.

Once the group finished eating (at about the time we were being served), an awards meeting began.  The leader was standing right by my seat, (with her ""behind"" in my face) calling people up for awards, hugs, and photos.  This STOPPED the wait staff from checking on our table, and stopped our ability to hold a conversation.

2,Robert S.,"Hilliard, OH",1,31,,1.0,2017-11-05,"This place is WAY overrated. I was hardly impressed. They should call this place The Sugar Factory I had dinner at a Japanese restaurant in the Polaris mall food court where I got a huge portion of food at a great price, I decided to come here for dessert. All I could taste in the two different cheesecakes I ordered were just huge amounts of sugar. The pieces of cheesecake I ordered were caramel pecan and some kind of truffle, they're supposed to be different from each other but tasted nearly exactly the same and each layer I bit into had hardly any difference in taste besides just tasting like different textures of sugar. I could hear my kidneys and liver shrieking in pain because of the sugar overload from each bite. This stuff is EXPENSIVE too! Totally not worth the money. they charge a fortune for just one piece of cheesecake, if it tasted amazing I wouldn't mind that, when I go to a grocery store though and buy a mass-produced piece of cheesecake for 1/5 of the cost it should NOT taste better than the one that costs a fortune that i ordered from this restaurant. One of the bakery staff had an attitude with me when I tried ordering too. I was standing in front of the bakery where there were two or three people working on the other side and I waited for someone to ask me if I needed help, I wasn't sure if this where I was supposed to order. No one asks me if I need anything after standing for a good moment. It seems like they assume people go out of their way to stare and admire their cheesecake in the bakery display like it's the Mona Lisa or something. I ask one of the women behind the counter if I can order cheesecake to go from the bakery counter and with an attitude she says ""she needs to help you"".  If you want a nice sit-down restaurant experience there are TONS of other options near by and if you want a great value for your money the food court in the mall has good options too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2,2.64,2.87,2.87,,2.7780000000000005

She was efficient. It was late and my kids were hungry. She could tell and got everything out ASAP. The food was good.  Cheesecake was obviously good.  The bad - As much as we liked our waitress, she couldn't get our wine bottle open. No big deal. My husband handled it, but then she just left the bottle on the table and didn't pour it. Again, no big deal, but not what you are really expecting. My son has a shellfish allergy. I asked right off what our options were. Waitress informed us that everything is made to order and his meal would be made on a separate grill, cooks would switch gloves and to order whatever we would like. Awesome! That was great. But, I have a sneaking suspicion that didn't actually happen. I'm not sure, but I just didn't get that feeling. Regardless, his meal was great so I can't comment more on that.  The worst part though was the banter between the hostesses. We had about a 20 minute wait to be seated. Now I get that this is in Ohio and they may not be used to the southern accent. But as we stood next to the hostess station and waited, a woman with a very southern accent came up and spoke to the hostess. The hostess immediately turned around and made fun of that woman with the other hostess. Very unprofessional. That really shouldn't happen. This lady wasn't rude or demanding.
