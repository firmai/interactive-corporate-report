Nick D.,"Pataskala, OH",0,27,3,4.0,2/13/2016,"If you know me, I avoid writing about chain restaurants, but when the food is better than average, or otherwise, future guests should know. I ordered the lunch portion, bowl of chili and the Chipotle chicken on a bed of lime rice. To keep this short, the flavors had a party in my mouth. Yuh mmy.   Service was good and fast, good food. Great job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Mark A.,"Honolulu, HI",47,265,935,2.0,6/20/2017,"I ate here for lunch one day.  The food was ok, but the service was subpar.  I got there and was seated right away.  There were few other people in the restaurant. I sat down and ordered a margarita.  Despite this, I never received a glass of water.  How often do you eat at a restaurant in this country and get a glass of water automatically? Anyway, I ordered the mango lime chicken.  I tried asking my waitress questions about it or about other things on the menu but she was no help. Eventually I got my food and ate it.  The food was ok, but nothing special. Despite it being marked as spicy, all the heat was in the sauce, which was served on the side; it also meant that without the sauce, the chicken was rather bland. When I was done eating, I asked for the check, and it felt like it took a while to get.  Really, my whole experience here was a let down and I don't think I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Jackie C.,"Carrollton, TX",0,6,,1.0,9/8/2017,"Service and drinks were great. Had the 6oz sirloin and it was basically meatloaf, it actually made me feel sick to cut into it and see the inside. Paid 50 bucks for some drinks and shitty steaks, won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Harrison G.,"Hillsboro, OH",160,275,44,5.0,6/20/2017,Great restaurant. The staff is friendly and they have good chicken and steak and the pop is really good to. I highly recommend this place when in the area. The games on the table they are fun. The staff is personable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Arthur W.,"Spring Valley, OH",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2017,Worst food ever!  Wife had loaded chicken that was cooked in old rancid grease.  I had the beef fajita which was bland and served with strange green rice which tasted horrible. Asked for plain rice but was told this was the only type they served.  Sure can't call this Tex-Mex not even certain it could be called Mexican.  Will never eat here again. Only reason we tried this Chili's is because my wife had eaten the chicken dish at another Chili's and thought it was excellent. NOT HERE!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Jeremy S.,"Dayton, OH",310,5,,1.0,11/7/2016,"Gross.    These fast food places from the 70's just keep getting worse.   Food was gross,  very busy on a Saturday night.   Drugs laying on the floor in pill form.   I didn't look at it but was under our table.   Will not be ba",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Clare G.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,3/20/2016,"I'd visited this location for the second time thinking my experience would be different but not. First visit I'd picked my meal up to go and the pick up area floor was very dirty. Besides the floors being filthy, my meal was incorrect.  Second visit I decided to dine in to give a second chance and this visit was worse! The floor was as dirty as the first visit and they sat my spouse and I near a table that was left with food and dirty dishes that another guest had left. The severs didn't clear the tables nearly 20 mins after. It took 40 mins to receive our meal. Waiter Calli was nice but not sure why it took so long to receive our meal. The location was not busy. Other than that the food was ok but store is VERY DIRTY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Michael C.,"Houston, TX",1,30,1,1.0,12/3/2016,Wait times to get your food or appetizers is beyond ridiculous. The waitress was quick on drinks but took 30 minutes before the appetizer came out. Been 45 minutes and still no food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Phil J.,"Dayton, OH",0,12,1,3.0,3/19/2016,Food is good and staff is friendly but the place just feels dirty. Lots of good options just clean the place up and you will get 4+ stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
steve s.,"Newport, KY",138,91,101,1.0,11/22/2015,I eat out a lot. This has to be the worst service I had in a long time. If you have asking re fills all the time there's a trouble.  The only reason I went there was I had a $25 gift. I would not go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Jan M.,"Minocqua, WI",26,850,2,3.0,11/11/2014,"A friend and I had lunch here yesterday; seated quickly and server at our table just after; still have decent lunch specials.  I had the half margerhta (sp) flatbread and a salad.  Salad was excellent; flatbread was good, but got a bit soggy as I ate.  Not a bad lunch for $6.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Kellie I.,"Springfield, OH",5,45,,1.0,8/2/2015,"First entree was cold, sent it back no apology no manager visit.... Table was dirty and booth seat too.  All entrees very very unimpressive, precooked meat cold onion rings. This place is definitely off the list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Daniel L.,"Clayton, OH",1,38,,4.0,1/24/2016,Food was very good.  We did the 2 for $20 which is great if you like the items on that menu.  The chicken crisper are always good.  Our server was very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Ethan G.,"Springboro, OH",42,13,4,1.0,7/12/2015,Terrible. I have been to chilies in multiple states multiple times and this one is terrible I had been to it in a while because the service was terrible the 3 other times I had been and the food was way over cooked. I ordered carry out about a week ago and the food was just as terrible but I thought maybe it was because of it being carry out so I decided to give it a shot again today. 3 of us walked in sat down for 15 minutes and didn't even get a hello we waited another 10 minutes and left. Letting the hosts know on the way out and they were nothing but rude that we even said anything. Will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Scott S.,"Dayton, OH",83,47,8,5.0,3/1/2014,"I'm not a big chain-restaurant guy... I love indy restaurants. However...  Chili's gets very high marks across the board from me. A wide variety on their menu, decent service and atmosphere. I've eaten at Chili's many times... LOVE the chili queso dip! I get it almost every time I eat there. But what prompted me to write a review was the spicy shrimp tacos! omgosh! So flavorful, and an interesting mix of flavors at that. Very fresh! The term ""flavor explosion"" may be overused in advertising, but it certainly applies in this case! Trust me, if you like that sort of dish, in lieu of a burger or something more overtly Tex-Mex, you won't be disappointed.  Count'em, THREE soft tacos stuffed with shrimp and all the trimmings, with a side of REAL beans and rice. (Not refried beans.) Let me know if you enjoyed them as much as I did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Kim S.,"Dayton, OH",1,20,38,2.0,10/23/2014,"I go to Chillies once or twice a year. Usually have a good experience. But not this last time.   My husband and I wanted to try their new burgers. I ordered mine with american cheese , lettuce , bacon, and mayo. The waitress offered chips and salsa which I thought was a free thing. Some resteraunts will offer them for free. We were not told that we would be charged $4.99 for them. We didn't even eat half of them before our food came. So that was a waste.     When the food came everything looked good. My husband liked his burger but said it was a little salty. My burger tasted good for the first two or three bites but then it started tasting very salty. Then about half way trough.....BAM !! I was ambushed by pickles . I hate pickles! I didn't ask for them so I don't know why they were on there, hideing under the lettuce.    Then to top it all off our bill was a shocker at $32.59 for two burgers, fries,$5 for chips and salsa and 2 Cokes.  I don't think we will ever go back to Chillies. Too expensive and the food is not that good. We should of just went across the street to Logan's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Robert R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,606,38,3.0,10/19/2013,"Solid lunch experience.  Service was good, kept our drinks filled and was prompt.  Food was as expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57,2.0,7/15/2012,"I have to say that I do love Chili's but sadly, not this location. Why you ask? I shall explain... We were seated by a very pleasant hostess who gave us menus that were in severe need of replacement. They were sticky and worn and just overall gross. I didn't even want to let my paws touch them. Yuck! Our waitress was very mediocre. She was not attentive at all. We asked her for a few minutes while we contemplated what we were going to order. Well she sure gave us a ""few"" minutes...like 10 of them. While that doesn't seem like an exorbitant amount of time, it is an eon when you are starving. Service didn't get much better than that. I got the all you can eat soup and salad. I was not asked if I wanted seconds until my salad plate and soup bowl had a long extended absence of food. When I did get my refill on soup I was unable to eat it all. I asked for a ""to go"" bowl and was denied. I was able to get the left-over chips to go however, taking the remaining bowl of soup was a big no-no. I can understand if I was asking for a new bowl to go home with. I could not understand why I could not wrap up the soup that I had already eaten. Apparently this is their policy, one I have never encountered before.  Overall, the whole lack of customer service really left a bad taste in my mouth. Will we be back? Maybe...if we get a hankering for chili's and we are in the area. I would however, ask for another waitress. This one just did not cut it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek

Phillip F.,"Dayton, OH",5,18,,3.0,4/28/2014,"Be careful when you order steak. When my friend ordered the classic ribeye, they don't tell you its a 6oz. You have to ask for the 10oz. Needless to say we had to wait for them to cook another one. Outside of that the food was good. Its not a wow experience. Our waitress was less then stellar. She needs better customer service training or something. The manager was pleasant and handled things very well. I've had better experiences but it isn't the worst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek
Tom S.,"Dayton, OH",74,112,2,3.0,11/11/2014,"Another Veteran's Day visit.  I had their Margarita Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl. It had rice & beans, lettuce, chicken, avocado, and lime.  It was pretty good, kinda tangy. The service was not so great, slow. Not bad though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Andrew H.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,8/12/2014,Terrible service won't eat here again everything was burnt had to have them take it back so it took another 25 minutes to get our food then they of course still want to charge you full price without even apologizing for wasting your time with their mediocre food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Destiny J.,"San Antonio, TX",15,10,,2.0,10/31/2013,"I was already on edge about eating at this location. Upon entrance the menus were sitting on a serving tray with a hand written paper sign that said "" please wait to be seated"". Anyway I had the spicy shrimp tacos they were too spicy that I couldn't even enjoy them and I LOVE spicy food. Let's just say the only thing that was good were the margaritas. That same night my stomach cramped up so bad and I've been having a rumbling stomach and loose stool for 2 days since I ate there. I will never eat there again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Sandy P.,"Springfield, OH",1136,105,688,1.0,5/4/2014,"I don't expect much from chain restaurants. However this was worse than expected.  I've never eaten at Chili's before so when we sat down I asked Leena, our server, what they were known for.  She said the southwestern egg rolls were the best and their food was the best.  She suggested the watermelon margarita so I ordered it.  It was not made according to the menu.  There was no sugar or salt on the rim; no lime and the watermelon puree was a few days too old.  It was really a poorly made drink.  She said either Rich or Keith made it but whoever it was needs bartender 101.  We got the trio appetizer with eggrolls, potato skins and artichoke dip.  The egg rolls were descent, the potato skins were still cold in the middle and the artichoke dip was good with plenty of nacho chips. The smokehouse burger did not come with 4 slices of bacon as the menu states. Maybe the cook thought three was enough.  It was cooked well done when ordered medium.  The fries had no seasoning on them.  It was mediocre at best.  The buffalo wings arrived plain; they needed a sauce or something to make them have some flavor.  They actually tasted as though they'd been made beforehand and then just reheated in a microwave. They were mushy not crisp.  I didn't order anything I was already so disappointed with the cocktail and appetizer there was no need to waste more money.  This location has no much competition that you'd think they'd work even harder to make their food stand out. Not the case here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Rachel D.,"Palatine, IL",16,52,3,4.0,10/30/2013,"Great lunch experience.  Fast and efficient service. The servers were on top of our drinks and even offered a ""to go"" cup for my soda.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Brian K.,"Pittsboro, NC",3,58,7,3.0,9/25/2012,This is a Chili's.  It is the same as every Chili's.  If you already like Chili's you'll be happy.  If you don't already like Chili's this one's a fine place to give it a try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Annie M.,"Dayton, OH",14,91,14,4.0,5/28/2011,"I read other reviews as we were waiting to be seated and felt a bit remorseful at choosing Chili's for our lunch.  However, as you can tell from my 4 star rating, I had a very positive experience.  My only comment was that it took, perhaps a bit too long to be greeted and seated.  Yet once seated the service was wonderful an our food was quite good.   I ordered a rib-eye and it was cooked to perfection.  The loaded mashed potatoes were quite good.  My husband got a burger an it was very good as well.   We'll definitely go back again.  I should note that we were there quite late in the afternoon, and the restaurant was not busy! Perhaps that is why we had such good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Sarah F.,"Columbus, OH",125,512,202,1.0,2/14/2012,"Yuck. First, they sit the 6 of us at a table that really seems to be for 4. I took the window seat and I literally had to climb over the chair because there was no room to get in at all. The whole time I was uncomfortable and angry. Then, my sister orders something off their ""light"" menu, and it comes with a butter soaked bun and cheese covered broccoli. Not exactly low cal friendly. She asked for a different bun, and they only brought her another top! Just half!!! I couldn't believe it. The burger I got, veggie burger, was boring and not great, and my coke was flat. I used to love this location years ago, not sure what happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Jay M.,"Boston, MA",41,235,,4.0,1/30/2012,"Went on a busy Friday night - was very happy that we called ahead.  We were seated right when we got there.  Service was good and food was very good.  Had the chicken sandwich and fries - both came out very hot and very fresh (I get the same thing at every Chilli's I go to and sometimes it is hit or miss).  I would recommend this Chilli's, just a cautionary note to call ahead so you don't have to wait a long time to be seated (they allow it if there is a wait)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20

Benny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,223,,4.0,7/6/2011,"Had a great meal at this Chili's a few days ago.  The queso dip and chips appetizer was extremely flavorful.  I got chicken club tacos, which were made perfectly, tons of food, and I really enjoyed it.  Service was great as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
Ryan P.,"Centerville, OH",101,331,36,3.0,3/28/2011,"Kinda nostalgic since I ate here all through college, but there is an upside.  Since it is near a university there is no shortage of good, young servers paying their way through school.  This place gets crazy busy on weekends due to the shortage of restaurants in Beavercreek.  Parking can be a problem.  The food is like any Chili's.  I like the chicken nachos because they put a jalepeno on each chip!  Chain restaurant, affordable, nummy, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20
