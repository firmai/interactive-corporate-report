He was a little rude to us when we dared to make the suggestion that we order food.  It took forever for our food to come out, and my order was not as I'd requested, not to mention the chicken was really undercooked.

64,Jeff R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",47,134,59.0,1.0,2014-04-07,"I would absolutely give 0 stars if Yelp allowed it, I hate Applebee's to begin with and this location did nothing to try and change the perception of this poorly run restaurant chain.  I decided to eat here based solely on its proximity to my hotel (walking distance) and the fact I recognized the brand name and you can mostly count on getting average food pretty quickly.  I will give them credit for 1 thing; we were greeted promptly and seated immediately, it's all down hill from this point. First issue is that the bartender (Stephanie G) was not interested in delivering service and rudely signaled to the hostess to find out our drink order after she noticed us get seated at a high back table in the bar area.  Simple order of Diet soda and Blue Moon beer, soda was quick, beer took almost ten minutes.  Despite the restaurant being far from capacity, 10 minutes for a beer is pretty ridiculous.  By the time Stephanie came over to our table we were ready to order, again simple order of two sandwiches and fries.  Apparently too complicated for this place.  Received appetizer and salad after about 15 minutes and finished my beer waiting for entrees.  After more than 15 minutes with an empty glass, Stephanie took time away from her friends at the bar to inquire about a second beer, I asked about the food and was told it was on the way.  She brought a second round and we waited an additional 10 minutes before our food arrived.  Stephanie said she would wait until 9:00 to ring the beer so she could save me $3, how thoughtful...only problem is I would have paid more just to get service and prompt food delivery.  I would avoid this place like the plague, food is just average but the service is a complete joke!!  If you are a local with tattoos all over your neck and arms and know the bartender, you will be treated like royalty and get personalized service and great conversation.  If you are a businessman from out of town, forget it!  Ironically the businessman is going to tip significantly more for great service while the tattooed local is not!  It's pretty clear this location doesn't care and obviously doesn't read their Yelp reviews or things would change.  I will never return and will let all of my co-workers who travel here for business to stay away as well.  Maybe some day when I'm broke, covered in tattoos, and trying to get into the bartender's pants I will return since I'm guaranteed stellar service....and I won't have to tip!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2?start=40,1.64,1.64,1.64,1.6360000000000001,1.6400000000000001
37,Monica S.,"Ukiah, CA",21,3,,1.0,2014-04-23,"ZERO STARS!! I will not eat at ANY Applebees after my horribly rushed lunch today. Within 3 MINUTES of sitting down, our server (toe-head blond with tattoo's covering her left arm) approached our table FIVE TIMES to say, 'not trying to rush you, but are you ready to order yet'. I hadn't even OPENED my menu the first time and was trying to enjoy a luncheon conversation with my husband. The last time she came to the table, I just pointed at something on the menu and said, 'Fine. I'll just take whatever this is' and she said OK and walked away. It was not what I wanted to order but she was OBVIOUSLY not going to let me look at my menu before deciding. The restaurant was not busy and there were several other employees working, so there was NO excuse to treat us like this. My husband and I frequently eat out and will definitely AVOID Applebees from here on out. She was so extremely rude that I hope she gets fired so no one else has to feel that rushed and forced to eat food they didn't even want. We paid over $50 to be treated like SHIT that was sitting in someone else's way and wasn't leaving fast enough. There were PLENTY of empty tables - was she just trying to make sure she pocketed the tip before her shift was over? NO, she SAID she was rushing us because she wanted to get our order in before another server got their 'big' (8 people I think) order in. I should have a CHOICE of when I order.

The service was terrible.  We waited at the door for almost 5 min and we weren't greeted during this time either. Then when we did get sat we waited 4 more min for the server to acknowledge us. Once we placed our order she brought out plates for the appetizers and when we went to take the plates they were filthy  how she missed this is beyond me they were that dirty. When we got our appetizers the cheese wasn't even melted so we had to send it back. At no time did a manager come by our table. The food was mediocre at best.  We have eaten at many Applebee's and never have we had such bad service.  If I could give them negative stars I would.

51,Clarke J.,"Vallejo, CA",47,114,1.0,1.0,2015-12-31,"Spotted silverware that's fairly ugly looking, perhpas the worst I've ever seen at a chain. Either the rinse isn't hot enough, or they're not running enough soap . . either way; one has to ponder things like sterilization, germs and you. Table-tops aren't much better, often sticky, food bits. But here's the new rub: Their nifty littke screen gizmo, which is supposed to be the new Point of Service for your mobile payment . . this thing asks you questions about classic cars and what not . . and then you get $1.99 added to your bill for playing games? There was NO screen indicating a charge or fee for service or product. Let me say that again: There was no accept/decline fee for use. I would say at this point that Applebees is raking significant extra $$ without customers not even feeling the three or four dollar padding that's being done. A good attorney could make legal hay against the chain for non-disclosure, I'd guess. We got our money back after complaining. No big deal if the food had been good! But it wasn't. Caesar salad was dry, pieces cut huge. (Grade C-)  What looked entertaining on the menu: Applebees ""Loaded Brisket Enchilada"" supposedly errupting with seasoned beef, covered in green sauce, garnished with sour cream and Jalapeno slices. Reality? Barely detectable meat portion. Miniscule comes to mind. Ended up being a glop of wet rolled flour tortillas, drenched in green sauce, sour cream as shown with hot pepper slices, and some pretty poor version of what should've been some tasty cheese . .  and a big 'ol pile of rice. (Grade D) $13.99 for a plate that no self-respecting Taquiera would EVER send out of the kitchen. Didn't even bother with a ""to-go"" bag. This location needs a management level shake-up. Can't imagine whoever is invested here being happy with the product, or their bottom line. I always thought that it was Chili's or TGIFriday's that might suffer on the national scene, but I could be wrong. With my wifes' Fiesta Lime chicken, two lemonades . . it came to $38+.

Took the server 10 minutes to get over to the table and 25 minutes for our beer to get there. The server was rude and un-accommodating. We waited over an hour for our food and the entrees arrives before the appetizers. I ordered the nachos. I can barely call them nachos since there was zero cheese on them. When I asked for more cheddar cheese our waitress brought me back a bowl of hot gooey spicy assortment of some form of rubber. My brother ordered the steak, 75% of it was fat and inedible. What you could eat was so hard and dry it could have been sitting out for days.

That's the ONLY thing that happened quickly. After our waitress took our drink order and we looked at the menu we decided on 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. The waitress brought back the drinks, forgetting the water. She mentions that she will be back with the water. She promptly forgets this, and serves two other tables water. I had to flag her down twice and ask her to refill the drinks. The appetizers came out and we ate them. The waitress came back to the table well after we were finished and asked if we wanted more chips with our spinach dip (which was gone.) We said no. At this point, three other tables that came in well after us have gotten their dinners. One has actually finished and LEFT ALREADY. The waitress took away the appetizer plates. We have now been at this establishment for an hour, and our entrees are nowhere to be seen. At this point two other tables are upset because one hasn't had their order taken after 20 minutes, and the other had some kind of issue with the food. Both tables requested the manager, and one left very angrily. The waitress ignores us for another 15 minutes. She finally comes back to the table, after we have been there for nearly an hour and a half and says that ""the kitchen messed up on your wrap, and the tag got 'bumped' so they are starting your food now."" I tell her that I want her to cancel the food, and bring us the check for the appetizers we have already eaten. This is not the first time the service in this establishment has been EXTREMELY SLOW.

Come inside, immediately tell the hostess Lily that there is a dog outside in distress. She says 'yeah some people have told us that'. We asked Lily what the restraint was going to do, had the police been called and she just gave us a blank stare and ignored us while taking the couple ahead of us to their seats.  We sat at the bar and I WATCHED Lily walk up to a table that appeared to be her friends and let them know that we had called animal control.

Does your dog have thumbs?! If not, the dog most likely would struggle with pouring itself some water.  Once Lily alerted the couple with their infant that the police had been called the hurried out to beat the police. Lily made sure to hug them on their way out the door.

He may as well be the only wait staff because it seemed as if he was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
18,April H.,"Rohnert Park, CA",65,6,,2.0,2017-10-01,"We've been here since 5pm.  Waited 20 minutes to be seated because they couldn't find the hostess.  When she finally surfaced, there were SEVERAL parties that needed to be seated so the servers were really backed up.... 5:50 and our appraiser finally comes out (only because we ordered on the the little table screen) we still don't even have any utensils, we had to get them ourselves from the hostess station. The ""beers on tap"" list is not up to date even though it's hand written. The hostess just keeps walking by looking confused, but I guess, at least she is finally on the floor. ... And hour and 15 minutes in since we got here, still no entrees.. the only reason this is even getting a second star is because the manager felt bad about making us wait  so long for our food and he comped the most expensive item.  And was trying to do everyone else's jobs when they couldn't be found.  The manager was the only person we were impressed with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
5,Carol R.,"Ukiah, CA",19,4,,1.0,2017-10-04,"By far the worst experience I've ever had here. We got there around 9:00pm, it too 15 min. To get someones attention, another 10 minutes to get a drink, which the Margarita tasted like sugar. And then had flag someone down to order. Finally got the order (which was just appetizers) and then had to get someone to bring, plates, napkins, forks. Horrible service. Did not deserve even a tip and I always tip 20%.

1,Monique S.,"Ukiah, CA",2,37,2.0,1.0,2017-10-19,":(  Oh Applebees. We came here because we had a gift card and decided to try it out again. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 meals. The appetizers were actually ok, especially the spinach/artichoke dip, but oh man - the rest of the food was just bad. The macaroni and cheese with chicken tenders sounded great, but the bottom of my bowl was covered in oil? It was all wet and just gross. I didn't eat more than three bites. My husband's food was cold and bland.  We are super disappointed, because we did have some great service and the place was nice and clean.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
12,Bob W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",84,1,,1.0,2017-10-23,"Service was slow, food to our table took over 40 minutes with one meal taking an additional 15 more minutes. The second round of drinks ( not bar drinks ), our server forgot about them and we had to remind her after 20 minutes. There were plenty of staff to go around. The manager did not apologize for the delay, in fact she tried to make a joke of it. I've been this restaurant in the pass with out any problems and have traveled up and down the state, without any problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
8,D L.,"Minden, NV",5,6,,1.0,2017-11-15,"40 minute wait for my meal.  When I finally got it, it wasn't as ordered.  Asked to speak to the manager, 15 minutes later she shows up.  Very condescending, offered to make another meal, when I said at that point I'd been there an hour, she said I wasn't willing to wait for a meal. Horrible service.  I won't be going to any Applebee's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

0,Chris B.,"Brea, CA",54,110,33.0,4.0,2017-12-05,"Like others say, this is an Applebee's, not fine dining.  That all said, the family and I were on a vacation and stopped in town for the night.  We settled on this spot, stumbling distance from our hotel, and weren't disappointed.  Everything we ordered came as expected; what really set the place apart was the service.  They went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant dinner, and once one of the kids spilled something immediately remedied and replaced. Sure seems in reading recent reviews that our experience was an isolated incident, unfortunately, so here's a positive review to bring the average back up a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-ukiah-2,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
