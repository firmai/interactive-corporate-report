Eustacia P.,"Catlettsburg, KY",84,22,2,5.0,10/18/2017,"This is the best Chili's in East Tennessee! The service is always exceptional, as is the food. My special order is always perfect, and the service is very fast. I always make a point to eat here when I'm in Kingsport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport

Kristi R.,"Charlotte, NC",35,2,,1.0,12/28/2016,Aweful kitchen service. Waited 35 minutes to get our food and that was after waiting 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge that we were even there. There were short staffed but weren't slammed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport
April C.,"Kingsport, TN",142,1,,1.0,2/1/2017,"Last week my family and I went into Chili's for lunch. (Myself, my fiancé, and my 1 year old daughter) The hostess was unbelievably rude. She looked at us and said we could sit wherever and as we said we would just sit in a booth over in the bar area - as it was practically empty over there. She then stopped us and said you can't sit over there though. ""Your kid's gonna be in the way."" I told her we have sat over there before about this same time of day and that it has never been a problem. She rolls her eyes and says, ""I'm just telling you. You can't sit there because she will be in the way."" Mind you, we were going to sit at a back booth that's not elevated, so the high chair would not have been too low. We've also sat here a handful of other times at this same booth, with a high chair and no problem. They sent us a letter with a be our guest gift card to compensate, but I won't be back. In the letter they stated that high chairs aren't recommended at their booths for safety measures. Where were the safety concerns whenever we sat in the same booth with a high chair previously? I will be giving the gift card away to someone else that could use them. I'll be sure to warn them to not bring their kids with them though, as they could be potentially be in the way.  Tip for management - train your employees on the importance of proper customer service and how they handle situations could make or break a diner's experience. Had your hostess handled this better, I would not have been so angry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport
Tatum S.,"Euclid, OH",1,3,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Don't order drinks here unless you want to be interrogated about your identity. I was dressed comfortably with my hair in a bun and no makeup on, showed the server my ID to order a drink, and he proceeded to tell me that my ID photo ""didn't look like me"". He then, ignoring me, looked to my boyfriend and asked him, and I quote, ""No bullshit?"" We were shocked and insulted. He then took my ID into the kitchen, and the manager came out with my ID and told me that he would ""let it go...THIS time"". Unbelievable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport
Dean C.,"Kingsport, TN",468,92,,2.0,1/15/2016,"I've been to several locations of Chili's and the food has been at least four stars, but in my two visits to this location, it has been a disappointment. The first time I had lunch here over a year ago, I suspected the food wasn't cooked on clean equipment because later on I had the runs. Yesterday I ordered chips and salsa for appetizer, they were good, and a bacon cheddar burger for lunch, which was over-cooked, lacking flavor, and I detected hints of flavors of other things that were cooked on the grill, on my burger, which tells me they didn't clean the grill before cooking my burger. If they don't clean their grill regularly, which else do they not clear regularly, in the kitchen? Maybe Gordon Ramsay should pay them a visit and inspect the kitchen and walk-in fridge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport
Melanie Q.,"Kingsport, TN",7,1,2,5.0,2/4/2015,Always a good time here! Some of the best bartenders in town and always a drink special! I love this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport

Kimetha H.,"Blountville, TN",2,60,23,5.0,5/13/2010,We ate at Chili's last week and as always we were happy with our choice to go there. My fried shrimp was perfect and a nice touch was they removed the tail shells for me. My husband's dinner salad was big and crispy and delicious. My fried cheese was also excellent. Who could ask for anything more?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport
Lyn W.,"Duffield, VA",7,1,,5.0,4/29/2010,"The food is really good, especially the salads, which are super fresh.  My husband always orders a pasta dish.  Love, love, love the appetizers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsport
