Raquel S.,"Philadelphia, PA",49,219,8,4.0,9/1/2012,"Showed up dead tired after work not expecting much...actually, I saw the bad reviews and expected the bottom of the barrel. I was just hungry and wanted something to eat and the ability to actually look across at my boyfriend you know, one time this week. The restaurant smelled great outside when we got out of the car, and was packed when we walked in. The hostesses argued over whose turn it was to seat us when we walked in and one reluctantly got up and did it without as much as acknowledging us. We were sat next to one of the most obnoxious, ridiculous groups of people I have honestly ever seen eating out. The most foul things were coming out of everyone mouths, talking about the baby's dirty diapers, and the 18 year old telling her mom she barely had time to shit before she showered that morning. I guess the clientele reflects the neighborhood. Our server offered the server who was overwhelmed with the aforementioned party some help with us, and I'm glad she did because she was great and very sweet. Everything was on point with her-- I changed my order (after the kitchen messed my salad up by putting the dressing on and on the side), she brought share plates, new waters--with lemons without us asking.  The garlic sirloin was great as well. I never thought I'd like a steak from an Applebee's. But, I really thought it was good and would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-20?start=20

Amanda R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,41,21,1.0,4/26/2015,"So I came here on the 18th, which was last Saturday. I came after 9pm for the half off appetizers. I saw that they had pot stickers as an app so I decided to try them. They had 2 different size portions. I decided to get the smaller portion. When they brought me the food they were missing a pot sticker. I figured I'd get my money's worth so I told the server (Sam). Now usually food should be checked for any type of error but it wasn't and I had to wait for them to make some more pot stickers. By this time I was not pleased with the food. Sam then decided to bring out 1 additional pot sticker. Now usually, when this type of error occurrs, you should bring 2 maybe 3. But one lonely pot sticker on a giant plate apparently sufficed. Either way it didn't matter because I didn't like the pot stickers after all. She proceeded to bring us every other thing we ordered. Besides this, she didn't check on us at all. We didn't get ant refills. We weren't asked how the food was, especially for what had just occured. Service was terrible. To top the night off, we had to literally keep an eye on our belongings, as there were hostesses telling us that people leave things and/or things are stolen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-20?start=20

Umi R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,75,12,2.0,7/4/2012,"I have been to three other Applebee's besides this one and I have to say this one is the worst so far. The server is the only reason this place is getting another star from me. The place does NOT look clean whatsoever. You walk in and feel you need a shower. We were seated right away which is nice. Now I have food allergies and I wanted a Bourbon black & bleu burger which comes with mushrooms, onions and peppers. I did not want the peppers due to my sensitive stomach. The waitress comes back to tell me the cooks yelled at her for even asking them to remove the peppers and that it was impossible. I had to have everything removed from the burger (mushrooms and onions). Then she tells me I can have the mushrooms and onions on the side for an extra price. I was so disgusted they would charge for something that should have been with the meal to begin with. I don't blame the waitress though since I know it was those terrible 'cooks' over in the kitchen.  Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-20?start=20
Robin S.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",3,216,,3.0,11/4/2012,"Came in with a big party and they were able to get us in on a pretty busy night so that was a plus. Food came out in a timely manner. Service was decent. I would have given 4 stars but the way the waitress handed the tip situation and basically demanded that I write a tip on my receipt (I'm a former server so I would never not tip and I don't know what she was thinking, but her whole attitude about the tip was unnecessary.)

Even the long island ice tea drink was awesome! The NY strip steak was amazing!! The meat was very flavorful, and the service we got was so good, that we gave the server a 20 dollar tip on a 71 dollar order. I mean it was holidays, so we bumped the tip in part for that reason.

Sara J.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,3/23/2015,"The worst customer service I ever experienced!!!!!!!!!!  I went to the Roosevelt BLVD location to pick up a to go order that involved numerous things including a dessert. I had a coupon for a free dessert, and when the young lady came to  my car and gave me my bag, I gave her the money and she went inside to cash me out. A couple minutes later the manager came and said that I could NOT use the coupon I had to get my free dessert. She said I would have to ""drop in"" to get my dessert. I explained the last time I was there, my husband and I received such horrible service that the manager gave us 2 of those cards. She began to argue with me! This woman was so rude, with NO sense of customer service skills whatsoever that I ended up leaving everything that I ordered, because I refused to spend 1 dime of my  hard earn money to this location with such horrific service yet again!! Well no wonder our service was lacking so much last time we dined in. Is this the leader, this is whom the staff is learning from!!! OMG!!! I am literally speechless! I didn't want anything from the store and I will never be back to that location again! This African American woman, and I suppose she was the manager who was simply just rude and nasty nasty nasty nasty!! Perhaps she should take courses on management 101 before you unleash her to us folks who are spending our hard earned money.  You should really rethink about who you have in position of management! When it comes to customer service skills, if a person does not have it, understand it or buy into it,  then perhaps they should work in the kitchen where they won't have first hand dealings with the public.  This black lady was just rude and nasty, and the way she looked at me the way she spoke to me, I would rather spend my money elsewhere then spend it at that Applebees!!!!

Barbara B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,30,,2.0,9/29/2013,"Staff is friendly. Occasionally I get a slow waiter/waitress. The food is usually good but not enough for the money. They give u these giant bowls/plates with a tiny amt of food. Just tried the American BLT - which says- Six slices of crisp Applewood smoked bacon piled high and smothered with melted American cheese on freshly toasted Tuscan bread with smoky mayo, fresh iceberg lettuce and tomato slices. Thats a lie! It's 3 pcs of bacon. Since they cut the sandwich in half I guess that's the 6pcs they are counting. And.... my smokey mayo was on the side. WHY? Why would you put it on the side unless I ask for it on the side? I was not impressed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-20?start=20

Drinks are usually amazing, but for some reason, yesterday I had a pretty awful bloody Mary. They usually prepare this drink in a huge goblet with a lime and olives, yesterday it was a beer glass. Tasted really odd. I'm guessing its a new bartender or something. All in all, its a good place, fun atmosphere, and great food.

The staff is pretty nice but you can tell they hate there jobs. Their face says it all. Lmfao  The alcholic beverages are pretty good but will creep up on you if your not careful.

Anda P.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,14,39,2.0,11/30/2017,"I stopped in for a catch-up w the sister and her beau, we were greeted and seated immediately - the host, Duwayne (sorry if I spelled it wrong!) was so very polite and friendly. I asked if the Sixers game could be put on one of the TVs, and he said, of course-he would check with his manager. Bonus points to Duwayne & manager for delivering (even though the Sixers did not prevail). We tried several of the appetizers - chicken wings w bone in, the chicken wonton tacos, chicken quesadilla, mozzarella stix, they were all delicious and i can't remember what else. I enjoyed the wonton tacos very much and would suggest them! I also had a "" red apple sangria"" and it was delicious! The garnish was fresh and tasted amazing!!!!!!! There was a check mishap- and that's where it went downhill... since there were special pricing for happy hour- for whatever reason, i was charged regular price for all the drinks we had... it took two tries and wayyyy too long to have the adjustments made. (I'm actually stilllll waiting; and now i might be hungry again after this saga- approx 30 mins maybe more).  The place looks nice since it was recently rebuilt from  the fire they suffered. Anyhow, I wouldn't make an effort to return, the time I am waiting to pay for my check is very frustrating.  I am still waiting ... yikes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-20
Linda S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,1.0,12/6/2017,"My school chum took me here for my birthday dinner.  We were seated almost immediately; however, the service was deplorable after that.  We waited almost 15-20 minutes for a waiter.  Finally we got a supervisor who apologized for lack of attention and brought us plates, napkins and silverware and he said our waiter would be with us shortly.  Shortly turned into another 15-20 minute wait.  The waiters looked at us seated there, but no one would wait on us.  We were getting ready to walk out when finally a waiter came.  We both ordered a salad as an appetizer - I had the house salad which supposedly was lettuce, tomato, egg, cucumber, croutons and bacon.  Well, there was a lot of lettuce and little else.  The rest of the ingredients were ""chopped"" so fine they were virtually unnoticeable.  My friend asked for bacon in hers and didn't get it.  Had to wait 5 minutes to get waiter's attention yet again for the bacon.  I had the American burger with pickles, onion, bacon and cheese.  I looked at the burger and said where's the onion, pickles and bacon.  He said they chop it into the burger.  Huh?  The fries were just passable...could have been crisper.  My friend was not thrilled with her barbecued ribs - lots of bone and fat, very little meat. This place is so over rated, poorly managed and wait staff ignorant.  Plus the place was highly noisy, making conversation with my friend who sat right across the small table difficult, and with TV's everywhere tuned into sports channels it was annoying.  Sorry to say, we won't be going there anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-20

Susan M.,"Philadelphia, PA",36,12,2,1.0,7/16/2014,"Even if the food here was superb, which it wasn't, the service really killed it all. While taking our order, the server decided to sit down with us. I understand it is good to be comfortable with your guests, but i do believe there is a thin line which he overstepped and that was very unprofessional.  While my two friends ordered a three cheese chicken with penne pasta, i ordered a freshcada chicken entree. However, that was not what came. Instead, I received another entree and so they took it back and gave me what I ordered. When my friends and I ordered the dessert shooters, we thought it was very good so we ordered another one with the little tablet provided to us. However, it never came and the server came and told us it might not have gone through. So, we just told him to forget about it because we were kinda full anyways.  Upon receiving the check, there were two orders of the shooters on there so our server told us he would take the check to his manager to change it. The manager comes to us and instead of apologizing for the mistake, she tried to pin the blame on us and told us that the machine asks twice if we would like to order before actually placing the order. When I explained to her what happened, she said ""i'll take it off this time but I'm letting you know for next time if you don't want it, dont order it.""  That was the rudest service every given and if I was taught any less than my mother taught me, I would've got in her face.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-philadelphia-20

Also, they have brownie bites with ice cream...for only $1...and it's the perfect size for a dessert that you can still split and not feel too gross after.
