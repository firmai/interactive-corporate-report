Joseph S.,"Severn, MD",5,93,250,3.0,1/13/2018,"TGI Fridays is my go-to restaurant for American food. They have consistently maintained the best quality and menu line-up compared with their direct competition amongst the national chains. Half price apps are always a hit with the family. Everyone can get something they like and eat as much as they want. Good for when you have hungry teenagers and are looking to treat them without caring about having a really balanced meal!  For entrees I really enjoy their burgers and sizzling chicken dishes. They also have a good selection of drinks. This location near the mall can be quite busy at times. But service is usually good and they keep the place nice and clean. I like the mobile app and reward program, but for some reason this location has taken a step back and disabled mobile payments.  Overall a good place to stop for a meal if you are in the area shopping. They also have good lunch specials for a quick bite during the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Mike B.,"Reno, NV",48,258,2412,4.0,11/24/2017,"After traveling all day, we stopped here after landing at BWI. There are not many options at 5pm on Thanksgiving day. And we still had a couple hour drive to visit family. It was not very busy but at least they were open. We went in and had a seat at the bar. We were greeted by the bartender with menus as soon as we sat down. We checked out the menu and placed our orders. Our food was brought out in a timely fashion and looked good. It tasted good as well.  The food was good, the service was good and we were on our way in a short time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Amayi G.,"Glen Burnie, MD",36,42,126,2.0,9/11/2017,"Came here this past weekend mainly had a desert craving and being that it was my birthday felt like I could have my cake and eat it to! Lol Walked in was really busy for a Sat nite wasn't to much past 10pm. There where alotta families and teenagers hanging out. Which is prob norm since it is right across street from Arundel Mills mall. Told greeter a table for two and they sat my fiance and I down at a Boothe.  This is where the three stars come in. Waitress comes gives us menus we already know were here for mainly desert. But still wanted time to choose and it's not like there desert options are that many four to be exact.  I go to the restroom and it's right by the kitchen entry/exit area and it's jus really slippery around that area. How nobody falls is beyond me. I had to skid my heels jus to get the slickness off. Waitress asks if we wanted to start out with drinks I tell her for now I would like a glass of water. She says some kinda smart remark like ""We waited around for that"". My finance looks at her and waitress did one of those I think I'm funny laugh to a oh it wasn't funny serious face. (Fiance told me she wanted her order while I was gone but she wanted wait for me hence the lame smart ass remark.) She says ok and verbally tells us about the happy hour which I had no intentions of getting since I been drinking all day and wanted slow down for an event the next day.  She comes back with my water and asks are we ready to order. I tell her I want the Vanilla bean cheese cake and my fiance asks for the brownie. I then ask about the iced tea drinks before she leaves and if it's sweetened. She just simply says no. There wasn't any recos of similar drinks if any just a plain flat no.  I'm thinking ok as she wasn't really interested in meeting my needs. The cheese cake arrived which was the best part of being there. It tasted just like vanilla bean with a hint of cheesecake. Very flavorful. It was plated nicely. My fiance didn't care for her brownie her exact words were ""Extra fudgy and way to rich"" which promted her to order a glass of water.  We waited a good 10 - 15 mins as our waitress walked past us and went to her other tables as she can see we were done and looking up actually at her to see when she would stop and service us again.  Not coming back thanks for the cheesecake! The two stars were for the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Serah N.,"Silver Spring, MD",25,13,8,1.0,1/7/2018,The food here is absolutely disgusting. The chicken is so dry that I almost literally choked. The broccoli was burnt and tasted like a old mans fart. This meal taste like cardboard just like the food they used to serve back in high school. I wouldn't be surprised if the chef here was actually the lunch lady from my high school. If Gordon Ramsey was here he would definitely burn this place down for how nasty the food is. I'm never coming back here again. I would rather eat dog food than this crap.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover

Na H.,"Baltimore, MD",89,329,2093,3.0,2/16/2017,"Came here for lunch with a group. The line was short and we were seated right away by the host, who was pleasant. We didn't wait long for the server, who was also pleasant, took our drink orders and arrived with them in a decent time. Our group ordered the lunch combo for $8.99, which included one order of 2 Jack Daniel's sliders, French onion soup and fries the other included the Jack Daniel's sliders, friesand mac and cheese. I ordered a cheesburger with fries and the other party ordered the three appetizer platter with wings, mozzarella sticks and potatoe skins. Again, our order came in a decent time and the food was hot, fresh and as tasty as Friday's food could be. One party ordered a blueberry alcohol drink and had to send it back because ""they must have put a capful of liquor in it""(a direct quote from them).  All in all, a nice lunch option for a ""friday"" afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Ashley C.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",124,88,103,4.0,6/29/2017,Actually we had good service today. The ribs are the only reason I knocked down one star. They took exceptionally long. I was actually worried about the ribs based on previous reviews but we were actually pleasantly surprised. The bartenders kept coming back and checking on us so overall it was a good visit. I will say if you are one of the first to sit in the cocktail area you are better off ordering from the bar.  The time it takes them to come outside the bar and take your order is another reason why I took a total of one star down,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Walker C.,"Halethorpe, MD",65,137,241,4.0,1/27/2017,"Met some coworkers here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant seemed pretty clean and I was greeted immediately after walking through the door.  Once seated our order was taken and the food arrived in a reasonable time, even with a decent sized crowd. I had a grilled chicken Cobb salad. It was beautifully played and tasted fresh.  My coworkers had a piece of cheesecake afterwards and again, great presentation. For not being a fancy restaurant, they did a great job. I would go back. Plenty of party in a large lot and appears to be well lit by the number of light poles and building exterior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Shimmy G.,"Lubbock, TX",26,70,164,3.0,12/15/2017,"You get what you pay for. And I mean that in the most unpretentious way possible. The bartenders remind me of my exes - they only want me when they want me. If they weren't in my face, they forgot all about me. And I'm convinced they switched wines on me...but I can't be certain because I was like 3 wines in but I'm almost positive they did. I ordered the ""healthy"" selection of salmon, sautéed spinach, and rice. My plate came out and the butter swishing around was like ""Heyyyy girl! Where you been?!"" I cannot tell a lie. I ate it. All of it. And it was so good. Because the butter makes it better right? Butter makes it Mo Better....except don't tell my BUTT that! Which is why I don't eat butter. (Once again, I'm trying hard to maybe pretentious.) But, you have no choice here. Eat the butter Anna Mae. This is definitely a place for the locals. It's like Cheers in a strip mall. I won't be back. Unless, well, like that ex - I have nothing else to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Shay P.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",0,7,5,3.0,11/13/2017,"14.99 specials have very small portions. Should at least have a side salad included or choice of appetizer. The food did taste good though so it's not the chefs fault. We went on a Sat night and it was bust so having to wait longer wasn't a huge issue but we did have a 20 min wait for our drinks. Got the Strawberry Mule drink, ehh. strong ginger taste...it did say it had ginger beer in it but IMO the blend of that with the sour agave didnt appeal to my taste. Go on a weekday for a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
Shelly J.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",336,181,801,2.0,3/12/2017,"10/100 The mall was insanely packed. The restaurants were full so we settled on Friday's. Bar wasn't full so we sat there. We ordered drinks to start. A few LTs and a mojito. LTs were weak. Usually one is enough for me before I'm out because I'm a lightweight. My mojito had something in it. I sent it back.  Manager apologized and said she would take care of it. I had it replaced and was told it on them.. ok cool.. My drink was sweet barely any alcohol. So  I just drank it.  We were watching the bartenders making drinks and they were so cheap with the liquor. Like a cosmo had a splash of alcohol. All the bottles were full.. and .... then there was our d bag of a bartender. Robert. Dude with the bushy pony tail. There were other choice words I wanted to use.  He made it priority to give patrons a hard time. From IDing everyone including some elderly folk. He turned away a whole party because they had out of state ids and just giving people a hard time the whole night.  I ordered quesadillas and let me tell you it was awful. My guac was almost brown and quesadilla was not tasty. I couldn't bare to snap a pic.  Robert never checked on us. I could have use some water.  Check took forever, this fool decided to ignore our requests. He made drinks,  checked ids, and giving ppl a hard time. Arguing with customers who had check issues and making new customers  leave. We asked again for the check and he got salty with my friend. I was ready to go ham.  Once check came I saw that i was still being charged for my mojito that was to be comped.. it Bartender was becoming more asinine, long story short manager took care of it and this fool argued with his boss and made a scene and had a two year old tantrum and stormed off. This was the worst Friday's . I get better treatment at Club Fridays in Greenbelt... The 2 stars are mostly for the managers because they did a great job handling mishaps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover

Rayanne D.,"Gambrills, MD",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,The service is getting worse than before .We just stopped by to get some drinks and appetizers. The restaurant wasn't busy at all . It took forever to get attended by our waitress. Every single time we looked for her we saw her standing around talking with her co workers. She gave us eye contact but didn't thought about to come over to check on us . I asked her to refill my water and she never came back . She went back to talk and laugh with the  staff. After 10min I asked a different waitress for my water and I she brought it to me in less than 2 min . Behind us was a table with two young guys and they told us they are having the same issues. If your priority is talking and having fun than you shouldn't work as a waitress!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover
D P.,"Baltimore, MD",0,5,11,1.0,7/23/2017,The Fridays is one of the worst I have experienced. The service was very slow. The greeters at the door didn't even speak or acknowledge us while standing waiting to be seated. The food was horrible. Ordered jack Daniels chicken and shrimp and they delivered the food without shrimp. None of the waiters stayed on the floor. It took 10-15 mins   Every request from the waiter.  The night manager has poor management skills and service. I see why the staff service is poor too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover

By then I'm like this dirty ass place but I'm there with my family so I ordered a well done steak it was opposite only thing that was good was fries so will I eat there again of course not, it was long wait of course and place was dirty food was greasy and they gave my cousin his food in frying pan they cooked his food in smh so it's gonna be a no for me.

Peter V.,"Hedgesville, WV",0,11,2,1.0,11/5/2017,I ordered the French Dip and it was really disgusting. I am not sure how you can make meat this greasy but Friday's has their own secret recipe. Do not order the French Dip. I used to order the Bacon Cheeseburger but the added cheese sauce to the burger and there is nothing more disgusting than cheese sauce. If you are too lazy to get some decent sliced cheese I will be eating somewhere else. The fries were cold as well.  That being said the service was decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover

Michele L.,"Brooklyn, MD",56,19,26,1.0,3/9/2017,"As long as I have been coming here. NEVER EVeR had a problem with service and food. Last Thursday, Husband and I came out to have dinner. I got $10 ribs, I got what I asked for. There were inedible, burnt and charred. Coleslaw dry! Husband burger sent back 4x, why? He ask for NO PICKLES and Onions. What is so hard? Then it was red.  So they made him well done burger. Comped it and gave us two coupons for a free appetizer or dessert. Now today, after Uber'in from Sterling, VA. I was so hungry.  I came into Arundel Mills. Like i always do. Been coming here since the opening. I sat at booth for ten minutes. No one approached me. Noticed just about every table with stools surrounding them was not clear of the dirty dishes. So I circled to the right of bar, noticed an employee left the dishwashing bin on one of the bar stool. Idk how long it was there. I sat down at the bar. I had to push dishes to the side. I said, ""Hello to the manager who was working that previous day"" she replied, ""we are so busy"". I mean that is understandable but standing there and not lifting up dishes from counter to transfer to the dish pan on the floor behind the counter. Only takes what 30 seconds. So I wanted to redeem my points I accidentally redeemed them asked for manager. Who happened to be someone I knew from old neighborhood. When she fixed my ticket, we caught up with life. And she didn't remove the dishes either. Some dishes were moved, but by the time my food arrived at 10:55pm. The rest still not removed. I ate half,asked for a box, did not tip. The bartender was standing in my face. Waiting for me to tip her or something. Just staring at me.  No, I was not. You standing there, you could have picked up soiled plates. Because I sat there and ate next to them my whole visit.  I took pictures! So I finally couldn't take it.....""How long is these dishes gonna be here?"". Just stared at me. Didn't say a word.

Timothy S.,"Norfolk, VA",0,34,10,2.0,6/3/2016,I don't mind the service here.  It's not winning awards but it's what you probably expect from a chain restaurant. The choices in preparing the food bother me.  Why is the grilled shrimp on the Caesar salad cooked yesterday and put in the fridge for today's salad?  Cold shrimp cooked yesterday isn't appetizing.

Heather C.,"Severn, MD",20,10,,2.0,11/19/2016,"I am only giving this 2 stars because we had decent service at a peak time (8 pm on a Saturday night), even though it took 30+ minutes to get in. The food was terrible and I could have made much better at home. We had some mozzarella sticks to start and they were not great and I've honestly had better from a frozen package at the store (which I'm sure this and all the food we had was frozen and prepackaged). I chose the chicken and shrimp cheese skillet with mashed potatoes and it was tiny, not deveined shrimp and two small pieces of bland grilled chicken on top of similarly bland cheese. The only good thing about it was the caramelized cheese on the skillet. The mashed potatoes, if you can call them that, were obviously instant potatoes. My husband had chicken pasta with the same small pieces of chicken and the pasta sauce tasted worse than Ragu from the store. To top it all off, the bill was $50 and we didn't even have alcoholic drinks.

If only I could be as positive about the service I received. It started with the unfriendly hostess who seemed to be bothered by our presence. After being seated, it was about 10 minutes until we were introduced to our server and asked for our drink choices. He was polite in taking our order but not very welcoming.

I tried a new drink I hadn't tried before, I can't recall what it was, but it was delicious. Joe makes great drinks!

Service was lackluster at best.  Our waitress (latina  with long brown hair) was inattentive and our first drinks didn't arrive at the table until after the food arrived.  What?!?!  The food served was not what we ordered and had to be returned to the kitchen several times.   When the correct food eventually reached our table, it was bland and tasteless.  Such a waste!  I reached out to the manager on duty and she even agreed the service we received wasn't the best.  She promptly comped a few items from the bill.  Needless to say, we won't return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=20

The waitress informed us she requested they remake them rather than bring them out to us; which we greatly appreciated.  Well.....after another long wait the ribs finally arrived. But much to our dismay....they too were burnt! Luckily we, the waitress, and the manager had a sense of humor and were able to laugh at the burnt bone fiasco.

When we got there we decided to sit at the booths near the bar. Our waitress seemed to be pleasant and we ordered drinks and food. My beer came in a short period of time and was cold so I was happy about that! I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp, my mom ordered an ahi tuna wrap but asked for it without kale and onions and my niece ordered Mac and cheese. We also ordered chicken potstickers as an appetizer and it came pretty quick. When the food arrived my moms wrap had the kale and onions she asked be removed being the kind person she is she just removed the onions and dealt with the kale. My food arrived and was absolutely horrible! The chicken was rubbery and had no flavor, and the shrimp looked like someone dumped salsa all over it not to mention it was chewy! The waitress wasn't mean but she wasn't very attentive. She walked over and asked how things were and kept walking past us as my mom was trying to respond. After that she was not seen again from till the check arrived! She did however stop to talk to a table of a group of guys for quite awhile. All in all my nieces Mac and cheese was the best item of food and for a check total of $50 this was not even remotely worth it! Given that there weren't many people there I would expect more attentive service! Not going back again! Which is sad because I've had so much better service before the remodel. *UPDATE* So against my better judgement I went again for a happy hour with some coworkers and not only was the tostado nachos horrible and disgusting after two bites but my friend had a fly in his amaretto sour....

Rizma W.,"Washington, DC",106,591,510,5.0,4/4/2016,"Andrew made our night! There were 10 of us celebrating my boyfriend's cousin's birthday. You can tell what a server is made of by how they handle big parties... you can almost smell the fear on some of them. Andrew was clearly no rookie, and seemed totally comfortable as our server. During the course of the night, there were a few missing items and other very minor missteps (which is to be expected when you have a large party, all ordering different things, not to mention the fact that many of did the endless apps thing and kept ordering different things each time), but he was cool and rolled with it like it was nothing. No excuses, just great service. He was extremely personable and made sure that we were all having a great time.  The cousin had brought in some cupcakes he ordered from a bakery, which they stored in the back for us to help make room at our table. He made sure that they brought out app plates and napkins, and evem wrote ""Don't Touch"" on the box so that other servers in the back wouldn't accidentally help themselves to them (good lookin out!). When we were done, he took the liberty of splitting our checks to avoid that post-dinner deficiency of basic math skills that people seem to experience every time they go to a group dinner and it is time to pay their portion of the bill. Everyone was able to settle up quickly and easily, and no one was forced to overpay to help cover the cost of something they did not order. That, in and of itself, was enough to make it a 5-star visit. The servers at this Friday's location all have these ipad-like devices where they can insert orders right at the table, as well as swipe a patron's credit card in front of them at the table (instead of disappearing with it and doing God-knows what with it).

Once seated it took 15+ minutes for our waitress to bring our water (two of us went to the restroom separately during this period and came back to still no water).  Oh and not to mention, our waitress had a trainee following her around that she alleged would be helping her out. Fast forward, we received our waters and other ordered  beverages however one of our orders was completely wrong. Somehow one of entrees was confused with a appetizer. When we told the fella who brought out our food that the entree was wrong, he asked us who our waiter was. Ummm, you work here and we don't. Can you please figure out the name of your colleague and figure out the mishap behind the scenes? Or did you want is to take the entree back to the cook ourselves and have it corrected? Once that issue was resolved, the strange fella brought out the corrected meal but our waitress and her trainee never rolled back around to ask if it was resolved or refill any of our drinks.

I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta dinner and it was very good. Their happy hour is not that great but for this area a $6 Margarita is apparently a good deal.  I defiantly recommend the Cajun pasta. The flavors are not over powering and go great with a good beer or wine, not so much with a Margarita. The dish is like a Fettuccine Alfredo meal without the heaviness. Also don't be afraid about the Cajun because its not spicy, the Cajun is just seasoning that adds the flavor. Good luck with trying to order dessert after this meal, you won't feel fat but you will feel full. As a side note don't order the Oreo Madness because it's a huge rip-off. $6 for an Oreo ice cream sandwich on a plate with a half a slice of strawberry and some chocolate and caramel sauce on the plate. Nothing special or creative.     Last, the customer service at this location is good at the bar. I have yet to eat at the regular dinning area to comment on that area.

I would have left and ventured elsewhere but my dinner companions chose to tough it out. I wasn't paying and would not have for poor quality food and bad service.  Such a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=80

I mean, seriously, for $12 you have 4 different dishes that you can share and be completely satisfied.  We've tried a lot of the other dishes here and haven't been disappointed. Their Cajun Pasta is awesome. Would also recommend the Jack Daniel's Sampler and the Jack Daniel's Burger.  Make sure to sign up to be a Stripes member!

SD M.,"Ashburn, VA",0,36,17,2.0,6/12/2015,"Came to this area for lacrosse tournament. Looking for a place to eat without wait on a Friday night around 6:45. No wait here so we decided to stay. Me and my twin 12 year old boys each got a soda. Spinach flatbread as appt. ( turned out it happened to be a $5 appt special ) it was just ok, bland and soggy...nothing to rave about. Honestly it isn't worth more than $5, def not $8.99 which is the regular price. One son got a MR done steak and rib with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Steak came all brown and well done chewy and tough which we sent back and after waiting for a good while, finally replace with a MR steak, but it was still a bit chewy. Steak just wasn't the best quality.  My other son got shrimp and chicken Cajun pasta. It was just okay, not well seasoned. Pretty bland.  I got French onion soup and Cobb salad with balsamic dressing on the side. The French onion soup was the worst French onion soup I have ever tasted, the soup was incredibly salty, it was so dense and thick like a can of condensed soup as is. Hard to swallow. If you are going to serve canned soup, at least add some liquid to dilute it !!! Salad was fine, can't really mess up a Cobb salad. For 3 of us it was $70. I will gladly pay more for good food.

Usually we get a table but I was so hungry I didn't feel like waiting. First time sitting at the bar. For it to be a FULL bar I didn't wait long at all to be noticed. Bartender Ashley is a rock star. She was busy and still made us feel like we were the only ones there. Makes a hell of a Long Island. The other bartenders checked up on us too from time to time. BBQ wings were SO GOOD.

Despite 3 people being at the hostess stand. The hostess, a server and the manager. The manager must have been giving instructions or something but you have to lead by example. If you, as a manager, show no interest in the clients then how can your staff?  so I had a 35 minute wait at 11pm on a Friday. No biggie. I come in to get the table after time is up  and the hostess offers the seat yourself option to a group of ladies before us. Ok. Again, no big deal because I'm about to be seated anyway. Wrong. She leads us to a narrow dining area kind of away from everyone else. Dirty floor. Water on the chair. Gross. I told her there's water on the chair. She just looked at me. Ok so this is going nowhere. I asked her if the bar is self seating and yes at the bar itself and the hightops. Would have been nice to be offered that when you said there was a 35 minute wait. Our server, I forget his name, was great! The food situation though...we did the endless apps. There were only 2 of us. The first round took about 30 minutes to come out. I was annoyed but patient. When it did come, it looked like it had been sitting under a lamp for ages. Second round took 22 minutes. I timed it. One of the apps came out wrong. Not wrong because we customized it-we ordered the item as is....and they sent it out with ingredients missing. That's what did it for me.

Kate M.,"Washington, DC",0,27,,5.0,3/23/2017,"What has delicious food? What has paper for kids to color on? Where can you go to get ribs? Is it Applebees? No! It's Fridays! Fridays is located in Washington, D.C. If you go to Fridays you should get strawberry soda with chicken strips. You could also get a slushie with two hamburgers. In my opinion, Fridays is the best place to eat. First, they give you endless appetizers. Second, some of the meals are free because there isn't that much food on your plate. Lastly, if you want to invite your friends and family to a restaurant Fridays is the best place. I suggest you go to Fridays. Some may argue that DCity Smokehouse is better than Fridays but I disagree. Fridays is off the hook! If you want to get steak and ribs go to Fridays. Second if you want to get slushies go to Fridays.

Our server's name was Sean and he was less than attentive to our needs. We had to ask for a refill on our drinks and I asked him twice for a side of sour cream.

We waited 20 minutes for our first round of beers and didn't see the server again for 30 minutes but when we did see her she would sit down while taking our order. She also never cleared plates from our table; we had ordered about 20 appetizers. Meanwhile, the bartender was screaming at and egging on drunk patrons at the bar.

Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",357,1748,2174,2.0,8/26/2015,"Bottom Line: Bar food which would be tolerable if the service wasn't dismal. I'm generally not a big fan of chain restaurants (Cheesecake Factory and a few others being exceptions) but the Arundel Mills area is peppered with chain restaurants and there was a group decision to get a bite to eat here absent much better choices.  My experience at this Friday's is certainly a reminder of why I haven't eaten at this chain in a decade.  In the spirit of fairness, let's note a few positive items about this restaurant: - Ample parking - Hip interior - Large menu with lots of bar food options - A handful of items are always on happy hour special at great prices - Friendly and professional hostess - Thrifty options for big appetites especially with promotions like endless appetizers. The food here is about what one would expect from an American chain restaurant and bar - burgers, fires, pasta, glutinous appetizers, rich desserts, etc.  When I was 20 I loved all of these dishes and could metabolize them like a champ.  But fast forward many years, and I'm now seeking more unique dishes in less corny atmospheres. The biggest struggle at this Friday's was the service.  It was unanimous at my table of six that service was lacking. Specific issues with the service included the following: - Server's underwear hanging out of the waist of his pants.  Unsightly. - Wrong drinks delivered on two occasions for which we were fully charged. - Only five menus were provided for six people, a sixth menu was never brought out despite asking. - I ordered an appetizer for my entree and was told it would come out first since it was technically an appetizer which I thought was lame but I didn't protest.  In the end, my appetizer was delivered after all of the main courses. I think appetizers should be delivered before main courses unless otherwise requested by the diner.   - Getting condiments was tough.  In some cases they'd been requested when placing orders and we still couldn't get them without asking multiple times.  - Our waiter didn't write anything down which would have been fine if he could remember what we ordered without coming back to check the details.  Additionally, our check was wrong so we ended up writing what we had ordered down for him. Another area of concern is that there was a lot of water being tracked from behind the bar to the restaurant floor.  This made for a treacherous trip to some tables and the bathrooms.  When a restaurant is this messy (and dangerous) in plain sight it really makes me question how it's managed in general.  Diner be aware.  Two stars is probably a bit generous for this restaurant but I always like to give businesses the benefit of the doubt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=40

I point to the empty area on the other side of our section, almost totally open area with part booth part chairs. hostess disappears for another 5 minutes. I'm not kidding!!! she comes back and says there are 2 tables, one right by the door and one on the other side of the restaurant. I opt for the one actually in a dining area and the hostess just stands there blocking the way from where we were. we stood there for a good 3 minutes before I just charged past her since she obviously wasn't going to seat us. when we sat down, we ordered our drinks and an app... I got the steak tacos and a blackberry Long Island iced tea... the tacos were served with plain white rice, not sure what their purpose was? my first bite of the taco was gristley, fatty, unchewable meat that tasted like I bit into a flower bouquet... surely that's not what I'm paying $12 for!! so I took another bite of just the meat and again, FLOWERS!! no I'm not kidding! it was so inedible. my friend got the buffalo chicken bites and a strawberry daiquiri, she was kinda shoving them around too. our drinks... omg the drinks... and I swear, I SWEAR I'm not kidding!! my LI iced tea was like shoving a straw into a bottle of vodka. my friend's daiquiri was half melted when it came to the table and just as strong! our waitress, who we almost never saw, comes by and sees I'm not eating my tacos, and asks how they are. I NEVER return ANYTHING! I asked if I could have the same as my friend. I love buffalo chicken bites, you can't go wrong! ohhhh they did... and I understand why she was just playing with hers... they were so SALTY... it was like eating a saucey, spicey cube of tofu that was breaded with rock salt. the best thing we had was our plate of fries we ordered for my friend's toddler, and the ""nachos"" we had as our app which was only a crispy tortilla smeared with refried beans and melted cheese topped with a single jalapeño chip...  my friend asked for another sprite and she never got it.... we'll NEVER go back there. bad service.

keith c.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",10,14,4,3.0,3/31/2011,I work really late hours so my co-workers and I often eat here because they are one of the few places with decent food that's open late around here. The food is about on par with any other friday's but the service is hit or miss. Some times it is ok and other times you can't even get them to split the check or refill the drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140
Patricia B.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,3,,3.0,10/28/2013,"We have dined here several times prior to renovations, so we looked forward to seeing the new renovations. However, we left disappointed. The service was prompt and the new atmosphere was nice. My problem was the food. I ordered the Jack Daniel's ribeye (asked for Medium Rare) & shrimp scampi. My steak came out medium well and was under seasoned. Thank goodness for the sauce! The shrimp scampi didn't excite, but with no steak on my plate the shrimp sufficed. The new steak came out close to medium rare but again no seasoning. The sweet potato fries were limp and could of used salt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140
Tom D.,"Pasadena, MD",0,5,,1.0,12/7/2013,Worst dining experience I have ever had. Our waitress (Crystal I believe) was terrible. She was disrespectful and acted like we were interrupting her when she came to take our order etc. Every time she came over she would not say a word and would just stare at us until we said something. The noise level was terrible: music blaring to the point where you could feel the bass in your seat. I will never be going back to this Fridays again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140
Louis G.,"Elkridge, MD",5,11,2,4.0,5/9/2010,"I regularly go into this TGI Fridays.  I wish they had more room in the bar, always a tight squeeze and you have to show up at 4pm to get a table.  The food is decent, and no better/less then any other TGI around the country.  The service has always been par.  Never had an awesome server, but never a bad experience either.  LOVE THE MUD SLIDES, and the Mojito is HORRIBLE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140
Clarence P.,"Accokeek, MD",0,53,,3.0,7/1/2012,Had a quick meal on the way to the airport.   Typical chain food...middle of the road.... Had better than average service. Manager walked around checking on service.  Very friendly server and staff. Service should be a 4 star...but being a chain they are required to serve food as directed by the office.  You will never get good food when directed by a corporate lawyer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140
Yaul R. S.,"Chicago, IL",0,16,,3.0,12/23/2011,I ate here for the first time in about 10 years.  I now have new insight into why Americans are so fat.   Even the breadsticks are fried!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140
Robin Diane B.,"Rockville, MD",0,3,,1.0,4/20/2010,"I have never in my life had worse service at a Friday's. The drinks were beyond terrible, as was the service. I refused to drink what was served to me and was told it would not be comped. ( 2 $8 drinks), I spoke to the manager Christine Tokney (she would not spell her name for me, this is my best guess) who was both rude and aggressive and when I asked for a pen to write down her name and a number I could contact she refused and walked away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=140
Austin M.,"Tysons, VA",234,412,233,1.0,9/5/2011,"This location is extremely poorly managed.  We sat for thirty minutes after  coming in and being seated for a server to even acknowledge us-and the place wasn't that busy! The restaurant also appeared to be very dirty, and the restroom resembled a paper towel garbage dump. The small crowd that was there seemed to be a little iffy also.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
Steven D.,"Fort Meade, MD",5,327,10,4.0,6/12/2014,"I had always love the food from Friday's.  I recommend ordering the Tostados Nachos, the Jack Daniel's Ribs or Burgers, and the Crispy Green Bean Fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
Jason P.,"Dallas, TX",1,41,,3.0,8/16/2012,"it's Fridays so good as usual but wouldn't say great.  Plenty of TV's but not exactly the best setup so you have to find the TV with your game on it and then find a seat with a view.  You won't be able to watch multiple games from most seats in the bar.   If you don't want to fight the parking at Arundel Mills mall, then this is probably the closest alternative that I would select.  It's a safe choice for eating out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
Darius D.,"Annandale, VA",326,91,223,3.0,11/10/2013,Its just your normal TGI Fridays. The atmosphere was very live though because they had a remodel of the bar area.  Whenever I go to Fridays I order something off the Jack Daniels list.

Edward L.,"Columbia, MD",65,177,32,3.0,12/7/2011,"It's like any other TGI Fridays I've been to.  The food is average casual restaurant food.  The servers are great though.  The last two times we came were with our volleyball teams on a Wednesday night.  Since there were 20 of us, they set us up in the party room.  Even with all the people in our group, they were spot-on with our orders other than forgetting a few waters. The bar seems to be a happening place with the loud music and happy people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
Jordan K.,"Glen Burnie, MD",341,531,436,3.0,10/24/2011,This place can be hit or miss on the service/food quality depending on the time of day you get here.  If you beat the rush you have a better chance on getting decent service.  I have ate here a few times on various times and have experienced a roller coaster of service/quality.  Good thing is that you I get coupons online and use those or extra savings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
Kenneth L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,86,,4.0,4/17/2013,I was really impressed by this very TGI Fridays. Service was excellent and they really improved in what they have to offer. I got one of their deals of an appetizer and an entry for 15 bucks! The appetizer can out fast and it was delicious! The entree that consisted of Salmon was cooked perfectly. I will be going back to this TGI Fridays very soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
Tomasa R.,"Dallas, TX",53,130,108,3.0,9/18/2013,The hot wings and The Jack Daniels Sampler are my FAV!! I didn't like how the staff kept picking on one of the severs after she asked them to stop repeatedly they just laughed. Other than that I had a good time with the ladies.

Xavier K.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,2,,1.0,3/21/2013,I have a friend that was a manager there and he quit because they don't wear gloves in the kitchen when preparing food. .. they use expired product. .. they don't make things to recipe. .. note do they wash their  hands... and they have roaches. ... he got tired of apologizing top guest about becoming sick. ... don't go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120

James B.,"Miramar, FL",0,32,44,4.0,1/22/2015,Great place for happy hour after a long day at work. They have good deals on drinks during the week. Beware it can get pretty pack at times. Food is decent and the service is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
Melanie W.,"Laurel, MD",27,43,18,4.0,5/1/2013,"I have to admit, this is the cleanest TGI Fridays I have ever been in. Every time I go inside (at least, during the day) I get good, fast service. I am not usually an ubber fan of places such as TGI Fridays, but I can say I have fallen in love with the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp.

Melody C.,"Millersville, MD",294,244,,3.0,7/26/2011,"I like the food at Fridays a lot. The service isn't incredibly consistent but definitely won't ruin your experience. Our waiter was good about bringing us drinks refills (I think they were free?) but not too attentive about anything else. My friend was arriving late so we were sitting waiting, and just thought he forgot about us since he didn't ask if we were ready to order. But as soon as she arrived he was there asking for her drink order. So I realized he was probably just waiting for her, so we could all order together. Understandable.  It looks like they have more staff than they need, but it probably does get really busy at certain times of day. It's nice how they open the doors and greet you on your way in and out. I'm a big fan of their chicken tenders and potatoes so I'd probably go back either way. The strawberry lemonade is good but not the best lemonade I've had (I loooove lemonade), I'd probably just go with a water & lemon next time. Solid 3 stars for a good chain restaurant with decent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hanover?start=120
