Archie A.,"Coronado, CA",338,378,1346,4.0,8/11/2017,Not bad for a food option for the area. Walking distance from our hotel.  No seating wait during our visit on a Monday night. Costumer service was friendly and attentive. For dinner we enjoyed the half off on Apps and posted pictures of what we ordered... Really good experience. Seems like a local hang out spot and the conversations at the bar seem a little conservative.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Brandy D.,"Leawood, KS",0,26,1,5.0,7/23/2017,"Whoa! Best Applebee's I've been to in years. Our server was attentive and friendly, actually, all of the employees were friendly.  Very happy with the food. The lettuce was cold and the meat was warm. Couldn't ask for more.  Great service and great food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Joshua M.,"Boscobel, WI",46,5,,3.0,11/19/2017,"The Service was WONDERFUL. Driving though from Denver and had dinner here. The food wasn't that great actually, that's why I gave it 3 stars. But the servers were wonderful, and the place was clean and inviting. They even have the greater open the door for you. I would recommend if the food was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Robert V.,"St. Petersburg, FL",45,149,7,5.0,7/27/2017,"Paige, our waitress was utterly SUPERB! First, she found a hidden stash of Chivas Regal which made my evening (I had just run over a curb in getting to the restaurant and was still a little JUMPY!). Two double scotches, a nice batch of onion rings for an appetizer, the caprese mozzarella chicken for me and the three-cheese chicken cavatappi for my wife completed an excellent meal with excellent service. Doubt that we will ever be back through this location, but this visit was SPOT ON!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Stuart S.,"St. Claude, New Orleans, LA",111,2,,5.0,9/28/2017,"BEST APPLEBEE'S FOREVER. Traveling through Hays, sat at the bar and ate all the food. Bartender was amaze. I'm a big fan of all the Applebee's, but the one in Hays is legit. Ordered desert to go and by the time I got to the motel across the street the chocolate lava cake had some how gotten hotter and tastier. Listened to some classics like Seal's kissed by a rose and left feeling like my life actually amounted to something. All of the employees deserve a raise. Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
General Cornwallis M.,"Saint Louis, MO",43,34,8,1.0,3/14/2017,"More like Crapple-Bees. For most a dining out experience at AppleBee's is never a first choice and like most there was no exception here. However the horrendousness of the food at AppleBee's is something that words will fall short to capture but I'll try my upmost.  My friend and I ordered salads thinking the bar for screwing up a salad is pretty low and one of those items that a chimpanzee with severe brain trauma could do correctly. Oh how I would have preferred the brain-injured chimp to the ""cooks"" that prepared our salads.  We ordered their ""southwest salads"" and they clearly crossed into the menu illegally and should be swiftly deported back south whence they came.  AppleBee's menu does what can only be described as ""Catfishing"" where you see pictures of something beautiful and then when your presented with the real deal it differs vastly for the worse from what you thought you'd be getting.  The salads were bathing in dressing, where lettuce was floating on a medium sized puddle. The dressing was supposed to be ranch but was vinaigrette, it had the texture of an inflamed large pimple with clear viscous fluid followed quickly by thick creamy white puss, and tasted like such. The ""meat"" was as warm as pocket lint and tasted about the same with almost no flavor and chewy texture that clearly screamed Microwaved. On top of our microwaved pucks of meat there was a green pile of shavings of what tasted vaguely like lime and sawdust, something that should line the floors of a hamster cage not rest upon human food. The animals that gave their lives for this salad did so in vain. I hope their sacrifice in this review will steer you clear of ever entering this AppleBee's in Hays Kansas.  The ONLY way this Crapple-Bee's is getting anything past a 1 star review is by PAID reviewers, I checked out some of the ""5 star"" ratings here and there by people that only review franchises and chains, sketchy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Correy O.,"San Diego, CA",20,161,16,3.0,2/9/2016,"One of the only GF options in Hays, KS for me while on business. I had the Ribs Platter (smaller version of the sampler) with Fries. All of their fries & BBQ sauces for the ribs are all Gluten Free & Dairy Free.  It's Applebees's so you can't have high expectations of the food, but it was as good as their food can be. The best part about this place is the service. Spencer was our waiter and he was awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Pat C.,"Littleton, CO",10,11,5,5.0,6/15/2017,"I dropped in this Applebees, I have not been to Applebees for several years.  I am in Hays on business.  I ordered take out, They had it ready to go in less then 10 min.  Great services, yummy food.

Adam H.,"Claremont, CA",0,1,2,1.0,4/14/2016,"After a long, arduous day of travel, I was incredibly hungry, exhausted and content to consume anything that even slightly resembled food. Then, Applebee's happened... This establishment is the essence of what is wrong with the food industry in the United States of America. My meal was clearly prepared in a microwave and even then, somehow was cold. Macaroni and Cheese seems like a food item that would generally be easy to not completely screw up; however, I was blown away by how unappetizing it truly was. The hygiene in this establishment was also atrocious and I will be genuinely surprised if I contract no food-borne illness after this experience.  To summarize: Only eat here if you are truly desperate and out of options, and please seriously consider the Long John Silvers down the street...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3

Greg M.,"Westminster, CO",4,53,9,2.0,10/26/2014,"Sunday dinner, the place was moderately busy.  Service was OK, but not good enough to get a refill on my tea.  Food was marginal to acceptable.   French Onion soup was a bit on the bland side. Grilled Chicken Ciabatta sandwich left a lot to be desired. The chicken was a bit over cooked but tasted OK, the Artichoke spread stuff had no taste.    My father had the Salmon and it was burned on the bottom. His spinach veggi mix was disgusting.  It looked like someone thawed out some frozen spinach and tossed it on the plate with some peas.  I do know they were having some issues in the kitchen tonight. I walked by and heard someone getting after someone else for not doing something right.  Lots of other places to eat if you are in a hurry passing through.  I've been coming to this area for 18+ years.  I would have done much better going across the street to Los Dos Oros Gold. Very good trad Mex food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Beverly T.,"Jackson, MO",1,14,4,3.0,8/25/2016,"We must have visited on a very confusing day. The wait staff seemed unsure of even the simplest of task starting with the hostess that seated us. Everyone was nice enough but the experience was not the best. I had to ask for a new salad since my first offering was mainly brown chunks of white something. Then our bill was incorrect and it took a while to get it straightened out.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I believe they are training new wait staff and may be training kitchen staff also",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Myron H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",91,36,72,2.0,6/24/2016,The service was slow. We had to ask for our salad after they brought our food. My fries seemed like they were sitting for a while.

Ryan P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",93,321,271,3.0,6/19/2015,"Stopped here heading west. Servers were friendly, although a little unprofessional. Ordered some nachos which were pretty bad -- had to ask for some salsa to put on them after the fact because they were so dry and hardly had anything on them. Mostly just a pile of chips with some cabbage and pork. Still, the place was clean enough and I'm sure some of their other food is better (?).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3

C F.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3,58,27,1.0,9/21/2015,"Well as usual, every time I walk into an Applebee's , I get overwhelmed by a nasty mold, old wet garbage smell and this one is no different. Front door was dirty, greasy and it gives a bad impression from the start came in for lunch, I sat at bar, and Lisa the bartender was an older lady with no customer service what so ever. Lisa, you need a new job! Employees eating in bar area, then running to serve food after licking her fingers? Gross!! Bathroom was disgusting, gave me thoughts of Texas and Oklahoma. I'm writing off Applebee's all together. Same across many states.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Teresa T.,"Colby, KS",2,68,,5.0,9/12/2015,"I am appalled at all the negative ratings for this very fine, affordable restaurant. My husband and I had lunch here last Thursday (9/10/2015) and were greeted immediately and pleasantly by two of the female wait staff. We were seated immediately by a window and our appetizer came out in a very timely manner. We ordered off the 2 for 1 menu and were completely satisfied with our meals. Our server, Andria, was terrific, friendly and efficient. She came by to see if we needed/wanted anything more several times. My husband had the steak and she suggested he cut into it to be certain it was medium as he'd ordered. I had the chicken, shrimp, mushroom combo and we both agreed they were delicious, hot and fresh. Also, the manager, Tony, came by to check on us, and other patrons. All in all, a very professional establishment. We will be back whenever we visit Hays again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Aaron G.,"Omaha, NE",20,32,32,1.0,11/18/2014,Horrible experience there last night. We went there for a beer around 9 pm. Sara P. was our waitress. She has a HORRIBLE attitude. Crabby and downright rude. We asked for a manager and she refused to get us one. We were at the bar and she didn't belong there with that attitude. Our tab was $10.12 and I left her a $20 tip to help her change her attitude. I'll never go there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3

Josh C.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,1.0,5/20/2016,"If your not a local you probably won't be treated well.  I stopped in for dinner, as I was staying in Hays for the night while traveling.  Sat at the bar, ordered a cocktail, and got precisely one shot of whisky measured in a jigger while the bartender openly free poured for people she seemed to know. Ordered a steak medium-rare and was not given a steak knife, only managed to get one after trying to make eye contact with the bartender for what seemed like an eternity (bar was nearly empty).  I probably wouldn't have even bothered had my steak been cooked properly, but being that it was well done and tough as leather there was no way I was getting through it with the butter knife I was given. Bartender never bothered to ask how my steak (or any of my food/drinks for that matter) was.  After suffering through my food, I waited over 4 minutes (yes I timed it this time) with an empty glass and clean plate for my bill, while the bartender talked to coworkers, filled the ice machine, and warmly greeted some guy she knew that showed up at the bar.  If you are an Applebee's regular in Hays, KS I pity you, but feel honored that you are among a select few who recieve acceptable service at this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3
Nick L.,"San Mateo, CA",82,1025,13,4.0,1/15/2013,"Admittedly this is not a type of restaurant we'd go too often, one because it's not near where we live and two, it's not near where we live. We stopped off to get gas on our drive from Chitown to SF and as it was lunch time, we stopped off to get some food. There were a few restaurants/dining options but not wanting to overdose on fast food and have a sit down meal, this seemed like a good spot. Our waitress and hostess were both smiling and friendly which makes a remarkable difference to some places where they are downright gruffy. The food was par for the course, no Michelin stars but exactly what we wanted.

The service was bad.  The waitress gave the check in the middle of our lunch (worst than Chinese restaurant,  at least they gave when we doing our dessert).  She came back after few minutes,  asking if the check ready for her (really???

Monica V.,"Tribune, KS",1,2,,3.0,2/28/2015,"We came to Hays for State wrestling, so we figured they would be pretty busy. Our wait was actually not long at all, 3 minutes tops. We had a kind waitress. My boyfriend ordered the fish and fries -- my sister ordered the 9 oz sirloin, Medium, with mashed potatoes -- I ordered a shrimp and sirloin parmesan steak, Medium, with a baked potato. The food didn't take long to come out, but my sister and I's steak were way underdone. We had to wait approx 15 minutes before the waitress came back to ask how the food was. I told her that both our steaks were way underdone, so she took them back to get new ones. The wait for those steaks were longer, probably due to the fact that they were packed by that time. The manager brought two new fresh plates and the steaks were cooked correctly. When I went to pay for the tab, I had seen that the steaks were not charged to our tab, which is something I was going to discuss with the manager anyway. I don't think we will be back to that Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3?start=20
Ryan H.,"Lakewood, CO",91,113,22,1.0,6/22/2014,"Poor service, under cooked food, and simple requests that can't be made. Not to mention my server let me in a tip that has just ruined Applebee's for me forever. I asked for no red peppers on my dish and he told me they couldn't do it because it comes prepackaged... Umm what? I might as well go over to Walmart across the way and go get a prepackaged freezer meal and take it home. However I'm not surprised because there veggies are never crunchy anyways so I'm assuming that they are frozen too. Also two times I have had undercooked burgers from here. Once, they middle was still frozen. Are you serious? I would not recommend going here. Try something local or what's left of local. If you are passing through, go to Gellas!

Jamie S.,"Hays, KS",5,3,,2.0,11/19/2014,"I have never had a bad experience dining in the store. However, their car side service, or to go service, is very dissatisfying. It took more than 10 minutes to place my order via phone because the website does not allow customization on their food options, such as no tomatoes. After the ordeal of being on the phone, they gave me the wrong total. I went to the store to pick up my food and waited five minutes outside in my vehicle. No one came to greet me so I went inside. I stood inside for another 5 minutes before anyone bothered to say anything to me. Upon receiving my food, it was made incorrectly so I did not take the food home. Upon calling later to complain, the manager (Tom) handled my situation poorly. He was very rude on the phone. He offered to remake the food properly. My boyfriend went and picked up the food and brought it home, free of charge. However, the food was still made wrong. The food was good, which is the only reason this got 2 stars. I would give it a 2.5 but yelp won't let me. The hospitality and service is severely lacking with this applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hays-3?start=20
Austin A.,"Washington, DC",0,27,17,1.0,10/3/2012,"Arrogant, obnoxious staff make this restaurant unpleasant. It is unfortunate because it is the only decent chain, besides ihop in this town.  I went with friends and tried to order my usual menu items and they had changed them. The food was not up to regular Applebee's standards (and I have eaten in this chain in five states), when pointing this out to staff they were insolent to the point where my colleagues (there were four of us on a business dinner) decided not to go there again. I like a chain if they are consistent with their food and have decent service (they do not even have to be great, just average), but this killed it for me. The manager was ineffective and had to be called twice and it took half an hour to get him to come out of his office (after staff tried to use another waitstaff and say they were the manager).
