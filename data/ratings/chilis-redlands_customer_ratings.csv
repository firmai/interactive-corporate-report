135,Mourad L.,"Redlands, CA",0,8,,1.0,2012-02-13,"Went there last night. Service was good, no waiting to get a table but the food was awful. I ordered their ""new"" 6Oz steak. It comes with broccolis and mashed potatoes. How bad can you mess this? The meat was watery. I thing they just pulled it from the freezer and put it on the grill. It had no taste, no seasoning. Patties from MacDonald had more taste than that steak. Broccolis were just plain. No seasoning just steamed broccolis. The mashed potatoes were decent. The cheese on top was not melted but it was the tastier element on my plate.

Nobody even made eye contact or acknowledged us for that whole period of time. Just as we were about to give up and leave the waitress runs up and seats us.  When we were finally seated we ordered quickly and our appetizer came without issue. However, after we finished the appetizer we had to wait for over 30 minutes for our entree... and during that time we received exactly zero refills. We were told we were being served by a waiting team but I never saw the the waiter our waitress was supposedly paired with. Before the entree came a busboy came up and took our plate then told us to pay whenever we wanted. At this point we hadn't received our entree yet and here he thought we were DONE and ready to leave. Probably because we'd just been sitting there doing nothing but waiting for so long. The food was alright when it finally came but it took way too long! I didn't even get to take my leftovers with me because we had to go pick someone up and I wasn't willing to wait who knows how long to get a container. At least they have those tablets you can pay with at the table, or we would have been waiting another 30 minutes to pay the bill. I would NOT recommend going here. The staff shows very little consideration or care and we will not be coming here again. I'll just drive over to the Chili's on hospitality if I want to eat at one again... though after that experience I don't think I'll want to for some time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=100,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.308,2.72

Ended up having to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to order our food then waited an additional 45/60 minutes for the food to come out. Friend ordered a beer and was brought the completely wrong brand. Drinks were refilled once out during the 2 1/2 hours we were there. Finally we were able to get our waitresses attention (she was talking to friends the whole time) we all handed her our cards and she decided that that was just for fun because she charged my card twice and some cards not at all.

My friend got a kids grilled chicken that looked like it had been picked off a buffet platter. So dry the kid could barely eat it. My enchiladas were also crunchy from sitting under a heat lamp.

Because I wear  braces, making many foods difficult to chew, I've been ordering--for many, many weeks now-- the chicken enchiladas and asking them to sub shrimp.No problem. A $2 upcharge and everyone was happy. Until today. Today, the waitress couldn't figure out a way to do the simple upcharge, and wanted to charge me for a side of shrimp--6 shrimp for 2.99. That's 2 shrimp per enchilada. I escalated to management, got the same response. No effort to make the customer happy, in any way. We canceled the other order, paid for my iced tea and walked out.

We asked for a discount, not even a comp or free app just a ten percent discount we asked because it was a whole hour. The manager comes out, and starts interrogating us about how long we took to order, he explained that it may have seemed like an hour because maybe we ordered drinks or maybe we needed more time to look at the menu (he was making it seem like we racked up the time), he said but it really 45 minutes according to the ticket and not an hour (fine) and that 45 minutes for a friday night wasn't too bad. We said well why is the waitress apologizing ""for the wait"" if its normal, we dine out all the time and never wait for food that long. he did the discount and said we could pay on the screen, we had been planning on getting a dessert but he didn't even ask us. So we just paid and left. The service was good, food good but not even an apology from the manager.  lThis place has really gone down hill.We were seated,  no one told us about the three course special.

After we received our dinner and after we paid our bill, I requested to speak with the manager, Jerry, to express our concern with waiting so long for our food. Jerry immediately told me that our ticket only took 20 minutes to finish which was a lie. I showed Jerry my text message when we were called to our table (9:27pm) and when we got our food (10:32pm). I gave them about 15 minutes to get our drinks and take our entree orders which I thought was fair. All I asked of Jerry was for him to hear my concern and instead he argued with me about the wait time after I showed him the text message again. I was not looking for a gift card or free meal, I just wanted a simple apology or at least for them to take ownership of their mistake. Unfortunately, it hurts me but I will not be back.

I like the food here.  It isn't awe inspiring, but the menu is huge and there is a lot of variety, so you should be able to find something you like.  I ended up with the 'upscale' taco plate, and it is tasty and relatively healthy, plus not too expensive.  I also had a couple of margaritas, which I like here quite a bit.  In fact, long ago I adopted the Presidente style (with brandy) as my home margarita style.  Service was very friendly (apart from the missing bartender) so I have no complaints about the waitress. If you go with a group, the on-table payment system makes splitting a check really easy.  You just opt to split it, and then each person ticks off what they ordered and then swipes a CC and puts in a tip.  The waitress does not have to track charges, and there is no arguing over who owes what or trying to tell the waitress put X on this CC, Y on this CC and Z on the last one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands,2.88,2.82,2.82,,2.844
41,Julian M.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,10,,1.0,2017-07-26,"Very bad experience with this restaurant. We visiting the restaurant on 7/26/17. We were seated all was good. The waitress was very polite. We sat down, and ordered. About 30 minutes in, we still had not received our order. When we finally did, the order was wrong. We asked for one of the plates to be corrected  (allergic to onions) and it took another 15 minutes to get it back. When we asked why it took so long, they stated they were backed up. The thing is, 2 parties of 6 or more came and sat after us and they received their food long before us. I was excited to try this place out. Very disappointed. Food was good, service was pretty bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=40,2.72,2.82,2.82,,2.7800000000000002

51,Lisa T.,"Redlands, CA",102,2,,1.0,2017-09-23,"Went in for a small little celebratory meal for my son passing his driving test, nothing major just wanted a quick bite and this location is close to home. We arrived and waited about 20 min to be seated. My husband ordered a cup of chili and was told that they had been out of chili since noon. Really? How do you run out of something and not remake or do what you have to do before the dinner crowd to ensure that one of your biggest sellers (in the name) is available. He made another choice, we waited about 35-40 min for our food before finally asking why it was taking so long. As soon as we asked our food was delivered in less than a minute. It had been sitting in the window and was pretty much room temp when it arrived to the table. We are because we were hungry but we won't be back. The manager nicely comped 10% off of our bill, but I would have rather had hot food and paid full price which is what's expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=40,2.8,2.87,2.87,,2.8419999999999996

Our server, Buffy, was incredibly inattentive. She didn't get our orders correct nor did she feel the need to check on our table to see how we were doing or if we needed anything...like waters refilled or napkins etc. Needless to say we will not return. Food was not fresh or tasty as it had been in the past. Over cooked rubbery shrimp fajitas, over cooked chicken crispers, undercooked broccoli, over procecessed chicken breast. Its a shame that Chili's is losing our business because I had been a regular customer with my children for the past three years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands,2.68,2.81,2.81,,2.758
8,Micheal A.,"Highland, CA",224,3,,1.0,2017-12-05,"My experience at chili's was.completely unacceptable. The waitress was forcing a smile that made my boyfriend and I feel so sorry for her.  According to our receipt her name is Jax. I had ordered the bottomless soup and salad, which is supposed to mean I can get as much as i can eat. They where out of the loaded potatoe soup, so she said my options where the chili soup and tortilla soup. I had notice that on the menu it was 80 cents extra and she did not mention that untii i brought it up.  Then she brought out my soup and salad and I had asked for a second bowl of soup since she constantly walked by without asking. I had not touched the salad yet and she had the nerve to say that I did ""better than most"". When my boyfriend asked what she meant, she said that usually people don't get more than one bowl of soup. Too make a woman feel insecure, especially in front of my boyfriend,  is despicable. By the way, they are budgeting on napkins so be sure to bring your own!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands,2.68,2.8,2.8,,2.7520000000000002

Seriously the staff was rude the vibe wasn't cool and felt like we were just being stared at, well to be honest we went thru the wrong door but geesh what a way to make us feel so awkward the staff just stared at us instead of helping us and then we heard two of the girls whispering who knows what maybe because we have a family of 7 +1 and it was intimidating seeing all of us walk in?? Not sure... we waited about 20min before we walked finally don't know why or how they took so long to seat us when there were clearly about 15-25 chairs to the left side of the restaurant anyway they ruined what we had planned and whoever is managing that place should really take more interest in how that place is being ran and how there staff greets customers very very poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands,2.52,2.76,2.76,,2.664

The host working tonight was in a bad mood and had an attitude but our server was awesome. The apps we got were good, the Texas fries and chips and guac.  However, my grilled chicken salad was the worst salad I've ever had , i don't really know how you can mess up something so simple but my chicken was soggy. My moms ribs were good but both the broccoli and corn on the con sides were horrible.

It was so good that I took the time to find out the name of the chef (Isaac, by the way) and I very honestly plan to call ahead in the future and find out if he's working when I go so I'll know it's a good day to get the steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands,2.64,2.76,2.76,,2.712
