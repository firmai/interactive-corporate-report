Food was on point and we even had dessert, try the blondie! We even got to color a chili and they said they would put it up on the wall, haha.

35,Morris K.,"Phoenix, AZ",1172,85,,3.0,2013-12-06,"================== RETURN VISIT UPDATE ================== Came again Thursday night after a meeting I attended with nine other people. It was the same group of people I went with in my first review of this establishment.  The group was seated right away and our drink orders were taken. So why the low rating? Why? Because I ordered the Mango-Chile Tilapia. I took one bite and thought it was terrible. If you've seen my other reviews I normally like Tilapia so it wasn't the fish it was how the fish was prepared. It was cooked fine but the Mango-sauce with avocados on top was not appetizing. At this point everyone in our party was served and enjoying their meals. I was waiting for the waitress to come around and ask if anyone needed refills or how was their food, But she was nowhere to be found. When she finally did come around everyone was just about finished with their meals. Then she asks about how everyone's food was. So I told her. Someone who I assume was a manger comes over and asks if I wanted her to have my meal recooked. At first I said no I just wanted it taken off my bill.. because everyone was already done.  After awhile I reluctantly agreed to having my meal recooked without the mango sauce TO-GO..Upon reflection I should have asked for the meal to be comp'd and be done with it.  FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from a Chili's Restaurant. :  SERVICE: I must admit for a large group we did receive good service. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is OK. AMBIANCE: It's like every other Chili's. CONCLUSION: When this sort of thing happens I don't know about you but it can completely ruin your dinning experience. I mean nothing ruins my mood easier than a poor meal when I'm expecting something much better. How I respond depends on my mood and on the circumstances. I didn't appreciate the waitress not returning to our table for such a long time because this whole experience could have been avoided. . RETURN FACTOR 50-50....%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business.

I have a daughter with special needs and often times when we go out wait staff tends to be stand offish, but not this gentleman. I wish I could remember his name but I did ask for the manager and gave a raving review at the time of our visit. The second and third times I went here I was not as impressed. The wait staff was not nearly as friendly and the last time I went there I seriously felt like my daughter and I were an inconvenience even though we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 20 minutes.

Albeit it was a Sunday afternoon so it was a smidge slower than say a Friday night, it was still a nice. The chips we had for the chips and salsa were warm and delicious and the lighter fare chicken salad was excellent. One of the waitresses however seem to be having a bad day as it appeared she was in some type of disagreement with one of her tables.

21,Jonathan G.,"Mesa, AZ",18,22,13.0,3.0,2014-06-16,"Well. Overall I do like this place. They have good food and reasonable prices. However, I wouldn't order any steaks. I do know they are not a steak house and they prove it. First, they cook steaks on a flat top not an open grill which just leaves to sit and cook in its own juices, second, they go by temperature of the meat to tell them when it's done not the feel which is ok if you make sure that the temperature is consistent through out the meat. I have been to a couple of chilis and both the same result. I order medium and it ends up where most of the stake is almost still raw, purple, not just link with blood, raw.  I was told that medium is mostly pink and pointed to the menu that states medium is ""light pink with no traces of red"" so obviously the cooks don't understand the different temperature of meat.  If you order a steak tear it a part.

I ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla and after a couple of bites there was this nasty hard stuff in the quesadilla. My waitress didn't come check on me for a long time so I just sat there making faces. Finally, the manager was checking on the table next to mine, saw my face and asked if everything was alright. I showed him the hard plastic like pieces in the quesadilla and at first he tried to say it was burnt cheese. He leaves to get my waitress after I bang it on the table to show him it's not burnt cheese. The waitress comes over and says ""well what do you want us to do?"". I tell her I just want my bill so I can leave.

She orders hers, i order mine, and we order one to go for someone else back at work.

19,Jerry M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2016-03-15,"Hey just a shout out to all you fellow Yelpers. This location/franchise is rotten from the top down. The pervasive apathy of the staff, including the manager is pathetic. I had not been to a Chili's in quite some time and after my experience today, I am sure my next visit will sometime around the 1st of Neveruary! I wish I could make this blog short but no I'm sorry this deserves some detail!  So I stopped by today around 4:30 for some happy because traffic was backed up on the 101. The bar was nearly empty and a server was sitting at the bar sharing a ""bitch session"" with the bartender. I ordered only two items- a Fat Tire draft beer and an order of wings with what I think to be a simple and common request- that the wings be cooked well done and extra crispy. What I was served about ten minutes later was this hot mess pile of tiny, under cooked, over sauced, soggy, biggest insult to Buffalo wings I have ever encountered. I ate one bite of one wing and it could not have been more perfectly, 100% opposite of what I had ordered and been expecting. So I pushed them aside, finished my beer and attempted to use the little kiosk terminal on the bar to tab out, but of course it was not even close to correct so I asked the bartender for my check. She was observant enough to see I didn't eat the wings and asked what was wrong. When I told her they were not extra crispy and a soggy, hot mess she insisted they cooked them ""twice as long"" (so I assume 4 minutes in the microwave instead of 2). But no worries my phenomenal bartender says she will take them off the tab and then hand me a check for two Fat Tire drafts instead of one. When I called her out on that, she got upset and insisted I had two so I said okay, fine how about you call the manager over here for me and she said sure and left the bar.  A few minutes later, a fifty something blond lady shows up, does not even bother to introduce herself and simply says I'm the manager and asks what was wrong. I proceeded to tell her the above experience and her reply was simply "" oh well everybody makes mistakes, what are you asking me for here?"" I mean really? So that's what they taught you to say at Chili's University! Her apathetic, I could care less attitude is all I needed to know to understand just what is going on at this location. Her base, unprofessional attitude made it obvious she has no standards and therefore neither does the staff! So wow, if you have to go to a Chili's and I have no idea why you would, please for the love of God don't go to this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

16,Jon R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,2.0,2016-03-30,"This is a long review, by far my longest, but I feel this must be done.    I  have been a frequent of chili's for the past 25 years. When I graduated from bootcamp (USMC), my dad asked me where I wanted to go. Could have been anywhere, and I mean anywhere, but I said Chilis because I wanted the original chicken crispers, And I have gotten the chicken crispers every time almost since the beginning. They are the best in the crisper business, especially when u pair them with chili's awesome ranch and honey mustard.  I have been coming less and less though over the past year. While service stays on par, the quality of food is going down. The crispers have gotten to the size of a MC Donald's chicken nugget and the wife and I both agree the chicken always seems chewy. Not like how it used to be. My orders of kid crispers 25 years ago had more food on the plate then my order yesterday. And it's not just this experience. It is almost every experience. I could keep going on how disappointed I am with what this location has done to my love for chilies original chicken crispers but I feel my point is made.... My wife normally gets the pasta dish on the 2/20 menu and does not order it anymore because something about it changes or they cook it wrong every time.  I will give them a high five for not messing up the side salad yet but I am not keeping my hopes up. Also the panko fried onion rings (i think it is what they were called) were pretty good and I would order them again if I return before they take them off.  So the service is decent. The bartender/ cocktail server/ hostess does her best. But whenever we are there she seems to be the only one who actually cares about customer service. She can take a while to get to you but she seems to do more then anyone there. So kudos to her. I can't remember her name but she is always in the bar it seems after 4 PM when we go.  I will also give them another high five because this location keeps it pretty clean. From the outside to the doors to the bathrooms to the floors. It's clean.  This location is right down the street from me but I will start going to different locations to see if the chicken crisper problem is this store or chain wide. I am ready to give up on this location but not my crispers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

I got off work early last week and decide to grab 2 happy hour drinks at Chill's while I waited for a friend to get off work.  Besides myself there were 6 other people in the entire restaurant on a Thursday afternoon (3:30-4 ish).  I ordered the Presidente Margarita because the bartender told me how this one was so much better than the regular Margarita.  Nothing taste Presidential about the damn thing!  Cool .. I decided after my second sip that my next drink would be liquor, ice and lime.   Before my second drink I ordered the happy hour portion of Texas fries.  They look so good on the menu.  When I received mine however, they were old fries that were just sitting for a while, then thrown in the oven with cheese, bacon and peppers ... all the things I like but it seems they must have forgotten about the the Texas fries in the oven because the skillet was scorching hot but the fries taste old and the cheese was almost burnt and the bacon pieces were so hard that I just decided not to include any on my fork.  Bummer! I followed by gut and ordered just a well Tequila, on the rocks with lots of lime.  I'll go back to Chill's for happy hour ONLY because it's across the street from job.  I wouldn't bother stopping in otherwise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

3,Tricia C.,"Phoenix, AZ",510,251,1203.0,3.0,2017-06-10,"We started with the spinach queso dip. It was decently good. I mean how can you go wrong with melted cheese? The cheese in the dip was a white cheese that had a mild flavor that went well with the spinach that was nicely chopped up in the dip. My favorite part was the scoop of guac in the center of the dip. Unfortunately, the guac was mostly one hard piece of avocado. I had to use my knife to cut it down to scoopable chip sized pieces. To make the queso dip better, I think maybe adding some garlic flavor to it should do the trick. The dip came with a large basket of chips and a small bowel of salsa. I have always loved Chili's chips. They are so thin, yet so crispy.  For dinner, we ordered the honey chipotle Chicken Crispers and a fresco side salad. The honey chipotle Chicken Crispers came served on top of waffles and were topped with applewood bacon, jalapeños and green onions.  The honey chipotle sauce was surprisingly spicier than I thought it would be, which I liked. The were supposed to drizzled with ancho-chile ranch, but I didn't really notice any ranch anywhere so it either wasn't there or was really lightly drizzled. The chicken was really good. It was nice and moist on the inside. The waffles were ok, nothing to write home about. The waffle were kind of dry and a little on the dense side. The crispers came with a side of homestyle fries and a side of honey chipotle sauce. I drizzled the extra honey chipotle sauce over my waffles to give it more flavor and help moisten them up a bit. I liked the sauce so much I also dipped my fries in it. The fresco side salad was a basic spring mix salad topped with queso fresco dressed in a honey lime vinaigrette. For a side salad, it was a decent size. It was refreshing and helped break up the heavy dinner and appetizer. I really liked the dressing that was on it.  We got our leftovers to go and our waiter brought out a bag for our chips and had some extra chips in the bag for us! OMG! Chips! I love that their bags are tailored for reheating their chips in the microwave so you can have hot chips at home! Our waiter was awesome. It think his name was Martino? (I am so sorry if that was not your name) It was like he could read my mind. Everything I needed before I even needed to ask for it or even before I knew I needed it.

Or is Chili's a local restaurant with charm, a bustling local scene, bursting with culture? Chili's is, in fact, both. Chili's is a blend of that hometown restaurant that only you know about as well as the great experience of a steakhouse. There's nothing better than walking into a Chili's. If you want to have a great time, you're in the right place. First, restaurant was clean, smelled great, and has music at a reasonable volume. The greeter is always attentive to welcome you in. We were seated quickly, and our server was very friendly and attentive. He quickly took care of us and gave us water (we even had 7 people at our table and he still was on top of it all). Even better, the food came out quickly, and it was hot off the grill. I personally got the Sunrise Burger, and I can tell you, it was AMAZING. It is by FAR one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Lastly, dessert. I got the molten lava cake. You've probably heard it before. It was DIVINE. Warm, delicious fudge inside a fluffy cake topped with a cool vanilla ice cream scoop. Nothing beats that! Not to mention it was my 21st birthday. And I can say that it was one of the best birthdays I've had in a LONG time. I couldn't think of anywhere else to spend my birthday other than Chili's!
