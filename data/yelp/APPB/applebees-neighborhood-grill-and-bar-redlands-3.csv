Dave H.,"Highland, CA",20,33,,4.0,1/6/2017,"First time eating here and overall was a good evening. The only bummer of it was the two year old child seated behind/next to us with her two siblings and inattentive mother. Almost ruined the evening. Who brings a toddler to a bar and grill anyways? Anywho, the food was good (but wasn't necessarily as advertised in the menu... and changing potato sides cost extra? ... why?)  However, we still enjoyed ourselves. The place was rather loud but that's to be expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=20
Marcia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",99,348,398,5.0,11/24/2016,"Went for a late lunch and I ordered my favorite salad, Oriental Chicken with a side of extra dressing because they don't give you enough. My son ordered a chicken finger basket, these 2 entrees were the best options for the 2 for 20 deal, which comes with an appetizer. Our server was great and checked on us for refills. Then a manager checked on us and they had a notice on the menu holder that if your server doesn't offer one of their gift cards to buy then you get free dessert. We brought that to the managers attention, and she said that he hadn't checked us out just yet with a bill. So basically, give him a chance. So we did. He came by and we did order dessert. After that he brought the bill, in which the manager was with him. Still he didn't say the offer. The server said, he wasn't aware of that, even though the notice is on every table. The manager took him to the register, and she apparently took the dessert charge off. Thanks to my son, who was on it because I didn't even want dessert. I say all this to commend Applebees to sticking to their word.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=20

Ramiro C.,"Anaheim, CA",93,120,5,1.0,2/18/2015,"I use to love the happy hour...the staff are all pretty cool I know 2 of them personally.  What really kills me is not the lack of service but the lack of quality. Bonless wings have come out Luke warm the last 3x But this last time just did it for me I ordered a Long island ice tea and on top of the lemon wedge they put in the drink was some sort of big insect.  The waiter was like ""oooh yeah thats a bug should I call the manager?""  And I was like ueah and call the Orkin Man .... Manager on duty was very apologetic ...she said I wont charge you for the drink.....I never even took a sip, so that was obvious.  I had a quesadilla and she didnt charge me for that $4 on happy hour and I said ok.   What wasnt ok was that the 2 other people were only half way done with the plates they ordered and they didn't want to eat no more.  Nothing was done about that...just sorry and a free quesadilla they didn't charge.  I didn't make a big deal out of it, they got our $75 but we wont be back again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=20
Keyantta H.,"Redlands, CA",0,11,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Worst experience tonight at Applebee's. I placed an online order and the site said my food would be ready at 7:11pm. The site even asked for my make, model and color of my car. I thought awesome, I will pull up they will bring my food and home I go. Well not so. I arrived, server comes out confirms order and goes back inside, server comes back out brings check and I sign, says they are putting it together and it will be right out. I sit and wait and wait and wait. I go in 35 min later, they get the manager and she said oh we were getting some boxes and we just have the bread left to box up.

Scott S.,"Napa, CA",193,118,190,1.0,12/9/2014,"I don't know you well enough to tell you the story of how I ended up at this Applebees, so let's just skip over that part. THE STEAK: My god, the food here sucks. I ordered a sirloin steak that was advertised on the menu as either 8 or 9 ounces (I don't remember exactly which). Part of the problem with picture menus is that the pictures show a BIG beautiful steak shot by a professional food stylist in a studio set up. What I got on my plate instead was the saddest, misshapen piece of low grade beef I think I've ever seen. If you look at the picture I posted, you'll see that the size of this thing barely qualifies as a chicken tender. And it was basically slapped on a plate and previously frozen French fries thrown on the plate. After dinner, I asked my mom if I could pop one of her muscle relaxers because my jaw was so sore from gnawing on this piece of meat that had the texture of rehydrated beef jerky. THE TABLE: As I was praying to God to make me a bird so I could fly away... far, far away... I looked up, and on the wall of our booth was a big collage of pictures of the local police department. Okay, I get that this big corporate giant is trying to fool people into thinking that they're a local community restaurant by posting pictures of local firemen, little league teams, etc. But honestly, this is the most awkward, inhospitable, and unappetizing thing you could put on the wall, just short of pictures of local morticians. You can see from the pictures I posted that I was looking up at pictures of SWAT teams, a militarized police force, and even a picture of some cop in full tactical gear on the side of someone's house with an HK MP5 submachine gun raised and ready to kill someone. Applebee's, thanks for reminding me that the community of Redlands, California isn't much that much different from Fallujah or Kandahar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=20
Kathryn H.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,10,4,2.0,6/3/2017,The bartender Jade is terrible! Zero interest in her customers and I had to ASK for a menu. She didn't even offer. Was more interested in the males at the bar than females. This place needs to bring back bartenders who get to know their customers and take pride in good service.

Gabriella S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,15,3,1.0,3/30/2017,Won't return here ever. It's been about 7 years since I've been to an Applebee's and now I remember why. Service and cleanliness. Last time I was here I received the dirtiest silverware ever and my artichoke dip was freezing. During my last visit tonight (my friends suggestion) the floors were all disgusting and dirty with food and debris. Seating areas were all dirty and stained with old foods. Nadia the very pleasant and polite hostess seated us and took our drink orders at 8:58pm our waitress (who we understand was overwhelmed) did not see us until 9:14 -I was on my phone once she arrived. I understand it's just a Thursday but perhaps staffing should be amped up when it comes to your happy hour. She was dealing with too many tables and had no problem expressing that to us as we wAited for her to take our orders. I got a 4- cheese mac and cheeses with chicken fingers. IT WAS FREAKING COLD. Even had my friend try it to see if I was being dramatic and she called the waitress to have it reheated. I gave the waitress the plate with 5 chicken stripes and two spirals of macaroni taken out. She returned it with  3 chicken strips and the entire plate in disarray. I let it go for my friends sake. But I will never return and never advise my guests to waste their time/money  on this place. I should've stuck to my seven year strike on this establishment,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=20

Tonight....Jerrad made our visit. He was running the show... waiting tables and tending bar; a jack of all trades. He was warm and friendly, and made us laugh. A truly great server makes you feel like you went to dinner and a show. He even brought me and my adult daughter coloring sheets and crayons, simply because he could.  I ordered the 6 oz.

Wait N. SE E.,"Redlands, CA",30,25,156,4.0,8/6/2014,"Tonight we called in some desserts for the crew. Unfortunately, after 9 p.m.  the employees are not able to deliver curbside.  Despite that, Mayra was awesome in assisting with my order. Excellent option for a rainy night! Everything in our order was accurate and the food was great! This makes up for a previous trip, where a waitress(who shall remain nameless) accidentally dropped an entire plate of food at our table, landing on my husband. She simply was not paying attention as she was focused on another conversation.  I chose not to write a negative review at that time because the manager was on top of the situation and acted accordingly. Generally we have a great experience overall and end up with servers such aa Brandon, who is attentative, swift, polite and friendly.

Marko A.,"Redlands, CA",11,12,3,2.0,3/10/2017,"Not sure if this place is under new man but customer service has seriously gone down hill.They always used to be welling at the door and even open the door for us. Now they just stand there watching you come in with a dirty look on their face. The past few times we've been seated and we didn't have any dish ware up the to point when the food arrives we still didn't have spoons or forks. This last visits some young lady walked passed our table very quickly and dropped off the spoons and forks but slamming it on our table and walked away saying nothing. How rude was that!? We always seem to have two to three different waitresses though out our course of dinner. There's no bond with one waitress when you just got 3 different people bringing you food, drinks and appetizers. Food is never hot it's warm as well. This Applebee's used to be great and it's gone seriously down hill.

Kirari S.,"Colton, CA",303,181,691,3.0,3/3/2012,"This place is always the hang out at night. But at lunch it's pretty good for it's price and if your looking to count your calories and/or on weight watchers.   This place is like a step above Denny's/IHOP and below BJ's. So in essence, it's like a Red Robin or Chili's. While some people think that all American food is the same everywhere, it's not.   Every time I've been here the service has been good. It's not like they drop off the face of the earth but it's not like they come every 10min checking up on you either. Their lunch menu is good and is decently priced. This time around I tried their Weight Watchers menu and had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with rice and spinach. It wasn't bad. The spinach was a bit dry (on top) and had no taste so I had to squeeze lemon on it and mix it around so it got all moist again. The chicken was juicy and a good size and was pretty good. It's made for WW points so don't expect like major uber flavor. It's chicken that was seasoned well and had flavor (but something that can be made at home for a lesser price).  In my previous visits the spinach and artichoke dip is always good and for sharing.  This place is great for late night happy hours (for those $5 silver shots) and appetizers and great for big parties. And just to let some know: Chili's uses boxed Velveeta mac n cheese and a majority of their food is never fresh and always frozen. I've heard so from the employee's who work there and don't even eat there. Also the cooks are not trained cooks. At least at Applebee's I've had better food for cheaper price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=60

Lots of festive colors and lighting, the bar in the middle. The plasmas up everywhere showing the lakers game, what more can you want. The appetizers were awesome, my favorite is the potato thin crisps with the spinach aritchoke dip, the boneless buffalo wings, Of course we did the 2 for 20 deal. The meals was good on my end, except my sister ordered a steak and it wasnt fully cooked, basically not as it was advertised. But the staff was cool about it and didnt interrogate my sister. They simply came over and apologized and gave her a second order and it turned out to be of her liking.  They didnt charge us twice.  HAPPY HOUR IS ON POINT! 3 bucks for cocktails such as long islands long beaches and stuff I enjoyed that very much :)  it wasnt watered down.

The food: I ordered the chicken bacon cheese sandwich with onion rings and the chicken (I think that is what it was) had the consistency of a hockey puck..No taste what-so-ever and it tasted like it had been frozen since 1979..daughters chicken wrap was the same..granddaughters chicken strips were over fried to the point of tasting like leather...only good thing was the sliced apple wedges (hard to screw that up)..I am done with Applebees..$50 waste of money...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3

The bartender and manager serving us were friendly, polite, and provided great customer service. There was a guy sitting at the bar with his friends who seems to have had one too many beers and would stop loudly cussing and ranting angrily with homophobic slurs and the manager was pretty prompt and professional in handling it, whereas in my experience in other family restaurants that serve alcohol, the situation will just be ignored until it has already escalated too far.

I wasn't completely wrong with what type of people this place brings in but the food is good! The drinks are super cheap during happy hour/Sundays and they have enough tv's to catch any sport I'm trying to watch. I'll be honest, my wife and I have to be in an Applebees mood to eat here. This means that we don't care what kind of service we get, we don't feel like spending much more than $30, and I may or may not be wearing slippers so that I fit in with the other guests lol. Only on a few occasions do we not sit at the bar. Some of the local oldies seem to like to try and chat with everyone at the bar no matter how far away you sit. All and all, we like having a place to go where we have zero expectations and want something cheap. We have found multiple things on their menu that we end up craving. The mac and cheese with chicken strips is so tasty. As long as nobody we know sees us walk in there we will keep eating here.

Danny V.,"Rialto, CA",565,71,49,3.0,11/16/2016,"I'm in a bit of mixed feelings with Applebee's to be honest. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible but still bringing up my tastes and distastes with them.  In the past, I have had extremely horrible service mixed a bland menu or maybe just my luck catching bad cooks on duty (In my opinion based off 10 years of memories). My definition of bad service: not refiling my drink; forgetting about me at the table; waiting an extended period of time to be seated, take my order, or just check to make sure I'm still alive. I will state a huge award winning thing that they do is show MAJOR support to military veterans. Myself being a disabled veteran I often find that companies off other discounts but elect to lookover veterans. Thank you Applebee's for being a huge supporter in supporting the troops and veterans. My most recent visit to Applebee's (the visit at this location in Redlands), I ordered Pomegranate Lemonade and the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi. First I'll speak on the ordering system, I absolutely love it, it makes ordering quick and easy, as well calling over a server as respectful as possible at the click of a bottom rather than at the snap of your finger. Even upon checkout paying on the system. Being seated and bringing the food and drinks is the only true thing the server has to focus on (the most important part of the experience next to their knowledge on the food if there is any questions.) My Pomegranate Lemonade was great. The balance of syrup and lemonade was very even. As well, the syrup having fresh Pomegranate pieces in it. Very refreshing. As far as the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi, I don't have much to say.. Not a good thing but not a bad thing. It was just ok. Sauces consistency wasn't as thick as I'd like it to have been, was a bit thin (in my opinion but as it cool it thickened to what I would of wanted when it was hot.) Additionally, it was very light on chicken, cheap option to save a bit of money? Possibly. They chicken was nicely blackened, I did enjoy it. Overall the pasta was decent. Not the best but no the worst by far.  I waiting a bit before getting seated but over all the service and servers where awesome. One complain I do have, although, I understand for profit reasons. The manager asked (trying to convince change my selection) me to change my lemonade to a margarita. Myself being in recovery from drug/alchole addiction I wasn't to please with what seemed to be pressure to drink an alcholic beverage. I have no issue with declining but I know others that are fresh in their recovery that may not be able to. Other than that, service was great. It's Applebee's. Great for lunch and happy hour.

Just the right amount of creamy dressing and thinly sliced pieces of Parmesan cheese. Rivals what you get in much more expensive restaurants. Definitely worth the extra $2.50.  I ordered from the under 550 calorie section. 7oz sirloin steak was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Came with some roasted potatoes and a big mushroom with with a creamy spinach filling.

Sam O.,"Orange, CA",129,272,100,1.0,7/13/2010,"Q&D:  One step above my microwave. Long & Blah: Applebee's will never be Chili's, no matter how hard they try.  Their menu is eerily similar to Chili's and I don't think that is a good thing.  I love Chili's food and think they have some great stuff, but Applebee's took their ideas and made them worse. I don't currently work in customer service but I have worked in restaurants for over ten years and most of those jobs were at corporate style Applebee's-esque type places and I can tell you that it's not an easy job.  The managers make you memorize scripts, you are always afraid of being ""Shopped"" by a secret shopper, and you have to kiss ass constantly so as to not get a complaint, it sucks!  That is why I feel for the workers at this place. As soon as you walk in to this place you can feel the cheese, and I'm not talking food here.  The staff has been programmed so much that there isn't any feeling left in ""Welcome to Applebee's!""  They should have a robot up there to do it or an automated sound that say's it when you open the door.  This happens at every level too.  The servers are sing-songy and talk to you like you are a retarded child.  The managers are just as bad and seem beaten down and abused by forever having to lick the tangy buttholes of geriatric seniors on a Sunday, it's sad. The food here is not very good but it's not bad either.  It would be nice if there was some FRESH chef specials that were offered that you could only find at that store.  It's sad that you can't get anything unique at an Applebee's.  Everything they have has already been done by Chili's, TGIFriday's, CPK, (insert corporate chain here).   I'm no snooty Foodie, I mean I like fried crap just as much as the next guy but Applebee's can suck it!  I don't understand how they stay in business.  The people that work here are good people and it's not their fault, it's the upper management that is really retarded.  Can't they see that people want something other than what they think we want?   Would I go here again?  Oh, I hope not.

Mark M.,"Loma Linda, CA",16,59,3,3.0,1/30/2015,"Uniqueness in food is a major quality i'm after. There are so many places with the same type of food. I would come back for their swiss burger. The service in this specific place is good. The servers are attentive.  But like I said, i gotta try more food at this place til i'm hit with something that'll just keep calling me back. The probably plays a major factor when I'm rating a place. Who knows, i eat here again and some food on the menu item gets me to raise the ratings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=40

Marcy R.,"San Bernardino, CA",43,8,4,1.0,10/10/2015,"This past Wednesday  me and a couple of friends and family were celebrating a very special celebration and decided to go to applebees and enjoy some drinks , we had two drinks and one gummy bear shot each . When we tried ordering another the waiter informed us that his manager said we can not due to the fact that there is a 3 drink policy . The manager came to talk to us and was just no help, she was very rude when questions were asked and informed us that her options were to either call a taxi or the police . (* Not knowing none of us were driving*) bottom line is applebees needs to have it in fine print if this is seriously a rule of yours. I will definitely not be coming back to this location ever again . Neither will anyone I know .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=40

Rebecca D.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,21,17,5.0,1/5/2016,I love Applebee's. They are pretty consistent with their food. You can count on it to taste the same every time you come.

Evan R.,"Redlands, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/21/2016,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.. Ordered a oriental chicken salad and the lettuce was old and discolored, the chicken was overcooked, and the beer I ordered was flat and odd tasting even though it was a local craft beer(due to lack of cleaning the tap lines). The only decent thing was the fries which I had off of someone's plate in my party in which they ordered along with some tough to eat riblets. Definitely won't be coming back. The only reason for deserving a single star was the waitress being nice and courteous..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=40
Claire S.,"Redlands, CA",154,5,1,5.0,6/4/2016,"*** could not post on my account so I'm posting from a friends*** I never write Yelp reviews, in fact this is my first but I figured this visit would be a great first review. For starters the service was excellent. Our server Mark made sure we were completely satisfied with our meals. I made the unfortunate mistake of order a burger that had pork in it, I dont eat pork but had told Mark not to worry about it. When my company was finished with her meal another employee named Josh I believe (super cute, colored eyes, light skin) noticed I had only taken a bite of my burger and offered to bring out a new one or comp our bill. The manager who's name slips my mind but she had short hair came out and apologized, service was great and everyone was so kind. I'm very pleased with this visit. - Sarah Gillespie",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=40
Ross T.,"Highland, CA",2,118,88,3.0,7/16/2015,"Was hungry like a muscled up GIJoe after a long day in the chopper. Order service was prompt. Boneless wings  and ""hand battered fish"" with fries. Fries were salted like it was a prank. Were they potatoes? Couldn't taste them through the salt coating. Fish tasted like cliche frozen fish. The last time a hand battered them was probably many months ago and thousands of miles away. Wing were average with heavy honey barbecue sauce. Employees appeared to really want to serve our needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=40
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",167,885,685,3.0,2/25/2015,This location was meh! I did have a sangria margarita which was tasty so that's why they get the three stars for the bar. Our server was busy and ended up leaving during our order so someone else took over for her. In general service was just ok and food was just ok at this location. Nothing really was tasty and seemed a bit bland. A smaller location compared to some others. The bar area seemed to be a nice size. It looked a bit run down and not so clean to me. Again my opinion. I would probably not choose to come to this location again ...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-redlands-3?start=40

I didn't care why or how it happened all I wanted was my money..so after all that s**t I gave up and just called my bank to block those charges and got my refund through my bank and have them deal with Applebee's..
