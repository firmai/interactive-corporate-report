6,Phil W.,"Addison, IL",15,29,17.0,3.0,2012-02-05,"This town is terrible, all the pubs close early.  Anyway, after not finding any good pubs in town, I decided to just bite the bullet and eat at Fridays.  The food was standard, tasty, but nothing to write about.  The service was great though, the bartender was very accommodating and attentive.  Their beer selection was piss poor, so I had to slum it with Blue moon.  Anyway, pretty ok dinner all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale?start=20,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284
3,Steve M.,"Cincinnati, OH",63,94,2.0,1.0,2013-03-05,"I'm sooo not a big fan of this place! I went there after work (4 hrs; plus a 6-7 hr nursing clinical prior to work). My work is right near Tri-County (~10 min. away), so I thought that I would stop in because I was starving and because I heard about their new deal, the 1 appetizer and 1 entree for $10 deal (includes the Jack Daniel's burger and shrimp!). I sat at the bar. It took FOREVER to get the bartender. She, at first was with a three person group that was taking their time with the menu (reasonable), but she had to dive into detail on each item. Then she got to me, just to get a beer and then the menu! It took a little while because they didn't have the cards/display for the items in their $10 deal! I ordered the BBQ Chicken Flat bread, which was fantastic! and the Jack Daniel's Burger.  The Manager actually came out and delivered me the burger. I have to be frank, but the jack Daniel's Burger wasn't what it was all hyped up to be from their adds! It was just a regular burger, with a little sauce cup of Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce! I thought that the burger was going to be coated/grilled in/with the BBQ sauce, not just ""pour it over yourself"". I got done and the bartender told me she usually works better when it's not slammed. It was a MONDAY night!!! Nothing much goes on on a Monday (My family owns a bar, I know from both owning and being a server (first hand experience) at a restaurant!!!!). Also, as I was nearing the end of my burger (2 bites left), she starts fiddling with the TVs to get another game on....theres customers around the restaurant wanting beer and booze, and she's futzing with the damn TVs!! UC's bad game was already over (5 min left), so there was really no excuse for the piss poor service. I'm NEVER eating here again and you can quote me on that! The only good thing was asking my name at the beginning, to make the service more personal. What that really did was remind/emphasize more how bad this service was. I got there at about 7: 45-50ish. I had to be done eating (not much order!) by ( PM for a fasting blood draw, a requirement of my doctor's physical later in the week. I barely got done eating at 8:56 because the service was so slow I'm hoping that the managers are on Yelp and do see this review because it was BAD!

26,Carolyn B.,"Cincinnati, OH",348,331,1136.0,2.0,2013-08-15,"Although they give large portions, I find their food to be nothing to write home about and the noise level is too high to make having a meal there enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248
2,Nairb R.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,4,1.0,1.0,2014-06-18,Lunch visit.  I went with chicken finger lunch combo with salad. Barely any ranch on salad. Very small portion of fries and the worst chicken fingers ever. They seem to be cheap frozen chicken fingers. I expected fresh hand battered chicken.  Even my water sucked! Stuffed with lemons and seeds floating everywhere. I dont know why people come to these crappy corporate chains.  Never will be back period!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale?start=20,,,,,
24,Kyle H.,"Cincinnati, OH",156,86,293.0,5.0,2014-07-21,"I'm really not sure why there's so many negative reviews. I've been here several times for lunch and dinner. I'm always seated promptly, I've yet to experience a wait in the lobby. Their staff is always very prompt and courteous. The food is always correct, and hot and looks highly presentable and appealing. I've dined at many other Friday's and I think this is a great location and I love coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
1,Edna S.,"Cincinnati, OH",196,47,55.0,5.0,2014-08-31,"To me, TGIF is the best of this type of rest. They were very attentive even when they were about to close",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale?start=20,,,,,
5,David ..,"Milford, OH",0,42,1.0,1.0,2014-10-04,"It's a shame there isn't a negative star system. This location is consistently poor. Every time I get roped into coming here with a group, I regret it more.  The burger tonight was bleeding, the frys were cold and barely covered a third of the plate.  Two out of our three meals had to be sent back. And that ruins the meal for all of us. One person eats while the other two sit and wait even longer....and we already waited too long in the first place for this sub-par restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale?start=20,,,,,
0,Steve B.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,47,19.0,1.0,2014-12-01,"Now I remember why we haven't been here in 4 or so years. The service in this place is horrible, to slow for a  place that is empty, 22 customers in the building counting my 4 for Sunday lunch should been enough warning to stay away.  Wait to get seated ten minutes for the drinks then another ""We'll be right back to take your order"" long break.  Do yourself a favor and eat someplace else.   This place hasenst been worth a dang in years",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale?start=20,,,,,
25,Bob D.,"Cincinnati, OH",22,138,140.0,2.0,2015-03-03,"Went for lunch and it was terrible. The onion soup was very good and the same as I remember it (otherwise a 1 star) but everything else fell short. Everyone I was with was unhappy with what they got. I also ordered the french dip which is not the same as the first time I ordered it when it was on the original menu.  The portion was smaller and the onions were not cooked well and the bread was stale and not toasted.  I used to go to Fridays on a weekly basis as a kid and now I find myself going once a year, and only when its on the companies dime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
18,Khiemo S.,"Cincinnati, OH",90,106,655.0,1.0,2015-03-04,"Wow, probably my last time going to a Friday's. Thank God I didn't pay for it or else I would've been extremely upset. I didn't expect much out of a Friday's but this was probably the worst Friday's experience I've ever had.  The cheddar broccoli was decent but my burgers and fries were terrible. I actually felt bad after eating it. Fries were hard and cold. Burger was dry and bland. I would've been much happier with a burger and fries from Burger King or any other fast food place. $12 for a small, crappy burger. Wow, never going to that Friday's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
14,Gloria Z.,"Hempstead, NY",114,309,1192.0,3.0,2015-06-24,"Two and a half stars really, but I'm feeling charitable tonight. Back here after a long absence, due to a 20% off coupon. The food is good to very good. Tonight I had the glazed grilled chicken and spinach, which arrived exactly as described and was flavorful and satisfying. And, under 500 calories, woohoo! Perfect portion size for dinner, and priced right too. The menu is more diverse than a couple years ago with more lighter options available and portions that won't stuff you. The tomato mozzarella salad accompanying it was quite good, including fresh basil.  The service, meh. We walked in behind a party of two, with another party behind us. The host station was abandoned. We were joking about it. Nobody there, and we could also hear the phone ringing, ringing, ringing, as though in an empty house. Employees were crossing the floor within our line of vision, but none glanced our way. This around the peak dinner hour on a weeknight. We decided to just belly up to the bar and eat there. The two barmaids were giving it their all, but they were totally lacking in personality. Food took an age to arrive, but as mentioned it was quite tasty.  Fridays has a club and once you give them your email, you get lots of offers and coupons. This is the sort of a place where you go if you're hungry, on a budget, and don't feel like cooking, and are prepared to wait awhile. The $3 Cosmo (Thursday special) also helped round up the rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
21,Mike M.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,5,6.0,1.0,2015-09-21,"I've been a patron for this establishment for at least 15 years. I've notice that in the last year the kitchen has not been paying attention to the details.  Tonight I got shrimp pasta and it comes with red bell peppers. One of my read Bell peppers had the sticker still on it when the meal was served to me. Question 1 why is this sticker still on? Question 2: Was the pepper even washed off? Question 3: How clean are the hands of the prep crew? I showed the manager Sara or Mary, and she didn't say sorry, she just said "" the kitchen manager is in tonight and I will tell him."" What!? Not sorry can I get you something else, or I'll remove it from your bill. Nothing.  After leaving, I decided to call and when I spoke to the manager to express my disappointment, she replied that a sticker isn't that bad and that the prep crew is human and can make mistakes.  It's clear that it's not just the kitchen employees , but the management and culture of this place don't feel their customers deserve quality.  I won't be going to this place again. And I've spent thousands of dollars at this place over the years. Maybe I'll write corporate too and see how they feel about the Lack luster attitudes and culture of the particular Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
4,Ray B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,17,7.0,1.0,2016-01-16,haven't been here in a while and the service was horrible. after placing our order we waited an hour and 15 minutes for food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale?start=20,,,,,
19,Bob M.,"Burlington, CO",0,94,19.0,5.0,2016-03-29,"Came by on Monday at 630p for dinner with my wife. First time at Friday's in years, just so many other places we like. After arriving, checked reviews and was surprised to see all the low ratings. However, had a good experience. Food was good and our server Jenny was great. She was extremely friendly and quick to get whatever we needed.  I will certainly come back to enjoy the food again in the near future. The manager came by to check on us which was appreciated. Thanks !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
16,Jennifer T.,"Westerville, OH",61,136,68.0,5.0,2016-04-26,"After a long and fairly taxing weekend, we decided to head to TGI Fridays for all you can eat appetizers with friends before heading back home. Upon arrival, we noticed a sign at the hostess station that said ""Parties of 10 or more will be split up among tables; we cannot move tables to accomodate"". Okay, no big deal. The server who sat us made sure to reiterate this for us (there were 13 people in our party). He sat us at 3 tables that were back to back with each other. The Only reason I am giving 5 stars, and the only reason I didn't leave... THE WAITRESS WAS FREAKING AWESOME. She was very on point with refills and taking orders despite the large party that she had to take care of. She was also genuinely interested in what our event (that had happened that weekend) was all about. She is the reason why I would want to continue to come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
22,Kim N.,"Cridersville, OH",10,91,74.0,3.0,2016-08-08,"Generally we LOVE this place and every server we have had. We eat here weekly during our weekly Cincinnati based medical appointments. Today was disappointing. Food was excellent as usual (except for the Pot Stickers... they were revolting). Waitress was sweet but worthless. At one point we had to ask another staff member to find her for us and her excuse when she arrived was there was a ""staff meeting"" (apparently that only she attended because staff were all over the place and it was supper time). We will be back but will not be placed in her section!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
17,Michelle S.,"Cincinnati, OH",30,4,,1.0,2016-09-18,"This Tgi Fridays needs some serious help in the kitchen. If you're planning on going, stick to appetizers, burgers. My group went yesterday and everyone ordered steaks, ribs and shrimp. Steaks over cooked, wrong sides delivered to table, had to ask for utensils to be brought to table 3 times, refills on drinks. Our bill with food and bar was over $200. Don't waste your time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,

15,Tj M.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,9,,3.0,2016-11-13,Used to enjoy this place. It is usually busy so slightly slow service is understandable. My sticking point is me not wanting to become a victim.

12,Erica M.,"Columbus, OH",73,29,6.0,2.0,2017-02-17,"Stopped for burgers w hubby. Both were poorly made tasted rubbery and overall was a bad experience. We are not picky eaters but the cheese was not melted on my burger, neither one matched the photo in menu and overall bland flavors.

23,John N.,"Dayton, OH",79,8,,2.0,2017-04-03,"Took too long for our food, and our server was slow and a bit rude. (I do have to say, it looked like he was overwhelmed with his large section of tables.) I noticed several times he called out to someone (an employee?) sitting at the bar, ""make yourself useful bruh."" Unprofessional and made us uncomfortable. The rules for ordering the all you can eat apps were odd, as we could only order one at a time and there were no take home boxes provided. (You had to either finish them or they would be thrown out), which was a bit odd since I was paying for them in the first place. I hope this location gets their act together and works on professionalism and manners. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
13,Sam H.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,2,,5.0,2017-04-13,There's​ great food and free WiFi. It's a really nice place to eat with my friends. The waiters/waitresses kept refilling our drinks. They are also quick w/ our food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
11,Eric C.,"Fairfield, OH",20,20,6.0,2.0,2017-05-07,Slowest service I have ever had and everyone meat was dry and overcooked. The sides and apps were excellent tho and everyone can have a bad night. I've had better experiences here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
9,Matthew D.,"Hamilton, OH",3,3,2.0,1.0,2017-06-30,Wow. Should have read the reviews before hand.  The rudeness of the staff and management still continues. After a disagreement over food and pricing (then saying the menu is wrong) I said forget it and was just going to order my food and eat but the server continues to explain and argue. Of course I was never fully able to express my thoughts on the matter because he kept interrupting me in the first place.  After I finally told him to walk away because he wasn't paying any attention to what I was saying ( I had to get a little forceful just so he would hear me)  The manager comes up and asks me what my problem was. I explain that the menu doesn't say what they are saying I would be charged but it doesn't matter because I wasn't going to worry about it any more.  Of course he only heard maybe every third word as he was interrupting me just like the server. Then he says that I can just leave or he would call the cops. Seriously? The cops. Over the fact that their menu doesn't have the right pricing? I tried talking to him explaining that I am hungry and still willing to eat and that I did not have a problem with anything. He threatens me again with the cops.  The only time I got loud was during the continued interruptions. Otherwise I was calm and quiet. The manager is the one that made the scene. I will not be returning to this location  And I will be contacting corporate.  The staff reflects management. And management has issues.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,,,,,
10,Bianca E.,"Cincinnati, OH",127,3,,1.0,2017-09-02,This is the worst Fridays that I have ever been to. Not only as far as food prep but also in regards to customer service. I tried calling several times and got put on hold with no follow up. One of those times I waited for 22 minutes. The second time I was put on hold for about 13 minutes. I ordered something online and went to go pick it up. Not only was my food not ready but they told me they hadn't received the online order. Then I find out that they really just didn't have my dessert but no one even told me they were checking on it after me waiting for 20 minutes. The woman at the bar just kept smiling at me and saying she would have someone check. Soooo disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springdale,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
8,Cecilia S.,"Kansas City, MO",0,3,,1.0,2017-09-10,"Staff members are just as miserable as the patrons.  Between the hostess's lack of care, the less than hospitable service, and sub par food this was a rough lunch experience.
