Yvonne B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,12,4,1.0,12/29/2017,"Apathetic, bad attitudes, awful customer service, SLOW, understaffed, overall POORLY MANAGED.  Once the host finally seated us in the mostly empty restaurant he left us with no menus the ENTIRE time or the high chairs we requested for 2 of our 5 children. I went up to him to ask then he said he would bring them. Then after 10 more mins of no one acknowledging us my husband got up, went to the hostess booth and got them himself.  In the host's defense, he clearly was overworked as a host, server and bus boy assigned to multiple sections. Meanwhile there were literally about 3 female servers who Im hoping were all on break at the same time cause they had NO shame about standing around talkin and laughing.  The booth he sat us in still had the clean-up rag on the table, a dirty saucer and the ketchup rack was on the seat. I ended up moving all of this to a table that had serving trays with half eaten dishes on it.  The waitress who we figured was assigned to that area NEVER once came over to us to.acknowledge us, give us water, or.apologize about the delay. She looked at us several times almost as if our presence annoyed her because she now had more work.  Needless to say after about nearly 20 mins of literally not one person acknowledging us we packed up our 5 kids and left. Not one server who we passed on our way out attempted to ask us what the issue was. So I pulled one to the  .express my discontent. Although she apologized and seemed sincere we felt our complaints fell on deaf ears.  THE WORST!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14
Xenia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,243,469,1.0,10/8/2017,"You know that feeling when you should listen to all the bad Yelp reviews, and don't go to a restaurant. Listen folks, the reviews for this Applebee's are spot on...take your money elsewhere.  I typically tend not to eat at chain restaurants. However, I couldn't help myself when I saw that Applebee's was doing a promotion for $1 margaritas for the month of October! Boy were my dreams crushed when I found out that this location isn't participating in the $1 margaritas specials.  After waiting 20 minutes, we decided to just eat there anyway. The service was awful. Literally, a bunch of different servers passed us and didn't even take our order for 10 minutes. The manager also has a horrible attitude.

Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,292,689,4.0,2/27/2017,"I thought I left a review before since I've frequented this location for so many years.  If you are looking for a quiet, g rated, or romantic night out.... this might not be your place.  This is more of a sports bar for locals than anything else, the crowd can be loud sometimes.  After work and happy hour crowds rule the roost, for sure.  This is a fun time place  Days are much calmer, Sundays are filled with the church people hungry after services.  Waitstaff can vary, but most are relaxed and polite.  Food is standard 'bees, consistently good.  Management is cool and the bartenders ROCK!!!!!  Try it out now you know what to expect",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14

Skyler L.,"Granada Hills, CA",54,11,6,1.0,6/17/2017,"I'm just going to go ahead and say it: every person working at this Applebee's needs to be fired. Don't even bother retraining the staff, start from scratch and rehire all of the positions. It might even be a better idea just to start a fire and let the building burn to the ground. Living in the neighborhood I've walked past this location multiple times, and I'll admit, every time I go by the place is always popping.  So when I finally went, naturally I assumed the popularity would make sense. Once we walked in, the woman at the front walked by multiple times but didn't seem to notice us or care. We stood waiting for five minutes to even be acknowledged. When we sat down, they didn't have any silverware rolled, and we were instead given silverware in a plastic glass of hot water. ??? I wouldn't even care about such shoddy innovation if everything else wasn't ALSO poor quality. I ordered the Caprese Mozzarella Burger because the photo online made it look very good. However, just as McDonald's flaunts photos of burgers that appear-not just at a standard that meets the term 'edible,' but 'good' dare I say... the food I was given was less than expected on multiple levels. My biggest issue with this is that everyone knows McDonald's advertises burgers but SERVES gray sludge painted to look like food, but with Applebee's? Really? This was by far the most flavorless burger I have ever had the displeasure of eating. I'm certain my napkin would have had a better flavor profile than what I was served. Ever heard of seasoning, Applebee's? For fuck's sake this is a black neighborhood and I'm left wondering who's white ass grandpa you've got chained to the grill back there working for pennies. On top of all of this, I asked for jalapeños to spice up what I expected to be a somewhat mild burger in terms of flavor due to the mild cheese they put on it. That last paragraph was just about the meat. Don't get it twisted, I knew what I was doing ordering a MOZZARELLA BURGER. I digress, the jalapeños took a long time to get to our table, which I asked for upon ordering, and we weren't updated about from our waiter... so I end up sitting there staring at this burger I had taken one bite out of that tasted like the flavorless liquid laxative you get from Walgreen's... watching it cool on my plate. Eventually the jalapeños arrived, RAW, which was disappointing since raw jalapeños also don't have much of a flavor profile as they are simply heat in your mouth, so way to go Applebee's. Then I ask for hot sauce and the only thing they have stocked is TOBASCO. Which, out of all the hot sauces out there, is the worst one. It should just be rebranded as a terrible vinegar. But at this point, I'm starving for both food, and any sort of flavor that my meal could provide. So naturally I drench the burger in tobasco and litter it with the raw jalapeños and start eating. At this point I'm starting to suffer a bit, the jalapeños being very spicy but adding nothing else of value to the meal, and it was too late to do anything other than cringe and recoil at my mistaken liberal use of that tobasco. So I'm downing my water, and where's the waiter to check on us? Probably down in the basement where this Applebee's forces their employees to do trivial laborious tasks during all down time. At least, that's my best assumption based on the vacant mental absence plastered on most of the employees faces. Eventually, I caught our waiter's attention, got more water, and then we had to catch him again later to get the check.  Lastly, the overall prices at Applebee's does not reflect the value you get in service, or food. This entire experience has left me shook. 1/5 would not recommend. But if you must go, I suggest wearing a ridiculous outfit so perhaps the staff will actually pay attention to you. Oh, and bring your own hot sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14

Stephen E.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",20,3,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Believe me I wish there was a half star option. Food looked like something drained the energy out of it. No better than a typical Delhi or McDonald's at best. Prices especially were rediculous and presentation/portions looked nothing like the very misleading menu.

Hence I kept my distance for a spell until the family wanted to go here for dinner. Getting there immediately I noticed a difference. It may not have been really busy but folks were actually working and not slacking off like I've seen previous visits. Hostess was very cordial and our server was very up point on the menu and drinks.

Anne W.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,180,138,2.0,9/22/2016,"This is the worst airport dinner I've ever had and I wasn't even at the airport.  I pass this Applebee's on the way to the grocery store, and recently jokingly suggested to my fiance that we eat here instead of cooking. He agreed. Alright, then.  We were seated in the bar area so that we could take advantage of the all night happy hour specials, which include discounted drinks and half off select appetizers.  He had a $4 Stella and I had a $4 glass of wine that tasted exactly like $4 wine.  We ended up doing the $27 special that came with 1 app and 2 entrees plus another app from the happy hour menu.  Appetizers: The spinach artichoke dip was great, but I've never had bad spinach artichoke dip.  The wonton chicken tacos were also super good. A little sweet from the teriyaki but the slaw on top was really nice.   Entrees: Butcher's Meat and Potatoes -- the meat was overcooked. Like, over over over cooked. The onion rings were extremely greasy. I did enjoy the mashed potatoes and the tomatoes, though.  Sirloin Stir Fry -- once again, the meat was so overcooked. No moisture left, hard to cut. Major disappointment. The rest of the dish tasted like a microwave meal that you settle for because you said you'd start bringing your lunch to work to save money but didn't feel like actually cooking.  The Service: This was actually probably the worst part of the meal. We never received water, it took over half an hour to order, and we received one of our apps after our entrees were half done. They have tablets on the table that allow you to request your server, but our requesrt was ignored for well over 10 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14

We had 5 dollar drinks and half-priced appetizers that hit the spot! In 2017, I have decided to eat a bit healthier and to make more conscious eating choices. Last month, I went to this Applebee's to get some lunch during my work day. The hostess/server was polite, pleasant and helpful as she explained healthy additions to their menu. She was infomed by me that I have to alter my diet and inquiries were made about simply prepared foods. After her carefully explaining and assuring me that I would get my order prepared in a healthy manner, I decided to order Grilled Chicken and Grilled Salmon (1 piece of each) without any sauce or extra seasoning with sides of vegetables. The food was delicious! I thanked her for ensuring that I had such a great and healthy meal option for lunch.

When they arrived they were half full, full of ice and not tasty.  We ordered chicken fingers and they came out almost an hour later with just 3 tenders and a child sized portion of fries which were cold.  But it costs $15. The manager was called because the waitress was of no help and she apologized and brought us out another dime sized portion of fries to supplement the 12 we had on our plate. You would think that it was packed to capacity. It was a Saturday afternoon and maybe 12 people were in the whole spot.  We were initially sitting outside but it began to rain and we asked to be moved inside. Again there were maybe 12 people in the whole spot. I'm rounding UP. We still needed to WAIT to find a place to sit. We eventually sat ourselves, and the hostess eventually said we could stay even though that was the section our waitress was working.  The duration of our stay at the restaurant was a hot mess. After repeatedly sending back drinks and food, the manager said she would fix the bill and we still had all the items on the check.

My problem though was mainly with the hostess. It's your job to seat us and let us know that we can indeed order from the table. Once we expressed to our waitress that we were waiting quite some time for her to come over, she seemed quite irritated and told us we could've ordered appetizers and drinks from the tablet on the table. A lot of attitude in the air that I wasn't in the mood to inhale and the service needs work. I can't lie to you though the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=20
Gigi C.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",37,79,227,2.0,1/31/2015,"I love Applebee's, I love Long Island locations better because they have superior customer service skills, unlike Brooklyn locations. I came here a year ago and had the worse service ever so I decided to never return. My daughter turned 13 today so she asked if we could drop in and due to frigid temperatures and not having a babysitter, I agreed to come here to give them a second chance.  We were seated quickly, we ordered quickly and our server was ok. He wasn't great because he never checked on us for a refill or to see how we were doing. Now the prices here are jacked up sky high. I was literally in Applebee's 3 weeks ago, ordered the same stuff but paid more at this location $25 more at that.  Our food came out missing sauce for the quesadilla and missing sour cream. My daughters chicken tenders didn't come with a dipping sauce either but we were unbothered by that. We ate our food and they sang Happy Birthday to my daughter which was nice. They charged us $1 for the Birthday Sundae, all other Applebee's give it for free. Clearly this location has no hospitality for their Birthday guest but it's whatever.  As we finished our food, we were given the bill and we weren't finished. Just like any franchise or establishment we visit, we get our full course meal. We had not ordered dessert for my daughters and myself. I told our waiter who did apologize and ripped the bill up and took down our dessert orders and left. He came back 10 mins later with it and it was good. We finished and we were happy, the bill was very high compared to other locations but the service was better this time around. They also make up this menu on their own as they do sell ""Jerk chicken"" at this location only. I can only assume that their prices are jacked up by management and not the franchise in its location alone! Better than our first time here but I won't be coming here again due to the prices on their menu and the changes they have on the menu unlike other Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=20
Brandon Z.,"New York, NY",0,12,14,1.0,6/23/2017,"I'm not one to write bad reviews but the service at this Applebee's is horrendous. I walked in the restaurant and waited 20 mins in front for a hostess because no one was at the counter. After waiting 20 mins I got annoyed and asked a server where is the hostess. He said ""she's coming back just hold on a sec"". I continued to wait this is after 20 mins already went by. Then she comes and totally ignores the people waiting. She proceeded to answer the phone and turn her back towards us. The server makes her aware people are behind her where she asks for the name of the party. I tell her the name and she's just staring at me. I was waiting for a buzzer or something like ""please step aside sir we will call you up"". Instead I had to ask her um how do I know when my table is ready. She responded I'll call you when your party is ready. So I'm thinking hey I'm get a table in a few minutes because tables were being clean off and there was empty seating. Instead they had multiple parties wait for 10-20 mins for a table that never had anyone there since we entered the restaurant. At this point I was getting aggravated that there was seating available but they were not utilizing them. I'm not one of those people who think when I entered a restaurant everything needs to be catered to me but this was ridiculous. There was empty seating and no one was being seated. Instead we waited for a booth that was open since I arrived there. The server was okay. His service at first sucked because I told him we don't know what we want to eat yet and he walked away. So I stopped him and said I know what I want for drinks. I ordered a orange soda which was like water. The server later became very prompt on asking if everything was okay and if he could get us anything but by then I just wanted to pay the bill to get out of there. I ordered the lemon chicken with raisin rice. The food definitely wasn't worth it. I took about two bites because the food tasted like a frozen TV dinner. It had no taste what so ever.  I will say this won't be my last time going to Applebee's but definitely my last time going to this specific one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=20

Shanice P.,"New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2017,"My daughters, cousin, and I stopped in this location for a bite to eat following a festival this weekend. There were several issues here regarding our menu choices that we required the manager to resolve. Because she was so standoffish, and RUDE, all of the issues didn't get addressed. I was able to explain one of our biggest issues, however, to which she reluctantly agreed to give us ""a little off"" of the bill (her words, not mine). This wasn't offered, but had to be requested by us after a detailed explanation of what was wrong. Upon receiving the bill and seeing what ""a little off"" was, we asked for her again to inquire as to if we could just have the entire newly ordered entree removed (it was 15.99, and we were given $10 off). We were all taken aback by a discourteous, reluctant and unfriendly ""ok, I'll take off the $5.99"" before she walked off without another word. The waiter Jabari, was friendly, and tried his best in spite of him being new, and still grasping onto everything. The manager, could have been more approachable in her demeanor, especially knowing that she had a new waiter on the floor who may have required a bit more assistance in making certain that the customer service was sufficiently fulfilled. She was the worst, and made the experience one none of my party will soon forget.  No more Fulton street Applebee's for us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=40

I felt it was a good step in the direction of better neighborhood. My son graduation was Tuesday June 24th at 9 am. My family and I decided to have a celebratory lunch at this restaurant. Unfortunately this wasn't a good experience for us. Upon entering the building we were met with a foul smell when asked the hostess about it she stated it was chicken but I wouldn't smell it when I'm seated. The smell was so strong as if you were in a meat department. Never the less we continue to be seated due to the fact of pleasant experience I've always had. We were seated at 11:03 but we didn't have our complete party therefore we only ordered Appetizer and beverages. The rest of my party arrived at 11:33 then we proceeded to order our entrees. At 12:27 we still have not received our food. We expressed our concern to the waitress and she said it was coming. After about 10 minutes we asked for a manager. We also asked two other staff members for a manger as well the manger still didn't come out. When I stopped one of the workers his immediate response was your food was coming. At that present moment I felt uncomfortable to consume any food. After 10 minutes and several request for the manger she finally graced us with her presence. We explained the situation and she immediately said you didn't order as soon as you were seated. I answered that was correct but we did order at 11:30 am it is now 12:27 p.m. we should've had our food by now. Then she (Manager) said that the kitchen was backed up. Her whole attitude verbally and her body language was disturbing. She didn't show any type of professionalism at all and I thank God that I wasn't ignorant because it could've gotten very ugly. She wasn't apologetic at all and didn't show any concerned towards the situation. I did request for the food to be bagged up at this time it was 12:45 now. It took another 10 minutes for the food to come out. I did tell the waitress I didn't want the food but yet they bought any way.  The waitress and the manger bought the food out and when I told them we didn't want it the manger sucked her teeth and swung herself around. We had to wait another 10 minutes for the receipt. When we walked out my son notice that the manger gave me a nasty look I mean really. The manger needs to learn better customer service skills. I was disappointed, frustrated and hungry. What a bad way to end my son's graduation. This experience deters me from entering 1360 Fulton St. Applebees as long as she's a manager. I love your food, drinks and came across very nice waitresses and mangers throughout the many years I've been supporting this venue Thank you in Advance  Madeline D.

We ignored her and called for a manager instead.  The manger apologized profusely and took the steak back to the kitchen. When we tried to pay for our awful meal and experience Christelle did not know how to ring us up with the automated machine that is attached to each table in the restaurant.   She made several mistakes with our bill and gave herself a 20 percent tip. She didn't know how to fix the bill and started to ask us questions on how to pay the bill.  We had to remind Christelle that WE did not work for Applebee's and WE could not fix the bill.  Again, we had to contact the manager who had to fix our bill.

I would rather go to Red Lobster instead - so much better. PROS: -Deal for 2 entrees plus 1 appetizer for $26 - Honey Buffalo Wings (appetizer) was the only decent thing ate from here. CONS: - received an UNCLEAN menu with sticky sauce all over the front page and my hand accidentally grazed - disgusting. They should at least clean the menus before giving it to the customers. - tried their new SIZZLING ASIAN SHRIMP (spicy). NOT GOOD. basically everything was boiled and they dumped the spicy sauce in the middle with a some crunchy pieces on the top. SO not worth the MONEY. I was basically full from drinking water most of the time. - slow service. (took forever for them to give us the food and give us our bills) - We had to pay 17% gratuity for 7 people - that's a lot considering the service they presented us with.

No?   :/ And I'm sorry - but I MUST comment on the obnoxious and presumptuous contribution of the reviewer below me.  In case you live under a rock and aren't aware - comments like this: It is like being at an Applebee's where the staff and the customers are from Crown Heights and Bed Stuy.  are extremely rude and stereotypical.  And please don't think that because you were attempting to be vague, that your point didn't come across loud and clear.   I'd venture a guess that you are rarely in bedstuy or crown heights, or recently moved there with all the rest of the new ""entitled"" neighbors I've been encountering more recently.  You don't belong in Bed Stuy.  You certainly don't belong there making judgments about the quality of service based on your personal perception of what the usual residents of the area are capable of in terms of providing a decent service.  There are many restaurants in Bed Stuy, run not by a corporation, but by individuals who actually live in, work in, and care about the community, that offer wonderful service and are made up of all the same ""staff and customers...from Bed Stuy and Crown Heights.""   So watch your mouth, Becky.  If you have criticisms of the neighborhood there's always Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights conveniently priced for people like you.  Bon Voyage!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=60

My how things have changed and not for the better.  Since they've been under new management I've had some of the worst dining experiences: I. Went in for lunch and they had NO RUNNING WATER.  Applebees, why are you open and serving people?  How is your staff washing dishes or their hands for that matter? Let's not even think about what's going on in the restroom . . . Completely unsanitary. -exit stage left- II. On a different occasion I was seated by the hostess but waited for my waiter for close to 25 mins without so much as a greeting or acknowledgement. I was so annoyed I left and haven't been back until . . .  III. My visit last week -sighs-  -  The food came before my drink, (that shouldn't happen, ever!) -  My appetizer was burnt. -  I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and got what can only be described as some sort of overly sweetened carbonated lemon lime soda? -blank stare . . . blinks-  Immediately I call the waiter over and she tells me she cannot exchange my drink but instead she can offer me a shot, for $2. If the LI was short on alcohol I still wouldn't have obliged, the drink was just BAD-- there isn't a shot on this earth that could have saved it. I asked to speak to the manger, explained how horrid the drink was, and he exchanged it as he should have. Honestly I'm pretty much over Applebees in general (I caught a waiter drinking my drink at the Flatbush Ext. location. Then he served it to me. That pretty much turned me off from there as well. . . but that's another review).

Anubis K.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,149,138,1.0,8/17/2011,"Well what can I say about this place, the service is terrible, long waits for something very simple as a burger, they conveniently sat us down at the bar just so we'd buy drinks but luckily I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I know all about these laughable tactics, of course I did not buy anything to drink so from what I observed none of these people even knows the meaning of being a mixologist, there was quite a lot of flies, the bar area was very dirty and sticky, all of the girls were wearing very revealing clothing but yet I could see anyone that was even remotely cute or at least half passable, they were all out of shape with their excess belly fat hanging over their extremely tight pants, waited 45 minutes for my food to arrive, when their is a standard knowledge that if a person is not staying their food has to be expedited and given preference over seated guest ho are buying drinks but yet for odd reason they choose to do it a bit different here, hosted obviously told the kitchen to hold food as a for of punishment, but not surprisingly just as I was about leave she rushes in the back gets the food comes back smiling and saying see I went all the way in to get it just for you, I said well that's great but do not for a minute assume that you are getting any tip, boy did she get really angry :) the burger was very cold and not enjoyable at all since the bun was already hardened only ate because of hunger and feeling lazy to get in the kitchen today as far as i am concerned everyone here needs to be fired should have never been hired to begin with in the first place they're all very lazy and disgusting does not seem they've been anything about wasting your hands after using the toilet the one bartender was changing from her work attire and shows all the while she was busy serving over filled beer a number people had to shout and yell in order to get some service the other bartender was scratching her ass and brushing her hair as well as chewing on gum right over the shot she was making for another lady then they have these two security guards men that quite in my opinion really do not serve any purpose as they are not armed with any sort of weaponry so if they are trying to deter an armed robbery they've failed in that task some the staff became very angry because my cousin was laughing about the poor level of service or I should say lack of service but they quickly realized that there was absolutely nothing at all that they could do about it :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=100

John E. S.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,23,2,1.0,10/2/2011,"You know, I'm not a big Applebees fan, but my gf and I decided what the hell, lets try it. We're new to the neighborhood, its a chain, tons of black folk like it, we couldn't go that wrong right? Wrong,when we walked in we were greeted by the most inhospitable host of all time, he barely even said hi to us. When he sat us he put us in the first booth, which was fine until we were ignored by our server for the remainder of our time there. We sat for a total of ten minutes without water or even a hello from our server. She tended to every table but ours. The best part was that the machine where you put in food orders was right next to our table, so its not like it was a stretch for her to get to us. To her credit, when she saw us looking around, she said she'd be right with us and continued to tend to other tables in crazily slow manner, almost slothlike. We finally got up after the manager had walked by three times to drop off food to other tables. Not to sound like a bigot or a closeminded jerk but if we were another black family picking up lunch on a saturday we would have at least been given glasses of water. This was probably the worst and rudest experience i've ever had anywhere, i'm never going back, not even for takeout. I'll probably recommed the same for my friends. Bad job Crapplebees of Bed Stuy, I thought u were bigger than that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=100
Aislinn H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,56,,3.0,6/9/2009,"It's an Applebee's people not the Taj Mahal.  Applebee's is a big hangover staple at my apartment and as the only place around that definitely accepts cards(lets face it, we spent all our cash on booze) it's a pretty good option.  Fried food, big platters, ginormous glasses of soda.  Sure, the service is crap and the food quality isn't great, but when I need a gallon of coke and a plate of fried goodness to cure my hangover, it does the trick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=100
Joshua U.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",62,27,3,3.0,12/29/2009,"Slowest service ever. But the food was fine. I mean, it's Applebees. I got exactly what I expected, although I got it really slowly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=100
Gary S.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,21,3,2.0,2/3/2011,"I went here on a Wednesday around 5 -6 PM was seated at the Bar ,but choose a booth instead because I was with my two brother,Jerome and Aqiyl  a casual night with Brothers only to get a bite to eat, wings and check out the single ladies after-work crowd. The service was prompt the wings good (but not fully cooked I see why they have Dim lights to masquerade the rush on food being not fully done.) at one point we actually had to summons a waiter to find our host who been gone a good hour. The Bar crowd was pretty rowdy and loud but we understood their excitement ,because we was of the same kind before, guys night out no hold bar Next time I'm gonna request extra  crispy but not burnt to get the wings the way I like them. I visit other places in my food travel that stick a thermometer in the cooked chicken and actually cut one open to make sure  that they are done fully before serving to the public. The very last being that I know the business do I must ask for a drink with no Ice, to don't get a drink saturated with Ice to keep the cost down...........",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=100
Koku K.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,219,91,4.0,11/20/2007,"I love this Applebee's!  It's on the corner of Fulton and New York in the Restoration Plaza, and they have a great happy hour special! Monday-Friday from 4-7pm there are half priced appetizers & drink specials, and Monday-Thursday from 10pm - close they have the same specials as the happy hour.  You can't beat sitting at the bar here.  Some days are more crowded than others, but as of late it's been pretty low key.  I'm a hardcore regular lol.  It's hard to stay away from the mozzarella sticks. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=100
swamee p.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,,2.0,2/16/2011,very tacky service -- Also they're happy hour is inferior to those in white neighborhoods. the food is cold and the wait for service is long...better to cook at home!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-14?start=100
