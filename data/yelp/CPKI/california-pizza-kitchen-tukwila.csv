Maggie S.,"Seattle, WA",1,24,31,4.0,8/23/2017,"I am a fan of Ma' & Pa' pizza places so I was not excited to try a chain pizza restaurant, but from the moment I sat down I was impressed with California Pizza Kitchen. The menu is huge and delicious looking. The staff at this particular place was very friendly. After sitting down, the manager came out with a free app, insisting we try their guacamole and chips on the house since it was our first time in! It was fantastic. The worst part of the whole experience was trying to pick only one thing to order for myself.  Once we ordered, they brought out delicious  free bread and amazing oil for dipping. They were also very helpful with my mother-in-law's food allergies. She ordered a Margarita Pizza, while my partner and I shared the Sicilian Pizza and the California Salad.  I am giving them 4/5 stars only because I didn't think my salad was worth menu price at $16.00. I have had better salads for less. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but $16.00 is too much for a salad. For all three of us, the bill came to about $50 without any drinks. Which is a little high, but also take into consideration that this is really close to Seattle. **but this location was not in Seattle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila
Kevin K.,"Lynden, WA",28,16,4,4.0,12/28/2017,"CPK is always a solid choice. The menu includes soups, salads, sandwiches, and of course, pizza. The menu includes a new two option lunch for a little under nine dollars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila

Dee C.,"Port Orchard, WA",80,45,56,4.0,6/3/2017,"It's been awhile since I've been to CPK, actually since I've been home in Hawaii. It's always been my favorite place to dine and because we were at Westfield mall, we decided to stop in. Surprisingly it wasnt busy for a holiday since there wasn't any wait so we were seated almost immediately.  Our server , i believe his name was Evan, provided such awesome service and Always made sure we were helped.  I ordered my usual, garlic cream fettuccine with shrimp as well as spinach artichoke dip. My fiancé ordered a lettuce wrap and a pizza. CPK never seems to fail when it comes to their pastas and dip. They offer a wide variety of appetizers, salads pastas and pizzas.  I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet. It's such a bummer they don't have many locations open in different cities of WA considering the 4 stars given, I'm sure they'd have more business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila

Kelly S.,"Renton, WA",202,21,31,5.0,3/12/2017,"First time here, and there was a lot of people so the wait was about 20 mins if we wanted a table or a booth but if we didn't want to wait and just go straight to the counter we could, so we did so!  The kitchen was a little backed up and our server did what he can so we can get our food! He was super friendly and up beat! He gave us one of the best service so we tipped him pretty nice!  I got the roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken breast, super yummy and the dressing I believe tasted like balsamic vinegar.  My boyfriend got the ""The works"" pizza basically just everything on a pizza, red onions, olives, green bell peppers, pepperoni and all the good stuff.  10/10 would recommend if you want a nice place to dine with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila

Tim M.,"Tacoma, WA",3,98,21,3.0,5/23/2017,"My first experience with the CPK chain. This is one of those places I've been meaning to try for a very long time but just never found myself in the right ""location"" to make it happen. First, let me say that the place was EXTREMELY loud. I'm not sure how anyone could have a conversation in here. I know my fellow diner and I really couldn't. It was that loud. Just WAY too loud. I'm not real sure why, but it's a VERY loud space that does not attribute to any conversation at normal volume levels. I'll follow that up with this: Upon being greeted by the hostess, I inquired about sitting outside since it was the first sunny day we've had in the Seattle area in something like 8 years or whatever (It may not have been 8 years, but it sure feels like it. If you've been here, you know.). She informed me that she could not seat us outside because there was only one server working that area and, I quote - ""She's pretty stressed out right now."" :-/ Fine, whatever, just give me a table in this venue with the volume levels of a rock concert. Based on those two items alone, I'm not sure I'll be returning here any time soon. I give it a 3 star rating because the food was okay. Granted, I didn't order a pizza, even though that is the namesake. But they do offer a lot more than just pizzas. I wouldn't call the food great, but it wasn't bad either. Not sure I'm really a fan. I think I can find other dining options that are better than this at this price point. Your mileage may vary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila
Ryo C.,"Seattle, WA",2,13,261,2.0,3/20/2017,"It has been awhile since visiting California Pizza Kitchen, and thanks to Elizabeth (the ""manager"" at the time) I probably won't be back for quite some time. My mom wanted to go here for her birthday. I can think of other places I would rather go for a birthday, but it was her birthday. We walk in and get greeted by the hostess. We are then greeted by Elizabeth who proceeded to show us to our table. Enroute to our table my Mom asked if our party of four could sit at the corner booth. Elizabeth was quick to say, ""No, I'm sorry but corner booths are for parties of five."" Mind you, this was during a week day. They were not busy, but I took her word for it. Being it's my Mom's birthday I was a bit irritated so I said, ""Maybe we bring five people on your next birthday."" Before walking away Elizabeth says, ""Oh, happy birthday."" We sit down and get settled in to look at our menus. This whole time while looking at the menu I periodically look around the restaurant and I eventually notice a family of four sitting in a corner booth. I tried not to be too obvious, but I kept looking over to see if there was a small child in the party, or maybe someone happened to be using the restroom when I initially looked over there. Time passes and I realize it's just a party of four in a corner booth. I think to myself, ""Okay, maybe the corner booth we requested is their last booth to seat a party of five."" Though there are several tables that have five chairs and place settings for parties of five. We eventually decide on meal choices and place our orders, and while we wait the nice hostess that initially greeted us walks by with a party of four. I turn to see where this party of four is being seated, lo and behold they get seated in the corner booth my Mom requested. At this point I am upset and plan on talking with Elizabeth before leaving to express my displeasure.  We eventually get our food, which was okay, nothing special. My mom got the Thai Salad that she was craving, my better half got a salad and Mac & Cheese, our little girl a Pepperoni Pizza, and I got the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Again, the food was okay. I have nothing bad to say about the quality of our meal. As we are leaving my Mom tells me that she would like to talk with Elizabeth. I think Mom could tell I was quite upset, and chose to be the one to voice our dissatisfaction. We walk to the front and ask the hostess if we could speak to the manager Elizabeth. She said she would get her right away. As Elizabeth walks over toward the front my Mom confronts her, they exchange words and they then part ways. I asked​ my mom what was said. My mom then told me that she told Elizabeth that we noticed other parties of four that were seated in the corner booths, and that we were unhappy with being told one thing and seeing another. My Mom then told me that the only thing Elizabeth said about our concern was, ""I understand."" I truly hope she ""understands"" that she could have made my Mom's birthday dinner better by either letting her sit in that corner booth, or at least be consistent when saying, ""the corner booths are for parties of five."" Or, just a simple ""I'm sorry"" would have been nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila

The lady in the front welcomed and addressed us quickly and before we even sat down, our waiter Kado got to us. The service is 5 stars. The food was decent and was fulfilling. I tried the new garlic chicken pizza. It was fresh, had a crispy touch to it and had a little sweet side to it. The chicken wasn't too tender and was juicy.  I had 3 slices of pizza (half of the whole pizza) and took the rest home where my mom and dad snacked on the rest. My dad said the pizza was better than most places he tried and my mom tried a slice (she normally doesn't eat pizza).  I hear that the desserts here are delicious.

This experience was a huge improvement over their carry out service. The service was attentive and friendly. No mistakes were made and we were able to get in and out in a timely manner.

I had to sit there and question what the heck it was, because i don't eat cheese, and thank the lord it wasn't but i was very frustrated.  Whats even worse was.. a different server had to come help too, i think she was getting mad because she saw how pissed off i was, and how the service was so bad for me. Nikki finally came back with my check, but i already had it....

BBQ pizza here is my favorite and my boyfriend loved it too. I love Cobb salads but I wasn't so happy with theirs. I ordered a half size which honestly wasn't worth the price for the size or quality. My bacon was just one piece cut into 3. I typically like my Cobb salads to have pieces of bacon bits, and the egg was so crumbly. It was almost non existent in my salad. The size was not much bigger than a side salad but literally only 2 or 3 dollars less than a full sized salad. I also had the avacado eggrolls which were too oily.

I go in and there wasn't anyone in the waiting area, the place wasn't even full and she told me to wait, which was fine. Well I waited longer than expected for a place that was not busy at the moment. Once she came to back she asked if I wanted to sit indoor or outside, and I said indoor, she then grabbed the menus and walked off, she didn't even say a word. So the other guy who was there don't remember his name it started with K, said ""oh, I think she means to follow her"" and well I responded with, ""well she didn't say anything to me"". She literally just walked away.  Once I got seated she didn't even make eye contact and didn't say anything until I said thank you. The other waiter ""K"" came and apologized saying its her fist time out on the floor and she is usually in the kitchen. So sweet of him to try to cover for her, but I think it was BS, I didn't buy it at all.   ""K"" took over after that which was good, because the other one looked she was not having a good day or something. He took care of us which was good and the food was really tasty, I got the chicken chimichuri, and didn't even get a chance to take a picture because I got a call about a family emergency.

My favorite pizza is made right here, California club topped with arugula and avocado. One of the few chains that I really like. This specific franchise... Not so much!!  It all started 10-15 minutes after our server took our order, when we noticed everyone else was having bread and butter on their table but us! Once our food was served, I asked our server if there is any bread and butter and she simply stated that she did not feel the need to get us one because we already knew what we wanted to order! She then said she could still get us one; right after, she went to another table to take their order and spent the next 15 minutes chatting with them. We were done with our food by the time she got back to our table and asked us if we were still interested in bread and butter! This has probably been the worst service I have received in a while, the reason being that she carelessly shrugged her shoulders as if it was not her job to attend to our needs.

You know when you reheat day old pizza in the microwave and the crust is a little chewy?  The crust here was so CHEWY and TOUGH my jaw hurt after 3 slices. It was like gnawing on an overcooked steak. I don't think these pizzas are fresh at all. I expect them to be frozen and reheated. Our party ordered 3 pizzas meat trio, pepperoni, and Hawaiian. All 3 were the same consistency and prices were $10+ for each pizza! The only thing that saved this place from a 1 star review is the avocado egg rolls (they were ok) and the service.

Charlie W.,"Seattle, WA",3,33,4,3.0,1/26/2015,"I once spent a week in Paris on a generous per diem and, among other things, ate my way through a series of restaurants in the Latin Quarter and St-Germain-des-Pres.   Even when the food was unexceptional, the service seemed remarkable for constant attentiveness to patrons and their needs. Why do I bring this up?  Well, for some reason, American corporate chain restaurants--capable as they sometimes are of delivering exceptional values--often fail abysmally in hospitality. Here the restaurant was only two-thirds full, but there was still a ten-minute wait to be seated--caused in part by a lineup of families at the door.  When the host finally walked me over to a booth, he simply tossed the menu onto the table top and walked away.   To my surprise, when I put my hand down to pick up the menu, it came up smeared with oil.  No one had bothered to wipe the table top.  And too bad I didn't bring a dog with me, because there was enough food on the floor beneath the table for a second meal. Perhaps serving jobs are made too easy nowadays.  Maybe they've been broken down into smaller and smaller domains of responsibility--like a Japanese department store with more attendants than shoppers.  I mean, something must account for the dismal boredom that I repeatedly encounter in the serving staff in such places. To be fair, the food at Tukwila California Pizza Kitchen was okay.  I had a half Caesar salad and a Margherita thin-crust pizza, which, along with a bottomless soda and a 20% tip, came to $30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=40

Every time I come here, (normally in the evenings on a Friday or Saturday), there is hardly ever a wait! If anything, we would have to wait for less than 5 minutes. Which is a major bonus because who likes waiting for more than 15mins to get seated on the weekend after a long week? The people up front are always very nice and greet us when we enter and leave. But as for waiters, it's a hit or miss. Last week, was a bad experience which was such a disappoint. After we were seated, it took our waiter about 10 minutes to come to our table and finally get our drinks by that point we were already ready to order. He didn't really have an explanation or apologize for the wait (which I think is a bit rude). The last few times we have came we have gotten complimentary bread and this time we didn't. But the table next to us did? Hmm...  Once we got our food, he didn't check on us at all throughout our dinner. When we asked for our checked, he had it ready already. Hmm... what if we wanted dessert? I don't know but I really did not like the waiter that we had.

Their menu has a wide variety of flavors and dishes- some I think are kind of ridiculous at a pizza place but I think their frequent customers see nothing ridiculous about Asian fusion appetizers...aaat a Pizza place.   Sure I get adding a little eastern flavor to the pizza or salad but I'm not a faddy person.  Not that I wouldn't try it to give them a chance-nor do I mean to condemn them in anyway for it.  Most of it sounds delicious.  A lot of the fun there is trying new things so it was pretty darn smart of them to have a gigantor menu. But lest ladies of a certain age or just the age defyingly persnickety get their napkins in a bunch let us have some perspective: this will be like Olive Garden in 10 years if it lasts that long.

Bon Vivan T.,"Bend, OR",24,107,30,2.0,3/20/2010,"Summary:  normally one of the best in their chain - not the case with our last visit. I'm attaching the customer feedback that I just submitted to CPK's website - while not a typical review, it does describe our dining experience last night.  Hopefully, they will take steps to correct the problems we encountered. -- My wife and I visited the CPK in Tukwila, WA (our sixth or seventh visit to this particular location) yesterday.  We were seated quickly, however our table was situated in a location where the sun shifted to shine directly in my eyes.  When asked, the waiter quickly moved us to a more comfortable location - so far, so good.  We asked for bread, placed our drink orders, and started deciding on appetizers, dinner, etc.  When the waiter returned to take our order, we still hadn't decided, so we ordered appetizers.  He came back around in about a minute or two, and asked if we were ready, so we placed our order for cups of soup and main courses.  After a fair wait, our appetizers showed up, along with the bread we had requested, and our soup. I had literally taken two (2) sips of soup and hadn't even touched to appetizer, when a server showed up, crowding our table with our main course.  I'm sorry, but we didn't go to McDonald's.  If I would have wanted everything at once, I would have gone somewhere where the food is served in a trough.  If it isn't clear, this is one of my main pet peeves at a restaurant - and the reason why I normally won't give a server my main course order until my appetizer or soup or salad is done.  When brought to the attention of the manager, she made things right by offering to re-make our dinner after we'd enjoyed our appetizers and soup, but then went on to explain that they don't ""turn and burn"" tables (exactly what they were doing), and that our waiter was very good (he was only fair).  We've had other dining experiences at this exact restaurant that were far superior to that we experienced last night. We will come back, but another experience like this will certainly make us re-consider our decision to drive past the Bellevue, WA CPK in favor of this location.  Please, take steps to educate your staff that dining out isn't so much a process of jamming the most chow in your face as quickly as possible, as it is a time to be enjoyed with friends and family.  When we come back, we'll be watching for the improvements you're sure to make.

gareth m.,"Phoenix, AZ",213,51,3,4.0,11/16/2008,"Recently I had the chance to dine at the California Pizza Kitchen in Tukwila Washington. My wife and I had attempted to dine at and review the restaurant on Oct 31st but were turned away despite being in the restaurant an hour before closing time. When I voiced my concerns online, I was surprised to get a call that day, (Saturday) from a manager at the locale. The manager explained that they were closing due to a slow night, but had to stay open longer to accommodate a small party. He also said he was sorry for the confusion and promised to send us some certificates. Now over two weeks and one follow up e-mail later, we are still waiting for the promised certificates that I now suspect will not arrive. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the hostess and told it would be about a ten minute wait. After waiting, we arrived at our table and were pleased by the décor of the restaurant. I noted that the kitchen staff (Which could be seen from the dining room), seemed to really be in a good mood and were really staying busy. Unsure which pizza to get I asked our server for advise as we ordered our Iced Teas. After some debate, we went with the BBQ Pizza and Spaghetti Bolognese with Mushrooms.  The pizza was wonderful as the signature pizza was on a handmade crust with BBQ sauce, onions, and two types of cheese (Gorgonzola and Mozzarella). The pasta was served aldente and the sauce and mushrooms were a great combination. Prior to ordering, I noted that aside from pizza and pasta, there were many other dining options ranging from salads to meat dishes, which made the choice difficult. The California Pizza Kitchen lists on the menu that they would like customers to be adventurous and if they order something they do not like, then they can substitute it for something else without charge. After the nice dinner, we were pressed for time and ordered dessert to go. After looking over the nice menu options we decided on a Red Velvet Cake that later turned out to be a very good idea as it not only travelled well, but was as good as it looked on the menu. The final total for our evening was $42.00 which made the prices comparable to dining experiences such as The Cheesecake Factory, and Claim Jumpers.

Rey M.,"Seattle, WA",6,64,,4.0,7/2/2010,"It took me years till I finally stepped in this pizza chain. Actually this locale has only been here for a few years, but that big yellow building in Bellevue has been around for awhile. It just never really drew me in. Never really thing of pizza when in the East Side. Most my Pizza eating is done in Seattle.  Here is what I have to say:  Love the Pizzas! Hate the Bar! and Yellow hurts my eyes!          The wide arrangement of Pizzas are very fun to choose from. A wide variety of selcetions there are always something on menu you will not find anywhere else. That's California for you. I have not had one bad pie yet and been here about 5 times in the last 6 months. Also whats really good are some of the small plates. From the Mediterranean plates to our favorite Arugula Asparagus Salad, you cant go wrong with the selections. Let me also add that the Clam pasta here is amazing! Also leave room for Desert. I recommend the Tirumisu. Very hearty portion :)  Overall its a great place to take your family after a day of shopping from the Mall across the street. I normally don't go to Restaurant Chains but must make an exception to this place. Only gripe is the Bar set up is no good. Only 1 TV and its on the End. You'll see it when you walk in. Also Curve pick up is a joke. Have done 3 take outs and they never bring out anything on time. Average wait 10 Minutes. At least for me.  A little secret here: They offer complimentary Bread with Oil and Balsamic. They just wont offer it to you. Never had it brought to me once.

I'd never been to one before. California & pizza together conjured odd visions of not-meat pizzas, and as an ex-New Yorker, that didn't sound so appealing. However the GF whined so I took her. And yes, their menu had all types of funky pizzas on it. But they also had a picatta, which turned out to be very tasty. I was just incredibly surprised that dinner for 2 with 2 drinks each landed me a $70 tab. Each beer was something like $12. And we're not talking artisan beers here, that was for a corona. So yeah, next time she whines for this restaurant, it's not happening, because no way in hell was that meal worth $70. Half that would have been about right. They must be overcharging for the name, I guess; I can't imagine why else. Also, if you use a GPS to get there (because this wasn't local for me), be aware that Google navigation thinks this place is 7 blocks away in the middle of a warehouse district.

Then our server shows up and it's not the person she had pointed out earlier. Andy was really nice and apologized for the wait, which was not his fault because he just got on shift. We ordered our food, Kung pao spaghetti fettuccine with mushrooms and a BBQ chopped salad. Our salad comes and I had to ask for bread, really!! The bread came with and herb oil which tastes bitter so I had asked for butter, then our pasta comes out, and my Kung pao was great, but my husbands pasta was not cooked fully, still very hard in the center, and the cream sauce was non existence!!! We sent it back and decided not to order another dish. It was so disappointing! Then the executive chef came out to apologize and offered us a free dessert, he was really nice and understanding. The staff on the other hand is a different story! They need to go back and start their training, I have never been to a cpk that has this bad of service, and they weren't busy at all!

OMG, I was in heaven. Since I had it last, they made slight adjustments to the tostada pizza, that made it even better. It is a thin crust pizza/with a salad on top. Brilliant. The BBQ chicken pizza had the right amount of BBQ sauce, and plenty of chicken, which made it a great choice.  We usually order the Tiramisu bc it is simply amazing, but the waitress convinced us to try one of their seasonal desserts...salted caramel pudding.

If you're into desserts, try the tiramisu or butter cake!! Totally worth it... just make sure to plan a few extra hours at the gym!  My only complaint is about the prices! CPK is expensive for what it is!! I'd say on average you should expect to spend $20-$25 per person... add some adult beverages and an appetizer to that, and your looking at $30-$35 easy.  P.S.

Their pizza with black beans and tortilla strips is surprisingly good and was actually way better than the one I tried with pepperoni and black olives. The dessert is a pretty high quality number, as well. We tried some sort of molten chocolate cake that was actually better than the pizza.

Edwin M.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,5/3/2016,I been going here for a few mouths now but when I went yesterday with my friend I didn't like how the sever treated us. first the sever asked us for our drinks and when he came back he just the throw the straw. we order and everything the food was great like always. When we ask for the checked I gave him my card and when he saw the card ans he asked for an id who asked for an id in restaurant. he didn't asked for a id to another of the table. why only because we are Latino? I felt discrimination,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Kevin S.,"Ashburn, VA",120,703,414,4.0,7/22/2012,"I absolutely LOVE CPK.  We miss living near CPK because my family and I love their pizza and salads.  We took advantage of a trip to the airport to stop and have dinner here at the CPK near SEATAC, and it was a real treat.   I would rate this CPK above average in comparison to other CPKs.  The food is always extraordinary, the service at other locations can sometimes be a little lackluster.  However, the service we received here at the South Center CPK was friendly, enthusiastic, prompt, and professional.   A couple of years ago I was devastated when they took my favorite pizza off the menu (the carne asada pizza), but CPK has redeemed themselves with the new carnitas pizza with habanero salsa.  It was fantastic! I wish there were a CPK over in Kitsap County.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Alaina W.,"Kent, WA",345,506,89,4.0,12/28/2013,"This is one of my go-to spots for dinner when shopping or being in or around the Tukwila area.  There's nothing exceptional about the decor or the service (and they're both northing to scoff at, either) but what I come for is the food. In fact, if they served the same food out of a vending machine, I'd be just as likely to return.  My usuals are the Margherita pizza and the Thai crunch salad. I think I've branched out once to have the pear gorgonzola pizza... maybe.  I'll be back, whether I'm served by a man or a machine. Just give me my pizza & salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Monty H.,"West Seattle, Seattle, WA",40,45,56,3.0,1/10/2014,Stopped in for lunch here with a friend. First off I want to say that the staff here are very friendly! They constantly checked on us and kept refilling our drinks. The manager even came by to ensure we were having a pleasant time. The atmosphere was good and I like the open kitchen layout. I so wanted to give this place a 4 but because the pizza was so standard I had to give it a 3. The crust is decent but the pizza had very little to no cheese. The sauce was just ok and the toppings were average. I will come back eventually but I think I will have to give it some time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60

Corinne M.,"Tacoma, WA",488,532,119,3.0,11/8/2013,"Came in maybe two weeks ago, with the family.  The pizza was awesome, and super good; the salads were decent, but overloaded on red onions; and the fried/breaded mac and cheese bites were so so, my kids loved them, but they were slightly warm at best, and so I didn't like them. The food was well worth 4 stars, but our overall experience was not.  Our server acted like she didn't want to be there at all; she took my menu away from me while I WAS STILL ORDERING, because apparently since we'd NEVER been there, and I was having a slightly hard time deciding what I wanted, meant that we must have just put her out of her way so much, because I needed one extra minute to order. She had the attitude of  someone who was just there because they had to be, not because they wanted to be. Maybe someone can tell me if it's really that bad of a place to work at, because feeling welcomed was non-existent.  The food was good, but the service needs a lot of help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Vanessa V.,"Auburn, WA",13,111,41,3.0,9/21/2015,It was a Saturday night and everywhere else had a 30-45 min wait. So we decided to stop here as everyone likes pizza and pasta. I had the salmon peach glazed salad. It was really good. On the same level as panera bread's salads. There was plenty of seating and the ambiance was family friendly. I don't know if I'd go back since it wasn't anything that rocked my socks haha,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Amy K.,"Lynnwood, WA",12,58,,1.0,3/13/2014,"It's probably not a good sign when your experience is so bad that you're inspired to write a review a month later, (I wasn't reviewing much at the time of service.) Stopped in for lunch with my husband and three year old. My husband an I used to frequent CPK when we lived in Houston, and even ate at this location when we first arrived in the area in 2011 because we considered it a good, safe choice, (as in got off of the plane moving up here and stopped at this CPK.) If this were my first CPK experience I would NOT be visiting any location again.  As is, I'll be avoiding this location. Everything was wrong. Our appetizer never came out, and I had to ask for the manager to have it taken off of our bill. No refills, and mostly absent waiter.   I left the restaurant angry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Lauren H.,"Renton, WA",9,21,,5.0,10/11/2013,"I had to come straight home and write a review from my great experience.  I am lactose intolerant, sadly, so my poor fiance doesn't get to have pizza very often. He's nice enough where he opts for a restaurant that isn't mainly something I can't have. I wanted to do something special today so I was determined to come to CPK.  I asked to see what options I'd have there. They came up with a huge menu of options I hadn't considered and pointed out that it's fine also to have any pizza without cheese. I asked which one would be the best option for that, and they mentioned the spinach artichoke pizza.  The pizza itself was delicious! I hadn't had a pizza in my hand in years, and it felt like I got to be a part of the club again. The service was also incredible. When they first came out with the pizza, the waiter mentioned he thought half of the pizza was a little burnt. To me, I didn't see it, but I shrugged and he said he already was having them make a new pizza. I got to keep the first one. The pride they had in their product and service was really nice and seemingly rare to come across in restaurants these days.  So, as the other reviews say: the waitstaff is great, the food is tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Rob E.,"Kent, WA",0,3,3,5.0,1/27/2014,"I come here almost every day on my lunch break from work, so almost everyone knows me by name. I have tried a ton of different pizzas and sandwiches, but the turkey club with pea soup is my favorite. The pizza is good as well. The staff here are awesome. They are all super friendly, however I am also a gracious and generous tipper. I always have to laugh when people stiff on the tips and then are upset when the service is lacking the next time they go in. If you don't tip, they have no incentive or motivation to provide you with extraordinary service, you effing cheapskate. So, if you want good service. Leave a decent tip. Don't violate the cardinal rule of f#%king with people who handle your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Tatyana J.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,,4.0,4/24/2015,"This is the best pizza place I know of so far! I've been to CPK so many times it's not even funny. Pricing can get a little up there depending on how fancy you want to get. Very good pricing, the food has always been amazing, servers are always very nice, and the atmosphere is always a plus.  If you get a chance you have to try their butter cake! It's absolutely amazing. I usually order that first before I actually get my main meal :) 4 stars do to being a little pricey... but worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=60
Ko T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",52,152,496,3.0,1/7/2013,"Very few diners (mostly empty) on a Monday evening at 6pm. Food: Ordered raspberry iced-tea ($3) and thin crust meat cravers ($13). I was very disappointed with res berry iced-tea. It has that napkin smell/taste for some reason. Pizza looked great, but taste wise didn't really stand out from any other pizza places. A little spicy to be honest. I do think it is slightly over priced. I could be wrong. Service: My waiter provided good service. Made sure my drink was refilled. I know I didn't like the iced-tea, but I had to keep drinking it because the pizza was spicy for me. MISC: Parking lot is shared with other establishments so it gets filled quickly.

D H.,"Seattle, WA",0,35,15,4.0,3/24/2016,"Chain. What can I say? Consistent. They have a great Chopped salad. No I don't eat pizza. This salad is very good with lots of stuff innit and I added sliced back olives and avocados. Excellent suggestion from the server. Good attention to detail and friendly if you are by yourself or in a group. Downside is a $17 salad! Can you say massive profit margin?? I guess this dinner salad cross subsidizes the other dishes, but there must be giant overhead to absorb the heft prices charge. Anyway, I still liked it. It's become almost impossible to get a really good salad anymore. They are full of crappy bagged lettuce, kale and arugula, which I hate.
