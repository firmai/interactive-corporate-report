The server, John, did an excellent job with the service.  He, as well as the other members of the staff, came by the table to ask if we needed anything else throughout the entire visit.  The managers were making sure things were running smoothly and making sure customers were happy.  I was very pleased with the visit and I look forward to returning soon.  Plus, you can go shopping before or afterwards since it's located at the Wellington Green mall.   You go, Reeeeeeeeeeeeeddddd Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wellington,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

It was chaotic because it was the first week, but we expected that.  What we didn't expect was the lack of marketing. We didn't even know it was open.

We were seated immediately. The server did take a while to great us. The drinks also came later than usual. Our entrees came out in a timely manner Ordered the ""bottomless"" lemonade drinks. Pretty good. Entrees ordered was the simple burger with pepper Jack cheese. The simple burger tasted pretty simple. It was a basic and needed flavor. The tavern burger was good and tasteful according to my eating partner..my husband. My little kiddo ordered the chicken fingers and fruit...he's eating it so I'm figuring its good. The fruit salad has some type of red sugar coating on it. Thanks to that he's eating the apples.  Our server Crystal was very nice and informative.

65,Lela W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,5,,1.0,2014-06-07,"Went with a party of 8 on 6/7/14; arrived around 6:40 pm and our group was seated around 7:15. Our waitress was pleasant enough but it quickly became clear she was very inexperienced. After getting our drinks she disappeared for quite awhile. Then she disappeared again after taking our dinner orders. We were looking for her to check on the status  of our food after waiting for another 1/2 hour!  She e was m.i.a. so we asked another server to check on our order and she was extremely rude. Fed up after seeing other diners who were seated after us get their food, we asked for the manager. She apologized and went to find our server who then finally appeared and apologized as well,  but still no food. Finally,  nearly an hour after we were seated, 6 out of 8 of our orders came out. 2 of those with cold food. One in our group ordered a garden burger (vegetarian) which she sent back since it had clearly been sitting around and was ice cold. When they brought her a new one,  it had a slice of bacon in it In the ""vegetarian"" burger. Thank goodness she saw it before biting into it. Other burgers that were ordered as well done were rare. While we understand that it takes a newly opened restaurant awhile to get the ""kinks"" out,  this is an established chain and after being open for a month, these kinds of blunders don't bode well for the expected service in the future from this location.

66,Sam C.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,22,2.0,1.0,2014-06-13,"The Red Red Robin should go bob bob bobbing along until they get their act together!  The Yelp reviews and the line at the door at 6:30 made us believe the 7 of us were in for a great ""gourmet"" hamburger as the ads said. The picture of the nice thick juicy burger looked so mouthwatering delicious. NOT! The first sign was that the ""gourmet burgers"" had to be ordered medium well or well done. In other words, the burgers were frozen and had to be over-cooked to temperature. Second, it took an hour for our order to arrive, and only 4 out of the 7 orders at our table were as ordered.  Third, the nice juicy burger in the ad was a lie. The burger is about the size of a McDonalds, but you do get two of them, so you have two well done hockey pucks! Two of these went back to be cooked as they were black and crusty, as did another meal that was made incorrectly. One ""riblet"" dinner was so over-cooked it looked like charcoal. The entire evening was ruined and it was was a terrible experience. I will say the server was so very apologetic and nice, and the manager came by and took the three meals off our bill and remade my wifes burger, but all in all the 7 of us scratched this place off our list of dining establishments. With Duffy's, Limburgers, and many other places to get great burgers made from fresh meat that can be cooker rare to medium for $2-$3 less than Red Robin around this area that unless you're trapped in Wellington Mall during a hurricane, there's no reason to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wellington?start=60,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

18,Rusten M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",21,104,647.0,2.0,2014-11-05,"There are two Red Robins locally; Wellington Green & PB Outlets.  Both are nearly identical in quality. My opinion is that despite the claim of ""gourmet burgers"", these fall short. They're not terrible burgers, but you definitely will find much better around the area. However, if you don't judge a good burger by the quality of the patty, you may like Red Robin because they have a variety of special/unique burgers that may appeal to some. For me, I judge a burger by the quality of the patty.  For that, I'd prefer to head down the street a couple miles to Cityplace and hit BurgerFi, or up to PBG where I'd get Vic & Angelo's burger (despite being an upscale Italian place, they have a great burger).  I'd mention Shula Burger if they were closer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wellington,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704

The initial hostess was cordial but I didn't understand the 10 min wait when there were several tables available including two booths clearly visible (one they seated us at) from the lobby. After being seated our waiter, Pedro was pleasant and addressed our table promptly with menus and followed with drinks, our order, etc. At that point, it started a downward turn. For an item that a regular on their menu, the appetizer took awhile to come out. That's when I noticed it, no napkins but no crisis yet - pretzels aren't messy. Then the real wait began ... and the tea ran out ... and the kids are bored and hungry. We're getting aggravated. Our server came by and advised our food is on its way out - psych! It didn't come out for another 10 minutes. Yum, we're hungry, getting short on time, etc - let's eat! I took my first bite and that's when I remembered, crap no set-ups and my hands are greasy! Uugggg. I see our server darting around but I can't get his attention. I asked the other hostess (one with a bad attitude named Tyler?) for napkins and utensils. I watched her bypass the basket a few yards away and walk all the way back to the kitchen where our server was to tell him (SMH). Shortly before we left I saw her do the same thing with table behind us. It's not her job, I get it but you are all there to serve your customers. Why wouldn't you help your coworker and then work out the ""not my job"" crap later?! It's just not a nice practice all the way around.

Our server brought out the bottomless fries, while we all decided what burger we wanted. ( I can't really remember which ones we got, but they weren't bad tasting just plain.)  We then played the waiting game while others around is got their food first. The fries were no longer helping our hunger. Finally after 30-45 minutes of waiting for our food, we were a bit disappointed. They had a picture of this special burger, that my brother ordered, and it looked nothing like the picture. After that satisfying experience, we just payed the bill, and left. It wasn't expensive nor was it cheap.

The first time it was the opening week and the place was packed. I ordered a bruschetta chicken sandwich and it was horrid. The chicken was dry and the bun was super soggy. The fries were terrible, as I can see why they're bottomless. Horrible time. I went the second time as I was getting some last minute things at the mall for my trip to London. Me and my mom were the only two customers there. I got the Red Robin gourmet cheeseburger and it was alright. Not as bad as the last time. The fries were mediocre, just like the first time. The third time I came there I was with my dad and brother, having a Saturday at the mall. I got the mushroom Swiss burger and it was just as bad as the first time. Bun was soggy, burger was undercooked, fries were mediocre, and it was HORRID!

11,Ashley H.,"Tampa, FL",338,317,307.0,3.0,2015-01-25,"We went back last weekend to see if they had improved their service compared to the last visit in November. I did reach out to the HQ about the prior experience and this second visit proved that they listened. The employees were much more cheerful and did not wear black lipstick. Lol We were seated on the other side of the room by the bar this time. And we were immediately greeted by a server who got our drinks right away. Nice! The good vibes we got from our server made us want to splurge a little by getting an appetizer. We went for the spinach artichoke dip. It was brought out immediately, too. It was piping hot and so good!  We ordered the clucks and shrimp basket while I got the California Chicken Club as it way usual favorite at the RR in NY. The food was brought out after a good amount of time as we just finished the appetizer.  I was disappointed in the structure of my sandwich as there was very little guacamole on it as if it was then scraped off. The server saw that and said that's not right and brought out a cup of guacamole. I began to eat the sandwich but then another problem came up, the bottom bun was completely soaked. It made eating the sandwich much more difficult and I didn't bother asking the server again. So, the sandwich wasn't as  crispy and flavorful as I remembered. The clucks and shrimp basket was good even though the shrimp was so heavily breaded.  My husband was craving for something sweet and we decided to also splurge on getting a cheesecake with strawberry sauce on it. It made up for my sandwich.  Would we come back? Very likely not. It does seem that the quality and pride taken in creating the food has gone down hill over the years despite this restaurant location being fairly new. I guess that's what happens when regional restaurants turn into a large franchise opening up in the farthest part of the US that it's not the same as the original.  I give the service 4.5 stars but the food and chef really deserves the 3 stars. Better luck next time....

Didn't wait long to be seated. Once we ordered our food, the wait began. Took close to 40 mins for our food to arrive. My daughter ordered the french dip, it came out cold and the cheese was not melted whatsoever. incredibly salty. I had ordered a burger. The lettuce was rotten, and well, that did it for me. Lost my appetite completely after biting into it. My daughters bf also had rotten lettuce on his burger.My stepson ordered a cheeseburger without tomato. It had tomato on it, which the cheese was melted into. had to peel off the cheese in order to eat it without the tomato. No biggie but was it messy! It was the burger with fried egg on top. As for the fries, well they were so salty we could even eat them. We asked to speak with the manager about all of this, he came over and RUDELY asked ""whats the problem"" Then says, What do you want me to do? Really???? You should know what to do... Wanted to make us new plates, well by this time its after 9 pm.  He comped my sons meal, after I told him it was mine that wasn't eaten, he took mine off as well. But charged me $3 for the seltzer water I didn't even drink. Ok, that's fine. We also watched several table around us sending back food as well and asking about the long wait.

Everyone elsewhere had burgers. Two were ok but I'd say Burger King quality at $12 prices. One was disgusting.

Our party (3 adults, 2 kids) arrived first thing, in fact we were the very first customers the day we went. We were seated fairly quickly, but after that everything went down hill. It took a while for a server to come over to our table, by the time he did we were ready to order and placed both drink and food orders at the same time. As we sat, waiting on our food, other customers had arrived and some actually received their meals before we did! About 20min. after ordering the kids meals finally came out (great!) we assumed that since it had been so long our food would be out shortly thereafter...NOPE! 25 min later (thats 45min. after placing our initial order) the adults food came out...mind you it was only burgers...nothing that should take 45mins! To top it all off, I had ordered my burger plain and it came out with everything on it! I sent the burger back and the server brought it back out about 2min later, took a few bites and got an odd taste, opened the burger to find cheese covering up some onions...what they had basically done was scrape off what they could, and then covered it with more cheese. When we were waiting on the adult food I did speak with the kitchen manager and he honestly (to me) acted like he could care less about our concerns, when our food finally came out and our order was wrong, i went back and talked asked to talk to the manager again, only to have the kitchen manager come back out...I finally said I wanted to talk to the general manager (who was doing inventory that day) and he came out and apologized and made me a new burger (to-go) himself and paid for our entire meal...this is the only reason i gave a star, because at least he did something about the situation. I haven't been able to eat there since, it makes me sick to my stomach thinking of it...but my son loves the place (bottomless mac and cheese) so we may try again soon...and I will update with the results of that visit...if its better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wellington?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.956,2.24

Hadn't been here in a while partially because of past experience and the desire to eat healthier but it's my bday month and who can pass up a free burger!? Thank goodness it was free because I already regret going here. Came for lunch and our server tried to give good service but then was sat about 6 tables at once. Food didn't take very long but it didn't come out right and our server, who looked like the only one working, was busy running around. Burger was ok, fries were cold and by the time free ones came we were done. Then the check came, at the top it said my burger was free but then the total due still included the $8.99. Apparently that's a thing because the Manager and server both made some comments that raised eyebrows at my table.

It seems macaroni and cheese is the lowest risk meal on the menu, but only because it's hard to screw up.

It was at 12:00 so we thought it was going to be busy.    It wasn't.   First sign. Although we were seated immediately,  it took our waitress almost 10 minutes before coming to take our drink order. 2nd sign. Although we were seated right by the bar (no one else there) it took her 7 minutes to get a water and Coca-Cola.  3rd sign. We were told all about the 'reward program' but really not anything else by our unprofessional looking waitress. She took our order...we've now been there 30 minutes and our order hadn't gone in yet. A burger for $10.99 (crazy!) and a prime rib sandwich for $13.99 (better be excellent) and since I wanted the sweet potato fries instead of regular fries they would be adding on an extra $1.49!! Fourth sign. Food comes 25 minutes later...we are bith going to be late going back to work,  but we were celebrating my Bday. His hamburger was okay, but definitely can not compare to Duffy's, Five Guys or Brass Ring (all close by). He wasn't impressed by his fries so didn't order any more...even though they are 'bottomless'...which actually means the bottom of the small cylinder they serve them in has NO BOTTOM!   My 'prime rib' certainly WASN'T!   It actually tasted   (and looked) like they took sliced deli roast beef, stuck it in the microwave and put it on a small roll...it was tasteless and if I hadn't been SO hungry, I would've sent it back. The first serving of sweet potato fries (that I paid extra for-also bottomless) was hot, fresh and tasted good. When I finally got our waitress's attention and got a 'refill' the server brought this large plate with a small pile of overcooked,  greasy, shriveled up s.p. fries!  What??!  Fifth sign. Meanwhile there are now 3 other tables in her station and we have been forgotten....mgr comes up and asked how everything was....SERIOUSLY??? We told him we needed our waitress so we could leave.  It was now 1:30 !! He goes and she comes....hands my husband the bill....she didn't know that I had asked him to lunch.  I took the bill and because both of us have been in the restaurant business,  she did NOT receive 20% tip....which is what we normally give. Furthermore,  she never asked how the meal was (she probably knew) or because she knew it was my Bday, any kind of dessert.    The 'reward program' that she had spent so much of OUR time on, was never mentioned again....maybe because by now she knew this was the sixth sign that WE WON'T BE BACK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wellington,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002

My boyfriend and I were seated in the bar area. The restaurant was pretty empty. The bartender/server was friendly and greeted us promptly. She brought us our drinks and took a while for her to return to take our order. Considering it wasn't busy,  I thought that was odd. When we ordered our food,  she asked if we wanted pink or no pink for the Burger temperature.  I said I'd like it as pink as they could make it. She warned they won't make it less cooked then medium.  OK fine,  that's their policy.  Not her fault.  The food took a ridiculously long time to come out. We both ran out of drinks at this point. Both of our burgers were well done. The bartender came back to our table when our mouths were full to ask how the food was. We couldn't really give a reply. She just walked away and brought us a refill on our drinks. I only ate 1/3 of my Burger BC it was so over cooked. The bartender was no where to be found the majority of our meal so I couldn't report it to her. Later,  I asked for more fries because I was hungry since I didn't want to eat my burger and felt the window to send it back was gone.  Again,  took a very long time to get the fries. At least they were hot and fresh. Once we were done eating, I asked a question about the milk shakes and if I could have Bailey's instead of Grand Marnier in one of them. She said there would be an up charge. I was surprised BC Bailey's is a cheaper liquor. She didn't even offer to ask management if she could accommodate my request. She had an attitude and insisted there would be a charge. If her attitude were different, I would have sucked it up and just paid the up charge and enjoyed the milkshake. I chose to skip it since I didn't want to spend anymore time or money here. And to be clear,  I wasn't upset about the up charge for the alcohol, I was upset by her attitude and lack of interest to try and resolve it for me, the slow service, and her lack of presence throughout our meal. My boyfriend finished his beer and we never saw her again,  except leaving the restaurant where she and 3 other employees were hanging out at the hostess stand. Guess that's where she disappeared to the majority of our meal. I won't be back to this location.  There are much better alternatives that will cook the food properly and give good service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wellington,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
