Waynetta M.,"Fairfield, CA",82,66,59,3.0,5/15/2012,"The address is correct but the telephone # is wrong.  However, I had such a wonderful Mother's Day dinner at Friday's. Happy Hour all day wasn't too shabby either. The carnation was a perfect touch. We love Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Vicente G.,"San Francisco, CA",74,310,417,1.0,7/5/2011,"$16 for one of their sour margaritas is outrageous! No wonder they don't print the prices on the menu. I feel sorry for their servers who have to hawk these sad drinks. The photos looks great on the menu but beware, the glasses are shaped so that there's actually very little liquid in it, mostly ice! The service is ok, but the prices are absolutely ludicrous, even for an airport. Save yourself some money and go to your local freezer aisle and buy all their stuff on sale!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
William P.,"Montclair, CA",259,235,,1.0,10/23/2010,"So I get to the airport, and it's early, and I've missed breakfast.  TGIFridays in the terminal offers breakfast, and a quick look at the menu shows something I'm willing to eat. They seat me, fine.  They leave me with the menu, also fine. The girl comes for my order: bottled water, I say.  She responds, ""we don't have bottled water""  But it's on the menu, I respond.  She shrugs.  How about apple juice?  She says ""we don't have apple juice.""  What do you have?  She lists the juices, and I choose pineapple. So I order Belgian waffle with a side of bacon.  ""We don't have bacon, is sausage all right?""  No, it's not.  ""The Belgian waffle only has diet syrup, is that ok?""  No, it's not.  Give me a bagel, then. Then they serve the bagel with melon, which I""m allergic to.  Nowhere on the menu did they mention melon, since the bagel itself is considered a side. Sucks. I won't be back, and I'll reconsider ever going to any TGIFridays, for that matter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Albert H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",117,1223,281,2.0,11/27/2012,"Servers were unfamiliar with the menu, and it was a very restricted/small menu compared to other locations.  Very slow service too.  Unfortunately it's one of a handful of options available in this airport, so I can see how they manage to stay in business anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Carrie D.,"Littleton, CO",156,336,10,3.0,8/16/2011,"I gotta say, I'm not a fan of the Ontario Airport and I fly into the LA area alot! And I'm at a total loss as to why a restaurant like TGI Fridays is only open from 5am-5pm.  I've tried to eat at TGI Fridays twice. The first time was at about 5pm and there were people inside eating. I mean, it's dinnertime, right?! As soon as I stepped inside, the server then shouted at me 'We're closed!' This time I actually got to have a bite to eat. It was about 4pm and I made it before closing! After the day I'd had, I wanted a drink or two, so I found a seat, walked across a floor so sticky, it was an effort to move my feet after sitting in one place for a while. The server was ok. She wasn't terribly pleasant, but she did a pretty good job. Brought my drinks and food pretty quickly. But it was pretty obvious she wanted me to take my food and go. She asked me more than once 'You said To Go, right?' Finally I said 'No, ma'am, I want to sit right here and eat my food.' The food came and was fresh and pretty good. My drinks were good as well. But to pay $10 for a Captain and Diet seems a little crazy, even in an airport bar! In the end, I had two drinks and my meal was chicken fingers and I paid $30 for that! I doubt I'll be back here. I know there's a Mexican place that stays open later than 5. And my flights are always in the evening. It just totally blows my mind that so many vendors in this airport close so early!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
William G.,"Yorba Linda, CA",46,257,158,3.0,2/20/2013,This was an airport TGI Friday's. The waitress was amazing. She was so funny. Really made  waiting for our flight pass by.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Jeannie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,27,9,4.0,7/2/2010,"I know the review for this tgif is not the best, but i would have to say the service we had tonite was pretty awesome. Our server Courtney was very sweet and bubbly. She checked back with us at least 5 times.  The food was decent, my jack daniels steak was really medium rare as ordered. Bf ordered the new carribean ribs, it tasted similar to the old jack daniels one again- but still, he gives a 4/5.  TGIF's food has been pretty steady in comparing to the Yardhouse which my bf loves- although Yardhouse has the best quality beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Anne P.,"Oroville, CA",56,439,64,2.0,3/14/2010,"The service was super slow/poor in the restaurant.  I asked for an Arnold Palmer (Ice Tea\Lemonade) and got an Ice Tea.  It took 10 or so minutes to get the AP.  I ordered the crusty pecan? chicken salad.  The salad greens were fresh enough but drowned in the sharp vinegarrette dressing.  The chicken breast was ok.  I should of told them to not put on the stale dried cranberries.  I must of picked off a cup of them.   When said and done, I literally had to get up, and hand the waitress my card to pay for the meal. I think next time, I will try the schotzs deli or mexican place there. Happy travel!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Scott C.,"Gibson City, IL",3,41,8,3.0,2/23/2011,Pretty average. Gary was our waiter and did a good job. Service was fast.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Tim M.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,313,1010,3.0,10/10/2011,"It's in the airport if your running late and it is in the afternoon or evening when you are flying out of town, it makes it nice and easy to get a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Gregory J.,"Carmichael, CA",2,1,,1.0,11/21/2010,"Oh where to start,  I walk in to this establishment and I am the only costumer in the entire restaurant. Why it took Gary the bartender eight minutes to ask me what to drink is beyond me. However once he did ask me and I replied with a margarita, he informed me that he did not know how to make one. I said I was a bartender and I'll be glad to tell him how, was rebutted with we are out of tequila, what else do you want? So I ordered a gin and tonic (a well drink that cost $12.50).  After another laborious wait, Gary came back to take my order (which he forgot to put in the computer until after I reminded him that it should not take 17 minutes to but bacon lettuce and tomato on a piece of bread).  Once the burnt sandwich came out of the kitchen, Gary then let me know that the entire restaurant was out of mustard.   It was at this point that I started to watch Gary interact with other costumers.  He carded every single person that came into the restaurant (even a man well over 60) however he neglected to ID three women sitting at the bar all with very noticeable cleavage. Instead of getting me a glass of water or asking if he could pour me another $12 drink, he talked with a co worker and used profanity to talk about past costumers, their boss, corporate, and other co workers.   If I acted this was in my bar I would be fired on the spot.  This is the worst airport restaurant experience I was ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Bill H.,"Annapolis, MD",51,24,21,1.0,9/13/2011,Bad. Just really really bad. In Ontario (CA) airport. Someone should be sued but I had a flight to catch. String beans from hell (how do you mess up string beans?),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Robert R.,"Sun City, CA",37,231,2,3.0,11/23/2011,"For airport dining (at Ontario), there is not a large selection of places to eat and this is as good as it gets. This is not to say the food is not good, they have limited menu items compared to non-airport locations, and the hours are not convenient for early or late travelers (whole airport is like that). You certainly pay the airport price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Merrill M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",458,472,38,3.0,5/25/2010,So one of our close friends decides to treat my wife and I to TGIF. Not a place we eat very often but it was close to his office where we were visiting. Last time I came to this place was 5 years ago. So service was pretty good and our server was on top of everything. We order the artichoke dip which was pretty good. Not too salty or dry and the chips were fresh tasting. I ordered the crab cakes. On the menu it says steamed veggies and seasoned rice. When it came out it was just broccoli and Spanish rice. The broccoli was horrible and the rice was super super salty..aacckk. The crab cakes tho were really yummy. No imitation crab meat or filled with potatoes or bread crumbs it was pure fresh crab meat. They give you 3 large cakes. My wife had the club sandwich with sweet potato fries. For some reason there was more regular fries than sweet potato fries..Hmmmm trying mix it up a bit??? We also had the french onion soup with was a-ok nothing fancy. I myself thought it was salty and didn't like the fact there was a large onion ring in the middle. Odd to me... Other than that it was a very very average place. I feel that TGIF is going downhill and becoming less popular for that hang out watch the game type of crowds. Oh well...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Julie B.,"Rocklin, CA",0,34,,1.0,5/20/2013,"Bad representation for TGIF Fridays!  Wanted to have lunch while waiting for our flight but walked out after we opened up the sticky menus, couldn't get the 1 waitress on duties attention and saw how dirty the place - the other patrons said it was a long wait and not good.  Very sad considering there aren't many choices in that airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Andrew G.,"Santa Cruz, CA",26,49,8,1.0,2/21/2011,"Closes at 5:00pm, including on Fridays.  So if you have late flight out of Ontario or one that leaves early evening, don't count on this place for any food or drink.  Useless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
Depeche G.,"Ontario, CA",3,25,,1.0,11/22/2010,Went for a late night dinner. The firecracker shrimp appetizer tasted like they used old oil to fry them in. The sweet n sour sauce was bland. Our food was cold and the service was extremely slow! Won't be going back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
J l.,"Kihei, HI",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2011,Went there on a Sunday afternoon. The floor was very sticky and many of the tables has not been cleaned. Food was disappointing   Can't recommend,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ontario-2
