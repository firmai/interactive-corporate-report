David C.,"Fayetteville, AR",3,44,25,4.0,10/16/2017,"Really these people have it together! The food and management had it together . If you want a steak, do it! Salad fantastic! Margaritas do it! You won't be dissatisfactied",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Sonja T.,"McAlester, OK",2,4,5,4.0,9/7/2017,"We were a party of 4, our server was great! I had the triple berry margarita which I really liked & my husband had the Long Island ice tea & he liked it. Our food came out in a timely manner and was good. I've had the shrimp fajitas before & really like it. The reason for me not giving 5 stars is that this time the shrimp was a little over cooked on both mine & my husbands.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Seth B.,"McKinney, TX",127,31,18,1.0,4/10/2017,"ZERO STARS!!! I literally just now walked out, it was such poor service. Walked in and sat at bar. The two bartenders were obviously trading out; one was closing out her till and the other was, well doing nothing. The one just standing there came over and said hi, but didn't ask what I would like or if I needed a menu, which I did. I asked for a water with lemon and for some reason she had to go to the back to get that. She sat it down and walked over to the other girl closing out and just started chatting again. I didn't even drink my water, because I had no straw. I'm traveling for business and was starving and had no time to waste, unlike the two bartenders. I waited patiently a few more minutes and then realized I wasn't a concern. Sad thing is, I always tip 50% (especially when I'm on expenses) because I waited tables 10 years before getting into my career and know that WAITERS DEPEND ON TIPS (in case you didn't know, so tip then well)!!!  My advice, go to Braums; there was no wait, I was properly greeted and the food came out fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Drew K.,"New Cumberland, PA",10,12,,2.0,6/10/2017,This is the second time I've eaten here and I should not come back based off of my first visit. Waitress was nice enough even though I had to wait awhile for both if my drinks. Bartender was loud and obnoxious...she got my drink order wrong and never apologized or offered to remove it from my bill. Food was tasty but did not come out hot at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Steve A.,"Lee's Summit, MO",0,6,,2.0,8/10/2017,"The other reviews tell you what you need to know. Sat at the bar. Poor lady was over worked but still tried to carry on conversations with her friends at the bar. Bar top was not clean, tacky. Bad, normal Chili's food. Order anything and it's out in 3 minutes. They may need to get an even bigger microwave. The center of mine was not hot, but I ate it. Not a great experience, will look for another place on my next pass through town. I will say, all the folks, staff and locals are very friendly and welcoming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Shelba R.,"McAlester, OK",0,3,,4.0,5/15/2017,I take my mom out to lunch and her favorite place is Chilis. We have eaten here several times and the service and food has been excellent. I was surprised to see the negatives. The chocolate lava cake is worth the trip it's yummy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Tanya M.,"Cahokia, IL",210,448,66,1.0,5/31/2016,"I usually love Chili's. The server was friendly. I just did not like the food. I ordered the smoked wings. They were cold. I ordered fries and the were just ok. I had issues with the card machine and had to flag the server down to bring me a receipt. (I have gotten taken before).  I know I spent $30, but the food was not that memberable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Jean G.,"Pearland, TX",2,59,19,2.0,10/10/2016,Only gave this place 2 stars Cuz of bar. If u wanna drink and watch sports come check it out. Don't come to this place to eat. Should have read reviews. Order chicken and salmon combination. Both came out cold. Did not enjoy food. Left all of chicken ate half of salmon but did finished. Only thing I really enjoyed was the salad. U can't fck up a salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
David M.,"Bellville, TX",32,4,,5.0,1/17/2017,"I must say, I was very skeptical having dinner here, seeing the less than stellar reviews. Wow, was I surprised. The steak was cooked perfectly, as was the asparagus.  Service was excellent as was the atmosphere.  A big 2 thumbs way up for this chilis. Job well done!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Kyle D.,"Norman, OK",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2016,"This is literally the worst chilis I have ever been to. When I pulled up, 3 of the servers were standing in the parking lot smoking ciggies and clucking like hens. As I went inside to pick up my To-Go order, I couldn't help but notice the entire restaurant looked like a pig pen. Tables, floors, the bar, and even the kitchen were littered with dirty dishes, garbage, and old food. I felt filthy just walking into the place. I proceeded to stand by the bar/to go counter for a good 10 minutes before an employee moseyed over to me and asked if I needed help. I couldn't help but notice her dirty fingernails when I handed her my money.  Shortly after that, the 3 smokey servers that were outside when I pulled up, stroll in the side door wreaking of ashtray and being obnoxiously loud.  A few very long minutes later, I finally get my ""food"", by this time I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Fast forward 5 minutes. I get back to my hotel room and start to inspect my food. Why am I not surprised? My rice is hard and cold. My cup of beans is only half full and cold. My cup of chicken tortilla soup was, I kid you not, HALF full of cheese! And the other half was (surprise, surprise) cold soup that tasted like cleaning products. The enchiladas were disgusting as well. I ended up throwing it all away. Biggest waste of 10 bucks in my entire life.  I HIGHLY recommend that you do NOT go to this Chilis. It is a roach motel.  You're better off going to Walmart and buying everything you need to make bologna sandwiches.   Overall experience, 0 stars. This place should be shut down. Absolutely disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester

Kenneth L.,"Norman, OK",0,4,,4.0,9/30/2016,Dinner tonight at Chili's was good. Service was friendly and prompt.  Read some of the reviews in particular the one about hating chain restaurants.  Make me wonder why you would ever pull into one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Jo Lynn C.,"Gunter, TX",3,41,14,2.0,8/20/2016,"Ugh. I remember why I hate chain restaurants. We stopped here on our way back home. It's average service, seriously slow getting our order, and crap quality food. Not worth the money or time. Only go here if your mad at yourself or you hate the people your taking to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Alex E.,"Allen, TX",14,162,1,4.0,11/5/2015,"Not a bad stop for lunch our honeymoon road trip. We sat in the bar since the place was packed with a wait. I got some chicken crispers while my wife got some tilapia. Both were cooked fine. Chips & salsa were great as always, for some reason Chili's has awesome salsa... Bartender was friendly, place was covered with TVs with every game on. No problems & no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Justin N.,"Clarksville, AR",0,21,3,5.0,2/9/2017,Was skeptical about eating here due to all the negative reviews. Maybe service is better in the evening vs. at lunch. Experience was very good for being a chain. Food came out hot and very presentable. Good flavor on everything. On par with any other chilie's I've eaten at. Server was very attentive and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Clyde D.,"McAlester, OK",0,1,,5.0,2/4/2017,I have eaten there several times and have found it to be excellent every time.  The food has been great.  The Margaritas excellent and the service very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Huppy G.,,0,3,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"I was here on 7/10/16.  We order our food and gave the menu back to the waiter.  He came back and ask if we need it an appetizer so we ask how much is the table guacamole he say 5 dollars so we order while we wait.  When we get ready to pay the guacamole actually cost more than the entre and we ask what happened to the 5 dollar  table guacamole he say let me see how much it shows in the menu.  He say he was wrong and he was going to bring the manager.  When she came she say that is the price.  We ask for the one in the advertisement on the table that doesn't have price.  She say ""I guess i can give you the price"" with and attitude.  Never came back to say if she fix it or the waiter.  How a manager can be that rude? I was in shock!! NOT COMMING BACK AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Riri R.,"Homewood, IL",2,8,10,1.0,5/20/2015,"Just Horrible! Stopped at this location on our road-trip, waited over 1/2 hr just for our drinks. They dint have enough waitress for the amount of tables.

Jasmine B.,"Gorman, TX",1,31,14,1.0,9/27/2016,"Ok. So freezer flash frozen. The three F's. Ordered the trio skillet sensation. Asked for my steak rare of course I know on a frying skillet I'm not getting a rare steak. But at best hoping for medium.. epic fail... not only did my food arrive like 2hr late. With the most horrific appetizers known to man. Leaving Me to wonder did I really pay money for that??? Just when you think that we'll surely they can't fuck up a mixed drink only for my sister in law to order a hard lemonade it tasted like akla.seltzer. I don't know anyone who wants to drink that shit when their sick more or less pay money to ""enjoy""it. Negative Ghost rider. My steak overly done I switched wit my fiance who's steak was very much still alive and kicking . I offered him to switch with me and told him I would gladly finish killing it. So of course he did .. my ck. Was bland and tasted like a rubber band. It was obviously frozen as well as the shrimp  and my fiance ck. So after assisting the table in mourning the worst dinner of our life we decide that the government should pack that restaurant up and use it for a modern day form of tortue.  Avoid it like the plague. And I don't know which is worst that the people who work there continue to pretend that everything is OK when it's not....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Mike T.,"Dallas, TX",0,16,,4.0,10/25/2016,"Unlike another poster my food always comes out great. We stop by a few times a month but we are treated like regulars. We always sit in the bar area so I can keep up on sports and my better half can chat with Rose, our favorite bartender. The food is as good as chain restaurants get but the staff keeps us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester
Jacqueline G.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,1.0,12/9/2015,"This is a truly awful restaurant! I ordered the taco trio dinner last time I was in town and got food poisoning. My flight home the next day was a miserable experience. I will never eat here again despite the convenient location (near hotels). I recommend you stay away, too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Randy R.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,7,2,1.0,11/9/2015,"I guess you have to be a local to get good service. Rose the bartender would serve drinks to those she knew on a first name basis, but it took forever for me to be able to place an order for food and then pay. I was so frustrated and ready to leave that I didn't realize she gave me the wrong check until I was back at my hotel. The food was subpar and pretty much just thrown on a plate. This place is a mess",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Mark G.,"Fenton, MO",1,33,,2.0,5/26/2016,"Ordered food to go while traveling through town.  The guy asked the person before me if they wanted utensils. They said yes. He went and got food and gave to her. She said, did you put the utensils in, he said no, sorry forgot.  Same exact thing happened with me.  That should have been a warming to me to look at my food.  I didn't and got back to my room only to find out they forgot my order of onion rings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
John A.,"Boise, ID",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2015,"Worst bartender I've ever encountered. Very unprofessional, she was eating at a table in the bar with a manager and wait staff. Drinks were hard to refill, initial request for appetizer was ignored. There was some kind of training computer based training going in at the bar with other employees. I have no idea how long my drink order woulda taken if some sort of manager hadn't nodded my way to the bartender.  Second night if terrible service, find some other restaurant to patronize.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Kathy T.,"Russellville, AR",1,20,21,5.0,6/7/2015,Consistently good.  We frequent  McAlester often and this remains my favorite place to eat at...I don't mind spending a little extra for specialties such as appetizers or dip.  Service was excellent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Mike N.,"McAlester, OK",0,6,,4.0,9/23/2015,I gotta give it up to Chilis here. I was in town for two weeks and this is the only place I could get veggies that weren't on a burger or fried. I love going to local joints but I needed some steamed broccoli. Service was prompt and accurate and the fare was like any other Chilis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Debbie C.,"Norman, OK",0,54,8,1.0,1/22/2015,"Went there around 4:30 with a party of 7 to celebrate a couples marriage. Ordered wine and Moscato. Was told they were out of wine glasses,,,what?? This is a bar restaurant with these items on their menu!! Had 2! wine glasses tried to serve the rest of us in margarita glasses!! Not acceptable and they only had enough Moscato for one glass and tried to pass off Pinot Grigio for it!! Our waiter had an attitude and some girl, not a manager came over and told us she was going to Wal Mart to get glasses!!! At this point we said forget it!! The food was fine but this place needs to work on its customer service!! The worst Chilis I've ever been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Brandy M.,"Buda, TX",0,7,1,2.0,7/29/2015,"The bartender was super friendly and nice, but only to the men at the bar. The steak I ordered medium came well done and was like ground beef. I would say just an overall bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20

Adrienne W.,"Grapevine, TX",0,20,11,2.0,5/17/2015,"I eat at different Chili's and this one was subpar. The rice with my entire was undercooked and the bun on my husband's hamburger was a little hard.  I don't like dirty restaurants and this one wasn't very clean. A pet peeve of mine is to beat seated at a table that is still wet from being wiped down and having your napkin placed on the wet table and this happened here. There was also a little debris left in the seats. The worst thing was the salt shaker that first felt like it had not been cleaned for a while and then this was confirmed by the fact that the lid was clogged with debris. We took one from the empty table next to us and it wasn't much better.  On the positive side, the hostess and waitress were both very nice.  Overall, this Chili's needs some help in management. I would not be tempted to try this one again the next time I am passing through the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Anonymous A.,"Bixby, OK",0,1,,1.0,7/4/2015,"I have not been to a Chili's in quite some time until tonight. Stopped at this one on a whim as I was driving through heading north, and I was really, really disappointed.  Ordered the ribeye and it had the texture of rubber. It was rather strange and gross and I could not continue eating it. I've had many many ribeye steaks in my life so I know what it's supposed to feel like as I'm chewing and there was no way this could have actually been real meat.  The service was great, and everything else we had was delicious. I just can't get over that bizarre non-meat steak.  Probably won't be returning to another Chili's anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Garry H.,"Abilene, TX",202,800,1310,3.0,7/13/2013,3 stars because our waitress needed help. She was great but service was slow because not enough waitresses. Food was good and place was nice. Hire some more help!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20

Orville L.,"Tulsa, OK",191,66,220,1.0,9/2/2013,"Terrible food. Below the standards of what you might expect from a ""normal"" Chili's. Understaffed. Clean interior. The waitstaff is polite on the few occasions that you see them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Eric Y.,"Nevada, MO",73,64,,2.0,12/7/2013,"This place was a disaster.  How can the floor get so dirty?  I'll tell you how:  We witnessed two different waitresses in our section clearing tables and when they wiped down the tables, they just wiped everything up and off the side of the table onto the floor.  That isn't how I learned to wipe off a table, but apparently it is standard operating procedure at this place.  If you are going to do it that way, you'd better carry a broom to sweep up all the crap (French fries, straw wrappers, crumbs) that you are throwing on the floor.  Cleanliness is a real issue at this Chili's. The food was just OK.  Nothing to write home about, but edible.  The waitress that we had was weird.  She took our order, someone else brought out the appetizer, and then about 2 minutes later our food followed.  She commented that she was glad to see that the appetizer had arrived because she didn't know for sure if we had received it.  She immediately brought the check and dropped it off, failing to even ask if everything was cooked alright or if it tasted ok.  She didn't really seem to care that we were even there the rest of the time.  I didn't get anything else to drink and ran out.  Had to share a drink with my fiancé. We won't stop at this location again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20
Mike B.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,6,,1.0,4/9/2014,Wow is all I have to say this place is a mess they wait on the help that just got off but not the customers.

Dennis P.,"Gilroy, CA",0,26,,1.0,7/24/2013,"Arrived and were seated immediately. Waited about 15 minutes before finally going up to hostess and asking to be waited on. Food was mediocre and service was terrible, mostly due to not enough wait staff. We would have walked out after the first 10 minutes, but we had a disabled person in our party of four and it was a hassle getting inside in the first place and we were hungry. Would never go back.

Tony R.,"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",81,28,5,1.0,4/3/2011,"What a craphole! The only major sit down chain for almost 80 miles and they know it. The bar service is mediocre, and the food presentation is horrible. I never expect high end food at these type of places but they usually make up for it in atmosphere. So I get in and look around, maybe 5/6 tables are full so I belly up to the bar. It's filthy. I sit there and watch what looks like a manager or some defunct FBI guy with an ear piece go behind the bar and avoid eye contact, then goes away to make room for this slob of a man with a lei, ask me my drink order. This after, 8 or so minutes of nothing. The laugh comes in when the sloth asks me for my drink order then leaves the bar to go chat it up with the kitchen staff for another 5 minutes.
