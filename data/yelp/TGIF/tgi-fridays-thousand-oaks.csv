Greg W.,"Agoura Hills, CA",103,661,80,3.0,1/26/2012,So this is a typical TGI Friday's bar and restaurant.  Like most TGI's they make a lot of their money from booze that that shows as to their menu selections and the seating arrangements (and the floor can be stick a lot).  However TGI really has an AWESOME rewards club so like every other meal is free (net once you max out the coupon cheese).  I do take my family here so its kid friendly and always has decent food.   They carry a nice range of selection.  The Jack Daniels sauced items are really good.  I would recommend getting one if you have never had one (and their is no booze so no worries).  They also have some good deals in the right sized portions menu.  You will not stuff yourself or overspend but you will not leave hungry or dissatisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Sarah K.,"Burbank, CA",120,964,139,3.0,1/1/2012,"This place is definitely A-OK. I went on NYE and good lord are the waitresses HOT HOT HOT. I gawked at them for awhile until my boyfriend said I was getting creepy.  Now that many of the chain restaurants put the caloric content on the menus, there are very few things I can eat there without horrible guilt. The dragonfire chicken is REALLY GOOD! Totally recommend that meal, and they do a very good job on the broccoli there.  If you have the TGIF card, you can get crazy points/deals on the food. We always go in with a coupon and yesterday turned in points for a free steak dinner. $18 savings!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Sherryl I.,"Camarillo, CA",807,276,837,5.0,10/11/2009,"Yup, I know.  I can't believe I'm giving TGIF a total of 5 stars either!  But, fairness dictates that I must give credit where credit is due. This afternoon, I may just have had one of my most pleasant dining experiences ever.  Here's why: 1.  We were seated immediately by a hostess who welcomed us with a big smile and a warm greeting. 2.  Our drink order was taken and fulfilled within one minute. 3.  The server was attentive throughout the whole meal without being intrusive, even to make sure that our drinks never even became half-full. 4.  The appetizer, green bean fries, were at our table withing 4 minutes, piping-hot and crispy. 5.  We had ordered 1 hamburger to share.  It arrived already split in half and on separate plates (I didn't even ask for this).  Ya know, it's the little things like this that make a difference. 6.  The Jack Daniel's hamburger was DELICIOUS!  I asked for it to be prepared medium-well.  It arrived accordingly, moist and juicy. 7.  Our payment was processed within a matter of moments. All meals should be as flawless as the one I had today.  Ultimately, much of the service depends on which server you get.  So, many thanks to Jeffrey!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Amy S.,"Moorpark, CA",20,83,4,3.0,1/16/2012,"It was fine, the bartender was very nice.  I just thought the prices were way to high for the appetizers.  We got some drinks and just wanted a small bite.  We ordered the fried green beans and the cheeseburger sliders (the Green beans had 100 less calories than the sliders yowsers!) but my issue was the portion for the cost.  The green bean fries came on a plate.  Usually you might pay a little more if it is a healthier option (whatever) but it was not. It was just overpriced.   They probably did us a favor by not giving us more of those tasty, yet not worth it since they are so bad for me, ""beans""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Kevin S.,"Valencia, CA",0,50,,1.0,2/20/2012,"I don't expect much from a chain sportsbar staffed by people in stripey shirts. Fortunately for me, I got even less. We stopped in for a quick drink and waited ten minutes to get any service in the bar. There were maybe four tables in the bar, one of which had a waitress posted at it for the entire time. I understand being friendly is important to earning tips, but when customers have to ask you to do your job when you're working for tips and you deliver it at a snail's pace with attitude: you're done. I even had to walk the check to the register to pay it after waiting five minutes. I've had better service during a mugging... and I got out of it without having to leave a tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Richie W.,"Richmond, VA",294,419,81,1.0,2/6/2009,"Food is decent and well priced. However I have an issue with the cleanliness and service. I was there last Saturday night. The service was slow and it was not even that busy. I had finished my soda and the server did not notice and refill for about half an hour. We asked for a box - another 15 minute wait. The main problem was the bathrooms. The mensroom was absolutely disgusting. It was dirty and power towels, tissues all over the place. Sink blocked. It reminded me like a set from Trainspotting. This is not what I expect from a major chain restaurant. I was going to call the manager in, but was with family from out of town and did not want to create a scene.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Mike V.,"Oxnard, CA",37,58,,2.0,5/14/2010,"There is nothing good about who they are, or what they do.  You figure if you go to a place like this, and are stupid enough to buy a steak it will be cheap.  Nope, not cheap at all, and not anywhere near being good.  My wife had some kind of special Mac and Cheese, per my subliminal prodding.  Boy was I sorry she got it, It wasn't as bad as the old shoe they feed me, but it was not too good either, and too much money.  How can places like these charge more the 15 bucks per person, and get away with it?  Putting a pungent and overly sweet sauce on your meet does not disguise the horrible quality of meet you are using.  Server was a douche that night too.  He took forever and didn't bother telling us they had a special that night, which made their overly priced crappy food a bit less overly priced.   I was very tempted to give this place 1 star but after reading the reviews of how fun it is to drink there, I decided I wouldn't completely bash the place without having experienced half of what they do.   Your merciful critic, Mike V.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Theodore S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",41,255,88,2.0,3/11/2012,"This place has gone downhill since I left Thousand Oaks. I used to eat and drink here once a week on Monday's during football season. I came here with some old friends recently and will most likely not come back again. We had 3 different bartenders and no one seemed to know anything about customer service. I was prepared to have a few beers and some appetizers but instead I was forced to have 1 beer and a sampler. I had to get the manager involved in order to get my bill to leave. She gave me a huge discount, but with service like the kind I had I should have been comped. Maybe this place is better when they have less bartenders and servers with more people to serve. This place is dissapointing. I give them 2 stars because they used to be awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Jaclyn H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",28,58,1,2.0,5/28/2012,"Good riddance, Fridays! Every time I go (or went here I should say) it's been the same thing, slow service and being stuck there much longer than I would like to be! I would try and enjoy my time there with my mother for their 2 for $20 deal which was okay. Decent appetizer and meal that arrives on a moderately hot plate and a dessert on a cold one. Can't really complain about bar food, you get what you pay for right? But shit! Service was so slow It would take forever for us to get any refills on our beverages and they didn't even get the drinks right on our bill! Really? I don't think either of us ordered a Palmer. So by the time we got the bill and wanted to get the hell up on outta there we had to wait for forever for them to come back with the correct bill, then wait forever to get the debit card back. Processing our payment was just as slow as our shitty service. Oh not to mention they didn't even listen to us. The food runner had dropped the burger bun on our floor and my mom said it's fine, and not to get another one (she doesn't eat any bread) and the runner comes back with another one anyways. Cause we want some dumb loner bun just sitting at our table. Since it was so busy I wouldn't be surprised if the food runner probably circled around the place and brought the same floor-bun back to my mom! This was an almost decent place for eating but far from a GOOD memorable experience for dining!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Brittney W.,"Camarillo, CA",53,14,2,4.0,1/27/2012,"I am an addict to TGIFridays. I have only ever had one waitress that wasn't the greatest but I still got my food on time and it was delicious. The drinks are good and worth the money. My favorite appetizer and meal would be the crispy green beans with the wasabi ranch and the sizzling chicken and shrimp plate with mash potatoes and chopped bell peppers and onions... Yum yum yum bottom line: great food, great drinks, yummy dessert if you can get to that and reasonable prices. And terrific service!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks
Christi C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",31,20,29,3.0,5/4/2011,"Friday's has gone through a number of restructurings over the years. When it's good, it's very very good. When it's bad, it's awful. Sometimes it's just mediocre. There's never much consistency in service or quality, so it's hard to gauge them accurately. Overall I'd say it averages out. They must be doing something better because the last few times we've gone, everything has been good.  It's kind of a hokey place but I must say my favorite dish has to be the Jack Daniel's Chicken, I get it nearly every time I come here. The quality of the food has ebbed and flowed as well, for a long time their portions were chinsy and tasteless and overpriced...they even had some kind of limit on much sauce or ketchup you could have with your meal!  We do come here quite a lot regardless because it's a step up from Denny's. So far, so good now, it seems like they're back on par for the time being.  We usually get seated right away, but I don't like coming here during the dinner rush because the noise level is terrible, it's not bad enough to be stuck in an area with someone's screaming kids in your ear while you're trying to talk and eat, but then you have to contend with the drunken sports fans hollering at the bar over whatever game is on at the time. And it happens every time! Not exactly a relaxing environment, but I guess that's why most people order a Margarita the size of a bird bath with their meal.  If you come here late night after an event it's usually a good place to be because it's one of the few places in Thousand Oaks open late and the crowds have died down, but you can be as loud as you want with your group because it's practically empty.  Some of the prices are a little high but if you sign up for their Give Me More Stripes program you get coupons emailed to you practically every week which can make dining out a lot more affordable if you have a Buy One Get One deal or take advantage of the 3 Courses for Two People for $20 Special. The desserts are really good but a lot to eat on your own, so make sure you split it with someone. Overall, Average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks

Julian S.,"Fillmore, CA",22,17,3,1.0,2/28/2012,"The place was dead when we sat down, everyone that got there after us got served food before us. It must have been the fact that we weren't drinking.

Madeline G.,"Fullerton, CA",84,646,,3.0,7/21/2011,"I had no choice but to come here. I hate Fridays, and if were up to me, I would have chosen somewhere else...but this is where the friends wanted to go. Im just glad we got to spend time together :) Nothing was bad here...I just don't like the cheesy, chainy, suburban vibe. I don't know why. It's just too corny for me here. Reminds me of Office Space and flair and phoniness. There are too many original and quality places in the world to spend your time at Fridays. I will say the happy hour is awesome though...especially the one in Compton of all places. Yay for afterwork drunkenness!! Fun place to come with friends, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here on my own.

Wilmar D.,"San Diego, CA",462,333,175,5.0,6/30/2008,"Hey Friday's.  I just came back from you.  Megan started our tab and John finished us off for the night.  I have to say that you guys are totally bomb.  John is just so fucking chill and easy to talk to, and he explained how the Friday's sweet and sour mix is their very own, and he let me try it straight to appreciate it and compare it to the store-bought alternatives.  And I've gotta say that the Friday's sweet and sour is among the best I've had.  No wonder your Ultimate Long Islands kick ass. Yeah it was pretty dead tonight.  Besides me, Michael S., and his co-worker, there were only three other guys at the bar around 10:30 PM, but it was chill enough to have a good time just talking about random stuff like high school GPA's, really touchy-feely annoying girls, and natural disasters.  But the fact that I had such a good time even despite the lack of human activity going on tonight is a substantial indicator of something going really well in your formulas, so don't change anything. 5-dollar Ultimate Long Islands during happy hour...

Kimberly Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,54,,3.0,3/21/2008,"Yeah, so Friday's isn't the most glamourous place ever. Their food is the equivalent of Chili's, Applebee's, and the like. However, Friday's French Onion soup is the best french onion soup I have ever had. If I'm not hungry, I'll come here just for the french onion, it's that good.

I swear last time i came with my family of 7 she tried to sit us at a dinky round table made for 4 people, and when i spoke up she shot me a dirty look. They also got all of our food orders wrong and never even apologised, she acted liked we were inconveniencing her.

Bobby B.,"Newbury Park, CA",1,130,6,2.0,7/23/2010,"The Service, a D-:  So I received a $50 gift card and decide to use it for take-out for me and my family. I hate when chain restaurants like this don't have pricing on their websites and the 'pricing varies by location' crap is lame. Wake up TGIF, it's 2010. Surely you can give a range or (gasp) actually go through the trouble posting each and every location's menus with prices. . . Nah So I call my local TGIF and tell Evan, who answers the phone, that I want to place a to-go order but I don't know the prices. He says Oh go to our website and -I stop him and say I'm there and there are no prices. He says Please hold on. Yeah, 10 minutes later, now Allen comes on and I say where's Evan?  Allen is very nice, professional, and apologizes, says he can help me right now. So I go through some choices and pricing and place the order. We go over to the restaurant and as a side note, it was a FRIDAY at Fridays at 5:30 pm, and Deadsville, USA. TWO people at the bar, and 3 tables occupies for dining! After tongue lashing my inept friend, Evan, I locate Allen and he's very nice to me again, I pay and leave. The Food, a D-:  My Santa Fe salad was mediocre. I do not like my lettuce shredded as done for a taco topping, I like leaves mostly intact. The rest was the same, all small diced-the onion, avocado, tomatoes, a few black beans, tiny tortilla chips strips and some corn and really tiny diced chicken. NOT worth $10! Ugh. And the chipotle dressing has no personality, it tasted like mayo and ketchup and some cayenne pepper powder. My son enjoyed his ultimate burger.However, I ordered it medium but no pink was visible. He disliked his over-salted fries, which I tasted and my BP immediately went up 50 points. My daughter's turkey burger was okay. No way the meat was a fresh patty. Her fries were also too salty. Not worth the $8.29.  Sadly, it was the appetizers were on the whole the biggest rip-off. The potato skins: skins with some cheddar and little bacon and tasted very bland. Way over-priced at $9.00. The pork potstickers were oh so out of a frozen bag, again over-priced. I don't get the TGIF appeal. Even without the Jekyll/Hyde service experience, the food was unmemorable, small portions, and too expensive. People buy this glop in the frozen section of the supermarkets?? I am so glad I did this as take-out and didn't have to tip anyone or pay extra for some presumably lousy beverages, too!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks?start=20
Kristina K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",206,112,6,3.0,9/27/2008,"It's Fridays...you know what to expect! Get the ultimate long island at happy hour and bonless buffalo wings  with a side salad to stay cheap and easy, like me! ;) They seem to have a new menu or additions to the menu every time I go in these days. The key west shrimp and the kung pao chicken dishes are really really good, and something you wouldn't expect at TGIF. Other than that, the menu is generic ""THAT PLACE"" material.The service the last few times we have been has been horrendous! Takes forever to get anything. Last time, we even got free (COLD) fries to ""make up"" for the fact our waiter actually ""FORGOT"" to put in our order!  Cathy is good though if we get lucky enough to be put in her section. And Jeff at the bar is attentive and great (Thurs nights). The prices can be too much for my liking for this kind of place if you don't go at happy hour, and their special pricing only applies AT THE BAR, not in the booths next to the bar...beware! Once we had to get up and get our own drinks at the bar 1 foot away from our booth to save like $30 on alcohol!

Charity K.,"Simi Valley, CA",69,148,17,3.0,7/25/2011,"What is it about Friday's? It always seems to be super slow. We went to this Friday's after seeing Harry Potter. It was kind of late, but not too bad. The restaurant was practically empty, but yet, it still took a long time to get our food. To clarify, my dad got mac 'n' cheese. My sister's boyfriend and I got a dinner salad, and my sister got a bowl of soup and breadsticks. My dad got his first, and we waited at least five minutes after that to get our salads and soup. So, we waited about 25 minutes to get the food I described! That seems a bit extensive to me. The food at Friday's is always mediocre. This was no exception. The breadsticks were not baked consistently, and my dad said his five cheese mac 'n' cheese was really boring, and he loves mac 'n' cheese. The servers are always very nice, and I have always enjoyed sitting in the bar with my friends. Since the service is so slow, we know we won't be disturbed. I would never recommend Friday's if you are in any sort of a hurry, but if you just want to relax, have a drink, and get some dessert, Friday's works. One last note, the prices are generally average, but the calories are often off the chart. While they are probably comparable to others, it seems like they are really high for what you are getting a lot of the time. For instance, their dinner salads have about 100 more calories than the average as I have noticed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-thousand-oaks?start=20
