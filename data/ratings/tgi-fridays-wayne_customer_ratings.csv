29,Jenn S.,"Clifton, NJ",12,13,,4.0,2013-03-12,"I don't normally frequent ""chain"" restaurants, but sometimes it's convenient-and I do happen to like TGI Fridays menu for the most part. At this location, food is always good, service is always friendly. It is clean and inviting.  This past visit, my friend and I ordered the flat iron steak which we both requested ""medium."" However, when they came out, they were clearly well, well done. It happens once in a while and we were about to flag down our waiter, but before we could, one of the managers came over. ""I noticed you didn't look happy when cutting into your steaks."" We politely told him that we had ordered medium and that these were clearly well done. ""Yes they certainly are,"" he said. ""I will get you some new ones. I completely understand, I am a medium rare guy myself, and you did not look happy. Let me fix this for you."" Our steaks came back, he had us cut into them in front of him and they were perfect. It's very rare for chain restaurants to have such attention to detail. Most will begrudgingly fix the problem if you ask, but not many will notice there is a problem before you say something. Service gets 5 stars. This will keep me coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=40,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

The food is fairly standardized and while some places have better specials then other they are about the same.  I came here with a friend to just have a bit and a few beers. I think i had one beer, and one of our two apps never came. We weren't charged for it but a little annoying. The waiter that night might have also hated his job. He made a few jokes but told us out right he didn't want to be there.   Food was good, so cant complain but im sure it would have been as good at any other friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

He gave us a nice booth in the bar area. The atmosphere shouts ""IT'S FRIDAY!!!"", even though it was Thursday. I had a strawberry milkshake, which was really good!  The thing that I wanted to emphasize which really bothered me was when some of the waiters came to sing happy birthday to my friend. The looks on their faces gave the impression that they didn't want to be there, or they didn't want to sing happy birthday. They were clapping and singing as if someone were forcing them to!   I know it may sound a little silly, but if it's your birthday, your special day, you would want it to be more special. You would want them to be more enthusiastic about it. I mean if they are going to sing happy birthday, please do so with some kind of smile or interest-be considerate!

I would definitely go there again, and again, and again. What's more, and this may seem minor to many, they're tostitos and salsa were absolutely wonderful.

6,Morgan G.,"New York, NY",92,110,6.0,1.0,2017-02-21,"Oy, Friday's. I came in on a Saturday during early happy hour with my husband to meet a couple of our friends for drinks and a quick bite. Easy, right? I've been to this Friday's before and had an okay experience at a table in the bar, but sitting at the bar this time, the experience was completely reversed. There were three servers behind the bar but for some reason, we couldn't get ANY service. When we finally did, we didn't order anything crazy (I don't think).. Glass of wine, one specialty cocktail, a beer and a black & tan.  The wine glass was dirty and there was debris floating in the bottom of it.  Almost like it was  used for sangria, and there was leftover fruit in it.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I was at the end of my glass.  (GAG.)   We brushed it off and tried to order some appetizers and a second round of drinks, but the waiter kept walking by us without even so much as glancing in our direction, and we sat right next to the servers' entrance to the bar.  With three people behind the bar, and the bar seats only about 70% occupied, there's NO reason we should have waited 15-20 minutes to flag him down for refills. Bartending 101 - if a glass is empty, ask if they want a refill. The more we drink, the more the bar makes. If we weren't already on a time crunch, I would have just bounced and went to Bahama Breeze for better service and quality. Anyways after 20 mins, my husband finally flagged him down and he looked downright ANNOYED and even huffed a little bit. (WTF dude?)  My husband ordered boneless wings, and we got an order of mozzarella sticks for the group.  Drinks finally came out after yet another 5 minutes (so now here's almost 30 mins of waiting for a refill), and the wings came out with the bone-in instead of boneless. I get it - restaurants get busy, people make mistakes... but when you have multiple people behind a bar, leave 4 customers (who could easily have spent $25+ each if you let us) hanging dry, AND provide dirty glasses and mess up an order WITH an attitude? Bye, Felicia. We aren't coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

38,Chris D.,"Franklin, NJ",21,31,,1.0,2017-02-25,"To start with they really need to clean there both area walls and all. The wall paper was starting to come off the wall at the section me and my wife were eating in. The  bathroom had no paper towels, as well as needed a good cleaning. Now let me get to the staff. The staff is very rude. I seen several waiters and waitresses being rude to customers. Our waitress was very rude and not on point. Ask what do they have as far as beer not listed goes. She told me well not much more then that. Our food comes in order  jack Daniels burger should have come with the sauce on the side. I had to ask for it. You would have tho I ask for something special. The whole time we where there it seem like we were a problem to her.  So she didn't get a tip. I hate doing that but she as well as the staff is was over the top rude. As well as waiting way over an hour for our food to come. I will never go back to T.G.I. Friday's again. I don't recommend this T.G.I. Friday's to anyone",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

The place just doesn't wow me. It's dark and cold inside..

12,Kimberly T.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",136,84,442.0,3.0,2017-05-07,"I've been to this branch often as this is the closest one by me. Last time i dined in was with my husband and we usually get an ok service. As usually we enjoy their ribs with jack Daniels sauce. Appetizers here are something i enjoy too especially their spinach dip. But recently, we have been just taking our orders to go. Either via mobile or by phone. They always seem to forget adding the extra sauce i asked for so i when i ordered 1-2 weeks ago i finally checked before i left the place and sure enough the sauce was missed even though the one i spoke to over the phone said ""i got it"". Maybe FORGot it. Lol but anyway that was no big deal for me. However, as i have read some of other yelpers reviews we do have the same complaints, more or less, and that is service from the bar take sooooo soooo long. My goodness. Even though the bar is not full i always ended up having to wait a while. Unfortunately pick up is done there rather then from somewhere easier like by their computer or upfront even when its paid in full already. Their staff is nice and usually friendly i just dont know why they dont attend as fast as it looked like they could. Sometimes i see them chatting and i had to catch their attention or just wait for them to finish. although sometimes id think ""would they have seen me at least from their peripheral vision?"" Lol guess not. But anyway i hope they let their staff know about this or probably change location as to where food pickup should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

Now onto the $10 unlimited Apps~ we got boneless chicken wings with jack Daniels sauce, dumplings, potato skins, mozzarella sticks, and the barbecue chicken flatbread! The only 2 that were ok were the skins and dumplings, everything was horrible! They had one waiter Adam, the kid was trying to handle every table on his own so therefore everyone suffered, we waited for Apps (which arrived ice cold)  and asked for another drink which he didn't bring until we were done trying to pick through the worst appetizers ever! Everything has that fake quality and definitely microwaved! Will NEVER waste another 10 bucks here!!! Also would like to add the Drink/Cocktail Menu has no prices!!   Save your money and time!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

My friend notice workers were hanging out by soda machine. What got me was host didn't even ask why we left or even bye or have a good one. Never again I will eat at this place.

Very nice of him.. entrees come.. wife asks for a steak medium, it comes out looking like a piece of charcoal. Sister in law gets a salad, another mistake as it has brown lettuce.
