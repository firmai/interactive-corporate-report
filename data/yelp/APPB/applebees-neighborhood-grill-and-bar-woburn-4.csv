Kayleigh E.,"Reading, MA",1,5,,5.0,10/22/2017,This is one of my favorite restaurants ever!!! Always feel welcomed when I come here. Our favorite waitress is Danielle who is always nice and really knows how to make your experience here great and is great with little kids. Also Kenny who will sing to music with you and make it like you are having a party and not just at a restaurant. Eddy was really nice and always happy and made us laugh so much. Steve who was our waiter once was really nice and was a really good waiter. The food was delicious my favorite thing to get is the fiesta lime chicken. And the service is amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Alyssa L.,"Reading, MA",0,1,,5.0,1/2/2018,This is my favorite restaurant to go out to eat with my friends and family. I always feel welcomed by all the staff. My favorite waitress is Danielle because she is always checking in on her tables and is a very nice person. Danielle is so sweet and will get you whatever you need.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566,5.0,4/15/2017,"Always a great experience from Applebee's, but the Woburn location was exceptionally fantastic!  Between TC (in training), Sara, and Dan (the manager), everyone who works here is always in a great mood and the most interested in pleasing all of their customers by providing a clean space, a healthy menu (well, not like some other chains), great bargains (the 2 for $20 menu is great!), and great service!  Onion rings, burgers, steaks and more, everything is delicious, decently sized, and perfect for a full meal. Miles better than some other chains of this type and the service is so fast. Sara, our waitress, was just so happy, funny, and kind. She completely brightened up my visit to this restaurant.  The restaurant is large in size and composed of a bar, tables, and booths. The ambiance is perfect for families as well as couples or even a group meeting. Casual dressing and never too long of a wait.  Comfortable place, and something on the menu for everyone.  Separate parking lot is a nice gesture, and ever a few to go spots.  Wonderful place to get a decent dinner meal in the Woburn area. 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Brenda W.,"Woburn, MA",0,11,,1.0,4/20/2017,"Ordered takeout. It's never been this bad before. Got a 6oz sirloin, skewer of shrimp, baked potato. When I opened the potato, after noting they have gone back to salting the outsides (bad idea, too much salt, & the skin is where all the nutrition is) I found black parts through it. Managed to salvage about half. No need to buy such low quality potatoes, too many that are high quality at good prices to be chinchy.  The state was ordered medium, it was very rare. Char on the outside, in the center it was blood red & very cool. Again, shouldn't happen in a place with a good reputation. The shrimp was so undercooked I didn't trust them (my favorite part too), they were barely translucent. My husband will nuke them to death for lunch tomorrow. This Applebee's has gone down hill very rapidly. Have no idea why. But, they better change their ways or they won't be around much longer. I could have saved my dinner & presented it to the board of health, as unhealthy cooking. But, this time I didn't.  Even my frozen steak teriyaki rice bowls at lunch are better, they only cost $2.50. Their broccoli is beautiful, tender crisp, bright green, these were limp looking & faded.  Applebee's you used to be so good. What happened?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Perry S.,"Woburn, MA",131,25,,5.0,5/17/2017,"I received a gift card to Applebee's for my birthday.  Usually I stear away from chain restaurants (having worked in one myself) but my boyfriend and I figured we should use the gift card and take a night off from cooking.  From the moment we walked in, Sam was outstanding.  She greeted us with a smile, told us about the special deals of the night, had an extremely positive attitude, and gave us the best service I've recevied in quite some time. Being in the business myself, I am a huge critic when it comes to service.  Dining at higher-end restaurants and receiving mediocre service at best, has become sort of a norm for my boyfriend and I.  But Sam is one of the best servers I've ever had.  As for the food, it's an Applebee's, you get what you pay for, but both of our meals were pretty tasty!  We will definitely be back to see Sam!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Adam S.,"Framingham, MA",27,1,,4.0,6/4/2017,"Every time I have been there Kenny has been amazing on the bar. As well Jen D who was serving and Becky who was on the bar. Kenny is always spot on when working and makes everyone laugh. He goes above and beyond. He even helped as a host and sat people, even brought out delayed orders for tables! Also great suggestions from the menu to everyone at the bar. Becky makes a great drink when on the bar and makes sure your food is out in good time. Jen D was training on bar and did a great job too one of the times I was there. Granted this was over multiple visits.  No bad words for this place. Slightly biased, but kenny is amazing and needs a raise! He could be a manager. But knowing the industry, give that man a good raise and he makes that place so much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Dan C.,"Boston, MA",3,71,119,4.0,7/3/2015,"I've been here three times in the last month and don't understand the terrible reviews. Applebee's is pretty much your typical pub food. Love the 1/2 off appetizers after 9pm til closing. The wonton tacos are so good. I never would have considered ordering them without the recommendation of Kenny. Also, the chicken quesadillas have been hearty with tons of meat. Service here has been terrific in my experience. The waiters make light conversation while tending to your needs. One time an order of fries arrived to our table late and the waiter generously took it off our bill. The way I see it, Applebee's at this location is much better than most others I've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Steve H.,"Watertown, MA",51,107,58,2.0,12/10/2015,"I have to say that I was disappointed with the food quality at this location, the potatoes were under seasoned, the steak was over seasoned.

Brooke P.,"Woburn, MA",82,10,,4.0,10/31/2016,"There's one reason I'm singling out this location of Applebee's among all its other locations: the bartender, Kenny. His spot-on recommendations and sense of humor were the reason we stayed for a second drink after intending only to pop in for lunch. The food was typical Applebee's fare; it was hot and reasonably tasty for a fast-casual lunch. Our server was extremely friendly and checked on us often. This may be the first Applebee's I ever return to as a regular simply to partake in Kenny's repartee and extensive drink knowledge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4
Shelby G.,"Bentonville, AR",26,201,198,1.0,3/7/2016,"This place sucks. The service is poor. I waited for 5 minutes to even get seated, 5 minutes for the server to acknowledge our table, and 30 minutes for food to come out. I realize this is not a 5 star restaurant, but I had higher expectations. Drove by the other night and the sewer was backed up in the parking lot, just another day at Applebee's! The only reason I want to go back is out of convenience and the fact that I can walk there from home. I hope this place goes out of business and they put a nicer restaurant there... Like a Burger King. My friends and I now affectionately refer to this place as pooplebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4

Karen S.,"Davis Square, Boston, MA",43,7,2,1.0,8/16/2015,"I would have given 0 stars if I could for service.  Our server's name is AMANDA M who at that time spent more time sitting on a booth, and rubbing the legs of another female that waiting on tables.  I pressed the ""call server"" button on the self-service tablet to get her attention, since she has not been back to take our orders (we've been waiting 10 mins). She just looked back from where she was sitting (with her GF) and took another 10 minutes to get back to our table, and then SNATCHED THE TABLET off our table. THIS MADE ME BELIEVE THAT SHE GOT UPSET OVER ME PRESSING THAT BUTTON ON THE TABLET. Our entree came after 10 mins, and our appetizers came 20 mins after that.She has been rude for the rest of our stay.

We came in at ten on a Thursday night and somehow still waited for at least five minutes for the hostess to show up. Our waitress was very inattentive, to the point where we could have easily dined and dashed, were we the type of people to do something that dishonest.

Butch L.,"Woburn, MA",0,3,,3.0,2/19/2016,"Late one night, I decided I would stop by my local neighborhood Applebees for a bite to eat. Some of their appetizers are half price after a certain hour, so I decided on the boneless wings and the quesadilla appetizer.  The quesadilla was not bad, but nothing to write home about. The wings on the other hand were just flat out bad. They were also really small, but that might have been a blessing in disguise. What was I expecting from going to Applebees at 11pm and ordering wings and a quesadilla though? All that said, they do have the best kiwi lemonade I've had since Nam. I'm not much of one for giving out ratings, but if I was hand-delivered a subpoena and called to the stand as a witness in a court case involving my experience at this Applebees, I would give them a 6.3/10 rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4

We got seated on uncomfortable high chairs and saw that there were 4 booths available right next to us.  Please don't sit people just so your waitresses don't have to walk 5 more feet.

Justin N.,"Burlington, MA",0,7,,1.0,12/5/2014,"I'm done with this location, for good.  I'll start with the highlight: the manager is a pretty swell guy, and always makes things right. That's seriously the only compliment I can muster about this place. I grew up on Applebee's as a kid (and it shows), so when I moved into my current apartment and had this location up the road, I was thrilled: free Wi-Fi, decent food, acceptable prices...I thought it'd be a good hang out joint, like everywhere else I've lived.  I was wrong. In the few dozen times I've been here, I have: *Had a waiter ignore me for the better part of half an hour before the MANAGER took my drink order.  Yes, I mean actively ignore me, as in he gave me a look of disgust before passing by every single time. *Repeated orders have had ingredients missing, been dangerously undercooked (which resulted in not one, not two, but THREE DIFFERENT INCIDENTS of food poisoning between myself and my friends) or overcooked to a crisp *Bill has been wrong multiple times, including the most recent incident where the waitress swapped our bills despite our very clearly separating our cards and tabs (mine was pinned to the OUTSIDE of the billfold with a pen, his was wedged inside the billfold) *Serving sizes of the sides vary wildly; one day I had enough fries they covered my chicken, the next visit I had maybe twelve to fifteen individual fries in total *Staff attitudes vary wildly.  Some staff love me, know my order preferences, and get everything out piping hot and ready to go.  Others really just don't give a fudge and will let my food sit in the kitchen until it's ice cold, and have the audacity to cop an attitude when I call them on it. At this point, the location has become a joke between my friends and I.  We've all gotten sick from it, the food is barely passable by *Applebee's* standards (and that's saying a lot!), and the fact the manager has to make quarterly rounds to make sure -everything- is okay with -every- table just speaks to how bad the rest of the staff tends to be (with a few exceptions - they know who they are, I hope!). I'm done here.  Never, ever coming back to this location ever again, maybe not Applebee's anywhere again.  At least Chili's is dependable with their food service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4

Jon B.,"North Andover, MA",75,5,2,2.0,1/22/2016,"Food: 3.5/5 Service: 1/5 Our experience at the Woburn Applebees tonight was pretty dismal. Overall the food was pretty good but not perfect. The burger my brother got was overcooked, he was specifically asked if he wanted it pink in the middle or not and there was no pink in sight. Our friend's steak was ordered rare but was warmed through instead of simply being charred and served. Fried chicken tenders were overcooked to being hard even for a fork to pierce and overall the portion sizes were underwhelming. I wish I could say the food was the worst problem we faced. Service was incredibly slow. Even recognizing that it was a Friday night the restaurant was not that busy and there were service people everywhere. Our first round of drinks arrived after our appetizers, and we weren't offered a second until halfway through our entrees which showed up after our entrees were finished. A dessert was brought to our table that we didn't order and while eating dessert my brother requested a mountain dew which took forever to show up. Finally our check was delivered and we waited at least ten minutes before it was picked up. One could blame the delay on the alcoholic beverages on the bar but everything else service-wise can only be blamed on the wait staff. I have been to this Applebees many times over the years and this is by far the most disappointing experience I've ever had. The standards have certainly dropped over the years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20
Mary D.,"Billerica, MA",0,8,,1.0,10/7/2015,The quality of food is not good. I got a steak and it was chewy and fatty basically couldnt eat more than I paid for. My daughter got chicken and it was rubbery you could probably bounce it off the table. Its not just this location its ALL Applebees the quality of food is horrible - the 99's and Chillis have such better food and its in the same category as Applebees. I dont know what it is at any Applebees Ive been to but it takes forever!!

Jesse R.,"North Reading, MA",0,3,,1.0,5/17/2015,"My family and I went there and the food was mediocre (overcooked steak, bland food, etc).  The service was horrible.  Although the waitress was pleasant, she would disappear for periods of time.  When looking for her a couple times during our visit I noticed her coming out of the kitchen... somewhere she didn't need to be for her job.  At the end of eating, I waited 10 minutes (already was there for nearly an hour and a half for our meal), then decided I was going to have to find her if we wanted our bill so we could leave.  Come to find her in a little sink area off to the right of the kitchen with another couple waitresses chatting up one of the teenaged boy ""cooks"".  So the few times I had to wait at least 5-10 minutes for drink refills, fixing a order, and the bill... it appears she was too busy chatting up a boy rather than doing her job.  I am the type to let things slide once, but constantly having to watch for her so I could flag her down before she disappeared again got frustrating.   Fix the service and the food and you might have a decent place here, but it is obvious that is the whole business... and management of this place is failing miserably.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20

Mark D.,"Salem, MA",0,1,,1.0,9/3/2015,"Let me preempt this review with one side note. I CREATED a yelp account just so I could warn people about this establishment If I could give less than 1 star I would. My experience here was nothing short of abysmal.  I went in for lunch with 4 of my co-workers today at 12:00pm. We get seated and our waitress comes up to us and takes our drink orders. No problems with the drink orders, they arrive shortly. We then put in 5 simple meals: 4 hamburgers (MEDIUM) and 1 shrimp scampi. Once we put in our order we wait for no less than 35-40 minutes for our food with not ONE mention or apology from our server. She did not come by once in the 40 minute wait to inform us about where our food comes. Finally, our food arrives at almost 1:00pm only to find out that all four of our MEDIUM burgers were charred to a crisp, almost inedible. We immediately ask for the check, wanting to end this experience as soon as possible. The server comes back and rudely mentions that she ""so kindly"" deducted 10 dollars from the bill because of the ""slightly over cooked hamburgers."" At this point, we were all late from our lunch break and in more of a hurry than before. We quickly give her our cards and she proceeds to mix up our charges not once, but TWO times, taking close to 20 minutes. Finally after about an hour and a half of nothing but inconvenience, we pay our bills and leave. We were not apologized to once throughout our entire meal, or even asked if everything was OK. I've been working in the Woburn area for over a year, and this is by far the worst restaurant experience I've had to date.  All in all, I will not be coming back to this restaurant for lunch again, and I strongly advise you to do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20

Wendi X.,"Tewksbury, MA",3,103,6,1.0,6/19/2014,"The lay out of this restaurant is crazy..the front door is a good walk away from where you park the cars.. With that stated if you are handicapped or temporally handicapped (meaning being injured) do not come here...why you ask..let me explain..my husband was on crutches. We saw someone come out of a door where the ramp is where you would park for handicap and the call ahead pick up curb side food order. So, I go and drop off my husband here. Get him all and let him start to hobble to the door while i go and park the car. When I get to the ramp I find from him the door wont open. So, we kinda waited for someone to exit..mm no one...so I told him to stay so I would go in and go over to the door and go open it for him cause it was a very long way for him to hobble over to the front door.  When I get in there I get asked right away how many I told them the handicap door is wont open. There answer is this...ready...yes we know it is locked, we have to keep it locked..What???? That makes NO SENSE...So, why even have a handicap ramp..oh wait I get it.. So, you can give it an illusion that your legally following the laws and screw the actual handicap people... All I have to say is shame on you and I do hope one day that you have to be on crutches and you have to travel that lengthy parking lot.  As for the wait staff, she was friend and prompt in the beginning but no one came back and asked us is everything was ok... As for the food it was fair...very greasy fries & onion rings (which they forgot to included with the order), the burger was cold and over cooked/dry... Then to top it all off - we exited out of the handicap door cause that was allowed, but when I went to retrieve the car some friggen idiot keyed my car..

Casey C.,"Woburn, MA",0,38,5,1.0,6/4/2015,"I get it, it Applebee's. I wasn't expecting much and they manage to deliver even less than that. I went mid week, mid day, I'm thinking / hoping it must have been shift change over. We got there and we were seated very quickly (the place was close to empty) by the nice hostess and we told our waitress would be right over, about 10 minutes later she did arrive and took our drink orders, I tried giving her our meal orders but she walked away too fast. A few minutes later she returned with our drinks/ took our orders and that was the last I saw of her. I'm not sure where she went but it would have nice/professional for her to say ""I'm leaving for the day and (name) will be taking over from here on."" Someone else delivered our food. No one checked on us. I needed more dressing since the chicken tenders on my oriental salad were so over cooked and tough, i was hoping a little dressing would soften them up and one of the people I was with ordered her meal with a side of rice, which was cold. Not sitting around and cooled off cold, like took right from them fridge and put in a plate. Gross and inedible. So we finished our food (the parts that were semi hot/edible) and sat, and sat and sat some more. Then a young man came over and cleared our dishes. Then ANOTHER young man asked if we wanted dessert, my friend did want to look so we said sure. And he walked away and returned 10 minutes later with the check. Not the dessert menu. The check. So my friend again asked him for the dessert menu and he brought it over. We picked a fried Apple cheesecake thing. Not too bad, but after a crummy meal they had no place to go but up. Again, I get it , it's Applebee's. I wanted something quick (that didn't happen) and semi-tasteful (Hahaha...not even close) but i guess that was asking too much. No worries, there are plenty of other restaurants around here that I just will go elsewhere for here on out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20
Katherine R.,"Bedford, MA",0,8,,1.0,2/26/2014,Tired of being shorted. I love Applebee's white queso so I order some to go every few weeks to enjoy at home. Originally I was getting 4oz for my $1.50 - a great deal. But then it switched to 3oz. A bit disappointed but I understand the economy. The last few times I've gone however I've only gotten 2oz for my $1.50. They've basically secretly doubled the price and shorted me 9oz of what I've paid for. If they tried giving half a meal for full price they'd be in quite a bit of hot water but they seem to think this is acceptable behavior. Nope. Customer lost forever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20

Jason B.,"Sandwich, MA",286,560,36,3.0,5/12/2011,"Applebees is Applebees.  It is what it is. A step down from the Nines.  Draft beers, bland-ish, uninspired bar food, and a ""pieces of flair"" vibe on every wall.  You've seen one, you've seen them all.  I give these guys a third star because of their commitment to charity.  They have a ""30 wing in 30 minute"" challenge.  For 5 bucks, you get 30 HOT wings.  If you can finish them in time, the restaurant donates 10 bucks to the Jimmy Fund.  If you can't, then you donate 10 bucks to the Jimmy Fund.  You show me someone who doesn't like that deal, and I will show you someone I will never be hanging out with.  By the way, the record time is 14 minutes and 52 seconds.  I asked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20
Matthew A.,"Rockingham County, NH",717,1990,1299,3.0,4/10/2009,"This Applebee's is always busy and hummin. My staff and I come here for happy hour every few weeks to sit back and relax afer a crazy day at the office.  It appears that others have the same idea, as about 4:30 it is always packed at the bar area.  I love that they have Blue Moon on tap.  Also the manager gives us discounts for coming here as an after work group. I can  not remember if if is free appetizers or 10% off food, or something like that. It is good that the restaurant makes an effort and treats us well.  The parking lot is always busy and full so sometimes you have to park in the Stop & Shop plaza across the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=20
Tommy C.,"Winchester, MA",0,3,,4.0,2/16/2015,Applebee's was amazing my buddy got the sampler which was overwhelming and I went with the 4 cheese Mac and cheese with chicken tenders which was fantastic.

Kate R.,"Ashburn, VA",1,34,4,1.0,7/24/2010,"I've been to this place a few times now. The waiters have always been friendly and are usually fairly quick. It also has a small parking lot that's easy enough to get to. However, the food is fairly subpar, even for an Applebee's. The one I normally go to back home has waaaaay better quality food.  The first time i went, the steak was overcooked, even for 'well done'. The second time i went, the food was okay... and this last time i went, i got lukewarm fries that tasted like they'd been out for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=40
Pamela M.,"Medford, MA",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2014,Horrible food horrible service.  Had the Mac and cheese with chicken.  The chicken was bad tasted like it had been frozen for way to long before cooked.  A frozen dinner would of been better.  Should of know the food was horrible when a delivery guy showed up from another place delivering food for the staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=40

Frank L.,"Danvers, MA",18,27,2,2.0,9/17/2013,"Went in for lunch and got one of the signature combos with Oriental chicken salad and Blackened shrimp pasta. Not awful, not great just blah. The pasta was overcooked, the shrimp smelled and tasted of the freezer and the salad was ok but you could count the chicken pieces on it with one hand. For fuel it is OK but not up to par of other Applebees in my opinion. On a pleasant note, the server was delightful, friendly and competent so I will come back for a drink at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=40
Susan D.,"Pasadena, CA",108,494,38,2.0,9/16/2009,"First off, I am laughing to myself because the photo associated to this restaurant is inaccurate. Anyways I tried the 2 for $20 deal, which was uninspiring and just lame. The waitstaff was nice. The spinach dip appetizer was okay with really thin sad chips. My fried shrimp were puny cardboard breaded ""seafood"". And I didn't even want to try my hubby's chicken and rice dish. Nothing was particularly bad with my experience. It was just not that great either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=40
Katie C.,"Winchester, MA",3,43,,1.0,1/1/2011,"Tried to go here on Thursday but after it took them over 20 minutes just to get our drinks, we said "" NO WAY!"" and left. Seriously, over 20 minutes just for drinks. I understand they get busy but for drinks! So we watched the waiter completely ignore our drinks sitting on the bar for over 10 minutes before an assistant manager went over and grabbed them and covered the waiters butt and finally gave them to us. It was probably about 25 minutes for a jack and coke and a sangria. I was not appreciative of my drink being abandoned at the bar unattended for over 10 minutes. I mean Im sure there aren't rapists in Applebee's but still its not a safe practice. Save your money and your time and go somewhere else.  When the waiter finally came over to us, no apology, nothing (literally about 30 minutes later). the waiter was frazzled. Then we had to get change, but he was too busy to take it. So we found an assistant manager nearby because we were sick of waiting and when she came back with our change 5 minutes later  we told the assistant manager that we weren't eating because of the ridiculous wait for just the drinks, She offered to take our order but we were over it. This isn't the first time the wait has been ridiculous here, and the food isn't anything amazing anyways. Not going back again. Seriously, know your busy hours and get sufficient help.very insulting to get treated that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=40
David C.,"Woburn, MA",14,29,4,1.0,6/25/2010,"So you know the drill-saw the add got seduced by a specifically yummy looking burger,,,,, So in we go, and the place is not really that busy.  Couple big groups drinking these particularly wild ""Budzillas,"" which are these huge 128 ounce containers of Bud or Bud Light for $19.99 3 person minimum- but I digress. We ordered an appetizer, Queso with Tortilla chips and the aforementioned Philly Cheese Burgers we came in for. The we sat and waited and waited and waited.  Eventually our waitress made an appearance, and when she inquired about our appetizer, she having a brief moment of clarity announced. ""OOPS, I guess I forgot to put it in-and smirked like it was the most humorous thing that happened to her in a month! She then without feeling the need for an apology slid into another brilliant move, ""Do you still want it?"" We told her we did so she assured us it would only take a few seconds (25 more minutes, and don't you know the Burgers came within seconds of her leaving.  The burgers were good- the Queso for all the work was metsa- metsa  (melted cheeze wiz and Rotele.)  Not one more mention or apology about her slip up.  Lori Paid the tab and gave her a 10% tip- I would have given her a dime myself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-woburn-4?start=40
