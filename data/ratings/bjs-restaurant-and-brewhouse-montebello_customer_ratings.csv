620,Laura R.,"Whittier, CA",6,117,1.0,3.0,2012-01-02,"My best friend invited me to dinner with her daughter.  She suggested BJ's and I agreed.  I had only been there once before, but had always wanted to come back.  I ordered the parmesan chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  When it came the side of broccoli consisted of like three tiny little florets.  My friend asked for more and they did bring some but I just kept thinking of that scene in the movie Road Trip with the pancakes and the horror stories my brother Vince told me about his days working in McDonald's. I always try my best to be nice and polite to my food handlers for fear of retaliation. Just saying. So the food was good, and my dessert was even better.  A baked beignet with a scope of vanilla ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream...interesting take on the strawberry shortcake. It was delicious.  All in all, I couldn't complain about the food or the service.  I hear it gets really crowded at night and that you might bump into someone you know if you grew up in the area, but I didn't see anyone I recognized. The hamburger my friend's daughter got looked really tasty and I guess it was with the way they devoured that thing. All in all it was a good experience with some good food. There are a couple of dishes I wouldn't mind coming back to try, oh yeah and that baked beignet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=560,2.96,2.98,2.98,2.8280000000000003,2.972

393,Dana T.,"Daly City, CA",721,16,,2.0,2012-01-23,"I've been to a lot of BJ's and have always been treated with great service, but this restaurant came up short in the service department. It was not a great experience. The hostess wasn't very professional. It seemed like she was new and didn't know what to say, nor give a very good seating selection when there were clearly many other open tables that were much better than the corner we got. It felt like she seated us for the convenience of the waitress, who was also waiting on the three tables directly next to us. The waitress took way too long to get us water while we needed to buy time to figure out what to eat. It felt like a 5-10 minute wait for her to come back with our drinks and take our order. She didn't even serve us our food, instead a food server came out with our dishes. The food was pretty good, though. I noticed most of the workers were busy with their own side conversations and seemed like they didn't really enjoy working there. I like going to BJ's for the great dining experience and atmosphere, especially considering the $$ price tag you pay for most of the food. Maybe I was spoiled by other BJ's with their great customer service (Chino Hills and Irvine), but this BJ's is definitely the runt of the litter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=460,3.0,2.98,2.98,2.6000000000000005,2.9880000000000004

Our asses were barely settled into the chairs before she came back and demanded that we be ready to order. NO. So she huffed and puffed away. My friend got take-out for her boyfriend and requested that it's prepared at the end, but we got that order before any of our food even came out. The waitress barely came by to check up on our table throughout the meal, and we didn't get a single refill on water until we asked a different waiter for it. Then she forgot to give my friend the birthday dessert thing people get here. When we got the take-out order at the end, she gave it to my friend without a bag. REALLY? I hope this silly bitch enjoyed her tip. Can't believe I actually had my birthday here a few years ago. Would not have wanted her to serve 20 people, since she's barely able to handle 3.

Literally, eat bite I take into my awesome buffalo chicken pizza lightly drizzled with ranch, there's John right beside us asking if everything is okay.  Why this BJ's location suffered from 1 star shy away of perfection was due to the waiting time and the poor front desk service. It took us nearly an hour to be seated when we got there around 10PM and they close at 1AM. The front desk personnel appeared to had a much more greater time ignoring us and smoking/joking.

Service is pretty good here, and even though its at Montebello Mall, I can appreciate that the mall is upgrading itself from its old school Raider Nation days and added this restaurant in addition to Marie Calendars.  I was here for a party and the catering was great with spaghetti and pizza. Came on my own, and still felt the pizza was good, but their salads are amazing!  The cobb (minus bacon) is soooo good. I love that they dice the salad so small that you don't have to take your knife to it just so you can fit it in your mouth. Its chilled perfectly that it just makes you want more. The same goes for their BBQ chicken and caesar.  Their appetizers are pretty good, mostly i enjoy the artichoke / spinach dip and Santa Fe spring rolls. I'd skip out on avocado rolls unless you really really love avocados, and I do mean really.

607,Carina K.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,,2.0,2012-02-28,"This Bj's is definitely one of the worst I've ever been to. First off the service is hit or miss. I've had terrible service as in the waiter drops off the food and never checks back to refills our drinks, to very attentive friendly waiters. But the biggest issue for me is the quality of food.  First off it seems that every time I go there's always something that goes wrong with my order. Every time I go I expect for my order to be screwed up. It falls in between asking for a side of Ranch Dressing multiple times, which isn't really a big deal, to them not topping an order of nachos with chili, the bottom of the plate was covered with it. When I flagged down a waiter and asked if that there was supposed to be more chilli the waiter with a straight faced confirmed that yes, that is how the dish is served and walked away without offering anymore assistance. Obviously, chili goes on top of the nachos, a fact they overlooked somehow. For a restaurant known for its pizza they served a Great White with marinara sauce and not white sauce. It wasn't until later that I realized what was wrong with that pizza.  For some reason the food seems off. I don't know if its the inexperience kitchen staff or what but the taste of the food is different then from others I've been too.  Due to these reasons and examples I have since refused to go to that Bj's. It has been a constant stream of mistakes that they don't catch or refuse to correct. It had gotten to the point where when I went I expected something to go wrong. Don't mistaken me, I have gone to other Bj's and have had the complete opposite experience. Maybe with time, and better management, this place will get better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=620,3.36,3.1,3.1,2.248,3.2040000000000006

330,isaac b.,"South Gate, CA",12,8,,1.0,2012-05-21,"This is a review of my experience at this location that i left on BJ's Facebook wall. Just want to share my worst experience ever at a BJ's restaurant. Last thursday, i called BJ's Montebello to place an order to go (mini pizza, grilled chicken salad, pasta and 3 soups). That was at about 11:05, 5 mins after opening. They took the order down fine and said it would be about 20-25 mins. So i drove over, got there 25 mins after i called. They said the food would be a few mins, i said thats fine and took a seat. About ten minutes after, they came out to tell me they dont have the soups i ordered. Also that their computers were down. Fine, i cancelled one soup and replaced the other one with a soup they did have at the time.  As all this was happening, several customers came in after me, picked up their food and were out. So i had now been sitting there for about 20 mins. I eventually had to get up and ask for my food. They said, since our computers are down, we cant remove the soup from the bill and just stared at me, maybe just waiting for me to say thats fine? The employee helping me had a very poor and rude attitude. I could tell she was very frustrated, but that is no reason for them to take it out on a customer, especially one that has been waiting for over 20 mins for food ordered over 45 mins before. So she eventually took the soup off the bill by using a calculator like i suggested, she took a carbon copy of my credit card and just handed me my bag. No sorry for the wait, sorry for the inconvenience. Nothing! I did not receive a receipt, and to top everything off, when i got to my destination, The chicken on the grilled chicken pasta was badly charred, and no i did not order the blackened chicken, and they did not throw in the side of buffalo sauce i ordered for my pizza, which was also made very sloppy.  I have been going to bj's for years, and only once or twice been disappointed, but i have continued to go, because of the awesome food. But after this, it will be a long long time before i go back to a BJ's restaurant. And i will NEVER go to BJ's Montebello, even if lunch is paid for by a friend.  Please take a look into the opperation at this location. My sister, for whom i bought the food, also says she's had poor experiences at that location. Her and her husband also refuse to eat there.

Bad service, disagreeable food, worthless experience. Came in around 9:30pm, group of 4, as a hang out. Ordered drinks, all good. Ordered the wedges fries to start off and the others ordered a ""Pizookie"". Why did it take over 40 minutes to get some fries and a cookie?? And the restaurant was rather empty! I had considered ordering an entree but the wait and unappetizing options on the menu turned me off. We got the fries and pizookie after what felt and was very much likely an hour. You could taste the frozen storage inside the hot yum-looking fries-- Not fresh, not cool! The cookie was good but what hot cookie doesn't taste good? The ice-cream was forgettable. My friend got ugly oranges on his Blue Moon and when he ordered a second one, I'm sure our server forgot after 20min. about it and the bartender brought it over.  Don't plan on coming  back...

A new guy who was ""training"" seated us (you can tell he was really nervous but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  We came here for lunch today because I saw an ad in the newspaper for Party for Two deal for $19.95. You get a choice of 2 salads or soup, a medium pizza, and a pazookie to share. The pizza we ordered (combo) was bleh, it didn't seem fresh, tasted like it was sitting out for a bit before they brought it to us. My bf ordered a turkey cobb sandwich and received a turkey club. He ate it anyways because he didn't want to have to wait for them to bring out the correct order.

She came back with the form and said to fill it out and let her know when I'm done so she can scan it. I was expecting her to explain the program to me but she just dropped it off and walked away. It seemed as if our waitress didn't care to be there or maybe she just didn't want to wait on us. Her answers were short and she always ran off before we could ask her anything.  We ordered our pazookie and boxes for our leftovers and waited for the waitress to clear our table, she dropped off the pazookie and boxes and didn't come back until we asked for the check. There was no room to eat our dessert, I had to start stacking the dishes so we could make some room at the center of the table to eat it.

I like this establishment, I have a few problems with this place sometimes; but at the same time they try to remedy it. I feel so confused about this place because my overall experience here can't be described as consistent. FOOD QUALITY: Do I like their food? Well.. yes. I think they're above-average quality in their pizzas and most of their dishes. Clam Chowder is always a delight to eat. Pizzas are pretty large (but not the best tasting). Sandwiches I feel could shine more if they tried; they taste and feel like average sandwiches. Open-faced burgers are HUUUUGE and flavorful; their pastas are unique but I feel are overpriced. Jambalaya is super oily for sure (thank you andouille sausage.)  To this day I still don't know how or why their baked potatoes are monstrous-sized.  To this day I still think PIZOOKIES are the best thing to eat here.  SERVICE: Hit or miss! I do notice that a lot of times my waiter/waitress disappears for some time to the point where I feel like once I have his attention I have to get everything I want done in one go or else I will never see my waiter again. ENVIRONMENT:  It's pretty spacious in here. Dark. Loud & noisy. Seating is generally comfortable but I disagree with a few of the table arrangements because I dislike having to look forward only to see a family eating in booth seat.  It's very convenient to have a BJs at the mall, so I'm glad that it's just around the corner to deliver some quality dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=280,2.6,2.96,2.96,2.6399999999999997,2.8160000000000003

254,Garen A.,"Montebello, CA",487,679,2009.0,2.0,2013-06-28,"I'm sorry, but I was so disappointed with the service I got here during my last visit that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.  The meal started off just fine. The waitress seemed involved, and we were seated relatively fast, and it all went downhill from there.  Let's start with the food. We shared a hand-tossed buffalo chicken pizza. The new-ish hand tossed pizza isn't bad, but the deep dish is way (and I mean WAY) better. I wouldn't bother with the hand-tossed. The flavor is ok ... I personally think BJ's puts too much buffalo sauce, but that's just me. I also had a side Caesar salad with chicken. It was pretty bland (I've had much, much better).  Now for the service. First the waitress completely didn't understand that I wanted the dinner portion of the caesar salad. There were four of us, we were all sharing the pizza and getting salads as well (cuz two slices of pizza isn't enough for me in my hungry mood) ... we all just ordered the salads we wanted (didn't specify dinner or side) - she brought two of us dinner portion salads and the other two side portions. Who brings two people full salads and the other two side salads - makes no sense to me - and if the waitress was confused why didn't she just ask us to clarify.  Anyway, so because she thought we wanted side salads she brought those out way before anything else (leaving us to deal with the awkward waiting until we start eating to be courteous) ... then we waited another 20 minutes for the pizza, and another 20 after that for the other two salads. At one point it had been so long since we'd seen our waitress that we just assumed she'd kidnapped by previous angry customers. The best thing was that she said the delay was due to the fact that they were 'making' more chicken (though apparently they had enough for the pizza and my salad) ... none of this makes any sense.  I won't go on ... needless to say I was really disappointed. It wasn't even that full of a night (if your service is horrible on a Wednesday, I don't want to know what Friday night is like).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=180,2.6,2.84,2.84,2.408,2.744

That's just cruel .. We were seated promptly. The boys went to grab some beer at the bar since there was still 10 minutes left into happy hour. Our waitress was meh. No one else said anything about us bringing beers back to our table but she gave us a hard time - probably because she wanted our bill to add up so she would get more tip. Our food came out in a reasonable time -- 20 minutes or so for the deep dish buffalo ranch pizza. It was just okay. Asked to connect a empty table right by us since we were expecting 2 more people. Our waitress said she would ask and never got back to us. We asked another server and he came back within minutes to help us connect the tables.

We called about 10 minutes before walking in and gave our name and how many folks were in our party.  They said there would be no wait when we got there.  Walked in and gave the name, and they said they don't take reservations, so we waited 10 minutes for a table to open up. Waitress took our orders, but we never saw her again for the rest of the night.  Our food was brought out by other servers, and for some reason, one of the kid's orders didn't show up until 10 to 15 minutes after everyone else was served.  I even had to ask another waitress where his order was before it finally came out. Again, our original server was never to be seen nor did anyone come to check on us until we were almost done with the meal. Finally, a new server comes over and starts taking care of us, but never did advise us of any shift change, nor did she even introduce herself, but hey, we were getting full at that point, so I let it slide. Then, it happens...... The power goes out in the restaurant, and we are sitting there for 45 minutes in complete darkness with an ear piercing piezo fire alarm and flashing strobes.  In my younger years, I would have ordered a couple shots and enjoyed the light show, but we were busy catching up with our relatives.   The waitress comes to the table and advises us that she will have to manually calculate our tab and asks us what we ordered.  She returns with the homemade receipt and advises us that we are only getting charged for the entrees.  That the drinks and appetizers would be waived for the inconvenience.  Considering our drink order consisted of 3 kids drinks and one adult drink and 3 waters and the appetizer being calamari, I gladly accepted the discount.   Handed over a large bill and again sat in complete darkness to wait for the change. Waitress comes back and hands me the tab folder and quickly utters that she found my ""correct"" bill and quickly walks away.  I open up the folder and see that I was billed full price ""for the inconvenience.""

We were immediately seated so we were really happy to start off with. Who gets seated right away in a BJ's on the weekend, right? But we should have known better than to get all excited because we didn't have to wait.  After being seated, we had to wait a good 20 mins for our server.

I'm sorry, but I don't like eating cold pizza. I would like to have enough time to finish my soup. Anyway, we took a look at the pizza and saw the pineapple was missing. The server came along and we told her the pizza didn't have pineapple. She said she could bring it on the side! Who eats pineapple like that? A side of jalapeños, I understand, but pineapple?  We told her it was okay and that we don't need it on the side. We finished eating and then played the waiting game again. It took her 40 mins to show up at our table. Till then, the server helping the table next to us got our ranch, chilli peppers, and water. Our server showed up and we ordered our dessert. We got done with that and we waited again. After 20 mins, she came with our bill. How much was the bill? 46 dollars. This time I didn't even bother waiting for her. I just called the other server and told her we had ordered the 2 for 20 deal.

We came at 6 and the line was already about 30-45 minutes long...I guess there's a lot of early hungry shoppers. The employees were nice and helpful, and the menu selection is extremely vast. I got an ahi tuna salad, and for the most part, it was enjoyable. However, the tiny dabs of wasabi were extremely strong--I know they're dabbed on the sides of the plate, but I didn't see it til I swallowed the first one clinging to a random leaf. I would suggest transforming it into a dressing or doing something else to alleviate the strength of the wasabi--I love wasabi, but this was pretty intense. Also, there were several slices of tuna that tasted overly fishy...to the point where I wanted to gag. I really didn't want to finish the rest of the fish in fear I'd get another bad slice, but I just swallowed and hoped I wouldn't get food poisoning.  The bf got a deep dish pizza, and he LOVED it. The toppings were spread all the way to the edges of the crust, and the fluffy dough complimented the rest of the ingredients perfectly. Verdict? It's okay...moreso for the bf than for me. Personally, I wouldn't want to come again because I keep thinking of those nasty slices of fish, but the bf definitely wants to return.

I have been in this industry for 20 years and for her to tell us that we were wrong and continued to say it over and over was......  Well we stood up, turned around and slowly walked to the front door. I know she saw us leaving and did nothing to stop us, or try to fix the problem. In stead she cleaned off the table and waited for the next guest to insult.  I understand that it is busy and that you maybe a bit stressed, but as someone in the   Service industry you should always handle yourself in a professional manner. One should never make the guest feel bad or sorry that they walked in the door. Bottom line is we are there to spend money and a good time if BJs can't deliver we will go somewhere else. We went across the street to Applebee's. It is really sad when my community and local restaurant gets such a bad review.

Also to the management that hires these people please don't settle find the right person for the job!!

Food is actually really good, as long as you stick to what they do well. In this case the shining stars of the menu are the pizza (both deep dish and hand tossed), the chicken wings, and their burgers. Unlike a traditional Chicago deep dish, the BJ's deep dish takes a more California take on the recipe, meaning it's more doughy, yet still crispy on the outside. The burgers here are also surprisingly good, especially the newer ""Brewhouse"" varieties. Everything else here is about average, except the pastas. For some reason, I've rarely heard good things about their different pastas. So it's best to steer clear. Service is always good, but can feel a little stressed during busy periods. This location gets VERY busy during weekday lunch, so either arrive early or be ready for a short wait if you come for a weekday lunch.

We had a great experience. We went again this year, per her request. The hostesses were great. After that it was the worst service I've ever received anywhere. It took 40 minutes for us to be able to order. Then once the order was about to be put in, one of my guest suggested we should change the crust of a pizza. The server, Raquel, rudely interrupted our conversation, demanding we tell her right then and there what we wanted. I told her I would let her know when we were done discussing the issue and I would let her manager know myself. Her tone changed immediately. At this point I thought she was already overly rude and asked her to leave the table. As She walked away she said ""I knew this would happen"" loud and clear for my 15 person table full of family to hear. This was so embarrassing to be disrespected in front of my whole family. Then I went to speak with the manager to let her know I wanted another server. I walked into the server bad mouthing me. Then the manager slightly acknowledged me. I went back to our table the manager came and explained she was the GM. put a New server on our table, who we rarely saw. She gave us 3 pizookies and 10 dollars off a 300+ bill. Thanks! Oh yea and they kept some kids vouchers we didn't use after all.

I don't know why, but whatever, bring me my food!! *I understand that the calamari rings are fried, I've eaten them plenty of times. These were disgustingly drenched in oil. It was more oil than calamari GROSS! * Clam Chowder was good in salt and flavor. * The shrimp scampi had more than 5 pieces of shrimp which was awesome! The taste of the sauce was a little off, it had that burnt taste to it. Since I was hungry I ate some and took the rest home.  When we were done the girl brought back the check and kept standing around for us to pay, i thought that was a little rude, especially since we weren't done with our food and drinks. Once I was done paying She brought back my receipt and was out of our sight. We left 30mins after that. I never once bothered to check and see if my credit card was back in my purse.

What kind of card is it? What are the last four numbers on the card? What are the last three numbers on the card?... IS IT MY FUUUUUU**ING CARD OR NOT?????

The waitress was nice took our drink order so when she came back we were  ready to order. Keep in mind we were starving & wanted to order right away. No time for chit-chat, lol!  For the appetizer we got the artichoke dip, entrées were as follows : grilled chicken pasta (didn't disappoint) turkey club (good) & herb thyme chicken w/veggies (my mom loved it)  We waited about 25-30min and still no appetizer, I was beginning to wonder.!! Then here comes our entrées. I asked the waiter about the artichoke dip and he stated it was still being delayed  because it was made fresh. My thought was.... by getting the appetizer with the entrées defeats the purpose of ordering the appetizer. Specially if we were starving.!! Then comes the manager who was the nicest person and apologized for the mix up and offered to comp the appetizer and  threw in a free pizookie!!!  Bottom line,.. I understand mix-ups happen in a busy restaurant & it's up to the managers to keep the customers satisfied. I was very pleased with him because he went above & beyond to fix the problem.

317,Lexi C.,"South Pasadena, CA",131,85,27.0,2.0,2014-09-16,"My girlfriend and I decided to come here on a Friday night. We usually don't do dinner on weekends and forgot how crazy it can be which is totally understandable.  I got there a bit earlier than she did so I checked us in. The main host girl, who was not very friendly or welcoming let me know it was going to be a 20-30 minuet wait and handed me a pager. My girlfriend arrives, we get to chat, next thing you know 30 minutes are well up. Since our pager hadn't gone off we decided to check and see what the holdup was... As we walked up we took a quick glance and it was apparent there were quite a few tables open. My friend speaks to another host girl and explains that we have waited over the quote time. She looks confused. Speaks to the original unfriendly host girl who quickly rolls her eyes and said we're just gonna have to wait. Second girl says ""well it's probably going to be another 25 minuets or so.""  SQUEEZE ME? No little missy. That's where you are mistaken. We have waited over your quote time and now you're telling us to wait longer?? Manager please! Manager heads over to quickly rectify the situation. THANK YOU. Within the minute we are seated... Why??? BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OPEN TABLES! We sat and quickly ordered. I should have started a count as to how many times the hostess walked by and threw dirty looks. If I had a dollar for every time it could have paid for our meals. If we weren't that hungry (or already waited that long) after a long day @ work we could've easily gone somewhere else. If your hostesses don't know how to quote times properly, trust me you're losing business!! Get new girls. Server was good, but unfortunately my food came out about 10 minutes before my girlfriend... Mehhh. I threw in an extra star because it's inexpensive, and I like the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=220,3.04,3.0,2.964,2.216,3.0160000000000005
314,Eric O.,"Laguna Hills, CA",236,219,53.0,1.0,2014-09-18,"I had just come back from being out of town, and was craving a pizza from BJ's. I happened to be in the area and decided to go here for dinner. I was quoted 10 minutes, but I think I only waited 6 minutes at the most. So far, so good, right? Jessica P. was my server, and visited my table a few minutes after I had been sat. I noticed she had a large party, and several two-top tables, and it appeared she knew one of her tables personally - a lady with a small child in a rainbow tu-tu - as she was spending quite a bit of time at their table. She took my drink order and asked if I was ready to order, but I advised I would get an appetizer, but needed a few moments to look at the menu. Well, I definitely got those few moments - 8 minutes to be exact. That's how long I had to wait for my drink. I didn 't say anything, but kept that in the back of my mind. In fact, during the entire 8 minutes I was waiting for my drink, I didn't see Jessica at all. After I got my drink, I noticed BJ's had some skillet appetizers - so I ordered their equivalent of Texas Cheese fries - shoestring fries, cheese, jalapenos, pork, and verde sauce, so I placed that as an order stressing I was ordering this as an appetizer, and would order dinner later. Jessica acknowledged this and went to wait on other tables and place my order. A few moments later, I finished my Pepsi, and set the empty glass at the edge of my table - a universal sign I wanted a refill. Remembering how long I had to wait for my initial wait, I made notice of the time, and watched and waited to see how long it would take for a refill. It took 9 minutes for her to bring me a new drink. During this time, I saw her talking with the lady with the child in the rainbow tu-tu, and lean at the server station at the end of the row of tables chatting with several servers. She glanced over occasionally at her tables, but that was it. Finally, after about 7 minutes, she walked by my table, noticed my drink was empty, as were all three drinks at the table next to me, and made the comment to both tables, ""I'll be back with drink refills for you"". In the meantime, my appetizer came out, and still being without silverware, I asked someone for silverware, which they brought out to me.  A few minutes later, she brought drinks to all of us, and when she dropped my new drink off, she glanced at my empty glass - I watched her make eye contact with it - and then walked away, leaving the empty glass on my table. Gee, thanks. Because my table isn't tiny already, you're going to leave a dirty empty glass for me to look at. I glanced around at the other tables in Jessica's section and noticed EVERY SINGLE ONE of her tables had multiple empty dirty glasses. Apparently Jessica is not a fan of pre-bussing her tables. To her credit, she DID come by a few moments later and asked how my fries were, and I told her they were good, which was the truth. Although the cheese made my stomach feel weird each time I ate a bite, the rest of the fries were actually quite tasty.  I had now been in the store for about 40 minutes, and Jessica had still not come back to take my dinner order. By this time, I had finished my second Pepsi, and waited to see if she would offer to bring me a refill. She stopped by about 10 or 11 minutes later, after I had finished my fries (I now had a mostly empty skillet of fries, and two empty glasses of Pepsi on my table) and asked if I was good. She didn't ask if I wanted a refill, nor did she ask if I wanted dinner. She just asked, ""Are you doing ok?"" At this point, I just wanted to leave, so I asked for my check. While Jessica left to get my check, I stopped another employee and requested to speak with a Manager. A few minutes later, that same employee came back around and told me a Manager would be stopping by shortly. When the Manager came by, he leaned over, and asked how I was doing. I then asked if Jessica was new, and a look of ""I know what's coming next"" came over his face. I politely asked him to sit down and told him we needed to talk. He obliged, and I recounted my experience to him: my being out of town, craving BJ's pizza, no silverware, the long wait for drinks, no pre-bussing, and most importantly, never being asked what I wanted for dinner.  The manager looked upset, not at me, but at the circumstances which I had experienced. He thanked me for letting him know, and told me he would be right back. I saw/heard him talking with Jessica at the server at another server station, and then he brought me a comped check - taking care of everything ($9 worth of food/drink). I really wanted to have dinner here tonight, but after my experience, I just couldn't stay another moment. The food was incredible, but there was no excuse for the sub-par service I (and other tables) received.  If she was overwhelmed with too many tables, that is on management for having too few servers on hand and/or giving her too big a section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=220,3.04,2.98,2.952,2.18,3.0040000000000004

(Review is for To Go Order only)   Decided to make a to go order for lunch for both my husband and myself this early afternoon. I called to make a to go order before leaving work (I work pretty close by this place) and was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes. This is what we had: Mahi Mahi Tacos- ($9.50 prior to tax) I had the option of having my mahi mahi tacos grilled or fried and decided to opt for grilled (healthier option). This entree comes with 2 tacos and chips (with avocado cream sauce and fire roasted tomato salsa packed in a separate container). I really liked my mahi mahi taco. The chipotle mayo added a little spice to it (which was plenty spicy for this non spicy eating person) but my husband added a bit of sriracha to it. I thought the fish was nice and tender. The shredded Napa cabbage and carrots added a nice crunch to it. The chips were just ""eh"". I have had better chips from the market.  Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad- ($9.75 prior to tax) This salad is pretty good with the different flavors and textures. Not only is there kale and roasted Brussels sprouts but also blueberries, sliced red grapes, dried cranberries, candied pecans, chopped cucumbers and toasted pepitas. This salad also comes with goat cheese and red onions but I requested to omit this. I love the sweetness and flavor from the fruit and the strawberry vinaigrette enhances that light sweetness throughout each bite. My dressing automatically came on the side since this was a to go order, but if I dined in, I would normally ask for salad dressing on the side (don't like my salad swimming in dressing... kind of defeats the whole purpose of eating healthy).  When I arrived exactly 15 minutes later (told you I work close to this BJ's location) after I placed my to go order, it took another 10 minutes to pick up my order since there was a person ahead of me making an order and the computer system was moving slow (according to the employee who was helping me with my transaction).  Making my order to go over the phone was easy, along with pick up. I like that you can also have the option of making a to go order online as well, but I didn't want to use my cell phone data to do that for this visit. (They have free, fast WiFi here by the way). Overall, had a fantastic lunch with my husband at a price that was reasonable.

To set the scene, I went with my girlfriend's family to eat and we were a big party. It was about 6 pm and the place was pretty busy. Waitress came and took our order. Wait time for food was longer than normal, but acceptable. I ordered a buffalo burger off of the ""healthy"" menu choices, medium rare. I was aiming to not totally pig out tonight. Anyway, the food came out, I cut my burger in half, and took a couple of bites.  It was rare at best, but I think it was slightly raw. I flag the waitress down and tell her about it. She says I can have it cooked more or have it remade.  She also suggested upping the temperature to medium. I thought remaking as medium was fine and she takes my food back. While waiting manager (I think his name is Chris, but not 100% since it was pretty loud) comes by, apologizes for under cooked burger, and offers a soup or salad to tide me over. I decline because I didn't want to over eat. Second burger comes out and I cut it down the middle.  It's even MORE under cooked and looks raw in the middle.  My girlfriend brought a waiter (not the one serving our table) and sends the burger back.  Manager comes back and apologizes again. I ask him for a menu so I can order something else (grilled turkey and ham sandwich). He brings my food out and apologizes again. About half way through me eating, manager comes back to check up on me. He offers dessert to the table. I tell him others have already ordered a pizookie and he says he'll make it so we can all share it. I believe it was also comped. The pizookie was upgraded to the large size and it was half white chocolate and half regular chocolate. Don't know if anyone from BJ's will read this but I wanted to give credit to the manager for handling the situation professionally and quickly. I can't thank the manager enough as not all mangers were as nice as him. I also hope he was able to actually see the second under cooked burger I got.

Last time I was there our server came 4 times and we were there for like 3 hours. First time for drinks, second time for food, third time for dessert, and the last was for the check. Maybe it is their policy not to bother their diners too much so they can enjoy their meal in peace or they are just under staffed. Either way, I think they should check up on all their diners more often.  My 3 star rating is mainly cause of the food. First the food takes forever to come out! If you are looking for a quick meal before going out or watch a movie, this is not the place to be. So make sure to grab one of their house beers, which are pretty good, sit back and relax. I have had a lot of different main courses here - pizza, burgers, and pasta. Every main dish I have tried here is extremely salty yet still pretty bland.

The ribs were good, nothing special but edible and soft meat. The pizza was very very tasty got the supreme taste as it should with good looking breading.

The crust was to soft and kinda doughy. The house salad was very good thou. The service was alright, kinda lacked luster. The staff seemed to be all over and it really wasn't that busy. 3 people were just hanging out talking and chat and 3 people where just chatting away in the bathroom too.

188,Medz H.,"Montebello, CA",16,35,30.0,1.0,2015-11-08,"When will restaurants figure out that service is just as important as good food? It seems that most of these places figure that if the food is good then people will comeback no matter how lackluster the service is.  What is even more surprising is when bad service seems to be a regular complaint on yelp and its never addressed. The reason for my rant was, my wife and I know that the service at this location is slow but we were hungry after shopping at the mall and gave in. I honestly have to say this most recent trip takes the cake. Not only was the service horrible, but the food made us stand up and leave( I will get to that in a second.) When you walk into a restaurant, you expect to be greeted in a happy, polite manner. In this instance the hostess never said hello nor made eye contact with me. After standing there for a minute or two I finally said ""I need a table for two"" at which point she asked for my name and putt a pager on the counter. 15 min later she yells out my name even tho I have a pager( which was never used). We get guided towards a table by a someone  who seems disoriented and couldn't decided which route to take. During this this walk she must have asked us at least 3 times how we were doing but kept turning her back to us before we answer, just plain rude if you ask me. We finally get seated and a few mins later a different person came to take our drink and appetizer order, she is friendly! So we give the order and get our drinks... We ordered chips& guac with a side of salsa( not to random) she brings us chips and guac then vanishes. We have no napkins or utensils, and start looking around for help... 15 min goes by and our real server appears ( I have no idea what her name was because she never said it). I explained we needed that stuff and also that we asked for chips, guac and salsa but didn't get salsa... ""Oh you ordered two?""she replied. WTF? No, we were just missing the salsa I told her. She leaves a bit confused and then we see he talking to the nice girl that took that order and looking our way. After a few minutes pass the ""nice"" girl comes and brings two little sides of salsa ( you know the cups they put catchup in) what the hell will we do with this?  We each ordered a mini pizza and side salad. My wife got a caesar which looked like it had no dressing at all and  I got a house with ranch( mine had a dollop of dressing) both were pretty sad even for a side salad. We eat those and wait for another 20-25 mins for our pizzas... They finally show up and both are not fully cooked. When the pepperoni on top of a pizza is still soft and pale colored you know something is off. We called the manager( who was understanding) but who seemed to have this speech down pat! ""Cooks didn't make it right and I'm sorry for the service"".. We offered to pay for the drinks and appetizer but he said no. At this point we left.

One would think that they would have brought out the alcohol first and fast so we would continue drinking. No way!!! Not here.  It's not like the food is to die for.

A few minutes later ANOTHER server ended up bring it out after we started eating our entrees, with no apology or anything. Our server never apologized for the mess up either.  As far as the food, the Eggrolls were bland and tiny, the pasta sauce tasted like something poured from a can, and the sandwich was very plain.  I didn't bother to taste my kids mac & cheese but I can tell you the potato wedges were also quite flavorless.  When we asked for the check he brought it, then disappeared for a long time before coming back to take payment.  We literally waited for him to bring our card back while he was at the table behind us flirting with a group of young girls for a minimum of 5 minutes.  All in all, the service was atrocious, the food sucked, and I would never come back.

34,Mei M.,"Monterey Park, CA",752,120,3805.0,1.0,2016-04-28,"I was very disappointed with the service tonight. One of the reasons we decided to go to dinner there tonight and not Fri-Sun was because we thought it would be less crowded and therefore better service. While the first part was correct, the second part was not. We were promptly seated and abandoned by our server (or so it felt at least).  Our server would disappear for long periods of time. I understand (in talking to him) that 3 servers called in sick that evening. So our poor waiter was left running around covering more tables that he normally does.  We requested apple juice for my niece a few times with our main server, once from a supportive server and once from someone who seemed like a manager of some sort. We waited about twenty minutes for our main server and supportive server to bring the juice. Our main server told us once he had to go check on if and the other time he said he did put in our juice order but that juice came from the bar and they had not done it yet. I know the bar was working...as I saw plenty of patrons in the bar and surrounding tables with alcoholic drinks. Maybe our juice was made a low priority since it didn't make them as much money as the alcohol. After waiting twenty minutes with no juice we asked a manager for it and got our juice in 5 mins, right after our main server finally brought us our juice. Then we asked for soy sauce for my niece's rice, that took another 15 minutes to come up. Tonight's dinner was more waiting than eating which only took away from our family dinner experience.  In the end the short staff was paid by a flustered waiter running around and hungry people at their tables. People hungry either from waiting for her food (if they were lucky) or waiting for their server go take their order (as was a majority of the tables. It would have been nice had management had a contingency plan in place to avoid such occurrences next time so that restaurant patrons don't have to pay the price of the restaurant being short staffed.

She barely looked at me while I stood there and seemed to be extremely upset and annoyed to be there but the second a coworker would come around she was all smiles. I don't understand why she'd be positioned to greet your guests with such a nasty attitude. All she said with a monotone was how many before she brushed us off and said gimme 10 minutes. Maybe you can find a position for her in the back of house. She was about 5'5 glasses, dark hair, dark brown skin when I asked for her name she rolled her eyes. No I'm not lying she rolled her god damn eyes like if I was asking to split a $10 check 17 different ways. She replied in a very annoyed tone and said her name was Marlene.

I was also bothered that a very young couple sat down next to us and he served them alcoholic beverages without asking for valid forms of identification to verify their age before serving them liquor. We got up and went to the hostess to explain what had just happened at the bar with the rude condescending waiter that booted us out of his section. I asked what we should do as far as seating because we still wanted to eat there. The hostess did not try to accommodate us or apologize for that server's actions. We asked for a manager and she ignored our request, but perhaps she didn't hear me....

So I kindly asked our server for some settings. He came back a few minutes with one fork.  I then asked if we can get two settings, with the napkins and silverware.  He looked at me with a confused look, but when he returned with what I've asked for, there was some attitude given back at me. I also asked for some ketchup and Tabasco. It took about 3 minutes to get the condiments.  I understand how servers work.  I also understand how some customers are jerks, but that doesn't mean to push it onto other customers.  I set my glass on the side for a refill. He took my glass hoping to get it refilled.  Nope. I waited over 5 minutes before asking a busser for a refill.

I figured hey, lets give the morning shift a shot.(shitty idea) I went in once for lunch, service and food, sucked. Overall experience 3/10. I went again recently with a friend before engagement ring shopping = meaning he was stressed = wanted a beer to mellow out = bjs = good idea.  That shit turned out to be the dumbest idea we had.

Didnt introduce, no hi, just - sumthin to drink...?...?........................... uh k. We ordered water to start and looked through the menu, she came back again with no emotion whatsoever and totally gave us judgemental stares throughout the entire ordering process.

Long waits during each stage of the meal required proactive flagging down of our waiter or other staff walking by the even get the enough plates or sets of silverware on the table. Drink refills. Getting the bill. Paying for the bill. Slow. Slow. Slow. Fortunately the food came out at a good pace. Thank goodness for that!  Gonna pass next time I considering going to this Bj's location.

Anyways the wait time for a table still takes forever about 40-45 minutes, I wasn't too happy about it but then my waiter Steven came and took my order promptly and he was so polite. I told him I was starving and I wanted to order right away. I ordered the rib eye streak and he came back with little garlic breads and butter since he said the steak would take a while. He was amazing checked up on me more than once made sure I had everything I wanted. They also had a free promotion for a pazooki, I forgot to tell him about the pazooki and closed out my bill. He kindly told me that in order to get the free pazooki I had to let him know before hand so that he can comp it on my bill. I told him It was fine, yet he went out of his way spoke to his manager and got me my free pazooki.

I waited another few mins and another young lady came and asked for my name, said she will be right back with my food. She also gone and never came back. The line was forming and a gentleman came and asked if I need help. I explained that two ladies went missing in trying to get my food and he apologized. He asked for my name, confirmed my order and went back to get me my food.....This time he came back, told me all my food are in two bags in front to the side.

I ordered one so no biggie...but there were only two white containers. I thought both were soup. I then opened the other, also white, but not soup. Yes, it's also mashed potatoes.

85,Charlie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,9.0,1.0,2016-11-15,"I don't even know where to start with this review. First off today is a Tuesday (11/16/2016) the restaurant wasn't that packed so the service shouldn't have been as horrible as it was. My family and I walked in close to 6pm. We got seated and a couple mins later the waiter came and took our drink & appetizer order. We were off to a good start or so we thought. The drinks arrived and the waiter took our entree order. 15 mins later and still no sign of the appetizer or the waiter. Our entrees arrived but they forget my son's plate, we remind the waiter about my son's order and we tell him we no longer wanted the appetizer since it arrived late but he comes back and tells us it's on house (great right?). At this point the service still sucks since the waiter hasn't even offered refills on any of the drink orders, my husband calls the waiter and asked him for refills. Waiter comes back and this is where it all went to shit. I ordered an ice tea, it arrived and I start to drink it but my straw isn't picking up any tea, so I decide to stir it and that's when I see a big nasty glob of slime! If you have ever seen what placenta looks like picture that in your ice tea! That's what the glob looked like. We were so disgusted and puzzled as to what the f*%# this slimy glob was that we didn't take a picture. My husband calls the waiter and asked the waiter what the f*%# that is. The waiter is even more confused and disgusted than we are! He takes the ice tea and says he will find out. He comes back and couldn't tell us what it was but he apologized and said it was going to be taken off the bill! Ummm sorry but NO! You would think the manager would come and apologize and try to make things better. At this point I couldn't even finish the rest of my food. We had to call the manager over he gave a lame apology and couldn't even explain to us what the protocol was when something like this happens. I'm sorry but if it would of been a fly or even a roach in the ice tea at least we would of known what it was but the fact that this slimy glob was in the drink and no one could identify it is utterly disgusting and unacceptable. The meal was comped and we filed an incident report but I rather had paid and not had to deal with this. Never going back again. *Update it's been a MONTH and no one from Bj's has contacted me and that's okay I posted this all over social media and none of my friends & family will ever be stepping foot at any BJ's location.

Service was good, good was great everything fine. Which is what the star is for.  SECOND time I came here was tonight with my family for my brothers birthday. So, we wait about 5-10 mins to be seated which is no problem. Then they seat us at this small table next to the pilar where all the waiters walk so that was annoying. My mom wanted a booth to put her purse so she didn't have to hold it, but we decided to stay.  Then, our waitress comes and says ""I'll be right with you for drinks I just have to greet this other family"" or something like that. And we never see her again. We sit and wait and watch everyone else get drinks, food while we sit there hungry and irritated. Then another waitress comes, and you can tell she was not our new waitress because she took our order on the back of a receipt. We order drinks and food because we've been waiting so long and were hungry.  Another 10-15 mins pass and still no drinks. Finally we get them and we drink, and wait another 10-20 mins now and as soon as we were about to get up and walk out, they bring our food. Then the part of the table that is extra and folded under falls and hits my mom right on her knees. We ask for the manager who had the best attitude of the night and fixed it. My mom asked a waitress for mustard and I promise she looked at my mom like she was from another planet then went ""...yea"" and left. So rude. We ate and waited again for the birthday pizookie for my brother which was not that long of a wait. He eats that then we leave.

First off, my girlfriend and I waited 20 minutes(not bad), but when we got seated, it took us 30 minutes to get our ONLY glass of water and ironically it took us 20 minutes to get our food. But, meanwhile, while we are waiting, there's about 8 hostess up front doing absolutely nothing, one girl was walking around in her phone constantly, and the servers were so lackadaisical. Our server never asked if we needed refills, never asked how the food was, and never had a smile on her face. On top of that, when we were done and ready to pay, we had to wait another 20 minutes. Definitely didn't wanna be there for an additional 20-30 minutes just waiting for our check to be ticketed out. But luckily the ""Manager"" was able to ticket our check. Whoever hired the employees definitely needs a reevaluation on his/her management and hiring skills. The service was so bad it made mediocre food taste horrible and unappealing.

My entree was jambalaya with a side salad of tomato and mozzarella. My fiance ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I would take pics but the restaurants lighting is too dim and I'm not fond of using a flash. Now I usually order the same stuff at every BJ's and sometimes I send stuff back when it tastes terrible. Today though, every single thing we ordered was delicious! Oreo Pizookie was on point as always. Service wise, everything was great! our servers name was Stephanie.

We sat in the bar area in a booth and we ordered our drinks and the waitress comes back to take our order which was 2 calmari, hot wings and small ribs. The server brings one order of calmari. A few minutes brings the ribs then my boyfriends gets up to find the waitress and oops she only got one order after we repeated the order smh then the server brings the hot wings which was supposed to be an order of 10 and there was 8 1/2 .... really! So my boyfriend calls the waitress to show her there is only 9 and a 1/2 of another and she picks up the plate and says I will get you another one with no apology. Then they bring the calamari she forgot and minutes later the wings so by then we were eating cold calamari smh I was irritated and hungry so we just ate. From the time they brought our first plate to the last was almost 20 min! When you order together they should bring the food at the same time. This was my worst experience ever at any BJ's and I would have called the manager to complain but we were running late for a concert in Anaheim. Great wings and cold calamari!

We looked around and tried to flag down a server but were ignored countless times. One worker stood by the pos system while the other 5-6 waiters were on the other side near the stairs just talked amongst themselves while they stared at the customers. Excuse me? My friend raised her hand to get service but instead of being attended to , she was completely ignored by the waitress even though we clearly saw her eyed our table.

152,Amelia L.,"San Gabriel, CA",6,19,,2.0,2017-04-27,"My experience with BJ's has been up and down, never consistent. I had visited this restaurant with my family before and received exceptional service. I don't understand why this time was different. Our female server, don't know her name but she wears glasses, was enthusiastic at first and seemed prompt and friendly, but her attitude gradually fell along with the service she gave us. We ordered two hickory barbecue burgers, a parmesan crusted chicken, a salmon entree, a sandwich, and a large pizza. The pizza was the first to come, which took me by surprise because it usually takes the most time to arrive. Twenty minutes had passed and the entrees started to arrive one by one. I ordered a well done burger and I received medium rare. My dad's sandwich hadn't arrived yet, but the table next to us ordered the same sandwich and his arrived first (even though they were sat 20 minutes after us). I think they made a mistake and gave the sandwich to them instead. After the food arrived, our server stopped checking up on our table. We saw her jumping from table to table, but never checked up on us. We had to wave down a bus boy to ask where my dad's sandwich was because everyone's food had arrived. 30 minutes later, we decided to ask for a manager and he came to our table. We told him that my burger was made incorrectly, and didn't receive the sandwich. Another 20 minutes passes, but at this point our server was avoiding our table because we complained about our service. We thought she did it on purpose because she felt embarrassed. But my question is, she is our server and if she made a mistake, she should be the one to apologize for the inconvenience. Why was she acting like a child by avoiding us. She kept checking up on the surrounding tables, but never made an effort to stop by us until the very end to drop off the check. They took off the sandwich from the bill, but we told the manager there was no need to do that because we weren't looking for a free meal, we just wanted our food. We did appreciate the effort, but it came too late. Instead of making up for it at the end and apologizing, make the moment right and do something about it when the time comes. We could have gone to other restaurants, but we chose this one because of a previous experience. This is unacceptable.

We had 2 different items that came out either with something we asked to remove (no lemon in waters, both came with lemon) or with items we asked for extras of (additional garlic knots). When she brought items to us, she dropped and walked away so quickly we couldn't even get a word in.

Sat at the bar last night and ordered their Santa Fe Entree Salad with Blackened Chicken.  The lettuce in the salad consisted ONLY of the Ribs of Romaine, no leaves!!!  Who the heck does that?  While I realize they may use the leaves for burgers and sandwiches, I hardly think that the remaining ribs should be all I get for $13.75!  I saw a photo on another review of a salad with only the romaine ribs too, who in management decided to tell their cooking staff to do this?  Really poor decision... I think yesterday was the last time I'll ever consider ordering an overpriced salad with poor ingredients here again.  In fact, maybe I'll just go with drinks at the bar, at happy hour or, maybe NOT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=20,2.32,2.48,2.672,2.056,2.416

I go ask again and this time they did bring it out fairly quickly. What made it great.. as we were leaving the manager asked us if the second Pizookie was better. I told him, after waiting over 25 mins .. and he says but was it good? Just not the best customer service. But overall the food was delicious, second Pazookie was better.

I just wanted a quiet meal) She then said, you're by yourself, are you sure you don't want to just sit at the bar? No, miss....I'm 46 years old, and quite certain I know where I want to sit.... So I get a table......and wait....after what seems to be @5 minutes with no one coming over, I set my timer and thought to myself, ""I'll give this place 5 minutes"" At 4:26 (now @10 minutes) someone finally came over - I ordered a diet coke and a flatbread. Diet coke came, someone other than my server brought flatbread (very good, BTW)......I sat with my rapidly empting diet coke with no interaction from server at all - for @15 minutes - server finally came, with check, asking if I wanted a refill, by this time, didn't bother... said no thanks - she drops check - full price for flatbread (1/2 off on Mondays....) - she snootily agrees with me, comes back with corrected check.

I came here on a Saturday to celebrate my mom's birthday. It took ten minutes for our server to take our order for drinks. It took ten minutes for the drinks to show up. We had to place our food order with the hostess (who was extremely nice and far and away the most helpful person) since we were seated in a table near the front. Literally the hostess would be the only person we would see for large periods of time. Drink refills were few and far between and took ten minutes to get.  The food was ok. My garlic green beans did not have any garlic and were burnt. The ribs were good. My mom's ziti had several tablespoons of fat in the bottom. It's probably from the pepperoni that is in it. They don't render some of the fat out or use a leaner pepperoni so the dish was swimming in fat. Wife had the Cobb salad, which she said was decent.  After we were finished eating we asked for my mom's birthday pizookie. We waited and waited and it never showed up. Asked for the bill. Saw the free pizookie was charged to us. Had to have that taken off. The hostess helped to take the pizookie off and she brought us out a pizookie to go with an apology. Our server was slow and incompetent.  With all the negative reviews pertaining to service you would have to guess it's a systemic problem. This stuff reflects poorly on management who I would think is the real problem. Either they don't know how to train staff or they don't know how to schedule their employees (or both).

Place is usually pretty packed on the weekends but if your eating out in Montebello the choices are pretty limited. For large parties I suggest you make reservations or come early and put your name down and browse around the mall. The restaurant has a lot of drunk patrons as well so if that's not the environment that you anre seeking with your family than this isn't your place. Pizzas are really good especially the thin crust. Jambalaya is a bit pricey but that would be my all time favorite! Their beers are awesome and fresh because obviously they brew in house.

We came for lunch and we were seated swiftly.  Our waitress  Kristian was friggin 'AWESOME'!!!!  I have NEVER had as good as service at any BJ's as we did with Kristian in Montebello.   Kristian was extremely warm, polite, made sure everything was perfect and it was genuine, not an act.  I told her that the entire BJ's staff should be trained by her for customer service and how to interact with customers.  Simply the best!!!! We ordered our food and we tailored it to our liking and it came out as ordered to perfection.  This has 'NEVER' occurred at a BJ's for me. The Prime Rib dip was perfect with the sauteed onions and green bell peppers.  Made it close to a Philly sandwich.  It was perfect at all levels.  Taste, consistency, exactly enough onions, and peppers as asked for.  The salads were also done as we requested, perfect. The chicken club was also made as ordered and was delicious.  On this visit, it appeared to be that the QA was finally being watched at this establishment which was so refreshing.

Couple of sever pass by but none of them stop for us. 15 mins later, server came by to take our order. We figured if we order just drinks, she won't be back for another good 20-30mins so we ordered everything at once.  10 mins later, a male server came by to drop off our appetizer. Appetizer came before the drinks... The drinks didn't even come til 10mins after. I didn't like their hibiscus tea. Didn't taste as I thought it would be. Our food arrived about 20mins after munching our appetizer. The presentation and the quality of the food was decent. Since my food was a little greasy, I needed refill on my drink.

56,Vincent Artemio E.,"Monterey Park, CA",66,126,624.0,5.0,2017-09-19,BJ's is an ideal place to meet with your friends especially after work. It's also an appropriate place to meet for a first date because the menu is geared towards small meals or large entrees or simply drinks. It's easy to slip in and sit near the bar or wait for a booth or larger table. The menu is a bit inflated in that there are too many choices. I usually order a seared salmon salad which is always fresh and delicious. The dishes here are not overly prepared or massively proportioned but there are so many choices that you have a difficult time choosing exactly what to order. The service here is excellent. The one time our order was late (very late) the manager came out and explained and apologized to us and provided us with a complimentary item. It was a very busy night and I appreciated that the manager took the time to see that we were satisfied and not feeling neglected. Recommended but prepare for a wait during peak times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello,2.68,2.52,2.608,2.804,2.584

Guess I'll need to switch to a different location.  Called in my order and the person taking my order kept charging me the wrong price several times. I asked for a few extra garlic knotts and they were trying to charge me extra. They had always given me a few complimentary. They said the rule was ""if it's 4 or more, we charge."" I then said, I only asked for 3 extra, but they continued to insist in wanting to sell them to me. I don't mind paying, but be consistent with what you say. They offered to bring a manager to speak to me, and took forever to come out.  I guess the service is reflected equally from the top to the bottom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-montebello?start=40,2.6,2.51,2.608,2.34,2.5460000000000003

My daughter had just finished up a performance that was given by Simon Mall in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month.  We decided to go to Bj's since it has been awhile that we've been there. We were seated fairly quickly as it did not look busy. There were some tables that had large parties but it seemed manageable. Our server was Maria and although she was great at helping us with our son's order, her overall attentiveness was lacking. Again I don't know if she was tending to one of those other larger parties, but I must stress, when she did give us the attention, she was awesome. We ordered calamari and were impressed at the sauces and flavor of this dish. The kids ordered their own pizza and as I said earlier, Maria was very accommodating with my son (he's 2) in ordering a pan style pizza rather than a deep dish. We also had some wings with two sauces. The wife and I got a burger each and it was very filling. Overall we will come back and patronize.

Not sure if they have a crisis in their personal lives or if they're just plain idiots that need to be re-trained pronto in the area of customer service. Whatever the case may be these individuals are too complacent in their role at work. Obviously their IQ level is rather low that they can't quite comprehend that patrons are the ones who pay their salaries and patrons are the reason why their sorry ass isn't at the unemployment line.

She asked if she could just make her a cocktail so my girlfriend agreed since she was  so indecisive. My girlfriend went over the moon for her cocktail! We ordered some appetizers and she suggested some items off of happy hour since it was going on.  The avocado egg rolls were amazing! I would have to say better than CPK.  On my second visit with some friends, we sat with an older gentleman in the bar area.
