It took her another 5 minutes to pour my beer I have never felt so unimportant in a restaurant establishment in my whole life! She was the absolute worst bartender I have ever encountered !

The food was forgettable and it was clear that Applebee's was going down hill, WAY down.  Consequently I avoided Applebee's at all costs for almost the next ten years- until a month ago.  I was taking my 5 year old out on a mom/son date and he wanted lunch.  Our choices were slim and I couldn't do another meal at ""old McDonald's"" so I thought- ""what the heck, one more shot"".  We went to the Hanford, California Applebee's.  I have to say, they redeemed themselves.  Our waitress was a joy and the food tasted good- with real seasonings like herbs and spices- not just salt and pepper.  So we went again about three weeks later and again it was really good- even though our waitress the second time was about as warm as Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada.    So, tonight we went for the third time and THIS is why Applebee's is only getting 2 stars: We waited a bit to be seated which was understandable because they were packed.  Several people walked out.  The host (who was arguably one of the most irritating personalities I've met in a long while) called my 2 1/2 year old a ""baby"" and he got upset- because ""he's a big boy"".  The waitress was OK.  She forgot to bring us napkins FOREVER and we had to ask for silverware AFTER our food arrived.  Then we were finally eating and BOOM!  A hostess walks by and bumps my shoulder dropping an armful of half eaten food and plates on the floor and spilling the food from such plates all over my part of the table, my dress, and me- and my iphone- which ended up covered in salsa.  I can immediately tell she is mortified and having a terrible day.  She apologizes profusely and says she is so embarrassed.  Bro- at this point I'm not even mad.   What made me upset was the fact that SEVERAL of her team members walked by WITHOUT HELPING her.  The manager just stood against the back wall about 20ft away and watched her awkwardly try to clean it all up- as if she were a child thrown into a pool and he was waiting to see if she would sink or swim.  I helped and assured her it was cool.  No worries.  After it's all cleaned up the manager walks over and talks to us- nice guy- and apologizes and asks how our dinner is and we tell him everything is ok.  Our waitress asks if I like the food I ordered and I tell her it's not my favorite.  They graciously bring me a replacement item (which was very nice of them).  It was a steak salad- which I had ordered before and loved.  Well- this time 50% of the pieces of steak (there were 4) were all fat and the salad did not have the same deliciousness previously experienced.  So now I'll never order that again because the second time around it was again- forgettable.  Anyway, I still felt bad for the hostess and was terribly disappointed that no one offered to help her even though several servers and bussers walked right past her- stepping around her as she scrambled to clean it all up.  The crazy irritating host even stopped to watch and assumedly gossip about the situation with the manager as he stood by watching the spectacle as well.   So disappointed.  When I left I told the hostess it was not big deal and gave her $10.  I know what a bad day is like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

In Hanford you have very limited choice unless you want Mexican or Chinese so we wind up at this Applebee's several times a month. In the past I would have probably rated this one two, at best three stars. The foods reliable and the service is okay. However on our last two visits I've been pretty disappointed.  I admit my preferred cocktail is a Manhattan. Pretty simple, bourbon or whiskey, sweet vermouth, and a few shakes of bitters sometimes. A few weeks ago I ordered my manhattan as usual but shortly the waitress returned to inform me that they were out of sweet vermouth. When I expressed my surprise that they had run out of something that used to be a bar staple she said, ""oh, I don't think we're ordering it anymore, it's kind of old fashioned. "" she asked what I would like instead and I declined a substitute cocktail. Now a bottle of sweet vermouth retail is something like $7.00-8.00 dollars. Probably $5.00-6.00 for Applebee's and it has a pretty long shelf life. I told the waitress I hoped they would change their mind and once again stock it. Two nights ago I returned. I ordered a manhattan and was once again informed that they no longer stock sweet vermouth.  We may go back, I really don't know, but not stocking a five dollar bottle of vermouth fells like they really don't care and so I wonder why I should care about them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
9,Vic C.,"Fresno, CA",55,1,,1.0,2017-07-22,"We came here to celebrate our friends birthday and just to catch up with friends. This was my first and definitely will be my last time coming to this location. Our service was pretty sad. Our waitress only checked on us once. We had to get our service from other members of the waitstaff. Which I'll give kudos too, thank you to them for tending to us all the while our waitress was just walking around pretending to work. We hit the ""call button"" on Presto machine and I'm not exaggerating when I say 30min had gone by before I had to ask for the Manager on duty. Unfortunately the waitress wasn't wearing a name tag but she was the only white short female waitress there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
6,Elizabeth C.,"Brentwood, CA",1,3,,1.0,2017-08-23,"First, our server Terry was great. Unfortunately it ended there. My friend and I ordered chicken and steak respectively. We ordered baked potato and Mac n cheese as sides. The sides were cold. Notified Terry who promptly informed the manager and brought us warm potatoes. The manager never even bothered to speak to us. My steak was ordered medium but was very rare and I was only able to eat around the edges.  Was reluctant to send it back because I simply didn't want to bother Terry and it was apparent the manager simply did not care. Also the salt and pepper containers on the table were both empty. Very poorly managed store. The only star is for Terry. Won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
3,Jana E.,"Seaside, CA",5,8,4.0,1.0,2017-10-01,The bartenders are great but the greeters absolutely incompetent! Takes forever to set people and is rude! We requested a table that was open and he put somebody in it that didn't request it! It was a table that we wanted to watch a specific game and work great with a three-year-old!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

To start the hostess who sat us was extremely friendly and very prompt, I believe his name was Joey.  I felt like we waited a decent amount for a Friday night! Our server was straight and to the point which I prefer when eating out! Joey came by occasionally to clear our plates which is really nice because I hate a cluttered table! Drinks were good! Will definitely be back, keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
4,Jeanete O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,1.0,1.0,2017-10-07,"Had to try the dollar margarita special for the month of October , I honestly haven't been to an Applebee's chain in over five years for a reason , and that reason was for the horrible food they used to have for a very long time on the menu , since then my husband and I decided to try it out again and sure enough the food is still horrible my husband had a pasta dish that had breaded chicken strips and macaroni and the strips were glazed with a sweet sauce well it was literally like eating a pancake with an overload of syrup , and I had a garden salad with chili vinaigrette and i had to order ranch instead and even then it was probably the worst garden salad ever it was not fresh at all it seemed like they just opened a bag of lettuce and threw it on a plate ! So to conclude this review I will never go to an Applebee's chain again and you shouldn't either !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hanford-3,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
