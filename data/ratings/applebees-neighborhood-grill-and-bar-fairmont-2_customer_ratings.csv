10,Lisa H.,"Carolina, WV",8,31,13.0,3.0,2014-06-27,I like the food here but the Managers don't care about their customers. You complain about them not only forgetting about your order but also getting the wrong food when it finally gets done and all of a sudden it's your fault!! I am pretty sure they are glad it was a to go order and he was being rude over the phone instead of to my face. His excuse? I must have called another Applebee's. How about this...Maybe your people made a mistake. I will be calling corporate Monday morning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
8,Nikki P.,"West Memphis, AR",12,76,12.0,4.0,2015-07-09,"This was probably one of the best Applebee's I've been to. Friendly, fast service. Our waitress was GREAT! I wish I could remember her name bit she was an older petite blonde woman & she was on the ball with everything. The food was great also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
6,Katelyn H.,"Inwood, WV",79,82,92.0,2.0,2015-08-17,Me & my boyfriend ate here a while back and we got the two for twenty. I got the 3 cheese chicken penne and he got the chicken tenders. When our food came out I didn't get my breadstick and he didn't even get his french fries that came with the meal. We asked our waitress if it came with them and she said yeah sorry I forgot. Then I got to looking at my meal and I had asked no tomatoes on it and they literally put the tomatoes on and then picked them off. I had seeds from them and juice all over the sides of the plate and my noodles. I could taste the juice from them. They are lucky I'm not allergic to tomatoes. You shouldn't just pick them off and if you do you might wanna do a better job of that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
7,Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6253.0,2.0,2015-09-11,"I stopped eating at Applebees more than two decades ago. Meanwhile, in this part of West Virginia nearly everything closes early and at midnight this was one of the few places that was open. We walked inside with an open mind and were interested in trying their new menu. From the beginning we know it was going to be a stretch. The host couldn't figure out where to put us, although he finally decided on seating us at one of the tables near the bar (the restaurant was half empty). We asked the server what was the best choice on the new menu and she recommended burgers and then came out 10 minutes later to tell us they were out of burgers, and a few other things. We left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
9,J. H.,"Ithaca, NY",0,20,,1.0,2015-09-20,"Great service, great food, but from what we've heard, the manager of this joint (or the owner of this particular franchise?) is HORRIBLE to the employees. A laundry list of illegal things are going on. Except for tips, the waitstaff doesn't get paid at all (they get below waitstaff minimum wage, and it is all usurped by taxes) and they do not get regular pay stubs! NO PAY STUBS. They have no way of knowing whether or not their weekly (nonexistent) pay is even correct! They get a W2 at the end of the year, with zero profit, and then they owe MORE taxes on their nonexistent income. This is a NATIONAL CHAIN, they should have their shit together better than this! Unless it's just a problem with this franchise? In which case I hope some upper level Applebee's person reads this review and investigates the illegal goings on at this joint. Because these college students waiting tables for pennies deserve to be treated better than this. Another thing we learned, which is astounding, is that these waiters have to make up for low tips - the money has to come out of the waiter's own pocket if a customer doesn't tip whatever the manager considers to be the expected amount.  Also, waitstaff are often doing double or triple duty - hosting AND waiting tables all at once - then staying late at the end of the night to clean the whole restaurant! Other Applebee's locations hire a cleaning crew. Not these guys. Apparently, they are using the college kids practically as slave labor. And they're getting away with it. This can't be legal. Cmon, people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
5,Angie W.,"Bridgeport, WV",31,108,116.0,3.0,2016-03-13,"I actually like this Applebee's better than the one in Bridgeport.  I have better luck with their appetizers than their main dishes.  I'm a fan of their boneless wings.  Tonight I also got the chicken quesadilla and pretzel sticks.  The last time I had the pico in the quesadilla it was super spicy so I skipped it this time.  The boyfriend got the Chicken Bacon Piada and really liked it.  Bottom line, the food is just okay, but the restaurant is clean and the service is fast and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
4,Bryan R.,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",11,235,155.0,1.0,2016-07-04,"Where to start. Family went here on July 4th for dinner as we are staying in town overnight. Our usual place was closed (damn you!). On arrival it took about 10-15 minutes to seat us. Once seated it took approximately 20 minutes to make contact with our server. I noticed that they were running there asses off by taking orders, serving drinks and food and clearing tables. Absolutely ridiculous, no bus boys, no one dedicated to drinks. I do not blame the servers for anything that happened to us, I blame the management and owner of this franchise. We ordered everything at the same time (drinks and food) as we knew it would take some time. We finally got our drinks at the 30 minute mark and then got our salads at the 45 minute mark and our entrees at the 2 hour make. The sad thing was my food was cold and none of us enjoyed our meals. I noticed multiple tables complain to the manager with no noted compensation given. Shame on the management for try to save a buck on the backs of your employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
1,Valarie J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",229,141,77.0,2.0,2016-12-11,"You only have so many options to have a sit down meal and drink in Fairmont.  We had a funeral to go to then wanted a quick bite to eat. Honestly, the beer was good, but the food was not the best.  We ordered the Blazin Texan and it was literally a burger and a bun. There wasn't much else in terms of toppings. We asked if this was standard and we were told yes that's how the burger comes. I didn't appreciate the answer but I'm not surprised. I ordered a steak and it was not cooked very well. The sides were fine and it was all hot.  The service was good. The service was the only really good part. I think next time we will stick to half priced apps and beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
3,Ernie M.,"Fairmont, WV",11,14,25.0,5.0,2017-01-02,I normally get car side to go food is always good and Dani always makes sure everything is perfect. Food is alway made the way I ask and it's good never had a bad experience here. If you get car side to go and Dani is doing you order you have no worries about you order. I get food from here quite often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
2,HU H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,95,1.0,2.0,2017-05-15,"The waiter, who looked no older than 25, kept calling my mother ""honey"" as if she was his peer. My mother politely corrected him but he kept doing it citing the excuse that we were in the South & that was ""just their way"".  As visitors from the West Coast, we found this very offensive. Employees should be trained to address customers as ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"" if they want to use any terminology. Also, the food wasn't all that great & neither were the drinks. It's been a while since I've been to Applebee's so I wasn't expecting much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
0,Paul Z.,"Fairmont, WV",11,11,,3.0,2018-01-13,Too bad they ran out of oranges early during their blue moon special month. Even with two grocery stores in the same mall the manager did not send out for more. Felt sorry for the servers who had to apologize to customers for poor planning by management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-fairmont-2,,,,,
