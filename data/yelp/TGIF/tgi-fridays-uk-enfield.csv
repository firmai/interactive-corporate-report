Kalpita P.,"Dublin, CA",59,47,36,2.0,6/3/2010,"Bank Holiday Monday I came here with 2 friends for a spot of dinner and enjoy our last evening of freedom, before the work week began. When we arrived, the hostess informed us that there was going to be a 20 minute wait & handed us one of those vibrating buzzers. She said that we could go through to the bar and when a table was available the device would light up. OK, fine by us, we were planning on getting drinks anyhow. We walk in and the restaurant is empty, there were a total of 4 tables in use and the rest are all empty. Did she seriously think that the bar would put me in such a daze that I wouldn't notice the very empty tables?! Clearly, they were trying to capitalise on our alcohol spending at the bar. Not a huge deal to us as we were going to buy a round anyhow, but really shady for those who really don't want to go to the bar. Poor business practice, shame on you TGI Friday's. The bartender was really friendly and he was nice enough to create an off-menu version of their Ultimate Mojito for me. I wanted a Passion Fruit Mojito, so he worked his magic and made me a satisfyingly delicious one! We did wait for about 15/20 minuets before seated at our table. For a restaurant that was pretty empty the service wasn't as fast as it could have been, things just seemed to moving at a really slow lull. The food was yummy and well cooked. I had the Veggie Potato skins for a starter and Cajun Chicken Sandwich with Chips as a main. The portions are sized on American standards - they are big! Your typical American style food options, nothing too spectacular. If you're going to head to TGI Friday's for anything, it should be for their Ultimate drink options and the Jack Daniels inspired menu options. The sauce is delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-enfield
