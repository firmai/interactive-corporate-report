34,Julie S.,"Frisco, TX",108,69,11.0,5.0,2012-07-16,"Ok, it's Chili's- not a typical 5 star kinda place. Please hear me out and have an open mind. First off... The food at this location is consistantly good. It's our kid's favorite place to eat, and the staff always go out of their way to make the kids feel special. When my 5 year old ordered her cheeseburger and ""cob on the corn"" our server never missed a beat.  The service here is really what makes me come back again and again and again. Took my daughter to lunch the other day. It was clear that there was a staffing shortage in the kitchen- I think only 2 cooks showed up. So the orders took a little longer than usual. It was no big deal to us because we had no where to be and I told my server to relax... we were fine. The food was good and staff friendly and ever-apologizing even after I told them no worries. Here's the kicker... I was waiting for the check when my server came over to inform me that it was all on the house. Really? I was stunned. Of course I tipped him and told him that it really wasn't necessary but I was really beyond grateful for the service. I've been to 5 star restaurants where the staff behave like the patrons should feel lucky to be in the same room with them.  This Chili's- corner of 121 and Custer- is really doing something very well. Very little turnover with the wait staff and they really know how to do their jobs.  And they have Sam Adams Summer Ale on tap. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2?start=20,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804

Our waiter (Kenny, I think?) was nice and brought our drinks promptly. We ended up ordering the $20 dinner for two deal which includes an appetizer plus 2 entrees. We had both chosen entrees that were on the list for that that anyway, and the price was a dollar cheaper with the deal, plus we got an appetizer. We got the onion strings & fried jalapeños for our app, which tasted pretty good, although some were a little too doughy. The jalapeños were fresh, not pickled like the ones that TGI's used to have, but were still good. I got the Margarita  Grilled chicken, which I've had before at the Frisco location and really liked. The beans and rice were good, but the chicken was extremely bland. Otherwise, everything else was great.

I know he was busy but the place wasn't packed full of people. Not a huge deal, but he could have taken a few minutes with us. The reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because the bun my hamburger was on was so very stale! I love their burgers, but having a really stale hamburger bun is the worst!

I go there with my family but I try to order healthier things. Last night I decided to be naughty and revisit their awesome burger.  Nooooooo!  The meat was a thick dry hockey puck?  There was supposed to be some new fancy sauce on it but there was none. What have they done?  Ick. I took 3 bites then decided it wasn't worth the calories. Same thing with the queso. What was that thick brown goop?  Gross. I don't even think it had cheese in it?  Nevertheless, the chips and salsa rocked and the French fries were perfect. My son loved his chipotle chx crispers. Our server was awesome!  Great job Tyler!  The place was clean and very busy but we were still seated right away.  The host was slammed but still friendly and kept his cool.

What I really appreciated was our waiter--he was very attentive. I decided in the middle of eating my fries that I wanted a side of ranch.

However, when I tried to pay my bill on the ziosk (that thing on your table that you swipe your card on) it told me that a twenty percent tip on a $34 bill was over $8. At first I thought it was some sort of gimmick to make people over-tip without thinking. The waiter wasn't sure either at first. He came back later and said that he figured it out. He said that it was calculating the tip based on the original chicken enchiladas dish he has brought out. It had been voided from the bill, but the tip meter was still calculating the tip like it was part of the bill in addition to the other replacement dish he brought. Long story short, double check the tip meter. The people, service, and food are good and everything came out promptly.

1,Kaley V.,"Allen, TX",51,4,5.0,1.0,2017-10-14,"Got here at 7:30 and just now at 8:10 got our food. Haven't had a single person come by to refill drinks or see if everything is correct and it isn't. Have asked two people for what we need and still don't have it. Service is optional here.  Also when food came...the blue cheese was boiling hot, almost a gravy. The bone in wings with buffalo has no sauce and taste like bacon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

0,Tiffani R.,"Dallas, TX",126,6,,4.0,2017-11-06,"Checked out the new menu tonight. Had the southern smokehouse burger with fries and the skillet queso. I think they need to go back to the drawing board with the skillet queso. It tastes like canned cheese with a can of Wolf chili. Very bland and does not look appetizing BUT the burger so made up for the blah app. Nailed it. It was so good. I was never wowed before with their burgers although they were never bad. Just mediocre. They've done their homework. Bravo Chili's!!  Burger was juicy, bun was soft with a good taste, the produce was fresh, bacon was crisp and the sauce was spot on. Not sure what it was called. Secret sauce maybe?  Anyway, kudos on the burgers! ( fries were good too). We will definitely be back and won't wait so long next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

And they failed to let us know that any hot desserts they have aren't given hot to go... we only bought it to eat on the road not at home. Before we left the lot we went back to ask them if they could kindly warm it up but they said they don't do that with to go orders. The women would not let us inside and was yelling at us through the doors, definitely wouldn't have too much of an inconvenience to warm up our $20 dessert not to mention we left them a generous tip, I would not recommend this chili's. It may be in a nice area but nothing nice about the staff inside. Going to 380 and 75 next time, never have had a problem with to go orders there. Staff was rude. Food was disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
