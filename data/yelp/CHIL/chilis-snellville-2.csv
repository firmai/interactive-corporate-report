Jones H.,"Stone Mountain, GA",54,89,460,4.0,1/5/2018,"This is one of those places where you really can't go wrong. The food is always delicious. This location had a nice crowd and a wonderful atmosphere. We ordered the two for $35. meal deal where you share an appetizer, get two entrees and share a dessert, oh and get two Margaritas. My friend and I ordered the Strawberry Mango           margarita which was delicious with a pleasing amount of alcohol within it. I love the way the two servers came over to the table, shook and poured or drinks for us with a smile. I ordered bacon chicken quesadillas, they were delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2
Stephanie S.,"Snellville, GA",0,11,5,2.0,9/29/2017,"Worst experience here in a while! I ordered the ancho salmon with rice and broccoli. The broccoli came out covered in black spots on the stem. The waitress agreed it looked gross and took it back to the kitchen. After a little bit she came back and said ""that's how the broccoli comes.""  Uhhh....you mean spoiled? It comes spoiled? She agreed it was weird and offered to switch it out for another side. I decided to get more rice and they brought out this little cup that wasn't even full and the rice was undercooked. I go to the ziosk to pay the bill and they had the nerve to charge me for a handful of undercooked rice.  The manager did go above and beyond in fixing the issue, but if the kitchen can't tell when broccoli is spoiled, I fear for their ability to do anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2
Alex I.,"Orlando, FL",94,7,3,1.0,12/30/2017,I have came here several times after work for a beer and a bite the service is usually great which is why it pained me LITERALLY to write this review. I came inside and needed to use the men's room prior to being seated as I walked inside i immediately slipped into a large puddle of liquid. I came out and informed the waitress who while apologized did not try to reach out to a manager to even have some sort of report written which I would have assumed be standard. I'm relatively young and in good health but had it been an elderly person they could have broken a hip or worse. After gathering myself and clearly no one caring to check on me I left limping to my car nothing was broken but still disappointed. I will be reaching out to corporate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2

Sara H.,"Snellville, GA",42,30,1,1.0,3/25/2017,"Against my better judgement we ordered from here.  * An Old Timer with Cheese ordered well done with no tomato, came blood raw with tomato. No onions, no extra pickle. * A bacon burger came similarly undercooked, with tomato and pickles. No onions. * The one piece of a quesadilla was hidden under pounds of lettuce and included ingredients not advertised. ^ The cheese dip was stone cold and all over the bag. * My ear of corn, nowhere to be seen. An anomaly in otherwise great service? Nope. It's always a complete and total disaster. I called about it.

We sat down anyway because there was no other booth available. Waitress was very pleasant and took my kids order first so they could eat before our food came.

Took her 10 mins to bring me water . Yeah. I wasn't upset, I know the drill. I got Cajun shrimp pasta. It was alright. Sauce was thicker than what I'm used to. And my friend has been telling me to try the Oreo sundae there. I did. I told them to hold the ice cream cuz I was cold enough. When they brought it, the middle had a marshmallow like middle. I tried one bite & could determine the cake was MICROWAVED....BADLY! It was so dry that I couldn't enjoy it. When I told my server she said yeah that's why people get the ice cream.

Alma K.,"Lawrenceville, GA",1,13,1,3.0,1/26/2017,"When we go to this Chili's location we never know what to expect. It's as though some days they're amazing, and then other days we promise never to go back again. The most recent time we went was for my birthday and we had a table of 10 people with us. Our server messed up half of our drinks, served two plates of food, made us wait 10 minutes for the other 4 plates to come out, and another 10 minutes for the remainder of the food to come out. By the time one part of our group was done eating (we told them to eat so it wouldn't get cold), we would just be getting served our food. Some of the food came out burnt, while other food came out pink (my mother in laws chicken for example). We were really disappointed although the server apologized numerous times, it wasn't the service we were having issues with. The food was the thing that has always been the breaking point whenever we went back. Whenever I would order the sliders I would ask for NO BACON, when the food arrives...there's bacon on the burgers (religious reasons as to why I can't eat bacon otherwise it wouldn't be an issue). If my husband would order wings they would come out and they wouldn't be cooked well, or there was a hair on them once, or they were still cold. I hope they do change and start to improve, they have a great menu and great staff, the food just needs to be better prepared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2?start=20

Stephen S.,"Snellville, GA",64,29,3,5.0,7/25/2015,"Out of all the local Chili's restaurants, this is the best in terms of food and service. Occasionally they'll have an off night, but it's fairly rare. This is also one of the better casual-food restaurants in the Snellville area.  Burgers are typically hot and fresh. The fries are really good (if they're not hot, I ask for fresh ones and they don't give me a hard time). The new pickles they introduced a few months ago, along with several new BBQ sauces, make for a great burger. I always ask for the sweet and spicy burger, no tomato, add jalapeño, extra BBQ sauce, and I've never been disappointed. (Tip: Eat the burger upside down and it will hold together better. Also ask for extra napkins!) My wife typically gets the Triple Dippers combo and always enjoys it (usually the little burgers and Southwestern Egg Rolls). She always gets two meals out of it.  Oldest kid gets the chipotle-style chicken fingers, which have an amazing sauce and taste great when they're fresh. They reheat pretty well too.  Youngest kid typically gets grilled chicken on the kids meal. They have some really healthy options for the kids.  Great service, great food--this location can't be beat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2?start=20

Paul C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,16,1,4.0,7/21/2014,"Let me say this, if I was giving this review a year ago it would be two stars.  But after taking a year off, we decided to go back and see if things have changed, and I am happy to say, they have. We have been there four times in the past two months so here goes: Service: I have yet to get a waiter/waitress that we haven't liked. Not pushy but always considerate.  Drinks: LOVE the variety of their marguerites, and they are great too.  Food: mixed reviews depending on what you order. I LOVE their hamburgers with yummy fries and their classic nachos with steak or chicken or both. You can't go wrong with either entree any time any day. Now, where you might not get maximum pleasure is their sirloin steak.  I never order steak here but my wife has and complains either about the flavor or the toughness.  Honestly, for under $12 you get a 6 ounce sirloin plus steamed broccoli and loaded mash potatoes. Maybe in this instance the old adage is correct- you get what you paid for. Or maybe the next steak might be better. (Shrugs shoulders). Sorry I can't review their famous ribs- I don't eat porky pig.  Management: Fantastic! My 90 year-old mother in-law ordered a hamburger medium- rare, but got it medium- well. She did not want to take it back because she didn't want to wait, so she ate it rather grudgingly.  But when I mentioned this to the manager, he gave her a coupon for one free meal. Nice touch. (Who orders hamburgers rare anyhow?)  Oh, did I mention how easy it is now to order and pay your bill?  Love it.  So, when you are done and in a hurry to leave, no waiter, no problem. It's right there on your table.  Shalom, Paul",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2?start=20
