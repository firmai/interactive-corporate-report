Food   Appetizer - none order.   Main Course - I went with something new, outside my box for BJ's.  I had the fish tacos, breaded as that is how I had fish tacos the very first time.  These were not the fisherman on the box fish sticks.  Each piece was unique in size and shape, the two tacos each had to two bread Mahi tuna chunks in them.  The tuna was topped with a zesty slaw.  The plate had some so so colored tortilla chips.  They gave you two square cups, one salsa which was pretty mild and the other was a very thinned out guacamole.  Both were very bland.  A spoon to serve to apply to the tacos would be nice, but I guess I could have just picked them up and poured them where I want it.   Dessert - My daughter had the Pizookie, I did not have any has she was fitting off a cold.  But it was less than 2 bucks on the kids menu and it makes her really happy getting it. Service - We were greeted before we were all they in the door.  She asked if we wanted a kids menu, I said yes.  We were seated immediately, but without the kids menu.  I asked for a kids menu after realizing he did not bring one.  The nonverbal queue was it was such a trauma.  I hate to see if we sat in the back of the restaurant, but we were the closest to the hostess stand.  I was waitress was good.  My office gave us mystery gift cards, you do not know how much is on them until you bring them in.  I brought in two use, figure I would only use the bigger one but the waitress used both, excellent!

We went with some friends on Saturday night and had to wait forever for our food and then they brought us out the wrong pizza and then asked us if it would be ok if we just ate the pizza anyways. We would have because we were starving by then but we had ordered a simple pepperoni and mushroom and they made a pizza that was smothered in onions and balsamic sauce, not our cup of tea so we declined. My daughters Mac and cheese was so over cooked and dry it was all stuck together in big clumps.

I could understand if it was busy, but the place was empty and we could see eight other staff members sitting on benches, standing behind counters...not helping customers...just openly chatting amongst themselves. Our waitress was very slow to bring our drinks and two of the six hot appetizers at our table were cold upon arrival at our table. When we received the bill, out waitress had ""upsold"" our drinks to top shelf liquor without telling us and drinks were outrageously expensive.

242,Matthew H.,"Sparks, NV",9,7,6.0,1.0,2012-09-26,"I had to take a few days to cool off before writing this review. Let be begin by saying that I overall I love BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. I have eaten at BJ's all over the west coast and I normally leave very happy after drinking good beer, eating good food, and receiving excellent customer service. The review that I am writing today is in no way is reflective of BJ's as a whole; this review is only for its location in Sparks Nevada. On Saturday September 22, 2012 I decided to meet family for dinner. We chose to go to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse at the Legends in Sparks Nevada. We arrived shortly before 4pm and sat down at a dirty table in the bar area. It took several minutes for a waitress to notice us and come to collect the check and dirty glasses from the previous patrons. At 4:04pm we ordered an appetizer, nachos and beer, we asked our waitress ""Dee"" about happy hour. She replied that ""we don't have happy hour on Saturday."" I pointed to the sign on the table that stated happy hour during all college and professional football games and motioned to the two games that were currently displayed on the huge TV above the bar. Our waitress replied with ""I have no idea what's going on"" and left to put our order in. At 4:07pm I could see our beers had been poured by the bartender and were sitting on the bar waiting for our waitress to come run them. There we sat until 4:21pm when our waitress brought water out to our table told us that is was in fact happy hour and asked if we were ready to order, we asked about the beer we ordered that we could see sitting on the counter getting flat for the last 14 minutes and our appetizer. She replied ""I can't run them right now; I was hoping someone else would have."" She walked around for a minute and then went to get our beer. At 4:24pm our beer was finally delivered to the table and she took our order for dinner. Someone from the kitchen came out with our nachos at 4:27pm, there was not silverware on the table and we were hungry so we just went and got them ourselves to avoid any further problems. At 4:30pm our waitress came to check on us, I ordered a second beer. I could see my beer get poured and was sitting on the bar at 4:33pm once again it just sat there until another server decided to bring it to the table at 4:46pm. The food finally arrived at 4:51pm, the food was good however my sandwich was served with far fewer fries than are normally served with meals and the plates were lacking the normal presentation I have come to expect from BJ's. It took over 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get a beer, at a Brewhouse I find highly unacceptable. The restaurant and bar had a typical Saturday crowd, it was by no means busy, and the restaurant looked adequately staffed. I would have voiced my complaints to a manager but there was no manager in sight most of the time we were there. As a frequent BJ's customer I have become accustomed to having a manager come by at least once during the meal to check on me. This did not occur, the only time I saw a manager during our visit was when two people who appeared to be managers came out from the back to stand behind the registers chatting with employees and divvying out tips in with the other staff in front of customers (See attached photos). I find 5 people standing behind a register while my beer is sitting on the bar getting warm and flat appalling. I would not write a review after one bad experience but a situation similar to this occurred about a month before when I had lunch at this location. I feel this location is lacking sound management and the restaurant as a whole is suffering. Poor employee education, training and the lack of management support and oversight lead to poor customer service and upset customers as a result. Luckily for BJ's I have had the pleasure of eating at other locations where I have become accustomed to enjoying great beer food and customer service at other locations. After two bad experiences in a row I will not be returning to the location in Sparks Nevada.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=240,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.5320000000000005,3.5600000000000005
257,S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,3.0,2012-10-09,"Chain restaurant. Dinner with a couple of doctors. Apparently, the favorite for the local medical group for entertaining guests because of the GIANT SELECTION. Honestly, this menu was twice as large as any other BJ's I've been to. Setting: Situated in the Sparks shopping mall, this restaurant is ideally located for the hungry shopper. There is bountiful parking with multiple entrances and exits. The general feel of the restaurant is similar to that of other BJ breweries. The main difference is the abundance of televisions plastered along every wall. The only drawback is that every single one was showing the same game. What if you didn't like football? Stinks for you cause that's what you're watching. Tables are appropriately spaced such that traffic is never impeded, even at full capacity. We went on a Monday night, very low traffic. Waiter: Energetic and friendly with a generally happy disposition. I'm not sure all waiters do this but he was very systematic regarding taking orders. A refreshing change from the several occasions where I've had to repeat my order several times. He was quick with our refills. Given that we had a relatively large party, I appreciated the fact that he updated us with the status on our food several times. Definitely one of the pluses of this particular outing. Food: Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. As always, cooked to perfection. The crust was slightly buttered and crispy, the perfect combination for pizza. The deep dish pizza was indeed, thick, possibly measuring about 1 inch in depth. BBQ roasted to the point where it was slightly spicy. They may have skimped on the tomatoes a little bit. Lucky for me, they compensated with chicken. PROTEIN!!! Didn't get the desert but the pizooky is highly recommended. Drinks: Diet coke. 3 refills in 1 hour. Not sure if I got my money's worth. Recommendation: EAT!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=240,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.8280000000000003,3.5200000000000005

305,Jessica P.,"Reno, NV",5,50,7.0,1.0,2012-10-29,"I visited BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse on a Sunday evening for dinner. I have mixed feelings about my visit there so I will write this blog and let you be the judge.   The décor in BJ's is a mix of American Pub décor and modern styles. The atmosphere is really nice and the light fixtures are very modern. The restaurant is full of red upholstered booth seats with a few pub style tables in the bar area. When I walked into the restaurant I was greeted very promptly by the hostess and I was seated right away. I was given water right away and the waitress (whose name was Lindsey and you will understand why I'm naming names this time as you read on) came by to get our drink orders. It didn't take me long to make up my mind because I have had the pizza at the location in Reno before and knew it to be some of the best pizza in town. The waitress took quite a while to get back to our table but it was REALLY busy so I expected that my dinner might take a bit. When she came back with our drinks I placed my order. I ordered the chicken wontons appetizer served Thai style for $2.95, a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette for $2.95, and a medium Spicy Meatball deep dish pizza that I requested no onions on and I wanted bacon added; the pizza was $22.75 (Sorry there is no pizza pic... got a little distracted due to the events that unfolded).   The salad arrived within minutes and was delivered to us by another waitress; it was amazing how fast the salad came out! The pizza on the other hand took forever and we also never received our appetizers; I told Lindsey when she delivered the pizza. She wasn't very friendly or apologetic about forgetting the appetizers, in fact she acted like we were an annoyance to her so I told her to just forget the appetizers. I also asked the waitress for some ranch to go with the pizza and we each wanted a new drink (we had empty glasses for quite awhile now). It only took us each a bite to realize that our pizza was wrong and when we finally were able to waive the waitress down and tell her so she literally made a disgusted gasping noise and started walking away; as she walked away she said that she would have the manager over and before she had her back turned to us I literally saw her roll her eyes at us and shake her head.... now the experience had made a turn for the worse and I was fuming; I have never been treated so horribly by a server in my entire life! (And she still hadn't brought me the ranch I requested). The manager whose name was Eric came over to find out what was going on with our order. Eric was very courteous and explained that he would have our appetizers out and our pizza remade. He also expressed that he wanted to make things right and asked up what he could do for the inconvenience. I suggested maybe comping a drink or two and he said his manager didn't like him to comp alcohol so he would come up with something else. The waitress came by a few minutes after the manager left and asked us what had happened and we told her he was remaking our pizza so she took the pizza we had in front of us away (still no ranch). Our appetizers were delivered to us by another waitress again and it was a good thing they came because I was starving... I think at this point we had been there an hour or a little over that.   The pizza still took another 20 minutes to get to us and this time it was done right. I still had not received the ranch I requested and after trying to get the waitresses attention when she passed us by two times (she was most definitely ignoring us on purpose at this point) I almost had to shout to get her to come over to our table at which point I asked her for the ranch again. She came back with the ranch about 5 minutes later. The manager came back over to our table towards the end of our meal and told us he had comped the pizza and asked if there was anything else he could do... I told him no and that he was really excellent and that I appreciated his efforts. I didn't say one word to him about how rude and atrocious our waitress was and how bad she was at being a server. I literally considered giving her no tip which I have NEVER done in my life. Even thought her service was the worst I have ever received I still gave her an $8.00 tip which is far more than she deserved.   I can honestly say that I will probably never go back to BJ's in Sparks which is too bad because they have great food and a great manager. But, if BJ's is hiring this kind of low caliber server I can't say I want to visit them again; I don't go out to eat and spend my hard earned money so I can get treated like shit by a server.. excuse my french.   It's really too bad that horror stories like this happen; do you have a restaurant horror story, because I'd love to hear it... tell me where I don't want to go eat this time!

Then as we waited and waited for our pizzas, waiter stopped by. Said that he made an error and admitted to forgetting to place our food order. No problem to me. Very professional. Admitted error. That would be enough to satisfy me.  Said that the manager was coming over to talk to us. Manager delivered dinner about 10+ minutes later and gave us a different story. Said that they made one of the pizzas wrong and had to redo, hence the time delay. Well, I believe the waiter, but it doesn't matter. They did comp us the appetizer and 1/2 of each pizza, but it would have been okay without doing that. I didn't ask for that, but they offered. Took them up on it. That will keep me from holding a lifelong grudge. We did wait over 30 minutes after our appetizer was done for dinner.  Other minor things wrong, but when there's enough of them, they start to add up. Forgot one of the table settings, so missing a napkin for a while after appetizer arrived. One pizza was clearly not cooked enough. Cheese wasn't melted fully. Coffee with no cream. Got the cream, realized that the coffee was cold. Waiter was focused more on table of young ladies next to us which I think contributed to the issues. Desserts were incorrectly delivered to the table of young ladies next to us.

They combined tabs somehow and forgot (twice!) to put in an appetizer order. We were told our table was ready without getting our appetizer, but our waitress assured us she would bring it to our table. After asking twice about it 15 minutes later she finally brought it to us - cold. The service at our table was appalling. I sincerely hope it was our waitresses first night, because she gave terrible service. For a group of 6 I think she refilled our waters once, then forgot about us. I literally had to go to the hostess station to ask for our check after we'd been sitting at our table finished eating for nearly half an hour. The host asked if I wanted to talk to a manager, because we were all pretty irritated, but I felt bad for the waitress and suggested maybe they just cut back on the number of tables she had, since she clearly couldn't handle the burden.

I and several friends have been her more than a couple of times and today, I met some business associates who came into town for lunch. The place was not at all full. Our drinks and appetizer was the only thing that was ok. Everything there after went downhill. We had been there 45 min or longer and realized our food hadn't arrived and then 5 min later another waiter brought out our entrees. What happened to our soups and salads that should have came before our meal. The server looked puzzled when we asked about it. He left what he brought and said he would check on it. Our server who initially acknowledged us when we first sat down said he would bring them out. Well, the soup came and it was COLD. (clam chowder) not so good cold.  He also brought me the last one to get served my chicken pasta, that to was COLD. I was so disappointed. He brought it back, then a male manager came and apologized and said he would bring it out. I also asked how come there was no crackers, which by the way, normally comes with the clam chowder (at least at other BJ's locations I've been to), he said it should have been there. When the server heard me tell the mngr that, after the mngr left, the server said a customer needs to request it. When the entree came out from the chef who delivered it. Guess what, the pasta was COLD as well. The server came around and asked how everything was and I told him that my food is COLD again. He apologized and here comes another mngr named Tina who apologized, etc. In speaking with her my business partners also spoke up and said this wasn't the first, nor the second time there's been problems at their restaurant. Once, there was nobody in the place and was told they needed to be wait (in the lobby area) to be seated, since there was no servers, yet to have arrived at work. WOW! Anyways, me and my associates let the mngr know, we will no longer come again. After more than 3 visits, all under-par, food, service, etc. We will no longer go to that location. I wonder if that's why the place wasn't hardly occupied because of the inconsistency of how its ran.  I've been numerous times (can't even count) to the BJ's in south Reno, where there were lines out the door each and everytime, but the service, and food were good and consistent.

273,The B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,1.0,2014-01-01,"Well, we had to try the corporate Brewhouse to see what was cookin.  We were not surprised.  The pompous little character at the front door who was supposed greet us, needed a slap to his quaffed hair-do. Why would you put a guy like him, so arrogant at the front door is beyond me!  Most of the staff seemed like they were uncomfortable and unhappy... made us feel the same. The appetizer, Santa Fe spring rolls were tasty, probably is where we should have stopped.   Caesar salad was at best average. Nothing going on here. Brewhouse ""handcrafted"" bacon cheese burger was not inventive, just a corporate basic lackluster burger with almost average frozen fries.  Someone else brings our food to the table and auctions it off, I guess like a brewhouse does.  He doesn't see the table and our needs.  We had to ask the server for condiments, catsup and mustard.  What does handcrafted mean to these guys?  They use their hands to put an almost average burger together?  That's the best they can do.   In and Out does a better job, with a better personal experience for a third the cost and better taste.  Have you ever had a bad experience there?  Probably not.  Never in 40 years have I had an attitude or poor service in that place.

Being both a vegetarian and a beer enthusiast, I had more than enough options. The menu is huge! We started off with some fried artichoke hearts. I don't even really like artichokes all that much, and these were delicious and came with a super-tasty (possibly lemon aioli) dipping sauce.  It took us a while to decide on beer because there was just such an abundance of options. It was tempting not to go for one of BJ's beer samplers, but the bottled selection of various Belgian beers was just too good to pass up. I ended up trying a saison from Dupont which turned out to be my favorite saison of all time. No, I'm not exaggerating. I'd go back just for that beer. I tried to order another, but they were all out, so I got a Green Flash Triple IPA. This beer is super hoppy yet surprisingly well-balanced and flavorful for its style. It's also around 10%, so you know...it's well worth the $7.95.  If you're on a budget, you really can't go wrong with the lunch specials which are all in the $6-10 range. I got a margarita flatbread with a house salad for $6.95, and it was more than enough food. I was also considering the soup and half sandwich, the small portion of pasta, or the unlimited soup and salad, all under $10.

You get to choose a soup or salad to start, a medium pizza and a pizookie to share!    I started out with the Chicken Tortilla soup which I love. The flavors of the tortilla strips, huge slices of avocado, cheeses, chicken, and a slice of lime all blend so well together. I just wish that tonight the soup had a little more chicken then what it came with tonight. However, still very yummy. The deep dish pizzas we had were outstanding as always. My two favorite are the Mediterranean and the Buffalo Chicken! BJ's never fails to stuff so many flavorful toppings on their pizzas! The Mediterranean was so fresh tasted so incredible with the grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. Oh my goodness so good! The Buffalo Chicken had diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in a spicy buffalo sauce drizzled with ranch dressing and buffalo sauce. I normally have a difficult time with buffalo sauce as it is normally too spicy for me to eat much of it. I think this pizza has just enough spice that I can feel it on my lips and in my mouth but not enough that would cause me to be a fire breathing dragon!!! It is a perfect combination with the toppings and the sauces. You may all be thinking why so much food?  Well... because they are even better the next morning/afternoon cold or hot! LEFT OVERS! We finished with the pizookie for dessert. I was very sad as they did not have my favorite pizookie, red velvet. They are changing their menu and are not continuing with the red velvet. SO disappointing because that is one of my favorites. My other favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut which never ever disappoints. Perfectly baked so that it still is soft in the middle but crunchy on top. The vanilla bean ice cream is the next piece that completes the dessert. So good. Since we had to order two for the meal deal we also got the chocolate chip, which is good, but for me I would have rather of had the red velvet.

I am so sad to have to leave this review as I have prided myself in only praising incredible acts of service.. But..Here it goes.. We have tried this location for date nights before and were not impressed due to like warm or overly salty food.. But as a fan we decided to try it a fourth time..

My 25 month old and I arrived at 5:20 to which I was told ""we are preparing your table, as soon as 8 of your party members Arrive we will seat you."" The rest of our party arrived at 5:30-5:35. Our party host went to check us in and they said they would seat us shortly. By 6:00 we check in and are told it would be roughly 20 minutes...which would mean an hour after our reservation. At this point all of our toddlers had run laps outside of their facility several times, and were an hour past their meal times. We decided to call a near by restaurant and they were able to get us in right away. Right when we handed in our pager around 6:10 we were told ""half of our table is ready if you'd like to sit down"".Which needless to say made us feel incredibly under valued. This was our first time ever leaving a Bjs, and as a result we spent over 400 dollars at a neighboring restaurant. Half of our party lives in sparks which caused us give this location a try, unfortunately/or fortunately our weekly gatherings will have to be held back at the south reno location. Bottom line: There is a near by Bjs that prides themselves with impeccable customer service 20 minutes away. They often offer samples to those waiting, etc.. Look up ""Reno Bjs"".

When our server finally had a chance to return to our table, we had gone ahead and started eating.  It was bordering on cold but still good. We mentioned the temperature of the entrees as well as the special requests.  He apologized profusely and insisted on a visit from the manager.  Before the manager visited our table, our server had brought a hot plate of fries for my daughter. The manager joined for us for quite a few minutes at our table as we talked about all our other great experiences with BJ's.  We love the food here and even when it arrived a little chilly, the manager and server both redeemed themselves and made it a great night for us.

I was so fearful of sending it back but every single shrimp was undercooked. I received my ""re-fire"" less than ten minutes later to the same result. It wasn't just one again, so I know there must be an inexperienced chef in the kitchen. The Manager came out and advised that they have procedures to cook any type of seafood a particular amount of time and temp but there was something off. They didn't charge me the 19.95 and we ordered an appetizer and dessert of which neither was comped.

We were surprised that it was crowded for a Monday lunch, there was about a 10 minute wait to be seated. When we actually got seated though, service was incredibly slow! Waited another 10 minutes before our server greeted us and took our drink order. We decided to order our whole meal, including the Pazookie dessert judging from how long the service was taking.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with a Cesar Salad and boyfriend ordered The Brewhouse Burger. Food was delicious, but we there was a 25 minute wait for our food. They even forgot my to bring out my salad first, so I had to ask for it when the entree came out.  Pita Tacos were great! The pita bread went extremely well with the mixed Greek tastes inside, which was chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes and it came with a side of quinoa mixed with corn and other deliciousness. My boyfriend's burger came out perfectly medium rare with the bun just utterly so crisp and them shoestring fries, mmm.  After our meal, there was another 20 minute wait for the Pazookie. If you've never had a Pazookie in your life, I recommend trying it before you die. A freshly baked warm cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla that melts right in our mouth! We got ours half chocolate chip and half white chocolate macadamia nut.  Our server also forgot to refill our drinks a few times, we had to ask her twice.

230,Ron D.,"Sparks, NV",39,21,23.0,3.0,2014-12-08,"Okay, I do like BJ's Brewhouse and the quality of their food, the only real problems I've ever had was slow service whilst sitting in a booth, in the bar area never an issue. My other problem(s) is, now correct me if I am wrong here, but when you think happy hour you think select appetizers at a reasonable discount, right? The thing that bothers me most is their so called ""Happy Hour prices"", they are completely deceptive as it's not any cheaper because they make their Happy Hour appetizers half the size(not in their menu anywhere does it say half the normal order) of what they would normally be, hence your still paying full price, see for yourself the next time you are there. Chicken wings for example; you get ten wings off happy hour and five (which in itself is slightly insulting) during their so called ""Happy Hour"", Pot Stickers aren't quite half the order but still slightly insulting when you see the quantity (4), and lastly, their craft beers are a dollar off putting them at four dollars each, not that great of a ""Happy Hour"" price either in my opinion. I'm not looking to get anything for free and as I said their food is good, but when you order five wings for five dollars, four pot stickers for five dollars, two beers at four dollars each, and my wife had some fancy drink that was $9.75 (Strawberry Splash I believe it was) granted it tasted good, but come on! $10 for a drink is a bit expensive/out of line! Our bill came to $28 and change for everything not including the tip, that didn't feel like Happy Hour at all to me, or my wallet. So if you're looking for ""Happy Hour"" prices at BJ's Brewhouse, you'll have to look elsewhere because you won't find it there. Again, the food is good, but 5 wings, 4 pot stickers, and 3 drinks for $28 (tip not included) is really hard to swallow. I would only give them 2 1/2 stars if possible and only completely because of their pricing, look, wings and pot stickers are/is some of the cheapest bar foods you can buy, and honestly, the don't differ very much from place to place. You can argue you get what you pay for, but like I said, ""wings and pot stickers"" folks, ""wings and pot stickers"". $18 dollars for three drinks during happy hour!

216,Virginia M.,"Reno, NV",193,146,18.0,2.0,2014-12-20,"Salads are already kinda disappointing. Even the good ones are basically lawn trimmings slathered in lard-sauce and salt. So a bad salad is like gas station coffee.  -That's also cold.  -That also has chunks of the grind floatin' around in there.  -That's also had a throat lozenge dissolve in the carafe.  So yeah, my salad was like that.  And it wasn't so much that the Cobb salad I ordered came with soggy ham. It's not so much that I care to think about how ham becomes soggy (not moist, mind you. Soggy. Picture Wonderbread in a puddle).  It's not even the fact that the tomatoes may as well have been red-colored tasteless jello bits. Or that they must've ran down to the just-closing Port of Subs for their bottom-of-the-pan lettuce trimmings/emptied shredder tray. Or that on top of all this tasteless wonderment, they drizzled a nice little wisp of still-tasteless dressing; enough to cover the one bite that I should've just stuck with. Or that this entire bowl of ""meh"" was hacked with a weed wacker til it resembled a rice pilaf. No, none of this is what really set me over the edge, my friends. It's the fact that I was already so hungry, and we were already running late for a movie, that I just ate the damn thing.

117,Drew R.,"Reno, NV",152,140,266.0,4.0,2015-01-20,"Four stars you may question and yes I know it's just a chain but hey, they've revamped and they are doing much much better!  I can say a few years ago BJ's, it seemed, had given up and were definitely in a full on downhill coast to monotony. More recently they have made drastic improvements and it is a welcome change.  The beer has always been very good so if you are into the microbrews, enjoy; now you can also return for the food. On this occasion, for my first time, I had one of the deep dish pizzas. Ermergersh! It was really really good. The Mediterranean Pizza had most of what you'd expect: chicken, basil pesto, feta cheese, and obviously a crust. What wasn't so obvious was the sliced pepperoncinis, the kalamata olives, and the roasted garlic. I must admit the garlic had the more subtle note but likely because I've fried my taste buds years ago with garlic: I mean to say I never met a garlic anything I didn't like, and moreover have literally spent days being told how badly I stink because of the garlic [fill in the blank] that I ate somewhere. The nice twist for me was that, as is the norm in pizza, they didn't make a point of leaving a huge crusty edge, but instead monopolized on every inch of real estate available and topped all of it with ingredients. Don't get me wrong the crust was really good and I do like my pizza crusts but it's also about the toppings and this was a delicious blend of ingredients.  I nearly forgot to mention this but even some of the appetizers are fun and a nice tweak. Who doesn't love a Frito boat? Well they've revamped the Frito boat with Frito nachos and it is appealing and yummy on that sophomoric (I'd like the captain crunch, please) level. I could only gripe slightly about consistency, as location seems to play a significant role in how the appetizer turns out; they're still pretty derned good.  In any event I sometimes yelpolaine that this or that restaurant is due for a menu revamp and gratefully BJ's beat me to the bitchosphere completing the process before I asked them to do so. I look forward to their continued progress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=100,3.56,3.35,3.35,3.2800000000000002,3.434

Of late however, my tune is changing. The wait staff is hit and miss.  Sometimes you get a great server and sometimes it is the opposite - spacey and forgetful.  It really depends on the day.   I teetered between 2 and 3 stars before finalizing my thoughts on this review and settled on 2 because ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" really reflects my feelings more than ""A-OK"".  This is due to a few recent experiences with wait staff and, suprisingly enough, the condition of the bathrooms. The first was when we went to BJ's for a sit down meal.  Afterwards we ordered a to-go for my son on a seperate tab.  They waited 48 hours to put my charge through. When I contact the store I received a call from the corporate office - I called them back and havent heard anything since then. Saturday night was the kicker.  We have never gone in for late night but we decided we'd like some real food as opposed to fast food.  We called ahead and sat at the bar.  Mind you - they are open until 1 a.m. I believe and we got in at 9:15 p.m.  It took the 2 bartenders quite some time to ask us if we would like anything.  We both ordered a beer.  I went to the restroom and it was a disaster area and out of toilet paper (see pics).  Once seated back at the bar I looked down and noticed a dirty knife on the floor (see pic). After while I decided I wanted another beer but the waiters were ignoring us.  They had already put our bill in a random shot glass in front of us assuming that's all we wanted.  I asked for another beer and the male server got really annoyed with me, got my beer, ripped away the old receipt and tossed the new one in the glass and walked away.  Wow....just wow.  We got our to-go order and left. Will I go back?  Of course I will.  It's the only sit down place of it's kind in a 15 mile radius of my house.  Will I enjoy the food?  I hope so.  Will I be excited?  No.  Will I ever go back for late night?  No way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=200,3.84,3.36,3.36,2.6960000000000006,3.552

113,Susan A.,"Reno, NV",55,131,275.0,3.0,2015-05-19,"The reason why I gave BJ's a three star is because I had a very bad experience about four years ago with them. This time I decided to give them a second chance. The pulled pork sandwich was very good. It had been onion strings on top of the sandwich. It came with a side of barbecue sauce to pour on top of your pulled pork sandwich. I wanted to eat the whole thing but I was trying to save some room for dessert.  The dessert was phenomenal. It was like baked cookies with ice cream on top. We were able to choose our own flavor. I highly recommend getting the Pizookie.  As for the children's food, my son ordered mac & cheese. It wasn't that great; of course, it's stated it was from the kraft mac & cheese box. When trying it it tasted like it's been sitting for a while and has been warmed up. He did receive :-) potatoes to go with his meal. They were not like a usual potato (wedge).  As for the service, our waiter was very nice and respectful. Waiting on the food did take a little bit longer than a normal wait. But I do have to put in the consideration that they just build about 10+ tables at the same time they seated us.

The waitress was a bit forgetful at times but I didn't think it made my experience worse. The atmosphere was great and it could be good for causal or a first date type of place.  Personally, I really only wanted calamari and wings, which are both appetizers. They were both average in taste, with the calamari being a bit too crispy, but good for ""bar food."" My friend had a brewhouse burger and it was very good according to him.  Lastly, we saved room for dessert with the Pizookie Trio which was fantastic. I love the concept and the taste solidified that love. Neither of us are intense sweet lovers so the trio was a bit overwhelming but I loved the crunchiness and the moist middle.

With such a busy restaurant, they always check up on the table, offer refills, and sometimes the kitchen will get backed-up, but the food comes out piping hot.

There is always someone binging something to your table and asking if that's what you order. It's just crazy!!  The quality of the food went down but know is going up again. When I go there I normally get clam chowder, one time they served it cold and it totally ruined it. I love their burgers and their french fries. I also like their fried chicken and mashed potatoes. The deep dish lasagna wasn't very good last time I had it. It was cold in the middle and had a weird taste.  The last time I had ribs... I think those were the meatless ribs I've ever had.

151,Sarah S.,"Reno, NV",368,434,674.0,4.0,2016-01-23,"After catching a movie at IMAX, we were starving and decided on BJs since it's so close by. I've been to other BJs locations, but never this one. Honestly, I'm usually not a fan of chains like this, but I've never had a bad experience at any location I've been to and I've never had a bad meal. It's not my first choice, but in situations like this, I don't have any problem eating there. One thing I didn't know that they did was offer guest brews on their taps. So, there happened to be a beer brewed by Great Basin on tap, in addition to some California brewers, along with BJs beers. I thought that was pretty cool.  On this most recent visit, I decided to stay a little healthy and not order a gigantic hamburger. The Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos called my name, and even the side of grain salad sounded great too. Of course we ruined any health benefits of that by ordering the southwest egg rolls (seriously, I love these things and I love the chipotle dip that comes with them - such a guilty pleasure). The tacos were nicely stuffed, they didn't really skimp on anything and there was plenty of sauce to add to both of them. I loved all of the flavors and would definitely get it again. The disappointing part was the side salad. Kind of lacking in flavor and majorly lacking in portion. I think they gave me *maybe* a ¼ cup. I could see the bottom of the dish, like it was kind of just smeared around to appear like I had more? I don't know. I made up for lack of grain salad by stealing the addicting shoe string fries off my boyfriend's plate. Service was quick and were didn't feel rushed out of there. We sat and enjoyed a second beer after our meal without feeling like we were taking up precious table realestate. I know we'll back in the future, not necessarily this location, but I know we'll find generally the same food, service, and beer in all of the locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=140,3.72,3.49,3.49,2.8960000000000004,3.5820000000000003

I have a really bad habit of going to restaurants and ordering the same thing every single time but when it comes to BJ's, the entire menu looks delicious so it's one of the only places I venture out of my comfort zone and I'm never disappointed.  My parents and I go here every time they're in town, we always pick BJ's to have dinner. We typically start out with the calamari or the avocado egg rolls. (My mom does their rewards program and we got our appetizer for free on our last visit!!) My parents normally go for steak or fish and I normally try something different every other visit. Especially now that they expanded their menu! After going multiple times my top pick for the appetizer is the avocado egg rolls hands down. The dipping sauce they provide is amazing and its a good portion to share between the three of us. My top three choices for entrees is the California Club Flatbread Pizza, Seared Ahi Salad and the Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl.   Lastly, one of the best parts about going to Bj's...their famous pizookie. A delicious warm cookie topped with ice cream. I believe they have a mini size (free on birthdays), a regular size, or the option to do a pizookie ""pizza"" with a couple different flavors. I'm almost positive I've tried all the flavors over the years and once again, never disappointed. The triple chocolate is amazing as well as the red velvet and the pumpkin flavor (might be seasonal).    When it comes to the staff, I've always had very polite waiters/waitresses, the employees up front lack professionalism but regardless, I come for the food and with more choices on the menu than ever, I'm excited to continue going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=100,3.68,3.5,3.5,3.0600000000000005,3.5720000000000005

Comes back for our order and when my soup is delivered a bit later I ask for Tabasco .  She leaves the table with everyone at the table confused ... Did she hear me ? There was no response of sure no problem or just a minute .

She tells me well you didn't say anything different . I said well I just figured it was implied the appetizer would come before the meal .  Guess I was wrong on Assuming that .   But the 30 plus times before when I have visited must have been a mistake ?   Yes , I'm still not happy because it only gets worst .  At this point , I leave the table go outside and call for a manger on the phone .   I am on hold for 9 mins .

I've tried over the years several different items since their menu is quite large, but just haven't felt there is something that was so yummy I needed to go to BJ's for it.  Also The family and I also tried some of their brews.  All 3 of us didn't care for the beers and they seemed kind of flat.  If not for the nice server, I would give the food itself 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=180,3.16,3.5,3.5,2.732,3.3640000000000008

Spinach salads, I like, especially with bacon.  Sandwich was up a few minutes later.  It was on toasted sourdough, lots of avocado...very good.  Perfect size salad and half sandwich for lunch.  Service was great, food was good.  I was a fan.  My only complaint...not even really a complaint was that the drink was very pricy.  $8.25 for a cocktail at lunch.  Glass was filled to top with ice, so not really a lot of drink in it.    It wasn't like the huge old school ""Trader Dicks"" cocktails that we were all spoiled with in the 90's and 2000's.  Just a regular cocktail.  I mean it was good, don't get me wrong, but $8.25 a tad bit pricy for this type of place. I expect high prices in some places for drinks, just not here.   Oh well, it was good.  Like I said, not really a complaint.  It was delicious...and I will order one again.   So all in all...I give it a yay and we will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=80,3.04,3.31,3.31,3.216,3.202

That being said, if you are a fan of chain restaurant style food, they have pretty good food. Sometimes they are a bit of a hit or miss and if you go here in the evenings or weekend you should expect a hefty wait. I have easily spent 45 minutes waiting for a table. I personally do not find BJ's to be anything special. They are a pricy chain restaurant with decent food. They used to have a really delicious salmon Thai Salmon, it was around $18 (pricy) but the sauce was pretty delicious. They have since taken that off of the menu and I have not found any of their other salmon dishes to be anywhere near as good... especially with the accompanied price tags. I also find their customer service to be a little off point. I've had a mug of ginger-ale spilled all over my clothes by a waitress and received no compensation even though I was completely dripping in ginger-ale and I also had another waitress argue that my ID was not real and once another waitress confirmed my ID was in fact real, she brought back drinks that were clearly non-alcoholic cocktails.

Though it can be a little pricey they do offer a $10 off of $35 coupon which adds to be about a free appetizer!  Let's not forget the pizookies which should be a review on their own. Holy moly these are worth every calorie. I love the peanut butter one but I think it's seasonal. The monkey bread one is pretty good but let's be honest the cookie is the best part!

Was told when we arrived it would be 15 min asked if I was a reward  costumer and we waited 30 min or more. When seated they put us in a booth I am not a small guy you should never put some one my size in a booth. We order drinks and appetizer and dinner at one time that was a mistake it all came out at the same time. I guess our waitress was not smart enough to spread them out was trying to make things easer on her ordering at one time seeing that it took her 15 min after our drinks were order to get them to us. Dimmer came and my wife said that her hamburger was good she asked how mine was and I told her it was cold not ice cold but not piping hot either. She said that her fries were not hot either. All the time our waitress is standing at the server station she never comes over and ask how our dinner was she must have know how long it had set up there the appetizer was hot and ok the boneless wings I had the jambalaya.

I have had the pleasure of eating at both Reno and Sparks location as well as the one at the Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento. So far I have found nothing on the menu that was anything less than perfect and that consistency (as well as the great customer service) is what keeps me coming back.  Why not 5-stars then? Because the menu keeps changing. It is an entirely different menu then the one I loved when they first opened their doors in Northern Nevada back in 2008 (Summit Sierra location). Some of the greatest items on that menu were cut (like the turkey club, which was perfection on a plate) and every time I go back there are a myriad of new things for their customers to try. While I am intrigued by their continual offer of new noshes, I am sad to see my favorite items leave the menu and never return. This should not keep folks from falling in love with this place though as it is one of my favorite haunts.  I'm not much of a drinker so I cannot speak to their bar's consistency.

Seared Ahi salad - Liked it not loved it.  Made sure we ate the ahi first cuz the rest of the salad was typical like any other.  The presentation was really pretty.  But our salad had to be redone due to a hair mixed into the salad.   So how many of you say ""can't dine at BJ's without having a Pizookie""?  Mmmhmmm... nobody's judging.  I think the same way hahaha!  Look I even ordered it to take out cuz Ness had to go to work.  It was still sweetly yummified and the vanilla bean ice cream scoop didn't melt on the way back. Besides the salad hair mishap, our service during this visit was really good.  I hope the tips people leave for Alex all goes to her.  Dunno how it works there.  Thanks for taking care of our table Alex although we sorta rushed the end of our meal.

97,Erica W.,"Sparks, NV",47,9,3.0,1.0,2016-12-01,"I have a small group of friends that get together regularly for lunch and dinner.  We have tried BJ's twice and both times we were beyond disappointed.  The first time the service was slow despite not being busy at 2:00 on a weekday. The food was OK. The second time we were greeted and seated quickly, but the table was sticky and small for our group.  We asked that we be moved to a larger table or booth if one came available.  We were quickly moved and then forgotten.  It took the better part of 45 minutes to get someone to come take our drink order and bring us menus.  Then after many attempts to get help from various servers we had someone come take our order but we never received drinks.  After another 45 minutes, we still had no food and no drinks. Finally, one person in our group went to the hostess station to talk to a manager.  The manager came to the table and appologised and said he would look into it.  Eventually, the orders came. Many were wrong and they were all cold. My chicken was undercooked, one sandwich order was soggy, and one fish plate came that we didn't even order. Everything that could go wrong did.  When we were finally done we couldn't get anyone to bring us our check.  The manager was very unconcerned with the whole situation.  He offered to comp us for the fish (Which we didn't order anyway) and bring us a dessert of our choice.  We declined. At this point, our meal had taken the better part of 3 hours.

I also ordered the a slab of ribs. They weren't tender and didn't have much sauce. In the past, at other locations they've  been really good.  That's the whole reason we went. I was craving their ribs.  My husband ordered a pizza. Half of it had no sauce or cheese. No idea how that happened. We brought it to our waitress attention. She said ""it's cool, I'll get the manager."" And took the pizza. She had a I dont care attitude and acted like we were a inconvenience.   We waited 15 mins before she came back and told us they were working on another pizza.  I ended up sharing my food with my husband. I couldn't eat in front of him when he had nothing.  The 2nd pizza took a half hr. We told the waitress to have them box it for us. At that point my husband and I were full from my food. The manager FINALLY showed up with the 2nd pizza, apologized, said he felt bad and told us that he will speak with the kitchen staff so when we come back next time we shouldn't have any issues.

The balsamic chicken was my favorite. WAS. Apparently they removed it from the menu. You removed the best gluten free dish you had. The only other options now left are either a rib eye (yeah, you're trying real hard to be gluten free), and a few other dishes that really only people with specific tastes will like, which I didn't have. Having Celiacs, I'm already limited in what I can eat, and now you've removed really the ONE gf dish I did like? I doubt we'll ever be returning to BJ's because of this decision.  Not only that, but the staff really didn't understand what gluten free meant. That is always the most important thing to me, that the staff be properly trained in understanding gluten. It was obvious they did not here. The service was also subpar tonight. While our waitress was friendly, the service and receiving our food was extremely slow (it's a Tuesday night!

And I've never had a meal that I wouldn't describe as, at a minimum, pretty darn good.   I'll just go through a few things I've had in lieu of doing a more general review: 1. Southern fried chicken.  It's awesome.  Crispy & juicy (boneless) chicken breast on top of mashed potatoes with some gravy and succotash.  They have a smaller portion for lunches vs dinner and I got the lunch portion and after eating half of it became extremely angry that I hadn't ordered the dinner portion.  It was damn good. 2. Late night burger.  Had this last week and it's listed as new on their menu and it was awesome.  Open face burger with chili verde and bacon and a fried egg?  Come on.  Chili verde is my jam and what I gauge every mexican restaurant on, and theirs was better than many.   3. Avocado egg rolls.  Super good. 4. Calamari.  Better than most.  I wouldn't say it's exceptional, but it's above average. 5. Spinach and artichoke dip.  Again, very good.   6. Ahi poke.  It's a bunch of good quality fish and nice ripe avocado.  I.e. it is lovely.   7. Clam chowder.  Very well done.  I've had worse at dedicated seafood restaurants. 8. Pizza.  Only had it once and it was the lunch sized (for one) ""gourmet five meat"" pan pizza.  Very good.  Good enough that I want to order one or two of their big pizzas even though they're not a pizza place. I honestly can't think of a single thing I'd fault them on.  Food is good.  Service is good.  Place is nice.  Things arrive quick when you're there for lunch and trying to get in and out.  In terms of ""American"" food, this is the place in Reno.  If anyone doesn't really like it they're probably being a picky assholomio. In terms of American food I guess Hash House would be the other big competitor in Reno.  Hash House to me is really more of a breakfast/lunch place though, whereas BJs isn't (since they're not open for breakfast).  Hash House has some great dinners too (I remember a duck dish that was killer) but in general BJs wins on variety and Hash House wins on quantity.  BJs probably wins on quality too, but I think it's pretty close.  Both have quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=100,3.24,3.28,3.364,3.4440000000000004,3.2640000000000007

Ordered the bison burger, added fresh jalapeno (what came out was pickled) and another ordered the bison burger with some specific requests (no bun, tomato and avocado only) waiter confirmed her order and suggested a lettuce bun, and she agreed nice catch.  Other 2 meals were the chicken tacos, and I believe a western burger.  Some had fries some did salads, and again kudos to the waiter asking if we want salads prior to main or with main.   Service is on point another round of beers is ordered, not a fan of light beers but was in the mood for a lager and the standard lager there pouring here drinks easy.  Meals come everything looks great except the lettuce wrap burger comes with everything on it, which is a bbq sauce and pepper relish, had to address this, waiter said no problem would get an immediate re-fire.  Manager came over apologized and let us know the ETA on the new burger is 3 min out and he would in turn be delivering it.  True to their word 3 min go by and burger comes out perfect. On other visits I've had better food or worse service but the place gets a consistent 4 stars from me, I've done drinks and bar food at the bar, bigger events here, and just normal evenings out and I just appreciate a place with consistency.  Check them out on a Tuesday great wine specials and discounts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=40,3.32,3.31,3.368,3.3120000000000003,3.314

We decided to eat at BJ's near the gym since we would be on limited time. I called in the morning to ask about calling ahead or putting our name in as we had a very short window to eat and get back to the gym for pick up. The staff member who answered at 8:30 am was very pleasant and explained we could call an hour early or download the BJ'S AP to put our name on the list in the early evening.  When I went to hang up he said, ""You know what, it's Valentine's day- I'll take your name now.""  He made my day!!  We showed up at 5:40 (late)  and were seated withing 10 minutes! Our dinner was great! We love the gluten free pizza and the Twisted BLT salad. A glass of wine and we were out of there just in time to pick up my daughter from practice, yet we had a pleasant and un-rushed meal.

Most the time, and the service is usually great, most the time. Last night, the hubby and I decided to stop at BJ's for some late night dinner after our enchanted Beauty and the Beast movie. After scouring the huge menu, I decided on the shrimp and asparagus penne and my hubby ordered a mini pizza. Our server mentioned that large pizzas were half off on Monday, so we went with a large. Mike's rewards card was acting up and so the waitress said a manager was coming to talk to us about it. The food came. The pizza was huge, cheesy and delicious! However, my pasta was VERY Al Dente. Too Al Dente. I know the perfect bite for a pasta, and this wasn't it. BJ's, your Penne Pasta needs to be cooked a tiny bit longer. If it's par boiled and then held, the par boil, does need to be longer.  Either way I ended up ordering the mediterranean tacos, to go.  So why the three stars? Well tonight the waitress was great and did her job perfectly, yet I feel as if the manager on duty failed. He never came to our table to discuss the loyalty card, and never came to apologize about the food mishap either, which we all know a plate sent back warrants a visit from an apologetic manager, ready with solutions to make the customer happy.  Pizookie anyone? I'm not above a bribe! Lol ok so all joking aside, it felt like he didn't care enough to come out of wherever he was, to address any situations. Finally as we were leaving, the manager appeared out of no where, still never approaching us, to say ""Have a goodnight!""  ...Well honestly manager man, it would have been better if you'd made an appearance. Said anything to us at all. You're lucky to have a wait staff whose as good and friendly as they are! Because otherwise I would have been more upset about the whole situation.

They are like not taking credibility for this mistake and I assure you the order was sent in successfully but they are saying we didn't order and this puts me in a position where I am questioning myself and when I question myself it leads me to be stressed over the situation.

Last night a large group of us met for drinks after work.  We brought an out of town visitor, knowing that BJ's has such an extensive menu, and having been pleased in previous visits, we felt like this was a good choice.  The one thing I can say is consistent is the wait.  Every time we come here we have to wait longer than we should (for the food).  Whether I've gone with 2 people, or 10, they are slow.  I have always blamed it on the fact that they are busy, but last night that was not the case.  My first thought as I walked in was about how quiet it seemed in comparison to every other time I have gone.   Drinks at the bar were fine.  I was served right away, the bar tender was of average friendliness.   They were out of many beers, so my companions didn't get their first or 2nd choice, but they found something wet and alcohol flavored, so they were good to go.  After 30 minutes at the bar we moved to a table.  It took about another 30 minutes to get water-after we had ordered appetizers 20 minutes after being seated.  I wasn't super annoyed at that point because the drinks had kicked in, we were enjoying ourselves, so whatevs.  Oh, and they were always around to take drink orders.   When we got the appetizers, they were quickly gone-we ordered brussel sprouts-which are always good and my personal fave.  We also got the avocado egg rolls, calamari, pot stickers, artichokes (fried) and ahi.  Avocado rolls were consistent and good, ahi I only received a small bite but it seemed fine.  Then another 20 minutes or so after the appetizers were gone, they took our dinner orders.  We didn't receive our food until about 7:30, and we had arrived at BJ's at 5.   3 of us ordered the ahi salad.  3 of us did not enjoy it.  Having ordered it several times before, I knew something was wrong.  Since we were with a visitor, it had taken so long to get our food, and at this point, I just wanted to go home, I didn't say anything.  I ate around it.  After completing the meal and our guest had left, I was told that others felt the same.  It just wasn't good.  Our bad for not telling anyone, but at this point, we were all tired. I don't understand why BJ's is always so slow, but I was surprised that the food was bad.  They also served us at different times.  My friends waited at least 10 minutes AFTER me to receive their jambalaya, Alfredo, and Peruvian quinoa and shrimp.  They liked it though, so at least they got full!   We were going to come here for another business lunch today, but have decided to take our business lunch somewhere else.  We can't afford to wait like we did last night, and we can't afford to serve our guest sub par food.  I am sure I will be back again due to the close proximity to my job, but I don't know that I will order the ahi again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks,3.52,3.31,3.344,2.7600000000000007,3.394

No matter what day of the week I go, there always seems to be a short wait if you go between 6-7pm.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip. The chips were thin and seemed like they were made in house. The dip was ok but thankfully the chips were delicious. For dinner I got the cherry chipotle glazed salmon. I have no tolerance for spice but took the risk because I really wanted salmon. If you got this dish hoping it had some kick to it you'd be thoroughly disappointed, but thankfully the lack of spice was good news for me. It was sweet but not overpowering.

My water glass sat empty for I don't know how long. It was finally refilled as we were trying to get our check to leave. We sat there for another 10 or 15 minutes and when I decided it may be faster to go to the hostess stand to try to pay our bill, the server came by, complained about how busy he was, and finally printed the check. The food was better than just ok and my army of pre-teen girls were having a good time, so I guess it wasn't all bad, but the service was so bad, it will probably be a long time before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=20,2.88,3.27,3.32,,3.114
5,Kathie A.,"Carson City, NV",41,2,3.0,5.0,2018-01-07,"BJ's has always been a great go-to restaurant for my family to go to (everyone can find something on the menu). However, this time was exceptionally different. On that day of my graduation from the University of Nevada, Reno (go Wolf Pack!), I was incredibly happy to have family from Las Vegas, NV and Lancaster, CA be part of my special day. We were very thankful to BJ's for allowing us to walk in during this busy time without a reservation, considering we had a party of 14. We were seated at about 6:00 pm and from then on, our experience was beyond what we had expected. We have always had great experiences at BJ's, but this visit was exceptionally different. It exceeded our expectations, mostly due to our incredible waitress, Julie E. She was incredibly friendly, accommodating, attentive, and an overall AMAZING individual. She had patience with everyone as we ordered, asked for additional condiments during the meal, and she frequently checked-in on us - all during a very busy night. The most impressive thing was this: I asked her for a group picture and I have never seen anyone go above and beyond to make this happen. She was a fairly small girl and needed a boost to fit everyone in the frame. A co-worker of hers brought her a small stool and she made it happen! It is such a small gesture, but to customers who are sharing a meal with their loved ones, it means the world. This type of customer service and hospitality is what every restaurant needs. This employee is very special and people like her are what give customers an incredibly positive experience. Thank you, BJ's, for not only serving delicious food but also hiring exceptional employees like Julie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks,2.96,3.27,3.336,,3.146
