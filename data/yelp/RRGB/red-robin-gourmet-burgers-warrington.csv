Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,4.0,12/1/2017,"The service today was so amazing. Our server Steven was very polite and made great menu suggestions so that we could get the unlimited fruit for my son. The host was super polite, and the manager Zach really seemed to care about people having a great experience.  The food - wings were surprisingly yummy - small-ish, but perfectly cooked and juicy, which is all I look for. The sauce good - some Asian and pineapple thing.  The simple burger, sadly, as overcooked. As in, we ordered a medium, and not only was it well done, but it was chewy, dry, baaaadly well done. Mentioned it briefly to Zach, not really expecting anything, but my son wasn't enjoying it, and he offered to first replace it, but my son didn't want any more food (having filled up in fruit already), so he then said he would make an adjustment on our check ($4 off). He says that it's a thank you for the feedback. Not as awesome as a free burger, especially since the one we got was inedible, but good enough.  5 stars for the service, 1 for the burger, and 4 for the wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Jae L.,"Horsham, PA",238,105,66,5.0,11/12/2017,"This isn't my first time at this location but I have to say, this past visit was the best experience all around since it opened in this location. First off, shout out to Alex, the waiter who was just amazing to my party. He checked in very frequently, gave great service, very polite, and just made my experience amazing. I think the service was far above and beyond. Just wanted to say thank you Alex.  The food today was great. I got my usual choice of the Bleu burger and it came out fantastic today. The steak fries were fresh every time it came out to the point where I had to let it sit so that it cooled a bit.  The place was really busy but, I was taken care of like I was the only one there. Drinks, fries, any and all refills and orders came on time and fresh. If service is like this every time and the food pipping hot like this every time, I'll go back more frequently for sure",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Mama O.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",12,191,480,2.0,8/8/2017,"Ugh Over $50 for 1 adult & 2 kids only to leave feeling gross like we had the same quality of slop we would have eaten at McDonalds.  I ordered the RR ""Gourmet"" Cheeseburger. It was super greasy, you could actually see grease puddles on the burger when the roll & rest of the toppings fell apart, which was before I was able to take my first bite. Not what I expected from a restaurant burger. It was served with a very slim handful of fries that were soggy & not good at all.  The spinach / artichoke dip wasn't too bad but not great. Also it was only served with a small amount of nachos (not enough) & some celery -? Interesting. Red onion was chopped on top which was unusual. I didn't mind but luckily the rest of the family wasn't with us because they would NOT want anything served with onions.   The kids menu doesn't offer mac & cheese as a side so we ordered that as my daughters entree & the portion size was only that of a side.  The table & menus were sticky.  In the end ~  No rush to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Vi L.,"Philadelphia, PA",195,208,163,4.0,11/11/2016,"Not bad for a chain. I like the laid back feel of the place, very family oriented. The service was absolutely wonderful. I appreciate that they try to be tech savvy.  Ordered the Royal Red Robin burger, which came with an egg, bacon and a side of garlic herbs fries. Burger was juicy and drenched in a very generous amount of mayo. Also had the boneless wings with teriyaki sauce, very flavorful. It came with a bed of potato chips...I don't get it, but sure. Also got an extra side of sweet potato fries, can't really mess that up. Good food, great atmosphere and attentive service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Ray H.,"Horsham, PA",5,16,,5.0,6/8/2017,"I've had some issues with this establishment in the past that had led to me leaving a poor review in the past. However, I've had a great experience dealing with Assistant General Manager Frank Borelli.  Red Robin has won my favor back.  We visited last Saturday and despite the place being packed our server Alex was absolutely phenomenal. We never had an issue needing anything, he was bright, personable and I would absolutely try to have him as our server in the future. Thank you for a fantastic experience Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Laurah J.,"Hyattsville, MD",1,49,10,5.0,5/2/2017,"For me, the number of stars a place gets is not just about the food, but also about the quality of the service. We're busy, so we don't get to eat out very often, and my hubs and I were both restaurant people for many years- so we know what goes on in the industry, standard expectations and reality alike. We had a bad first experience at our first visit to any RR when we went to one local to us. We had just about decided that we were never going again, but we were in PA visiting friends and this location was by a wal*mart where we stopped to pick up a few things. We were in about 2:30 pm yesterday- way after the lunch rush. In many restaurants, this is a time when service and food can be less than stellar. However, that was not the case at this RR.  Amy F. was our server, and she was fantastic, friendly, and very attentive. We didn't have to ask for a thing. She did a great job of explaining the menu and specials, since it was our first time at RR in a long time, and only our second visit ever.  The food was prompt and fantastically delicious. The manager even stopped by to check in on us. The restaurant was clean (even the bathrooms!!) and the overall experience was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Nicholas S.,"Philadelphia, PA",32,243,123,2.0,8/18/2017,"I loved Red Robin as a kid, but they've down sized on the ""bottomless fries"" and the quality has gone downhill since I was little.  The tower of onion rings and campfire sauce (basically mayo and BBQ but it's really good) are the only item that hasn't gone down in quality.  I had the Southern Charm burger. The patties aren't very thick, and there was something odd/cheap about the lettuce and tomato. My burger fell apart, like the patty was broken in half when I received it.  Service is great. They have these neat little touch screens where you can order food and I think play games. Ours was blinking because it was out of paper, but multiple people came over to ask about the blinking light. Only our waitress actually changed the paper, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Jarrett F.,"Warminster, PA",406,9,,1.0,4/28/2017,Skip this place they always have flat soda and horrible service I'd like to say I'd go back ...I wont.I tried three times .That's enough for anyone to say anyway forever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
D L.,"Doylestown, PA",0,130,,4.0,5/31/2017,"The service deserves 5 stars.The service we had was amazing. The hostess was very friendly and professional. Our server was very attentive and professional. When he saw that my fries were too salty, he offered to replace them and  they were quickly replaced with unsalted fries. I noticed other servers in action. All seemed very patient, professional and attentive to their customers. If there had been poor service in the past, that issue clearly has been addressed, at least when I was there. The food was okay for a chain place. It in no way compares to the local independent pub in the area. The burger had a better quality, pre-prepared, fast-food quality, unlike the fresh-made type of burger I am used to getting.  However, for a chain place, it will do. I give the food 3 stars based on what I ate, which was a burger and fries. Not bad but not exceptional compared to what I have access to at the same price. I am not in a hurry to return.   Both the restaurant and restroom were extremely clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington

Hope L.,"Willow Grove, PA",22,16,3,5.0,8/6/2017,I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is always so welcoming and friendly.

I thought that was very thoughtful of them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Mark B.,"Warrington, PA",6,8,,5.0,1/4/2017,"Huge menu. The scrumptious burgers are accompanied with bottomless steak fries. Our server Bill did a fantastic job taking care of our party of 6 with our numerous requests. Prices are reasonable. Figure $75 to $80, not including the tip.

Sarita H.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,6,1,1.0,1/18/2016,"This place needs a lesson in diversity.  I was traveling alone and since I didn't want to wait was directed to the bar area.  The waiter came over and gave me a funny look when I asked him about a menu item.  He sent BRANDON the manager back who basically told me to move unless I wanted to sit AT the bar.  Since I didn't feel like driving anywhere else, I went back in the line.  I was then seated at a table and it took 5 minutes for anyone to come and ask what I wanted (and even then it wasn't my server).  Justin was the only one who stepped up in this experience and acted intelligently and without the attitude of ""Why are you here?"" I noted that the white family seated after me  got immediate service from my server Bill.  It is a sad thing in 2016 in PA To be treated like Mississippi 1955.  Btw: the seafood scatter platter blows.  I don't know if it was me or if they usually serve seafood, fries and coleslaw in a tiny basket and not expect it to be soggy and unappealing.  Save your money boys and girls.  For $14 I've done better in diners. In conclusion, Justin was the only good part of the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington

Stephanie V.,"Doylestown, PA",186,19,10,5.0,8/3/2016,"I had a very good experience at this Red Robin location. My party of 3 only waited about 15 minutes for a table. The appetizers were brought out quickly and were delicious. I ordered the burnin' love chicken burger with a gluten free bun - I simply ordered the gluten free bun because I like it, not because I actually have an issue with gluten, however, they took it very seriously as if it were an allergy and also did not batter the jalapenos inside the burger. So, even though I don't have the allergy, it was nice to know they take it seriously! And they brought me the battered jalapenos at my request as well. The server as well as the manager were very attentive and I will certainly be back to this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington
Jillian N.,"Shokan, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2016,Got a to go order.  We were very clear that the kids burger should not have cheese due to a dairy allergy.  It was wrung up as a burger.  2 other cheeseburgers were supposed to be med rare.  When we got home the kids burger was a cheeseburger and all other burgers were very very well done.  It actually tasted like everything was burnt to a crisp.  My husband took back my childs cheeseburger because of the allergy before we even checked out everything else.

Mike S.,"Doylestown, PA",23,9,,1.0,12/13/2015,"We've been here a few times and each time it seems to get worse. This is the smallest Red Robin I have ever seen, which isn't good for wait times to sit (but food wait times are quite long) The hosts don't seem particularly friendly, and the servers have gotten bad as well.  The last time we went the server wasn't great, and then when we were ready to pay (aka- use the computer at the table to pay which asks you to rate your visit) she apologized for the bad service saying ""I had too many... There were... We were just busy..."" (They weren't half as busy as I've seen them before and had better service).

Frank P.,"Warrington, PA",0,54,18,4.0,7/12/2016,"So after my first review, and having contact with Red Robin customer service I decided to give it another shot. Went in on a Tuesday night around 5, was greeted within a few minutes and was seated promptly. Food was brought out within 15 minutes and was correct and hot.

Jennifer S.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",1,42,22,3.0,12/30/2015,Orders taken promptly.  Burgers took longer than expected to come out though. Black and Blue burger was good.  A little sloppy to eat.

Samuel C.,"Glenside, PA",1,13,37,4.0,7/18/2015,"We can't complain, we had great service and the burgers were well made. It was interesting being divided into people who were 21 and older, but it felt nice in a way. We ate the $5 Red's Boneless Wings in Teriyaki Sauce, Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double and the BLTA Croissant. All three were delicious and we had no complaints. We also had a free dessert, because we are part of Red Robin Royalty, which you should definitely be a part of. The Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double is definitely a burger for those who can handle some heat and the BLTA Croissant is for those who enjoy something less greasy than a burger. Other than this, the fries were good and so were the sweet potato fries. You really can't argue too much about a Red Robin. It's just a typical Red Robin chain restaurant. There is a lot of parking available and lunch time is a nice peaceful time to go. The service was good when we went, but I guess that depends on the server and day.

Jessica Y.,"Hatfield, PA",2,27,11,1.0,7/24/2015,"I'm giving one star because the first time we went was pretty good. We sat at the bar, bartender was nice, the general manager (the Asian lady) was around and spoke with all the guests and the food was pretty good.  But the last experience I had with my friend was absolute shit. I mean enough to ruin it to the point where we will never come back. To any red robin for that matter. I would give negative stars if I could.  For a burger and fries joint, those are THE two things you really can't afford to mess up. Yet they did. Cold burgers. Cold fries. I asked for no salt. Of course it was extra salted. Like COME ON. I emphasized it over and over. and why the hell does it take 30 mins for my ""bottomless"" round of fries to come. We were finished with our burgers before the second round even came. Is that how they try to skimp you out? You'd think they would have fresh fries rolling out the kitchen but apparently waiting for COLD food is part of Red Robin's experience. The icing on the cake?

Vivian L.,"Perkasie, PA",1,27,,2.0,7/26/2016,"As said before...I think this place has an issue with minorities. The waitress who was supposed to be taking care of us, ignored us the entire time while being extremely attentive to the non-minority tables. We asked two different people two different times just to get some napkins. It's a burger joint for god's sake, where do you expect me to wipe my hands? When the waitress finally came over, I reminded her that she forgot about my napkins and she rolled her eyes! This place gets a meh two stars at best. The hostess at the front was friendly and the burgers were mediocre. Ordered a margarita and it was the weakest drink I've ever had.

Timothy D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,6,1.0,7/13/2015,"I was really excited to try red robin in warrington because it's new and all the commercials made it seem so tasty however in reality a glorified McDonalds - and that's being generous. The endless pit of fries came with very little and when asked for more they didn't come out until we were finished our burgers. Silverware and glassware wasn't clean and the slow almost ""annoyed that we were there"" service . Burgers were ok . Plates looked messy and thrown together.

Tina L.,"Warrington, PA",0,6,,1.0,7/29/2017,"We ordered take out a couple of weeks ago and they got the order wrong. One burger was missing the toppings that it was advertised with. We called the place and a rude manager lady takes the call. She apparently couldn't pull up the order. We gave her all the information she asked for and she still couldn't pull it up. After dealing with her attitude and incompetence we gave up. She toon our number down and said she would call us back. Yeah never called us back. Now, we ordered our meal. The person said 13 minutes it will be ready. We pull up 25 minutes later and shocker, it wasn't ready! Why you ask? ""It never went through in the system"". We proceeded to wait about 25 minutes and we walk in and guess what? It's still not done!! The manager completely avoided me and didn't even bother to come over and make sure I wasn't satisfied. And to make matters worse, one the staff members tried insinuating that I was dumb because apparently ""several people call the wrong red robin"". There's no other red robins around here.

Valerie N.,"Warminster, PA",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2017,"Worst service ever.

We had to then ask for water, got the water and that's it. Meanwhile the other table of 4 gets their food. We are still sitting there with just WATER, no appetizers we ordered or even the fries.  Meanwhile Amy walks by us numerous times almost trying not to make eye contact while helping all the tables around us (not that busy on a Monday around 3pm). Brought this up to another worker, had to finally get the manager Frank to help us. While frank helped and was nice the waitress really put us in a horrible mood, the last thing that should happen going into a restaurant. Why would we go back after leaving there feeling the way we did? They didn't even offer anything, like sorry for the poor experience here is 10% off... something!?! No, nothing but the full bill.

It would have got a 5 star if it was not for those annoying terminals - touch the thing to check your order or anything and it seems to charge you a $3 usage fee.  The staff are always fine to take it off but it also kills conversation at the table when kids are playing games that did not require parent authorization to add to the bill,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=20

Neal N.,"Warrington, PA",8,48,13,3.0,5/9/2015,"We went the week that they opened. While the food and service were both food, the restaurant design is not ideal. This location is much smaller than any other Red Robin I've ever visited. The high tops in the bar are crammed together, and you feel like you are going to get bumped on either side by a server or a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Erika W.,"Willow Grove, PA",7,7,,4.0,9/5/2015,Stopped in for dinner last night. We were seated right away. I was pleasantly surprised at the healthy options on the menu. My turkey burger in a lettuce wrap was well seasoned(maybe even a little too peppery for me but I'm picky) and juicy. I also like the variety of better choice sides. I had the cole slaw. It's nice to know I can indulge my family but still stay on track with my own food choices. I took a star away for the pepper!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Nikki B.,"Willow Grove, PA",12,153,5,1.0,12/7/2015,HORRIBLE! uncooked burger! ew!!! also slow slow slow service. i would recommend going to ruby tuesday across the street!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Kerry L.,"Abington, PA",0,19,4,2.0,7/4/2015,"Had to ask for utensils and napkins, bottomless fries took forever to refill, order came out wrong, waitress had to be reminded multiple times of requests for sauces, take out boxes, etc. For just having opened, this location is failing quickly. I'll drive to Neshaminey next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Pattie K.,"Warrington, PA",1,6,,1.0,7/6/2016,"My experience at red robin was awful. We ordered specifically for a monster milkshake. (Unlimited)  for an extra dollar. My son also played two games on the store tablet , which where clearly marked as free. However, we where surprised when we received our check that our waitress Alexa had charged us for an extra milkshake for 4.99 and an extra 1.99 for entertainment. I would NEVER recommend going to this red robin. Our waitress Alexa was misleading and scammed us of our money. When asking for a refill on our milkshake, Alexa told us we should order from the store tablet, later telling us that in order to get an unlimited refill, we would have to ask for a tin. We had no idea why Alexa charged us for extra, when we ordered an unlimited milkshake and she had never mentioned an extra charge. When asking about the extra charge, she said we had ordered two milkshakes, rather than one unlimted milkshake  which was outragous when she knew we had ordered ONE unlimited milkshake. Be aware when ordering at red robines. This will be our first and thankfully last experience at ANY red robins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Samantha E.,"Willow Grove, PA",136,9,,2.0,5/4/2016,"Justin the server is the only reason I am giving this place any stars.  The only time we have ever had good service at this place is when Justin is our server.  The hostess is rude, almost like we are bothering her when we come in.  We always request Justin as our server.  The last time his section was full.  Justin was the only one to come up to say hello.  After 20 minutes of waiting for our waiter we walked out and had fantastic service at Buffalo Wild Wings in the same strip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Lisa S.,"Hatboro, PA",37,1,,3.0,6/27/2015,Had several failed attempts to dine here after several weeks of opening. Can't wait two hours for a burger. Finally went early Afternoon on a Thurs. and was seated right away but service was slow. Burger was good but kind of pricey. Kids enjoyed their burgers also. I think they need to work on servers being more customer oriented and quicker. That would probably reduce wait times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Ryan M.,"Horsham, PA",11,36,12,2.0,9/21/2015,For the price I'd head elsewhere. Burgers were good but the service was slow.  Close to an hour to be served both times we visted without any crowds. Unlimited fries are usless if the waitress never comes around to refill them or the drinks. I'd rather head to 5 guys and get a better burger and better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Jillianne W.,"Hatfield, PA",0,3,,1.0,4/9/2016,"Terrible service. Will not go back here. The sign said they were open till 11, we went in to eat at 9:55 the hostess rolled her eyes and was super annoyed to seat is didn't say anything just slammed our menus on the table and left. All of the servers were cleaning and didn't even look at us we waited for 10 minutes and no one even spoke to us or came to get our order. We left and no one said anything. It's like they ignored us so we would leave and they didn't want to serve us. I know we came a little late but please customer service is always a good thing. And no one in that restaurant has any idea of what customer service is. I hope they didn't have a night manager it didn't look like they did. Being a manger I would never let anyone treat customers like that. You help till the end even 5 min before closing. Everyone counts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Renee H.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,4.0,3/6/2016,"Let's just say, I planned to come in with the family for a quick burger bite. I was told that with a party size of 7 that my wait would be 45 mins. I expressed my displeasure with a wait for that time considering that we were the only people waiting to be seated. This is when the manager Chris went into full managerial mode. He explained that if we split our party we could be seated a lot sooner. We took his advice and were seated right away. Chris then personally introduced us to our waiters and asked for us to receive only 5 star service, which we did. Way to go Red Robin Warrington...excellent service with a top notch manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Rosie C.,"Horsham, PA",0,20,6,3.0,10/12/2015,"Love burgers and fries so this is my kind of place. But, when they is a huge crowd.. So hard to get good service. Went for lunch on Sunday w family. Took forever to get our order in... And after we received order, took about 15 mins for the waitress to come by! We had NO napkins NO utensils (kids needed) and sauce that was ordered for the fries were a no show. Trying to pay and get outta there took even longer! Spent 2 hrs there in total!

Let it also be known that they messed up my order and let me keep it but at the same time got me a new one, the one I wanted, in minutes. The management and our waitress were concerned with my table and myself and was not going to let us leave unhappy. They really knew how to serve. Great work by them all, I couldn't commend them anymore. I work with food/ food service and I know they did a solid job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40
Anony-mom C.,"Newtown, PA",40,189,4,1.0,4/27/2015,"I was invited to the grand opening and was very excited because I love red robin and i have a 14 month old so it's kid friendly. Gps got us lost and never found the address. Seems to be because it is a brand new shopping center it isn't on gps. Stopped to ask for directions and finally found it. We were ten min late for our reservation and our family of 3 that drove there after work from Newtown was turned away. I could see turning away someone after 30 min or so, not 10. They didn't care whatsoever when we explained the situation. We were incredibly disappointed and will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40

So, last night we ordered takeout, $64 worth, and it was hot fresh and very satisfying, not to mention for the amount of food it was very quick. When it comes to food my wife and kids are very picky, but it was nice to hear nothing but positive compliments.

Lizann D.,"Warrington, PA",4,20,4,4.0,6/12/2015,"Finally got a chance to try Red Robin after hearing great things about their burgers. And mine was great!  But at $14.99 one should expect a fabulous burger. My first time there was a Wednesday evening and there was a 40 minute wait. Spotted two empty spots at the bar so we grabbed those and ate much sooner. Two HUGE flaws; First issue, the place is too cramped on the bar side. The back of my bar chair constantly got bumped by staff and patrons walking by.  Second issue was how hot it was in there. We were melting. The staff behind the bar was sweating like crazy. They asked the manager to turn up the air to no avail. Staff relayed to me that the dining area is always freezing and the bar area is always hot because of a design flaw.  They work on tips behind the bar. What kind of tips can you expect when the place is too small so people eat at the bar and because it's hot they order water instead of a cocktail.   Second time we went for a late lunch, around 3:00 because I wanted to try again and see how the place felt when not cramped. It was much cooler. Service was fast. Much more enjoyable. I will come back here for a burger for sure but probably take-out or late afternoon meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40

Sandy B.,"Doylestown, PA",46,19,3,1.0,7/17/2015,"I love red robin's menu and its concept.  But this location had really bad service and wait time.  I'm surprised that a new location like this would be so unorganized and slow.  We arrived around 6:45PM on a weekday, we didn't get seated until 7:30PM.  The drinks didn't come until 7:45, food around 8:15, food portions were cold to the touch, had to send back, we were finally out of there at 8:45.  I just can't believe it took two hours to get burgers, fries and sodas together.  You have 3 people performing the hostess job, even with those fancy ipads, they still can't seat people down when there are empty tables.  Disappointing, will be driving to Quakertown's Red Robin when we feel the urge for this food...they comp'd our appetizers since it took so long, which was nice of the manager to do.  But our table had delays in apps and drinks, the table next to ours had their drinks and apps.  The table next to ours got seated after us too! But then we got our main course, while they are just getting theirs when we were done eating and paying.  Their timing is really off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=60
