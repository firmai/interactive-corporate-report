Selected appetizers are half off and beers are a steal. I'm not exactly sure about the prices, but domestic beers are around $3 a glass (large glasses) and imported are around $5. There are nightly specials on well drinks and margaritas too. My friends and I go here a lot.

Not hot like food is supposed to be, my fries and burger were almost cold as if it was sitting for a while before being delivered to my table. I didn't eat it, neither did my friends who experienced the same. We left. I decided to give it another chance for happy hour. The waitress was friendly but she only came to our table TWICE the hour and half we were there. We had ordered dessert with our drinks but only got our drinks. After finishing them we waited 20 minutes and she was still nowhere to be seen. We had to physically get up to ask a waitor to give us our check.

I got the steak both times which is my favorite. My husband got the chicken/shrimp which he was a fan of.  Last time we went was on Tuesday for my husbands birthday. I wanted to recognize, I believe his name was Austin. He was the host/busser. He opened the door when we first arrived, he sat us, and He continued to smile and help out all the tables. He even made sure we were okay. The first time we went here we waited 10 minutes for our server. That's why I gave four stars. However, the past time our server was excellent!

This place sells reheated frozen food.  I ordered a artichoke dip appetizer to compliment my beer.  While eating I found a nice chunk of artichoke heart.  I was excited.  It was like getting that single curly fry when you order regular fries.  It is an unexpected and pleasant surprise.   This chunk was not pleasant.  I expect that most readers have had a piece of food that had spent too much time in the freezer.  When thawed and cooked it has a slight flavor of the coolant used in refrigeration.  This chunk flooded my nostrils with freezer fumes.  Worse yet, the aroma lingered.  It killed my appetite for more.   This place still gets three stars.  The Manager, Joe? is a pleasant man who routinely checks on his guests.  The staff checked on me when they saw my class only had a 1/3 left of my beverage.  I was the only one on the patio and they did not forget about me.  I appreciate the attentiveness.   Go to an Applebee's for their Happy Hours.  They have two of them.  3-6pm and another from 9-12pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.34,3.4800000000000004

It is also easy to fix, but the management there simply refuses to address the issue.  This is the problem: We go there to enjoy an affordable meal and to talk with each other...we can't enjoy a conversation  because  1) THE BACKGROUND MUSIC IS EXCESSIVELY LOUD! We, sitting across the table from each other, are forced to compete with the loud speakers placed in the ceiling every 10 feet or so. Secondly, 2) POOR PLAYLIST SELECTION!  Instead of playing mostly instrumental music (i.e., classical, smooth jazz) which would be pleasant, pleasing, and conducive to conversation, they always play HARD ROCK stuff with lots of annoying lyrics!  You can barely hear yourself think with that crap going at high volume in the background. Never is there any quieter instrumental music being played.  I have spoken with the manager in the past (2-3 years) concerning this, but nothing has changed. He gives some bs-line about how the corporation sets the background music selection and volume...and he's not allowed to modify it.

Long story short, I decided to order a to-go or take out tonight. I ordered our two burgers well done, with no pink. & guess what? One of the burgers was pink as the panther in the middle and slightly pink towards the edges of the burger. If it was my burger usually I probably would have just said ""fuck it!"" and ate it, but with it being my girlfriends I told her we could trade burgers. Usually she complains about the slightest pink in the burger so I figured it would be no big deal, but I didn't even bother eating it with how raw it still was. I mean all the manager did was replace the order and as I'm walking out says"" I put a brownie and ice cream in there.."" Like I don't want no fucking ice cream and a brownie. It would have been nice to be reimbursed and maybe an apology, but that didn't happen. Then the manager didn't want to let go of the container with the pink burger when I tried to split he burger open to show him. Gas might be cheap, but time isn't.

93,E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17.0,4.0,2016-03-01,"This is another perfect example of a place that is not getting the credit it deserves. Hear me out, I'll tell you why I think this is true.  In all honesty, Applebee's franchise as a whole is pretty alright. It's not gonna wow you, but for what it is, it's pretty decent. I came back a couple times recently these past few weeks and again today. Prior to that I came here years ago, and in that time gap, they improved on their previous flaws. Like 3 to 4 stars inproved. How? The menu from what I remember has been simplified I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. There seems to be less stuff, granted there is still a lot of stuff to choose from, but i remember there being more. But what sacrificed for quantity, they made up for quality. The steak was actually cooked somewhat to my liking, I asked for medium rare, and it was medium/medium rare ish. Compared to last time and other franchises that serve steak you ask medium and it's well done. So props for Applebee's on that.  French onion soup had decent flavor, veggies tasted good, and the service is still really good. The waiters and waitresses are still nice and attentive.  Ok now the part that bugs me, and what I think is wrong with media, this site, and how are culture is today. I've seen other people's reviews on this place, like many others, I see there 1 star reviews... ok why. In the reviews I see positive things and people say ""good food,"" ""great service,"" ""overall good expeience,"" etc... then I see a 1 star review.... I see the flaws also and I can agree with them, but don't give places like that a 1 star. 1 stars are like worst of the worst, no redeeming quality whatsoever. Nothing good. Hense 1. If there are some redeeming or good things, fine give it a 2 or even a 3 stars. So it's fair. That's the problem, it just takes 1 mistake and ""yup, 1 star."" People today complain about the smallest things that I feel like they'll find anything to complain about even if it's something so small. Guys, be fair, if there is some good quality for it, then show it. Otherwise you'll be like me, reading other reviews and be like, ""ok if this place has good food and decent ambiance, why did it get a 1?"" That's like a teacher saying, ""oh your report on this subject matter was entertaining and I found it interesting.... F."" Wth?  If you don't like it here, fine you don't have to, it's fine.  But don't say some things are good and all of a sudden the end result is the worst grade ever. If that's the case, don't say anything nice at all if you're gonna give a place a 1 star. 2 or 3 fine, that means there's  ""some"" redeeming quality somewhere. But for me, my experiences have been good, if anything improved. 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=80,2.6,3.33,3.33,2.576,3.038

First of all while coming back from the bathroom and walking back to my table a waitress that was serving a nearby table ran into me with the tray and the dishes she was holding and barely muttered sorry. She actually ran to me with the dishes. I thought it was kind of rude but I still tried to give them a chance. Another thing is they lie about the promotion they have about giving you a free dessert if they failed to mention having a holiday drink and mentioning about gift cards. Don't think that you will actually get a free dessert if your waitress or waiter does not mention these things. Are waitress mention the drink but did not mention the gift cards and my entire table was positive of this but when we asked her about our desserts and she did not mention buying a gift card, she totally lied and said that she had mentioned it when we are positive she didn't. At the end of the day I really could care less about the desert, it's just the principle of the entire matter. Don't offer something if you are not prepared to be honest in giving it away. Overall really disappointing experience and I would avoid this Applebee's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3?start=40,2.84,3.14,3.14,2.2760000000000002,3.0200000000000005

Some of our favorite happy hour specials included the Grilled Chicken Wontons, Steak Quesadillas, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, and the Boneless Wings. The presentation was very good, and the portions for the price during happy hour were excellent. In regards to the Any Burger Monday specials, I was surprised by the quality and presentation of the meal. It resembled a burger you might get a specialty pub. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the garnish was excellent. During the football season, you can order any burger for $6.99.  You can't beat it.  Try the American Burger or the All Day Brunch Burger if you're craving a taste of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.    Several beers and drinks are also included on the happy hour menu. They had the standard and most popular light beers, Mexican beers, and a few IPAs. I went with a few on-tap beers, and my wife chose the ""Perfect Margarita."" The Perfect Margarita has Grand Mariner, it is was in fact perfect.

Only came here to use an Applebees gift card and Visa gift card my family received for Christmas. Asked our waitress (Debra C.) to ring up both cards before applying cash. Applebees gift card was $25 and Visa was $50. She only charged $41 on the Visa and never returned the card back to us. So we ended up having to apply more cash than we should have. Did she keep the $9 for herself. She continued to say ""that's all the card has on there is $41."" Then she said sometimes gift cards don't work right at restaurants. Then she said well maybe it automatically added tip. NOTHING made sense. We asked the manager to put the $50 back onto the Visa card so that we can just pay cash because you cannot scam asians! lol I've never had such a hard time using a Visa gift card in my life. Please check your bill before and after payment. The way they handle money here is sketchy. I don't know what she's pocketing or what is for the register.

4,Cole F.,"Chino Hills, CA",66,11,1.0,5.0,2017-12-15,This Applebee's has been around since I was a kid. My family and I used to eat here all the time especially after Church on Sundays. The only food I really have when I go here is chicken tenders with ranch dressing and fries. Their fries are probably my top five favorite fries of all time. I love going back to this place to have a bite to eat always delicious meals.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3,3.08,2.84,2.84,,2.9360000000000004
9,Jordan S.,"Chino Hills, CA",35,1,,5.0,2017-12-24,"After intense workout at my gym I decided to eat Applebee's, I went around 11:45 Friday night, I had an issue with one of the employees there because he had bad customer service skills and I ended up speaking to the manager Jenna, wonderful lady with one of the best customer service I've received, my intentions was never to go back to that Applebee's in chino hills California but the way she displayed professionalism change my mind and I will now be going back, the bartender that serve me also the one to help me speak to the manager, she had a very unique name and sadly I don't know how she spell it but without her I would have never even speak to the manager and none of those would have happen and they would have lost frequent customer. I should have put a review on Friday night but I just got the chance to. Thank you Jenna!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chino-3,3.12,2.88,2.88,,2.9760000000000004
