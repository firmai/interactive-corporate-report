Sydney R.,"Waukesha, WI",0,7,,4.0,3/10/2017,"10 dollar Unlimited Apps are back, and it's about them they bring them back!  This place is a hit or miss. I think it depends who you have as a waiter or waitress.  Sometimes the food can be bland and sometimes it can be amazing. So, the consistency can be off which is disappointing.  I love their mozzarella sticks and mash potatoes! It's my go to meal. Now with the 10 dollar app, I just do that and mash potatoes.  The place is extremely accommodating to me, and my service dog. They are very respectful.  I have never had a bad experience here. It's just the food can be great or okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield
Ronda D.,"New Berlin, WI",9,41,129,2.0,12/30/2017,"Not thrilled with our meal here tonight.  I ordered the bbq chicken salad- it looked sad when it arrived at my table. The lettuce was wilty, maybe over-dressed?- chicken was not enjoyable...tough and just not tasty. The onion rings were soggy and cold- not what I expected at all. My daughter ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken dinner. The chicken was delicious and she was pleased with it. The mozzarella salad that came with the meal looked old. The mozzarella looked like it had been sitting out for some time. Hubby ordered Really good burger- it was... in his words "" a good enough"" burger. We also ordered the loaded chicken nachos. Surprisingly, probably the best thing we ate. Our server was kind. But not too attentive.. and somewhat awkward. At end of meal asked if we wanted refills. ... a little late. Nice guy- just was not a great experience here tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield
Carol M.,"Las Vegas, NV",168,3,,1.0,1/13/2018,This is the worst Fridays location I've ever been to (including in Mexico & within different states in the U.S). The food was terrible quality and overpriced. We ordered a burger and the meat was dry and hard. Ordered the guacamole & chips as an appetizer & the chips were stale & the guacamole was black. We called the manager over and he didn't even bother to issue an apology he simple said all he could do this was take an item off the bill. We immediately asked him for the bill & got up & left. Highly disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield
Tom F.,"Brookfield, WI",0,5,,2.0,12/31/2017,I used to come here all the time. Last two visits have been really bad however in the past 6 months I noticed a slow decline.  Tonight the Bar area had 6 open booths all of them with dirty dishes and no sign of staff. People in the Bar didn't look happy so decided to leave. Other times waiters have been really slow and booths have been dirty. It's a real shame because I really like this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield

Rainy D.,"Oak Creek, WI",26,24,,1.0,2/17/2017,"My hubby and I visited this location for the first time. We walked through the side door which lead to the bar. We stood there a few minutes while servers walked past us a few times and the bartender glanced up. No one greeted us so we decided to look for a hostess. We get half way through the restaurant when a couple of servers noticed us wondering around and told us where the host was. We were seated, he told us the specials and said our server would be with us. We sat there for 10 minutes while 6 different servers and the hostess walked past us. They saw us. The host walked by so we flaged him down and asked for our server. The server never came. At this point, we're wondering if we even have time to eat as we had to be somewhere soon. We left and had to settle for fast food. This isn't how our Friday night out was supposed to start and I hate fast food. I was a waitress and bartender for 10 years. What was done today would have got my ass fired. There is absolutely no team work in that store. Everyone is all about themselves. With so many self centered employees, this will continue to hurt your business. Not one employee there even cares about that.  We will NOT come back and be treated that way again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield
Phil G.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",78,498,160,1.0,12/9/2016,"Wow, was this a sad experience. We left a Christmas party after 10:30 and needed something to eat having not eaten all day.  Options were slim as we drove towards our hotel in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  Friday's, a venerable chain from ""back when"" was open, and we sat at the bar with average expectations. While the food was far less than mediocre, the service was laughably bad.  What I can't understand is how a server can screw up an order when everything is computerized?  It is virtually idiot proof.  Thus, what is below an idiot? Is a moron equal or less than an idiot?  I ordered a simple Caesar salad, a cheeseburger and plain fries with no salt.  Our server/bartender forgot the Caesar salad, brought fries covered with cheese, and a burger.  He looked as us with bewilderment until a manager happened by, spoke with him, and said the correct fries and the salad will be right out.  My burger was pushed to the side.  About ten minutes later my salad and fries came out at the same time. Is a moron equal or less than an idiot?  I ate my salad, and then munched on my now dry burger and cold fries.  Is a moron equal or less than an idiot? We also asked this same server/bartender for two glasses of water, which he forgot.  I reminded him again, and he forgot again.  He got it the third time.  It was time to get the check and get out of there.  Realizing this bartender/server was missing in action for most of our time at Friday's, I knew I would have to ""flag"" him down.  I got his attention and asked for the check.  He nodded, walked away from us and promptly forgot that I asked him for the check.  Fortunately, he walked by us again, took a look at my incredulous face, and said, ""oops."" Is a moron equal or less than an idiot. The bill came to a little less than $30.00. I gave him a six dollar tip hoping he uses the money for prophylactic protection.  He should not have children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield

Jennifer R.,"Greendale, WI",94,286,99,5.0,11/18/2014,"Out of the TGI Fridays that I've been to, I would have to say that this one is probably the nicest. It is very spacious, with lots of seating, has a nice bar and a lot of neat decor throughout. The staff is very nice and attentive. Our server was wonderful and really made sure that we were taken care of.  We started out with an appetizer of their mozzarella sticks. We opted to pay a couple of dollars more to upgrade to the endless appetizers. If you know that a regular size order won't do, and if you love the appetizers, I would definitely recommend doing the endless option. It is $10 to do the endless appetizers, and it's actually a pretty good value.  For my meal, I had the sizzling chicken and shrimp entree. The chicken is all natural and marinated in garlic, along with the shrimp. It is served over melted cheese with onions and peppers, and comes with a side of mashed potatoes. It was absolutely delicious!  TGI Fridays also has good drink specials. Make sure to check the drink menu or ask your server what the current specials are. During this visit, one of the specials was $4 Long Island iced teas. It was very well made.  I will definitely be back to this location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield

Vika R.,"Savannah, GA",9,35,125,4.0,4/21/2015,"We don't have a TGI's where we currently live, so whenever we come back home to visit, we always stop by in one of the Milwaukee locations, but the Brookfield one is the one we stop in by far. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is nice. Even when it's crowded, it's still not obnoxiously loud, which I, personally, love.  I do have one gripe, however. Bring back shrimp scampi! I don't get why they changed their menu up and got rid of the shrimp scampi that came with the JD ribeye. That's what we were always looking forward to on our visits! Don't get me wrong, crispy shrimp is good...but not scampi good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield
Johanna L.,"Milwaukee, WI",108,371,97,4.0,2/2/2015,"You know, I've always been a Chili's or Applebee's person, mainly because I didn't have a TGI Friday's convenient to me.  Came to this one with some coworkers and I feel like I've been missing out!  They have a club, like Red Robin, where you can get free chips and salsa every time you visit, and sometimes get other deals too.  I recommend signing up for that.  I had a Cobb salad, which was a-okay.  I wish I'd been allowing myself to order other stuff, but I was trying to cool it on fries etc.   I'd really like to come back and try some of their mixed drinks that they have on the menu, though! Service was fine - nothing outstanding, but nothing bad either.  Decor is okay - lots to look at.  Atmosphere is typical for this kind of place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield
Kelly B.,"Milwaukee, WI",280,530,529,4.0,9/8/2014,"I was insanely shocked at my good experience at this Friday's. While I did check the other ratings, they were mostly based on poor service and didn't much reflect the food. I've eaten at my fair share of Friday's and know what I like and don't - so I was fairly confident I could find something to my liking. We were seated quickly and chips/salsa were brought out within a few minutes. Usually this free snack is offered only to Stripes members (which I happen to be) but Mike, our server, admitted to regularly sending them to all his tables to 'tide them over' while looking over the menu. While he said it helped to calm people down if he takes awhile, I liked the touch and we quickly polished those off.  On Sunday it was all day HH, so half off appetizers and cheap drinks. Long Islands were only $3 and still strong. I had... a few. We got the green bean fries as an app - a sort of small serving, but they were piping hot and the wasabi dipping sauce had the perfect amount of kick.  Our entrees were the sizzling chicken and shrimp, and the chicken and shrimp pasta. The pasta sauce had a nice cajun kick to it and was a big portion. The sizzling chicken had surprisingly great flavors, and the mashed potatoes were sooo good! Mike was attentive and friendly without being pushy and insistent. Overall we enjoyed our lunch here, and wouldn't hesitate to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield

Andy F.,"Waukesha, WI",17,135,1,3.0,7/9/2015,"Visited this location about a week ago (ba dum tss) with my fiancé, looking forward to a date night starter meal. We arrive here and get escorted to our table all the way in the back of the restaurant in the center between two families of screaming kids and a group of older folks starring at us and the families all awkwardly. Nonetheless we shook this detail off and proceeded to being waited by one of the most friendliest and most professional worker in this restaurant. I do not recall his name but I give all the props to him for such a turn around! Now, my fiancé ordered the fried chicken tenders and fries while I ordered the Jack Daniels burger with fries. The slush drink that I received with my meal was great, and my burger tasted really good, well seasoned, the sauce was quite sweet, and the fries were well seasoned. My fiancés meal was well seasoned as well, but I personally think there's something missing to it but it was pretty good regardless.  Honestly for the price I would of expected a larger portion or at least an additional side or two.  All in all, wasn't an awful experience, but wasn't the most amazing experience whereas i'd eagerly return for more. Maybe just a stop with friends and family, but not as a regular. Just another chain restaurant, really.  To the server, thank you for doing your best for making my experience that much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20

Terra C.,"Milwaukee, WI",51,46,5,1.0,8/9/2014,"Well I wish I could say that it was ok but I would be straining to say that. The only reason why I would give them one star was because the manager stepped in and tried to fix the issues.  Waitress came over to take our order. We were unsure if we should go with boneless or traditional wings. We asked her option. She was clearly annoyed by this ,cut us off and said she was going to get our water that she forgot. When she came back she asked if we made a decision yet. It was slow in the restaurant so it was not like she was swamped. 30 minutes later we finally received our food. We only ordered appetizers so 30 minutes is excessive. The wings we ordered were cold and they brought something we didn't order rather than one of the items we did. Once we finally got everything we ordered the waitress came over with her hands on her hips asking in a very sarcastic way if the wings were finally ok. It was so off putting we told the manager. She comped one of our appetizers which was nice but didn't really make up for all the issues. Highly doubt I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20
Jeff M.,"Milwaukee, WI",267,244,82,5.0,6/27/2011,"A while back I was asked what was one of the top bars in Brookfield, one of my answers included T.G.I. Friday's and it still does. From being greeted by a friendly host to being seated quickly to the cleanliness, this place just doesn't ever disappoint. The waitstaff knows what's going on with the menu and are able to make appropriate suggestions on what to try (especially when Friday's has new menu items). I can't remember a time that I had a problem with the food. I'm a cheeseburger enthusiast and the burger with the Jack Daniel's sauce is a repeated favorite of mine. I also enjoy a nice steak from time to time... and the butter-garlic sauce they put on it was very fitting. Mojitos are also good to order as your drink. Aside from mojitos, they have a bunch of drink specials to pick from and many other mixed cocktails to enjoy. I don't like giving out 5 stars to chain restaurants - but I really tried to think of a flaw so I could give it less stars, I couldn't think of any.

The entire staff is grumpy and robotic and slow moving (it's actually kind of impressive how similarly terrible everybody is. It's like they use an a-hole cookie cutter.) My most recent experience here almost sent me to therapy. My order and any special request were met with a stare that made me feel like a scum bag. I'm sorry that I asked what the salad dressings were. I'm a naughty boy and you deserve better (can we still be friends?). Everything came out exactly how the menu said it might. Unfortunately, not how I asked for it. I asked for French dressing and it came with ranch. No biggie, let's swap it out, right? NO! ""You SAID ranch."" That was it. No swap. Eat your ranch, idiot. The manager even asked if I requested ranch. I apologized if I slipped and said ranch, but I had to ask a manager to swap my dressing.

The manager couldn't fix the problem and gave us coupons for a free appetizer on our next visit.  My other complaint about this place is that the smoke inside the restaurant was overwhelming.  Though my Thai chicken wrap satisfied my hunger and provided the spicy kick I was craving, I doubt I'll be visiting this Fridays anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=20

I was enjoying my vodka cranberries that were easily the size of a double back at home. Sweet. I'm easy like that. Food, gave me the runs. Vodka cranberry? priceless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brookfield?start=40
