Mykala L.,"Weare, NH",23,1,,1.0,10/9/2017,"I downloaded this app just to write a review for this place... And I wish there was an option to rate them 0 starts, because 1 feels like too many. My boyfriend and I came in and could tell right away it wasn't going to be a good experience. First the hostess looked like she had a lot of better things to do than seat us. She did not welcome us, did not say ANYTHING until I asked for a table.  We then got to our table and started looking around at the menu. On the way to our table there were at least 6 tables that had not been bussed and made the restaurant look absolutely gross. Now don't get me wrong, I understand not being able to bus right away if you're busy, but we were the ONLY people in the place and every other employee was literally just sitting around.  Fast forward about 5 minutes and we still hadn't been approach by our server, asked about drink orders, nothing. Instead I was witnessing two of the employees sat in a booth, ON THE CLOCK, right across from me, supposed to be rolling silverware but instead starting making out and crawling all over each other. In the meantime, we overheard other employees say how someone needed to take Table 41 (our table) and how they were surprised we'd been sitting there so long. Even after this, no one came to us.  After sitting there for about 10 minutes, no server in sight except all of the ones doing nothing and the 2 making out, we decided to leave. ONLY THEN did a woman (who must've been the manager) came to us and asked to get us drinks. But ONLY when she saw that we were getting up to leave.  This place and experience was disgusting and I wouldn't recommend going to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12
Mimi Y.,"Boston, MA",197,47,253,1.0,3/13/2017,"I recommend the bar area if you ever come to this location. Never had a problem there but with all those other experiences this place is a one star location for sure in dining. Their foods the typical food chain.  Either over crowded or under crowded here. This joint either serves you or doesn't. They have such a high turn over with waiter and waitresses. Hard to keep up and remember who's a lifer at this location unless you're a regular customer.  A different occasion for a friends birthday we had a veteran server with a trainee. We've never seen our meals come out so slow. It was at least a party of 12-15. Waited over 2 hrs for food to come out and half our food orders were wrong once they came out. Mine was one of the ones that had to go back for a third time. It took so long I had to pack it to go. We didn't even get refills on our water either. Thank god I got one alcoholic drink.  I wonder if they ever got rid of that hostess who decided to seat me at a table full of Asians assuming I knew them which I didn't. I came in and she greeted me asking me how I was then I told her I was meeting with friends, somehow that translated to bring me to a table of asians. She just left me after I was in shock after I told her they're not my friends... I can't believe she brought me to a random Asian family who were clearly halfway done their meal. The other workers just stared and did nothing. Spoke to management over the phone a week later who didn't care or understood that's something offensive to someone. He just kept saying I don't see a problem.  So thank you TGFI, absolutely great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12

We were the only people eating there at that time, and would have expected fresh hot food. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, which was a soggy cheese mess. Then, our fries were cold, and seemed to be very old. We couldn't get the attention of our waitress, so we had get up and find someone to bring us new fries. We they brought them out, they appeared to be old fries, possibly put in the fryer to heat them up.

Went back on July 9th for a carry out order.  And this time they forgot to add an item...which any item there is never cheap.  Not only that, but the meal was horrible and made us both sick.  $32 for a horrible meal and food poisoning.  Unreal.

Alicia S.,"Boston, MA",61,589,27,3.0,2/14/2016,"We went there because another restaurant was so crowded. We should of went somewhere else. We got seated and our waiter was very quiet that I couldn't hear a word he said. He stood pretty far away from the table and talked pretty quiet. We waited 40 minutes for my boyfriends drink and 20 for the kids and I. The reason my bf waited was because he brought the wrong one and never brought over the right one. The food wasn't bad at all it was actually really good and if it wasn't for the other waitress bringing it out; we probably wouldn't of gotten it in a good time. The fruit cup that came with my son's was his favorite and I was impressed by the assortment. Overall, not bad for food but the waiter was very slow, not personable, and didn't seem to really care.

Doug K.,"Newington, NH",6,16,3,1.0,2/26/2017,"So so many options out there, I should have chosen another restaurant.  Instead, had my 3rd bad experience in 2 years.  Arrive 6pm as a party of 5.  Restaurant is moderately busy.  Hostess tells us 15-20 minute wait and takes my name, but does not give us a pager.  At 6:25, I approach the hostess to inquire about the wait.  She heads off to check the tables, returning to tell me that our table is open but just needs to be cleaned off.  6:40: I approach hostess again and ask if our table is clean yet.  She checks and returns to tell me it 'only needs to be wiped down.  6:50 hostess comes and brings us to our table, telling us Sebastian will be our waiter.  At this point, there are probably only 5 tables in the dining room with parities seated.  7:04, Sebastian comes and takes our drink order.  at 7:15 Sebastian returns with our drinks (4 waters and a fountain drink) and takes our order.   At 7:49 our food arrives, and the servers delivering the food apologize saying the kitchen has been backed up.   (But restaurant is almost empty).  We finish at 8:10 with no checks for quality of the food.  Very glad we were not trying to catch a movie!  On a positive note, the food tasted good and the waiter was pleasant, though seemingly inexperienced.

Corey H.,"Manchester, NH",73,6,4,1.0,12/28/2015,"So we rarely come here, for a couple of reasons. 1) they really have a limited menu, 2) customer service is ALWAYS lacking ... Just to name a couple.  Tonight, immediately sat. Appetizer and drinks ordered. We get our app in an appropriate time, albeit we ordered jack Daniels chicken, came out over-fried, (wicked crunchy), then while I write this, our drinks have yet to come, chicken, what could be eaten, was. No sign of our waitress or those drinks, meanwhile my partners getting irritated ""where's our drinks? Can we leave?"" It's always something when we come here. I've actually never left this place ""wow'd"". 14 minutes ago, I tagged us, still no drink meanwhile I see our drinks, sitting there getting watered down as the ice melts. 20 minutes in, girl says ""food will be out shortly gentleman"" as we look dumbfounded, she looks at our table awkwardly ""you didn't get your drinks?"" Tristan: ""no, they've been sitting at the bar for the last 10 minutes,"" another 3-4 minutes later, drinks at our table, watered down... Now to the meal: a small handful of fries, a sad 3oz piece of Chicken sitting on a piece of wood, yes a piece of wood ""supposedly gives the vanilla flavor"" and a very small portion of rice pilaf, probably enough to feed a small child. By small child, if infants are rice, this would fill them. Quality:  chicken moist, but not worth the price, fries were previously frozen and therefore I suppose ""quality guaranteed?""

Kristin J.,"Merrimack, NH",0,1,,1.0,5/9/2017,"I come to this restaurant often. I like the atmosphere, food, and the staff I have encountered. Tonight was a completely different story. I came to have dinner with my boyfriend and after the hostess (who is and always has been great) mentioned that they had new alcoholic drinks available we decided to try a couple. They were delicious. We ordered the beer pretzel appetizer and that was good as well. When it came to our actual dinners it was a completely different story. I ordered the JD burger - it's my go-to and I love it. My French fries were cold and my burger did not come the way I ordered it. I didn't complain and ate it. It still tasted decently. My boyfriend's dinner was... gross. He ordered the half rack of ribs with the steak, potatoes and vegetables. His vegetables were incredibly mushy and bland - again, not a huge deal. The steak, which was ordered as medium was the definition of rare and had more fat on it than I thought was acceptable. He just ate it and didn't say a word to our waitress... but when he got to the potatoes I couldn't believe it. First, there was plastic on the top of them, plastic! When he took that off of the top it revealed a long piece of black hair. When our waitress came over I told her what had happened. She asked him to put the plastic on a side plate so she could show the manager. He came over and apologized and told us not to worry that he would take care of it and get my boyfriend new potatoes. When we got our bill we were charged for his dinner. I assumed that when a manager comes over and says that it will be ""taken care of"" that it would be taken off the bill. Neither my boyfriend nor I are the type to complain or make a fuss about things so we paid the bill and left. I believe that when there is hair and plastic in your food you should not have to pay for it. We work hard for the money we spend when we go out. At the minimum we should be able to enjoy our food. We will not be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12
K R.,"Bedford, NH",0,9,5,1.0,8/4/2017,"If you want to feel like you're eating your meal inside a deep freezer, then this is your place. Honestly, it literally felt like it was 35 degrees in the place. The A/C was so cold and we asked them to turn it down as soon as we sat at the table. When we first were greeted at the front door by the host, a man who had zero personality we were told there were no booths that sat 5 people. When we were seated we could clearly see from our table a booth that could clearly accommodate a party of our size very close to us that was available. Back to how cold it was....it literally felt like the NORTH POLE and I had to ask my son to go out to my car and get a jacket that luckily I had left on the front seat but my kids and husband were left to shiver. We should have gotten up and walked out then but we were assured by our waitress that they would warm up the place. We placed our order and asked for my husbands burger to come out plain and well done. After shivering for a solid 40 minutes (to make sure it was well done I assume) it came out with some secret sauce at the bottom of the burger. We sent it back and asked to just forget about it since we couldn't stand sitting in this place for another 40 minutes in the freezing cold. They took the burger off the bill but my husband left without eating anything. We took a solid 15 minutes to defrost after leaving the restaurant. Overall it was miserable experience and a waste of money. All the other food we got was average at best. Service was ok.

The worst part is is they make eye contact and still don't come to check on you. They wonder why they have an empty bar at all times. This isn't the first time either. I've been coming here regularly for 2 years now and all of a sudden it's impossible to get a drink, a smile, and check. They really need to step it up if they plan on staying open.

Devin R.,"Manchester, NH",14,98,37,2.0,8/14/2011,"Let me first say that, generally, I find Friday's to be one of the better chain restaurant options around. Food is pretty good, lots of drink specials, good variety, photo hunt machines...all great. I generally go with the burger or ribs and am not disappointed.  Last night was a different story. We stopped into this one across from the Mall of NH to grab a small bite to eat...sat at the bar. The service at this Friday's is very good...all of the bartenders were friendly and attentive. Neither of us were too hungry, so we ordered the 3-for-All appetizer plate to split with our pints.  The platter came out pretty quick, and it became evident why this was soon after. The thing looked like it might have been sitting under the hot plate a while. I grabbed my first Garlic-Parmesan wing, and it was tiny, shriveled, and swimming in sauce, as if this was going to help the taste. (Generally their wings are pretty decent quality...no WIngs Your Way or anything, but enough meat on them to satisfy). These were terrible. We also chose the Green Bean Fries which we always enjoy. However, these were like Green Bean nubs...like someone had cut up all the beans into tiny pieces before tossing them in the batter and frying them up. The Pot Stickers weren't bad, but were a little soggier than I had remembered.  All in all the plate was a disappointment...and it did a real job on my stomach. Not good.  The other problem is that this Friday's needs some updating. Compared to the ones in Merrimack or Concord, you can see it is much older. Most of the bar stools are in disrepair...they feel like they are going to collapse underneath you at any minute. They really ought to spend a dime and get this fixed.  I'm sure I'll go to Friday's again and will have a better review of it, but the Manchester location missed the mark big time last night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=40

For the past year, however, the food has really declined. We always get the same thing - the Jack Daniels sampler, and something else like the fried green beans or pretzels, etc. I only eat the chicken and hubby eats the ribs and shrimp. The portions appeared to be getting smaller and smaller with each visit and the chicken pieces were less and less chicken and more just crunchy stuff. Last week, the shrimp looked terrible. Small, and seemed very much like frozen shrimp you buy at the grocery store and throw in the oven for a few minutes. My husband didn't eat it. The final straw was on Christmas day, we went and had our usual.  Again, the shrimp looked awful and everything was cold. I have to mention, there were not many customers in the restaurant at all.  Maybe us and two other families and a few people at the bar. Later that night my husband became violently ill to his stomach and is still not feeling well. We will definitely NOT be going back here and risk any further ailments.

Devin C.,"Bloomington, IN",103,70,,3.0,8/25/2011,"TGI Friday's has been at their S Willow location for a while, and I've frequented it plenty of times with my family. Over the course of their tenure in the southern New Hampshire area, their menu has changed from being large portioned to really slimming down the portions to broadening their menu to have both small and large portion meals. It seemed for a while they were having an identity crisis determining whether America wanted to keep it's oversized portions or to slim them down (to slim down America.) TGI Friday's is a nice restaurant for families. The price is OK, the food is generally good, and the atmosphere is great for a casual night out.  However, TGI Friday's clearly is targeted to those 21-40 today. Their drinks menu includes specials they change every month with reasonably priced drinks (3 dollar draught to a 6 dollar mixed drink, like a Long Island Ice Tea).  Personally - their decision to go to the 1 app, 1 entree, and 1 dessert for $13 (or $17 - depending on the meal you get) is a great choice.  For those who go there for a long time - usually I hang there for an hour or two, this meal hits the spot and nicely fills out the time you are there. Check out the deals Friday's has during the week too. On Tuesday night, 8PM - this Friday's location does Stump Trivia! at the bar area. It's a great trivia night, but lightly attended (since it just started.) It lasts until 10PM - but it is a great way to enjoy a night with friends during the week.  All in all, I think TGI Friday's as a chain is starting to come out of their identity crisis and focus on a young professional market. Ultimately, the company is moving in the right direction and this chain follows in that sense. The service at the Manchester store is great - the bartenders and wait staff who recognize you coming week in, week out, take time to say hi and spend some time with small chit-chat. These small things ultimately help me come back week after week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=40

Mj W.,"Tariffville, CT",30,98,7,5.0,2/6/2011,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants having been a career waitress at the kind of places that no longer exist with real chefs and table side cooking.    Anyways, this is one of the two chains that I actually like, they are consistent and not trying to be over trendy with a focus on food (which is something other chains seem to have forgotten) My choice was Bruchetta Chicken Pasta (without the chicken of course) and it was served with a generous drizzle of balsamic glaze, fresh garlic and chunks of Parmesan cheese,  It was enough to cover all the pasta, it wasn't served cold and it wasn't served dry-ed out from sitting under the lights, a noteworthy accomplishment for any place these days! Of course I poured some of the Jack Daniels sauce over it too, it actually compliments the entire dish, try it out because it's hard to go to this place and not have something to eat without that fantastic sauce!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=40

This place is offering $4 martini's and $2 beers right now so i feel they merit a decent write-up. They also have my favorite childhood tooy of all time hanging on the wall of nostalgia.....the Millineum Flacon....so back up bizzitches. However, the menu here is so plentiful and really runs the gamut. The dishes are creative and bold with the combination of flavors. where else can you get a cheesburger with platains?  They also do more things cooking with jack daniels than i can't remember doing drinking jack daniels. I'm a health freak so i almost always get the dragonfire chicken. I like that you can dictate the size of your portion. I love controlling how much or little i get and being priced accordingly. The hostess always has a bright smile on her face and my waitress always seems to materialize whenever i begin thinking about flagging her down.

Our waitress was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I hadn't been to a Friday's in years, so she helped us choose the best specials.

CJ G.,"Londonderry, NH",3,18,,1.0,11/4/2016,"We have in the past enjoyed our meals at TGIF's but over the last several months to a year we have seen the decline. Whether its the beer pong nights or the new groupie locals hovering in the corner by the bar, its just been going down. We went there a couple weeks ago to catch the Patriots game as we got to BWW too late and they were packed, TGIF's was practically empty. We thought ""awesome"" place to ourselves and we can watch the game. It took us long time to get our drinks or food, service was horrid. The bar tender was skulking over two drunk ladies at the bar. I say ladies very loosely as they were very young and trashed and making a nuisance of themselves and they were very loud indeed and fawning all over the bartender. At one point ice came flying across the room and it was the bartender, people on other side of bar and these two ladies throwing ice around. For many reasons just not cool. First a huge safety hazard, second not fair to patrons trying to eat, third bartender should know better then this behavior and 4th why is he still serving these two ladies as they are clearly wasted and obnoxious. Instead he continues to pour them drink after drink. They were lucky to be getting good service at least =). Please catch the sarcasm. We watched what appeared to be the manager berate a staff member in the back over smelling like pot. Could clearly see and hear this exchange which also included the cook. We watched the kid offer his shirt to be smelled by our waitress who leaned over and smelled his shirt and commented back to the manager her thoughts. Did this really just happen out in the open like that. Yea it really did. So flash forward to the other night, we go in for dinner, it was here or RedRobin and I wasn't in the mood to walk around the mall after which is ritual when we go there. So we opted to go over to Fridays. Big mistake. We both ordered our food, I ordered rib eye med rare and he ordered bourbon barrel chicken. We got our food a bit later and the steak was blue on the inside. It was so under cooked that it was tar tar with a slight sear on the outside. The waitress saw it and immediately whisked it away to the kitchen. Meanwhile foods getting cold so he starts eating his chicken. The manager comes over to us and asks if everything is ok and apologizes for the steak and asks if I mind them continuing to cook that one for me and sending it back. Sorry but that meal has been walked to me, cut into and exposed, walked back to the kitchen and now going to be put back onto the grill or oven or where ever and cross contaminate every one else's dinners and then re walk it back to me again and expect that this is ok, EVER... I looked at him and said I would prefer a new plate and he said no problem and went back to the kitchen. About 15 minutes later my dinner arrived to my table and he was already done his meal and I cut into the steak with our waitress standing there. It was even more uncooked then the first one as it barely even had a char on the outside and you could clearly see the bloody looking beef under it. She was embarrassed and apologized and sent it away, she asked me if I wanted another one and I declined and asked for the check. The manager came back over and said he didn't know what happened but that they will take care of this on them.. He said it like they were doing me a favor. He then hands me a card for a desert. You are kidding me right... I looked at him and told him I would like my check so I can go get myself some dinner as I am hungry and its been well over an hour now since I sat to eat. I ripped up the insult card he handed me and paid my check and left. Only thing removed was my meal that I did not get to eat (thanks for the ""on you"") We gave her 25% that we normally tip because it was not her fault. This place has officially gone to the lowest rung on the quality scale for me. It has changed into a place we need to avoid. I wouldn't think this place has long left to go judging by the lack of quality and poor management overall. Also after reading a lot of the feedback they have been getting its clear to see I am not the only one who feels this way. Its a real shame as this used to be a decent place to eat and frequent. After all of our years of patronage and hard earned dollars spent here, we will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=20

Haley B.,"Londonderry, NH",62,13,4,1.0,10/5/2015,"STAY. AWAY. My hubby and I went Saturday night around 8:00ish. We got seated right away, but the waitress took about 10-15 minutes to come over. Her name is EMILY. Of course, the people sitting next to us that had been seated after us already had their appetizer order in. She recommended some drinks off the drink menu, including some beer specials, specifically the bud light she pointed out was only $3 draft.. I ordered a bud light and he ordered a water. Every time we come to Friday's, he likes to get the unlimited apps. He likes to try them all and I occasionally pick at it. They are so small (maybe 4 or 5 pieces on a plate), and he is such a big guy, he can easily eat a few...He ordered one of the apps, and the waitress looked at me and said, ""what about you""? I said I was all set. She said no, they can't do that. It's $12 per person. I told her I wasn't going to get an ENTIRE app to myself. Even if it is small, I didn't want that. I was going to have a bite of a my hubby's. She told me her manager will not allow that and she will get in trouble..WTF? So what if a party of 20 comes in and only 1 guy wants the unlimited apps? The entire tables pays $12 each!? We come to Friday's all the time and I've never heard this before.. but I said FINE we will choose an app from the menu. I wasn't going to pay the $12 per person, especially if I didn't plan on eating any...She walked away and when we looked at the menu, the apps from the unlimited apps menu weren't on there, specifically he wanted the street tacos. She came back and said ""what app do you want"". We told her we would pass and just get side salads. CUE THE TUDE. Like we ruined her freakin' night! I ordered a side salad and she explained to me it was in a tiny oval dish...twice, like I was deaf and stupid...yea? and? She said it wasn't a lot. I mean, I know I'm not super skinny, but that's what I ordered. PUT IT IN! Instead she said I should get a wedge salad. We went back in forth a few times until my hubby interrupted and said YUP THAT'S FINE. Well, those two wedge salads took about 35 minutes. At one point, she came over and said one was ready, but not the other...sigh. So finally the food comes out. Hubby ordered some chicken that's served on a piece of a whiskey barrel or something. He cut it up and took a bite. He said it wasn't pink inside, but it had the chewy feeling like it wasn't cooked. He said it was NOT good. I got the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich (like I ALWAYS do). It came out and it looks actually good. I took a bite of my french fries and they were COLD in the middle. Like, they had either been sitting for a long time, or they weren't heated up all the way. I was so pissed, I didn't even touch my sandwich. We had been there for well over 90 minutes...she came back, hubby gave her credit card, he went to sign and she didn't give us a pen. It was then he also noticed the bud light was $5...Ugh, the whole experience was just a joke. I feel like if we had actually spoke up, she would chew our heads off. She had that kind of attitude.  I will NEVER EVER return to this Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=20

It wasn't incredibly busy that night, it was the first pats game of the season I think and there was a local hockey team there dressed in drag as some sort of tradition.  I don't know her name and I don't want to throw her under the bus but it is what is holding back from a fourth or fifth star.

We started off with the bottomless Spinach and Artichoke dip- which was, warm-ish, served with overly thick and crunchy chips. The whole thing was pretty off-putting so, we didn't order another one. My sister- her drink, some sort of fruity iced tea, was apparently great. Also, she said her Jack Daniels Burger was cooked perfectly BUT, it came with a bunch of stuff the menu didn't mention. Also, she couldn't eat her fries because they were SO salty. My mom- ordered a diet coke.  And got the grilled chicken skewers with double mashed potatoes. Apparently, most of the chicken was great(except for the two under-done pieces) but, the potatoes have tons of cheese in them (which none of us enjoyed) and it's not stated on the menu. Me- I had a water with lime. I just had the chicken finger basket with Mashed potatoes and honey mustard. Again, the potatoes were gluey, and a mess of cheese.(not what I wanted or expected). Also, they don't have ANY sort of gravy in the restaurant. All in all, I won't be going back, at least for awhile. Raw chicken, gluey potatoes, and cold dip, do not inspire me to become a regular here. =\",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=20

We got seated right away and our waitress (who was very nice) came over in about three minutes. We ordered apps (chicken , pub pretzels and potato skins) they came out in about ten minutes. Then we ordered our meals . Well I like sour cream with my potato skins , but hadnt seen our waitress is over 20 minutes so I asked another one walking by if she didnt mind grabbing me some and she said ""yeah""& walked away. Walked past our table multiple times literally staring at me giving me the dirtiest looks   and never brought me sour cream nor did she make an effort to tell our waitress her table needed something. Now I understand we werent her table so she doesnt need to priorotize us but still its part of the job to keep all guests happy and coming back. Because of this girl (not my waitress) I will literally NEVER go to another fridays again. She made us feel so uncomfortable the entire time but thankfully we were able to laugh hysterically over it. Once our food came we finally saw our waitress, who im assuming had a tough night which happens to anyone so she didnt ruin our experience really. But the food was cold and burnt at the same time, it was horrible . We just asked for the check , she must've known we werent happy and comped my meal.

Jennifer D.,"Antrim, NH",16,1,,1.0,9/12/2015,"This evening my fiancé and decided to go to a TGIF for a late dinner, I decided to get what I always get, a salad with a flat iron steak on it. Now it came with a cob salad which I simply asked if it could come on a house salad, which the waitress was happy to do.  My beloved got combo platter rib eye steak, and half rack of ribs with veggie and potatoes. The meals took a little longer than usual, but when our meals came out, my beloved 's looked good. My simple house salad, only had 5 pieces, chunk pieces of steak on it.  We simply asked if this looked correct, which the waitress shared she would check, she came back and asked if I wanted to work on the salad, or have them cook more steak and bring it all at once, I asked for it all to be at once.  By then I asked for another drink, I watch my beloved eat his meal, went to the bathroom, before my meal was brought back completed. My fiancé was done with his meal, a manager who I leaned later was the GM for TGIF stated that the right amount of steak was on the plate just not cut right.  He stated he would comp the meal, which by this time I simply asked to be packed due to not wanting to eat alone, and it was 930 pm at this point, and wanted to go home.   We arrived at the restaurant at 8:20 pm. So verse feeling validated, and apologized to, felt as if it was my fault for ordering this plate. The GM made excuses, and validated that this is how the restaurant makes this plate. Which by the way I have had before and it was no 5 chunk sized pieces. So for 2 drinks,  my fiancé 's meal, and bread sticks it was 44.00 with my meal comp'd. I won't go back, you could tell by the waitresses gave she was horrified, by the presentation, and clarification from the GM.

Shannon M.,"Portland, OR",3,9,,2.0,10/10/2015,The reason I'm giving a 2 is because the manager was so kind and listened to our frustrations about our server EMILY. Received terrible service and were apparently not the only ones whom have suffered through this poor excuse for a waitress. The worst experience I have had at a restaurant in recent memory. Would have loved to have had the server that waited on the table next to us. She had short dark hair with a headband and seemed to be great at her job. Emily is a detriment to your business. Will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=20
Sue Rose E.,"Manchester, NH",21,41,58,2.0,12/2/2013,Cold microwaved food every single time I go. They let all their great bartenders go and now the place is a joke. They have all these silly promos so all you have are rift rafts that go there. No thanks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=20
Flora S.,"Needham, MA",0,19,,1.0,7/25/2014,We were there this past Sunday. Service was fine but the food was terrible. Poor quality and quantity. The soup came as a 1/2 bowl and not a fill bowl and when I asked about it they said this is the amount that it always comes in. I had fried dumplings. They were cold and only partly cooked. My daughter had the steak and it was dry and hard as a rock. My other daughter had a kids meal : pasta and marina sauce. the sauce came is a bowel 1/2 filled and amounted to 2 table spoons. We aren't big eaters and were there for lunch. The food is really poorly cooked and poor quality and way overpriced for the amount served. Will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=20
Anissa M.,"Lebanon, NH",0,1,,1.0,1/16/2016,"My girlfriend's and I stopped by tgi Fridays for an early dinner. When we arrived we noticed they weren't busy at all. We got seated , got our drinks. Our server took our order. We ordered some nachos to start and 3 meals. After waiting a good 30 minutes for our nachos we politely asked our server if they were going to be out soon. She replied ""they'll be right out "". 5 minutes  later she comes back saying they are out of nachos, but our food will be right out. After another 30 minutes of waiting for our food we start getting irritated . We ask one of the hostesses walking by for a manager. The manager never came around. About 10 minutes later we get our dinner. My friends salad did not have the chicken on it she ordered. The server quickly comes out with a cold piece of chicken. We then asked our server for the manager for a 2nd time. The manager never came. When we are all done with our meals the server brings the check and says ""my manager took the nachos off for you"". At that point it wasn't just about the nachos. The experience was in all just awful. I take the check up to the host stand to try to talk to a manager (for the 3rd time)to explain why I didn't want to pay for my bill. I stood up there for about 5 minutes. Got completely ignored, then placed the check on a nearby table and walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-12?start=20
