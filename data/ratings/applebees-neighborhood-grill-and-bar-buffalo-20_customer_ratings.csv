2,Jessica G.,"Buffalo, MN",0,3,,1.0,2016-03-03,"I usually love this place!  Except the last time I went was the worst experience I have ever had at a resteraunt.  We arrived with a party of 9. And I understand that is a lot.  A wait is expected.  We arrived and the hostess said it would just be a few minutes.  It was a weekday evening so it wasn't very busy. We waited 20 minutes before going to the hostess and asking how much longer it would be because we had been waiting awhile.  She became very rude and telling us she had no idea, and that when she told us it was going to be a few minutes, that was just a guess and we can't hold her to it.  We brought up that there were two tables that could be pushed together for us that were empty. The hostess went and asked the waitress if she could put them together.  She was told no. So we waited another 25 minutes.  45 minutes of waiting only for them to put the two tables that we requested earlier together anyway. They brought our silverware to us unwrapped and in a pile, so we had to divide itbourselves. I had to ask for a high chair twice, and then the one they gave me was broken so they had to get another one. The waitress hardly came to our table after taking our order. I had to go to the bar to get a refill on waters for the table. We got no apologizes from any of the staff. The manager actually seemed scared to come to our table and didn't even bother. I was so stunned at the service. I'm usually very laid back about this stuff, but this was just plain rediculous. Never again will I go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-20,,,,,

A couple minutes went by and finally a waitress says I'll be right with you. 5 minutes later and after stopping at three other tables, she decided to help us. That was really frustrating after a long day. We left and probably won't be bzck for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-20,,,,,
1,Alan S.,"Roanoke Rapids, NC",5,143,393.0,1.0,2017-07-07,"I used to dine regularly in Applebee's and it was usually good.  I came in to Buffalo MN Applebee's this afternoon at 3. There were very few patrons. I sat at the bar, the bartender was great but she left after taking my order. ( Shift change ) Jeanette took over. She never smiled, barely waited on me and let the bar phone ring for 8 mins straight!  I ordered Bourbon Street Steak. It arrived cut into 2 pieces.... why ? Jeanette asked sharply, if I wanted anything else...  I said no thank you.  She immediately handed me the bill. I paid and rounded amount up to 30 which amounted to about 3 buck tip. I explained that I usually always leave 20% plus but the service and 2 piece steak was very bad. I also said sorry.  So I pray your experience is better.   In contrast, Applebee's in Mankato is actually great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-buffalo-20,,,,,
