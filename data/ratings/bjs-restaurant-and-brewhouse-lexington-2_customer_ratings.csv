88,Katie F.,"Lexington, KY",11,100,346.0,4.0,2016-06-29,"BJs Brewhouse is where it's at! I have been to another location in Indiana and it never fails! Probably one of my top 5 favorite chains here in Lexington! BJs' menu offers a wide variety of selection and has a wonderful ""EnLIGHTened"" menu with items under 750 calories. I would say their menu selection is almost comparable to the Cheesecake Factory in that there's something for every taste bud. In fact, the menu can *almost* be a tad overwhelming, simply because of how many things that are offered!  The atmosphere is a little industrial inside and has a fun/nice feel. This is a place you can dress up or dress down and feel comfortable!  One negative is the prices. I would say BJs is on the higher end, price wise, and wish it was a little less expensive.  My husband and I went on opening night and I expected it to be a little hectic. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful but they did mess up our pazookie order (PS you HAVE to get a pazookie!!!!). She said she would give us a coupon for a free one and ended up forgetting, I think. They gave it to us in a ""to go"" container, even though we didn't ask for it like that, and I think we got a smaller size which was really disappointing. Again, this was on the opening night so I do have a little more grace, given the craziness!  Oh, one more thing- I wish they had outdoor seating! The other location I've been to has a really nice area for sitting outside and I love to eat outside so that was a little disappointing.  I will definitely go again, and go frequently!! I'm so glad Lexington finally got a BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2?start=40,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003

They've been open 5 days in Lex. It is an absolute epic fail! Took over 35 minutes for me to get water to drink. This is worse than ""just a few kinks.""

81,Julia B.,"Lexington, KY",23,2,1.0,1.0,2016-07-07,"The disappointment I felt when I unpacked my to go order was absolutely crushing. My fiancé and I were really excited to see a BJ's open up here in lexington since we tried one in Louisville and the food was magical. First off, my fiancé had to wait for our food for about 20 minutes on top of the 20 minutes it took us to get there after ordering. When he came out he said it seemed there were a lot of pissed off customers. Well, I became a pissed off customer when I saw my order had been completely botched.  I got an appetizer sampler that came with egg rolls, spring rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, and mozzarella sticks. Instead I got the egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, and Plain boneless chicken wings.  It didn't come with any sauces either..yeah thanks for the plain chicken. :/ So I didn't get half of what I ordered and I didn't get any sauce for what I did get. HUGE FAIL. I called to complain and the girl said I'd receive a call from their manager the next day to resolve the issue. Its been four days.....I wouldn't try out this place until it's been opened for awhile and they work out their kinks.

20,Dennis W.,"Lexington, KY",246,163,626.0,2.0,2016-07-15,"Bland food and mediocre service earned this visit a 2-star rating. === === === === Out with friends, we were interested to try BJ's to socialize and get our grub on. As we arrived, the hostess greeted us and asked if we had ever been there before. Saying no, she explained that our server would tell us about their rewards program and take good care of us.  Unfortunately, neither of those things happened. I still couldn't tell you one thing about their reward program, as we were never told about it. Our server did, however, take our drink orders and give us time to look over the ridiculously large menu. We decided to order the honey sriracha brussel sprouts for an appetizer while we continued to look over the menu.  A good 8 minutes passed before we saw our server again. We made our orders, and thanked her with words and a smile - and she just stared at us and then walked away. Ok. A moment later, someone else brought us the appetizer. The sprouts were over-done and a bit bitter because of it.  Eventually, the main courses arrived and we dug in. My friend and I split a deep dish pizza. Sadly, pizza hut's deep dish is better than this was and that's even including the heartburn I get from pizza hut. This pizza was not hot, the crust was not crisp, and the toppings were few and far between. Clearly, whomever made this pizza hated pizza. Oh, and another thing that I am NOT a fan of is making the server serve the first slice. No, just no. She pulled up on a piece, that clearly wasn't fully sliced because it was stuck to the two adjacent pieces, until it gave way - which in turn, flipped one of the pieces upside down. Then she does the same thing trying to serve a piece to my friend. And then, she hovers over my food while she's trying to get the slice she accidentally flipped to flip back to a cheese-up position. What a mess.  I could continue, but I think if you're reading it this far that you get the point.

My pizza was just average and it did not have any sauce. One of the people in my group got fish tacos and they tasted real fishy. And one burger cooked wrong, cold fri's, and bacon was way undercooked. We also had the cookies and they were small and not much to them. Two other meals were just ok.  I will not return to this place I would have a hard time giving this place a one star.

43,Jason B.,"Lexington, KY",1,12,3.0,3.0,2016-07-27,"Deep dish pizza worth trying, but nothing that will blow you away. As far as the pizza and beer goes, this place was pretty good overall. They were pretty skimpy with the cheese and toppings, so I can't rate it higher for the price. The service was fairly bad, as they forgot part of the order and took quite a while to even greet us. However, everyone was friendly and I have had much worse service, so not a huge deal. The house beer is good and worth trying. Skip the shareable appetizers. We got the pot stickers and there were 6 I think for almost $10. That would be probably $5 anywhere else, and they were nothing special. Although we didn't get it, the spinach and artichoke dip was also almost $10, which is ridiculous unless it comes in a trough. I would give it another chance since it just opened and my complaints might be fixed when it gets rolling. I would say the pizza is a notch better than Old Chicago, but the value is worse, and the service was worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2?start=60,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

Took about 45 min to get our food from the time that we ordered. Then one order was wrong (they said so before they even brought it out) so we had to wait for them to remake it. Plus once we got our food had to wait about 10 min longer for missing utensils and condiments and drink refills. The food is fine, not spectacular but the service is so bad I will not go back. I had to fetch several things for our table myself (kids menu, salt, and snagged another server for things I couldn't get myself).  Definitely not worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2?start=100,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005
18,Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1368,1368,6019.0,4.0,2016-07-30,"Just be aware that the service is slooooow, so go into it with at least two hours to spare. We checked in at 6:23 on a Friday evening and were told that the estimated wait was twenty minutes. At 7:00 luckily we scored a bar side first come, first served walk up table. So they apparently don't even know how slow the service is.  With a fantastic name like BJ's, I really wasn't sure what to expect, yeah I went there and I was the first one to mention it. It kind of reminded me of a sports bar, but the employees are all dressed up, so it's a bit different. They have a ton of brews posted on the back wall, some of which they brew themselves... in Texas. They also have wine and a fully stocked bar too, so don't let the brewhouse part of the name fool you either.  From the time that our table finally got cleaned off, our drinks arrived about twenty minutes after we ordered. I decided on the bison burger. With its fancy toppings and load of barbecue sauce, I thought it was pretty good. If you decide on the bison burger, do keep in mind that it comes pink and that is normal because bison isn't as greasy as hamburger, so well done would make it too dry. I learned that from my friend Ted, who happens to serve up the best bison burgers in Lexington. I also tried the boneless chicken wings. You can choose from a variety of sauces, but we chose the hot barbecue. The sauce wasn't too bad, but I don't recommend it if you're a lightweight. They were perfectly battered and the chicken was white meat. When we were waiting for a table, they brought around deep dish pizza for us to sample and I will say that it was excellent! Everything that I tried was great. Their only problem seems to be the slow service. Lets give them a chance though, maybe a few months to get some experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192

21,Rob B.,"Lexington, KY",88,71,132.0,3.0,2016-08-01,"I have now tried BJ's three times and I have enjoyed the food on each of the visits. (Trip 1: Deep Dish Pizza and Calamari; Trip 2: Boneless wings appetizer and Salmon entree; Trip 3: Wedge Salad and Tavern Cut ""Spicy Pig"" Pizza.) I enjoyed the calamari and the portion size was definitely adequate. Their version of deep dish pizza was good but not the best I have ever had. The crust needs to be more crisp. But it   was not bad. The boneless wings with the lemon pepper dry-rub were good and also plentiful. The salmon was flaky and tender. On my third visit, I was OK with the food but the portions were paltry. The wedge salad was small. Most places seem to serve about a half head of lettuce with a wedge salad. BJ's wedge was about 1/4 head of lettuce--more like a ""kid's portion,"" but at $3.50 as an ""add on"" I wasn't totally disappointed. The Spicy Pig Pizza was good, but not ""wow."" ""Tavern cut"" is apparently a copyright's creation for thin crust. The crust was good but it was virtually impossible to tell if it had been sliced into slices so it became a ""pull apart"" situation which is somewhat of a problem with pizza toppings.  On Monday nights, BJ's pizza is half-price, so the pizza was $7.50 as opposed to $14.95. Based on the size, at $7.50 it was a good value---at $14.95 I would have sent it back and said ""no thanks."" It would barely feed two people and certainly not two hungry people. It is by no means worth $15. It is served in an oval and would average out to be about a ""medium"" at best. My overall reaction is that is overpriced, all things considered. Perhaps it is because of the rent being located at Fayette Mall, But no matter, if the food isn't improved for the price, it won't be difficult to get a seat there in due time. It is average food with an above average price. That doesn't bode well for the competitive Lexington dining scene. ""If you build it, they will come"" in Lexington, but if the food is just so-so, they generally won't return.  It's somewhere between Yelp's 2 and 3 stars in rating...about 2.5. But it is new and there is time to address some issues I have heard from friends who have also eaten there about their experience with slow service and incorrect orders. My experience on three trips is the service has been adequate. Your mileage may vary. I will say that their customer loyalty program does offer some good discounts. Hopefully they will step up their service and improve the food quality so that the Lexington location is as good as those in other cities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2?start=20,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

We were told they'd be a 90 wait when we went on Saturday and it was probably about 45 minutes which I didn't think was bad. They were SUPER packed. They had an appetizer or pazookie special with a coupon so we had to take advantage of the chicken pot stickers (super good). We then ordered our entree. I had the beer batter fish and fries. Very good, but so much food. Nothing tops their pizza in my opinion regardless of what else I've tried on the menu. Then we split the cookies and cream pazookie which I have to give two thumbs up.

96,Carlos H.,"Lexington, KY",8,42,,1.0,2016-08-05,"I thought it would be fun to take my wife here for lunch before we saw the latest Jason Bourne film. We arrived at the restaurant and were seated at about 12:15 p.m. We waited for 5 minutes before our waiter appeared for the first time, and we gave him our drink and food orders. Twenty minutes after we gave him our food orders, food finally arrived. The waiter was MIA for most of the 45 minutes we were at our table. Unfortunately, this was some of the worst food I've had at a Lexington restaurant in YEARS. Trust me, by late November, holiday shoppers will wish Fayette Mall had not eliminated more parking spaces by adding this restaurant. For starters, the list of items on the menu is far too large, and it's never a good sign when one restaurant tries to tackle tacos, pizza, hamburgers, and several other kinds of food. Also, there are at least two items on the menu with the same name (The Classic -- one is a sandwich and the other is a baked potato). My wife ordered The Classic, thinking she was getting the sandwich with a salad. Instead, the waiter brought the baked potato and the salad appeared much later after that. Wendy's baked potato is just as good as the one my wife had at this restaurant. Her salad, while it looked fresh, was drenched in dressing. At least her meal turned out to be free. While the menu states that many of the hamburgers include a special sauce, my hamburger was not supposed to but did anyway. The hamburger itself was almost as thin as a McDonald's hamburger, it tasted gross, and it's been giving me digestive problems for the last 18 hours. The French fries are the kind Steak and Shake serve, and they have no flavor/seasoning. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT.

The Bad:  wait for the food, staff that were slacking, hot wings, wait for beer, staff who have no personality and do not follow the norms of being a server. The Rundown:  this is a chain that is new here to Lexington and I have to say I will not be back after only one visit.  Their beer selection while decent and varied, even offer some of their own unique selection took a full 20 minutes to come out after ordering.  Our appetizer of their boneless wings took another 10 minutes.  We ordered their spicy and hot, and their exxxxtra hot.  Literally I couldn't tell the difference in heat level.  I will say the exxxxtra hot tasted better.  Worse about their wings was the egregious under saucing, they came out looking dry.  Also, apparently if you ask for blue cheese you get ranch, and you won't be able to switch it out because your server won't come to check on you.  We also got a deep dish pizza, which was as good as a delivery version, and a brisket bacon BBQ burger.  These two items were the saving grace of this place.  The wait staff could be seen hanging around, sitting in booths with customers or chit chatting with each other, this leads me to wonder why is my food and drink taking so long when they apparently have nothing to do?

22,Michelle R.,"Nicholasville, KY",24,130,302.0,3.0,2016-08-11,"This was out 1st visit to this BJ's. We had picked up a gift card at Kroger (gotta get those fuel points) for here because we knew we wanted to try it. The menu is spiral-bound and quite lengthy although many of the pages are drinks. The chain has their own beer line as well as their own line of sodas. They have a wide variety of food from pizzas and salads, to burgers and quinoa bowls. I had the lake and Brussel sprouts salad and added grilled chicken. The salad itself was outstanding and I loved the strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The only issue I had was that the chicken was extremely salty.  It was so salty that I picked it all off and didn't even eat it. When our server stopped by to check on our food, I asked him why the chicken was so salty and he said they must have put too much seasoning on it. He assured me that he would remove the chicken from our bill. When he returned, he said that the manager just removed the whole salad and not just the chicken. That was above and beyond as I ate the entire salad minus the chicken but I appreciate that they wanted to make sure we had a good experience. Okay so whatever you do, save room for dessert and get the Monkey Bread Pizookie. It is AWESOME!

I waited 50. They brought everyone but mine but never explained why I had the extra delay. Our waiter NEVER once refilled our glasses unless we asked. He only brought me one drink in 2 hours and never offered to bring another. The kitchen staff were extremely slow and I found it to be poor service that the manager didn't offer to explain the situation with the eggs or even send out to somewhere close and get them.

Either the set crew didn't show up or it is one of the worst in the business. Both times our meal nearly two hours from the time we were seated to the time we paid our check.

We ordered the 9"" Mediterranean pizza and can honestly say it was the best pizza I've ever had.  The combination of about 6 different toppings from excellent feta cheese to olives and fresh tomato left a pleasant taste in my mouth for hours.  The pain will come when the credit card bill arrives.  But it really was worth the price. We both had a beer, my friend had a hefeweisse and I had a local brew.  I found that the local brew was probably twice as expensive as I expected, as I don't check beer prices regularly.  It was good, but it wasn't THAT good.  But the pizza.  Yes, the pizza! In all honesty, I can't say I'd come back here often.  Each time we go to Lexington (live an hour away) we try a new place, anyway.  Today was BJ's turn.  Can't say I was disappointed overall, but will not be a regular.

91,Becky R.,"Lexington, KY",123,2,,1.0,2016-09-14,"I was excited to finally have the opportunity to try out the new restaurant in town BJ's Brewhouse. It was built right by the mall on the corner of a large intersection and so I anticipated that it was going to be a popular dining spot. So when I went to dinner there I had relatively high expectations because of its size, location, and style of restaurant. I figured it had to be really good from the looks of it. I walked in on a weeknight and was quoted a 15-20 minute wait time. They asked for my number and told me to anticipate a text when our table was ready. So after 35 minutes of waiting and checking my phone and listening for my name to be called I was becoming more and more hungry and anxious. I went up to ask the hosts about the wait and they had nothing to say about it but that our table would be ready soon. So after a 45-minute wait (twice the time we were told) we sat down. We were relieved to finally have our table and were prepared for the rest of the night to be enjoyable. We were eager to order but the menu was large so we ordered drinks before ordering our food. But our waiter was less than enthusiastic about helping us explore the menu and stopped by to ask us for our order twice before our drinks were even brought to the table.  After we ordered our food, it was another long time waiting for it to come out, but we didn't really mind it; we were enjoying our time and our drinks. So when the food was finally brought out we were hungry and excited to dig in. But before either of us had taken a bite of our food our waiter came around the corner over to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert! We hadn't even started eating yet after waiting for our meal for well over an hour now and he was asking us about dessert! We told him we weren't ready to look at desserts and he walked off. A few minutes later he came back and asked us if we wanted boxes. We were still not even halfway through our meal. At this point I started becoming irritated. Before now it was just a time issue that I would have overlooked because the food was worth the wait. But now I was being rushed and interrupted after waiting for so long to get my food. I can't recall worse service in a restaurant. I am not the type to let a flaw in service ruin my entire experience but this lack of good service was appalling. I simply expected a positive experience with trying out this restaurant for the first time and the service I received was far from that. Not only were the wait times given to us incorrect and irritating, but also the waiter rushing us out the door was downright frustrating.  I would recommend this restaurant to put a heavier focus on how they treat their customers and how their services are executed. A customer should be treated with respect and employees should be trained appropriately to serve them efficiently and without rudely pushing them out the door.  I also recommend that the hosts never quote under the actual wait time. A customer quoted longer wait times will be less irritated when their wait time is shorter than they are told. But if a customer is told a short wait time they become irritated when that time is extended to being twice as long.  If BJ's values having its business become successful in Lexington they will need to look into making changes. Because from my experience the rude and poor service is not worth the wait and I will probably not give them my business again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.6600000000000006,2.16

Additional portions were not well priced. No one wants to pay $20+ for a salad at a burger place.  To be charitable, service was lacking. While being nice and friendly goes a long way, being wholly inattentive does not. BTW for a restaurant calling itself a brew house, I found it ironic that our server never brought my beer order.

I have since found a couple of items that I have enjoyed there now: their Poke appetizer and the Strawberry salad is very good. But I will say it's not enough to keep me going there as much as before. They are pricier than restaurants that are like them; so I don't think they will be around very long.

46,Jessie A.,"Henrico, VA",0,3,,2.0,2016-10-10,"This place is pretty awful. I have never seen a restaurant so slow and indifferent. We showed up for a friend's bday dinner around 3PM Saturday. The mall had some sort of power problem which, I know can't really be helped. But the way the restaurant handled this situation was horrible. When we walked up to the door we were met by a host with a bad attitude. She pretty much looked at us and said she couldn't let us in because there was no power. Okay, fine but did she have to be so rude with her tone? Of course not. Little did I know this is just how this restaurant is run.  The power came back on about 30 minutes later. We walked in to be met with a bunch of servers. We were told it would be 20 minutes until we could get a table. WHY? All the tables were empty yet we were only allowed to sit in the bar area. Again, WHY? What would have been the harm in letting customers sit at the actual tables? The power was on and everything was working. So odd. At this point I didn't even really know if I wanted to eat at this place. It is obviously poorly ran. After sitting on one the benches in the front for like 10 minutes we finally decided to sit at the bar. The bar area is cramped, not cool.  We sat waiting for like 15 minutes for our server to come up and grace us with his unfriendly presence. He didn't tell us his name. Didn't tell us ANYTHING about the drinks or food they had to offer. WTF? This is honestly the first time that has happened to me. He took our drink order and disappeared for 20 more minutes. At this point we practically live at this place now. There was a UK game on like 10 different TVs. So, I'll take this opportunity to congratulate  BJ's on having enough TVs for a small village.  Anyway, the server came back. Gave us our drinks. Well, half of us anyway. My husband didn't get his beers for another like 10 minutes. At this point we don't have actual menus and our server disappeared again. We had to get up and ask for menus. They didn't even have enough for our table. Did the menus leave when the power went out? We will never know.  Now on to the food and the menu. I've watched enough Gordon Ramsay content to know that he would absolutely die over the size of BJ's menu. Okay, it's fancy looking. I mean it's in a spiral book. There are literally like 20 pages. That is TOO MUCH. You know what else was too much? The prices. Who in their right mind wants to pay almost 10 dollars for like 5 brussels sprouts with some sriracha on them? We were taken aback by the prices but at this point we felt like the band on the Titanic. We were going to ride this ship down. Once our server decided that we might want to eat some time before death happened he came over and once again didn't tell us anything about the menu, specials, nothing. We ordered our food and then began the wait.  The food took about 25 minutes to come out. It didn't come out all at once. In the restaurant world you want your tables food to come out all at the same time. I got the mozzarella and tomato salad. It tasted fabulous. So, way to go on that! Everyone seemed to like the food. So I can't say anything bad about the actual food. Presentation was great, quality was great, portions were great for filling your tummy (but I'm not going to praise those prices, still too much). The ONLY complaint I do have is that the server didn't give refills. No one was surprised by this at this point.  The server gave us our checks, well kinda threw the books on the table and walked off. We all paid with cash so as we were gathering the money together the server was creeping. One of my party members went out to smoke. I was waiting for him to come back to give his portion of the bill. The server would NOT stop trying to take the check. I told him I was waiting for another person to chip in. He was in some sort of hurry to get that money. Oh, so now you're speedy? He also stood around obviously trying to see what his tip was going to look like. Most annoying server EVER.  Needless to say I'm not going back to this place. I don't know WTF is wrong with the managers here but they must not know what they are doing. I honestly thought it was because of the power outage but the other reviews here sound similar enough to my own experience that it's kinda obvious this place has major problems. It's in such a good location in Lexington. It's a shame it probably won't survive. The building looks very nice but appearances do not go very far when the servers seem unfriendly and brain dead and the service is so slow you start to seriously think about leaving.

Food quality is good and my waitress was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the offerings in the menu. There are a lot of things, almost like a Cheesecake Factory menu, so it can be a little daunting if it is your first time there.  Is it expensive? Yeah, kinda sorta I suppose, but this isn't Applebee's or O'Charley's. It's a step above and priced accordingly I feel. You could definitely drop $60-80 on a dinner date with appetizer, drinks, dinner and dessert.  A lot of reviews will complain about the speed and/or quality of service.

For the $17 price I would expect more meat in the dish. It had plenty of shrimp but should have had more chicken and I couldn't even find any of the andouille sausage that was supposed to be there. Plenty of fresh bell peppers and onions. My girlfriend felt like she could get a better meal at O' Charley's.

The menu looked quite extensive, but also expensive (for this type of restaurant), especially for the portion sizes. I ordered the top sirloin steak which the menu  did not list a weight for the steak, but I figured at $15.99 it had to be at least the standard 8 oz. Maybe it was the fact that the last quarter of my steak was an inedible stringy mess, but the steak did not seem of adequate size. The side items I chose were the house salad and white cheddar mashed potatoes. The salad was a standard mix of greens (iceberg and romaine) , tomatoes, cucumbers, and croutons, and sadly ended up being the best part of the meal. The potatoes came out in the shape of an ice cream scoop, reminiscent of cafeteria food, and had dried out terribly. I'm a big girl, I like to eat, and I hate wasting food, but I couldn't even finish my meal.

I ordered the deep dish baked ziti ($15) that is supposed to have pepperoni, meatballs, and sausage in it. It was a small portion size as the pan they baked it in and served it in was only about half full and there was 0 pepperoni and only a small amount of sausage and meatball. So I felt that $15 was a bit much to ask for a small, non deep pan of pasta with cheese and sauce on it.  I did see many burgers being served at other tables and those did look good.

Go for dessert after you have a nice meal elsewhere, or have dessert elsewhere too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

3,Kate S.,"Lexington, KY",23,94,43.0,1.0,2017-10-21,"I'm sure there are lots of things this chain does well...I just have absolutely no idea what they are. This was my third time at BJ's Lexington, and it will be my last.  I try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt, especially on my first visit, but the benefit of the doubt is not what this restaurant needs.  The food is terrible, the drinks are weak and overpriced, and the waitstaff seems not at all concerned about getting their customers what they need...unless it's another drink...but not of water. I first tried this chain in California, and I will admit that once I saw that they served a French dip sandwich, I didn't try many other things.  The French dip was really good, tender medium rare sliced beef with cheese and sautéed onions  on a toasted roll.  It was truly delicious.  When BJ's opened in Lexington I was excited to try the French dip again; it wasn't even the same sandwich.  I actually sent it back to the kitchen, a rare occurrence for me. My second meal here was with a friend.  We ordered drinks and appetizers.  I was told they didn't have Grey Goose vodka, so I settled for whatever they said they had.  When we were leaving I saw the Grey Goose on the bar shelf, so I asked about it and was told that the happy hour price didn't include premium vodka.  I would have liked to have been given the option (but I wasn't) and would have opted to pay more for the vodka I like.  We hadn't intentionally arrived during happy hour so that wasn't a draw for me. The third/last visit tonight was to satisfy a deep dish pizza craving.  My husband and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait 40+ minutes for a table (I counted 8 empty tables and there were several groups waiting to be seated).  We ordered two drinks and asked how long the wait would be for pizza - 10-15 minutes.  Over 30 minutes later, with no pizza and no offer to refill our drinks, we were rethinking our decision not to order an appetizer.  The pizza did arrive, finally, and it was the sorriest excuse for a pizza I have ever seen.  Seriously, DiGiorno would have been better.  Micro toppings, no sauce, and a prefab crust that was less like a pizza crust and more like focaccia bread.  I have included pictures of the actual pizza we received - the first shows the small pile of toppings I scraped off the ""crust"". Our bill for this meal was $50 including tip.  We both felt robbed.  I rarely leave any restaurant actually angry but that is exactly the way I left this restaurant.   Maybe they do a good happy hour (though their appetizers aren't great), or maybe they are a good place to watch a football game, but they are not a good place to spend your money if you actually care about the quality of the food you eat.  Lexington has EXCELLENT pizza (see my review for Crust) and there isn't a single thing on the menu at BJ's that isn't done better in one of Lexington's local restaurants.  My advice:  don't waste your money here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
16,Shaun J.,"Richmond, KY",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-08,"I went there today and had an amazing young female as a server. I figured I would inform the management of what a great job she had done. I asked her to get the manager so I could speak with that individual and was met by LeAnn, this is where everything went downhill. She was rude, unprofessional, her appearance was very unkept and honestly felt like she had better things to do than to talk to guests. The food, beer and service were great but the manager left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended)  I have worked in the restaurant business for many years as a manager and have never been so embarrassed for the staff than I am right now knowing she is in management. Overall it was a very good visit but I will not return if this is the individual they place in management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
35,Micah C.,"Richmond, KY",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-12,"Beyond disappointed with a recent visit. I dined in over the weekend due to a Veterans Day special. Not only did the food take well over an hour but the servers seemed to get no help. Very rarely have i ever had the same server. Turn over rate would be my assumption. My girlfriend and I were very patient due to being in the service industry in the past. Appetizer took 25 minutes. I may not be a cook but a pepperoni flatbread shouldn't take that long. Frozen pizzas do not even take that long. I never asked for my server to get a manager or threaten for one, however one stopped by to ask how I was enjoying my food. Clearly she could tell there was some agitation, instead of going straight back to the kitchen to check on the meal, this woman marched up to my server and got after her for not knowing what was going on with my food. Never ever should you talk down to your employees, she was rude and demeaning. Another manager was sent to my table and left me her name, liz. Neither manager seemed to even be concerned even after my food was received. Both female managers who stopped by couldn't even look me in the eye and didn't seem to care. The food was sloppily made and it looked as if my girlfriends food had been cooked under the lamp. My server was not even the one that dropped the food off and even she was disgusted as to how it came out. I later found out that the other managers name was le Anne. I am beyond disgusted with how I was treated on Veterans Day. This was not just a day to make big sales. never will I set foot in this establishment until things change. My entire unit will be notified to not dine there as well as Toyota staff. I am beyond sorry for people working under both these disrespectful women. As well as people dining in, food quality was a disgrace. Management should be checking that. I'm posting this because how how disgraceful this place is. I actually hope something is done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

Service was great. Pizza was amazing. And I had the chili cherry salmon. It was out of this world!  The wait for the food was a bit long but they were extremely busy. Also try the cream soda, it's homemade and amazing. We bought a growler of it to go. You can buy growlers the the cream soda and their beers, which is nice for later.

2,Ken H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,19,1.0,1.0,2017-12-29,"I am very familiar with the BJ'S Restaurant chain and frequent it quite often. This was my first time at this location and most likely my last. We came in and ordered drinks and appetizers, and we're very disappointed to see that our Artichoke Hearts (who were served to by a food runner) were really really burnt. How and why would you even bring these to a table when they were literally  black?  We summoned our server Mallory (who was absolutely fantastic) to return these to the kitchen for some new ones. Mallory agreed and ordered us some new ones.  The artichoke's they sent us were now RAW and GREASY, and again why would you send out raw and greasy food?  I asked to speak with the Manager who took her time but finally made it to the table and introduced herself. She asked what the problem was and I explained the issues with her. She said that she saw the first batch of artichoke hearts and agreed that they were unacceptable, I then told her that this almost seemed to be retaliatory to us because nobody could be off that far off on just a simple deep fried appetizer. She disagreed and said that it was not possible because it is not our policy not to be retaliatory. I then tried to explain that deep fried appetizers are a very simple item to make with minimal effort needed to prepare them that is why I thought this may have been retaliatory for sending back the first ones. She again proceeded to say that this was not possible due to their policy. So I asked if it is policy to cook and send out food that is burnt or raw? Finally her reply was ""that people make mistakes"" Exactly!!! Then own it and don't argue with your customers! Just tell them that you apologize and that you will look into the issue, nothing more nothing less, please do not try to make excuses for the problems that come out of the kitchen saying that they are impossible just because you have a policy. Good managers Fix problems, they don't make excuses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2,3.28,2.86,2.86,,3.028
1,CT S.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,1.0,2018-01-01,"Oh BJ's, its just not meant to be. And its definitely not me, its you Bj's, its all you. So my wife and I tried BJs again after a less than stellar visit in November for her 50th birthday. Slow service, cold cheese curds, inedible salad, mediocre and underseasoned prime rib and snail-paced service.  We decided to give this spot another chance after the general manager called after I left an initial review. I had really high hopes after I spoke with   Lee Ann.  She was apologetic and understood the concerns and promised to address them with the staff. We were sent a $50 gift card to try BJs again. So we did today and we've just come to the conclusion that BJs is just not a place we will return to.  Some of the same issues on this visit.  Slow service from start to finish in the middle of the day when it was not even close to being full. Our server, who's name we never got and they don't wear name tags, was pleasant enough. But the length of time between getting drinks, getting appetizers, getting salads and getting our entrees was a bit much.   Again we ordered the cheese curds again because they are delicious.  I can only imagine how good they are when they are actually piping hot. I can only attest to what they taste like when they hover between lukewarm and room temperature.  I got a garden salad and my wife got a caesar. Her's was so wilted and was room temp at best. She said it looked like it had been sitting somewhere for hours. My salad was adequate. Their blue cheese dressing is GROSS but the salad was at least vibrant and didn't seem to be old. We both ordered the sirloin, she had the mashed potatoes which were good but dry.  I too ordered the sirloin but the waiter heard ""ribeye"". I also ordered the mac and cheese couscous. I would not advise ordering that unless you really really like cheese. It was alot of cheese with some couscous. It was very, very orange. My steak was kind of fatty and was absent of any sort of seasoning.  A true disappointment. Even the au jus and horseradish I asked for was bland. The staff have always been pleasant and nice.  But the quality of food and the slow service makes BJs a place we are highly unlikely to patron again. Its not a place I would recommend to anyone either. There are many, many, many places, without comically large menus, that serve high quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lexington-2,3.28,2.83,2.83,,3.01
