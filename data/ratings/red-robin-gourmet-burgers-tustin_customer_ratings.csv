148,Wayne C.,"Lake Forest, CA",31,84,12.0,4.0,2012-07-07,"This Red Robin location officially opens on 7/9. The restaurant occupies what used to be the Marmalade Cafe. I visited this Red Robin location during their soft opening. After a friendly conversation with a manager, this Red Robin replaces the Tustin Marketplace location. Some complications with the lease between the old location and the Irvine Company arose, so Red Robin moved into The District, which is not under the control of the Irvine Company. The employees transferred with the move. The food of Red Robin is always consistent, service is always great, and my experiences always pleasant. If some sort of problem does occur, the staff tends to be excellent problem solvers. Red Robin also offers a happy hour from 3p - 8p, Monday through Friday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=140,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006
175,ESTHER L.,"Irvine, CA",69,7,2.0,4.0,2012-07-07,"Went here for dinner yesterday, and despite being newly opened, this location was very nice. We were greeted with a smile as soon as we arrived and everyone was incredibly friendly. When we were seated we only had to wait a minute or so for our server to come by and take our drink and food orders. The food came out promptly and all the food tasted good. I didn't get what I normally got, I decided to try something new. It wasn't too bad, but I think I'll stick to my normal order.  Towards the end of the meal our Freckled Lemonade was starting to become more and more yellow, and less red...maybe they forgot to put the syrup in? Regardless, it was good. When I'm in the area, I'll definitely come back to this one..everyone is just so nice and friendly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=160,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005
155,Harry P.,"Albany, CA",179,156,330.0,4.0,2012-07-09,"I was told the Red Robin at this location was opening on 7/9 so I took a little bit of time to come visit. But other yelpers beat me to the punch. Oh well, its not like it really matters does it? I'm guessing since its opening day, they have all or most of their staff on hand so everyone can get hours and proper training before they start handing out hours before, and accommodate the crowd, if and when there is a crowd due to opening day. There was someone who opened the door for us (again I'm guessing this isn't what she was hired for) and we were greeted by I could say 6 hostess. We were promptly seated as there wasn't a crowd (we went in around 4/5ish right before dinner) and our waiter approached us quickly and asked us for drinks. We ended up ordering: Prime Chophouse  And the Customized Red's Tavern Double Crybaby spicy With bottomless fries of course Water was refilled promptly some of the time, the other times the waitress asked if we wanted more water, not too bad, at least she acknowledges that we would like more water as opposed to other places. Burgers were pretty prompt, except for the fact they took like maybe 2 minutes to do a restaurant wide meeting, could of have my burger sooner but why should I rate them down to the death if its just 2 minuets? (some people really really **** like that) To the burger, I haven't had a burger in a long time so this might be that talking but it wasn't too bad, was juicy, and it had almost everything I wanted. My cousin's burger wasn't spicy at all which could be an indicator they need to possibly change the name. There was a funny flavor in my burger that I couldn't pick out but I liked it. It was an enjoyable experience and the fries, although we had to ask was fried really well. They were pippin hot when we got them and that's always a plus. Sauce accommodations is really well done, ask and you shall receive... for most sauces you can think of and it's not an extra charge like some places... (I'm talking about you wing stop, dominos, pizza hut, and all the McDonalds that insist on charging 25 cents for ""Extra"" sauces). I know we didn't order much, and ill definitely be back to try other burgers. Our bill came out to be just over 22 dollars with tip, not too bad. As we left, there were more patrons coming in and there it was again, 4 people standing in the lobby giving farewells greetings, and the door operator too. :D Why 4 stars then? I don't know, the food just didn't seem to WOW me, just made me go, hmm... not bad. Regardless if they keep up the service, cleanliness, and the food quality goes up, the only way the star rating is to go up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=140,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005

When I got the invite email for their grand opening, I was over joyed! This location should be better for them and with ample parking, what reason is there for Not going??? - great burgers (and even new ones) - customize their burgers or even make your own - great thick steak fries (must be a new fryer cuz they were amazing!) - endless fries (server kept coming w baskets, as if he had a psychic link w my stomach) - shakes (that you can mix, so go ahead ... ask for a chocolate-banana shake) - quick service (our food was out in less than 10 min) - exactly what we ordered ( no mistakes, no waiting for replacement) Yes ... there are two other burger joints within walking distance ... but with all you get, IMHO ...

274,Esther C.,"Irvine, CA",718,152,304.0,3.0,2012-07-20,"Why the 3 stars? Well basically, a coworker and I decided to beat the lunch rush and go to lunch at 11am since we only had an hour for lunch. Parking was a breeze and we were seated promptly. We made sure to order quickly so that the food could come out that much quicker. After 30 minutes of waiting (in a nearly empty restaurant), we asked our server to check up on our order. She responded that they had a lot of phone orders that needed to be taken care of but assured us that ours would come out soon. Our food came out 40 minutes after we ordered it .. and 5 minutes AFTER the table next to us got their food (although they came in 15 minutes after us). At this point, I think I was just annoyed because we both got the sandwich and soup combo which shouldn't take 40 minutes to make. I know that servers should treat all customers equally but I think it's pretty clear to see that some customers are more pressed for time (aka those in business casual clothes) than those that are there with their family and friends. I enjoyed the food as much as I could since we were already running late at this point. When we were ready for our check, our server was nowhere to be found and we literally had to stand up and walk around to ask someone for our check. I'm not expecting to come and go within 40 minutes in a sit down restaurant but waiting 40 minutes for a sandwich and soup at 11am was just a little too ridiculous for my liking. I am sure I will return here eventually but will definitely NOT be trying to stop by during my lunch hour .. unless I place a phone order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=260,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004
149,M L.,"Irvine, CA",379,413,196.0,4.0,2012-07-24,"I never really liked Red Robin. I think the burgers are overpriced and the meat tastes microwaved. Yeah, they have bottomless fries but their fries are soggy and gross. The RR seasoning is also pretty overrated. Came here during our lunch break at work. I got the Tavern double, cry baby style. I had never seen this before at a Red Robin, and not sure if this is exclusive only to this location since I hear it's a franchise. Cry baby style means that it comes with crispy onions, some onions grilled in sriracha, and some spicy ketchup. I was pretty impressed by this burger! The patties were actually decent and tasted like they made them, rather than rip open a bag of frozen ones. The title is misleading though, it is incredibly mild. But I still enjoyed it. I prefer flavor over burn. Our server was pretty awesome too. This was one of the few times I've gone to a restaurant and they didn't have to ask who ordered what. She also didn't take forever for our extra fries, water, sauce, or whatever we needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=140,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005

Although, they do need more parking spots because they are competing with every other place in The District. Expect it to be crowded Friday evenings.  I ordered the Prime Chophouse.. meh. It was ok. It wasn't that great either. The fried onion bits were soggy and weren't holding together. I noticed that it was a different bun, but it tasted no different. The meat was ok and so were the mushrooms. The service was pretty good. They definitely hired A LOT of people.

265,Greg P.,"Irvine, CA",1,11,,2.0,2012-07-27,"I went because my kids ate free and thought I would try it anyways.  The burger was average at best - the patty was overcooked and quite small.  For $10, I would have expected a restaurant style burger - at least 1/2 a pound.  It was about the size of a quarter-pounder.  The lettuce seemed dried out and overall not impressive.  I give it two stars because the steak fries were good, and you can get refills on them.  When I left, I looked to my right and saw Five Guys burgers and to my left was In-n-Out.  It then hit me, this place would finish 3rd everytime in that race.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=260,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003
260,Michelle F.,"Nashville, TN",6,23,3.0,2.0,2012-07-27,"I am confused about how this place has such good ratings. My boyfriend and I were cranky-hungry and near The District.  He described the quality of Red Robin as being on par with Chili's or something like that which sounded good enough for how hungry I was feeling.  He got the gourmet cheeseburger and said the actual meat was good but the sauce and other toppings were meh.  I had the veggie burger.  The description mentioned seasoned zucchini, grilled onions, and a balsamic sauce atop the burger (moringstar) which sounded kind of delicious. The actual burger was topped with three hot, tasteless, steaming zucchini spears and the balsamic sauce just tasted tangy.  Additionally, just because the fries are thick doesn't mean they are good.  I'm pretty easy going with food and this was hands down one of the worst meals I've had in a while. So if you find yourself at The District...

I like their fries as well, but I have noticed if I put more of the seasoning on them, it tastes like cleaner.  No, I dont like cleaners usually, but you know, when you associate tastes with the way something smells.   ANYWAY, I was happy with my visit to this Red Robin, minus the mass hysteria of the parking lot... but its always been like that, so its not due to just Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=100,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184
277,Think L.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,2012-08-11,Dispointed at the service it sucked went their at happy hour tonight. 1st of all I never had bad service at a Red Robin until today.

252,Walter M.,"Oceanside, CA",1865,1608,606.0,4.0,2012-08-13,"For the longest time I always associated Red Robin with Round Table Pizza. Red Robin-Round Robin-Round Table. Most of this was because the nearest location was 20+ miles from me and ate there so rarely. I always see the commercials and feel out of the loop on the RR culture with the whole ""yum"" hum but frankly either ignored or didn't see that for years the way they make us feel we all should. Initially I thought the chain to be somewhat like ""chilli's"" with their  ribs association I too figured the burgers here would be amazing, but as we all know Chilli's ribs are not the business and Red Robin burgers just can't compete with the 2011 Burger revolution. It's as if the whole world became burger connoisseurs overnight. No longer will mediocre ingredients be acceptable as by now most everyone has had an excellent burger that blew away years and even decades of old cooking thinking. That may seem harsh, but when you look at the rest of the menu here it's actually quite good. For a chain restaurant they have very consistent and good sides, entrees and appetizers, obviously there is no executive chef making everything from scratch, and they do manage to step away from the whole ""waiting"" cloak as they are somewhat kid friendly, yet they are able to keep the rif raf boozers apart from any innocent bystanders by sheer architecture and layout unlike other places. It's a large location that's clean and new. Service is usually impeccable at all locations and my first few times here they lived up to the billet, but my last experience was sub par. Just slow, I mean I'll give them that they get packed because The District can be a pile sometimes and parking can suck a bit, but over 2 hours during HH I waited half the time for drinks and ended up moving to Dubliner and then to sushi for dinner. I actually would have loved to stay and eat there and the reason we left Dubliner was it was too bar foodish. If your thinking of eating and a Chilli's or Applebee's, try Red Robin first. If your looking for a good burger, look elsewhere because the flavor profiles are great here, but it's a new era and burgers and food in general. Red Robin is to burgers what Shock Top is to beer, better than domestic coors, but not craft enough to hang with a micro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=240,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

Their regular-priced drinks are already pretty reasonable ($4.29 for a dirty martini, for example); during happy hour, a vodka & soda is only $2.50 -- what a deal!! As a precursor to our burgers, we found the 3-For-All (with 4 dipping sauces), the Zucchini Sticks, and the Fresh-Fried Mushrooms (under the appetizer menu) tasty!

It was noisy and quite distracting, however, it was a booth so there's at least that...  Our server took a full ten minutes before actually coming to the table to say hello and ask us for our drink orders.  By that time, we decided to order our drinks, appetizers, and dinner.  We got our items in the following order: Food, Drinks, Appetizers, Forks, napkins, then applicable sauces (Ketchup & Ranch).  I think there might be a disconnect between this location's POS system and their kitchen...  I mean, really, by the time our appetizer came, my husband and I were finished with dinner... By that time, we wanted to have the appetizer cancelled; but she was so inattentive that she left the table without a word!   Another note on our server, she was so quiet that my hubby and I could barely hear her... I can accept that, but I will not accept that fact that she was very inattentive to our section.  The fact that I had to ask for condiments, utensils, napkins, water, AND OUR FOOD. Lastly, the food was really lacking here... When our food finally came out, my husband's bacon burger had one piece of bacon.... And my burger's meat was so well done that it was borderline chewy....

I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich (hold the pickles and the bacon, substituted the chicken for a vegan patty, and had a wheat bun instead) and, even though the sandwich was sort of messy to eat, it was still very delicious and satisfying.

First of all, I think that every restaurant should provide the highest, freshest quality in ALL of their foods prepared. There is no reason that one menu item should be ""better"" than another one. Every menu item should be cooked and handled with 100% care and attention to achieve customer satisfaction.  With that said, the Hummus & Vegetable Appetizer should have been ""up to par"", just as their ""gourmet burgers.""  Why should this dish have LESS FRESH ingredients, or ""LESS QUALITY"" vegetables?  The ""grilled zucchini"" that you see in my photo, looks like it came fresh off the grill.. NOT!!! These zucchinis were COLD!!! It's as if they grilled it HOURS before and just left it sitting out in the cold... You know, you could at least reheat it!! (even if it's not fresh... just to make it better for the customer to eat...)  The ""baby carrots"" were NOT WASHED!!!!  The jicama was good.  The hummus, not bad.. I actually liked the bits of garlic on top..  Some of you who are reading this review, might be thinking, ""why does your rating reflect a 'non-burger' item?""   Well, like I explained earlier, just because the restaurant doesn't specialize in a certain menu item, doesn't give them the permission to serve ""poorer quality"" food???

Our visit started with a grumpy gentleman.  He was not pleased to see us, nor did it look like he wanted to be serving us at all.  We all ordered our food and waited.  Upon the arrival of the food, it became apparent that my boyfriends burger was missing.  The food runner went to go see where it was.  Our server came by halfway during our meal and also went to go see what was happening with the burger.  Towards the end of our meal he said ""Okay, we tracked down the burger for you, should be out shortly.""  (We much would have preferred an honest ""I forgot to put it in"" or a ""Our kitchen skipped the ticket"" than some clearly BS excuse)  As we finished our meal, the server walked around the general area of our table, checking to see if the burger had arrived.  We were finished with our meals and had stacked plates near the edge of the table.  Still, no burger.  The server seemed to be too embarrassed to walk near our table, so every single cup on the table remained empty, begging for refills.  A busser came by to take our plates, mistakenly taking someones drink as just a dirty glass.  Finally a guy in our party had to track down the manager as we had finished a while ago, and were still waiting.  The manager was very nice and apologetic when the burger finally came out.  We then had to request from him everything we wanted (refills, a glass replacement, more food, etc) as our server still failed to show.  The one thing that saved the night was the manager's sincere apology and the fact that he took the final burger off our check.  We still tipped 20% off the original check price as we gave the server the benefit-of-the-doubt... maybe he was just having an off night?  Though 6/7 of us seriously doubted that, nevertheless 20% was given. The table's only pet peeve with the manager was that when he filled our glasses, he touched the rim of the pitchers to the rims of the glasses.  Contaminating other people's glasses (we do not all use straws) with mouth-germs from other strangers in the restaurant is a pretty serious offense - especially  with such a serious flu outbreak going around - and it seemed like a very careless mistake.

THE MOOD: Fun, friendly, and casual.  This Red Robins is located right in The District.  It's in a spacious location and easy to find. THE 'TUDE: The service here is what makes this place awesome!  We were promptly greeted with smily faces when we walked in.  As we had a party of 10+ people for this birthday meal, they made sure to keep us updated on the status of our table.  We only had to wait about 15 minutes tops on a Friday evening (awesome) before we got seated. Our waiter immediately greeted the portion of our party that had already arrived and offered fries for the table while we waited for the others to join us.  We were celebrating 4 birthdays that evening and our waiter couldn't have been any nicer.  Waters were consistently being refilled, our orders were brought our promptly, and he tended to our table's every little request.  Thanks for making our meal so enjoyable! THE FOOD: The food is okay.  My bf is in love with Red Robin burgers.  For me, the bread on the burgers always come out super soggy and the flavors just fall flat for me, but if the rest of my group and my bf are happy, then I am happy! OVERALL: I will probably find my way back here.  I like the location and the fact that there are great little shops that I can browse after my meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=120,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.0840000000000005,3.3200000000000003
166,Arnold K.,"La Mirada, CA",749,219,14.0,5.0,2013-09-09,"I already gave a 5 star review for this place.  I've never updated a review to write 5 stars again.  This is a first.   To qualify, I only give 5 stars if there is something exceptionally the best about that place... For example:  1) King Taco gets 5 stars for their amazing sauce & quality Mexican food 2) Rance's gets 5 stars for the best Chicago style pizza in the OC 3) Mario Peruvian gets 5 stars cause it's my favorite Peruvian restaurant Now, I'm writing 5 stars (again) for this Red Robin for this one singularity: GREAT SERVICE!!!  For every sit down restaurant of the Chili's, Red Robin, Denny's, Millie's variety... This by far is the best service I've ever come across.   FIRST, I gave a review of this newly opened Red Robin handling a group of 40+ of us.  They were amazing!   This time around I rolled in with like 5 people.  We were sitting next to the bar.  I was there to watch Sunday Night Football.  So, we were camping out for a while.  This guy Hugh, man... he got my drink order.  My drink never hit bottom.  I've never ever ever ever ever had this happen.  I drink like a camel.  Before I finished my drink, he'd come over with another drink.  He did this for 3+ hours.  I must've gotten 7-9 refills.  I wasn't even counting.  He kept refilling.   I didn't order food for like 30+ minutes.  I told him to ignore us while we were gaining an appetite, but he kept coming by to check if we were hungry.   When we got the check, they forgot to include my drink (which was like 7-9 refills of a drink).  We told Hugh & he said it was fine.  We gave him a nice tip of course for the service & to compensate for the drink.   And finally, usually after you pay your bill, you're not getting anymore refills, right?  Well, Hugh still kept coming by to check on us.  He kept refilling us or getting us water.  What the heck?  Hugh!  You are awesome!  Red Robins of the District: You guys are doing a great job!  I'm thoroughly impressed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=160,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.3480000000000003,3.3600000000000003

165,Shanna D.,"Irvine, CA",177,35,1.0,3.0,2013-09-24,"Sooooo this review comes with a caveat. I have recently (VERY recently) given up eating red meat so you may need to take my review with a grain of non burger blood sloshed salt but I will say I've eaten here multiple times previously, so I am a connoisseur of their burgers as well.  My husband has some kind of weird obsession with this place. When given the choice between Red Robin and ANYTHING else, he always goes for the big red cartoon bird. Sometimes I am just unable to fight off his desires so we end up in the plastic booths of this chain restaurant instead of sampling goat cheese and bacon infused dates or whatever else ridiculous food my refined (so says he) palate thinks is edible.  I don't think it's ever been crowded when we come here. The service is always good and efficient. I've never gotten the stink eye from a server or someone too rushed to pay us any attention. They are all very nice. The food is what you would expect from a chain that specializes in ""gourmet burgers."" I must say as a memo to the marketing department at RR, they should try GDBRO Food Truck burgers and then try telling me again that these things are ""gourmet."" Ha! But the ingredients are always fairly tasty, especially the Bleu Ribbon Burger and the Whiskey River BBQ Burger.  Where they lose the stars is in their chicken. It became pretty obvious to me that their chicken is precooked and then reheated  when one day I ordered a salad that came with a full chicken breast and not only was it pretty dry but when I lifted it slightly from the plate, the painted on grill marks ceased to show. It also had an ""almost chicken"" texture. I got the Whisky River BBQ Chicken Wrap as well and ran into the same weird not quite chicken but is really straining itself texture.  I wouldn't advise anyone to stay away from here but if, like me, you've decided to cut back on the red meat, I would suggest another option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=160,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.0200000000000005,3.4400000000000004

170,Tasheena B.,"Anaheim, CA",30,96,66.0,2.0,2013-11-04,"This review is purely for my one experience at this location. I came here with a group of 6 total for lunch on a Tuesday.  We were promptly seated at a large booth and greeted by our server who was very nice and polite.  We ordered 2 appetizers, the Onion Ring Tower and Spinach Dip along with our drinks.  Our drinks and appetizers were brought out pretty quickly and our server took our meal orders.  I ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger, a few of my co-workers order the Royal Robbin, and then the others ordered a chicken sandwich and a regular cheeseburger.  All the food was brought out about 10 minutes later, and our server asked if we needed any condiments.  I asked for ranch, and she quickly brought out 5-6 small ramekins of ranch and then she left and we didn't see her again for at least 15-20 minutes.  In the meantime, my co-worker is eating a burger with a fried egg on it and the yolk form the egg is just oozing out everywhere all over their hands and we have no extra napkins to be found anywhere!  Finally, my co-worker simply got up and went to the restroom to wash their hands because it was so messy!  I once was a server and more napkins is an obvious need with messy food.  Its like serving ribs and handing the patron 1 tiny napkin, it's just common sense.  Other than that mishap the service was fine.  She eventually came back and took our plates and offered dessert, etc. Now for the food, not one of us had fires that weren't overcooked or stale tasting.  The fries were almost hollow they were so well done.  Needless to say a few of us were pretty disappointed, and we couldn't ask for more fries due to our server being missing. Guacamole Bacon Burger: Bland, bland, bland!  Not a sing taste stood out.  The serving amount of guacamole is pretty dismal.  I get more from the Carl's Jr. version of the burger.  The meat had not taste and the cheese was just kind of melted.  Not their best burger, by far! Onion Rings: These were ok, they aren't beer battered so its a little rough on the roof of your mouth.  Dipping sauces that accompany it are pretty tasty. Spinach Dip: Your average spinach dip, kind of bland as well, nothing to write home about.  Mud Pie:  Not sure of the exact name but this thing is ridiculously huge and super frozen when you get it.  I'm not even sure how they cut it, its SOLID when you get it.  If you're a choco-holic then you'll love it. Pros: Friendly Staff Plenty of Seating Good for Large Groups Plenty of menu choices Cons: Guacamole has no taste Burger is not seasoned at all Fries Overcooked No ""2-minute check back"" done by server Very limited dessert choices",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=160,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7600000000000007,3.2800000000000002

But now, this time I have felt RR's redemption in becoming better than it was before, and I have returned to make amends. I wasn't disappointed. The Tustin District location is fairly new, and has a great atmosphere. Very clean, and staff is accommodating. Although, we had waited for our food due to a computer delay in ordering, both the server and manager gave me their most sincere apologies and discounted the order. Ok, kudos for sure. Perks: New vivacious menu to explore. New Bar Drinks and Libations are extremely inviting. Their Mango Margarita is smooth and very chill. Mini appetizer versions are adorable. The Mini Onion Ring Tower is a Must starter. Awesome TIP: The Royal Red Robin Burger is uber super delish!! A must try if you are a supremo burger lover.

164,Phil D.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,44,,1.0,2013-11-15,"My wife and I love red robin, we usually go to the one near us and its great but were in the area by this one as we had to drive to LAX to collect family.  We arrived just after 6.00 p.m. on a Thursday evening the greeting at the door was subdued, patio looked nice but server to work it was hard to find so changed to inside. Then we had to wait 5-10 minuted to be seated, no one else there waiting but they told us tables were waiting to be cleared, ummm I could see four tables sitting empty and clear. When they did take us to a table it was one of the ones I saw already cleared, funny that. Okay it looked a bit rushed in there and staff was visibly thin although I did see supervisors standing around chatting.  Our server arrived but had at least three tables (including us waiting to be served) so she went to each table taking orders, which meant everyone had to wait for her to cover all of the tables before there orders were put in. I must point out the server (Lauren) was very nice and I just felt she was under a lot of pressure).  Eventually the food cam but we also had a bit of a wait here. I had the royal red robin and my wife the fish & chips. The burger was nice and well presented, the fires were tepid and very limp/soggy, our server had vanished and I was starving so I ate them. My wife batter on the fish was also soggy and the fries the same as mine. Now remember I got the royal red robin which has a fried egg in it and my wife the fish & chips so you generally are going to get your hands messy, no extra napkins, the server did appear halfway through and got us some so she made up points here. After finishing my meal and asked for another serving of fries thinking these ones will be better, nope not at all, in fact you would think they were some of the first batch, barely warm and limp/soggy. Now I could mention it but to be honest we were on a schedule here so did not want to cause more delays. We both gave up on the fires and she did on the batter just removing it to eat the fish. All the staff seemed to be rushing around at a fast pace but I again saw supervisors wandering aimlessly and not helping out, in fact there were kids running around screaming and no one said a word to them. Okay after the messy burger I needed to clean my hands so I headed for the restroom, oh tight space between tables en route, a male server comes and instead of being polite and allowing you to pass first, oh no he just barges through, nothing in his hands. Then when I leave the restroom same thing again with the same server, wow sorry I forgot I was paying to be here. We gave up, paid the bill and left, no one thanked us for both paying or even visiting the restaurant I really got the feeling I was doing them a favor by leaving. Will not visit this location again thank you will got to my local on at Foothill Ranch, CA there you get good service, great food and the managers even come over to talk to you and bring the food out. Leadership starts from the top and I feel this was severely lacking. Wow I paid for this experience thank you red robin at the district for making me feel like I had just gone to MacDonalds. I want to add I hate writing a bad review but when this happens sometimes this is the only was to make then see the problem and correct it plus for others to be warned. If the experience is good I always point it out to the server or staff, we must go both ways on these things.

83,Denise K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",690,409,537.0,3.0,2013-11-19,"For the price, I think I could actually get a much better burger somewhere else but Red Robin's does offer convenience since most of their locations are at malls. The food is actually pretty good but definitely not gourmet or something I would rave about to friends. They have a lot of options so you don't have to get a burger. Most meals are at least ten dollars. You can definitely get your moneys worth with baskets of their bottomless fries. The boyfriend and I usually share an entree and get stuffed with more fries. Not the healthiest option LOL but definitely cost effective. The red robin seasoning makes the bottomless fries deelish! We tend to stick to the chicken sandwiches or wraps to be a little healthier and I personally think they are better than the burgers. We like the whiskey river bbg chicken sandwich/wrap or the bruschetta chicken sandwich. There are also great vegetarian options for the non-meat eaters! Their late night happy hour starts at 8pm which is earlier than most places, so the boyfriend and I like to come here when we missed the earlier happy hour but don't want to wait til late night. We're old now and need our rest. :( However, their happy hour offerings are much more limited than most other restaurants. Only a few drinks are discounted. Thankfully, I don't mind sticking to their margaritas which are included in happy hour. You can only get happy hour at the bar or in the patio.

Upon ordered , I was informed that the fried zucchini appetizer was completely vegan-friendly. NOPE! It has mozzarella cheese inside. I told our server, and she brought us out a freshly made new one as well as a refill on all of our appetizers. The boss man came out and asked us if we were happy now and if there was anything he could do for us. Everything was fine, and after that incident, the servers were all super attentive and filled up our drinks everytime they passed by. When the bill came around, the price was greatly reduced thanks to them taking their mess-up off the final check. So basically, we got a free appetizer.

That's not a bad thing however, I would say that compared to my other Red Robin experiences this was probably my least satisfying visit.  One thing I would like to highlight from my visit was my server. She was extremely friendly, very professional and she pretty much garnered the extra star, otherwise I would have rated this Red Robin 2 stars.  My biggest complaint about this particular Red Robin is that the food was really sub-par. I ordered the chili chili burger, which was described to be an extremely messy but delicious burger. However, what I got instead was a small cheeseburger with literally a spoonful of chili  on my burger patty. Simply put, it was extremely disappointing to pay up to $10 for a ""gourmet"" burger that tasted like a regular cheeseburger with chili that tasted like it was from a can.  However, that's not all. My girlfriend ordered the prime house burger with a boca patty substitution. Although I thought her burger was pretty good she complained that parts of her burger was dry. Also we ordered chips with salsa and guacamole, but what we got instead was a handful of chips and a spoonful of guacamole and salsa.   The common problem here at this Red Robin is simple, the food is overly priced for such little portions. I can't say that I would visit this Red Robin again since there are so many other burger chains nearby such as Islands, In n Out, and 5 guys that offer better burgers for better prices.

Once our food came we devoured our plates. Before we were done our waiter brought the check by and we paid since we were in a hurry to not be too late back to work. My mom was finishing her soup and made an ugly face. I asked if she was ok and she spit something out. Then she said it was hard and couldn't chew. She picked it up and examined a HARD PIECE OF PLASTIC in her French onion soup.  We reported it to the waiter who said she would get the Manager. Another 10 mins later he came back and funded my mothers food.  We were both 30 mins late back to work and I don't think my mom will ever go back to a Red Robin or eat French onion soup for a while.

THIS STUFF IS SO ADDICTIVE AND DELICIOUS. dare i say it's the best damn honey mustard i've ever had? hmm... it's sweet and has less of a distinct mustard taste.....so good, i drenched every fry and chicken tender in it.  also, like another reviewer mentioned, the service here is just fine, but it is a bit slow. we ordered 4 meals and they only gave us 1 small communal basket of bottomless fries, which i found to be odd. we had like 5 fries each and then we'd need a refill. however, since it was so slow, we were constantly waiting on refills. we were missing utensils and had to flag someone down for that. we needed sauces, had to get up and go looking for someone because nobody was coming by. took awhile to get our bill. for a saturday night, you'd think they'd be better staffed -- the place wasn't even busy. would probably come back just for the red robin seasoning on bottomless fries and honey mustard sauce, but wouldn't recommend coming hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=140,3.2,3.29,3.29,3.308,3.254

(Not assuming, just wondering - they were white and we are not). Or was it the size of the party? (We had 2, they had 5. Maybe she was counting on them giving her a bigger tip). Once service began, I ordered a side of mayo and campfire sauce. Server says, ""Well ... it's the same thing. Campfire sauce is just mayo mixed with barbecue sauce."" Uhmmm ... if I had wanted a list of ingredients, I would have asked. Is there a reason you're telling me this? So finally, food comes. It was fine. Realized I will not be coming back when I tried to wipe my fingers (oily from onion rings) and found we had been given no napkins. Later tried to spread mayo on my burger and saw we had never received any knives or forks either. That's okay, I'll just ask when they check on us. No one did. Had to use my fries to spread the mayo on the bun. In the future, I will just do Farmer Boys instead (which is not a sit-down restaurant). I go to Red Robin to be served a meal.

I say big portions of course because of the bottomless fries that come with every burger. :P Also the strawberry lemonade is bottomless as well and it's sooo good (probably because all of the sugar) My friends and I have come here a few times, the main reason being the fries are bottomless and those dipping sauces are amazing! My favorites have got to be the campfire sauce, the sweet & spicy ketchup, and the honey mustard/poppy seed sauce. Definitely remember to ask for sauces because they make the fries and the burger so much better!! The burgers here are okay, I wouldn't say anything too special. They are very large though! I can never finish a whole burger (probably because i'm stuffing my face with fries)! The meat here is okay, sometimes it can be dry. I love how they have a variety of burgers though; red robin has so many different toppings to choose from. Service here is okay, I wouldn't say it's superb or anything but the waiters and waitresses get the job done. They're not going to fill your fries or lemonade right away you usually have to ask.

Firstly, try ordering over the phone - if anyone ever picks up, that is. Secondly, other jerk customers need to stop parking in the spots labeled FOR CURBSIDE ONLY. Since this is The District and parking is atrocious, yeah the spots are always occupied. This leaves the option of parking in the nearby TO GO ONLY spots which serve the entire rest of the mall. (Because 2 spots is plenty? Nope.) And they're normally taken too. Good luck. If you park in the TO GO spots, they will never think to look for you there and will therefore never bring out your food. Two times in a row, I called that I was there, told them where I parked and they said it would be another 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, no one showed up. So I called again, hey, where's my food? They said they'd send the manager and to hold on. They proceeded to hang up on me. I watched the door for several minutes but no employee even glanced outside the door. Called again - told the same thing and then hung up on. What the heck? I was being totally polite because hey, mistakes happen, but being hung up on twice? Whatever, decided to walk in.

""Oh, he must be crazy then.""  I am not freaking blind and it's not that hard to check the only 4 spots available to pick up food. Is it rocket science? It must be. Right. The manager was standing there chatting with people. C'mon. WHY LIE TO A CUSTOMER? I am not blind. It would be better to say, ""we're just so busy"" or ""we apologize for sucking""  but LYING? Not impressed.  At previous visit I even told the person on the phone where I was parked but they never told the waitress who was left wandering. Point to her - she found me anyway and she deserves a raise.  Sadly this has happened several times now. Our meal was luke warm at best.

The fries are pretty stale, dry and just plain bleh. I ordered the bacon burger, which was ok, but reminiscent of getting a burger at mcdees or other fast food joint, not worth the price my bf got the crispy chicken tender, which was a battered and fried chicken breast.  Boy was that an interesting sandwich the batter just falls off and gives you a totally dripped and soaked in oil fried taste.... maybe red robin should just go fast casual and lower the price, since they're already lowering the bar on quality?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=100,3.8,3.42,3.42,2.44,3.572

The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because The service was kind of slow. I had to ask them to please refill my water.

140,Shawn M.,"Santa Ana, CA",66,59,81.0,2.0,2015-06-29,"So while walking around the District, my son wanted Red Robin (basically just wanted mac n cheese). We waited about 5 minutes to be seated...which is not bad at all. Then the hostess brings us to this 2 person table (mind you its me, my wife, and 3 yr. old son)The table was  barely enough space for 2, let alone, 3! AND THERE WAS A BIG FAMILY RIGHT NEXT TO IT!! (basically it was a shared bench along the wall with these dinky tables)... So my wife asks if we could sit in one of the 2 booths that were open in the same area which were a better fit and more logical instead of cramming us in a tiny spot next to this huge family. So now we are in the booth and waiting for a server to come by...waiting....waiting....waiting....and finally he comes to finally offer us drinks, but about the time he got to us, we already looked over the menu several times and knew what we wanted. So then we put in our order, (kids mac n cheese w/oranges, Caesar salad, clam chowder soup,a short bbq boneless wings, 2 freckled lemonades, and a kids apple juice) and it took them nearly 40 mins to bring us our order out! I mean, come on! Mac n cheese which was like watered down cheese, Caesar salad...which was basically 2 sticks of lettuce, and you got to be kidding me about the clam chowder! Literally 5 scoops with a spoon and it was finished! They placed the soup in this small THICK bowl but for the price...It may be a little on the high side! And now the boneless bbq wings...which came out WITH BONE! So to tell me after the 36 minute wait....I have to wait some more?! So 6 min later they bring out my boneless wings which was extra extra battered and fried (made it really crunchy and unappetizing), and not even a (sorry for getting your order wrong, or a let me add some extra fries for free)or(would you like a free dessert for the long wait that should have only been a Five minute wait, 10 minutes to be extra generous) but no, just a ""sorry for that""...So a recap, I am upset about the Price to ratio of food you are paying for, I am upset of the lack of customer service that my family and I received and also what I noticed of other servers serving other customers, and with that being said....I still like the royal burger! lol  My advice to the servers there...(not all)....it's not just the table you are assigned to that watches you. So keep that happy attitude always, specially when working in a customer service atmosphere. And if the wait is long, as long as you make the guest feel welcomed, other than just another table to wait on. Make the guest at easy by reassuring them that food will be coming out or just the check ups will make them feel like they are not forgotten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=140,3.4,3.34,3.34,2.248,3.3640000000000003

The bartender was really nice and changed the channel to the football game.  I mean, what could be better, sitting at home watching the game or sitting in Red Robins watching the game and eating fries? So why the 1 star review from the previous 2 star review?  I guess the hostess really taught me a lesson on where my ""kind"" belong.  The real host was a younger kid in a red robin black polo shirt.  But there was this older lady (not dressed in any red robin attire) and it's obvious that she was the manager of the place and was the big helper in the host area. I asked for crayons to keep my 18 month daughter occupied until the food came and she told me that they longer give crayons nor do they have them in stock.  Instead, take this dirty chalkboard, eraser, and a small piece of chalk and have your daughter played with it. Well, the small piece of chalk is a choking hazard!  Do you understand that?  I figured they were trying to be eco-friendly or something so I put it back. Then this Caucasian couple came in after us 10 minutes later and they had 5 kids in their party.  Before the kids came in, they rolled out the red carpet for them and gave each kid seat some crayons and coloring sheet before the kids were seated.  Their initial order was also 7 glasses of waters so it wasn't a money thing. WTF?  Not sure what was going on but I will go elsewhere for my drinks (not water) and dinner due to this poor judgement on their part.  Thanks for not seating me next to the door, bathrooms, or kitchen on this visit so you get 1 star for that. As I was leaving, I saw in the host area, plenty of crayons and coloring sheets.  Fed Ex must have delivered at 730pm just after I was seated because racism is unheard of these days and you cannot accuse a racist of being racist because it's not PC.  Let's make excuses for them; Monday was a soft re-opening, staff not properly trained, unaware of items in host area, etc. NEVER AGAIN, WILL I VISIT ANOTHER RED ROBIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tustin?start=80,2.96,3.3,3.3,2.308,3.164

I gathered my family from the four corners of SoCal to come here for my mom's birthday. We drove hella far (from the other side if the IE and LA) to go here. We asked the birthday girl where she wanted to go. After going through a very long list, we decided on this Red Robin because of the location and the patio.  I called in Friday evening to give tgem the head's up that we were bringing in a big group and we wanted to sit on the patio. The girl took our info and she said I should call back Saturday about 3. I called at 3:45 and the girl I spoke with confirmed my info and said we were good. So we get here well before 6 and tell the girl our name and party size. The girl is confused.

2,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",94,1431,2127.0,2.0,2016-01-12,"Red Robin can work in a pinch, I... guess?  You know the scene: sticky menus, screaming suburban children with their jaded parents and 20-something patrons clamoring for their free birthday Burger. Tustin's Red Robin is no different than yours and that is down to the American flag made out of baseballs. The options will not surprise you, but you can get lost in the sheer volume of different offerings (I counted 3 unique Bleu Cheese Burgers alone). The service is pedestrian and the prices border ludicrous (upwards of $15.00 these days).  One huge gripe I have is with the meat temperature choices. You have two: some pink or grey. That is really dumbing it down for your kitchen. If you can't count on your cook to figure out medium rare why did you hire the person to begin with? On to the Burger... I went with ""The finest Black & Bleu Burger"" (sans mushrooms) that is billed as ""A true knife-and-fork burger"" that they serve without... you guessed it... a fork. Or a knife.  A half pound Black Angus patty is dusted with blackening seasoning and then seared to ""some pink"" then topped with caramelized onions, a tangy Bleu cheese sauce and huge Bleu cheese chunks then given the wilted lettuce and toasted and sponge -like ciabatta bun treatment along with Dijon sauce. The Burger was ""somewhat juicy"" instead of ""some pink"" although the Bleu Cheese to blackening seasoning ratio really was spot on. Red Robin suggests eating the Burger with a Sam Adams. I would recommend the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA instead.  The Fries are greasy on the outside, dry and starchy within... but hey, you get all you can eat.  One Burger, Fries and the aforementioned Sculpin IPA will set you back about $30.00 after tax and tip. At that cost, I can't justify 3 stars even if they would cook it to order.

We tell our waiter and he just looks at us weird. 15 minutes later they take the food away and apologize. 25 minutes later no food. After that the manager says he will give us fries while we wait. 45 minutes later we are late for the movie and we still don't get our food.

After arriving there, I was told that the order was not ready and one of the items I ordered was not available. I told them why didn't they call and notify me. They told me that the number I called to place the order with was a third party and not on location. So basically they were not responsible. I asked them why isn't my food ready? They said that they were waiting for me to call so that I can order a different item to replace the one item they were out at the time. The item we are talking about was doughnuts and had nothing to do with them not preparing the two other entrees I ordered.  So basically my order was not ready, took an hours vs the 30 minutes I was promised. I took the food and come to find they also messed up on the order. I asked for fries but they gave  me something else.  My wife and I had a meeting that night and wanted to eat before the meeting. We ended up waiting until the meeting was over three hours later and the food was already cold.  We ended up throwing it away.  I asked to speak to the store manager and explained to him the situation when I was there. He said the same thing that the number we called to place the order with was not on location and that it was a thirds party and all he can say was sorry.  I am very disappointed and feel like I have been cheated and ripped off by this restaurant. Not only they messed up on my order, they also made me wit 30 extra minutes and when I finally opened the bags, the order was wrong.  What upset me the most is we tried to explain to the manager what had happened and instead of him offering us a refund, he instead pointed fingers blaming the ordering department that they messed up. I told him what about the delay of 30 minutes which made us late to our meeting. His response was and I quote, "" I'm sorry but we are so packed as you see and mistakes do happen."" This is very upsetting to have a manager say something like this to us. Very bad customer service. We have a corporation and we usually take our employees to eat there all the time. Due to this incident we have decided to take our business somewhere else. One more important thing, I tried to call corporate and was given the run arounds. It's always voice mail and they never returned my call.  I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Save your money and  stay away from this place.

I attempted to place an online order and link my rewards account, however the system was down. I called in and asked if I placed my order online whether or not I would be able to still earn points for my purchase. A team member told me all I had to do is provide my phone number when picking up my order and I would be credited the points. Upon arriving for my order and providing my phone number, I was told that unfortunately  I was given incorrect information. I would have to void the online order,  and re-order.  I was told that the online order when voided, would not post to my account and would ""fall off"". In good faith I paid for the order again. I noticed about 2 days after my visit,  I was charged for 2 purchases instead of one. I called in to find out how I could be refunded for the additional charge. I was told I had to wait for a manager to reach out to corporate, because Red Robin's system reflected I had not actually been charged. I peovided detailed information i.e transaction number, date and etc to substantiate the fact I had been charged. I was repeatedly told over the many days I called to follow up I had not been charged. After much persistence, I was finally told I was charged and should be credited within the next 2 days.   I waited the 2 days,  no refund. This went on for about 2 plus weeks. I had to finally call my bank to file a dispute.  Foolish of me to return, after a friend of mine wanted to. Against my judgement I did, and the service was HORRIBLE!! I ordered online and arrived within the 12 minutes as advised. I waited  for more than 30 minutes. I finally arrived home and discovered all the toppings on my burger was gone. I was livid. I called corporate and was treated even worse. The representative repeatedly called me outside of my name. When I corrected him,  he still continued. He was nonchalant or unconcerned with the poor treatment I experienced. He promised he would ensure I received a follow up call from a general manager.  Lets just say, I never received a follow up call!

Plus, the idea of bottomless fries sounded amazing. We waited about 15 minutes on a Saturday night to be seated, which wasn't bad at all considering there's an Ulta across the street. Once we were seated, we decided to order a monster oreo milkshake to share ($4.99), and I went with the Sir Acha Tavern Double ($6.99) while my boyfriend went with the A1 Peppercorn ($11.49).  The food came out at a relatively normal speed for an American restaurant, and our burgers came before the shake. My burger was pretty meh-- didn't taste sriracha at all, and it pretty much tasted like a bland fast food burger. Please hit your meat with some more seasoning. Also, the buns for their burgers aren't toasted. WHYY? Toasted buns are a much better vehicle for transferring the food into your mouth and would have added another level of very needed texture. Was sad to say that my boyfriend's burger was also pretty bland even though it was listed in the gourmet section. Buns were also not toasted, which just confuses me. However, everything else was good! The steak fries were really crispy and good, which was a surprise since they are endless. We ended up getting each of our fries refilled twice although we were unable to finish the second round. The server was extremely nice, however, and let us take the leftovers home. The shake was also good although it does not allow unlimited refills. You get the normal size glass and a metal cup with some extra shake to refill your first glass with. Overall, the burgers were average but our experience was pretty good.
