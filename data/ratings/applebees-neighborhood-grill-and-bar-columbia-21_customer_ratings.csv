13,Lang L.,"Tustin, CA",58,6,3.0,1.0,2014-02-07,"The food was burned, don't go there. Service was awful, the whole place was empty but we had to wait for almost 5 min to get seated. No one know what is going on. No one know what they are doing, the Applebee's sign is broken, ""Bee's""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
14,JD G.,"Columbia, SC",0,1,,1.0,2014-03-16,"TERRIBLE!!! My first and last time to ever set foot in this place!!! We got seated right away but had to wait 15 minutes to get someone to serve though the place wasn't packed! Those 15 minutes gave us the chance to look around and horror of all horrors: the blinds looked like they have never been dusted off since it opened! the overhead lamp on our area was in the same condition, floor was nasty as well! We were about to walk out when the beer we ordered finally came and it was nasty! When our food finally arrived, our server {young lady whose name's Ern} had to ask us what else we needed: we didn't have FORK & KNIVES !!!  Please clean up your place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
15,Athena M.,"Columbia, SC",1,19,2.0,4.0,2014-05-03,Food was good but our service was sterling!!  I would even say that it was the best service we have had in a long time.  We will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
11,Carmen B.,"Chapin, SC",50,1,,1.0,2014-07-25,So hungry last night....what a disappointment!!! My oriental chicken salad one literally one cup of greens a few shredded pieces of maybe carrot and put together the little pieces of hard fried chicken was one and a half chicken finger!!!!!  Daughters mac n cheese with honey pepper chicken fingers was watery tasteless amd had three dry.small.chicken fingers.  The wedge salad with queso chicken? Pitiful. That was not a wedge that was a leaf of lettuce!!!  Save your hard earned money!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
8,L C.,"Blythewood, SC",0,9,,1.0,2015-08-22,"Do not EVER go here! We ordered online and went to the store to pick it up. It was to be ready at 9:46 pm. We got there and waited over 30 minutes for our food. Once we finally received our order it was incorrect! So back inside we went to wait to be acknowledged. Finally, after flagging down help someone emerged from the back with the rest of our order.  Had we left the parking lot and not checked our order and just assumed that a restaurant knew how to conduct business, we would have been all the way home before realizing their colossal mistake. Of course the food was cold and had to be reheated. Never again! The manager saw the dilemma and walked past us repeatedly. And to think, Applebees is opening another of these nightmares on Killian Road! Stay away in advance. This company obviously cannot get it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
9,Michelle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,17,1.0,1.0,2015-11-09,Ok first of all when reviews say bad things I usually take a chance and still go.. Well in this case.. It was a huge mistake!!! I will never ever set foot into this Applebee's or any other because of this one.. Horrible service! The food made me sick .. I had a Asian chicken salad and it made my stomach hurt and didn't go well.. Mind you I got the salad after about waiting 45 or more min for it. My family and I waited a long time and they have kids.. So it was like 9 pm and we were still waiting .. Smh only good thing that came out of it was that our food was discounted. Horrible experience horrible service.. Never ever again will we go here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
12,Minecrafter 3.,"Fort Stewart, GA",0,32,1.0,1.0,2016-03-30,"Me and some friends went to Applebee's one night, only to be met with an overflowing waiting area and a hour-long wait. When we finally got in there, it took 20 minutes for them to come and ask for what we wanted. We ordered our entrees and drinks, which also took half an hour to get. We put in our main order which takes an hour and a half for them to bring. Only for it to be low-quality. I got a steak with fries and a Diet Coke, only for the Coke to be flat, the steak to be tough and chewy, and the fries to be overly salted and soggy. My friend's meals didn't turn out any better either. Our waitress was extremely polite and nice, made sure to give an extra tip. Only thing was when she spilled my drink on me when she was giving us refills. She was really apologetic and offered some napkins to clean it up, which I could understand why she spilled it considering how busy it was in there. The waitress is the only reason why I'm giving any stars to this restaurant, other than the fact that you have to vote at least one star. Overall, service was outstanding, food wasn't the best, and the lines and wait times are horrific. Definitely recommend going to Ryan's across the street instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
7,S S.,"Columbia, SC",27,6,1.0,1.0,2016-10-12,"Dirty, the food did not taste fresh. I don't understand why this place is still in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,

4,Doug B.,"Nashville, TN",25,1,,1.0,2017-02-23,"Food was wrong,  worst cooked steak ever!  Terrible service all the way around!   5 people at our table,   Everyone's food was bad!   Poor,  poor service!!      Avoid at all cost!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
5,Becky W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",81,14,7.0,1.0,2017-03-17,"This place doesn't even deserve one star. How can a restaurant that's been in business so long not get what makes a restaurant successful... But I digress... We went here because I got a coupon through email for my birthday. Buy one entree get one free... It was expiring today so I drug my husband here against his will (cuz he knows how lame Applebees is) & sure enough, I should've listened... Right when we walked in the hostess was looking down scowling and rolling her eyes at something, didn't say anything to us and after a minute I said ""hey"", then she was like ""hey, I'll be right with you,"" with an attitude and I should've walked right out at that point but a really nice friendly hostess came walking up and chatting with our 4 year old and happily brought us to our table.. It took a while for our server to get our drinks and then he didn't even ask our kid what she wanted and forgot to bring her anything. We order our entrees with the coupon in mind and told the server about the coupon and asked if he wanted it, but he said no, he would take it at the end. (He also didn't know the menu and I asked a question and he told me something wrong and I had to show him where it said entrees came with 2 sides.. ) from there it took just under an hour to get our food including our antsy 4 year olds kids meal.. and when we asked about our food the server just blamed the kitchen...I don't think people care who's fault it is they just want a good experience & when that's not provided, why would anyone come back to that restaurant? So at this point I'm not even hungry anymore,  we just want to get the heck out of there.. we ask for boxes and our check, give him the coupon and we're waiting for 15 minutes, then I take the food and our little one to the car and we wait in the car for another 15 minutes for my husband to pay... It took so long because they wouldn't except the coupon because it wasn't for that address!!??!! They better be so happy I was already in the car! they said they had no affiliation with that Applebees.. really? And gave us some free appetizer coupons... which are completely useless considering I'm never going back... So please, do yourself a favor and stay far away if you want a decent dining experience... I don't write many reviews on here, but I feel responsible to save people from that kind of experience!  personal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
3,Weena H.,"Columbia, SC",50,2,,1.0,2017-12-03,Server Kim SUCKS IN SERVICE!  Pay attention to the tables you're assigned too.  You ignored our table for awhile and never gave us a second look. payback's a bitch I wish you the worst worst customers and tips ever.  I wish you receive the same SUCK ASS service you gave us whenever you go out to a restaurant or bar.  You should be ashamed to be in the service industry as a server you totally suck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
2,Jim B.,"Northbrook, IL",0,29,,1.0,2017-12-18,"I don't know why I came back.  It had been about 5 years since I have eaten here, and have no need to come back. The place was mostly empty on a Monday night, but it still took 10 minutes after I was seated for a server to stop by my table.  The table was sticky, the lettuce on the salad had spots where it was turning brown, and the food was SLOW.  There are plenty of other options in this strip, no need to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
0,Michele M.,"Acworth, GA",8,109,15.0,2.0,2017-12-20,"I will start off saying that the service was good and I have absolutely no complaints about it. My issue was the food, I ordered the 3 appetizers which were boneless chicken, chicken wontons and the shrimp (hot) not sure of actual name. My chicken was hard and cooked too long, the slaw that comes on the wontons was cold and my shrimp were hard and dried out. I was with a guest and I'm assuming my food had to sit under the light to wait for the other order. But wouldn't it have been better to wait to cook mine so that it wouldn't have to dry out under the light. The sauce that comes on the shrimp was no longer visible and the ranch dressing that I asked for with my wings were hot. It was not a good food experience and suggest that the cook be aware of the time and when food should be prepared especially if you are not busy at all. It was maybe 3 tables literally, there is no reason why my food should have been so horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
1,Cindy Y.,"Columbia, SC",1,19,5.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"I come to this apple bees all the time but today I tried to order something new (caprese mozzarella chicken) and DAAAMNNNNN. It tasted like the chef butt chugged some old ass balsamic glaze and then leaned forward at the waist with his trousers around his ankles and began to erratically and violently squirt some ""ASSamic sauce"" over the entre.  P.s. My friend said the whiskey bacon burger was good and the unlimited chicken tenders were mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-21,,,,,
