Collin G.,"Newport News, VA",78,15,,5.0,8/27/2017,We didn't end up getting pizza here but the food we got was very tasty and the atmosphere was nice. A lot of the other restaurants were very full but we had no issues getting in here. Still a little expensive but worth it in my opinion. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a more casual lunch or dinner when you're out shopping at Short Pump.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Marilyn S.,"Chesapeake, VA",48,74,299,3.0,10/7/2017,"I decided to take a lunch break between shopping. This place was pretty busy for lunch but my waiter handled the lunch crowd pretty good. I had bread with olive oil dip to nibble on while I waited for my entree. My iced tea was always topped off. I had the grilled veggie salad and added chicken. The half size was a very generous portion of delicious goodness. Roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, asparagus, corn with lettuce and avocado. Yum!  I can't imagine what the full size salad looks like. I was stuffed after devouring the half size. The salted caramel pudding looked good but I had no room in my belly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Latrice R.,"Richmond, VA",17,130,380,3.0,2/24/2017,"This was my first time visiting this pizza place! I've heard great things about them.  I ordered the mushroom sausage pepperoni lunch special  with a Caesar salad! The service was awesome and I would return. However, I had a small problem with a bug being in my salad. Initially he (not our waiter, possibly management) tried to disregard my concern for the bug in my salad saying it resembled the spice oregano. I picked around with my fork and explained to him that whatever it was had legs (possibly a gnat of some sort). I ordered the baked potato  soup as a replacement. All in all the food was great! I would revisit because my waiters service was awesome! The pizza was delicious and the salad was good minus the hiccup!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Elizabeth S.,"Henrico, VA",0,29,10,2.0,12/16/2017,"Hubby and I walked in, sat at bar for at least 5 minutes and not a single employee acknowledged us.

Emily M.,"Richmond, VA",194,122,44,4.0,10/16/2016,"This cali pizza kitchen is pretty good. Overall the food was good. We got BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple and the buffalo cauliflower. I wasn't expecting the cauliflower to be any good, my boyfriend ordered it. But it was amazing!! Super excepted. I'd try it. Also, the BBQ chicken pizza was your typical BBQ chicken pizza.  The service was good and everyone was friendly. They seemed a tad in experienced in the way the communicated with their customers but it didn't make a difference for us.  The food came out quick and everything was as it should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Tanisha K.,"Henrico, VA",21,61,108,4.0,3/16/2017,"Went here over the weekend. They were pretty busy so we had a 10 minute wait. Our waitress was nice you could tell she was handling a lot of tables so she didn't linger at our table for very long, more of a pop in every once in a while which was actually fine for us that night. The big excitement for me however was the food! As I've started in other reviews I am a vegetarian so going out to eat for me sometimes can get pretty stationary. So imagine my excitement when I walk in and see buffalo cauliflower bites on the menu! They were sooooo delicious; I actually wish they put a little more on the plate because really how expensive can cauliflower be? We also ordered some mac n cheese bites, a veggie pizza and some drinks. We left very satisfied!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Christine F.,"Miramar Beach, FL",180,1,,1.0,5/31/2017,"Went here for a relaxing lunch with a few friends. The meal started off fine: great service, great bread, great times. Then we got our entrees. My friend and I each got the bahn mi bowl, which looked interesting and different from the other items on the menu. As we were eating, my friend discovered that hidden in the miracle grain of quinoa, was a PIECE OF PLASTIC. Luckily she did not ingest said plastic, otherwise this would be an even ANGRIER review. The staff was responsive, however, and had the decency to attempt to make up for their carelessness by comping her meal.  The lesson learned is this: after a day at the mall, don't waste your time at this overpriced and neglectful chain, just go with your gut and get a pretzel hotdog from auntie Anne's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
James B.,"Richmond, VA",94,18,3,2.0,7/14/2017,"Great pizza ,good drinks, poor service. Pizza arrived before the lukewarm appetizer, because our server ""forgot about it"".

Susan C.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",0,1,,2.0,10/29/2017,Went this afternoon. Thought to get 1/2 sandwich with salad for $14.45 but told did not have this for weekend so told will take whole sandwich and waiter did not know price but would get back 2 me. Well he didn't and I forgot to ask so ended paying $16.00 for turkey sandwich with nothing else-no chips no nothing. That is ridiculous-felt like I was in New York.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Pam W.,"Richmond, VA",31,260,1201,3.0,4/19/2016,"The sun was shining, weather spectacular and I got my tax refund...let's go to the mall!   Shopping and lunch...that's it, that was the agenda for our Sunday. I needed it after a long week. So, where to eat with my two teenage daughters--one loves seafood, curry, etc., the other one prefers carbs with a side of carbs...she hates seafood, so my preference of the Boathouse was off the table.  Bakers Crust is always insanely busy on Sundays; Firebirds I like, but not in the mood.  We haven't been to California Pizza Kitchen since we moved to RVA 10 years ago. Let's give it a try.  We got there around 12:30, and while they were certainly busy, we were seared right away. One thing I remember and continue to notice is that there's not much atmosphere here.  They do have really creative artwork made of pizza boxes, which I appreciate, but tables are stacked right next to each other.  So, unless you get a booth, you're not having a private meal.  For drinks, water all around and the Coppola Pinot Grigio for me.  I like some Coppola wines, but this one was...not good.  Not much going on and definitely no challenge for the palate. To be honest it was pretty watery. I can't help but to feel a loyalty to Coppola because eons ago when Francis Ford Coppola was just starting in the wine business, my husband and I were doing the Napa Valley Wine Train and Coppola was on the train.  I thought that was really cool, so if there are two equal wines on the list and one is his, I'll buy it. Blind faith in a winemaker is not smart...learned that the hard way.  Back to food.  My youngest daughter ordered the chicken piccata, which she let me sample. It was what you'd expect...lots of lemons, capers and slightly pan fried chicken cutlets with pasta, of course.  My older daughter ordered the half Chinese chicken salad and the kids Mac and cheese. She says the Mac and cheese is the same size as adult but for less. I tasted both and the salad was good, but the Mac and cheese boring. My youngest daughter pointed out that they probably make it bland for the kids' palates. Good call and smart move on their part.  I ordered a special cedar-plank halibut with butternut squash and quinoa, asparagus and a light cream sauce. The portion was huge!  Basically it was two meals in one. While everything was good (I loved the quinoa), the butternut squash was undercooked and still crunchy, and the halibut had not even a trace of cedar. I eat cedar plank salmon from Firebirds and from Artist Point in Disney World (OMG...THE BEST FOOD,), so I may have expected too much. I did enjoy the fish, which was simply seasoned with salt and pepper.  I think it's hard for a chain to provide a stellar meal, unless they have super high standards and put food first. While I don't think PKC is stellar, it is consistent and if you stick to what you know, you should be good. The total for our bill and tip was around $100.  I wish I had spent that $100 at Tazza Kitchen instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Yvonne M.,"Richmond, VA",224,629,786,4.0,2/28/2016,"I didnt realize short pump town center removed the food court.. and since I was starving for lunch I ended up here. I was leery because based on the name I thought this was just a pizza place, and I wasnt in the mood for pizza. I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see a variety of choices on the menu. There was a wait to be seated, there was a crowded entrance full of hungry people waiting for tables. Our wait was about 15 minutes.  Once seated, our server Dominic came to take our orders, we chose the small plate spicy chicken tinga quesadilla as a quick appetizer. (What is tinga??) The small plates are really not an appetizer, its more of a side dish. It is on small size quesadilla cut into fours, and while it was delicious, its just a tease because its so small.  Entrees: I was disapointed to find out that although it was lunchtime, we couldnt order from the lunch menu because lunch prices are only served monday through friday. I cant understand why thats only a weekeday option??? Is it not lunch time on weekends and I missed that memo? The worst part was they only serve personal size pizzas on the lunch menu and my daughter couldnt get one because it was Saturday.  Needless to say, I  chose the California Cobb salad. This was just the right size for lunch. It had all the perfect blends of flavor a cobb brings smoked bacon, egg, chicken and gorganzola.  The rest of the table had avocado club egg rolls (yummy) , a steak with arugula salad and a kids menu cheese pizza. Everyone liked their food.  I will be back to try something else soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Carolyn Y.,"Newport News, VA",0,13,21,3.0,5/31/2017,"This restaurant was just mediocre. Maybe it's because I went with a lot of expectations, I was disappointed. The pasta was ok. Nothing phenomenal. We ordered the garlic fettuccine because it was a safe choice. Our table also got a chicken tequila pasta and it was NOT GOOD. The pasta literally tasted like peppers and the actual green peppers were soggy.  California pizza kitchen is known for its pizzas, and it was pretty good. Everyone seems to like the California club. It's a healthier choice because it's full of lettuce and avocados. The barbecue chicken pizza was good too, and the little bits of cilantro gave the pizza a kick.  Just another rant:  We ordered the barbecue chicken pizza with pineapples, but they forgot the pineapples. So when we told them that we wanted pineapples they gave us cold sliced pineapples in a little dish. The whole point of getting pineapples on a pizza is so they will be warm...  Finishing note:  I know that there are a lot of other restaurants in that area so I would go somewhere else with that money. I personally like Cheesecake Factory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Vivienne L.,"Philadelphia, PA",258,210,207,4.0,2/16/2017,This is a great place to go for lunch if you're just shopping around Short Pump! You get bread with your meal which is always good. Their artichoke pizza is great as well as any of the pastas. Service is pleasant. This is a great casual spot. Whenever I go I leave with leftovers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond
Stephanie H.,"Trinity, NC",88,341,325,3.0,1/23/2017,"The pizza was yummy but not worth the price tag or poor service.  It took an incredibly long time for our server to greet us and bring our drinks.  The poor guy had way too many tables to handle.  The white corn guacamole was delicious....but the portion you get is incredibly small, even for $5.  The guac is on the small plates menu rather than an appetizer so dont expect very much. I ordered the five cheese + fresh tomato pizza.  It was really good.  My sisters both ordered the tostada pizza and raved about it.  I expected a better portion for $13 - $15 pizzas.  That's like the price for a large or extra large in my hometown.  The flavor was there but the experience was lacking and didn't justify the cost in the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond

Kerry H.,"Forest, VA",32,9,1,3.0,8/11/2017,The food was okay at best. The service wasn't even that. We had to wait too many times to get refills on our drinks. I see why this place is only 3 stars.

Howard M.,"Midlothian, VA",10,53,603,4.0,6/17/2015,Always good especially the BBQ chicken salad and BBQ chicken pizza. Kids like the Mac n cheese too.  Never a long wait and can dine inside or outside with typically good servers. Bar is never very full and games are always on the flat screens. The server this time left a little to be desired. Sort of attentive but we had to ask for refills and avocado for the salad was requested to be on the side but was mixed in as normal.

Hannah G.,"Henrico, VA",12,204,3,3.0,7/5/2016,"Stopped by CPK this past weekend for the first time in a long time. Definitely left with mixed feelings... As we walked up, there were two small (8.5"" x 11"") printed signs that basically said the A/C was out. We decided to brave it anyway and see how things went. We were ""greeted"" by two rude hostesses. When we asked if there was any outdoor seating, they sassed an older member of our party about the signage. It was cooler outside than inside, which is why we asked... (Throughout the night these hostesses continued to be unhelpful to customers as they were more interested in speaking to each other and were even discussing Yelp reviews at one point. I just found it to be inappropriate.) Our waitress was very sweet, but spacey. To be honest, I blame it on the heat! Food was good, no complaints there.  The most shocking part of the visit was that in our initial interaction with the waitress, I made a comment about the lack of A/C, and she responded ""It's the 4th weekend in a row."" Umm...EXCUSE ME??? I am not knocking CPK for this, because I am assuming that they rent the space from SPTC. It is ABSURD that it would take SPTC this long to fix a tenant's A/C in the summer heat. Really a bad look for mall management. I was surprised that after so many weekends there were no fans plugged in and sitting on the floor, but to me CPK is being treated unreasonably by SPTC. Shame on them. I am hoping that most of this weird experience is attributable to the workers being subjected to very hot working conditions for at least 4 weeks. I imagine that could be frustrating. Will try again once the A/C is back... who knows how many more weeks that could take!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond?start=20
Da'Quan L.,"Richmond, VA",500,9,4,1.0,1/4/2017,"Terrible service, excellent pizza. I came alone into the sparsely-filled restaurant during lunch service expecting friendly service and tasty pizza. I was sadly disappointed. My server, Gio, introduced himself nicely but as is soon find out, provided terrible service. After I placed my order of Pepperoni Pizza and a Sam Adams, I had to ask him twice for standard bread and olive oil. I normally never have to request this, and even at my previous times at this location (as recent as last week) this is usually not the case. After essentially nagging him for the bread, my main course came out. I was very disappointed that I couldn't enjoy the bread prior to the lunch course. When I asked him about why the bread came out with the meal, he grumbled ""I was busy."" He didn't have many other tables at the time and the only thing I could think he was busy doing was talking to the young lady working in the bar-kitchen area. The food was good but the service was not befitting that of California Pizza Kitchen's brand standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond?start=20

Walked in last week and saw at least 7 unbussed tables. Piles and piles of dishes and tables that hadn't been bussed the whole time I was there. Went with friends the other day and both of them ordered the small plate crispy mac and cheese and didn't know until they got the check that their order was wrong.

Alexandria H.,"Harrisonburg, VA",47,43,3,5.0,4/27/2017,I work at the mall this week and next for training at one of the retail stores in the Short Pump Mall. I wanted something quick since my break is only 30 minutes. I ordered the BBQ sandwich there and was a little hesitant since it is known for its pizza. I was BLOWN away! The bread was sprinkled with melted cheese and crispy. The onions and slaw on top gave the best texture and crunch to the sandwich. It was estimated at 20 min before ready and was hot and ready in 15 minutes. I ate the entire thing and kind of wanted another one.

Natalie L.,"Charlottesville, VA",16,4,1,2.0,6/23/2017,"We usually really enjoy coming to CPK despite its priciness. This time around, quality was far from up to par and other restaurants nearby (like Cheesecake Factory and Maggiano's) would probably be a better bang for your buck.  We arrived earlyish for dinner and were seated promptly. Server came back frequently to check on us. Service was all fine and good - usually don't pay much attention to it - until we realized halfway out the door that every table except for ours had gotten bread before their meal! A travesty, really, that the bare minimum of restaurant service wasn't even achieved here. Second shock: menu was revamped (or should I say stripped down?) recently and we found that possibly the only distinctive, reliably tasty item on it was GONE. Moroccan chicken salad, anyone? Hands down our favorite salad and what we were looking forward to when we arrived.  Food came out quickly - like I said, service was all fine EXCEPT for the missing bread anomaly ??? - but was mediocre. The California cobb was fine, not worth the 15 or 16 dollars it cost, and every bite was like a sad, ghostly reminder of how much it WASN'T the Moroccan chicken salad (not kidding). Also ordered the Carne Asada pizza, which was also fine but standard fare at a pizza place or really any restaurant. So, it looks like we won't be coming back, unless MAYBE ... servers remember to bring the complimentary stuff (lol) and CPK resurrects our beloved salad. Please, it was too innocent and delicious to be a martyr for your ""improved"" menu. Don't change what already works.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond?start=20

Lindsey N.,"Fredericksburg, VA",39,55,28,2.0,2/8/2016,"Came here after Bakers Crust had a 20 minute wait... We are shopping with a 9 month old, and a stroller - as this is an outdoor shopping center.  When we arrive we inform the hostess that we require a high chair and would prefer be away from others, simply in case the baby begins to cry or raise hell. We also bring our stroller back with us, as it has much product in it, and our personal items - we were not going to leave it at the front of the restaurant, while sitting in the back. We were informed that they could only have high chairs along the back wall, so that no aisles were blocked for wait staff... Perfectly fine and understandable.  There are 7 tables along the back wall. One family was sitting in the middle of those 7, and we were placed at the very end corner. We placed the baby between tables so that he could have someone on each side of him. Not 10 minutes later, the hostess seats a family of four, also with a high chair at the table directly beside us. We then have to move the high chair we placed (for a reason) - as to not be rude to the newly arriving patrons. However, there were 6 other tables (with no one beside them occupied) along the wall in which high chair groups are placed...   I understand why everyone with a high chair is along the back wall, for exit reasons, open aisles for staff, etc... But with space elsewhere along this wall to sit people on top of each other is just irritating to say the least.  On top of that, the food was just 'okay.' The salad wraps were not good... And the lunch soup and salad option available on weekdays IS available during weekends at a different price for each... Which was fine as that's what we wanted - but the sandwich was again, just 'okay.'  The Baked Potato Soup was AMAZING... I would come here again for that... But for courtesy reasons - staff needs to be aware of seating and personal space, IF possible and not too busy of a time of day. For the sake of the review, the waiter we had, Giovanni, was very knowledgable, checked in often without hovering and was very kind.

Arthur F.,"Chesterfield, VA",48,228,350,2.0,12/6/2015,"It had been a long time since I had entered a California Pizza Kitchen, so yesterday in light of a really crowded Cheesecake Factory and a famished family, we stopped there for lunch. After a 15-20 minute wait, we were seated. The waiter greeted us warmly and promptly. He rounded up our drinks in an equally efficient manner. My wife and son decided to split a pepperoni pizza and I went  for bbq chicken salad. While we waited for the entrees they brought us bread, with oil. It was warm and passable, but that's about it. The meal was delivered by the chef, unusual but a nice touch. the pizza looked freshly out of the oven and actually looked good. Unfortunately, that's pretty much where it ended with the pizza. My son took one bite and my wife one slice, before saying they didn't like it. I ate a piece and thought the sauce, cheese and pepperoni was decent, but for me the crust was just plain no good. It had a bitter taste that in the end threw off the balance for the entire pizza. The bbq chicken salad was pretty good with a nice variety of veggies and dressing.

Keith S.,"San Leandro, CA",20,45,105,3.0,11/29/2013,"This California Pizza Kitchen is located in the Short Pump Mall, an affluent open air mall with stores like Nordstrom, Saks and other upscale shops. Outdoor dining is available but we opted for indoors on this cold November day. The interior is smaller than other restaurants I've experienced in the chain with dimmer lighting and darker fixtures, creating a more intimate space.  I was also pleasantly surprised by a minimal (2 minutes?) wait before being seated.  So far very good. Service was quick and our waiter very attentive, as if he anticipated our every want.  One person in our party remarked that our waiter could easily work in a very upscale restaurant with his level of service. My food was good not great.  The asparagus and arugula salad was a let-down but the meat lovers' thin crust pizza was tastier than expected, but who doesn't love more meat on a pizza?.  All in all things balanced out in the food department, yet the real plus for this CPK is the service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond?start=40

I mentioned to the server when I got in that I was admittedly in a bit of a hurry- had an appointment in an hour- and he was very good at making sure my food got to me as soon as possible and then getting the check to me to deal with at my leisure so I wasn't stuck waiting. He did try pretty hard to get me to order a dessert or something else to pad my tab [or possibly because the cake is really awesome, it -looked- good] but I suspect that it's mandatory to do so and he wasn't super pushy, so whatever. I had the asparagus and arugula salad, which was absolutely delicious- very fresh and well-dressed without being drippy or wilted, and the focaccia side which was... it was tasty, but strangely sweet, which I hadn't expected? I left feeling much better, regardless, and in the space of about 30 minutes which was good since it left me a lot of time to get to my appointment.

Adam L.,"Glen Allen, VA",7,21,,2.0,6/2/2013,"First let me say that we LOVE CPK! But the one at Short Pump lacks everything of what to expect from CPK.  If you're food is correct, expect pleasant service in a kid-friendly atmosphere.  If you're food order is delivered wrong, delayed, or not delivered with the rest of your meal... Expect no management apologies without demanding to see one. But alas the manager is there...flirting or talking to his hostess staff at the front of the restaurant. At least that is what my wife and I experienced on our LAST vist. What a disappointment for an over $60 bill.  And if you're ordering take-out, double check your order before leaving, otherwise management will blame you for not checking. As if the missing bread and butter was so much cost to them!!!

When I asked when they usually close the patio for my future knowledge, she said ""no set time, it just depends on our manager"" . So, I suppose that means crappy/discriminating manager and similar, dishonest host? We probably should have walked next door to bakers crust right then. But poor decision made, we proceeded to stay for: hard, stale bread ( not provided until we asked), used dipping oil ( also not provided until we asked), salads with ingredients missing that gave us upset bellies and unusually soggy pizza.
