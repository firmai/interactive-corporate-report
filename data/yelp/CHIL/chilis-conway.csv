Jennifer G.,"Sherwood, AR",8,8,1,5.0,8/31/2017,"This is easily the best Chilis I have ever been to. The food is always excellent and it's rare we have to wait more than 10 minutes. The servers are amazing!!! Tonight we went a bit earlier than normal and was seated in Blake's section. He anticipated our every need and made sure my pasta had enough sauce! I always forget to get the green onions off of my Cajun chicken pasta, but he made sure to double check that I wanted everything on it. Made my night! Also gave us drinks to go before we left and a box before I could finish asking. Best service ever! Definitely ask for him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Kim K.,"Fort Worth, TX",20,175,129,5.0,4/29/2017,"My step son and I stopped here for a late lunch.  They had a large group of teenagers in the dining area and I consider not staying because I was worried the food would take forever.  However we grabbed a booth in the bar area.  We were greeted immediately by a very friendly server.  We ordered fried pickles as a appetizer and they arrived quickly, My son ordered the crispy chicken fingers and fries and I had the shrimp tacos. Everything arrived quickly and was very good. When in Conway in the future we will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Brandy P.,"El Dorado, AR",68,12,,3.0,8/12/2017,"We usually love to eat at Chili's restaurants. We are here in a large group after my daughter's college graduation. The food was okay, but the services was great.  I must say that our only complaint would be is that we have had way better food, and our expectations as far as the food goes was met!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Cindy D.,"Conway, AR",0,23,,4.0,10/5/2017,"My daughter and I went to eat and we had the best time. Food was good but our server was hilarious. She called herself the old Lady, such a crazy personality and  refreshing. Had us laughing the whole meal... we could see she loves people and her career at Chilies. I had to tell the manager what great time we had! We will ask for her always",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Linzy S.,"Alexandria, VA",13,2,,5.0,6/26/2016,"Thankyou so much for your amazing service/food always ! At anywhere (any location)  I don't really give out review but particularly this one place I just have to give one!! My husband ordered Cajun chicken pasta and I had something chicken as well , I just don't remember but I have to say ....Hands down the best chicken I've ever had at any restaurant ! Love love love ~ I just don't know how they cooked their chicken but it's just so moist and delish !!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Micah S.,"Conway, AR",43,9,2,4.0,9/12/2016,One of my favorite places to eat. Never had a bad experience here. Good food and cold beer!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Jesse K.,"Tulsa, OK",2,24,2,2.0,12/6/2015,"Good food, but didn't honor the price in the menu. The unlimited soup and salad was one price before 4pm and another after. They didn't honor that and stated that it changes on the weekend. They don't have anything in the menu stating that.  My wife ordered a skinny margarita and had to order a second shot as she was convinced there wasn't any tequila on the first one. Just super sweet.  Too bad. I'm normally a big Chili's fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Cynthia S.,"Conway, AR",1,19,1,2.0,6/19/2016,"I eat here for my six year old. My meals are always hit and miss. I usually get the Caribbean chicken salad or the smoked chicken quesadillas. The staff are usually friendly and accommodating but the food is always very, very average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Mischita H.,"Orlando, FL",173,612,1346,3.0,12/4/2013,Pretty standard Chilli's lunch experience - friendly greeters and decent service.  I tried a lunch meal combo of chicken fajitas and salad.  Not bad. The inside temperature was a little bit colder than I'd like in December.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
William L.,"Kaneohe, HI",1,8,,2.0,6/7/2016,Okay for the drinks. Got food to go and got an easily medium steak rather than medium rare. Nice people there won't be back and I live right down the street,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Cheryl T.,"Little Rock, AR",0,36,,2.0,7/22/2016,"Limited selections on menu, lots of salt & burgers costing $10.99. David's is a much better choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Cyrilla A.,"Conway, AR",31,65,2,5.0,12/9/2014,This place is always on top of our list when we want to have pick up. Fast and delicious! Staff is always courteous. Never had any problems dining or calling in orders!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Kevin B.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,7,3,2.0,3/17/2015,"The service was very slow. The waiter only came by to check drink levels twice in the hour we were there. My girlfriend and I ordered two appetizers for our meal. It took 35 minutes for two appetizers . The food was great, right temperature and fresh. The time it reached the table we were almost in the process of leaving. Not a good experience at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Jim N.,"Winchester, KY",22,498,13,2.0,11/19/2012,"Busy place but this was my first visit since being a weekly regular several years ago at another location.  I was disappointed in menu changes that seem to focus on sauces, cheeses and fried......overall, we rate it as ""MEH""....  I guess visits at 3 to 4 year intervals is about right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Tim S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3,311,436,3.0,12/29/2012,It's Chili's.  They are the same no matter where you go.  The food is decent.  I use to think Chili's was the best until I started eating at other places. The Conway Chili's was good.  I think our waitress was a little goofy but she did a good job.  She did do a hard sell on specific margaritas to win some contest.  I normally despise this behavior but it was a few days before Christmas so I let it slide.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Gerard N.,"Conway, AR",2,25,31,4.0,4/11/2014,Its chili's. ... the food is good. it was especially good tonight. enjoyed my food & my wife loved hers. I think they are heating up because of the competition around them in Conway now. they are definitely holding their own.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Lyndsey G.,"Centerville, UT",0,7,2,1.0,7/2/2015,"Freezing cold in here! People are putting their jackets on. Our napkins are moving from all the cold air. We asked our server if she could check and see if they could adjust the air and no adjustments were made. It was so cold, we couldn't even enjoy our food and just wanted to get out of here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Sierra W.,"Conway, AR",0,3,,4.0,6/8/2015,"Love this chilis! Great food and service. I recommend the chicken bacon ranch quesadillas, it's the best food there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Emily L.,"Quitman, AR",0,10,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Awful experience. This isn't the first bad experience here, but the first time I had the yelp app to tell others about it. Ok, to start it off, the waitress was super loud and looked dirty and had food in her hair! Yuck. My mom ordered the fajitas and rice and I ordered ribs and some fries. The fries and ribs were cold when I got them and I had gotten like 10 fries max. Too little food for $10. My moms fajitas had hair in them and she didn't get her rice till right before we were about to leave. The plates had some kind of weird orange sauce on them, so they were dirty. The waitresses hand got in my moms guacamole sauce so that ruined those for her. Overall awful experience. I will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Nicole B.,"Norman, OK",48,69,56,5.0,1/14/2015,"Best Chili's I have ever been to. The food was prepared beautifully, and the service was great. The restaurant was very clean and the restrooms were also very clean and maintained well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway
Whitney A.,"Conway, AR",40,31,20,5.0,5/14/2011,"You know what, I love Chili's and I always have. Chips and queso, delish, carribbean salad, fantastic, tropical sunrise margaritas, yummy! Those are a few of my favorites. My husband loves the ribs, burgers and sliders. The staff here are always so great and friendly, unlike a lot of restaurants around here with lots of annoying college kids as servers. I've always had a good experience here and I'm glad because I want to keep going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway?start=20
Amanda D.,"Chicago, IL",121,134,,2.0,1/11/2009,"My review is for the service at the Chili's located in Conway.  I feel it's really unnecessary/unfair to rate Chili's on food since it is a chain and is basically the same everywhere barring any major disasters.  My food was great and exactly what was expected. However, my waitress was extremely rude!  Overall, it seemed like she was doing everything she could to get us out of the restaurant as soon as possible.  Mind you, the restaurant was not full at all so it's not like they were trying to turn over the table.  She gave us our checks in the middle of dinner and then proceeded to take my coworker's plate away when she wasn't even finished.  It was bad enough I almost said something to the manager on the way out, but didn't feel like starting a fuss. If you go here, I hope you don't get my waitress!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway?start=20
Christie P.,"Trout, LA",0,12,3,2.0,11/24/2011,"Not a Chili's I'd like to visit very often. We stopped here while traveling. Our server was very efficient and polite. However, the food was not up to Chili's quality. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't great! Everything from the chips to the chicken crispers was greasy instead of crispy. The salad and burgers seemed to be okay. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was not good. Floors needing sweeping and the Women's bathroom needed a good cleaning and dusting. I was very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway?start=20
Jessica S.,"Conway, AR",0,1,,5.0,5/14/2011,We went to Chili's on Mother's Day and even though they were extremely busy. We had the best server and service!!! Thanks Chili's for helping to make my Mother's Day AWESOME!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway?start=20
Britni G.,"Dover, AR",1,11,1,3.0,4/6/2009,"This is a chain, so the food is the same as all the rest. They have a good selection which can please the entire family. The service here is not always the best, especially during lunch.  And a warning for those who love To-Go food, make sure everything is in your bag. They've forgotten my tortilla's for the fajitas 3 or 4 times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway?start=20
