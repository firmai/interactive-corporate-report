Teresa N.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,10/12/2017,"Had dinner here tonight and it was... not the best. My fiancé and I had the 2/$20, I had the lemon chicken with cranberry and quinoa; the chicken was okay, but the quinoa and cranberry disgusting. My fiancé ordered the burger, asked for it to be medium well, came out medium rare in the middle and medium on the out skirts. He ate what he could and is now throwing up. Only good part of our meal was the mozzarella sticks. I even ordered a side caesar and it was nasty. Our server was okay, he forgot about us, and checked on us once.  Another server and manager was trying to bring us appetizers and we told them it wasn't our, manager sucked her teeth at us and just rolled her eyes....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Jessica R.,"Houston, TX",0,13,,1.0,12/1/2017,I love Applebees but not this particular location. The hostess placed us at the bar with our child. When we requested to the manager Robert that we wanted to change seats and sit somewhere else he lied and told us that he will but kept on having his servers proceed with our order at the bar. Very uncomfortable for me and my family. We decided to just get our meal to go. We will not be visiting this establishment again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Jaime L.,"Kemah, TX",73,145,455,4.0,6/21/2017,Food was good. Service was great. Price was right. And I finished the visit with one of the best brownies I've had. Called brownie bites,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Maria M.,"Lawrenceburg, TN",3,66,130,4.0,9/8/2016,"It was okay, is not our favorite place to eat but they do that 2 entrees for $20 which is if you wanna eat out but dint wanna spend too much thats will be a good deal... The steak came out good and the good thing they are open on Christmas day so if you are dont wanna mess up your kitchen on Christmas day and far away from family coz you cant take a long holiday off than you know Applebee is open on Christmas day .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3

Kayla S.,"Pasadena, TX",0,3,,3.0,4/9/2017,"Food and service was good!   Unfortunately, the restaurant has a weird/dirty smell to it which has always been the reason we don't go here much. I am not sure if it's the Carpet or what..... And the floor was sticky when you walk in the front door. Both improvements would do wonders for this restaurant in my opinion!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
June C.,"Pasadena, TX",11,11,,1.0,10/15/2016,"I haven't been here in quite some time but we still talk about how horrible a meal we had last time we went ---- the meat seemed rotten/rancid.  Never, ever will go there again ----- even at a friends' invitation",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Oliya C.,"Houston, TX",0,5,2,1.0,7/17/2015,"I do not recommend this place why? 1) they mess up your order 2) dirty place 3) cheat on food 4) even though they mess up your order, they want you to pay for that order you did not order. I am so glad we saw their mistake and they re do the check 5) I order 2 for $20 and they bring chicken pasta with 4 small slides chicken, but on menu it's much more chicken then what they bring 6) do not worth it at all 7) wetter just sad Sorry and he could not make us happy just to ask, maybe we want something else 8) chicken was very dry 9) I order chicken quassia and on that quasadia was most cheese than chicken",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Karen K.,"Pasadena, TX",0,5,,5.0,6/10/2017,"I had not been to this Applebee's in a while because I had gotten some bad service when it first opened. However, I went today and the service is very much improved. I was greeted at the door when I walked in, and our server Christine P was very nice and attentive. She even came out to the parking lot with my keys that I had left on the table. Food was also very good. I will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Michael C.,"Houston, TX",1,26,2,1.0,8/1/2016,Haven't been here in years. Stopped in yesterday for a quick lunch. I had the chicken fajita rollup. They didn't put any chicken or tomatoes on it. It was sad. I didn't decide to complain because looking at other reviews it seems quite common for them. I won't be visiting again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Aracely B.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,3.0,2/22/2016,"I'd been here three times with friends, but when I went about two weeks ago on a Friday night (not packed) the service was the worst.  We ordered a spinach dip, reminded the waitress after 30 minutes but we got the food and forgot all about it. I'm not saying I won't go back, it might have been the slow waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Maria S.,"Pasadena, TX",0,18,40,4.0,12/11/2015,"Food was decent. My kids food arrived way before mine, which I guess can be a good thing. Ordered the brunch burger which was pretty delicious and cooked to perfection! Manager came by to make sure service was great which is always a plus! Our waitress was Ashley and she too was very attentive. Definitely will return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Melissa F.,"Pearland, TX",51,16,3,4.0,4/9/2016,Today we hosted a fundraiser for our organization. It was a huge success! The manager Jonathon was great to work with from start to finish.

Kimberly L.,"Webster, TX",318,475,758,4.0,9/15/2012,"Now THIS the the Applebee's that I know and love! Friendly staff, hot food prepared correctly, and yeah I am back to being a fan here. I still may not come here that often as it's not right around the corner, an I know better than to come here on a holiday like last time, but I'm glad to know that it's as good as I expect an Applebee's to be. We got here kinda early on a Saturday evening and they weren't very busy; our server greeted us and seated us; he was super sweet and very engaging. If you go and get seated in Brandon O's area, you will be well taken care of! Our food was hot and fresh and Brandon did not let our glasses get empty; he brought extra napkins and just acted like he was really happy to be there. I'm sure being a waiter isn't an easy job but the good ones make it look easy.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was; maybe he had just taken over because this was a total 180 from the last time we were there. I was a little hesitant at trying this place again but we were hoping it was just a fluke or maybe they were short staffed from the holiday and it looks like we were right. I like being right. It makes me happy. And  now this Applebee's makes me happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Michael A.,"Pasadena, TX",0,13,,3.0,8/11/2016,This is a great place to get a hunk of meat.  The drinks are cheap and they have some good draft selections.  I really miss the nachos with ground beef and queso.  My wife likes their pina coladas,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3
Yaritza G.,"Houston, TX",0,33,12,5.0,3/2/2016,"Went today! got seated, the server assisted us shortly. There were not many people, we ordered wings and out entrees.

Deanne B.,"Alvin, TX",25,35,3,1.0,12/1/2015,Avoid the place. The appetizers were OK but the plates he gave us were dirty like someone just ate off them. So I didn't  tuch them. And my food had an odd taste. And my mother had ate half of her food. And ended up rushing to the bathroom with the runs. I ended up with  stomach pain and diarrhea.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3?start=20
Wanda G.,"Pasadena, TX",36,164,65,4.0,7/1/2014,"We come here a couple times a year.  Have never had to wait for a table - seated immediately. Staff is friendly, but not as attentive as I would like to have, explaining why it's not a 5 star. We tend to order the same thing when we are here from the 2 for $20 menu. I get the House Sirloin. Steak is always cooked as ordered.  Good flavor. I sometimes order the garlic mashed potato, sometimes the baked, but both cooked properly and not too much garlic on the mashed potatos.  My daughter is a pata freak so she orders the three cheese Chicken penne . She always has more than enough to take home. Good sized servings on all their meals.  We always have a debate about mozzarella sticks or the salad for the appetizer, but either way it's always fresh and good.  Tables are not always cleaned up right away, but it doesn't take forever either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pasadena-3?start=20

Michelle F.,"Houston, TX",47,20,9,1.0,7/4/2015,"The service was good. However the food was not. I ordered my son Mac and cheese. And you could tell by how it looked that it was just reheated. Not actually made when we ordered it. He barely touched it. And he loves Mac and cheese. The fries weren't very good. When we got our appetizer of mozzarella sticks, they weren't hot. They were just like warm. The food was just not worth the money. On top of that, my fiancé and I both ended up sick from it.

Dennis W.,"La Porte, TX",94,36,45,3.0,10/17/2014,The staff is too playful. There's a difference in having a sense of humor and being too playful.

Billy W.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",20,9,1,5.0,11/11/2013,"Came here for Veterans Day. The service was outstanding. We were seated promptly. When my elderly mother couldn't sit in the high seats in the bar area, they quickly found us a shorter table elsewhere. Our waiter, Austin, and the rest of the wait staff were very attentive and friendly. I ordered the crunchy shrimp and it was very good. Light and crunchy, the shrimp were cooked perfectly. And they put plenty of shrimp on the plate! My son loved the cheeseburger sliders. Very juicy and tasty. My mom liked the tortilla soup, tho she wished it had more cheese. My daughter sent back the Mac and cheese. They were very accommodating and replaced it with a kids corndog plate, which she liked.
