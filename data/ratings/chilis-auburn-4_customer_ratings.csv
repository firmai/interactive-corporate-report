42,Bryan D.,"Oxford, MA",11,480,73.0,4.0,2012-01-21,This place has changed for the better over the past couple years. the only down side is that it is a louder place with the occasional screaming kid. the good news is that they have 22oz margaritas to drown them out. the food is very reasonable priced for the quality and serving sizes. its def your best bet for a chain restaurant in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4?start=40,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

The Texas fries were ok. The bacon and jalapeño were added after the cheese was melted, so they did not stick well. I would not get these again.  The chips and salsa was huge. It must of contained at least a half of a bag that you would buy in the store. The bacon ranch quasadilla was large and filled. Tasty. The Cajun chicken pasta was not spicy at all. The Alfredo sauce tasted like velvetta. Not cool or tasty. It was very bland. The oreo Molton explosion was awesome. It had an angel food type cake. Not usually a fan of this type but it was filled with a white cream, hot fudge, oreo's and ice cream. Very yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

45,Howard C.,"Charlton, MA",0,3,,1.0,2013-12-11,"Let's see, where to begin. How about when we (an older couple) walked in and were seated next to a family with loud young kids celebrating one of the kids' birthday, even though the restaurant was 90% empty. The server arrived within 15 seconds after we sat down and asked if we were ready to order (the first of only two times in the whole experience she was prompt) before we had even picked up our menus. We said we needed more time, and she returned in another 15 seconds, when we were still basically opening the menus. Tried to order broccoli, which was on the menu but, we were informed, they don't actually have it anymore. I ordered an iced tea, which was warm enough that the ice melted on contact and was so bitter that it was impossible to drink. After ordering we waited for a long time to get our food because, as it turns out, the kitchen ""forgot a side,"" even though the meals come with two sides. So, we ate. Then the empty plates sat on the table for at least 10 minutes after we finished. Flagged several people down asking them to send over our server with the check. She finally arrived and told us that she had left the building to deliver an order to a hotel, and told her manager to send someone over to check on us. Needless to say, nobody ever did. The manager stopped by and took $8.00 off our $25.00 check, which included a $2.40 charge for a drink we never ordered! She also gave us some coupons for free nachos and salsa, which any real Mexican restaurant will give you for free anyway. Oh, and the bathroom had a very dirty toilet, along with a sign on the door that told diners to let them know if the bathroom was dirty. Not our job, but clearly not their job either. Needless to say, we left the coupons on the table as we have no intention of ever going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4?start=40,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

23,Sam T.,"Leicester, MA",1,17,14.0,3.0,2015-03-06,"I used to frequent this Chili's quite a bit when I had long breaks in between classes. It was a place to grab a quick, filling lunch then leave; the average time spent waiting to be seated, ordering, receiving the food, eating and paying the bill was around 45 minutes. Most days I was greeted and served by a woman named Robin who was enthusiastic and kind. She would remember me and the people I'd go with, and she would even go as far as to remember our orders! She is a wonderful waitress, and an even more fantastic person in general. Whenever I went I would always order the ribeye. I have to admit, I regret going there so often and spending so much money on a slab of steak (~$17) that was either a hit or miss when it came to 1) the quality of the steak: some days the steaks were marbled and juicy, some days it was plain old cardboard or 2) whether or not the steak was cooked the way I requested it: I like my steak rare and more often than not they would give it to me medium well. If I was unsatisfied with my steak they would happily take it back for me, but unfortunately it would take too long and the person I'm with would already be done by the time I receive my new steak. This Chili's offers free WiFi but it seems to only work in the central area of the restaurant towards the kitchen. If you're seated any further than the few booths close to where the waiters and waitresses leave to get your food then you probably won't have much luck. Overall this is a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat (during the lunch hours when they aren't swamped with customers) if they cook your food correctly. It is a bit expensive, but some days it's definitely worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4?start=20,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002

Start up restaurants could be taught how to manage cold and hot food offerings so they all arrive at the table at the same luke warm temperature.

We looked over to the dining room to see several tables empty (more than 5 that we could see) so we decided to wait along with a few other families. When we finally got our table we were placed next to the very noise kitchen when there was multiple tables in front of us empty? Maybe because we have a child?

We finally get refills on our drinks when we're just about done. He filled the ice right to the top of the glass so barely any liquid.

10,J L.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",0,1,,5.0,2017-06-17,"I frequent this chili's often. It is never a disappointment! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. The food is always delicious and hot, the drink selection is endless (you wouldn't know they were a chain restaurant!). Great place to bring the family, or stop in the bar for a cold one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
5,Joey T.,"Storrs, Mansfield, CT",0,35,1.0,3.0,2017-07-04,"Their food is pretty good. I like their boneless buffalo chicken and their fajitas. The service is occasionally good, but sometimes bad for to-go orders. They make me wait then tell me to go to the bar when I go to the to-go area and then go to the to-go area when I go to the bar. They either have poor staff or are understaffed because of corporate cutbacks or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

0,Helena O.,"Worcester, MA",124,76,158.0,3.0,2017-11-21,"I mean, it's Chili's....the food isn't great but the customer service was on point so they got three stars. We started with drinks, we decided on margaritas. I got the triple berry and my friend got the blueberry and pineapple flavor. Our drinks were really good. We ordered two rounds. We decided to get apps before deciding on our meals and we got an order of honey chipotle wings. As I was cutting into my wings I saw a black something....I wasn't sure what it was, but it wasn't a part of the honey chipotle or the white meat chicken....so I asked our server about it and she took it back to the kitchen as she was also unable to confirm what it was. Minutes later the manager came out apologizing and explained that the black thing on my plate was apparently from a piece of spinach from the southwestern egg rolls that has been burnt. Okay, no problem. That was really nice of him and he was extremely pleasant. For dinner my friend got the bacon avocado grilled chicken sandwich (which she said was not that grilled) and I got the Cajun shrimp pasta. We decided both were ""alright"" but not great. My Cajun shrimp pasta tasted exactly like the description. It's almost like everything was thrown together so it didn't have a savory taste, it had a ""throw together"" taste. If you cook, you know what I mean. The ingredients just didn't marinate well. As for the burger, my friend didn't finish hers. When asked if she wanted to wrap it up (that's how much she had left) she politely declined. The food here is subpar, not the restaurants fault. It's a chain. It's to be expected. Overall the service was really great, which like I said made up for the mishap and mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
1,Sarah C.,"Worcester, MA",216,373,215.0,1.0,2017-11-27,We ordered takeout from here.  The only reason this gets a one star is the food that we did get was actually pretty good.   I drove about 15 minutes between back and forth to pick it up.  I get home and we are missing the rice and beans that make the fajitas a meal.  I call and they say to come back and they will get it for us.  I go ALL the way back and the manager gives me the food and says that he cancelled the charge for our food.  I asked him what he was going to do for my troubles and he said that he would just cancel the charge for our order and that he tripled checked that it was right this time. I take the bag to the car and check it for myself.  It was not right and it was actually more wrong this time than last!  Back in for a 3rd time... they finally corrected and he was like well you can keep the wrong one for your troubles... seriously... We definitely won't be back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
