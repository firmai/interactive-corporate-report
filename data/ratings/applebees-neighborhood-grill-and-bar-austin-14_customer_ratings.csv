Also, this review is not based on just a couple of experiences...unfortunately I am stupid enough to give this place more than a couple of trys... First, The service is slow (turtle slow!!) I asked the waitress to give me a couple of minutes to decide and she came back after 20 minutes after I waved my hand. I literally regretted not to order when she was there for the first time!!!....Then another 20 minutes to get the food. I ordered Hot Wings (an appetizer) and Sirloin steak!!...Wings were not HOT (as in temperature)!!...Sirloin wasnt well done and I had to send the steak back to get it well done:( when It came back, It was VERY VERY well done and I couldnt even chew it...Only thing I liked was celery with ranch and wont go there again just for that...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=60,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

74,Jon P.,"Austin, TX",9,10,,1.0,2013-05-27,"Applebees, America's worst restaurant. Over the past year I have eaten at Applebees on 5 occasions and had one good experience. I thought for sure it was just the location, but now just a firm believer it is Applebees in general. This is a novel, but could go down as one of my worst restaurant experiences ever.  My friend and I get sat and our server is wonderful to begin with and provides exceptional service. The restaurant is dead with one big table of 15 or so people and one other table in the whole restaurant.  Our waitress brings out our steaks and disappears and I mean disappears, no where to be found. Anyhow, we aren't at a fancy steakhouse, so obviously she isn't trained to say ""can you cut in the center of that steak and maked sure it is cooked as you ordered.""    I ordered medium rare and she ordered medium. Well, her steak is rare and her mashed potatoes are cold. We wait for five minutes for our waitress and she is nowhere to be found. Matter of fact, not a soul around until I go to the bar and the bartender comes over to the other side of the restaurant and helps us out. Asked how she ordered her steak and said ""wow, that is RARE, far from medium, we will get you a new plate out shortly"".  Ten minutes go by and a steak is brought out with two helpings of potatoes. Well, the steak is about 1/3 the size of the steak she had ordered and there were blood droppings all over the plate. It looked disgusting, then the steak had A-1 on it and she didn't order A-1.  We ask for the manager and he says ""can I get you a new steak"" disgusted, my lady friend says ""no, I lost my appetite with this experience."" Manager says how can I make this right. I inform him we had a free meal here because our last experience was so miserable and would like to use it for this meal as we won't be back."".  15 minutes go by and our waitress who hasn't been seen since she dropped off the original steaks is still MIA. I ask the manager ""Can we get our tab so we can go as it has been 15 minutes since we asked for our tab.""   He brings back the tab and took $8 off of it and said 'have a nice day"". I asked him flat out, excuse me, has our waitress been phased as she started out so amazing but we have not seen her once since she dropped off our food."" He says ""I don't know."" and walks off.  1. You are the manager of a restaurant and you don't know where she is?  2. Make something up, give me something, just don't walk away.  Sorry if this seems petty, but it was so gross. Wish I could articulate in words how gross her plate looked with a quarter size steak, blood droppings on the plate and A-1 on the steak when she never put A-1 on it. Batting 200 as a restaurant is not the way to run an operation. Save your money, time and experience dining someplace else as Applebees SUCKS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=80,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

I saw that.  He was also incredibly rude when I asked what came on the potato... ""well it's your usual loaded potato.""  ""okay well everything except chives then.""  ""Well it doesn't have chives so.""  ""Well that's why I asked.""  ...Are you kidding me??  Thanks Matt, I'll definitely tell everyone I know to avoid this place because you were a total jerk even in front of the other guests.  TERRIBLE SERVICE!  Let's just say the $30 Christmas tip turned into the usual $4 for you because we were treated like trash.  Ho ho ho!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=80,2.44,2.44,2.44,1.7320000000000002,2.44

It was Saturday around 845. Walked in and it took the hosts about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were there. There was a family of 5 and a couple ahead of us. Since we were all awkwardly standing there I asked the couple how long they'd been waiting and they said they had walked in only a couple if minutes before we did. The host came up and unplugged a phone and still didn't acknowledge us or the other couple. She sat down the family of five and we decided to sit down.  She then returned and said it would take 10 minutes to sit us and the other couple down. We said it was okay but the other couple left and a few minutes later she sat us down. Our server came over 5 minutes after we sat down and took our drinks. We weren't ready so she gave us a few to order. We finally ordered and noticed that it wasn't all that busy so we thought we would be served pretty quick. We were wrong. 20 minutes passed and we didn't even have our appetizer. The server came after 25 minutes and said she was going to check what was going on with our order. I figured since she had walked by us a few times already that she would have asked 15 minutes after. So after a 30 minute wait we decided to walk out.

The food took an inordinate amount of time to come out, and was so cold that the grease was pooled on top of the chicken tenders and cheese on the wrap was congealed. The chicken tenders were over cooked, hard and dry. The salad was soggy and limp from the dressing, and heavily coated in dressing. The tortilla soup hardly had any broth. The chicken on the salad was dry. The table they sat us at was clearly dirty with food crumbs and hair, yet we still had to point it out and ask for the server to wipe it.

So this man is seating is next to the bar and I asked if we could sit farther away from the bar because the loud rap music was not something I want to have blasting in my ear while I'm having dinner. He makes some snide comment which I can't remember now and moves us to a booth across the restaurant. Peaceful. Things got WAY better after that. Our server Shellie was incredibly sweet and attentive. She deserves a raise. Now the food. Yum! We started off with the sriracha shrimp. Pretty damn good. Then we got hot boneless buffalo wings which were spot on as well. My boyfriend ordered some meal that consisted of sweet chicken strips over Mac and cheese with bacon bits. It was a little strange but still tasty. I ordered a fiesta chicken or Santa Fe chicken I don't remember but it was hella good! The cooks were definitely on point.

38,Emily D.,"Richmond, TX",0,1,,1.0,2015-08-15,"I ordered online for a car-to-go order to be picked up at 5:37 PM. I got there about five minutes before and walked in around 5:40. When I walked in, I could see several girls in the kitchen cracking up about something but the floors were dirty, and the phone was ringing off the hook. When one of the girls finally finished her conversation, she rushed over to the phone and was rude to the customer. She had no tact and a horrible attitude. Once she finally got to me, I told her my name and she said to wait by the bar and they'd bring my food out. I waited by the bar, and the manager walked out asking if I ordered online. I answered yes, and he frantically searched for my ticket. My food hadn't even been made yet. Finally, he apologizes and let's me know I can take a seat and my food will be out shortly. In this time period, there was salsa spilled on the floor that no one cleaned up, and they laughed at the person who spilled it. You could hear the manager barking orders to the kitchen staff. When they brought my order out, they asked me to check it. I went through it but was missing a burger that I paid for online. The girl told me they could make me another ticket and I could pay for it there if I wanted to. I let her know I had already paid for it but would pay for it again since I just wanted to leave. I took another seat and the manager came over with my card letting me know they wouldn't be charging me for it. While the manager in the situation was incredibly helpful, the rest of the staff seemed more involved in conversation than cleaning, and helping the customers. I can honestly say I will never return to this particular Applebee's and I'm less than impressed, and more disgusted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=60,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.924,2.04

But the real reason I only gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because TWICE we found a pubic hair in the food! Once in the tortilla soup and the 2nd time on the boneless wing appetizer!

93,Sam G.,"Austin, TX",8,67,8.0,1.0,2015-10-23,"Oh boy. I worked here, and it deserves the low rating. Let me explain why and how. This is an Applebee's in a particularly ghetto location - about 90% of the people who come here on a regular basis are terrible people and even worse tippers. Combine the two, and you have a waitstaff that is angry about getting treated horribly by demanding customers and hilariously underpaid. It is incredibly disheartening to treat people well and then be tipped a dollar on $40 because they're inherently cheap people. This happens enough, and people start quitting. I've seen waiters have food thrown at them, I've seen waiters have 2 tables on a lunch shift, get stiffed on both, and leave the restaurant owing money due to tip-out requirements. I've also seen waiters literally fight each other in the restaurant, I've seen a gun flashed while working here, and I've seen literal pimps come in with their... Employees. It is a terrible, hostile environment. Eventually, enough people quit that management has a hard time keeping up with hiring, so you have a revolving door of waiters who are semi-trained, not the best crop you can find, and who are equal parts anger and stupidity rolled into one. So you have angry, shitty waiters waiting on angry, shitty people all day. If you are one of the normal people coming in, you'll either get the best service of your life because that waiter is so desperate for normalcy that they treat you like royalty, or you get shitty service that's based on how awful their day has been. Believe me, we can spot a decent customer from a mile away. We can see and smell a bad customer from even farther. The food is your typical Applebee's microwaveable TV dinner. The cooks are trying, but they don't really have a lot of leeway with how they cook things. Sorry, if you expect better, don't go to Applebee's.  The decor is a combination of late 90s and downtrodden urban decay.  The drinks aren't weak because the bartender is stiffing you. The drinks are weak because you ordered a $2 margarita with bottom shelf liquor which is basically watered down rubbing alcohol with food coloring.  If you are a decent person, stay away from here. If you're a thuggin ahole who wants to show off to your hoe but can't afford the tip, don't worry, you'll fit right in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=40,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.7640000000000002,2.04

8,Dan F.,"Austin, TX",3,5,2.0,4.0,2015-11-12,"Appelbee's has a very generous Veterans' Day discount which earns huge respect from me. They are part of the same corporation as Chili's and Olive Garden, and as a Navy veteran I eat at one of those places each year usually. I've gotten consistently good service each time and this Appelbee's was no exception. I also appreciate the late hours that they're open (until 2am even on Vets Day) because I tend to eat dinner past 10pm. So I got the late night shift staff, and got outstanding service, which is why I'm writing a review of a chain restaurant that probably doesn't need publicity. My server was a slim, tall blonde woman that I'd guess was around 32-38, but I forgot her name. She was super friendly and cheerful despite the late hour, checked on me diligently, and thanked me for my service as a veteran. I tipped what I guessed (since it was free) was 30%, and afterwards wished I'd tipped even more. I ordered the 7oz sirloin steak medium rare and I was impressed how the cooks grilled that right to perfection, just like I wanted, exactly medium rare. The meat was juicy, flavorful, a bit chewy like it should be at medium rare. It was no Roaring Fork ribeye but for the normal price it would be a very good deal. Veggies and mashed potatoes were savory.  Other commenters have noted that the surrounding neighborhood tends to be low income, but with gentrification advancing in Austin at a frantic pace that won't last. This part of town is getting to be one of the last places a working person can buy a house in. This restaurant targets people pulling off the interstate hence the late hours I assume. The lighting was bright all around the restaurant and I felt safe parking here around midnight. Maybe because I always behave on Vets Day like I'm grateful for a free tasty entree, so I'm respectful to the staff, so I got great service, but then I always try to behave that way (you can't complain about bad service if you were a difficult/rude customer). It's the same everywhere, be a decent customer and you get optimal service. If the servers at this location have to endure a lot of cheap tippers then you'd never know it. Raise your staff's wages if the customers' tips trend low, management. Both my maitre d' and waitress were outstanding, steak was grilled just right. For a chain restaurant at midnight I couldn't expect more. I'd give it five stars but there are numerous other places in town that are my favorite steak houses, and I can't grade it as high as them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-austin-14?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.128,2.08

Sat down at 3:45 and didn't get our food until 4:30. We ordered 3 orders of the boneless wings and the French Onion Soup, as well as an appetizer if Sriracha Shrimp and the Artichoke dip. We never received the appetizers.   As for the wings, tool 45 minutes to get 2 of the orders (my brother and sisters).  Mine never came until I asked the manager about my wings, which came out 10 minutes after everyone else.   I would maybe understand if they were busy, but our waitress has 3 tables, and we're the largest (a 6 top).  We had to ask her three times just to get my mom and SIL glasses of water. Ive been to the Applebee's in Round Rock many times and never had service like this. Seriously, spend the extra 10-15 minutes to drive up to Round Rock and to there. You'll get better service and more than likely be out of there before you'll even get your food here.  I honestly wish we had gone somewhere else at this point at this point. Edit: I will say they did comp part of our order, which was nice. I don't know if it was an off day or if it's always that bad there.

89,Jessica D.,"Warrenville, IL",27,19,,1.0,2016-11-03,"If I could give this zero stars I would. Granted, an Applebee's on its own is not expected to be some sort of fine dining experience, but I don't think capable service is out of the question. We walk in and get sat pretty quickly. Then we wait and wait. Finally a server comes by and grabs our drink order. Then another server proceeds to try to get our drink order again. No big deal, but in the time it took the original server to actually get the drinks, the other server came by and did the same thing again. They were not that busy, maybe 6 tables between 2 servers. We ordered a couple appetizers and when they arrived, it was very clear that the boneless wings had been sitting in the window for awhile. Considering how long it took to get them, we just ate what we had. I ordered a Chicken Fajita Roll-Up which has been a staple in their menu forever. Trust me, I worked at an Applebee's for almost 3 years in the early 2000s, so I know this is true. I get my food and there is an absolutely ridiculous amount of mexi-ranch dressing inside the  wrap. I finally flag down the server and point out that every time I have ordered this before, the sauce was on the side and meant for dipping. She tells me that she has only been there for 2 weeks and she would do something to get it fixed. Fair enough. After another 15 minutes, she come back with another one prepared correctly. She then proceeds to tell me that the cook told her that he knew it was wrong when he made it, but had hoped no one would notice. What?!? Unfortunately, the replacement was pretty obviously quickly thrown together and the tortilla was extremely soggy since they had not put it under the broiler (side note - that is how they did it when I worked there, I cannot vouch for whether or not the preparation has changed since then). I took one bite and decided I was done. We ask the server for the check and she doesn't even question why there is only one bite taken and a napkin thrown on the plate. We pay and get the hell out.  After spending over an hour there, I still left pretty hungry.
