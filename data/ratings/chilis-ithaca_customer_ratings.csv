10,Name N.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",25,74,11.0,3.0,2013-07-20,"I like Chili's for a go to over fast food. Southwest chicken egg rolls, and pork ribs. Yum. Happy hours and 2 for $20 that my budget can handle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,
9,Justin V.,"Ithaca, NY",21,143,13.0,3.0,2013-09-24,"So as a burger fan I naturally am inclined to try burgers everywhere I go an Chili's was no exception. Now I've been to Chili's in the past and the fact that I can't remember how the food tastes is probably not a bad thing...nor is it a good thing and so I went to try it once again with full thoughts in mind to make sure I remember how this tastes. So I got the Southern Smokehouse burger because come on now, ancho-chipotle sauce, crispy onion straws and bacon? That's a recipe for a burger if I ever have heard one myself. Needless to say the burger did live up to it's menu description and it was a pretty darn tootin' good burger. The burger was properly seasoned and the toppings were great. The bun was perfect sized and overall it was good. But when I was finished it didn't hit me as the best burger ever. It was a good burger though, even a great burger. The thing that threw me though and the reason this is getting 4 stars and is now number 8 on my list is the Fries. The fries here were atrocious. Soggy and a few were room temperature. Maybe when they were fresh they were good but for the one time I went and from what this review is based off of I can tell you that the fries were way sub par. And fries can make or break your burger!  Overall I'd probably go back to see if the fries get better but as of right now, great burger, bad fries. They should also make a Chili's signature sauce. TGI Fridays has the Jack Daniels Sauce, Red Robin has their signature burger sauce. For Chili's something like a Mexican Barbeque sauce would be great, something a little spicy, maybe a little sweet. Something that would keep me coming back for it as it would be something I couldn't get anywhere else. I think that's what makes a place so great is that they do or have something no one else has. Maybe it's the bun, the sauce, a topping or maybe even the burger itself or the way they cook it. I feel like any one could make what Chili's made but like I said I'm going to give it a second shot and see. Btw happy hour appetizers RULE! Keep that happenin'!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,
4,Lola A.,"Ithaca, NY",14,44,6.0,1.0,2013-09-30,"Only two reviews?  Shocking.  Or very telling. In an act of desperation we went to Chili's over the weekend as the boy wanted a quesadilla.  By the way, based on quesadillas alone, I'm sure the 9 year old would rate this dump a 5. For starters:  Menus smeared with food.  Disgusting.  Our server, Lauren, couldn't have been less interested in serving us.  Apparently she is allergic to eye contact.  She seemed annoyed that we were ready to order when she brought our waters.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for our appetizer, although she brought my husband's side salad.  Isn't a side salad served WITH YOUR MEAL?  AFTER the appetizer??  She never bothered to come over and tell us why it was taking so long.  When the appetizer came, (potato skins) they were overflowing with too much melted cheese (I'm sure this would be a plus for someone but not me) and so hot we weren't able to eat them right away.  Of course by then our meal came.  Another thing to piss me off. Shrimp tacos were messy.  They used to serve them in these cool little taco holders in order to keep them straight.  These were slopped on a rectangular plate that was far too narrow and the tacos were soggy.  Husband ordered the Bacon Avocado Chicken sandwich - can you believe he actually expected that there would BE avocado on this sandwich!?  I mean - look at the picture I attached, how dare my  husband expect to be served the same sandwich that they picture in the menu?  You know, the one that actually is LOADED with avocado. As a side note, I totally eavesdropped on the table next to us.  They got their food and the waiter was back at their table before they could even get the first forkful in asking if they wanted dessert or a takeout box.  Seriously?  Also, as we left he had dumped a tray of drinks on them with a flourish. I'm sick of this place.  Only giving it one star as the only good thing I've ever had from Chili's is a two-for-one bloody mary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,

11,T K.,"San Diego, CA",7,115,188.0,4.0,2014-06-29,I had not eaten at Chili's in probably 10 years. My previous memory of the restaurant was that it left nothing to be desired. I stopped by this location while on a road trip. The food was delicious and our waiter was very nice and attentive. I will definitely dine at Chili's when I get back home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,

6,Nancy S.,"Dublin, CA",4,77,1.0,4.0,2015-06-01,"We had a great experience here when we were in town for graduation.  The service was great.  The food was very good - we all ordered different things and we all enjoyed what we got.  The fresh guacamole made at the table was especially fantastic and the chips they serve it with beautifully thin and crispy.  We are not in Ithaca often, but we would definitely eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,
3,Robbie D.,"Warwick, NY",37,17,60.0,1.0,2016-03-24,"Drove up from Courtland, NY to celebrate our 5 year old sons birthday. Waited over 1 hour to be seated while there was no wait for a table for 11 (which was empty and ready). Management said they wanted to catch the servers up so they won't be overwhelmed before they sat us. Finally sat and waited another hour to get our main courses. Appetizer Guacamole was awful and was returned and switched to red sauce. Staff was friendly but it appeared they only had 1 chef. Never again. Love Chili's but not this one. Would definitely not recommend. By the way our food came out COLD......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,
5,D S.,"Ithaca, NY",1,20,,5.0,2016-08-15,"Absolutely phenomenal service from the staff and waitress. John, the manager, engaged us with a genuine interest in our dining satisfaction. His attentiveness shows in the cleanliness of the store as well as employee moral. Best chilies I've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,
2,Anna G.,"New York, NY",68,26,,3.0,2017-03-09,"Came here for dinner with a lot of people since we are on a college trip. It was a fun place. And the burgers were good except the time from ordering and waiting for our food and drinks were so long. So that's why I rated it 3 stars when it could have been 5 stars if they let us have our foods and drinks quicker. Also, the food and drinks were good as well. I had the classic bacon burger. It was good though so only if the food came out quicker and if they seated us quicker. And there was also one server with 5 tables. They should have more workers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,

0,Andrew B.,"Ithaca, NY",136,1,,5.0,2017-11-20,These people are awesome. We showed up 15 mins before closing and they served us. Literal savages. A+ service. Come here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ithaca,,,,,
