Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,647,3101,5.0,11/26/2017,"We stopped in here on a weeknight to take advantage of the happy hour deals.  If you sit in the bar area there are some really reasonable happy hour specials available on food and drinks. The happy hour food options are the same size portions as the regular menu, so you are saving a decent amount. Dawn was the server and she was super efficient.  She was great about checking back on us too! We all ended up ordering appetizers from the happy hour menu and liked what we had. The best part about CCF is the dessert.  I highly recommend grabbing a slice of cheesecake and taking it home for later.  I always leave this establishment stuffed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples

Syl H.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,44,94,4.0,11/25/2017,"So great to be back in Bonita Springs away from the cold winter. While in Naples, one  of our favorite go to chain is  The Cheesecake Factory. We don't have one at home so it's always nice to get away from winter and enjoy a meal on the patio. While they have a large menu to choose from. We love their lettuce wraps with extra chicken on the side. If you don't like eating with your hands, this meal is not for you. This meal is, tasty and full of flavours.  Don't miss out, give it a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples

Larry B.,"Miami, FL",93,48,219,4.0,6/30/2017,The cheesecake factory never disappoints. It was my first time eating at this Naples location and we got seated rather quickly (take that Miami).  I ordered the Thai-Coconut-Lime Chicken (Definitely  give it a try). It is a nice sized portion and it was delicious. It comes with regular rice but I decided to substitute the regular rice for brown rice instead (big mistake). The brown rice was soggy... Almost to the point of being a risotto. This is the only reason why I'm giving 4 stars.  If you like curry and a bit of spice in your food this is the plate to order. It also has bits of mango chunks.... Mmmmm Mmmmm good. I accompanied my food with red sangria (very refreshing).  My friend ordered a chargrilled New York steak with asparagus and mashed potoes.... She reports that her food was great and the steak very flavorful and juicy. Greta job!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples

Meghan Z.,"Kansas City, MO",0,168,14,2.0,12/30/2017,It's a chain. It tastes like one and operates like one. Anyone going here knows that. Nothing spectacular to share nor negative. Always over crowded. Even a long wait to just buy cheesecake (the best thing on the menu) and go. There are plenty of other local bakeries with amazing cheesecake as well.

Elizabeth D.,"Naples, FL",23,57,28,4.0,11/23/2017,"I have eaten here twice so far and honestly I'm not in love with the food but it does give a satisfying feeling. The food is definitely on the saltier side but if you add some hot sauce or pepper flakes it is perfect. At first the prices seem way too high but when you see the portion sizes, they make more sense. Even with the huge portions, it is still on the pricey side, but let's be real. This is Naples. All in all, I'm not itching to come  back but I'd happily eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples

They have a large menu with different varieties, which is great. The waiters are fairly nice but they sometimes look overworked. There's indoor and outdoor seating, and also a bar area where you can seat yourself. This restaurant is location right next to the coastland center mall (walking distance).

And of course the all time fave appetizer....Avocado Egg rolls!!! Have been at these restaurants since 1990 on the NE coast. Always great, always consistent.

Thankfully they had several ceiling fans so it was very comfortable dining. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps which I substituted with shrimp instead of chicken and they were fantastic as usual. My husband ordered chicken parmesan which was tenderized until it was very thin, it was perfect!  I tried my husband's key lime cheesecake and it was to die for!!!!! For it being so busy I was amazed of how great the service was. It was fast and and the employees worked well together on a very busy day. The manager checked on every table, they were on their game!

But I was like a I'm going to need a better seat then this I can't believe they even would sit Simone here but they found me a better seat either the rest of the folks in the restaurant. Anyway food was great my waiter David was on point all night even with him singing happy b day to my girl was the best. He definitely needs to be getting props for his promptness and style.

Just_me H.,"Naples, FL",0,80,11,3.0,4/29/2017,"Stopped in for lunch, Saturday afternoon about 130pm, restaurant seemed very busy. We were promptly and courteously greeted by a couple of the host staff and seated immediately. Our server was at the table immediately and took our drink order.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke heart app, which came out right away. Our order was then taken, and arrived almost as fast but we didn't feel rushed.  The service was impeccable, our drinks never got half empty before they were refilled. The food was.. ok. It wasn't bad in any way, the portions were definitely sufficient, the presentation was very nice , but not exciting flavor wise.  Again, it wasn't bad, but kind of plain, flat... Nothing jumped out at us as a favorite, or exciting.   It was a bit pricey for lunch with no alcohol but I need to stress that the service was top notch",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples

Gloria S.,"Naples, FL",382,818,2380,3.0,11/21/2015,"Why do I keep returning? I am a hopeful person married to an all American guy happy with a burger. However, he does love bread and claims their brown bread is the best., since it's served free at the tables, also hard to resist. I give an extra star for service but as for food, I am out of things to order as a gluten free vegetarian. I don't like their salad dressings. I gave into ordering the Miso Salmon which use to be a favorite.  Well, read this loud and clear, BRING YOUR OWN RICE! Previously they have had problems with the rice being hard, under cooked and cold. Don't they own a rice maker? Dump the cook who can't boil rice,  In addition, today when they had 3 chances to make it work, it did not. I thought I was being proactive when I asked for white instead of brown,  well, no go. Look at my pic and you will see what I did eat.  Also it all went downhill when they changed to the cheaper grain instead of having their original recipe of sticky rice.  It was not a pleasant experience, at these prices, again, not worth the gamble.  Again,why do I come?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples

Joe J.,"Marlborough, CT",0,1,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Really like TCF overall and usually have great service, good food in any other one of their locations. Have tried the Naples location several times. No matter when we visited, food was not good and service was bad. Last visit was a take out order which we called in. Despite being charged for extras like ""spicy chicken"" on the house factory nachos and the same on the Mexican tortilla salad TCF still managed to not include them despite being charged for it. And on top of that the food we did get was terrible. How do you make a bad salad? Go to TCF Naples and find out for yourself. Even the $10 slice of cheesecake, which is what the place is named for, was terrible. Does anyone check the quality of the food served there?

Deisy C.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",340,23,136,2.0,8/16/2015,"Tonight we decided on cheese cake factory located at Coastland mall in Naples, fl. The parking was packed and so was the restaurant. We asked for a table for two, our wait would be 25-30 minutes but we ended up scoring a bar room table in less than 10 (I always get lucky with those grab and sit tables! Lol)  We were served water and bread right away but our bread plates didn't show up for at least 20 minutes. We ordered the steak Diane and Herb Salmon combination platter, which is my favorite.  When the food came out my boyfriend and I noticed how uneven both our plates were and how skimpy the steak was. When the waiter asked how everything looked I mentioned our disappointment but it was quickly dismissed with a ""ah well I hope it fills you up"". Everything was mediocre, the salmon had so many herbs and steams on it I had to scrap the top layer off and the steak was dry. I must say I've had better. The waiter passed by but not stopping at our table about 3 or 4 times holding a pitcher of water and not once refilled my water until I was done eating, I ended up having to stand up and grabbing a refill from the bar. Honestly terrible service.  Probably won't be back to this location for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=20
Dara E.,"Smithtown, NY",59,2,,5.0,4/15/2017,"Let me tell you about another experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Our waiter was either named Jack, Jake, or Zack. Despite not knowing his name, I liked him. Let me tell you why I felt this way about him. Everyone who goes to The Cheesecake Factory knows about the beloved brown bread. When I go with my friends, we often take a full loaf for each person. However, we quickly eat it and feel lost and confused, not knowing what to do without our brown bread. My pal and fellow The Cheesecake Factory enthusiast, Courtney, asked our waiter (name still unknown) for another basket of brown bread before he even finished pouring our water. He seemed overwhelmed at our eagerness to obtain more brown bread but quickly delivered his promise. However, we finished the bread once again and it was my turn to ask him for more. After I ordered my veggie burger (without cheese or mayo) I asked for more brown bread. Our waiter (name still not clarified) gave me what I like in a man. I asked him for brown bread and he only gave my brown bread. We got our main course and I was not disappointed, especially in the side of french fries I had the pleasure of consuming. The veggie burger had good flavor, texture, and was overall a good eating experience. As a vegan, I felt out of place watching my friends pick out their preferred cheesecakes. I didn't know how to react to not being able to eat cheesecake but I got through it. It's safe to say the restaurant provided a divine eating experience and my pants were not super super stretch after my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=20

The chicken was bitter, the asparagus awful, and the mashed potatoes aka three hard things you couldn't even bite into. Needless to say it went in the trash. Also during this visit they forgot my cheesecake. Tonight, however I decided to stick to what I know and ordered the chicken maderia again.

I'm so torn with how I feel about this place.  And, personally, I rarely have the gumption to write about a large chain unless I find that golden nugget of light that I must share with the world. Cheesecake=Perfection.  Hands down.  I'm usually in the mood for their red velvet cheesecake, or anything chocolate.  I tried the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it came with a foil-wrapped piece of chocolate.  Heavenly.  We typically order cheesecake as a to-go item and here's a little tidbit that I can share with you.  One piece is usually too big for one person.  They'll split it right down the middle and put it in two separate containers with their own dollop of whipped cream.  How 'bout that?! Now, for dinner service.  There are no black napkins to be found in the restaurant, so make sure you're wearing a lighter color or don't care about white lint on your black outfit.  Customer service can tend to be a little spotty.  I attribute this to the vastness of the restaurant.  For food's sake, stick to what you know.  Order whatever your cheesecake factory staple is to make you happy. I was coerced into going off the beaten path and I ordered  their Sunday brunch item which was their crab hash.  The dish looked great, and it came with real crab, but the problem was that it had an unpleasant smoky flavor to it and there was an excess of liquid either from the poached eggs or from the lump crab.  Now I'm the antithesis of a picky eater, and it was hard getting through this meal. The company that I was with had Elvis' belgian waffles all nice and fluffy and clad with peanut butter, banana slices and.....dun dun dunnn....pieces of bacon.  My partner in crime had their healthy man-portion of a Monte Cristo. Here are my menu suggestions if you have NEVER been to a Cheesecake Factory: Tuscan Chicken (off their Skinnylicious menu) -  Grilled Chicken Breast with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers, Fresh Basil and Balsamic Vinaigrette. Served Over Fresh Vegetables and Farro Avocado Egg Rolls - Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. Miso Salmon - Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice and a Delicious Miso Sauce. Chicken Bellagio - Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad Now, go forth and fill those bellies!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=40
Gerry H.,"Naples, FL",0,3,,4.0,3/15/2017,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory in Naples last night for the first time and was favourably impressed, although I found the cocktails overpriced but very good (Mai Tai was $12.50, JW's Pink Lemonade was $11.50). We were a party of 5 and we were seated within 10 minutes. Our server Violeta was very attentive and got all of the orders right, including breaking up the bill into 4 separate checks which was no problem. I had the Shepherd's Pie which was awesome.....very tasty and large portion. My wife had the Crispy Chicken Cosoletta which she said was also very good (3 pieces of chicken). It was too much for her to finish, so we took it home along with the cheesecake that we had to try even though we were more than full. All in all, a great place to eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=40

Anja S.,"Freiberg, Germany",0,4,3,4.0,9/21/2015,My family and I came here twice during our vacation because we enjoyed it so much! During our first visit we tried 3 pieces of cheese cake and could barley finish them with 5 people. Everything tasted awesome and the peanut butter cheesecake send me to peanut heaven. I really recommend trying as much different cakes as possible! During our second stop we came for lunch. The place was really crowded so we had to wait before we could be seated. I really like the variety of food they serve in the cheese cake factory. The lettuce wraps as starters are something you can't get everywhere. I recommend trying them!  Every dish is served lovely and you can see and taste that a lot of thought went into the creation of the dish. I had the California cheese steak sandwich but also loved my moms tacos with the tasty avocado rice. One star less because it gets really noisy if the restaurant is full and you can't understand all the things other people at your table are saying.

Me and my friend we started with a flatbread, with tomato and mozarella, very nice. Afterwards i ordered the Meatloaf, which comes with mashed potatoes and corn ( the best corn!! ), and my friend got the Shepard's Pie, delicious and a million flavors , just like homemade food.

David B.,"Whittier, CA",6,87,106,1.0,4/5/2015,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants because they lack an identity. Usually they are consistent with food quality and service but that was not the case here. My uncle and I ordered nachos and a couple of drinks. The nachos were just ok but I could tell the pico de gallo and guacamole were old and discolored. Bread service was fine here but it took too long for our drinks to arrive. The Cambria Chardonnay they pour by the glass was very good and tasted like the bottle had just been opened.  Dinner was awful. I returned my Chinese chicken salad. The chicken was mealy, the fried garnishes( cellophane noodle and fried wontons) were stale and the salad was over dressed. My uncle's filet mignon was not properly trimmed. They left the chain on the filet so there was silver skin and fat when there should have been none. We had those little filth flies at our table which means they either have standing water somewhere or a trash problem.  The waitress delivered a glass of Pinot Noir wine that had lip stick on it.  She returned to the table with a ""new glass"" too quickly. I told my uncle she either wiped the glass clean or poured his wine into a new glass. He agreed with me and wasn't thrilled with the insight. I ordered plain cheesecake and it was excellent.

My family travels a lot, and given our great experiences here, we frequently visit other locations of the Cheesecake Factory, which are never up to par with ours locally. The service and food at this location are both outstanding. In my 20+ visits, I've never had less than a great experience. For those new to the chain in general, take comfort in the fact that the staff is always open to your questions, and in my experience, the kitchen staff as well has always been great about substitutions for my food allergies. The expansive menu (nearing a hundred items I've heard) also makes a newcomer feel welcome as you will definitely find something for you. My older sister worked at this location for a few years when it first opened and still says years later that it is the only restaurant of the 8+ she's worked at that is near spotless, even in the areas guests wouldn't see (which gains it another star simply for overall cleanliness).

We waited way over 10 minutes just for Kim to come over with our not so great drinks and zero apology for taking so long. So we ordered our salad appetizer and our entrees all at once. We got our salad a couple minutes later which was nice because by this time, we were starving. Soon after, we got our entrees. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it came so rare, that it was literally purple throughout and had more fat on it than meat. Our server asked how everything was, we said it was good only because my salmon was amazing (which is the only reason this review has more than one star) and my boyfriend was starving and didn't want to wait to send it back. She told us she would be right back to fill our waters, never did until the very end when we asked for the check. She wasn't even nice to make up for her horrible service.

The manager glares at me and says, ""Anyone could have helped you with that"" as if I'm a child. Now I want to make this point clear, if I'm telling a manager of a restaurant a situation that I think needs his attention it's not because I'm impolite or I regularly complain about restaurant staff (I used to be a waitress, I get it). I am telling him this because he is in a position to do something about it and make our experience at this establishment better. However, if you dismiss my claims and glare at me for telling you something, do not expect me to ever come back again. Our dinner plates finally arrive another 20 minutes later with the appetizer at the same time. Our waitress seemed to realize we existed after we talked to the manager, but still never refilled our glasses until I asked her to over a hour later. Thankfully the appetizer was taken off our check because it had arrived at the end of the meal, but I still thought the whole thing was atrocious. I have no idea whether training for employees wasn't up to par or general lack of concern on the part of the managerial staff was to blame, but this has been the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to and the worst customer service I have ever received. ----------------------------------------- Update: I received a gift card in the mail for 10$ at any Cheesecake Factory. I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant to come back and have a much better experience. It was very professional of him to take the matter seriously. However, I did not accept the invite when thinking back to that horrible service and cold food. I really hope that some changes were made to improve the establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=80

Dave K.,"Hinsdale, IL",0,18,,1.0,11/27/2014,"Unfortunately an awful experience yesterday. Hoping the management can use this feedback as a training experience.  My son ordered the kids hamburger sliders - these were cooked beyond recognition and tasted really bad.  We ordered the kids chicken strips for my 2 year old - these were hard and tasteless...couldn't even tell they were chicken actually. Both of their French fries were over cooked and hard.    My wife and both ordered the beet and goat cheese salad from the lite menu - the dressing was so incredibly tart it was difficult to force down to the point where I picked out the beets and had to leave all of the lettuce. Shockingly bad salad dressing.  The worst though was the ahi tuna appetizer I had from the lite menu. The tuna used had so much membrane in it, I literally couldn't stomach eating it. As I was looking for my server, the manager caught my eye. I showed him the quality of the fish and said I couldn't eat it. He took it away.  Come bill time, our server never asked how our meal was even though there were full plates for all four of us. I asked her if the manager took my tuna off of the bill - the server didn't know anything about it. I paid anyway and on the way out, we passed the manager. I asked him why he didn't tell the server about our conversation- he said he did, which I told him was a lie as the server obviously wasn't aware. I then asked if he usually would take something inedible off of a bill - he said he usually does but didn't.  So we walked out the door without even an apology. I rarely give bad reviews because I figure everyone can have an off day, but this was SO bad, I couldn't resist and like I wrote at the beginning, I hope management looks into this as the experience hurt the Cheesecake Factory brand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=80

Hand on hip, other hand holding himself up on the back of the booth.

This location is right in front of the Coastland Center Mall.The moment we walked in we were greeted by some jolly lady who seemed to be in a great mood.There was a 45 minute wait but trust me it's worth the wait and by the way we went on a Saturday night.I even remembered who are waitress was his name was Jerry I can't believe I remembered his name but I know why because he was the nicest waiter I've ever had in my life.Our Appetizers were delicious that day we ordered the Luau Salad that was really great.My Cheeseburger with fries were delicious and the S'mores Cheesecake we all ordered was delicious the Happy Hour specials are awesome and the Bartender was amazing I don't remember her name though overall this Naples Cheesecake Factory deserves 5 stars because the bathroom is clean including the whole restaurant,the staff is friendly and the food is delicious if u haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in Naples u should definitely go",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=100

A female manager begins to yell at her staff for something that she has repeated had to tell them. There is a time and place for everything, and that may of been the time but certainly not the place. It is obvious that the staff did not care about the manager or their jobs, because they spent entirely too much time gossiping at the front with one another and little to no attention to their customers.  The food comes out and it is 4 star worthy. No complaints about the food. With 45min remaining before they close, the same Latino female manager starts talking to herself, ""Okay, let's start getting these folks out of here.""  I could tell that she was surprised to see us sitting there in hearing distance.  Now, the real reason was for cheesecake, but now we are so agitated about the service and disrespect, we paid our bill and went and bought ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=100

The service was impeccable, our drinks never got half empty before they were refilled. The food was.. ok.

Despite being charged for extras like ""spicy chicken"" on the house factory nachos and the same on the Mexican tortilla salad TCF still managed to not include them despite being charged for it. And on top of that the food we did get was terrible. How do you make a bad salad? Go to TCF Naples and find out for yourself. Even the $10 slice of cheesecake, which is what the place is named for, was terrible. Does anyone check the quality of the food served there?

Deisy C.,"Lehigh Acres, United States",340,23,136,2.0,16/8/2015,"Tonight we decided on cheese cake factory located at Coastland mall in Naples, fl. The parking was packed and so was the restaurant. We asked for a table for two, our wait would be 25-30 minutes but we ended up scoring a bar room table in less than 10 (I always get lucky with those grab and sit tables! Lol)  We were served water and bread right away but our bread plates didn't show up for at least 20 minutes. We ordered the steak Diane and Herb Salmon combination platter, which is my favorite.  When the food came out my boyfriend and I noticed how uneven both our plates were and how skimpy the steak was. When the waiter asked how everything looked I mentioned our disappointment but it was quickly dismissed with a ""ah well I hope it fills you up"". Everything was mediocre, the salmon had so many herbs and steams on it I had to scrap the top layer off and the steak was dry. I must say I've had better. The waiter passed by but not stopping at our table about 3 or 4 times holding a pitcher of water and not once refilled my water until I was done eating, I ended up having to stand up and grabbing a refill from the bar.

Dara E.,"Smithtown, United States",59,2,,5.0,15/4/2017,"Let me tell you about another experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Our waiter was either named Jack, Jake, or Zack. Despite not knowing his name, I liked him. Let me tell you why I felt this way about him. Everyone who goes to The Cheesecake Factory knows about the beloved brown bread. When I go with my friends, we often take a full loaf for each person. However, we quickly eat it and feel lost and confused, not knowing what to do without our brown bread. My pal and fellow The Cheesecake Factory enthusiast, Courtney, asked our waiter (name still unknown) for another basket of brown bread before he even finished pouring our water. He seemed overwhelmed at our eagerness to obtain more brown bread but quickly delivered his promise. However, we finished the bread once again and it was my turn to ask him for more. After I ordered my veggie burger (without cheese or mayo) I asked for more brown bread. Our waiter (name still not clarified) gave me what I like in a man. I asked him for brown bread and he only gave my brown bread. We got our main course and I was not disappointed, especially in the side of french fries I had the pleasure of consuming. The veggie burger had good flavor, texture, and was overall a good eating experience. As a vegan, I felt out of place watching my friends pick out their preferred cheesecakes. I didn't know how to react to not being able to eat cheesecake but I got through it.

Arlene H.,"Naples, United States",324,130,336,3.0,8/7/2014,"UGH! I'm so torn with how I feel about this place.  And, personally, I rarely have the gumption to write about a large chain unless I find that golden nugget of light that I must share with the world. Cheesecake=Perfection.  Hands down.  I'm usually in the mood for their red velvet cheesecake, or anything chocolate.  I tried the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it came with a foil-wrapped piece of chocolate.  Heavenly.  We typically order cheesecake as a to-go item and here's a little tidbit that I can share with you.  One piece is usually too big for one person.  They'll split it right down the middle and put it in two separate containers with their own dollop of whipped cream.  How 'bout that?! Now, for dinner service.  There are no black napkins to be found in the restaurant, so make sure you're wearing a lighter color or don't care about white lint on your black outfit.  Customer service can tend to be a little spotty.  I attribute this to the vastness of the restaurant.  For food's sake, stick to what you know.  Order whatever your cheesecake factory staple is to make you happy. I was coerced into going off the beaten path and I ordered  their Sunday brunch item which was their crab hash.  The dish looked great, and it came with real crab, but the problem was that it had an unpleasant smoky flavor to it and there was an excess of liquid either from the poached eggs or from the lump crab.  Now I'm the antithesis of a picky eater, and it was hard getting through this meal. The company that I was with had Elvis' belgian waffles all nice and fluffy and clad with peanut butter, banana slices and.....dun dun dunnn....pieces of bacon.  My partner in crime had their healthy man-portion of a Monte Cristo. Here are my menu suggestions if you have NEVER been to a Cheesecake Factory: Tuscan Chicken (off their Skinnylicious menu) -  Grilled Chicken Breast with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers, Fresh Basil and Balsamic Vinaigrette. Served Over Fresh Vegetables and Farro Avocado Egg Rolls - Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. Miso Salmon - Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice and a Delicious Miso Sauce.

Afterwards i ordered the Meatloaf, which comes with mashed potatoes and corn ( the best corn!! ), and my friend got the Shepard's Pie, delicious and a million flavors , just like homemade food.

Usually they are consistent with food quality and service but that was not the case here. My uncle and I ordered nachos and a couple of drinks. The nachos were just ok but I could tell the pico de gallo and guacamole were old and discolored. Bread service was fine here but it took too long for our drinks to arrive. The Cambria Chardonnay they pour by the glass was very good and tasted like the bottle had just been opened.  Dinner was awful. I returned my Chinese chicken salad. The chicken was mealy, the fried garnishes( cellophane noodle and fried wontons) were stale and the salad was over dressed. My uncle's filet mignon was not properly trimmed. They left the chain on the filet so there was silver skin and fat when there should have been none. We had those little filth flies at our table which means they either have standing water somewhere or a trash problem.  The waitress delivered a glass of Pinot Noir wine that had lip stick on it.  She returned to the table with a ""new glass"" too quickly. I told my uncle she either wiped the glass clean or poured his wine into a new glass. He agreed with me and wasn't thrilled with the insight. I ordered plain cheesecake and it was excellent.

The service and food at this location are both outstanding. In my 20+ visits, I've never had less than a great experience. For those new to the chain in general, take comfort in the fact that the staff is always open to your questions, and in my experience, the kitchen staff as well has always been great about substitutions for my food allergies. The expansive menu (nearing a hundred items I've heard) also makes a newcomer feel welcome as you will definitely find something for you. My older sister worked at this location for a few years when it first opened and still says years later that it is the only restaurant of the 8+ she's worked at that is near spotless, even in the areas guests wouldn't see (which gains it another star simply for overall cleanliness).

We waited way over 10 minutes just for Kim to come over with our not so great drinks and zero apology for taking so long. So we ordered our salad appetizer and our entrees all at once. We got our salad a couple minutes later which was nice because by this time, we were starving. Soon after, we got our entrees. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it came so rare, that it was literally purple throughout and had more fat on it than meat. Our server asked how everything was, we said it was good only because my salmon was amazing (which is the only reason this review has more than one star) and my boyfriend was starving and didn't want to wait to send it back. She told us she would be right back to fill our waters, never did until the very end when we asked for the check. She wasn't even nice to make up for her horrible service.

My boyfriend and I got seated and waited for 25 minutes for the waitress to finally come over and take our order for an appetizer and drinks (keep in mind we had no drinks or bread). We wait another 10 minutes and she brings one water to the table. We had ordered two waters since there are TWO people, but... Whatever. We ordered our dinner plates at this point. Another 20 minutes pass and our appetizer arrives with my boyfriend's water. We take a bite of the Crispy Taquitos and they are cold and chewy. Our waitress is nowhere to be seen since she last gave us our water and hasn't refilled it once. I noticed a manager walking by our table and asked him if we could please get another appetizer since ours was cold and practically uncooked. He grabbed the plate and walked away. Another 20 minutes pass and the waitress is still nowhere to be found. My boyfriend and I have been sitting at this table for over a hour waiting for any type of food to be served or our drinks to be refilled and I was getting a little annoyed. I noticed another manager walking by and told him what the situation was (omitting the waitress being MIA because I didn't want to get her in trouble... Though her customer service was nonexistent). The manager glares at me and says, ""Anyone could have helped you with that"" as if I'm a child. Now I want to make this point clear, if I'm telling a manager of a restaurant a situation that I think needs his attention it's not because I'm impolite or I regularly complain about restaurant staff (I used to be a waitress, I get it). I am telling him this because he is in a position to do something about it and make our experience at this establishment better. However, if you dismiss my claims and glare at me for telling you something, do not expect me to ever come back again. Our dinner plates finally arrive another 20 minutes later with the appetizer at the same time. Our waitress seemed to realize we existed after we talked to the manager, but still never refilled our glasses until I asked her to over a hour later. Thankfully the appetizer was taken off our check because it had arrived at the end of the meal, but I still thought the whole thing was atrocious. I have no idea whether training for employees wasn't up to par or general lack of concern on the part of the managerial staff was to blame, but this has been the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to and the worst customer service I have ever received. ----------------------------------------- Update: I received a gift card in the mail for 10$ at any Cheesecake Factory. I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant to come back and have a much better experience. It was very professional of him to take the matter seriously. However, I did not accept the invite when thinking back to that horrible service and cold food. I really hope that some changes were made to improve the establishment.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=80

Dave K.,"Hinsdale, United States",0,18,,1.0,27/11/2014,"Unfortunately an awful experience yesterday. Hoping the management can use this feedback as a training experience.  My son ordered the kids hamburger sliders - these were cooked beyond recognition and tasted really bad.  We ordered the kids chicken strips for my 2 year old - these were hard and tasteless...couldn't even tell they were chicken actually. Both of their French fries were over cooked and hard.    My wife and both ordered the beet and goat cheese salad from the lite menu - the dressing was so incredibly tart it was difficult to force down to the point where I picked out the beets and had to leave all of the lettuce. Shockingly bad salad dressing.  The worst though was the ahi tuna appetizer I had from the lite menu. The tuna used had so much membrane in it, I literally couldn't stomach eating it. As I was looking for my server, the manager caught my eye. I showed him the quality of the fish and said I couldn't eat it. He took it away.  Come bill time, our server never asked how our meal was even though there were full plates for all four of us. I asked her if the manager took my tuna off of the bill - the server didn't know anything about it. I paid anyway and on the way out, we passed the manager. I asked him why he didn't tell the server about our conversation- he said he did, which I told him was a lie as the server obviously wasn't aware. I then asked if he usually would take something inedible off of a bill - he said he usually does but didn't.  So we walked out the door without even an apology. I rarely give bad reviews because I figure everyone can have an off day, but this was SO bad, I couldn't resist and like I wrote at the beginning, I hope management looks into this as the experience hurt the Cheesecake Factory brand.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=80

Micah C.,"San Clemente, United States",3,32,2,2.0,27/10/2009,it is usually pretty good... but this time it was a mes. maybe it was the fact that 15 minutes after ordering our sandwiches and salads that  we had to remind our absent-minded waiter to put in our order.   10 minutes later we got our caesar salads.... the dressing was bitter and hardly a hint of anchovies :( (my sweetie's fav)    another 10 minutes later i recieve my cold-cut turkey club and she gets her portobello sandwich.... wait a sec! that's not what she ordered :(   another 10 minutes later my UNHAPPY and HUNGRY sweetie finally gets the eggplant sandwich she ordered.   i was disappointed with the food. turkey was boring and the eggplant mushy and chewy all at the same time. the waiter was full of excuses... but the pros were that the manager graciously comp'd her sandwich... which i still had to remind our waiter to take off the initial billing attempt the atmosphere was pleasant and i'm sure the cheesecake is to die for... but we couldn't take any more disappointment and excuses,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=120
Brook B.,"Naples, United States",0,5,,1.0,28/5/2012,I love The Cheesecake factory but this experience was horrible!!! Every piece of silverwear on our table was dirty. I'm talking filthy! Then when we told our waitress she had an attitude like we were wasting her time! Even the two tables around us were complaining of dirty silverwear. This was a discusting experience today!

Jason N.,"Shelby Township, United States",0,1,,1.0,25/5/2015,"Well, the so-called ""manager"" Scott lived up to his name tonight. And by that I mean his attitude was as shitty as Scott Toilet Paper. We got there and there was water on our booth seats and on our table. We told our hostess and she handed us a napkin to clean it up ourselves. Unless you plan on giving me a paycheck at the end of the night it's not MY job to properly bust YOUR tables. Okay great, here comes our appetizer salad to put this little mishap behind us  and enjoy. As I go to put some pepper on it the top falls off into my salad, putting a mountain of pepper and the metal top into my salad. Our waitress was very nice about it (her and our entrées were the only positives tonight), and got her manager as I had asked. Here comes Scott. Hand on hip, other hand holding himself up on the back of the booth. Explained to him the problems we experienced and he sat there staring at us with the urgency of a sloth to respond and offer us the customer service a real manager should. No free salad, no percentage off the bill, just a pissy attitude and a fine showing of sub-par managerial skills. Scott, you can't provide people with delicious food and shit customer service and expect them to come back. We sure won't.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=100

The pasta was unreal I ate all of that first. The Marsala wine sauce was just so delicious and that was all over the pasta and chicken, the chicken was so tender I could slightly put my fork down to cut it up.

This location is right in front of the Coastland Center Mall.The moment we walked in we were greeted by some jolly lady who seemed to be in a great mood.There was a 45 minute wait but trust me it's worth the wait and by the way we went on a Saturday night.I even remembered who are waitress was his name was Jerry I can't believe I remembered his name but I know why because he was the nicest waiter I've ever had in my life.Our Appetizers were delicious that day we ordered the Luau Salad that was really great.My Cheeseburger with fries were delicious and the S'mores Cheesecake we all ordered was delicious the Happy Hour specials are awesome and the Bartender was amazing I don't remember her name though overall this Naples Cheesecake Factory deserves 5 stars because the bathroom is clean including the whole restaurant,the staff is friendly and the food is delicious if u haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in Naples u should definitely go",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=100

Wrong choice, I ordered the Factory Burrito Grande and it was not tasty at all. The size of the Burrito was true to the name on the menu, for it was truly a big size. even though it was a big size, I would have been more pleased if it was a lesser size and packed with more flavor packed seasonings.

Jason D.,"Rocky Mt, United States",39,34,2,1.0,11/9/2013,"Naples is notorious of closing up early, so wife and I were pleased that The Cheesecake Factory stayed open later.  We arrived 1hr and 45min before closing. The main reason we came here was for the cheesecake, but wanted to first have a meal.  We were promptly greeted and lead to our seats. The waitress finally asked for our drink orders 5 min later and never asked about an appetizer, which we had to flag her down and request. A female manager begins to yell at her staff for something that she has repeated had to tell them. There is a time and place for everything, and that may of been the time but certainly not the place. It is obvious that the staff did not care about the manager or their jobs, because they spent entirely too much time gossiping at the front with one another and little to no attention to their customers.  The food comes out and it is 4 star worthy. No complaints about the food. With 45min remaining before they close, the same Latino female manager starts talking to herself, ""Okay, let's start getting these folks out of here.""  I could tell that she was surprised to see us sitting there in hearing distance.  Now, the real reason was for cheesecake, but now we are so agitated about the service and disrespect, we paid our bill and went and bought ice cream.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-naples?start=100

I have to say the value for the buck I got from the one in Chicago made me check out the one down here. I was truly impressed by both locations.  The food tastes great and its cheap. Also it fills the plate not like one of those places where you pay $50 for food that takes 2 sq inches of your plate.  I tried the Teryaki Chicken and Ceaser Salad.

I say briefly because 3 servers passed on the opportunity to serve me. Initially, at 7:30 pm on Thursday, I asked to sit outside and was denied because they'd stopped serving outside. So, I sat at a hightop in the bar area. First server asked me if the bartender (Ross or Russ) had helped me yet. I said no. Then he asked me if Tiffany had helped me. Again, I said no. Then he yelled to Tiffany that she had a table and she replied that she already had 6 tables. She then attempted to ask the bartender to serve my table because she was too busy, and he said no because he had to use the restroom. (Mind you, I was alone...just ONE person and all I wanted was cheesecake and coffee.) This ALL happened right in front of me. I heard every word. Obviously, I got up and left.

Especially great for large groups. I have been sort of avoiding it because I like to try all the ""local"" spots, but we ducked in here after some Christmas shopping, I almost fell over when we were seated in 5 mins ( on a Saturday night!!!) I have always had to wait at least an hour or more in other places.  Our waitress was awesome, the food was delicious, creative and I was eating  ( good!)  Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane for $19.00. Not 50 bucks, so you have to love that. We did the cheesecake too of course, always yummy. They do have outdoor seating , however it overlooks the mall parking lot,  so no on that...I always think the insides of these are really pretty though. Good comfortable tables & booths.
