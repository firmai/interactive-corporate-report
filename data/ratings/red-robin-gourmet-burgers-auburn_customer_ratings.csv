They used to wrap them in a napkin. They don't anymore. They used to add a crisp piece of lettuce, an onion with some bite, and a slice or two of fresh tomato. They don't anymore. Now it is shredded lettuce, pieces of tomato and onion in name only. The burger itself used to be a juicy piece of meat. Now the patty is big enough but comes with the life cooked out of it. The fries used to be big steak fries but now they are just shards of steak fries but you can still have as many as you want. On leaving the waitress asked if I had had enough. I had to say yes.

Sometimes I think my expectations are perhaps a little high for what this chain restaurant is capable. The bad first- The service is always hit or miss. Sometimes you get an energetic and engaging server on a slow night and everything goes smoothly. Sometimes you get a burnt out server at the end of a double shift with a full section.  Now, the good- The food is consistently decent. The ""gourmet"" in their name might be misleading. Yes, they have bot traditional and funky burger creations with interesting flavors, but don't expect Iberico ham or duck eggs. The ambience is good for kids. My little one can stare for hours at the nostalgia on the walls and even when it's busy I never feel like it's terribly loud. Oh yeah- Bottomless fries.

85,Nam N.,"Renton, WA",677,804,135.0,2.0,2014-01-11,"i'm deducting a star for Red Robin in general - They used to be a fan place to grab a burger, bottomless fries, and kind of care free fun.  In the recent months of my coming back, I've noticed numerous changes.  The menu is becoming more ""fancy"" as it's a booklet style similar to Cheesecake Factory.  The bottomless basket of fries is now a metal cylinder with no bottom that typically holds about 10 fries at best.  The (my personal former favorite) Royal Red Robin Burger is now served as an ""open face burger"" and the egg is cooked over easy contrary to the original over hard.  Red Robin no longer carries Tabasco but as switched over to Cholula.  The overall quality of the burger and fries seemed to have gone down a touch while prices have jumped about 50 cents. Call me old school and a bit nostalgic for things of the past but I enjoyed getting my burger and fries in a basket.  It's more comfortable and fun.  I don't care to pay a little more to make things look fancy on a plate.  Red Robin prior to changes had some of the best steak fries around!  Now in my last two visits, they've been a little soggy and just small end pieces that are either soggy or over cooked.   Burgers have different breads that I wasn't aware of.  And why can't my egg still be cooked over hard?  Over easy is the only option you have, I personally don't like yoke dripping off my burger when I eat, you don't taste the egg anymore. Freckled lemonades used to be full of strawberries now you're lucky to get more than a few chunks and it seems more watered down as well. Cholula is NOT hot sauce.  It's tangy.  I know it's a matter of personal preference but I miss the hot heat spice of Tabasco.  Why not have a choice?  Why make it one or the other?? I could only guess this is corporate's way of cutting costs by switching to a different brand of hot sauce, lessening the amount of fries in front of people so non-burger orders cannot share bottomless fries by limiting how many is served at a time and to slow down people literally eating all the fries they can.  Also raising the prices by a small margin of 50 cents won't deter a consumer from eating but definitely pays for the revamp of the new menus and the plates the food comes on as well as boosts profit margins. /rant.

We ordered our food and I ordered a side of buzz sauce and parmesan cheese. I didn't receive the parmesan cheese so I waited until our server came by to ask but she didn't drop our food off so she was nowhere to be found. About ten minutes went by and she finally came to check on us. I reminded her about my side that was forgotten and she disappeared for about 15 more minutes. Finally returned with two half full sides of it. By then my drink was empty. She ran off before I could ask for a refill. Finally when she came back, we asked for refills and then she brought me two diet cokes in a row, when I ordered regular coke. I was trying to be polite and courteous, because it seemed to me that she was new. For that reason, I won't say her name. But I think better training needs to happen or something.. Or don't leave new employees to themselves until they're comfortable. Anyways, when I told her that my second coke was in fact diet, she argued with me and said it was not diet. Mmmkay. So since it was my boyfriends birthday, she said he'd get a birthday sundae which he also never got. We ordered the dessert and asked to have it as soon as it was ready, but we had to ask for it three times after we were long finished with our food. Overall- I would give them another shot because everyone can have an off day, but I was seriously disappointed when we went out for what should've been a relaxing birthday lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=140,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.732,2.8

131,Kelly L.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,1,,1.0,2016-02-28,"This is a difficult review to write because I have always enjoyed Red Robin in the past.  But our last visit earlier this week was very disappointing.  We were seated quickly in the newly refurbished dinning room which I thought was a big improvement from the busy Americana theme. The feel of the new dining room is really the only reason why I gave them two stars. It ends there. I'm going to begin my rant by saying I can't stand the video monitors at every table. Is this really necessary? Most of us spend way too much time in front of our smart phones, iPads, video games and televisions.  Of course, my children were drawn to the video monitors immediately. I put the stupid thing on one of our empty chairs. My next gripe was the ridiculous bells and buzzers going off in the kitchen constantly.  And the buzzer didn't ring for 5 - 10 seconds. No, the darn things kept going all night for 30 seconds at a time, not to mention they were very loud. No reason to have the alarms going off like that continuely, no matter how many french fries they're frying.  Then there was the manager standing directly behind me going over the nights staffing level and floor seating grid. I turned around because I was in shock they were talking so loud, so close.  The manager saw me turn around and look at them, "" Oh, sorry folks"" and continued on with their discussion. The serve reached across myself and my daughter to serve the two other meals. Really? Take two steps around the person and place the plates directly in front of each person. Terribly rude to reach in front of people. Had to ask for refills on ice tea, drinks more fries. I was beside myself by the time I walked out of the restaurant. Unfortunately, it will be awhile until I go back to RR, and definitely not the Auburn location. So disappointing because I really use to think  their customer service was on par for that kind of restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=120,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.6360000000000001,3.0000000000000004

150,Pat D.,"Auburn, WA",0,57,,2.0,2016-03-02,"I'm giving this Red Robin in Auburn, WA a low rating.  There is no happy hour, no serior discount and there are only 5 mediocre beers on tap.  The beer is a little over priced.  On the bright side, the food (I had the french dip, my husband a salad) was good.  The things that came as side items were not great.  For example, the garlic toast was cold and soggy.  I could have used more juice for the sandwich, but by the time the waitress delivered it, the french dip sandwich had to be eaten dry.  It seems like they are going cheap on some things.  For example, there are no coasters for the beer mugs and we ended up having to use our dinner napkins to sop up the wet.  We had to borrow salt from another table which was embarrassing. We were in the bar area and it seemed a little chilly.  I wore my jacket through the meal and looking around, I saw other people wearing theirs.  Restaurants should be cozy and comfortable.  They had this computer on the table and we were encouraged to play games (for a fee), order and pay on the thing.  One way to cut staff and generate some money.  Also, I was sitting on a high bench against the wall, which kept wiggling around and I was afraid it was going to dump me.  The noise level was OK, however, and we did not have to scream at each other over sports or music.  For two and a half beers, a french dip and a salad, plan to spend about $55.  For a $55 meal, we left with more complaints and disappointment than compliments..  We will not be coming back here.  There are better places in Auburn.  I don't know if all the Red Robins are this way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=140,3.04,3.04,3.04,1.6400000000000001,3.0400000000000005

We came here for dinner once on a Friday night around 7, so it was super busy. I got my refills on my lemonade without having to ask, and our food was out within 30 min. This is when Thaddeus served us. The next time we went (today,) was a Sunday night and there were only a few tables filled with about 6 waiters on duty (more than one waiter per table.) At first, our waitress was friendly and brought our drinks right away. After we ordered is when the service went to shit. We waited over an HOUR for our food on a slow Sunday night when they were overstaffed and when it finally came to us, it wasn't even fresh. My burger was luke warm, the fries were burnt and old, and my boyfriends bun was hard. I ate about half of my burger (I usually eat all of it, but I was hungry so I ate some) and my boyfriend had like one bite of his. We didn't even have napkins and silverware brought to us until I had to ask the waitress for them after we got our food, ate some of it, and made a mess. We also had to ask twice for buzzard sauce, and the waitress never once apologized for the food taking so long (even though it's not her fault.) On top of all of this, after I asked for the buzzard sauce for the second time, the waitress dropped a menu and (jokingly) blamed it on me. I realize she was trying to be funny, but I definitely don't think it's appropriate to joke like that when you know the customers are already upset and have been waiting for their food for an hour. I realize red robin isn't exactly gourmet, but I expect the food to be fresh, arrive in a timely manner, and have professional wait staff.

I assumed it was just a fluke, so forgave the situation entirely. Second time (2 weeks later)... Called at 4:10 to place an order. They said it would be ready in 10 mins.... I finally got my order at 4:35pm. 25 mins later!!! While I was waiting for my order, I sat next to this guy in the bar who was waiting for a beer for over 10 minutes. He had a dirty plate in front of him from the last customer, and the bartender was just counting money with her back faced to the bar the entire time. She didn't even turn around once to see if anyone needed anything. As you can imagine, everyone is sitting at the bar with empty glasses, like WTF?? Finally she turns around, and without a single apology, she asks with an attitude, ""what do you want to drink?"".... The guy next to me orders a beer, and looks over at me and says ""I didn't realize I was such an inconvenience around here"". That sucks. So finally my to-go order is ready, (25 minutes late)... I get home, and it's the wrong order. The receipt even says guac burger... And I have a turkey burger. Again, I call the manager to let them know what bad service is being provided at their restaurant... And I talk with Alex again. And again, Alex could care less.

Sad.   We were taken back to a platform table in the back of the restaurant where I needed a high chair. Little do they understand, is that when the high chair is placed at the table, it's about 6-8inches away and my child won't be able to reach the table. When I asked for a 'regular height' table, I was given the death glare and the hostess walked away. Granted, she looked like someone off the street. No uniform, and clearly no manners.  I ordered a bbq chicken wrap with no cheese, and fries. My son ordered the chicken stickens with mandarin oranges. When the food arrived after 25 minutes (my son was not happy by then), I noticed that my wrap tasted funny. I knew what was missing, the ranch/sour cream they put in the wrap. She almost acted like she knew it was missing, went over and got a dish of ranch and said sorry. Uhh...this was made wrong.

From the time we were seated it took 35 minutes for our drinks and 45 for our food. Our fries were cold and mushy, burger cold and greasy. My daughter asked for a side order of fries and the server made sure to tell her that since she didn't order a meal, policy says the fries are not ""bottomless"". Ummm, they were cold to start with so ok?! Both men's and women's bathrooms had trash cans overflowing, toilet paper out and water all over the floors.

My draft beer was also ok, but seems a bit watered down or the taps just need a little cleaning. My southern charm burger had amazing flavours. Bacon was sweet, and the onion topping was flavourful. The burger itself, kind dry. Overall, burger was OK. The dry meet kinda threw me off. Fries were OK.  -mild ranting and thoughts- Servers were very apologetic and tried their best to address some issues we had (late food, late drinks, etc). These things happen, so I'm pretty good about that, especially when it's a full house. So that's good. However, it was not busy, so why are you putting your servers in this position to begin with? There was a problem with communication between patron and staff. Please look into this.  Please remove the one centre table that is closest to the kitchen. It creates a narrow high traffic laneway for your server and guests to walk through. When your servers need to float drinks and food over the guests' head to get to the other side of the room, that's a problem. Your restaurant is not at capacity, consider using your space effectively.  $2 entertainment fee for the tablet/menu/game? Tablet sitting on the table, not being used by anyone. Your innovation should be used elsewhere. Don't find new reasons to charge your patrons. Period.  As noted by other reviewers, clean the tables in a timely manner. Doesn't have to be immediately, but...maybe within 30mins. Consider hiring a busser.  -rant over- Red Robbin is usually a pretty consistent and well run company.

However, the potato wedges I ate today were quite a disappointment. The larger fries were soggy, and the broken pieces were rock hard.   The restaurant itself was loud and crowded, overflowing with staff running about but not seeming to be doing much to help with the masses waiting to eat.  If the restaurant's goal was to create a crazy atmosphere, they succeeded.  My fellow diners and I were seated at a tiny booth next to the kitchen.  Not only was there a large open space looking into the kitchen about head height next to me, during the entire meal we could not hear ourselves speak due to the loud sounds and voices coming from the kitchen.  When I curiously peeked in, it was cluttered- stacks of bowls and plates of salad covered the counters.   Several minutes after being seated, our waitress brought the three of us two forks and one knife.  It took a long while for our food to come, and once we were served, our waitress only stopped by once to check up on us and, although our drinks were low, did not refill them until we were leaving.  When she brought us our bill, we were ready to pay almost instantly, but couldn't find the waitress anywhere.  After about ten more minutes, we managed to pay and leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=80,1.88,2.65,2.65,1.736,2.342

We put our name in- and watched them type in our name and indicate +1 high chair. They said 25-30 mins, so we took a seat right up front by the host stand.  Around 35 mins goes by, and I have to take the hungry/grumpy kids outside because they're so restless. The rest of our group stays inside, right in front of the host stand. The hosts never thought to ask why we were standing there, or for how long.  Finally, after almost an hour, someone from my group asks them why they keep seating groups who got there way after us-- they try to tell us that we weren't on the list...Too bad 3 of us saw her type our name in. When they finally realized their error, They didn't seem too bothered by it, and sat us soon after.  It may seem like a quick fix, but we waited there for 35 minutes longer than we should have-- and by that point, the kids were wiped out. Sort of ruined the dinner.

He brought my coffee, but no spoon to stir creamer/sugar. I used my fork, but had asked for spoon........nothing. It was taking some time (20 mins) to get our salads but finally arrived. 30 seconds later our entrees showed up by another server.  I asked that they be taken back and kept warm as we just got our appetizer salads.  He took it back to kitchen area. 2 minutes later, the manager brings entrees back out.  I asked if he was the manager, he said yes. I asked why he was bringing out our entrees a 2nd time when we had just got our salads and asked to have them taken back to keep warm. FYI RED ROBIN STAFF  appetizer defn: a small dish of food served BEFORE the main part of a meal.  In most restaurants salads are served first and after finished, the entree is brought out but not here.  Manager apologized and said he would have new orders made up. I asked for a spoon for my coffee which Bryan still had not brought. He said he'd get it. Nothing came.  Our entrees were brought out. The bun was off to the side so I started to align and realized that the egg white on top was uncooked and raw.  WTF?  FYI RED ROBIN STAFF Over easy definition, (of fried eggs) turned over when nearly done and fried briefly on the reverse side so that the yolk remains somewhat liquid but with a thin firm layer on top (NOT RUNNY WHITE SLIME RUNNING DOWN THE BURGER!!!) Manager came back over and asked if everything was ok, I said no, the egg white slime is running all over and it certainly wasn't cooked over easy, it was sunny side up.  I like a soft yolk, not a 1/2 raw egg.  I also pointed out that I was still waiting on the spoon for my coffee (now cold). He asked, ""Didn't he bring it out?"" If he had.....I wouldn't be asking for one.   He said he'd get one, 2nd time and he'd take care of the egg.   So I got to watch my wife eat her California chicken while I had to wait again for my entree.  I'm not sure they remade the burger but only recooked the egg as the burger was cold when I got it but at least the egg white wasn't running all over. I was so hungry at that point, I didn't care.  Bryan finally brought spoon and I pointed out that 1 of Chipolte sauce didn't taste spicy. It was visibly different than the spicy one, maybe it was 1000 island dressing.  He said he'd go switch it out.  It was taking quite some time & I thought maybe they had to make a new batch? My coffee ran dry and although Bryan walked by a couple of times and I put cup to edge of table, he didn't offer to refill. I had to walk back to kitchen to ask where I found him just chatting with other waiters.  He brought back coffee and I inquired about the Chipolte.  He said, he thought I'd just wanted it sent back. He said he'd bring it out, I said don't bother as we were done.  Nice timing though.  Manager took 20% off the bill, for my trouble, but won't be back here again. My wife said she even told the Bryan it was my birthday so they'd bring out desert and sing Happy Birthday. That didn't happen either.

10,Robin W.,"Auburn, WA",20,50,33.0,1.0,2017-04-04,Went here for lunch on a Monday afternoon so it was not busy at all.  I was really wanting a burger and it was a toss up between five guys and here...should of went with five guys. Was seated by the hostess and waited about 15 minutes before our waitress came she took our drink order and returned about 10 minutes later.  We placed our meal order being very simple 2 burgers I opted for the mac n cheese burger and guest got a smokehouse burger.  We waited another 30 minutes for our food to come out and had to flag down waitress to refill water n beverages. Finally our food....we recieved cold fries which I had to send back and ask for fresh ones and burgers were dry n lack any flavour I choose not to send my burger back due to the time ive already spent in this establishment for the crap they put on the table at this point I was just trying to leave. This by far the worst red robins ive been to..the people who work here need to be retrained.  When we were exiting our table we had another server come introduce herself like we had jus sat down and she was ready to take our order keep in mind the table was full of dirty dishes etc as we were done eating. You would think that on a slow monday a establishment known for burgers could of at least produced good burger and some hot fries...really not asking for alot.

We waited a hugely long time for food. I asked for a refill on my drink (after it sat empty several times when the server came over) and the guy who asked if I need a refill (not our server) and was never to be seen again. After another longer wait, my server got it for me. Server asked us if we wanted more fries right after our food was delivered. We never got them. Actually she mentioned them several times and ""would be right back with them"" and 20+ minutes after her 3rd time of doing that (which we never saw her in that 20 minutes), she brought them to us as we were walking out. I should have taken the basket to my car and snacked on them on the way home.  Not impressed.

After ordering a large party arrived and was seated next to us, mind you by this point we had already  asked for our fries early. My son had ordered a soda which never came. While we continually waited for even our fry basket to arrive the large party had been served appetizers and drinks. We had to ask for my sons drink three times before it finally arrived. I get that it's busy especially on Holidays but you can't forget the small parties, they are your clients too. All that said the manager stepped up and started handing our table. Suddenly things were happening, we got our food, and our experience greatly improved. The food was good as always and they were attentive to a party members food allergies. What started off as a negative experience was made right and I can appreciate that. The manager also discounted our meal because of the delays. My only suggestion would be to offer more assistance to servers handing sections with multiple large parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-auburn?start=80,1.88,2.45,2.45,2.032,2.2220000000000004

We should have seen the writing on the wall when the Red Robin HQ decided to ""re-brand"". That was really the beginning of the downfall. RR used to be built on great customer service. You knew the wait staff would bust their ass to give you a great eating experience. Not any more. A ten minute wait is common now after you are seated to hear from your server. Refills rarely happen. It seems like every person on the staff just started and they aren't sure how to do their job.  I really wish my kids didn't like the mac and cheese so much so I didn't have to come here any more. It has become a tradition that we go to RR for their birthday, but the staff last night didn't seem to really care about the Happy Birthday song, which is lame. RR used to be about service and great food. Now even the food has fallen off a bit. Going to avoid this place as much as possible.

51,Lisa D.,"Enumclaw, WA",29,33,,2.0,2017-07-25,"This is specific to a recent dining experience in Auburn. We had a server that was clearly overwhelmed and frazzled. There was a large birthday party going on and this seemed to be the main cause of her stress. She approached our table, (we had been sitting down for about 3 minutes), and told us that we needed to hurry up and order our food because of the birthday party going on...and that she'd take care of the drinks later. She even said....""hurry, hurry, hurry"". I was a little shocked, but most of us knew what we wanted so we tried to accommodate. One of the kids in our group had a hard time deciding, so she approached him and talked him into getting the chicken strips. She had the same urgency when she got our drink order. We got our food. The food was really good. That is the positive I am taking from this dining experience.Then she came over and proceeded  to tell us that the large birthday party table didn't have their food yet and it was a good thing that we ordered in a hurry. (I actually think that she thought she was practicing good customer service, which is shocking to be honest. )When we got our check, I asked her if I could just use the kiosk and she proceeded to show me how to use it, (completing the survey for me, btw), even though I told her three times that I already knew how to use it. She hovered over me the entire time I payed the bill. I contemplated emailing the manager, but I cant find any contact information in the site. There are plenty of Red Robins in the area.

The ceramic square ""bowls"" they use for soup are too shallow to keep soup hot and three times I've gotten lukewarm clam chowder. This last time it must have sat for awhile because there was a filmy coating across the top where the soup had dried out. Yuck. What's up with the BLTA?

Which wasn't too bad considering the number of people waiting. While in the lobby we witnessed the two hostesses bickering, eye rolling and trash talking about each other to co workers. After about 30 minutes of waiting, a seat opened up in the bar so we seated ourselves. Our waitress was rude from the start. We were a complete bother to her. We all ordered pub burgers and one of my friends ordered a salad. The salad was slid across the table by our waitress without a word, as she went by. It was impossible for my friend to eat her salad because we had no silverware at our table. Our waitress had seemingly disappeared. We flagged down another waitress for silverware. Which was brought by our waitress, who had  reappeared, and delivered with an eye roll. Only for us to look and find that we has been brought dirty silverware. Literally looked like it had been cleared off a table and brought to us. We flagged her down, yet again, asking for clean silverware. Other eye roll. Five minutes later, we were brought what seemed to be the same silverware, plus the fingerprints where someone had tried to rub off the food.  Now comes our burgers, flung onto the table. Mind you, my friend is now eating her salad with her fingers. We have been in the restaurant over an hour by this point. The burgers looked like someone had put them together by throwing food onto the bun, sloppy! I took 3 bites of mine before biting into grizzle. At which point, we had already gotten our check flung onto the table. So disgusted and still hungry, we left the exact amount due with not a penny of a tip and left!!

Auburn however, was the worst I've ever experienced at a Red Robin. While the restaurant was fairly busy with Christmas shopping, we only had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table, but then sat for over an hour waiting for our meal. We would have been more understanding, but the food was warm/cold by the time it got to us. Anything we asked for took forever to happen or never did happen at all. The table next to us came in a good 45 minutes after us and had their appetizers within minutes and their meals shortly after. Fortunately for them, they had a different server. We finally got tired of waiting and asked another waitress to help with a couple things and she was right on it. She apologized for our waiter as he was new and had to deal with 8 tables. While I understand he might have been overwhelmed, he spent most of his time in the food service area, not out on the floor taking care of customers like the rest of the help. At one point, after receiving cold food after waiting an hour, I went to complain to another staff member. All I could find that wasn't another wait staff was the hostess. I told her about our issues, and she told me she she wasn't the manager and couldn't do anything about it. She said she could get a manager, but after her initial response, I was totally disgusted and told her to never mind. To finally top it off, we used the EMV to pay and sure enough, there was no receipt paper. Figures. Now coming to yelp, I see that Yelp reviewers have given this an average of 2.5 stars.
