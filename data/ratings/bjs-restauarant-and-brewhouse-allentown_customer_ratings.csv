107,Kelly B.,"Macungie, PA",9,341,7.0,3.0,2016-08-18,"The newest restaurant to Hamilton Crossing, has been packed since it opened. We went on the 2nd day for dinner. This is a West Coast chain and we have been to one on the West Coast prior to dining here. The decor here is very ""warehouse loft"" style. The service is very good, as presently they have experienced West Coast employees following them around, to make sure everything goes smoothly. Hopefully this won't change, after the trainers head back West. The menu has a good variety, but still very average food. They are more known for being a Brewhouse, with various beers available. There is also a full bar that offers mixed drinks and wines. I did notice 4 garage doors hanging, with tracks to be pulled down. So guessing one side could be semi-closed off for larger groups. I do suggest you down load their App, so that you can place your name on the seating list ahead of time. You can also order take out and pay from the App.  Foodies may not be impressed, but if tired of the same old places, this is worth checking out. Definitely go, if you want to try new beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004
96,Jason W.,"Alburtis, PA",2,7,,5.0,2016-08-18,Love this chain. Been to a few in Florida during family vacations and super excited that this has opened up right down the road their menue is quite large but I haven't found a dish I would never ordered again. Thier beer is also average to great for any beer geek to enjoy and I see this as my new watering hole in the Lehigh valley.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=80,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005
30,Nathan W.,"Allentown, PA",33,2,1.0,3.0,2016-08-20,"It's going to take a little time.  The staff was very friendly except one frustrated sounding young man excusing himself as he was trying to do something with the floor mats near the entrance when I arrived to the very busy location around 5:45 on a Saturday. This is the stores first week open to the public so it's understandable that things will need to get sorted. I sat at the bar and the bar staff was excellent, friendly but hard at work turning out a considerable number of their specialty cocktails and glasses of their full line of house brand beers. The bartender in my immediate vicinity took a few moments to suggest their taster flights, four tasters around 5oz. each. He was right, it's a good and affordable way to familiarize yourself with their line. I found all of the eight I tasted to be very palatable, the hopstorm IPA was pretty impressive.  I ordered the 14oz. ribeye medium well with their signature white cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts. Here's where the learning curve was a little off. The first steak came out medium well and I politely asked if I could get it with a little red or pink left in the center. The manager brought out my re-fired steak and was very kind about the situation, however this steak was a much less marbled cut and noticeably tougher as I cut into it. This time it was very rare, sporting a cool red center. The manager took it back to the kitchen for one more go around. When it came back medium well with a good size chunk missing I didn't have the heart to say anything but thank you. It's going to take some time for the kitchen to get the hang of things, but this place is loaded with potential. Several guests near me had the ribs and jambalaya and were very satisfied with their selections. I should add that during one of the do over waits a bartender offered me a bowl of soup and the calm chowder is spectacular. Also the cheddar mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were very good.  I was a little surprised that after all of the back and forth with my entree, the soup at no charge was the only consideration they made for my inconvenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=20,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002
50,Tara C.,"Tampa, FL",45,132,62.0,4.0,2016-08-21,"This is a 3.5...rounded up. First, this location is SMALL. The bar area is small and the dining area is small. Wait time was 1.5 hrs for a table. I can't imagine anyone would wait that long. However this is the Lehigh Valley and there isn't much else out there. I am a fan of BJ's. Having lived out west in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, I've been to a few BJ's. This location is the smallest of all. BJ's is a solid chain restaurant. Decent food, nice beer selection. One of the reasons I liked BJ's out west was because of the size of the bar area. You could always get a seat...not so here. This is opening week so you would expect things to not go as planned. My biggest concern is that I watched the west coast trainers BUSTING their butts, while the local team wasn't as engaged. That's concerning because the trainers will be gone in a few weeks...and the locals will be left on their own. Management team was engaged, trainers engaged, tons of employees...time will tell once it's left to the local crew. Check out BJ's...go early or be prepared to wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=40,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007
94,Michael L.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,8,,3.0,2016-08-21,"Unfortunately it was just underwhelmingly Ok.   For the price you pay, you expect a little better quality food.  Had the bison burger which was cooked well. May have been my fault that I did not specify but I was also not asked either.  A little too tough for my taste.  Secondly, it was served with cheap iceberg lettuce which makes it unappealing and un appetizing.   The poke appetizer. Stay away, should have known better ordering a Hawaiian  dish from a chain restaurant located in landlocked Pennsylvania. Lastly we ordered a deep dish hawaiin pizza. When did deep dish equate to thick bread with toppings on top?  It should be made like the outside of a pie crust with lots of filling inside.    Applaud their efforts at trying to diversify their food but unfortunately if you are looking for the new it place, this is not it. Will say wait staff tries really hard, probably bc they know food is nothing to be excited about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=80,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007
104,Stephanie N.,"Allentown, PA",11,15,,5.0,2016-08-25,"I am one of the pickiest people when I spend good money on a restaurant. My husband and I tend to favor local, but when my better half saw a burger and beer opportunity around the corner it was a must for him. We must have hit an opportune window as were seated in under 5 minutes. Our waiter, Kyle, was prompt to greet and made lots of descriptive suggestions. We ordered chips with guacamole and salsa. Chips were made in house. They had a good crunch, but I believe slightly chewy in spots from being thicker and fried. I ordered the Salmon Quinoa Bowl. It was perfectly cooked and the Quinoa was especially tasty. One hour start to finish. Will definitely be returning.

95,Bill S.,"Allentown, PA",3,49,4.0,4.0,2016-08-27,"Place was packed Friday night. Rather long wait for a table.  First time here at this new place. We went with friends and enjoyed it. Our server Hannah was really good. Helpful pleasant and kept her cool even though it was hectic.  I had the brisket burger and it was excellent. Their fries are thin, and I like them like that.  My wife had the thin crust pizza with jalapeños. She likes it spicy. It was good, but would prefer a crispier crust.  We had the calamari appetizer. It was ok, but we have had better. Great selection of beers and hard ciders. You can order flights and samples too.  We will go back.  Menu has a lot of choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=80,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
108,Michael B.,"New York, NY",0,8,,1.0,2016-08-28,"So I have been to the location several times since the opening. On my past visits everything has been great. Our server Hanna was fantastic. She was very helpful and was there for all of our needs. We started out with the calamari as an appetizer. It was ok a little bland but good. My wife tried the piadia and I ordered the rib eye ""medium rare"" as the main course. When the food arrived my wife's dish was great. I was asked to cut in to my stake to verify that it was cooked correctly and it was over cooked. At this point it's no problem I understand that the kitchen can be busy and to be honest things happen. So as most know to get a medium rare steak its 9 mins top on a hot grill. After waiting 15 mins and my wife almost finish with her meal I ask Hanna if she could please check on my meal. She comes back with the steak and when I cut in it once again it is over cooked. At this point my irritation it at MAX. I tell Hanna just to take it back and not to worry. This is where matters get WORST! The manager Jodi comes to the table to let me know that he is sorry that this happened and if I would like him to make it again. I stated that is not necessary I have lost my appetite. He proceeded to tell me that he doesn't want me to leave hungry that he can bring a menu and he will make sure that it comes out right. I told him that my wife has finished her meal and I just want to leave. He said please it will not take long to get the food out and it will be his treat. So I agreed to order something else. I ordered a sandwich due to it being fast and easy. Little did I know that not only did it take about 18 mins for it to come out and in a Togo box!!!! Now I have lost all patience. I tell Hanna just to take my card and charge me for the meal that all I want is to leave. Lets also add that they charged me for the sandwich. She goes to Jodi to let him know of the mishap and he seems not to care. Just rolled his eye and removed the sandwich from my bill and charged my card of the rest of the meal. When we go out we never expect to get anything for free even if there is a mishap with our orders but never have I had a careless manager handle my problem with my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

The wait staff are all extremely nice and courteous. The one waiter we had, Tom, is probably the best waiter I have had in any restaurant. The food is delicious! My sister loves the parmesan crusted chicken. I fell in love with the shrimp tacos. You have to try their fried portabella mushroom and stuffed mushroom appetizer. To die for! Other family members got the deep dish pizza which was yummy. Don't even get me started on how great the triple chocolate pizookie is. Their drinks are delicious as well, especially the strawberry splash and pink Cadillac.

No clearing of plates, drinks took forever as did getting the check. Food was typical chain and not what I expected from the things I had heard.

100,Rick O.,"Macungie, PA",0,2,,3.0,2016-09-22,"I've been to BJs twice for dinner now since it opened. I thought it was a nice place to grab a quick meal overall. I would've probably given it 2.5 stars if given the option.  Wait: I usually wouldn't put the wait time as a separate topic but my experiences here warranted it. The first time for two people walking in it took us about 45 minutes to be seated. Not bad, especially for being relatively new. Second time had a party of four. We used their app to check-in ahead of time. It told us to wait an hour, which was fine in the comfort of our own home. We got there and were told we would be seated next (my wife was nine months pregnant at the time). Unfortunately we had to wait for an additional hour and twenty minutes before being seated, with many parties who walked in being seated before we were.  There didn't seem to be a method to the madness. Why do the online check in to begin with? Maybe it was just ironing out some of the kinks. I think they underestimated demand. Definitely needs improvement regardless.  This was extremely frustrating and will make me hesitate before going back.  Service: Both times out servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed like they were spread thin but were never short with us or made us feel hurried. It did take them a good amount of time to refill drinks/waters. They were understaffed both times and it showed. The servers themselves were great though given the circumstances.  Ambiance: The restaurant is on the smaller side square footage-wise, but the high ceilings made it feel more open.  I was a fan of the decor. Exactly what I would want in a brewhouse environment. I realize it is new but everything was nice and clean! Noise level was about what I expected. A little on the loud side but didn't prevent you from carrying a conversation.  Food: I was pleasantly surprised with the food quality and their selection is very expansive. I had the chicken pita tacos with quinoa and thought it was great. I've also had the bison burger and thought it was good, not great. Generous portions. You can eat fairly nicely (steaks, salmon platter) or go simple (pizza/burgers).  It was tough for me to make a decision on what to order based on the menu size. Drinks:   I'm a beer drinker so I can't speak for their mixed drinks, though I was very satisfied with their beer selection. Lots of sections on draft. I sampled the beers they brewed, most of which were above average, and a few (including a seasonal collaboration beer with Green Flash Brewing) were great. They had a good mix of craft beers both local and west coast. I'm fairly certain they had your usual bar beers (lights and lagers) contrary to what another review said. The menu highlights their house-brewed beers and shows the other draft beers as a separate list. The craft beer selection is showcased on a big chalkboard at the back of the restaurant and seems to be updated regularly. You can get flights of any of the beers they have on draft, they do not limit them to only BJs beers. Though you can certainly find better/more expansive beer menus in the Lehigh Valley, theirs isn't one to scoff at.  Value: I thought the prices were very reasonable and if you look online (I think even on Yelp) you can find coupons for $$$ off or a free dessert.  For what they offer I would even say many of the prices were cheaper than expected. I definitely felt like I got more than I paid for. No complaints here! Bottom Line:   Good food at a fair price. Great beer selection. Be ready to wait for a table around dinner time regardless of calling ahead. Still need to improve the seating process. I probably won't go back until it gets a little less hectic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=100,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
91,Kelsi S.,"Breinigsville, PA",166,23,16.0,3.0,2016-09-25,"We've been to BJ's a few times now. The first time, I had a party of 8. We unfortunately did not make any reservations or call ahead, but figured since it was brand new, there wouldn't be much of a wait. We were very wrong on our part. However, they must have close to 0 tables for more than 6 people. We were told it would be about an hour. So we waited. Then it turned into an hour and half. We were told a table was just sitting around. It took nearly 2 hours and 10 minutes for us to be seated. When we were seated, the service was great, we had quite a few servers for our table and they were very efficient. A few of our orders got messed up, but besides that the food was pretty good. Went a few other times just for drinks at night and it's been hit or miss. Sometimes the service is good, other times you can have a  miserable server and it's very slow. I was there as recent as Friday in which a guest in our party did call ahead seating. However, when we arrived, she was told by the hostess that they had ""no idea"" what position we were in for the wait. We ended up getting seats at the bar but all in all, we probably would have waited roughly an hour for a table. Food is good. Drinks are good. Wait times on weekends anytime from 6PM-8PM are usually pretty lengthy. App does not work. Don't bother with call ahead seating, it doesn't do anything.

They were ok, came out a bit cold and could use more sauce - a bit dry. Went with my girl and we both ordered burgers. Very nicely done, served in an aluminum tray with thinly crispy fries. Nice touch! Fries are great but they weren't steaming hot which means you have to gobble them down quick!! To accompany the burgers we ordered some salad. Mozzarella and tomato salad was good. The menu is a bit way too big for my taste. Salads, pasta, pizza, fish, chicken, steak, veggie dishes. A bit overwhelming when you are hungry and really want to eat. It's like they combined the menu from Friday's, Apple Bees, Red Robbin and Joes Crabshack.  With so many options it's not possible to make everything perfect.

When your beer comes out with bubbles clinging to the glass or no head, your beer is not in a beer-clean glass. When it comes out completely flat, either gas is not getting to the barrel, the barrel is damaged, the wrong tap is being used for that type of beer, or they just washed the glass and it was still warm. These factors affect the taste of the beer and, yes, they WILL serve these to you.  There is obviously no training here, either for the bartenders pouring these beers or the servers bringing them to the table.  If it's not right, it should have never left the bar.

Ordered the calamari appetizer (actually both times, before I realized why the dish sounded familiar) - very greasy and oily and burnt, which is usually indicative of deep frying at too low of a temp but leaving it in the oil too long to make up for it. Main dishes were the deep dish pizza (taste was fine, nothing spectacular, but toppings were just a thin layer across the top, with a very doughy crust), a bread bowl clam chowder (bread to soup ratio was probably 2.5 to 1, taste wasn't terrible, just not memorable), a fried jalapeno topped burger (it's a burger, probably the best dish at our table), and the kale/brussel sprout salad (this dish made me cry, it was that bad, and I love both kale and brussel sprouts - there was no cohesion of flavor, just baby kale straight from the bag tossed with less than a handful of brussel sprouts, and I honestly couldn't tell you what flavor the dressing was - it was that bland). Wait time is long, since it's new and everyone wants to try the new place. Definitely not worth coming for the food. Hang out with friends at the bar? Sure, hard to mess up beer on tap.

Let me state for the record, my wife hasn't had as many bad experiences as I have.  Our first time there was about 3 weeks after opening. We sat ourselves in the bar area because there was over an hour wait...on a Sunday night at 830. My wife order a flatbread pizza and I ordered the beef dip. I ordered mine without the aoli sauce. We waited about 45 minutes for the food to arrive. My sandwich was cut in half. I ate the first half and it was pretty good. The second half was slathered with sauce. It's like they realized mid stroke that the sandwich wasn't supposed to have sauce on it and said ""oh well"". Cut it in half and sent it out. That's lazy. My wife's flatbread was burnt. I sent my sandwich back and got another one.  Second visit we sat at the bar again because of a long wait. I ordered wings as an appetizer and the ribs as a meal. We waited about 30 minutes for the food. The main meal came first and the server asked if there was anything else she could get me. I said ""yes. How about the appetizer?""  It was there a few seconds later. It was a bit annoying. Wings were good. Ribs were ok.  Last night we went a third time. Brussels sprouts for appetizer. They came out fairly quickly and they were good.  Then the food came out. Here's were it went wrong. When I ordered my food, I asked the server if he recommended the fish and chips or the sirloin. He said definitely the sirloin. He said he had it the other day and it was great. When it came it was small, thin and dry as a bone. But here's what really bothers me. Their menu claims ""house made sides"". I ordered the mashed potatoes. When I pay $18 for a meal, I expect real mashed. Not instant mashed. I guess adding powder to boiling water is technically house made. Really sad. My wife wanted me to return my meal. I don't want to be comped for my meal. I want a good meal.

She went above and beyond my expectations to make sure our large party had everything we needed. Never was anyone wanting for drinks or condiments. She was extremely knowledgable about the menu, and recommended the perfect beer for my meal. The food was super tasty. I've gotten the BJ's favorite pizza, which came out in this deep dish pan, making the crust so crispy (all about that crust). Toppings were loaded, and the sauce was plentiful. Definitely would recommend again. I also had the avocado egg rolls (mmm so much gauc yummm) and the crispy jalapeno burger, which was cooked perfect medium rare, and was simply delicious. The restaurant itself has a great modern atmosphere, bathrooms are tidy and clean, and the tables are comfy (important for me since I have back issues). The location of the restaurant itself is also pretty awesome since it's smack dab in the middle of the new Hamilton Crossings. I had a 45 min wait for dinner the one time, but we just went shopping nearby, so it was no big deal.

She didn't write that down either.  It seemed like forever for the burgers. My daughters burger had no cheese but we didn't want to wait for that too so she just ate it. The server was hanging out at the hostess station and talking with co-workers the entire time instead of bringing us our ketchup and water.

We left around 6:35. We only ordered 2 burgers and a chicken club & were there an hour and a half on a very slow night.

Service was great, and there were enough TV's that you could watch the Sunday night football game anywhere you looked.  The food however was underwhelming.  I ordered the brisket burger which I ordered to be medium. It was served well done. There was one part of my burger that was medium but the rest of it, overdone. One of the most average things I've ever eaten. One of the members of the dinner party got the pulled pork, which she said was ok but not the best she's had.  Another got one of their salads which received the same reaction as the pulled pork. The menu is the size of a textbook which is fine, but this place is having some serious identity problems with the extensive variety of food that they have. I think they would be better off with a smaller menu and figuring out how to hit those items out of the park, but thats just me.   Their house beer was solid. I had their IPA which I think was called the hopstorm IPA? and the pale ale was palatable as well. Overall, this place is average. I don't know if they're a chain but it definitely has that feel.

Food, expensive... Thier large pizza is 14"", and while the deep dish tasted pretty good, at $25 it wasn't a good deal.. Bone in wings... can you say small? Now say it again while imagining the wings even smaller.. and at $10.50 for 10 wings. Way to expensive, i can't think of anywhere else around here that doesn't sell bigger wings for less,  maybe if they were normal size.. naa thier sauce choice wasn't impressive either. Dessert was good though! Had the smores ice cream thingy, $6 something, had a free coupon. But i can see paying for that. Didn't try the beers, so ill let those reviews to others...

We also both had burgers; my wife's was prepared medium as she ordered it, but mine was cooked to well-done when I ordered medium-rare. It took quite awhile for our food to arrive even though they weren't at all busy (maybe because they were over-cooking my burger!) Our server, Crystal, was one of the best servers we've ever had anywhere - very attentive and personable.

47,Dee M.,"Allentown, PA",3,60,37.0,2.0,2017-04-08,"The hype around this restaurant coming to the area was profound. My family and I constantly talked about checking it out and just couldn't find the time, until now. What a disappointment!! First off, I really enjoyed the convenience of the app which allowed us to put our names on the waitlist ahead of arrival and the text message to alert us when our table was ready. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cool and crowded with a relaxed pub feel. Our waitress was very pleasant and good at promoting the menu. My son ordered a root beer, which we were told was made in house. He raved that it was delicious and couldn't get enough. That's where the compliments pretty much end. Right off the bat, the silverware and dishes were filthy. Filthy!! Our waitress apologized profusely and swapped them out for what she claimed came ""straight out the dishwasher"".  This should have been a warning. We ordered the root beer glazed ribs for the appetizer and the flavors kind of fell flat. There was no explosion in my mouth which totally contradicted the ribs' appearance. The cole slaw that came with it was better. The peach iced tea, which I was told was sweetened, of course wasn't. Then came the deep dish pizza, that we were told BJ's is famous for. Really it's the reason we were dying to try this place. Well what can I say? The pizza is in no way shape or form ""deep dish"". And it took us a minute to realize, but the pizza looked and tasted exactly like DiGiorno's frozen pizza. We paid $24 for what I could have bought in my grocer's frozen section for about 7 bucks. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good. It was just DiGiorno good. After this pizza debacle, our great waitress suggested a dessert that sounded too good to pass up. Her description of it's twice fried beignet covered in cinnamon and powdered sugar and topped with ice cream, fresh strawberries, strawberry sauce and whipped cream sounded simply divine. What we received was anything but. The beignet was so hard that cutting into it, much less chewing it, was a chore. It just tasted like a stale donut. No cinnamon. No powdered sugar. The tiny dollop of ice cream and strawberries couldn't save this disastrous end to a completely lackluster meal. I've come to the conclusion that maybe this place is strictly for the craft beers and drinks (which I did not try). Maybe I'll try this place again but just for a drink and an app if I'm too drunk to notice the lack of flavor. Maybe....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=40,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.7280000000000006,3.0000000000000004

15,Teresa H.,"Lansdale, PA",28,239,32.0,3.0,2017-07-16,"Bj's, a place where a pizza cookie is a piz-zoo-ky not a piz-ookie. At least that's how they say it. Last evening we chose to have an early dinner here to try it out. We had a coupon, which pulled us in despite the lowish reviews. We both ordered beer samplers (4 samples for almost $7). We also had avocado egg rolls, cauliflower tacos with Brussel sprouts, a quinoa shrimp bowl, and a salted caramel pizookie. For me, the avocado egg rolls were the highlight of the meal. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find dishes that are complex and delicious when dining out. These were perfect, 5 stars! I would return just to eat these. The beers were hit and miss. I enjoyed the hefeweizen and seasonal nit wit. The red was lacking and the blonde was bland. I tasted my partner's stout which was decent. I enjoyed that it was on nitro. The hopstorm lacked depth. Neither of us enjoyed that or the red. I'd rate the beer 3 stars. As for entrees, both left something to be desired. I felt that the cauliflower tacos sounded awesome, but they were lacking. The pita was strangely spongey. The cauliflower was bland and the entire dish underseasoned. I wasn't interested in the grain side, so I paid an upcharge for siracha Brussel sprouts. These were not very good either. My partner, who is less picky than me tasted my dish and said he thought it was pretty awful. I'd rate this dish a 2. He got the quinoa with shrimp. He said he was surprised he got as many shrimp as he did, but the flavor was just okay. 3 stars.  Lastly, we split a salted caramel piz-zoo-ky. This was the second best part of the meal. Warm and gooey. 4stars. The service was strange. The hostess was not very friendly and kind of just sent us the the bar area without actually asking us if we wanted to sit there. We waited a while for menus. Drinks came fast enough and our server was friendly. Our appetizer also came out pretty quickly. My partner's entree came out a while before mine and the guy who delivered it acted like he didn't know I ordered an entree. It was strange. Our bill was also brought before we had a chance to give our coupon or ordered dessert, also strange. One other annoyance is that we were dining around 420-430ish. My partner wanted a pork chop which stated after 4. He was told he couldn't have it because it wasn't late enough (despite being after 4). Before we even got dessert a pork chop was delivered to a patron behind us. Kind of annoying. Overall, service is 3 stars. The actual restaurant is nice and clean, but they missed an opportunity to offer outside seating and strangely sat a family with kids in the bar area. The menu could do a better job for vegetarians. Why do we need to pay the same price for a dish with meat as the vegetarian option?

40,James M.,"Langhorne, PA",55,2,,5.0,2017-07-26,"Last Monday, my wife and I found ourself out in Emmaus looking for a nice spot to grab a beer and some pub food. Despite there being a few cool spots nearby, we soon realized that most non chain restaurants in the area are closed on Mondays, so after searching around online, we decided on BJ's. Walking in, the first thing I noticed was how open it is inside, and how cool of an atmosphere they had. It's somewhere in between a sports bar, and a hipster gastropub. They have a few TVs with sports playing around the restaurant, but nothing too loud and distracting, and they have a giant chalkboard listing all the different beers they had on tap (including the ones they brew themselves), categorized by style. Very convenient and a cool idea. They have a huge menu. It's almost overwhelming but in a good way. Plenty of bar food, from deep dish pizzas that they're known for, to burgers, tacos, wraps etc. and a bunch of unique twists. They also have plenty of healthier or vegetarian options, and they list the calories beneath each item on their menu, which I appreciate. We both enjoyed our food, especially the Mediterranean Tacos, and finished by sharing a pizzookie, which was also amazing! The service was great too. I can't think of a single thing that I'd change. We'll definitely be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.0280000000000005,3.3200000000000003

Nothing has changed as far as their service.  My husband and I went in yesterday for dinner, the restaurant was not busy we got a table right away.  We both ordered a drink, and started with appetizers. Our Brussels sprouts came out, and wings... we each had a one wing, then my husbands salad came out one minute later, then low and behold our main entrees. That was upsetting, can't we just sit and eat our appetizers? Who eats that fast, why was everything was brought out on the table at once? Not to mention our food would get cold, and clearly there was no more room. We didn't even have the plates for our appetizers yet. I can't review the food because we complained to the manager and said we were leaving. One of the responses from the wait staff, was we will just put the food under the heater until you're ready. This happened to us both times, we went in to eat. The waitstaff wants to turn those tables quickly. There are lots of other pubs around where you can sit, eat and relax. Stay away from this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.6960000000000006,3.2000000000000006

It was fairly busy when we stopped on a Saturday during lunch. However, we just took a seat at the bar.  The menu.. is huge. Actually I find it to be a little extensive and all over the place with what they're trying to be. However, our food was good. I ordered tacos but they literally kept falling apart.  The beer... is awesome! I did a flight of their beers which was excellent. However, my husband ordered a beer that wound up kicking 3/4 of the way. If it weren't for the manager, I think the girl would have charged us. No joke.  The staff... I've had better. There were two bartenders on at the time. The girl was literally on her phone the entire time. She barely refilled drinks or checked on us. He guy never once came over for anything. I'm not sure if they work together or take turns having guests. We felt as if we were inconveniencing them, especially the girl. When she did wait on us she was nice but kind of felt forced. The manager was nice however and seemed very hands on. It's always good to see that in a restaurant.

Constantly coming over and trying to take our plates before we were even finished, did not ask if we wanted another drink, just asked if we wanted to-go boxes.   My wife got the Bacon Guac Delux burger and I had the Brisket burger, which we split so we can try both.  The Bacon guac was really good but the brisket burger had way to much of that super sweet BBQ sauce and over-powered the whole taste of the burger.  I am not sure if we will try them again, but if we do we will wait for a table instead of getting rushed out like we were eating fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-allentown?start=40,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

The wait time wasn't long and our server was Michacelia (not sure if I spelt her name right). She was so nice and helpful with everything. She was very attentive to our table, accommodated all of our needs and created conversation with us and just made the experience very very enjoyable. Exceptional service on her part!  Bjs had an extensive menu so there's a lot to chose from and the food was great. For appetizers I got the queso dip and others got the boneless wings. They were really good. For dinner I got an avocado burger which was very good while others at my table got the deep dish pizza (which was a decent size), soup, pasta, and more. Everyone was pretty happy with their dish. Only complaint was the jambalaya which was way too salty.  Bjs is known for their poozkie, which I ended up taking to go because I was so full but it was great! So overall I had a great experience at BJs but mainly because of our server Michacelia! She was so great.

They also have some great programs like free food for veterans on Veterans Day weekend. What encouraged me to write this review is the really special thing they did today. It's a super busy day and wait times are crazy. They are giving free pizza to people waiting in line. Seriously which restaurant feeds people for free before they actually eat at that restaurant. Just shows they are committed to great service.
