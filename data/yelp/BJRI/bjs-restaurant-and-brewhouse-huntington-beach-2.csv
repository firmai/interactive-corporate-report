Jaye S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",120,40,11,5.0,10/1/2017,Things were crazy on Main Street tonight but we just needed some food. We ordered the nice enough. We ordered and everything came out correct the best part was that the person who brought us our food had a smile on her face and was ready to help us with whatever we needed. We asked for 2 sides of ranch and she was back in seconds! So of course I had to ask her name thank you Victoria!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2
Dave Y.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/8/2018,"Terrible food, terrible customer service. Had a problem that could have been easily resolved but the manager Michael didn't want to do his job. I'll support the local pizzerias in HB instead of going here from now on. UPDATE: The General Manager Michele sent a quick response apologizing and offering to make it up to me with a phone number to call. She said she wanted to talk to me personally and I should call at my earliest convenience. I tried calling and quickly found out it was the restaurant number instead of her direct line. Had to listen to an automated system for five minutes and press zero to talk to a real person. Somebody at the restaurant finally answered and said she wasn't working today. What a waste of my time. I tried to give them a chance to make it up to me and they just proved my point. I stand by my 1 star review. I'd give them zero if I could. TERRIBLE customer service. This is how you lose business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2
Suzanne G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",25,74,16,2.0,11/9/2017,"The food was fine, the service was good (once someone came to take our order, after about 20 minutes), but the happy hour sign is deceptive. We were sitting in what appeared to be the bar, to the left of a wall separating the bar area from the restaurant area.  Based on the fact that we thought we were in the bar, we ordered from the happy hour selections.  When the bill arrived, there were no happy hour prices.  I asked and learned the hard way that the tables in the bar area that are not high tops aren't considered the bar. Lesson learned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2
Erica J.,"Fountain Valley, CA",7,15,,2.0,1/1/2018,"This is not the bj's i usually go to , but i tried this one today because all the breakfast/brunch spots nearby  were crowded. First thing, the tables were dirty after we waited about 5 mins for them to ""clean us a table"" . I had to ask them to clean it up but i just felt they should've checked the tables before seating people. There was orange juice spilled all over the floor in the table next to us. The spoon that they gave me for my soup was filthy with food from the previous customers. I asked for the a new one and the new one they gave me was just as bad. The food was just okay . I was actually disappointed in everything since we first sat down. Our waiter was really nice and attentive though . I forgot his name but it seemed like he was newer. I would probably never come back to this one though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2
Paige S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",144,141,69,1.0,1/25/2017,"Worst BJ experience. I've been here several times and had good experiences but last Saturday was horrible. I doubt I'd come here again. If I did it would just to get alcohol or water.  We waited for two hours on only our pizookie and house salad.  Our waiter was acting strange with all three of us, she kept on walking past us without even asking us if we're okay. We wanted to order or get something, we got nothing from her. She would come back every 15-30 minutes which is not okay. Maybe she just had a bad day who knows",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2
Peter F.,"Lomita, CA",186,126,74,5.0,10/18/2017,"Went here for lunch on a Saturday, with a friend after we came down to Huntington Beach to pick up our bibs for a local running race. As soon as we walked into the door we where greeted properly and asked where we would like to sit. We sat in a booth and settled in. Our sever Natasha came over immediately and asked if we wanted drinks. We asked for a couple waters and looked over the menu. My guest ordered a pizza and I the spaghetti and meatballs, with a side of asparagus. Well when the food came, it was acceptable and filling. Our server came and asked if everything was ok and refilled our water. After we finished we gave our server a thumbs up and both left with full bellies and smiles on our faces. I will definitely come back when I'm in town.  Two thumbs up",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2
Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3015,223,141,4.0,5/22/2017,"Stopped here for a few drinks today. The place wasn't too crowded and the hostess greeted us right away.  We opted to sit in the bar area(happy hour). Our server must have been a bit busy, the bartender had to come over and get our drink order. We waited maybe 5 more minutes then our waiter, Ryan, came to get our food order. We just wanted something small so we got the pizookie.  Overall this place is good to come to if you're in the area and want to stop by for happy hour or appetizers. The service is ok and the food is great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2
Steven D.,"Minnetonka, MN",12,218,69,4.0,5/24/2017,"This place is a solid local hangout. Nice and open, attentive service even with s shift change, people seemed to like the food.

Michael S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,121,69,4.0,12/11/2017,"Slow to start... but overall good experience. My wife and I arrived early for a group lunch. So, we went to sit in the bar. I grabbed a seat at a high top and she went to the restroom. My wife made it back to the bar, and I still hadn't been greeted by anyone yet. We waited a few more moments... still nothing. We decided to move to the bar top thinking that we can't possibly be ignored THERE because you're sitting directly in front of the bartender. Just our luck... as we sat at the bar... the bartender then proceeded right past us to head out to the high top tables and check on every single table.  I'd say we went a good 15 minutes without so much as a hello. We eventually got a drink order in, and everything seemed to normalize from there. Definitely a poor start though. Once we were sat, our group trickled in in bursts. So, I thank our server, Megan, for her patience. She was very helpful and attentive to our group.. even though we took a long time to get things going; much appreciated. She was also very gracious up front about splitting up checks accordingly. I don't believe there were any errors with orders, either. Great job. The kitchen did a great job of getting everyone's food out at one time. It's always a pain when you're in a large group, and yesterday's staff managed to make it happen. Awesome job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2

Wyn Dee S.,"Irvine, CA",1,32,,5.0,12/11/2017,"So we just had a very messed up experience with a grub hub order that I won't go into because what's more important is the manager Micheal turned a very mad family into a very happy family by fixing the problem, beyond call of duty.

Kristina R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/17/2017,"So, first let me start by saying that I love going to BJ's and have never eaten anything bad. Tonight was my birthday, and my family and friends took me here to celebrate. We called ahead to make a reservation and dealt with a very rude, and immature girl on the phone who we had to repeat ourselves several times to. When we arrived, we spoke to the hostess who was obviously the same girl who we spoke with previously. She started by acting extremely rude, like we were majorly inconveniencing her simply checking in. She told us that since it was a busy night, our wait would be at least 20/30 min. We asked if we could sit in the bar, and she said fine so proceeded there to find a large enough table for our party. We sat down and let her know she could take our names off her list because we found a table. She again sighed, and gave us a major attitude saying 'thanks'. She then proceeded to come to our table, and very rudely asked us if we checked in?? We looked at each other kind of dumb founded since we literally just checked in with her two minutes prior. She then started knocking stuff over on our table (and not making any effort to pick them up) and threw menus down, sighed and walked away. At this point we were ready to leave, but I asked for a manager instead and explained the situation. He was very kind, and apologetic. Then, as we were sitting there, the hostess who is standing no more than five feet away starts staring me down- literally staring at me with a smirk on her face. She did this repeatedly for a good five to ten minutes before I asked her if she had a problem. She then said 'nope, enjoy' and proceeded to again stare at me in an angry manner. I asked her what her problem was and that I'd like to speak to the manager again and she laughed and said very condescendingly that she couldn't hear me. I asked our waiter for the manager again, which he again apologized for her actions. We didn't see her for most of the rest of our visit Which was pleasant. When our desert arrived, she was back again and stood only a few feet away talking and laughing to another employee VERY loudly about how there were very awful customers who decided to complain about how rude she was, and how she had an attitude problem. She laughed and again continued to point and stare in our direction. I have NEVER experienced a more rude, or inconsiderate 'hostess' in my life! We live less than 5 minutes away, and I will go out of my way to never go back to this location again! I have no idea how someone of this magnitude would even get a job here! Extremely disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2

Kyle and Tory went above and beyond they're call of duty! The customer service was impeccable! I haven't even mentioned the food!

Absolutely horrible service, empty restaurant too, what are they doing??? Managers name is Tory. Came in 1-3-17 around 11:18pm. Slow Stoner service. Also I asked for the managers name from the blonde girl at pickup, she said Aracely, which was probably a lie? Anyways she should be accountable if she lied about the managers name, who knows what else she will lie about. On top of that they also forgot my soda.

Angela A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/18/2017,"Soooo- im a lyft/uber driver. I end up in Huntington often enough. I like the happy hour that bjs has... Overall I'm giving two stars because I came in during happy hour at 4:22 pm on a Monday. Not busy at ALL.:.. sat in bar tables area... took 12 minutes for anyone to come up to me. I did sample few beers... another 12 minutes and no one... Decided to sit directly at bar because someone was at bar and figured I'd get attention that way. Steve was behind bar and was 1000 times more on it as far as making sure I had what I needed. Asked what I would like, remembered he had served me a week or so ago, what I got and had suggestions for something different to drink which I took and liked...if you're gonna be here see if he's here. He makes sure you have what you need... My two stars are for lack of service during a non busy time of day.  If I had continued to just sit- who knows when someone would come up.  Other servers that were doing tables right near me-nothing....walked by me several times. No comments of someone will be with you. Nada.

David R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,3,7,1.0,12/27/2017,This BJ's in particular had so much disorder and although the workers were extremely kind they couldn't agree on one server for our table and we had confusion with our pazookis. The food portions were tiny and the food itself was not good. I love  the BJ's in Downey but this one has a tiny menu and our pizza was undercooked and had paper on it!

Jenna H.,"Santa Ana, CA",15,21,9,2.0,6/27/2017,"Went here with a group for a friends birthday, we were waited by Jared who started off quite pleasant. As the night went on he paid less and less attention to us. I asked multiple times for water and condiments. We even watching him pass us by with the water pitcher in his hand while catering to other customers.  That wasn't the worst part.. At the end of the night it got worse when we paid our bill. Our bill came out to $54 and I paid with a $100 bill. I was leaving the tip and noticed I was short $20 dollars on my change. I question Jared about the short change and he questioned if I was being honest. Then said he believed me and remembered putting only one $20 bill. He then awkwardly pulled out a wad of cash from his BACK POCKET and handed me the second $20. I was completely thrown off by the whole situation, not sure why the money would be coming out of his back pocket and not the register. Just his reaction and the awkwardness made the whole situation seem shady.

Jake S.,"Newport Beach, CA",40,4,,2.0,11/13/2017,"I've always been going to BJ's of Orange as my primary ""night out"" restaurant or craving place of choice. But as this one was closer to me I decided to give this location a try thinking it would be similar.  Honestly I was very disappointed with the service, our server took quite a long time while it was not particularly busy, and the food took a lot longer than normal. When the food did arrive it was put together very lazily (The Hickory Brisket Burger), and somehow had lost its flavor which I regularly crave.

Dania A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,80,35,3.0,9/16/2017,"I'm a fan of this chain and I do love how late they're open but service was pretty slow (on a quiet Thursday afternoon) and while it was friendly, it seemed like there was one server entirely that she looked overwhelmed and disoriented. The food was good, minus the kale superfood salad. Something about it was off; either the dressing or the combination of items, but it didn't bode well with the table. The chicken tortilla soup and baked potato soup were delicious; and the buffalo chicken pizza was perfect. Not a slice remained. We definitely saved room for a pizookie and got the salted caramel one. Nothing left there either. The only complaint was, although we know sitting outside comes with bugs flying around, there was an unbelievably ridiculous amount of flies everywhere. It was like something spilled earlier or I don't know what, and they were congregating and it really made the atmosphere uncomfortable.

The manager called paramedics and got them to me fast. In the meantime, Tori (waitress maybe? not too sure) sat on the floor of the bathroom with me and tried to keep me calm. She deserves a raise for being so helpful and willing to sit on a bathroom floor for a stranger. This is not my first time visiting this BJs and it won't be my last. Especially because of the excellent service and help I received in a scary situation I had never found myself in before.

I love a juicy steak but this one was on the dry side and the rice pilaf was very plain. The clam chowder was the only thing that was satisfying. My boyfriend ordered one of the pizzas and the bread was a bit chewy in my opinion. There are plenty of choices to eat at on Main Street but I knew I liked this restaurant so opted to eat there.

Samantha M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",262,3,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Came in on a Wednesday night... walked into the restaurant, no one was standing at the greet stand. We waited for about 5 minutes before someone finally walked up to greet us, I think it was someone who worked the to go area because the actual host came to take over eventually. We asked if we could have a table outside since we had noticed some were open but were waiting to be bussed. We were told that table would be offered to he next person on the waitlist. No big deal, could we be added the the waitlist? It was just a bizarre experience with the host because they weren't friendly at all and I felt like I was having to direct the flow of the experience. Normally wouldn't a host offer this to you? I felt like it was more of a ""what do you want"" situation? Anyways.. we were told we could have the next table that got up outside. So we waited outside, watched the table get up and leave and then stood there and watched nobody buss it for 10 minutes.. finally I went and found someone to buss it. They cleared as much as they could but it still needed another trip and a wipe.. and the host was no where to be found again.. finally I look at my husband and we are unsure about whether or not to just seat ourselves? Finally the host comes up to the table and leaves us the with menus. We know what we want and are hungry and ready to order. Our server greets us and was nice and prompt, but the food took soooo long. Our pizza arrives and is not hot but we are so hungry and don't want to wait for a new one. We know we want a pazookie so we put in the order for that which also took around 20 Minutes. No one cleared our dirty plates or silverware from dinner so we are eating our dessert around dirty dishes. We just want to pay and leave. Overall a dining experience that should have only taken an hour to an hour and a half tops took over 3 hours because the host and bussers were MIA and the food took a ridiculously long time.

Sadaf Q.,"Huntington Beach, CA",33,119,137,4.0,6/27/2015,"TLDR: Their pizzas and pizookies are what you should try!!  More like a 3.7/5 but rounding up!  Their pizzas are undeniably very yummy! They have many choices and it's a great way for multiple people to order and eat and bond. What separates BJs from somewhere like California Pizza Kitchen is that they have more options on other dishes to choose from. Kind of like a less variety version of Cheesecake Factory and with more pizza.  My favorite of their pizzas is barbecue chicken pizza! They don't overwhelming put BBQ sauce and they have tomatoes on top too. I also like their vegetarian one as well. You can choose to make pizzas without chicken or meat; they aren't sticklers about sticking to exactly the way the menu is written out.  For their other dishes, I've tried the Caesar salad. What I love about the Caesar salad here is that they actually give you a decent amount. You can also add protein on it, which I added salmon! The salmon was really, really well flavored and cooked! I would get this again if I wanted a lighter meal.  But if you're coming with a large group, it's best to go with pizzas and some appetizers!  And for dessert, always go with the 3 option pizookies!!!  You get to try more flavors and it allows you to share as well. One pizookie is too much for me, personally, because it can get really sweet with the ice cream and cookie itself.  Their service is pretty good. Their pricing is also reasonable as well. This place is also pretty good for bigger groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=80

Cedric D.,"Anaheim, CA",5,10,1,1.0,4/18/2017,"A group of friends and I came to Bj's to have an early birthday dinner for me, hoping for some great laughs and great food, but that was the complete opposite. We checked in our party of 11 at 9:00 pm on April 18, 2017 with an estimate wait time of 30-45 minutes. As 45 minutes creeps up our anxious group wanted to know why it was taking so long, so we decided to ask one of the host, how much longer will it take to get seated? She replies that they already have a spot reserved for us but that they're waiting for a party to leave to complete our seats. We understood and proceeded to wait. Another 30 minutes passes by and now we're getting more anxious because they still haven't called us after more than an hour of waiting. We were told by one of the waitresses that the party blocking us from getting our seats has already gotten their check. Another waitress told us she would talk to the party to see if they're ready to wrap it up, she walks towards them but never acknowledges them and proceeds to come back to us and lie in our face saying again ""they have their check."" I had politely walked up to this group of three asking if they were done since we've been waiting for so long, they had told me they're service is horrible and they even had to call another waiter to take their orders. Oh the the funny part is they didn't even have their check and were barely ordering dessert! That made me and the other members of our group outrages. The manager ""Michael Avila"" started sympathizing with us telling us he's ""trying to accomadate us"" when even he told us before that said party had their check. When I confronted him asking why are you telling us they have their check when they haven't even ordered dessert?

Marcus M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",138,7,,2.0,5/21/2017,"Giving this a 2 Star review only because of previous good experiences (we eat there a few times a month) but unfortunately the bad experiences make the greatest impressions. Normally I eat here during the week and never come to Main St on the weekends (we live a few blocks away) but decided to give it a shot as a last minute Sunday dinner.  We got here and the wait wasn't bad just about 5min total. We were sat down and about 5-10min later we were greeted by our waitress. Since we have eaten here on numerous occasions we already knew what we wanted to order. We ordered our drinks, appetizers and dinners. Shortly after ordering we received our drinks. Then I recieved the soup that came with my dinner (Prime Rib). The only problem was that I asked for it to come after the appetizers. No big deal I will just put it to the side and eat it later. Then our appetizers come and we proceed to eat them. A little while after the appetizers I am am informed that my Prime Rib is not offered in Rare/Medium Rare at the moment and I can either have it Medium, Medium Well or Well Done. I decide to get it Medium only because I didn't want to wait for a different meal to be made. The meals come a few min later and my Prime Rib is more on the Well side than Medium. Whatever it's not the end of my life. The food is good and it's getting late, my kids need to get home and go to sleep since they have school in the morning.  We finish our food and I ask the waitress for a few to go boxes, our check, parking validated and the Pazooki that was included with my meal. She realizes that she put my order in wrong but said that she will have her manager fix it. She comes back with our boxes and check. She informs me that the Pazooki is being made as we speak. Our bill is $68 so I decide to leave her a $20 tip because I know that servers rely on tips to make any real money. We box up our food and wait for our Pazooki. And wait. And wait. And wait. After 30min of trying to get our servers attention I finally corner her at the front register and ask her about the Pazooki. She said that she will check on it. She comes back and says that her manage is putting a rush on the Pazooki upon which I tell her that it's already been over 30min since we ordered it. Nobody at our table has anything left to drink and we haven't gotten any water refills since starting dinner. I tell her to just cancel the desert. I decide to change her tip from $20 to $10 which is still probably more than most would tip under this situation. I am unsure if or when we will come back. If we did it will definitely never be on a weekend and even at that it's probably going to be a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=40

Christina M.,"Barelas, Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,2.0,6/14/2017,"The staff at this location is.... weird. They seemed rude and disorganized. I understand they were busy when I went in but based on the size of their staff, you'd think they could manage it. I felt uncomfortable before I was even seated. I walked up to the hostess and a guy I believe was a busser. The interaction was just weird. These two particular staff members made sarcastic comments about something that the people I was with were wearing them they turned and laughed at each other. I'm pretty sure they were fucking with us.  The hostess led us to a dirty table, after she told us that someone had already gone to clean it. I understand things happen but it was just disorganized and the staff seemed to lack communication. At one point, someone at the table next to me spilled a drink on them and the bussers didn't seem to know what to do. The spill stayed on the floor for a while after that until what looked like a manager told a busser to clean it. The guy seemed really confused like he didn't know what he was doing for a moment then finally took care of it. When our food came out, the guy giving us our food made more weird sarcastic comments. I understand trying to make small talk but there are more things to talk about than something you observe about your guests. He even mocked my voice, which kind of high pitched. I guess he was trying to be funny or whatever but I was on edge because of the comments from the hostess earlier.  I observed the other staff members. I noticed that the servers around me at other tables were very nice, courteous and polite. Out waitress, Danielle R. was great. If not for her being just a normal waitress, I'd have thought that the staff's goal for the night was to see how many customers they could piss off. I guess it just seems that the bussers, hosts and runners are bored or something and trying to entertain themselves at the expense of their guests. It was just weird and uncomfortable. I think that staff really needs to consider how they look to their customers and how they treat them.  2.5 stars. Food was good and our waitress was nice but everything else just made me uncomfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=40
John L.,"Emeryville, CA",74,227,10,2.0,7/6/2017,"Sometimes a busy night means long waits for tables.  I get that. But when a 20-25 minute wait turns into nearly an hour, and I have to bus my own table just so the nearly an hour wait doesn't turn into over an hour, I tend to get a little cross with the service.  Still, it's to be expected at a place like this.  However there's a line where expectations end and incompetence comes into play.  BJ's crosses it. Pros:  +convenient location to Huntington Beach pier. +Plenty of big screens inside to catch the game +Good portion size and price +Wide selection of entrees Cons -crowded -loud even for a bar/pub -slow, inconsistent service -parking can be difficult A party of six can be somewhat challenging but it felt like this location had maybe 4 tables that could  fit six, less if you don't want to be crammed into a corner. We ordered an appetizer (calamari) and it arrived with no plates to eat it on. I asked for plates for our party of six (the server never brought them out) and got four.  Our drink order was wrong, and when they did remember to bring the final plates, one of them had baked on cheese from an insufficient cleaning. Waiting for a drink refill was at least 10 minutes from the tune we had to flag our server down to ask for a refill.  For the duration of our meal, we saw our server at the following times: ordering drinks, ordering entrees, getting refills (the first time had to be solicited, and there was only one other time), and checking in on how we were doing.  Once.  And of course, checking if we were ready for the bill, completely forgetting to see if we wanted dessert, much less actually bringing the dessert that came with our meal. And throughout, not a single plate or glass was cleared off our table.  I'm not impressed.  They weren't rude and were apologetic, but in the end, intentions only cover so much and service as a whole drags them down.   The food is acceptable.  Flavors were solid and robust if a little salty, and the prices are typical, certainly not a tourist trap kind of pricing scheme.  There are a number of specials and while things are a little haphazard in terms of selection, everyone will be able to find something that hits the spot for them.  Everything entree wise was prepared correctly, but we're also talking about the bare minimum.   The only reason this review isn't a one star is that none of these errors were indicative of poor overall quality, just youth, inexperience and a busy night.   Service issues aside BJ's is a typical damily/bar restaurant with all the potential pitfalls being realized in a beach side chain restaurant.  As I've said before, when part of a franchise or chain, service is the main way to distinguish yourself, and this place fails that metric.  It's the nature of the beast, so take it into consideration when looking for a place to eat.  Especially when the beast is poorly trained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=40

First she spilled some chips on me, and when I asked for extra napkins she never returned. I also wanted to let her know it was my bf's birthday when he went to the restroom so it would be a surprise, and she paid no attention to me! I looked to see if she was busy and she walked to the bar where a few coworkers were hanging out and just started talking socially. When I finally got her attention I was greeted with so much attitude I couldn't believe it. She slapped my menu closed in my face and walked away as if she were in a hurry while I was still talking to her in mid sentence! I mentioned the bday & she bent down in my face and said something like ""ok, I'll get your FREE pizooki for his 'birthday'"" sarcasm slap to the face! Why would I lie about his bday she is so rude!

Leland S.,"Irvine, CA",876,755,1008,4.0,4/10/2015,"I don't usually do corporate but when I do it's when I receive gift cards, free pizookie coupons, and happy hour. Here's how my experience went: Ambiance Parking | Plenty of parking whether it's street or garage. We came here on a Tuesday evening for Surf City nights at around 6pm. We didn't have any problems at the garage 2 streets over 2 dollars for 2 hours? I'm down with that. Seating | Plenty of seating outside and inside however it does get pretty packed. The tall seats are on a first come first serve basis though. Feels | In the heart of Huntington Beach Main Street. Coming here during Surf City nights is an additional plus. Feel free to watch a game or even people watch. It's a nice place for almost any type of night. Food: Spinach & Artichoke Dip (A-OK) * Borderline good and okay. Good because it was served fresh and has a nice kick to it. However I wished they balanced the ratio so there's enough dip for the chips. Great White Pizza (Recommend) * Deep dish and delicious, you can't go wrong with alfredo sauce! Ask for some tabasco too. Mediterranean Pizza (A-OK) * Though it is mediteraneany. I personal don't like the olives... =/ Avocado Egg Rolls (A-OK) * I used to enjoy these however I feel like it got more unhealthier. The crunch is there along with the rich avocado however ours was pretty oily and that just made us full before the pizzas came. Customer Service: They were pretty quick with or order nothing too special but good respectable service. Overall: 4 stars. I like the options on the happy hour menu. Price is about right, the wait was reasonable and the food was delicious. Not a bad way to enjoy Huntington Beach especially during happy hour. TL;DR Tips: *RSVP for nicer seats! *Happy Hour | M-F:3-7pm & S-Th:10-Close * Kitchen closes an hour before close",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=40

Everyone devoured their meals. Tyson's  ribs were fall off the bone.  My mahi was perfection with a great pineapple fried rice...and Jenni's salmon and couscous was really flavorful.

Squeeze some fresh lime and you're set. I don't really like the personal size pizzas because you don't get as much surface area of cheese and toppings. You're better off sharing a larger pizza. I DO NOT like the service here. I have never had good service because they just aren't attentive. During lunch they take 10-15 minutes to get to your table.

Walking in we would expect someone to be curious and ask for a name and for us to be seated or just possibly wait. Which I am totally fine with as its Downtown HB. But first of all the staff was ignorant and ignored myself and my girlfriend that was with me. This made us feel not valued at all as a customer even though It was around 2:45 and wasn't even that busy. But after this was said they put us in the back of the restaurant next to the smelly bathroom which both waiters and waitresses were walking in and out of without washing their hands!

Nope we ordered a plate of buffalo wings which were not only freezing cold but old like they had been sitting there for a long period of time. I only confronted them after bout 20 minutes of waiting for them To finally stop Talking to each other and reach our table in the back to realize my waiter went on break and didn't tell us or let us know we didn't have another waiter. After this happened we waited another hour and was around 4:15-4:25 when we finally received replacement for wings we ordered. Which by the way they tried to charge us for when they Couldn't even do the first order right? Gimme a break. After an hour and half later around 4:35 the food finally arrived and you could tell was rushed and undercooked on the chicken which my Girlfriend got and the pizza I ordered was way chewy and almost fought in my mouth cause of the dough.

But unfortunately, even during the less crowded times, the service is still terrible. On my most recent visit (and definitely last), we got there at about 10:00 p.m. We were seated immediately as it wasn't crowded at all, but it took the waitress 15 minutes to greet us and get our drinks. It was then another 15 minutes before she returned to take our food order. While everyone in my party (4 of us) were not happy with the service, we relaxed a little since our food order was put in. It ended up taking about 35 minutes for the food to come out. We were honestly just about to get up and leave but we saw a girl bringing the food. The food was pretty good. I personally ordered a burger, and must say it was definitely well prepared. While I wasn't happy waiting over a half hour for it, I am glad it still came out to my liking.

I usually go to the one closer to me, but I was down in HB so I decided to come here with some friends.  First, we came here during the middle of the week. (It was a Wednesday evening, so it wasn't busy). They ran out of lemonade after my first drink, which is fine, but it took 20 minutes waiting for our drinks. We waited an HOUR for our food to get out and when we would ask our waiter where it was at, he would get annoyed and tell us that it would be out in a couple of minutes.

Needless to say, this was a severely annoying dinner. The food was great, but the service was god awful. If the place was packed and really busy, I would understand completely.

The hostess rushed by and rudely said I'll be with you in a few minutes I have other tables inside. Ok cool. Sit down and wait about 20 minutes to order. We order an appetizer it comes out way late. It was a quest dip and the top layer was cold so the cheese hardened. The chips were cold. So we sent it back. It came back 10 minutes later warm. Not hot  but somewhat warm. Pizza comes it's okay.

We didn't want to sit at the bar, so we asked her one more time if it was ok to sit outside. So finally we sit down and she walks over to us and gives us the menu. We start looking for some drinks. She comes back and asks us what we wanted, we let her know what we wanted and she rudely corrects my fiancé. And thought we could laugh about it, but no. She was very rude and she didn't even crack a smile.  So she brings us our drinks and as soon as we get them my fiancé notices a hair on the lime of my drink (gross!). The waiter, that had brought us our appetizers, was very nice and kind to take the lemon and replace it. We didn't really want to be there any longer because she was very rude to us the moment we had stepped in. The waiters that brought our food out were very nice. Overall I would still go to bj's, just not this one. She ruined our whole experience there with her rudeness. Maybe she wasn't having a good day or she was tired, which we could understand. We tried to make her smile and nothing.  I love bj's but I don't think I would be returning to this one because of her, I didn't get her name but she had orange hair with pale skin and freckles.

We started with a beer and their signature Bloody Mary. I wans't to impressed with this. Maybe it was the Absolute Peppar or maybe it was the Bloody Mary mix. IDK. But I wasn't a fan.  For starters we ordered the Ahi Poke and the Mini Bruschetta. And for our lunch we ordered the breakfast sandwich and the Fish tacos. Our starters came out before our main course and then about thirty seconds after the appetizers came out, our lunch came out. Bad timing on the kitchen's end but it happens.  Anyway, the Ahi Poke needed... flavor. I DUMPED salt on it. It helped, but obviously it's BJ's so how good could the Ahi Poke REALLY be?! I also didn't care for the mini bruschetta either - the little bread it came on was too thick so it was hard to bite and then the toppings fell off.  I guess the breakfast sandwich was fine - it's kind of difficult to mess THAT up... and my fish tacos were just aiight. Not too much flavor.. However I did REALLY like the salsa that came with and the avocado cream sauce! Nom nom! That was THE best part for me.

Kat H.,"San Diego, CA",54,266,785,2.0,3/26/2015,"Usually have a great time at BJs locations, but this location was a little disappointing. We were a party of 7 looking for a small meal before a big BBQ feast later at night so two of us shared the deep dish lasagna, I got a root beer for myself, and the rest of the table shared a medium deep dish pizza.  After we ordered, our server left all the menus at the table all cluttered until about 15 minutes later when I asked for a second or third refill on my root beer. For my root beer refills, server seemed a little annoyed (head down, didn't say a word when he took the mug to refill nor when he brought it back) which made me feel a little awkward thinking I had done something wrong for asking for refills.  Also, I am aware the deep dish lasagna and deep dish pizza both take longer to bake because of their...deepness, but the wait was ridiculous. It was at least 30 or 40 minutes later before we got our two food items. The restaurant wasn't crowded either. If it is supposed to take that long, a reminder from the server when we ordered these items would have been fine, but we didn't get one. No ""sorry for the wait"" afterwards either. Food finally came and I have always loved the deep dish lasagna at BJs so that came out perfect as always. Deep dish pizza also got good feedback and the group wished they had ordered a larger one. Deep dish at BJs isn't really deep dish though, probably half the height of a regular deep dish pizza with an overly large crust but our buddies didn't complain so oh well. The five who shared the deep dish pizza felt a little awkward at the end when they paid enough cash to cover the bill and a 20%+ tip, but weren't given the change back.   For the experience we got, we would definitely not have tipped that much. I rarely mention bad service unless it's really bad and this was one those really bad times.

The chicken Alfredo actually had a decent portion of meat even though still around 35 to 65% meat to carb ratio, the pizza on the other hand was extremely unbalanced considering bj's famous thick dough pizzas, just eyeballing i would say something around 5 to 10% max both by volume and mass and even low on veggies and other ingredients, felt a bit like eating a giant piece of bread with a thin spread of everything else, but i guess the bogo coupon does make it an acceptable occasional option.

Mike S.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",16,21,5,1.0,8/24/2014,"To say the least last night was a disappointment. After eating elsewhere on Main Street, my girlfriend and I decided to head to BJs for a pizookie. I went on my phone and ordered dine ahead hoping to make it a painless dessert. I reserved a time of 10pm and was told it would be 15 mins. We were sat at 10:30 and did not see our waitress for another 15 minutes. By then our pizookie had arrived and she stopped and apologized. We asked for our bill and that was promptly delivered. Although picking it up was another 10 minute wait. We got up and found our waitress to give her the bill.  The most disappointing part of last night was me accidentally leaving my phone on the table. It took but two block to realize I had forgotten it. We called back and were on hold for 10 mins before I decided to walk back and retrieve my phone. The hostess said they were getting a manager to unlock the office. After 10 mins he comes up empty handed and grabs my info seeming very insincere. I assured him I knew I had left it at the table and that I was going to locate my iPhone with my girlfriends phone. I asked what would happen when I found my iPhone located there. He said I would not find it because no one had it. I step outside and begin locating my phone and before I could even locate my phone I received a call from the waitress stating she had found my phone.  I walk right back into BJs and she has my phone I'm hand. I ask her where she found it as the manager walks up and she is stumbling over her words to give an answer or a name. I was livid. I then asked the manager what the policy was on lost items for the restaurant as I could only assume it would be to turn them in or place them in a certain location for patrons.  Having worked at restaurants, I know this type of thing happens a lot. I also know things like a phone just do not go ""missing"" one moment and there the next. Sad to know that there is such a lack of honesty and integrity at an establishment such as this one.

Flipping out in the bar area where MY family 7 and 8 year old were at eating their breakfast. Lots of F bombs going on. Took everything I had to not go punch her in the throat =)  WITH THAT SAID, I don't know who the Hostess was as far as her name goes, but she was great. She came and got our empty plates came and gave my family refills while our waitress was MIA. Super sweet girl. I ordered 2 bloody marys while I was there, because that is how I get my vegetable in take. They were WAY different. The first one was the bomb the second one tasted like a V8 with a bunch of olives in it. GROSS. I also asked for a Diet Coke for my daughter who has Type 1 diabetes and they gave her a Dr. pepper or Mr. pib. Thanks Assh0les, I specifically asked the waitress anything Diet please because my daughter has Type 1. It wasn't like we had a huge order of drinks to get mixed up and it wasn't even busy yet. The girl who was the awesome bartender came up to another employee and was telling her and showing her how a brand new bottle broke over the ice and had to melt the ice because of the glass that was broken into it. Yes thank you for announcing that as I am sitting here drinking my V8 Bloody mary. Best service ever! The last 2 BJ's that I have been to have been in the OC. NO THANK YOU. I will stick to the San Diego BJ's and anywhere else that is not related to the OC. I gave 2 stars because of the Hostess.

I ordered a new cocktail that wasn't very good and she made it seem like a hassle that I didn't like it. So I asked for another drink instead. At the end of the meal I was charged for both cocktails and she sighed at the table when I asked her to take off the bad cocktail. As a server, the money spent on making the bad cocktail wasn't coming out of her pocket, so there should be no reason for giving attitude to a customer.

The salmon was served without the rice or sauce (contains wheat). The dish was fresh, but very blend, if not boring. The Balsamic chicken had a great taste, the combination with cranberries was very nice. The chicken itself was slightly dry.  The restrooms were not clean at all.  The place was alive :-) not to say crowded and loud. Liked the atmosphere still. Our service was pretty ok.

Tiffany L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",178,68,16,2.0,6/21/2014,"I've never had a terrible experience at ANY BJ's restaurant until I came here.  A couple friends and I were seated after waiting 20 or so minutes on a Friday night. Our server brought our drink after being seated for a couple minutes. We ordered three appetizers: potato skins, traditional wings, and spinach and artichoke dip. Being super hungry, we were excitedly waiting for our appetizers!  We waited between 30-40 MINUTES just the appetizers alone. We watched in agony as tables around us received their appetizers AND meals. Our server barely acknowledged us for the first 20 minutes. Then after, she came to our table and asked us if we got our appetizers when it was very obvious that we didn't since the appetizer plates was stacked exactly how she left it. Isn't it her responsibility to know? But no! She told us she didn't know what happened, and then left to care for other customers. If you don't know what happened, figure it out and put in another order. A simple explanation could be nice. It's reasonable if maybe another server took our food by mistake; my table won't be mad but just let us know instead of ""I don't know what happened"". But thanks for reassuring me that you don't know what you are doing.  The manager eventually came to our table and told us he didn't know what happened either. Sigh....  but thank goodness he brought it out after 5 more minutes. He also made it on the house to make up for the long wait.  We were about 75 percent done with the appetizers when they brought out pizookies. We ordered them in advance and told them to bring it out after our meal. We had to stop the appetizers, no way I was letting the ice cream melt! After I finished the pizookie, I finished my appetizers. This is probably the weirdest dinner sequence I've ever experienced. The whole timing of the night was very off. We received our appetizers late, but our pizookies early.

The salad had horrible dressing, and my friend's salmon was very plain. In total, we were there for an hour. Most of that hour was spent waiting for our food.

I got the barbecue chicken and the chicken bacon ranch pizza.

I was truly impressed by the swift reply to my initial feedback. Despite this, a person named Jesse reached out to me after I was disappointed with a recent experience. He wanted to make things right by offering me a courtesy card. In order to do so I provided him with personal information -- my home address on 6/17/2014. It has been more than a month and have not received anything, which is upsetting because now BJ's has personal information of mine in which I trusted to disclose to them; which is my mistake because I wasn't aware of what they were going to do with that information (apparently not send me a courtesy card). So my advice is if BJ's asks for personal information don't, because it seems they have no process in place that ensures that they will deliver on what they promise (when it comes to customer feedback)  and it's unclear as to whether or not that information is secure or used for other purposes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=180

One level. Nice bar area. The rest of the seating is limited.  We sat down ready to order. After the order was placed I was browsing through my BJ'S app and found a free appetizer or mini pizookie .  I should have known. I asked the server let's call him ""Austin."" About ordering a appetizer. His reply was he would have to check with the Mgr. about using the coupon, because we ordered a ""special of the day"" after 10 minutes he comes back to offer a refill on my water. I asked if I could order the appetizer. He was waiting for a Mgr. to get approval. 10 more minutes I grab him and he says good news  it was approved. I need to watch you redeem your coupon. What?!  Actually Yelp has the same coupon when you check in. I'm going to use that one. He said I had to use the one on the BJ's app. Finally after a few minutes of going back and forth, he said that's fine AND walked away! No order taken. So we continue to wait.

Immediately after our orders were taken the server never came back once but preceded to walk past our table twice while my empty glass just sat there and never did he once ask if i wanted a refill. Our food was brought out by another server who I had to ask him for a refill which he said he would tell my waiter. I guess he decided he had no choice but to come back and give us our drinks, to which he proceeded to ask us how the food was. After then he went back to avoiding our table and helping all his other tables but ours. It's kinda of sad we actually had to ask the hostess for to go boxes and to put in our order for free pizooki day. To once again he wasn't the one who brought our dessert to the table. He happily came back with our checks 5 mins later to which he charged us for one of the pizookis when clearly we shouldn't of been charged for one. When my friend tried to explain it to him he simply said its one per table your server should of told you that. Funny thing he was our server and this problem could of been avoided if he actually did his job. He proceeded to talk to his manager and come back to us with an attitude saying the manager said they'll take it off but this is the last time. I like how all of sudden the problem clearly got turned around on us when he wasn't the one doing his job in the first place.

Any time I was asked if I needed anything, it was another server who relayed the message to my actual server. The icing on the cake was the 20 minute wait for the check, and the extra 10 it took for our ACTUAL waitress to ring it up. Needless to say I'm pretty disappointed.

We were treated as a joke just because we looked young. They probably thought we were going to dine and dash. Keep in mind we arrived at 5 pm. We ordered an appetizer, a pizza, and the trio pizookie. The appetizer took 20 minutes to come out. After we finished that, the pizza was still not out yet. We basically stared at each other across the table for 40 minutes. I caught myself asking ""where's the pizza?!"" at least 5 times. Our waitress passed our table so many times. Not once did she check up on us, yet she checked other tables to see how they were doing. We also asked for parmesan cheese but by the time our waitress brought it out, we finished the pizza. Last was the pizookie. We specifically ordered it after finishing the appetizer because we knew it would take awhile to make. We figured that if we ordered it early, then we would get it right after we finished the pizza. We thought wrong. It took an additional 20 minutes after constantly pestering three other waiters. The service was so bad that it left me at a loss for words. Other people who came after us left before we even got our dessert. We didn't even leave the restaurant until around 7:50. I have never felt so disrespected. This sort of treatment is unacceptable. NO ONE should ever be belittled just because of their age and I will NOT be coming back to this location. BTW, I'm not writing a review to try to get compensation. I'm writing one to let others know that it's NOT OKAY to look down on others and treat them unfairly.

I ordered a beer and when it arrived and I started to taste it I was greeted with a lovely grain taste in which that means that the lines need to be cleaned. Of course the bartenders tried stating to our server that nothing was wrong with the beer after they tested it. Second, when our food arrived I noticed immediately a lovely hair on the burger so when I presented it to the waitress I asked her what does this look like and she "" I don't know a string or hair"" I immediately said to her try a hair that was on my burger. She immediately took it back and now I got to watch my wife eat as I waited for a new burger. Now during this entire time, not once did the manager come over to apologize for the beer and definitely not even the food. Until the very last moment is when the manager came over to apologize and stated that my burger will be out in 30 seconds hmmm try another 5 minutes. So for all you people that like to visit Bj's on main st in Huntington Beach I would stay clear of this restaurant for not only will you get crappy beer but you dine with hairy food.

They got rid of the deep dish tins... This is the biggest WTF moment. This is the reason people come here and makes this place unique. What was management thinking? The servers told me HB was the last holdout for the deepdish tins.  If that's the case, I'm sorry to all the other locations as well. 2. Wheat crust on the veggie pizza is no more.

Too many other good pizza joints in hb, and bjs just gave up their signature pizza, the ""California deep dish"" in favor of handtossed.   If you're looking for a handtossed pizza in HB, take a look at pizza lounge or Luggattis or papp joes.  Cheaper and better.

Mathew R.,"Newport Beach, CA",134,212,22,4.0,8/26/2012,"We went here for lunch today and sat outside on the patio to eat. I ordered the Ceasar salad. The food came out pretty fast, and considering all the people there it was quite impressive. Our waitress was very nice and made sure everything was good to go. The salad was really good, I added the blackened chick to it and the portion of the salad is just the right size, not over fed at all which a lot of places have been doing this lately. If you sign up for their rewards card you get a free cookie with some ice cream on top as a reward for signing up with them. It's a points related rewards account that you can ask them to give you a physical card, or you can go to their website and sign up as you're waiting for your food is what we did. After the lunch we got the free desert which tasted great. The cookie was Oreo, and it was topped with ice cream and a cookie flavored whipped topping which tasted great! Eating here, and enjoying the nice weather while people watching and having a great conversation with my girlfriend was a perfect little lunch date for us. She ordered a pizza which she then took some home with us for her to much on later. She loved the pizza, and has eaten here before but since I am new to the area I haven't, but glad I did. Try this place out, gorgeous area to eat a nice lunch or dinner in. They also had a brunch menu that you can choose some other food choices that aren't on the regular menu, it's just for Sunday Brunch. The menu looked pretty good but I didn't decide to get anything off the brunch menu this time.

I took him to dinner here last night and he went crazy over the Caesar Salad with Salmon. I got a Rib Eye and requested it to be cooked medium rare - it came out almost completely burnt. It reminded me of the crappy steaks I got at Sizzler as a kid for 9.95 (only I paid nearly $20 for this disappointment). The side of mashed potatoes was marginal at best, it had to be flakes because I've never seen potatoes that white, naturally. The skewered shrimp was way overcooked to the point of rubbery and they waited until the end of the meal to refill my water, even though I asked at least a half dozen times, throughout the hour I was there to get it filled. My friend also ordered rolls that came out after he finished his salad.  We sat outside and the heater we were next to was turned off, we kept telling the staff that it was off and they insisted it was on (without actually looking up to check) and finally a busboy helped us turn it on so that we weren't freezing during the whole meal. The waiter kept apologizing for forgetting so much stuff and being inattentive, but I still had to pay the full bill. Quit apologizing for bad service and do something about it instead. My experience was abysmal and they weren't that busy, none of this should have occurred. I will never return to this establishment.

The management? Incompetent.  Overall? Be glad I gave you one star, and against my will, at that. I called in an order one night, it was specifically 3 large pizookies. Not that difficult right? After telling me on the phone it would be ready in about 20 minutes, I ambled on down from the beach bonfire that I was at to go pick up the pizookies. Now mind you, this beach bonfire was for my friend's birthday, and we all forgot to buy a cake so we decided to get some pizookies as an alternative. After reaching BJ's, I walk up to the hostess bar and tell them my situation and they look through some receipts(?) looking for my order. They just kind of stammer and say it will be a couple more minutes. Uh, ok, sure, I came about 10 minutes later than you advised to avoid exactly this, but it's not a problem. So I'm standing there against the wall watching T.V. because I left my phone back at the beach, thinking it would only take 10 minutes, MAX. 20 minutes go by and nothing. I go up to the hostess bar and ask how much longer it would take and they give me a vague response full of excuses, ""The kitchen is busy,"" ""The pizookies are being baked fresh,"" ""It's coming right out."" Ok, I'll wait a little longer. I waited about 25 minutes, plus the added 25 minutes they told me it would take over the phone, it can't take that much longer right? WRONG. To make a long story short, I waited a little over 2 hours for my order to come out. By that time I was visibly steaming. Turns out they forgot my order, put in an order, gave my order to the wrong customers (what, is it that difficult to verify a NAME on an order?) and after all that decided to have me just wait there instead of doing anything about it. Now I understand mistakes are a part of human nature, and I'm willing to forgive them for my time wasted. But the thing that really set me off was the way they all tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal and that I was blowing it out of proportion. Management came out and explained all the errors that happened with my order and asked if I would pay with a Visa or mastercard. Wow.

Me and my bf and a few of our friends went to Main St to catch up and eat so we decided on BJs. First of all we asked if the happy hour was the whole restaurant or the bar. The hostess said bar AREA, which usually the tables around the bar in that specific area are included. So we sat in a booth right by the bar.  Our waitress came to get our order and we put in a few drinks, when she came back we asked again what the happy hour specials were, she said they were bar only, and we asked what tables then we could sit in, she pointed to the tall tables litereally 2 feet away from us. We offered to switch but she said it was okay she would acknowledge the happy hour for us, just that the first round of drinks would be normal priced but from then on would be happy hour prices. We were fine with that.  So we ordered the mini pizzas which she CLEARLY gave us the happy hour price on when we ordered and asked, and a few more drinks.  The check came with everything FULL price so of course we brought it to her attention, she said she never said such a thing or said she would actually do it, just that we were not in the tables for happy hour. WTF?! yeah we made it up, she clearly told us what she told us and kept denying it saying she didnt tell us that. so we got a manager.

Chris B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",86,436,516,5.0,9/23/2011,"Mmm, BJ's.......this will be a different review for me. Usually the amount of stars someone receives is directly related to the service or quality I receive. Never have I rated a restaurant so highly that didn't properly cook my dish. Read on. So, I ate at a BJ's once. Probably about 6 or 7 years ago. I don't recall it standing out much. But I was walking from my house to downtown HB the other night to eat....we didn't have any particular restaurant in mind....just kinda aimlessly wandering....till something presented itself.  Well, I've walked by the BJ's a million times....never wanted to try it....had kind of a ""been there, done that"" attitude about it. And my girlfriend says, ""Lets try BJ's""......... Hmmmmm Ok, lets go in. We were pretty much seated immediately even though it was pretty crowded as per the usual. Waiter came over.....very friendly....ordered a garlic bread hamburger and a dinner salad with Blu Cheese. The girlfriend ordered a Calzone.  The salad arrived and I immediately noticed the blu cheese tasted funny...maybe a little too sweet.......not normal blu cheese at all. My girlfriend agreed. But it was edible.  The waiter was very attentive, stopping by several times to make sure everything was ok......when he asked about the salad, I told him it tasted a little funny. Not BAD.....just not that good.  He immediately offered to make another.....but I told him no.........it was necessary.....it wasn't THAT big of a deal. Then he offered to take it off the bill.............but again.....since we'd eaten most of it I told him that no....that's not what I was looking for .......but thanks for the offer.  The entree's arrived and we dug in.  Everything was good.....but something wasn't ""right'........Hmmmm then it hit me.....my burger wasn't hot. It was just barely warm.....as were the fries.  Hmmmm, then my girlfriend commented her calzone was good....but not hot either. I tried a bit.....and yep....just warm.  Oh well....took another bite....then she commented.....""Cazone is like pizza, it's supposed to be too hot to eat the first couple minutes...""  She was right.....it's supposed to release steam when you cut it open....what the heck? this was warm like....ordered it to go.....drove over picked it up..brought it home and took it out of the box 30 minutes after it came out of the oven warm.  So here comes our happy, helpful, cheery waiter..... ""Hows everything?"" So while my girlfriend didn't want to be a bother......I simply asked, ""my burgers not hot.....can you nuke it for a minute for me?""   He immediately asked if I wanted him to have a new burger made.....""No, I just want it warmed up."" It was a delish burger....just not hot..... So he took my plate and my girlfriend continued on with her calzone. He stopped by a moment later and said he asked the manager to stop by........Uh oh.....now I'm in trouble.  So the manager stops by,  ""I hear your burger wasn't cooked properly?"" ""No, it was fine.....just not hot....I asked him to warm it up. And my girlfriends calzone wasn't hot either"" ""Well, I'm having the kitchen cook you a new hamburger"" "" I apologize for it not being hot.....and I'll take the calzone off the bill"" ""We want to make SURE you are completely satisfied with your food and service here""  Whoa I just wanted it nuked.  But then I thought about it.....wow, WHEN was the last time I had a manager come over like that?  I know when a server asks ""How is everything?"" They don't REALLY care.....they're just being (usually) polite.  But I still somehow think.....that when I mention (and NOT asking for replacement or anything) that the hollandaise is too lemony or the eggs should be runny or the blu cheese isn't right.....that maybe they'll go back and tell the cook.......""hey, someone mentioned this and you should check it out....."" that maybe it's constructive criticism and just might be helpful. Now I know that may not be true most of the time....but as a business owner I'D want to know....so.... The burger comes back......nice and hot.....it really is a very good burger....everything's good (cept I'm eating by myself, the girlfriend having already finished) The waiter comes and drops off the bill......and not only did the manager take off the calzone but he took off the burger as well.  Wow!  So he essentially took what would have been a really disappointing meal and turned it totally around and made up for it and then some. If it had been ""business as usual"" like EVERY other time you have a disappointment during a meal.....I likely would have never walked in a  BJ's again.  But now as a result of the extraordinary attention the manager paid to my experience there.....I'm looking forward to going back.  Other restaurants take notice......see how that works?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=300

Some of the workers were just standing around laughing and doing nothing productive.  My friends and I ordered and it took the longest time for the waiter to bring out our food. We only ordered a medium pizza.. We asked for water with lemon, and they forgot to bring out our lemon.. It's not that hard to cut some lemon up and bring it to your customers.  Afterwards, we ordered 3 mini pizookies and that still took quite a long time, and our ice cream was all melted.. So what I thought was..,'it doesn't take ice cream to melt that fast when it's being walked over and the cookie is just a little warm.. right? Or am I wrong? THEN, I accidentally dropped my spoon, asked this random waitress to get me another one POLITELY, and this girl NEVER came back with a new spoon.. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT MY DESSERT? UGH.  Anyway, my overall experience here sucked, but the only exception for this place for deserving a single star is the pizookie, since the delicious cookie was baked to perfection.

Knowing this, tonight we decided to try and circumvent this problem by simply phoning in an order.  This time took the cake. After being on hold for seven minutes, we had my mom call in to see if she could talk to someone.  The host picked up, and told her that she would have to wait on hold.  My mom asked how many people were on hold ahead of her.  The host said nobody was.  Are you kidding? This location does not deserve your business. These problems seem to be specific to this location -- I've been to others and have never had terrible service like this.  But we'll never return to this location and strongly encourage others who don't want to put up with such terrible service to do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=360

AJ W.,"Newport Beach, CA",12,26,,3.0,9/21/2010,"After checking out the booths of organic produce, surf photography and Himalayan wool beanies at the Farmer's Market on Main Street in HB my girlfriend and I were hungry.  I told her any place she liked was fine with me, and we ended up wandering into this BJ's and had a pretty good experience.   The first thing I noticed walking in was how nice the place looked.  It's a scaled down version of the larger Bj's you're used to, kind of a blend of an upscale pub and the franchise.  The bar area has lots of high-tops, lots of screens for sports and nice long bar for bellying up to and ordering your favorite poison.  The second thing I noticed was how loud the place was.  Am I getting old or does anyone else cringe at the thought of having to shout your dinner conversation?   We were given the choice of waiting on an outside table or being sat right away inside, and chose inside.  Sadly the open table was on the bar perimeter and I could barely hear the hostess tell us the usual ""our specials are...and your server will be with you shortly"".  So we decided to wait for the outside table, which was actually available right away.  The outside seating consists of a patio area at the front and some two-tops along the side which gives you good people watching time. I know people like getting the pizzas here, but I'm the kind of guy who goes to burger joints for burgers and pizza parlors for pizza.  They do it best and much cheaper.  It doesn't mean I don't do it occasionally though. Ok, off my soapbox... My girlfriend ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes and I got the Italian Market Salad with vinagrette dressing (I'm still doing the no-carb thing ok?  Don't you think I wanted something else and wash it down with beer?  Well I did, but I didn't). The food was good (my girlfriend brought half the chicken home) and we enjoyed being outside people watching and actually being able to hear each-other.  I think the waiter may have forgotten us a couple of times, but no matter, we were in no hurry and he didn't forget us for long. All in all, the meal was about $30 for both of us and we walked away satisfied. Oh, and they validate your stub for the parking structure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=360

The hot tea was lukewarm, the table was dirty, and the pulled pork sandwich was not up to par. The coleslaw was dry and chopped too big. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious and the pizza was good. The shrimp tacos were atrocious. The guacamole tasted like green sour cream and the tortilla tasted like plain flat bread. The busboy Jordan was awful he left numerous empty plates and cups on our table after walking by and passing us 4 times. Instead of cleaning our table he went and talked to the homeless man that stands right next to the patio cussing, yelling, and making inappropriate balloon figures. It made us very uncomfortable.

It's a lot smaller than other bjs, but it's still pretty cozy inside.  It's a good change from all the other bars on main st. They still have the happy hour specials and lunch specials that you are used to having from all the other bjs. It right on main st and you can have a really great view of all the hot eye candy on a nice day if u sit out in the patio area. I'm glad they added a full bar here now so u can just come here have a drink and chill when u don't feel like sitting in one of the loud bars here. Plus u can have a pizookie when the munchies kick in hehe  Just to let u guys know only the taller tables are considered the bar area, so if you're there for happy hour, u have to sit at the bar or on one of the high tables. I didn't really take time to rate the food because you should already know the food is bomb! My faves are of course the pizookies then the great white pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, the pesto flat bread, and the roasted turkey cobb sandwich.

Hands down, my favorite beer on the planet is the Jeremiah Red!  The service there is always great, they must pay better or make better tips because they are always friendly, happy and helpful.

I am saddened by the poor attempt at bfast. My wife and I went on a Saturday. The menu is limited, especially for the health conscious. The food we received was fresh, but undercooked and bland.

I called 2 weeks in advance to make the reservations, I figured that would be more than enough time. I made the reservation at 8pm for 25-30 people. Some of my party arrived at 7:30 so they went to the front desk and let them know so the hostess gave them the buzzer for when the table will be ready. I arrived at 8pm and went to the front desk to check the status on our tables, the hostess said maybe another 5-20 minutes. I thought OK that's not too bad. Here comes 8:30 and now my guests are all standing outside waiting to go. I went back to the hostess and she said ""you can go back there they are just cleaning the tables"" ok so you want us to stand there while they clean the tables? Awesome! The manager did come up to me and say she is sorry for the late sitting but they had a party there before mine. Which was fine, but then more and more of my guests arrived and come to find out the room I had reserved only fit 25 people max. So now I had about 4 of my guest just standing around and ended up leaving. I had also let my party know to make sure they get there parking ticket validated so they wont have to pay. When we left BJ's we went to the car and got up to the pay booth and the gentleman said it was $13.00!!!!! Turns out BJ's only takes off $!!.

J C.,"Highland, CA",1,33,2,1.0,4/22/2011,"You've gotta work hard to get 1 star, and these clowns really put in the consistent extra effort.   First, yes the service is that bad.  Be it the incompetence, disinterest, or attitude it's all too true.  Don't expect the ""management"" or should i say mismanagement to help any either.  Tried this place on a few occasions and ok, places get swamped and things can fall off once in a while but this is a trend here, not an exception.  Read around the reviews and the pattern is clear.  The owners are lucky that there's a constant flow of tourists and visitors to the area to keep this joke going.  I don't know about you but if I read about the sort of crap that so many have remarked about here on yelp and other review sites, I'd close shop for a week and exterminate the vermin responsible for ruining what should be a solid business model. Gotta give props to the beer selection and a few of their bartenders- they realize they need to work for a living at least.  The food is, let's face it, chain fare which is only average at the best of times but you can't knock it for being what it is if you knew about that in the first place.  ON the other hand you can hit up a drive thru Pizza Hut, save a lot of $$$ and aggravation and be just as grease bloated later.  Again, food isn't the real problem here per se. Why do this to yourself or your so called friends when there are all kinds of superior alternatives to this planned community chain strip mall abortion of a restaurant located in a prime main st location?  It needs to be torn down and buried in Irvine somewhere and something useful put in its place.  There are dozens of great alternatives on and off main st - Cafe Alessa or Lugatti's on 5th (reopened recently thank god!) are both solid bets with none of the bullshit attitude staff and mediocre food.  Trust me on this one, you won't be disappointed!  Or you most likely will be if you don't...  Invest your time and money better elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=320

Well low and behold... we get to the hostess and she tells us there is no such reservation and is sure we made it for the wrong BJ's. Well good uncle that he was, recited the manager's name as well as the address and that stuck it to her. After that small debacle, we were seated about 10 minutes later in what looked to be a very shiestily put together set of 3 tables in the back room. These chairs even after they were scooted in were about 5 inches away from the adjacent tables with people sitting at them. Not comfy at all. Well our families asked for separate checks and the waitress didn't mind splitting up the already ordered drinks so props to her. All in all the food was pretty good... pulled pork sandwich, spinach and artichoke dip, buffalo wings (With ranch sans blue cheese), and buffalo chicken pizzas for our half of the family. The food came relatively quick considering a party of 13 people and all the food coming out at once, so thanks again there. We then proceeded to order dessert, delicious pazookies (one large platter for the larger half of the family and a small cookies n' creme for my sister and I to share). That was great as well... And.. the reason they lost a second star was due to the 15-20 minute wait after getting the bill to take our cards to be processed. We had immediately put them in, when we received the check, so I'm not sure why the hostess who by the way was right next to us at the computer half the time didn't see... oh well.

I have never before seen this many people congregated in one spot...both buying healthy, organic and locally sourced fresh food...and chain smoking cigarettes! What a delightful, yet haunting contrast. We dropped by the aforementioned BJ's (Official Motto - ""No, we didn't know what that meant when we named it"") and had bowl of soup and a chili-burger...it took us 90 minutes to have this little repast. The service was (how shall I put this)...uneven. We were seated and we waited...and waited...and then...we waited. Finally, our waiter showed up with the explanation that some people called in sick (probably smoking related) and they were short handed...but he was nice and the place was nice enough, so we thought we were in no hurry. That turned out to be a good attitude to bring! While the food was OK, everyone was nice and just as sorry for the delays as could be, etc...that turned out to be the theme...forgotten utensils, forgotten drink orders, incorrect food orders and apologies. ""Oop's"" and an apology...doesn't that pretty much sum up BJ's? They did offer us a free cookie to make up for the troubles, and it was OK...white chocolate macadamia nut cookie...all warm, white, thick, gooey and sticky. What...you didn't think I was going to let this little review end without another shot at a double entendre, did you? Two stars for this sloppy BJ.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=320
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,156,32,2.0,6/3/2013,"The good: They take reservations for groups (I think more than 6?), which is really nice on crowded days. It's also just a couple of blocks from the pier, which I loved. And it's BJ's so the food is good! The Not so good: While I loved the location, that was about it. They do validate parking, but the parking is pretty bad since it is by the beach. Also, the service was...interesting. I had a fly in my drink and thought it was very noticeable but it was brushed off as not being a big deal. I then ordered a cheese pizza. However, the waiter thought I said 5 meat. So, the serve brought out the pizza and I said it wasn't mine. He then went to the back and brought it out and said it was mine and brought the waiter out to tell me it was mine. I told him what I ordered and he said that item didn't exist  (I saw it on there and have gotten it at other BJs in the past). After telling him I saw it on the menu, he left a little frustrated and carless and came back to tell me it would be out soon. When it did come out it wasn't good very well.  It is also very, very loud so you can't hear what someone is saying unless they are next to you. I give it 2 stars because I was with a medium sized party and people make mistakes. Also the rest of my part liked their food and didn't have any problems. I just don't like being told I'm wrong multiple times when I say I saw something on the menu. Although the problems were quietly brushed over, my meal was comped. I laughed it off and it was fine, but I will probably choose a different BJs in the future unless I am near the beach.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=320

My friend asked for her usual and the server said she couldn't get that at lunchtime so she had to change her order to a flatbread with salad and I got a personal pizza with soup. I received my soup about 20 minutes before my friend got her food and never got refills horrible service!!!! When the food runner came with my soup I asked him to check on her salad an he explained it came with her meal even though she preferred it before our food like I did with my soup. When we finally got our food after waiting for 25 minutes after I got my soup which is ridiculous with how slow the restaurant was my bacon pizza had barely any bacon on it, so the nice food runner got me more bacon without my asking. We asked his name because he was the only one in the whole resteraunt who took care of us and it was Hugo.  Hugo then refilled our drinks while the waitress was out of sight. She never checked back and then finally dropped off our check. I never got her name because bjs employees don't wear name tags, but I wish I would have.

I'm only rating this place 3-stars because the staff all seemed to have attitude from the bus boy to the server - no one seemed very happy that we were there and that we were crowded around a table at the bar.  We really were no trouble.  We just ate our pizookie and left quickly.  Thanks for the yummy dessert but no thanks for the attitude!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=340

JacqueLin O.,"Long Beach, CA",343,189,138,2.0,9/20/2010,"This past weekend, I was in HB getting my hair done by the LOVELY Thao at One Stop. My appointment was at the crack of dawn, and I figured since I was in the area I might as well visit main street and meet up with some of my friends who live in HB.  We decided we wanted to get breakfast/brunch on main street. We were shocked how packed it was at 10:00 am, so we decided we'd try BJ's weekend brunch. I had seen signs and I was curious.  It wasn't the nicest day in HB. There was overcast and it wasn't very warm out yet.  The place was empty, and there was this group of people standing in the front waiting, the waiters/hosts seemed really confused and unorganized. Two different ones came in to sit us, and it seemed really out of order. I decided we should sit inside because it was chilly and even though the host tried to entice us by saying there was ""heated patio"" I shook my head and we went inside.  The guy who gave us the menus neglected to give us the breakfast menus, so at first we thought maybe they didn't serve breakfast or something. Another employee came over and we asked for the breakfast menu. It wasn't a huge variety, I'd say maybe under 10 menu options. I was pretty hungry at this point, so mostly everything looked somewhat interesting. I decided to get the steel cut oats and a side of eggs. I didn't care to be TOO adventurous, I just wanted to eat.  My friend ordered an Italian sausage omelet. We both ordered coffees and water. After we ordered, my friend immediately noticed that the waiter didn't ask us what kind of toast we wanted, or what kind of meat we wanted. We hoped this wouldn't determine the rest of our experience there.  It was SO cold in the restaurant, my coffee wasn't staying warm for longer than a few moments. Our food was brought out and it looked good, but sure enough, the toast was white our sourdough and BOTH of us wanted wheat. The person who brought out our food wasn't' the same person who took our order, so I asked him if I could have wheat toast instead.  I could feel huge gusts of cold air, and it bothered me because I knew my food would get cold quickly. The oats were mediocre. They came with milk, brown sugar, and some mixed dried fruit. They weren't piping hot and with the AC on and windows opened, they had NO chance.  The waiter didn't ask us if we wanted hot sauce or ketchup and the food was SO bland, it was necessary. By the time I got to my eggs they were cold, hard and rubbery. I was VERY disappointed. We actually had to flag down a guy because our waiter was no where to be found to ask for hot sauce and ketchup. At this point, I already felt very disappointed. Our waiter didn't come by to check on us, coffee was cold and food was cold and less than exciting.  It was right before we called it quits when our waiter finally came over to ask if everything was okay. At that point, there really was no saving of our meals.  I'm officially not a fan of BJ's. MAYBE I'll come by for the pizookie but my last two experiences have been less than satisfactory.  It was TOO cold, the service was BAD and the food was unremarkable. I would DEFINITELY say to pass BJ's if you're looking for breakfast in HB.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=340

It was very busy on Sunday, but the food was great, service was good too. I enjoyed the roast beef dip sandwich (4*) one night and the  following night I had chicken strips (4*) - the chicken was great, but the mashed potatoes were cold. Their Desserts are awesome!  I had the BJ's Baked Beignet one night and the next night I tried Apple Berry Burst Crumble.  Both were 5*  The only problem is the ice cream melts too fast because both dishes are served hot, but they were sure delish!

Kevin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,143,1,2.0,7/5/2010,"Not impressed.  Those are the words that come to mind when I think about the dinner I ordered here last weekend. I met up with a friend.  I put my name on the list at the HB Beer Company across the street but there was a UFC fight going on, so the wait was going to be an hour-and-a-half.  Soooo, we thought we'd eat somewhere else and then come back later to the HBBC for a few steins.   We walked over to BJ's and were seated within 5 minutes, which was nice.  The waiter was pleasant and took care of us quick. But, I ended up being bummed with the place, and here's why: My friend and I were each going to order a salad, but the server told us that the Garden Medley salad, which my friend was ordering, would serve two people no problem, so we ordered that to split. The waiter brings the salad, which looked uninspired - I mean it was a mound of chopped romaine and a few diced tomatoes - and it was definitely not a salad that would easily feed two people.  It didn't taste as bland as it looked; in fact, I'd even go so far as to say it was ""okay,""  but the server was mistaken in saying it would be enough for two.   It suddenly occurred to me that I was eating at a chain restaurant. I ordered the Angel Hair Toscana, a simple dish with a menu description that made it sound appetizing and relatively healthy to eat.  Problem was, the pasta itself tasted like it had been boiled in water that had been re-used 50 times that day.  It just had an off-putting  taste. To the manager's credit, she took the pasta dish off the bill and she was nice about it, but I won't be going back.

Amy K.,"Irvine, CA",595,754,1040,3.0,9/29/2007,"This is one of the louder BJ's locations.  Tonight they were packed when we got seated after a 25 minute wait at 8:00 pm.  There were several groups of people in their late teens/early 20s.  It gets pretty loud here, plus there are TVs with sports on, so when it's a good game, bring your ear plugs. The food and service was good.  I had the halibut fish tacos which were very tasty breaded in panko and lightly fried.  The flour tortillas were lightly grilled giving them a good texture, and they use various cabbage giving the tacos a good texture.  On the side, the tacos came with red, blue, and yellow corn tortilla chips.  While very colorful, the chips are just okay.  I did eat some of my friend's seasoned potato wedges, and they were really good!  Once I tried one, I didn't want to stop eating them.  Lucky for me, she isn't a fried-food fan, so I ate most of them off her plate. I also ordered a glass of the lemonade, which turned out to be pink lemonade.  It was nice and tart, and the pink sugar around the edge of the glass was a nice touch.  I wasn't offered a refill on the lemonade, so I don't know if they have complimentary refills or not. For dessert, my group shared two Pizzaokies, one chocolate chip and one half peanut butter and half macadamia nut.  Since I can't eat ice cream (lactose intolerant), I just ate some of the warm cookies.  I really liked the peanut butter and how it was loaded with peanuts.  The chocolate chip was super chocolaty.  Our group of 6 polished them both off. My biggest complaint with this location of BJ's is the restroom situation.  It's a fairly large restaurant, and yet there is only a single men's restroom and a single women's restroom.  When I got there I wanted to wash my hands, and I had to wait in line almost 10 minutes.  Why on earth didn't they make bigger restrooms with multiple stalls?   I did enjoy my dinner, but this location is definitely the worst BJ's I've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=420

I do not know why .. but I used to have nothing but great experiences here ... for food and service .. HOWEVER: they obviously recently did a remodel of some kind and I must say I HATE IT .. They added an indefinite bar area .. I am sure because it brings in a lot of money and now they have the TV area for sports games and all like surrounding bars etc .. however because they added the bar the dinging seating is very limited and very compact ... I recently ate here .. this past week in fact .. and was seated in the back where it felt like I was next to all my surrounding tables and was immersed in their conversations and families .. The ""booth"" I was sitting in was small and cramped .. only big enough to barely fit myself on one side and one person on the other side .. Very uncomfortable and not what you want to fell when you want to relax at dinner .. If I want to sit that close to my neighbor I will sit at the bar .. Also because the tables are so close the waiters and waitresses are constantly bumping your elbow or you and it is annoying ..

The Pizookie, if you don't know is the awesomely delicious, warm, 10"" cookie they give you with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. There are a few types of pizookie's i'm going to talk about the original. But like i said, my meal was all good until i got to the dessert. About half way into the yummy thang, i was about to take a bite....and all of a sudden i saw a hair. This wasn't any old hair...it was curly and had a distinct look to it. I swear it was a pubic hair. I was so sick to my stomach i almost threw up. But see, i'm not going to be the guest who complains and wants a new one. To tell you the truth there would be no way i could eat another one and i wouldn't want to waste it. So instead i left a little note on a napkin with my fork stabbed into the piece of cookie with the cooked pubic hair in it. It said:  ""Give my compliments to the cook, thanks for the pubes in my cookie""  Then i left a small tip and left. I know it wasn't the servers fault so i'm not going to penalize her tip for the idiot who doesn't wash his hands in the kitchen. So from that experience i will never go there again for the pizookie.

Throughout our meal, a manager and a couple other servers asked how i was doing and even helped to pick up the car my son had thrown on the floor.

Alyssa T.,"Lawndale, CA",107,30,6,2.0,1/13/2009,"First off let me just say that I looove their food. I've never had a bad meal at any of their locations and just thinking about their pizza makes me want a slice right now. The big downside at this particular location was the service. It's right by the beach, so they are often busy with foot traffic but the service was still unacceptable even though I factored that in. My boyfriend and I were told there would be about a 15 minute wait so we had the hostess put one of our names down and we stayed close by. I'd say at least 40 minutes passed until I got fed up and asked the new hostess who just went on duty what was going on. Turns out the other hostess didn't write us down at all! They then seated us as quickly as possible. We were starving at that point and very thirsty on a hot day so I was also let down when they sat us and no one bothered to come by and give us water or check on us for 10 minutes. We were trapped in a weird corner so we got ignored by out ditsy male waiter who would only giggle and say ""my bad"" about everything he did wrong, which wasn't all that funny to me. We ordered an appetizer only to have it come out mere seconds before our entrees so that was rather useless. I usually tip a minimum of 15% but this was the first time I was compelled to tip less. If you want good pizza AND good service, go to BJ's on Beach Blvd right by the 405 freeway instead. Their staff has always been nice and attentive.

I then asked a busser if we had to order at the bar and he said somebody would be over. 5 min later we were paged for our table on the patio-except it wasn't on the patio so we went back to the table to wait.  5 more minutes go by and nobody comes or acknowledges us. I stand up with my credit card to get drinks and a server immediately comes over to get our drink order-so after we placed the order, you guested it! we waited another 5 minutes for drinks-so we are at about 25 min so far for our 1st drink to arrive. We order food immediately and once we get it there is no silverware, napkins, etc. Sooo we have to get it ourselves. Nobody follows up with us until we flag another server down to get another round of drinks, and then another to get our bill.

My favorite entree is the Moroccan Spiced Salmon served with Sauteed Vegetable CousCous covered with a tasty, mildly spicy, Roasted Red Pepper Sauce. Of course, all of their Pizzas are excellent. Even my old standby, the Classic Combo (Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushroom), is extremely satisfying. Their full bar has everything you can imagine and they have several unique beers on tap as well. Service is always friendly and efficient. My only complaint is the noise level. When the restaurant is full it is hard to carry on a conversation with your dinner mates as it is just too loud.

The floorplan is actually smaller then most BJ's due to its tight location in downtown HB. If you go on a busy day, you will probably have a hard time getting seated within 15-20 minutes.  I went on new years day and was able to get a seat within 5 minutes of entrance. Most times you will just have to try your luck because the line does run out into the street. I am really curious, so what exactly is considered a deep dish here? I got a regular pizza and it was thicker then pizza hut, dominos and round table. I am assuming you get bread with cheese and toppings if you order their deep dish pizza. This is one of the few places where you can order 2 different types of chicken on your pizza. They do charge you double the price of a topping, but that is understandable.  I also ordered the chicken fetucinni and I was few minutes past the lunch hour, but the waiter still hooked me up with a lunch price. I thought that was really cool indeed. I always loved BJ's menu and all the original beer they have on tap.

But I happen to go to this small as BJ's off Main st. in Huntintgton... one of the worst experience in my life. Ok first off it was great that we got sat in like 10mins but this place is tiny, you're bumping elbows with everyone. and there was one bath room stall for each sexes. And there was no bar. No happy hour, pre made cocktails... thank god they had beer. Our server was fine, she just kept forgetting to bring me ketchup. And to top the night... the parking arrangement for that whol complex sucks... I mean it blows! You can only validate at restaraunts on that initial building... I parked at the parking lot near the beachfront grill, and don't get me started on that scene. So I asked if she could validate my parking and she said thats not the yello ticket we can't validate it. No I'm sorry, no ""yeah that sucks, they really should change that"" nothing to acknowledge how upset I am about the situation, and she quickly ignored me to do something else... I work at a restaraunt, and I know how some parking lots can gauge people and I totally take the sides of my guests. I ended up paying 2 dollars for parking cause it was all the cash I had, and its only cash only, I was suppose to pay 4 dollars. Ok, (1. they should make a sign about validations in the structure. (2. Some sincerity would be nice from my waitress. (3. I got sick from eating their sliders there... And when I rate  I usually give restaraunts the benefit of the doubt, cause I know what its like... but this place and the whole complex... Just something about going to the beach where everyone are ass holes... I dunno... I'm more pissed now thinking about it.... so not dissing BJ's, they have a great bar menu and happy hour... but steer clear of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-huntington-beach-2?start=440

Shortly after he came back and said he needed us to do the math ourselves because he was to confused.

Instead of actually having the server do his job to calculate it her response was ""Well it is confusing and he is to busy to calculate it.""

Chelsea H.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,11,6,1.0,4/11/2015,"I went to BJ's hoping for good food and friendly service after a long day at the beach with my friends. When we came in to ask for a table, the hostess treated us with a manner that made us feel disrespected. We felt because we looked young, she treated us with a rude manner, like we were going to dine and dash or something. Personally, I felt extremely disrespected and I was disappointed. The wait time to get a table was pretty reasonable, but after we sat down, the wait time for our food was OUTRAGEOUSLY UNREASONABLE. We got our appetizer (Spinach and Artichoke Dip) 20 minutes after we sat down and it took another 40 minutes to get our entree (4 slices of BBQ Chicken Pizza). We decided to order 3 mini pizookies when we finished our appetizer, because we knew it would take awhile to make, but 30 minutes after we finished our pizza, we FINALLY received our dessert after asking a couple different waiters/waitresses. What's the point of telling your waitress ahead of time if it's going to take the same amount of time or even longer? Also, our waitress didn't even bother to check up on us, while she checked on others and I felt like we were treated unfairly.

We ordered a pizza and asked for bacon on 3/4 since my daughter is vegetarian- and the two guys wanted extra  sauce. The waitress said she would request triple sauce. The pizza came, had bacon everywhere and not one spot of sauce that we could see with the naked eye. She brought the manager over and he said he'd have a new one made. Since we were really hungry, the others of us said that if he would just bring some sauce we could continue to munch on that one until the new pizza came. He came back about 10 minutes later with a tiny ramekin of sauce. Then when the second pizza came, the waitress took the remainder of the first pizza to box for us to take home (it was actually a very good pizza) and we started on the new one. This time, barely any sauce and some pieces of bacon on my daughter's portion. Not a big deal- we just wanted to eat and get out of there. Then the waitress came back- said the manager took the other pizza from her and ""got rid of it"".  We ended up being there a very long time- no offer of a comp drink, dessert or any type of compensation for the bungled pizza.

We waited and waited some more. Finally, the waiter told us that he had forgotten to put our order in and apologized. My husband asked him to comp one of the drinks and he said he'd see what he could do. Some woman came out, presumably a manager, she didn't identify herself, and asked us how things were going. We said fine and she left. I guess that was what we got for having to wait so long for our food. My poor husband had worked an 11 hour day, was tired and hungry.
