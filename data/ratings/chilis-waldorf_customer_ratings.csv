51,Ed C.,"Cheltenham, MD",0,19,,2.0,2013-10-01,"Had lunch today.  Ordered a ""Triple Combo"" to share and a bowl of chili.  My wife had a plate of nachos.  We also ordered iced tea -- $5.18!  That was a bit much for a couple of glasses of tea.  The combo had southwestern egg rolls -- not bad, spinach dip -- just as good as out of a jar, and boneless honey-chipotle wings -- pretty much flavor free.  The chili -- way too much cumin and way to little meat.  Pretty disappointing for a place that call's itself ""Chili's"".  Maybe it's named after a fat guy who shivers a lot.  The chili was more like soup.  The service was good.  Our server was attentive but did not hover. Of course, Waldorf is pretty much a wasteland as far as decent food goes.  So, I'm sure Chili's is at the top of the list for plenty of the locals.  I'll stay home when I'm in the mood for chili or open a can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

54,Elizabeth W.,"Brandywine, MD",3,7,2.0,1.0,2014-05-08,"My boyfriend and I decided to do an early dinner here since we found some unused gift certificates from Christmas. We usually don't eat at chain restaurants so we thought we would give it a try. The food wasn't great. I had the shrimp tacos that were bland and Em had a chicken sandwich. The service and management was awful. The waitress actually told us she forgot that we were her table. She forgot half out meal so our sides came 15 min after our entree. We didn't realize we had to use the pos system to pay and got attitude when we asked for our bill. I tried paying with the gift cards and the system wouldn't let me use them so I asked the waitress. She took then in the back and got the manager To try and help. She came back and said they wouldn't work but the manager could come over. Well it was an obvious struggle to get her to come because we watched her walking around aimlessly for 15 min before coming. She told me there was nothing she could do and would not honor them. I am 100% sure they have not been used and was offended by being accused of using blank gift cards. In the end we spent money we wouldn't have at a restaurant for average food, bad wait staff, and a terrible management. All corporate did was give us one free meal. That does not cover everything we spent money wise and I have no need to ever go back to that place!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=40,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

37,Sal G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",19,76,125.0,3.0,2014-08-03,"On this particular day recently I just felt like eating fajitas so I stepped on in. The place wasn't busy at all but the girl who brought me over the menu told me it would be a wait of like 35-40 mins for fajitas. I really couldn't be arsed so I ended up going for a burger instead. It was the usual alright quality but it was a sloppy second considering I really wanted a sizzling plate full of chicken and beef fajitas.  In the end the burger was tasty and the fries were not just warm for a change. Two beers rounded out this wee pit stop quite nicely and I left a satisfied chap that early afternoon. I couldn't figure out why it would have taken the kitchen so long to bring out certain food if the place was pretty dead. It was disappointing, almost as much as the table I was led to on arrival. Possibly the vestiges of the previous night's last patron; the last waiter/waitress could have easily followed Mr Miyagi's ""wax on, wax off"" self-help advice, as it would've certainly come in handy. I've been here a few times now, and this was probably the first time I had slightly below-par service.

I've been to this place a few times, but these last two times gave me the blues!  The wait staff were very nice and attentive when they were at the table, but it was the quality of the food & the dishes that the food was served on was what made us leave! So the first disappointment was getting our drinks, yes that's right we didn't even make it passed that, we ordered a glass of sprite and some hot tea.  They were brought out to us w/a smile!  It was when I got ready to take a sip when I realized what I did, the hot tea cup had lipstick stains on it, and the sprite had black floating debris in it!!  So I called the waiter to take it away and bring us another of both... he returned and this time the tea cup had a hair floating in it!!  At this point my husband was fed up and said look I can't sit here in confidence thinking that the food will be any better, if bringing us a CLEAN cup and a drink w/out mold/dirt in it was an issue; with that being said we left! I decided to go back w/a friend this time and see if it was maybe just that day that things were off... WRONG!  This time my friend ordered and when it was brought to her it seemed like the food was literally made on the plate and given to her all sloppy then you could see where they didn't even try to combine the seasonings in it & when she still decided to try it and see how it was she ended up spitting it back out immediately, they had put in too much hot spices so it made the dish inedible.  They did send the manager over and asked if it would be ok for them to make her another plate to replace that one she agreed to it, that one was much better, but it just seemed like it was a frozen dish that was microwaved and they sprinkled some seasoning on top...SMH.  It's unfortunate because we really liked going to Chilli's, I'm not goin to this one ever again!  & if you decide to go on your own, Good LUCK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=20,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

So I ordered the appetizer when she took my meal order, and it came out after my meal (59 mins later). Every time the waitress came by, she'd say she'd check on in, but in the end I just had them take it back and make it to go. The food taste was marginal to OK compared to other Chili's.

42,Trish J.,"Newport News, VA",2,14,11.0,1.0,2015-08-02,"I posted this in another review page, and now adding here, this occurred in June 2015. I walked in and stood at the area where the hostess checks in guests. The hostess never made eye-contact or greeted me and my guest. We stood there and continued to look at her, she never looked at us or acknowledged us and we were standing directly in front of her. Then someone who looked like he could be a manager asked me and my guest to excuse him as he was trying to walk in the path we were standing in, never dawned on him to ask if we were assisted yet, clearly greeting customers as they arrive is not a priority, but we patiently stood there for 5 minutes, even after that happened. It was about 2pm in the afternoon, and there were empty tables, so it wasn't a matter of a busy lunch rush, after five more minutes my guest and I left and enjoyed a great meat at a place walking distance away.

10,Danielle M.,"Bushwood, MD",172,9,19.0,3.0,2016-02-10,"I decided to go to Chili's Happy Hour in Waldorf, MD because of the great happy hour prices. Chili's Happy Hour is Mon-Fri from 2pm-8pm (BAR ONLY) which is a great because it gives you more of a open window. I have been here 3 times so far for the happy hour. The first two times were cool. I was able to get a good seat and was pleased with my visit. When it comes to bar food, it is pretty much idiot proof unless you chef/cooks are just plan inexperienced. The food is nothing to celebrate over but it's good enough to help coat your stomach for the alcohol. The servers are cool but, overworked. Apparently today, the server on staff is by himself and overwhelmed. I walked in the bar today to a packed house with about 2-3 cocktail tables. I had to ask the host to clean a table off for me in a corner section of the bar. He was pleasant and didn't hesitate. My server, not sure what his name is because he never introduced himself, was running all over the place. I sat down at 6:11pm and I took about 7 mins for him to give me a menu, which I told him I knew what I wanted. I order the wings(fried hard), a glass of red wine and a margarita for later.  The kitchen was pretty fast because by 6:29 I had my food. Piping Hot! So word of advice, let your wings sit alittle. My margarita came and I forgot to tell my speedy Gonzalez server no salt around the rim. Once again I wasn't asked, which I'm used too. So I asked if they could make another? He offered to wipe the rim off instead of making a new one. I told him that regardless some salt ended up in the glass and I will taste it. He kind of looked at me like it was a issues but called the manager on his little walkie talkie and said ""I need the Margarita to come off"" then, he said loud enough for me to hear ""No! It's not our fault"". I'm like WTF? Broadcast? When he returned I had a margarita in a DRITY GLASS. Then, the restaurant cleared, my server disappeared.  The only reason I am not giving Chili's a 2 star is because of my pervious two visits. I will try again but and reevaluate if my next experience is better.

Can't mess up fajitas and a drink.  We saw the server far and few during this visit.   Came back again on a Saturday. Sat down at 2:00 in the bar area (no one was in the front so we seated ourselves).  Finally after seeing no servers we were about to get up and get menus when a server arrived at our table. We placed our drink order (water and an iced tea as well as a margarita).  Ten minutes (2:10) later we placed our food orders, after the server took orders of tables that came in after us, yes, we needed a few minutes to look at the menu but when he finally returned, he should have taken our order first.  At 2:40 our food arrived...2:40...a salad and fajitas......totally unacceptable, as again, there were about 6-8 tables being served in the entire restaurant at the time of our visit. Why did it take 30 minutes for our food?  I ended up cancelling the margarita with the server who looked bewildered...but evidently he never put the order in or it was never sent to the table, either way...unacceptable. There also was a big disparity in the fajitas. We ordered the same dish on our prior visit and the quantity in no way compared to what we received this visit. The kitchen was throwing a loud party on Saturday, which I assume is why the food took so long coming out and was plentiful.?? Doubt I will go back here again.  Management really needs to step up to the plate on this place, I am sure they see the horrible reviews. Will also be sending this review to corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

We got there between 8:45 & 9:00pm and we were having a really nice dinner until your staff that was hanging out at the take out pick up area decided to have a loud conversation. My wife and I could not even hear ourselves speaking to each other because they were so loud! AJ came by to check on us and asked if we needed anything else and we told him no but the people back there are really loud and he said he would relay the message but I guess they were not happy after they got the message and got even louder. One lady started loudly expressing after she obviously got her new work schedule, awww hell nawww, awww hell nawww I ain't working no weekends, I mean really!!!! A new staff is what you need Chilli's because these grown folks that was working need some taming in a bad way. One girl on staff made sure as she was leaving to yell at everyone Goodbye yall. My feelings on that is, if you had feelings about me saying you were to loud then you should have stopped by my table and we could  have handled it right there on the spot instead of walking out the door yelling and getting in your mother's van that came to pick you up. Your staff is rude besides AJ who handled us professionally. Thank you AJ and Chilli's you don't have to worry about seeing us anymore you ruined our quick anniversary outting!!!! The 3 stars you see is for AJ and the food and because of them I didn't give you one star for great parking!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waldorf,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

It then took about 10 minutes before we saw our waitress with another waitress telling us our waitress would be with us shortly about 3 different times. Once our waitress showed up, there was no introduction, it was simply ""what do you want to drink."" We also gave her our entire order figuring who knows how long it would be till we saw her again. She delivered our drinks and disappeared before I realized she brought the wrong thing. We didn't see her again until our meal came out. She dropped the food and disappeared before we even realized that we didn't have silverware. We both got ribs that tasted like something you would expect from the freezer section at the grocery store. The mashed potatoes, I have had better instant powdered potatoes.

Had a long discussion with about four different people... at least two were managers... about why I was ordering just a burger and no sides. After they finally figured that out (I just ordered a burger with tomato and lettuce) we waited for about a half an hour before we got the order. There was cheese on it. It was cooked to well done. I walked out. I went to Five Guy's instead. Waited 6 minutes and had a perfectly done burger that did not betray my fructose intolerance.

One of my friends is pregnant and asked about a virgin daiquiri. While he said they do not have those on the menu, he personally went to see what he could do and came back with one for us.
