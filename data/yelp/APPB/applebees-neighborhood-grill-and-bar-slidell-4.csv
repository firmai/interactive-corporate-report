Nate H.,"Mandeville, LA",235,208,394,5.0,9/5/2017,I've always been a fan of Applebee's and was especially impressed with this one. I stopped in last weekend for a beer and appetizers. Seated a couple chairs down from me was a man who looked to be in his 80s. He wasn't in good health and had come in a wheelchair. He appeared to be a regular and I can see why. The employees went out of their way to take care of him and make sure he was having a good time. When he was ready to go the bartender wheeled his chair up to him and helped him get into it. She wheeled him up to the front door where I guess he was going to wait for his ride. She gave him a goodbye hug and a kiss on the cheek. Really nice. Talk about taking care of your customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Chantel S.,"San Antonio, TX",75,19,3,1.0,1/8/2018,"Came to this location for lunch last week; couldn't get service so I left. (It appeared they were short-staffed; the bartender was arguing with one of her customers about the bill as well). I waited for approximately 10 mins before deciding to have lunch elsewhere. Should have stayed away, but decided to give this location a second chance after all.  On tonight's visit, they were out of riblets (the current special) and also out of blue agave tequila (one of the happy hour specials). I ordered boneless wings. They looked great....I got to the 4th one and realized the meat was  bright pink; clearly partially cooked. Needless to say, my appetite was ruined. I also ordered loaded mashed potatoes which were warm at best. The cheese wouldn't even melt! When I ask for the bill, what do you know....the half cooked chicken was still on my bill. I had to ask for a manager to get my check adjusted.  That was my last time at Applebee's.  ***The one Star is for the designated Veteran Parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Allen M.,"Slidell, LA",22,13,9,5.0,10/4/2016,"Arrived late, around 8ish PM and was seated in a booth section.  Our server was Destini and she was excellent and very personable.   I ordered the salmon with honey mustard glaze over a bed of steamed spinach.   Destini said she could put the glaze sauce on the side because I had said I didn't like sweet stuff.  When the meal came I tried the sauce and it complimented the salmon exquisitely and had a smokey aftertaste. I am extremely satisfied with the meal and the service.  Destini was unobtrusive as we told her we cocktail first and order.  She is an excellent server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Kelly K.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,9,2,1.0,4/9/2017,"Worst service ever.  When we walked in, employees were just ""hanging out"".  We got seated, food took over an hour and they got the order wrong after clarifying twice.  Best part, no one was there!  Dont waste your time, We won't be back!  If I could post the photo I have of all the employees just laughing and carrying on in the back, while we waited patiently for over an hour.. I would!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Angela N.,"New Orleans, LA",36,2,,3.0,9/26/2015,"When in Slidell, we here at from time to time, and we usually get the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 entree deals that comes with either 2 side salad or 1 choice of appetizer.  We ordered two 7 oz. bourbon steaks, and when we tried it, it was super salty. Using A1 was making it worse, and ketchup was making it more manageable. We also ordered the chicken and shrimp, and 4-cheese mac and cheese w/ peppered chicken tenders, and they tasted delicious. Overall, the service was terrific, and they offered to give us another steak with no seasoning in replacement of the salty steaks.  I definitely recommend this place if you're one of those people who like tasty and simple dishes!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4

d l.,"Slidell, LA",0,25,7,1.0,4/8/2017,"Very bad experience! A month ago my wife and I walked in and the place was empty and the hostess said that it would be a five minute wait. Would we mind? The place was empty! We walked out and went to Outback across the parking lot and was seated instantly. This week I said I would give Applebee's another chance, and we waited 45 minutes for our food. Again not a busy time. The food was bland and not presented very well. A very small serving for the price. We will never go back. Sorry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Shannon M.,"Slidell, LA",90,53,29,1.0,11/14/2016,"Ok first off, I have never been a fan of Applebee's in general. Saints game and buzzed, we wound up here on a whim and laughed. We thought, why not? We wanted to like it so bad... trust me. Those late night alcohol buzz cravings really get to you. Let's just say our buzz ended pretty quickly. We ordered the sampler appetizer to give it a shot. We were not fully committed to ordering any entrees just yet.  Oh how this appetizer killed the vibe. Cheese sticks, still frozen. The spinach dip? Soupy and flavorless. (We really were looking forward to this one lol. By the way... isn't one of the main ingredients in this cream cheese? Let's just say there was a major LACK THERE OF) The boneless wings in honey BBQ sauce? Good god almighty. Nope. Not today not ever. Lastly, the quesadillas. Do you know the cans of chicken meat you can buy at your local Walmart or grocery? Yep, this is it but only worse. The chicken was a consistency I just could not put my finger on. We bit off each one of these apps and just couldn't. We sent it back. The bartender was sweet as ever and we felt terrible but seriously... Applebee's.. what the hell? Nope. No... never again to all applebees in the entire world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Pete F.,"Manhattan, NY",27,54,10,2.0,3/27/2016,"Applees is mediocure normally, but being in slidell this one is extra. Don't bother with so many other restaurants around. Plus the portions are really small for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Marcelino H.,"Chula Vista, CA",187,3,,5.0,11/11/2015,"First time being here and I should say the service is great.  The bartender (Rebecca)even though busy enough, she still have time to ask how the customers are doing.  And also thank you for all the support that you guys giving to all the veterans.  Hooyah!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Floyd D.,"Slidell, LA",0,19,1,2.0,3/5/2015,"Got there at 4:00 and ordered soup, Chicken sandwich and a Burger. The soup came out a minute which was good but wanted with the sandwich.  The Burger arrived first 25 minutes later than came the Chicken Sandwich couple of minutes later. Don't sound like a long time but we were one of the only people in there. The Chicken Sandwich was missing the applebacon on it. The Burger was cooked good and tastey, but the Red onions were so slimy I didn't dare put them on. The lettuce was old and on the last leg.  Waitress was nice but overall didn't like the dining experience.  Should have went to the Roadhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Brandy O.,"Westminster, SC",286,15,4,5.0,1/27/2015,The hosts was very pleasant in greeting me at the door when I first walked in. My server Eric was spot on he had my drink order in a timely manner.

Bobby S.,"Slidell, LA",0,6,5,1.0,8/18/2013,The manager Adam is an absolute a hole. Those poor people that work under him need to have a talk with higher ups. The way he treats the staff is deplorible. And no i dont or have ever worked there. Food not bad service is good. But after seeing that manager in action i will never go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4

Mary W.,"Hope Hull, AL",0,51,10,2.0,2/16/2014,Food was typical Applebee's / ok not greatE but good. They sat us next to a window that had a draft & acted like it was such an inconvenience to move us- it was about 40 degrees outside & the cold air coming in was quite miserable. They did move us across the isle & the temperature was much better. Restaurant was clean -again ok but nothing really great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Sabrina F.,"Slidell, LA",21,4,,2.0,4/24/2015,"Sorry for the bad review, but I ordered ceder salmon and portion was under sized and little flies have been swarming around my plate, not good Applebee's today.

Troy S.,"Richardson, TX",3,39,37,1.0,1/12/2014,"Had really bad experience with new management.  They refused to honor coupon after we called and were assured there would be no issues.  No customer service at this location,  left and ate at Texas Roadhouse, will not return til management changes again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
Jeremy T.,"Bryan, TX",5,28,,2.0,2/26/2015,"Eaten here many times over the years and overall experience is always the same. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, but the food is always hit or miss. Pasta plates seems to be their best and safest bets as most of the steaks, burgers, and ribs are extremely inconsistent ranging from overcooked to flat out burned. Every time I've eaten here and ordered a burger or steak I prayed it would be better than the last, however it never is. I only eat here now when I have to and always stick to pasta. Again, not bad, just better choices around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-slidell-4
