Tim A.,"Butler, NJ",3,8,,2.0,2/6/2012,"General: 4/10 Average with competent server: 6.5/10. General restaurant experience is based 90% on the competency of the server!  Request a good one! Food:  Good for price. 7/10 Generally food is well seasoned and extremely flavorful. Quality/Quantity: Below Average 4/10 Some entrees provide large portions but many of the extras are skimpy (i.e. French fry quantity).  Food is often cooked/prepared differntly depending on the time of day. (i.e. food prepared late at night or during high-volume hours is often of lower preparation quality than food prepared at other times. Too many mistakes on food!  Whether food is prepared correctly is 50/50 while there is also a high chance of burgers and steaks not being cooked to temperature Service:  Luck of the draw. 6/10 General restaurant experience is based 90% on the competency of the server!  Request a good one! Alcohol:  Below average. 4/10 Beer/wine servings are skimpy.  Margaritas often taste different depending on the bartender.  Salt is often mixed into the margarita.  Actual juice servings are only about 5 ounces because of ice-filled cups.  To-go service is slow. Host/hostess: No host??? This doesn't seem like the type of restaurant where you should sit yourself, should you?  Standing in the front of the restaurant is awkward and uncomfortable not to mention frustrating.  At Chilis of West Windsor the servers are responsible for seating guests but you can't blame them for making you wait because they are obviously very busy doing what they are supposed to be doing-waiting tables.  This is clearly a management/corporate issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-princeton
Tara S.,"Monroe Township, NJ",6,17,,2.0,4/17/2014,"We went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty empty, which is quite uncommon for a halfway decent restaurant on Route 1. Service was pretty poor. I had to go get my own napkins and we didn't get silverware until a few minutes after our food arrived. The manager delivered our food while our waitress stood with a friend and talked for twenty minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-princeton
Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1698,31,3.0,4/29/2011,"We came here for lunch, and although the service was slow, our waiter was very friendly and even waved goodbye to us as we walked out to the car.  He also checked on us frequently to make sure that everything was okay.  We split the ribs, quesadilla explosion salad, guacamole, and spinach and artichoke dip between the three of us.  The salad was pretty good, although there wasn't much lettuce in it.  The quesadillas were a nice touch but I kinda wished that they had more than just cheddar cheese as a filling.  The ribs were very tender and well-marinated; definitely a fan.  Fries wee well-seasoned and crispy.  The spinach dip was great: cheesy and flavorful.  The guacamole?  Well, let's just say that it was my least favorite.  Be warned that it is spicy.  Overall, a good value with decent food and great service.  It's also inexpensive if you get a lunch combo or the 2 for $20 dinners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-princeton
Anna S.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",81,4,,1.0,4/24/2014,"I used to like Chili's, I was a huge fan of their southwestern chicken wraps. This appetizer seems to shrink every time I order it. There is no more salad and diced tomatoes and wraps themselves came  barely warm. I ordered beef burritos, my daughter had cheeseburger from the kids menu. My burritos were  less than mediocre, the cheeseburger came flat and ugly. Service was ok, the girl was nice. The main thing that is the reason for only one star is the lack of cleanliness. The place is sticky and dirty. Silverware, tables, floors, plates. Everything needs a good, long scrub.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-princeton
