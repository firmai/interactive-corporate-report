The rest of the lukewarm burger was just mush.  McDonalds puts out a better burger, and for only $1.   My husband ate half of his French Dip and could not eat anymore, it had salt and grease everywhere.  And for 14 bucks I would want my sandwich to be bigger, I think it probably had about 3 oz of meat on it, and there was nothing PRIME about the meat, it had the consistency of frozen beef product.  The only flavors we tasted were salt and grease.  On a positive note they did not charge us for the grease and salt dip, and we have the knowledge to NEVER EVER eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=140,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.9480000000000004,2.68
108,Phil M.,"Portland, OR",40,179,,3.0,2012-05-25,"Much like Jules Winfield from ""Pulp Fiction"", I'm pretty much a vegetarian, but I do love the taste of a good burger. Unfortunately, their veggie burgers are standard fare (Gardenburger or Boca, not homemade), so I shied away and went with a full-fledged meat burger, the Prime Chophouse to be precise. It was pretty fantastic. The bottomless steak fries are a huge plus. The only cons I can think of are the priciness and the lack of decent veggie burger options. Heck, I'd be willing to put up with the priciness if they offer a fresh, homemade veggie burger option.

46,Julie E.,"Boise, ID",195,326,264.0,2.0,2012-09-06,"We stopped at this Red Robin after my brother picked me up at PDX.  We were on the road out to Astoria and needed some dinner.  The parking lot seems small, and it's tough to park a compact car when there are giant SUV's squeezed into the spots.  Also, having a door near the parking lot that makes you weave all through other diners to get to the front desk seems kind of ridiculous- but we shook that off and got seated.  My brother asked to split  a meal with his daughter as she is not a big eater.  He EXPLICITLY asked to use is Red Robin Rewards card for the APPETIZER special.  The other two girls and I ordered our burgers, and away went our server.  Things were a bit busy, so we didn't fuss about having a bit of a wait for our food.  The food was well prepared and enjoyable. But when my brother asked for a refill of fries for his daughter (whom he was sharing with) he was informed (and rather shortly) that it would be $1.99 for a refill since he was sharing with her. He said okay, but as she walked away both he and his daughter mentioned that when they'd been there before, both with and without my sister-in-law that they'd NEVER been charged for more fries when sharing with a child.  We waited in hopes that the manager would come by to check in with us so he could bring it up, but one never arrived. The wait for fries (both for my brother and his girl, and the other girls) was long.  When the server picked up a plate near me she slopped stuff off it onto the table, and barely even apologized (she stained a birthday card that I was waiting to hand my brother. We just generally felt like we weren't paid much attention too, and certainly that we did not get th service we usually see at Red Robin.  My brother meant to email the company, but wound up losing his receipt.  Our server got her tip, but it could have been a much bigger tip had she paid us a it more attention. Oh, and my brothers' rewards card was dinged for his FREE BURGER (which he was saving) rather than the APPETIZER SPECIAL that he asked for.

My husband and I eat at Red Robin regularly enough to say we have tried everything on the menu even, their seasonal burgers. We have been to several in the Portland area. I've even been to Red Robins from Florida to Washington State, so I feel as though I know their food well. I also know when their food changes. I ate at this location last week and order my usual Bonsai Burger, I have eaten this burger enough that my palate has memorized the flavor. This visit, the meat was completely different. It was not the typical REAL meaty patty, where they ask you how you want it cooked- it was a pressed, dry, over cooked, rubbery patty that left me with the same after taste as Burger King and McDonald's. It was less than half the normal size and the bread practically swallowed the patty. Typically we are stuffed after our burgers and fries, but we ALL left hungry experiencing the same odd after taste and dissatisfied with the over priced Burger King/McDonald's patty. I don't know if the big change has change owners, or the cost of beef has affected their quality, but this is the kiss of death for me. Paying nearly 11/12$ for a burger that is no better quality than fast food is frustrating and a rip off. I don't know if this change is for good, or just temporary. The fries were also half the order, I don't know if this is to cute down on waste or again a permanent change in quality. While I was dissatisfied with my food, the service was wonderful.

My boyfriend ordered chicken and riblets, but was given riblets and mac & cheese (and no fries). The waitress fixed the order and didn't charge us, but the food took a while and by the time he got his fries, he was no longer interested. But he said the cookie milkshake was delicious -- the best part of the meal. The portions seem very small for a restaurant (especially one that serves mainly comfort food), and it was definitely overpriced. My boyfriend was given two chicken strips and handful of riblets and a handful of fries - which really isn't enough for someone over six feet.

Well, just continue reading and you'll understand why I would give it only 1 star. After a long evening Christmas shopping, my sister and I decided to stop by Red Robin for a quick bite. Oh how I wish I just crossed the road and went to BWW instead.  While I was walking to the front door from the parking lot, peering in I saw that the dining room was half full. Good, we can get seated and get our food quick. Oh how wrong I was.  The hostess was standing in the front with a smug look on her face when I walked in. I told her it's going to be just the two of us. She looked behind her into the dining room and told us it's going to be a few minutes. A little confused, I just said okay and sat down. Maybe they were trying to figure out their server layout.  About 5 minutes later, the hostess got us and walked us to our seats. My sister and I sat at our seats for about 5 minutes and we already knew what we wanted to order. However, no one stopped by to say hi and they'll be back to get orders in a sec, nor did they get us water before they were off serving other people. We at in our seats for 30 minutes. 30 minutes. Of no one stopping to even say hi. We closed our menus and just sat there waiting for someone to come up and no one did. A bunch of other servers walked by and ignored our ""we're ready"" signal.  When our server FINALLY came by and said hi to us, he acted like us sitting there for 30 minutes was a normal occurrence. We made our orders and he walked away. The food came out about 20 minutes after that. Not only did he get my appetizer order wrong, he ordered the full size when I asked that I only wanted the appetizer size. When he delivered us our burgers, I asked if I can get some sauces on the side. He was gone for 20 minutes before he came back checking on us. I asked if he had our sauces he was startled because he forgot, came back with the wrong sauces and spent another 10 minutes to come back. He then topped off my water, but also topped off my sister's Sprite with water. Great. Thanks for ruining our meals AND our drinks.  I had to consistently remind him we wanted our checks and boxes so we can leave. Our planned hour dinner turned out to be an hour and half fiasco. Before when I worked off of Airport Way, my coworkers and I would always go to this Red Robin with no disappointment. I have no idea what happened. Maybe it was a bad night.

Obviously he wasn't joking.... I had him search the office again and he told me nothing turned up...................... Totally unreal and FUxxed UP!

Needless to say, my day was spent on canceling my credit cards and bank cards and filling out police report. I know the fault is mine for leaving my wallet there..... And if the waitress told me that she had never seen it... Then I would feel like and idiot and not write this here..... But when the waitress confirmed that she picked it up (actually she told me that she had the bus boy pick it up and bring it to the GM and GM confirmed that he received it from him) and all of a sudden it vanished into the thin air.......  I am so disappointed in the way this management handled this case as they weren't even that apologetic...... Shame on you and what a pathetic customer service mind you have. Red Robin HQ really should consider investigating this location and train their staff....

74,Jason A.,"Portland, OR",57,257,16.0,4.0,2015-09-24,"Stellar location! Normally with a chain restaurant I pick the one closest to me that I usually go to.  I've written a few for the Clackamas location, but this one deserves its own review. Met some friends here for dinner and drinks and we really had a nice time.  Great service, highly attentive and always smiling.  This was the first time in the last six visits to a Red Robin that they got my order right, the food was hot, and we all enjoyed everything.  Super clean location too, including the restrooms which is important to me. It's a very busy location here, near the airport and airport hotels.  Not a lot of eating choices, so flyers know a go-to spot like a Red Robin.  Plus, they bring in the Vancouver crowd that doesn't mind a quick trip over the bridge to save some tax cash.  Overall I was really impressed with the efficiency, speed, and attentiveness of everything.  While I cannot speak for all the locations, this one is far superior to the ones I've been to.  Obviously they've made great strides in hiring good people here, and managers have taken 'process flow' to heart. Negatives?  A few minor things.  As I said they do get busy, and there are times when waiting will be an issue so be prepared or send a friend over early to grab a table like we did.  Also, I am not a fan at all of the new trend in chain restaurants to have the table side electronic order computer.  You can use it to order appetizers, drinks, and you are forced to use it when paying by debit/credit card.  This is where they lose a star from this reviewer.  I find it disrespectful to me as a customer.  There's a reason I'm tipping the wait staff..........for service.  I realize these new computers at the table save money for the company and end up with add-on sales($1.99 to play games), but it's really silly and I don't think it's very nice at all.  However, this did not distract from my experience with my server or my meal to be fair. Overall, great Red Robin, and I wouldn't hesitate to return and suggest it to others.  We were left literally saying, ""Man, that's a good burger"".  A winner in my book!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.6719999999999997,2.6

The food is always good and with a very few exceptions the service is at least good.  This particular location provided my family with one of the few exceptions. We came in on a Monday evening around 7pm. The place was probably three-quarters full and didn't seem ""busy"". I've worked as a cook, as a server and as a bartender. This was a so-so Monday night for a chain restaurant in this location. We were greeted immediately and seated in the back. We then waited 15 minutes to be seen by a server and have our drink orders taken. Because we had the time, while waiting, we were ready to order our whole meal at that point. So we did.  15 minutes later, drinks arrive.  20 minutes later our server tells us that our order ""never made it to the kitchen""... and asked us to order again. Which we did.  We've already been here longer than we expected without food and a hungry 3 year old. 20 minutes later our re-ordered food arrived and all was well until it was time to pay the check.  Our check arrives and we're told to use the pay station at the table. Except we can't because our check is wrong (double charged for a couple of items). So, we need a manager, so we wait... ultimately our check is corrected to exactly what was ordered. No offer of discount for inconvenience, no apology. Just a ""here ya go, thanks for coming in"".

My sister in-law raves about it, but wow! I do like the burger with the fried egg on it, and my husband's favorite seems to be the A.1 burger.  I've learned what is good and what is bad enough to tolerate it when I'm dragged here with the family. Would I return on my own? Hell no. It's a chain restaurant in Portland.

It was national pretzel day, so we decided to order the pretzel bites with beer cheese as an appetizer. When they came out, they weren't really that warm and the middles were still frozen. When we brought it up to the waitress (I didn't catch her name), she was extremely polite and immediately took ours back and brought us an entirely new plate. These ones were almost overcooked, really really crunchy, but they still tasted good, and hey, they weren't cold. I got the guac and bacon burger. I don't remember what my boyfriend got, but I think it was something with BBQ sauce on it. My burger was delicious, and I subbed the steak fries for sweet potato fries and those were great too. My boyfriend also enjoyed his food. He says the garlic aioli was phenomenal.  However, when we ordered, we were very clear that I wanted ranch for my fries and he wanted the garlic aioli. When our food arrived, I had some black peppercorn sauce, and he had my ranch. We pointed this out, and once again the server was extremely polite about it, and brought him his aioli and me another ranch, just in case I didn't want to use the one on his plate. Due to the nature of the mistakes, I'm assuming something was going on back in the kitchen, but it was 8:45 on a Thursday night and they weren't super busy at all, so I'm not sure what the problem was. Finally, when we went to pay, there was a $2 entertainment fee that had been charged to our table, buy we hadn't played any games or anything on the tablet. We had to call the server over and have her override the payment so we could actually pay our bill. She said the previous patrons must have played games, put it on a second tab, and then left without paying for it. Overall: the food was tasty and the server was super polite and nice about the few mix up and mistakes that happened.

But what can we say .. my mistake .. not on 'em. The second mistake however was to order the BOCA patty (vegetarian person not vegan .. should have taken the garden burger) .. and I am sorry but our first ever experience with the BOCA patty wasnt a good one, somehow tasted like cardboard :( .. The good part were the sweet potato fries that we asked as sides.
