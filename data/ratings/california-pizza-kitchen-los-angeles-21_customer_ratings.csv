We sat down and I ordered a virgin citrus crusher, which was brought to me pretty quickly. We each ordered a pizza.  Owen and I somehow managed to order the Sicilian, which I told him that he should've ordered something different since he could have half of mine.  Joshua ordered the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza, I think... The food came out about 10-15 minutes later.  My pizza was actually better than I expected, thank goodness Owen ordered his own because Joshua took a slice of mine already.  Joshua seemed to enjoy his pizza as well. My only complaint is that my drink was terrible.  I understand that it's a virgin, but I didn't ask for watered down lemonade w/orange juice.  It was $7 for goodness sakes.  At least, make it drinkable.  I could've asked for a glass of ice water, a few slices of lemon and orange with a few crushed mint leaves and make my own for free.  Sheesh!

I asked for a coke she gave me diet and when I asked for a regular she didn't apologize she got sassy and said oh is this a diet? As if I was lying. 15 minutes we got our pizza... she didn't bother to bring us plates for the first ten minutes so we had to use our napkins and then we had to ask another server for plates because our server was to busy to bring them to us.

We ordered food and sat down with our beers. Then checked our phones ... omg the flight was landing way early!! Alex was so sweet- he put our beers in the fridge and kept our food warm and ordered more- 30 minutes we came back when they were closing and they gave us the sweetest service, warm food- we settled up but they gave us no push to go. It was just so genuinely nice. The cheese and pepperoni pizzas were good. Massively overpriced!!! The mushroom pizza was dry and lacked sauce and cheese. I would not reorder. The shrimp were good but probably 2000 calories. Limited beer selection. Prices are obscene. Food was adequate.

I'm going to sit at the bar even if I don't feel like a drink.  I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink and I told her ice water- the vibe was obvious that she was annoyed. Sorry, don't feel like drinking , just hungry. I'd be at home eating somewhere else or at a normal CPK with normal prices if my flight didn't get delayed two hours. But, it is what it is. Don't throw the straw at me as you put my water down. I was so turned off that I told her I'd like my pizza togo. She told a guest next to me to move his bag cus there are plenty of people wanting to sit which is fine, if it didn't sound like she was scolding him. This is true however, it's obvious your trying to turn and burn your seats so you get quantity instead of quality tips. So within that hour of you pushing guests out, giving checks to some that weren't ready to check out, and pretty much flat out ignored me until you saw me staring at you and then my pizza that was getting cold in the window- you probably made 30 bucks? But I bet if you'd smile and slow down a second - not making it obvious that customers that don't drink or don't order enough are a nuisance to you - you could've made more. I'm a good tipper and when I say this, I say it proudly cus I've done the service industry before- I know how customers can be and blah blah.

This gives me the chance to just hangout a bit before getting on a plane.  Not a fan of Rock and Brews (aka I hate that plac - see reviews if curious enough) and I've tried Reilly's (it was okay) so next in line was CPK.  I told the host I didn't need to be seated at a table and that I was more interested in sitting at the bar. She welcomed me in and confirmed open seating in that area.  Can't go wrong with beer (it was the weekend, after all) and something else to munch on. I saw all of their listed apps come out of the kitchen and they all looked really good. But, eh, I wanted to keep it simple, so I went for the guac+chips, which, by the way, looked mighty interesting - it had a lot of fillers per its description.  Now, I'm not really a fan of corn or cilantro, and yes, I am aware that both were included. I didn't really want to knock it until I tried it. Bowl got delivered and first thing I noticed was the whole thing was bombarded with corn. There was nothing ""guac"" about its appearance, for real.  But! I did ask for it, so I had to have at least a taste.  It was surprisingly very guacamole-y! The flavor of the avocado overpowered everything else on that bowl - including the taste of corn and cilantro. The crisp of the apple was a nice touch. I'll admit - I liked it.

We waited a few min in line to place a quick to-go order at the register.  We ordered two soups and a pizza. They have the pizzas ready to go in a heated area, so we got that right away but the soups, which we thought would have taken two seconds took 15 - 20 MINUTES TO GET. Our cashier said she would be right back with our soups, she then came back to tell us that she had to call a manager because the soup was too hot for her to pour.  5 min later ... no manager. She spots him walking around and starts to scream his name loudly over and over. He sees her and then walks around to the back. We thought he was going to get us our soup, but we never saw him again. She then tells us she had to call another manager and then begins to badmouth them all calling them stupid and how it takes 3 people to do a simple task here. I can't stand when employees bad mouth other coworkers to customers. It just irks me, and shows what kind of person you are. You all work there, you're all in it together, you all represent the company so help fix it.  While were standing off to the side, she proceeds to ring up other people, which she has to do to keep the line flowing, but then it became very easy for her to forget we were waiting. Another 5 min later, I see a different manager in the kitchen now screaming her name and she shouts back at him to pour the soups!! It took this dude another 5 min to do that and then walks them over to the register and places them by her on the counter. They were unreachable to us, and she was helping another customer so we had to wait for her to be done with that person. She then leaves to get that persons order and leaves our soup there. Why didn't the manager say ""Who was waiting for soup?"" And hand them to us? No he was just as careless and incompetent. At this point I was livid. My friend squeezes through the line and reaches over the counter to grab our soups which were poured in coffee cups and lids. Not very appealing.
