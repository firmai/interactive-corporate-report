144,Sui B.,"Jersey City, NJ",161,766,1235.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"I LOVE cheese cake factory! While other moms may take their children to Mickey Ds for a treat, my mom loved to take me to the cheesecake factory growing up. We always got the same thing, shrimp angel hair pasta, and because it comes in a huge portion, we would split it, but not before indulging in the warm fluffy bread they serve before the meal comes!  After walking back and forth in the short hills mall, we headed over here for some dinner and loved everything. My only complaint is the fish tacos which were not that great. Our waitress was efficient and nice! I would definitely be coming back here the next time I decide to go window shopping in this 5th avenue mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=100,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
207,Vanessa T.,"Honolulu, HI",155,444,14.0,1.0,2012-01-09,"Let me start off by saying that I love Cheesecake Factory food. Their Pasta da Vinci and salads are what keep me coming back. Cheesecake Factory is like BJ's/TGIF/Applebee's - a place you avoid like the plague unless your friend is throwing their birthday dinner there. Why? Because you'll wait forever for a table, then wait forever for your waiter, wait for your food and so forth. Dining becomes a long drawn out experience peppered with frustration, self-questioning and muttered threats of going home and Yelping. I understand that these types of places are almost always busy and Sunday lunchtime is no exception. However our bread basket arrived 20+ minutes after our waitress asked us if we'd like some and by a completely different waiter. The bf's soda had to wait 30 minutes to get refilled (also by a different waiter). Are you serious? Where did our server disappear to? I was not offered fresh parmesan for my pasta and um hello.. my middle name is ""More Cheese Please!"" Food is always consistent and service is consistently lacking.

I think this Cheesecake Factory location will be very successful, as the Short Hills Mall was slightly in need of another dining spot.  I think the food is great, but the service seemed to need improvement.  Hopefully over time, this will get better.  I think I will stick to the Menlo Park location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=160,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

While this location is aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately, it misses the mark where it counts - the food.  I know one shouldn't expect too much from large chains - but the drinks were just okay and overly priced and the food wasn't the quality I've had in their DC/VA locations (to the point that we cancelled one of our entrees).

116,Scott S.,"Union, NJ",3,23,,2.0,2012-06-04,"All Hope Abandon, Ye Who Enter Here... We found ourselves at this Cheesecake Factory on a recent Sunday afternoon, at the suggestion of some friends who desperately wanted to share with us the fatty, poor quality food and poor service for which this restaurant excels. As others have pointed out, this place is always packed and the customer is the one that suffers. We were seated promptly, for which I give the hostess credit, but then it felt like forever before a) we could order b) we got our drinks c) we got our meals. It must have been an hour between the initial hello from our waiter (who, strangely was handling tables on two sides of the restaurant!) to actually being able to eat anything.  And what a disappointment when the food finally did arrive. Look, I know it's chain food and I shouldn't have expected much. I figured I'd play it safe with a salad, and it was a good choice - except the salad was the size of a large mixing bowl. That's not healthy.  One of our friends mistakenly ordered the chicken and biscuits, and it was the single most disgusting plate I've ever seen. Frozen chicken breast swallowed-up by mountains of mashed potatoes and soggy, rubbery biscuits. Ick! Somehow, we accomplished to leave a little room for dessert. Each ordered a different cheesecake, hoping to share a bite or two. Lo and behold, only two arrived. It took a good 10 minutes to flag down our waiter to inform him the food had gone missing. He apologized profusely, and was very apologetic about it, but it took another 10 minutes before another server brought over the missing items. How can that happen? All they needed to do was cut two slices of cake and bring them to our table. It's a 30-second process. And the name of the restaurant would make you think they have the whole ""serving cheesecake"" thing down to a science. Of course, in the interim, the manager came by to offer a half-hearted ""so sorry, we're really busy"" apology and walk away before we could say anything. That was perhaps the most disconcerting part. Rather than make things right, he went through the motions and left before knowing the situation had been remedied. Bad, bad customer service. In all honestly, the cheesecake really wasn't very good. It was obvious it had been made someplace else, put on ice for days, and stored in a very cold refrigerator to prevent spoilage. This wasn't the kind of cheesecake you can get at Junior's or any number of places in the NY area famous for that dessert.  And if you can't get your signature item right, well, you know where this is going... By the time we left, a simple afternoon meal had turned into a two hour ordeal. It may not be hell, but it certainly was not a pleasant experience. There's a very good diner just around the corner. You'd be better served going there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=180,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

98,Jon L.,"Jersey City, NJ",85,70,71.0,4.0,2012-09-09,"As Atul Gawande opined in a recent New Yorker, the Cheesecake Factory is, above all else, consistent in what it offers - a family-friendly dining experience with huge portions (it's no wonder that professional athletes cite tCF as their restaurant of choice on the road). No, it's not Michelin star-worthy, but the food much better and more varied  than your run-of-the-mill family restaurant chains.  Why this place gets at least four stars: -If I were to rate the chain as a whole, I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars, so it starts at a high baseline. I can't think of any other restaurant that has a menu as big as this one and manages to pull off even 2/3 of the dishes passably well. Notice, I said passably well, not great. But, when you have leftovers for another meal (or two), you shouldn't judge too harshly. Why this place gets no more than four stars: -This particular location is smaller than others I've been to, so sometimes the wait can be long.  -Another infrastructural issue - the restrooms are smaller than usual - both in terms of space inside and the number of stalls. Maybe the designers figured the smaller seating capacity makes it a moot point, but did they anticipate having an additional list of patrons waiting 30-45 minutes?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=140,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.9920000000000004,2.44

Why? I couldn't tell you, except they were obsessed. On their last night here, we went to the Cheesecake Factory.  After we were seated the waitress, not so nicely introduced herself, following it up with telling us that the restaurant closed at 10 - it was 8:30. While I thought it was a little unprofessional and rude, I ignored it.  We were waiting for the forth member of our party - which we had told both the hostess as we were seated and the waitress when she came for our drinks orders. She seemed very annoyed that she had to wait, and disappeared... not to the point of we could not see her, she walked past us plenty of times, but she ignored us until SHE was ready.  While she did seem very familiar with the menu, she did not seem to want to answer any questions. Thankfully a different server delivered our food. Of course, as it's the Cheesecake Factory, my Canadian friends want cheescake (I had tried to take them to Juniors, but they weren't interested). My Canadians friends and my boyfriend all ordered cheesecake, but as the only New Yorker in the world who doesn't like Cheesecake, I ordered the Apple Crisp. Well, as the waitress had not written down away of the desserts we ordered, she brought me the Apple Strudel cheesecake. When we mentioned it was the wrong item, she took the dish back, but not before we heard her say ""Bitch.""  My Canadian friends were very upset and had the manager come over - who was very understanding. However, I don't think a server should have that kind of attitude - at least not in the dining room.

Huh? We waited for the drinks. We waited for the food. We waited for the check. We waited and waited and waited.  2) French country salad with approximately one beet, one asparagus and one tiny piece of cheese. Where was the erst? Maybe it didn't fit on the tray... 3) My 3 year old wanted Mac N cheese from the kids menu. When it arrived the top was kind of congealed. I tested it for heat, and it was luke warm, so my son proceeded to eat, but he ate from the middle and SCREAMED from burning his tongue. Seriously - Microwaved Mac N Cheese for kids? What the... We called the manger over who proceeded to explain in a derogatory manner that when cooking mac N Cheese they boil the pasta and cheese. No shit, of course they do.

Boil it all you want (or in this case microwave it since it was hot in the middle and cold on the outside) but make sure it is safe fro children before you serve it. The manager kept protesting and really didn't get it. He offered a free dessert. Really, we should have made a huge scene, but we were frankly to shocked. Again, the manger didn't understand what was wrong with serving piping hot, microwaved food to small children. He should NOT be working in the food industry and he is lucky our son wasn't seriously hurt. But he now refuses to eat Mac N Cheese, or pasta, he was so scared from the experience. 4) After this seriously disappointing meal we headed to the bathroom. The ladies room smelled of urine and had paper towels on the floor like any old fast food place. Is this supposed to be a Cheesecake Factory?  Really? Disgusting.  If I were at Cheesecake Factory HQ I would fire the manger and most of the staff and start over and I would teach those supposedly professional restaurant people how to serve kids food before someone gets hurt.

I asked to see the manager who showed up at the table with a bad attitude and had the audacity to say she saw my pizza sitting in the window and didn't know why it was never delivered.   The server then arrived with my salad and pizza at the same time.  It was obvious that both had been sitting back there for a while.  When I declined to accept, the manager asked me if there was anything else she could do.  She never really apologized and when asked for a comment card, she simply replied they do not have any and that I would have to go online to submit my comments. Thanks to them, I didn't get the opportunity to eat and ended up grabbing a quick bite at one of the service plazas on the Turnpike.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory for being so horrible this time.  I have taken clients there before but will give serious consideration to taking them there again.

We ordered the cheeseburger sliders for our child and kale salad & Vietnamese style fresh rolls for me and my husband got the Chicken & Biscuits. When my child's order arrived, my husband took a test bite and found a looong red hair embedded in his bite. We informed the waitress, who without a word brought back the offending plate to the kitchen and several minutes later brought a freshly cooked order of new sliders that were delicious AND hair-free. My salad and rolls were as good and fresh as always, and Hubby's chicken and biscuits were fantastic. When we got our bill, we saw the child's slider order was removed, which was completely the appropriate thing to do, and we added the amount towards the waitress's tip.

I had even asked one of the staff members for the water and had nastily been told to wait on line. I'm not asking for cheesecake just water... Calm down.   When we finally got to our table the utensils were dirty wth? Our server was a nice girl but her head really wasn't in it! First she forgot the wine we ordered and it took 3 times back to the kitchen to get my meal right.

It wasn't anything weirdly complicated either, just laziness. Beyond that the food was bland and really not worth the  80 bucks they squeezed out of us.  Not going back. Oh.. Also...

Totally ignored by the waitress who I guess forgot we asked for it.  While eating my order of Imperial Chicken and Shrimp I was totally grossed out.   I found a hair in the sauce. As gross as it sounds, I think i ate part of the hair as I had been slicing my food in the same area I found the hair within the sauce. We notified the waitress who said I'm sorry about that.  She took the plate away.  A few minutes later came back by the table and asked if I wanted another plate made.  Promptly the assistant manager stopped by the table.  She advised me she checked the kitchen and ensured that all employees were wearing the appropriate head coverings.  That response did nothing but make me feel as though I was responsible for the hair in the plate.   FYI: I am bald lol - so yea ok. After this, the waitress continued to be dismissive and uninterested in treating us like we were her customers. She never asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu (Isn't this the Cheesecake Factory?). Dropped off the check and blurted out, ""We took both orders off of the bill"".

As a consumer, I do not tolerate mediocre service and disrespect from ANY establishment and whenever I'm displeased, there should be some type of resolve that benefits both parties involved. My wife and I dined here last evening. Our food was amazingly good however, I was displeased with the drinks ordered. First, I ordered a Mojito.

Well, the Cosmo arrived and tasted just as crappy as the last disappointment. So, again, I told him that this wasn't acceptable and could he just bring red wine instead.  This dude decides to bring the manager on call instead. She politely came over to tell me that they're not taking the second drink off the tab. I replied: ""Well...I'm dissatisfied with your drink service. I ordered red wine as the absolute last resort and I doubt I'll send it back - as it is wine. I mean, you can't really screw up wine.""

I knew it had been a long time when I discovered that they had a cocktail menu. Last time I came here, I didn't even know what a cocktail was.

There is a ton to choose from, and plenty of decadent sounding lunch specials. Oh also, their hot sourdough bread and butter is the stuff that dreams are made of.  4 Stars- The Mojito. It had fresh muddled mint and blueberry. It was divine.  3 Stars- The overall dining experience. Read on and you'll see why... 2 Stars- The service was waaaack. No one asked how we were doing and it took like 30 minutes to bring us our check...after we asked 10 times.  1 Star- The food.

Instead of 2 or 3 neatly presented sliders, it was a platter of haphazardly assembled greasy chicken patties and mushy buns with a mess of lettuce and tomato on the side.

164,Ross G.,"New Providence, NJ",0,14,,1.0,2015-11-27,"I wrote a fairly negative review when this CCF opened up in 2011.  However, we hung in and so did they.  Service got better and we probably averaged two visits a week since then. We generally time our visits in the late afternoon on weekdays to avoid waiting and, while spotty, overall it was good enough to keep us coming. That said, we have seen a considerable deterioration of both service and food quality over the last six months.  While there are some great waiters and waitresses, there is a lot of standing around and talking to each other when the restaurant is not busy and seeming overwhelmed when it is.  Either way, no one checks and refills drinks or comes around to see if everything is OK.  People walk around but still ignore customers. We put up with this because we loved the food, but almost every time we have visited this restaurant over the last two months something has been wrong with one of our meals (cold fries, cold mashed potatoes, mayonnaise when we asked for dry, etc..) such that one of us ate while the other waited for the correct food.  One visit, it took so long to get the correct meal that I ate dessert with my wife and took home my main course when it finally arrived.  We have also noticed great variation in portion sizes, things generally getting smaller then occasionally huge again.  Cake is most noticeable in the variation.  It also takes a long time to get food, even when the restaurant isn't busy. The last straw was Wednesday.  We were seated immediately.  The waitress was friendly but overwhelmed.  My wife's fries came out cold. And my meat loaf came with a few drips of gravy.  My wife got her new fries.  I asked for more gravy.  We did not see our waitress again for 10 or 15 minutes.  I never got gravy.  We had to eventually stop another waitress to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  We were so frustrated by the end of the night that even my wife, who cannot get enough of CCF agreed we were going back to other restaurants. Noticed lots of managers in the store CCF must know,they have a problem.  Doesn't seem to be working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=120,2.24,2.92,2.92,2.372,2.648

Then we got our table  and I ordered the Almond crusted salmon and kale salad and the reason I ordered this salad was because it had a lot of things in it that I like such as avocado, brussels sprouts and kale. when the salad came out it was just a big pile of kale with some arugula and a piece of salmon on it so I asked the server what happened to all the other things that are listed in it so she brought it back to the kitchen and 20 minutes later brought out that same salad with more kale and some pieces of avocado on it so I just gave up and ate it but they really didn't seem to have any kind of quality assurance nor did they seem to care.  Tables to the left and tight of us were also having isses and sending things back.  the couple next to us had such problems with their food they sent it back and then one had their food 1 didn't for at least 45 minutes.  The person with the food tried to wait for the other person to get their food which I'm sure the first person's food was cold by the time the second person's food came out 45 minutes later and when it did come back they rejected it and sent it back again.  All this time the waitress never came to check on them.. and then they ended up dining and dashing and suddenly  the waitress appeared and took off running after them!  another person next to us left their whole meal on their plate, no one seemed concerned to ask if something was wrong with it.  it seems like this place is really badly run and worse yet, no one seems to care...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=100,2.68,2.87,2.87,2.18,2.7940000000000005

I had to wait over 2 hrs to get a table for 12 which is completely unacceptable. Then I had one of the managers tell me at least 15 times that the table is almost done and they will be leaving soon. After about 10 mins arguing with him I insist he walk over to the table and see what's really going on. Told me the table was empty (no food, no drinks) and they had already paid their bill and they were basically talking the night away. Common courtesy, when the restaurant is busy and your done eating drinking and you paid your bill, please leave and don't waste time. Once that was settled, he sends over the busser to wipe down the tables and reset them. Once that was done, we were directed to the back of the restaurant in a private and enclosed area away from everyone. First thing I notice before I sat down was the utensils plates and napkins were not properly placed on the tables, they were scattered everywhere. Our server then comes over and introduces himself to us. Order our drinks and brings over 2 baskets of bread for a table of 12. Since we didn't order appetizers we munched on atleast 5 baskets of bread before we ordered our entrees. 15-20 mins later it's already 10:45pm when our food comes to us and we basically didn't enjoy the meal as we hoped we would. I barely ate my food that I had to pack it to go because of how late it got. The staff then came over and sang happy birthday to me which was a nice touch to ending the night. I would give this place a 1 star but I gave it a two just to be nice.

I've been to several locations over the years, and only today I realized that I've never had a bad meal there. Two of my usuals are the Thai Lettuce Wraps (when I want something a little lighter) and the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas (those corn cakes on the side are ah-mazing). Today my boss treated the staff to lunch for Admin. Professional's Day, and everyone loved their meals. We shared several appetizers: Avocado Egg Rolls (always a favorite; these are ridiculously good), Buffalo Blasts (really good; the portion is huge), the Crab & Artichoke Dip (okay but not great; the flavor was a little lacking), and the Fried Mac n Cheese Balls (I mean it's fried mac n cheese. what's not to love?) For my meal, I had the fish tacos with the tempura style fish. I've had plenty of fish tacos in my day, and these are pretty exceptional. The cabbage slaw takes it over the top with the right amount of acidity and crunch. The rice and beans on the side were better than average as well. I ordered my cheesecake to go because I was beyond stuffed at this point. I had the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, and I'd definitely recommend it (as long as you're not one of those if it's not chocolate it's not dessert kind of people). It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, and the ladyfingers added an extra textural element which I thoroughly enjoyed.

33,Bevin M.,"Cranford, NJ",71,30,3.0,1.0,2016-07-02,"What started out as a nice family outing with my boyfriends family went bad really quickly!! We met the family at the restaurant from shopping in the mall. When we sat the rest of them had already gotten drinks. It's started with our waiter not asking for our drink options. I asked for a glass of wine. Then he left for about ten minutes and came back with water. I asked about my wine. 5 minutes later he came back but no wine. We said can we order ""please let us"". We all ordered and he finally brought my wine after.  Two people had to leave so it was 4 remaining. Another 30 minutes came and our entrees still had not come out. But we ate more and more bread. Finally, the food started to come. 2 plates, 4 minutes later another plate, finally 5 minutes later the last plates came and we asked one to be wrapped for the person who had to leave. It was time to eat. Well I got garlic pasta with shrimp. this was supposed to have asparagus, but no asparagus. So then I asked for asparagus from another waiter.  Then our actual waiter actually came back. I felt the pasta and it was cold, not a little warm , fully cold, so he took the pasta back. Then the missing asparagus came. I thought ok I can eat that. It was cold, refrigerator cold, and I was like I'm done. I grabbed the waiter and said to just cancel. It was enough incompetence for a night. When I asked the waiter to feel the asparagus he was embarrassed. He then walked away after I told him to cancel. He came back 10 minutes later and asked if the manager had come yet. She did not. Her name is Susan Luca. She did not come. Then the waiter asked if we wanted anything. I said yes, just get me wine. 10 minutes later it came.  Now if you are already mad, that sucks. The waiter came back again, We said we want menus to see about possible deserts, he left to get them. 10 minutes passed, and in that time I got a menu from the waiter station in front of our table. Then more time passed so we asked another waitress to get the manager.  She said ok and came right back and said Susan was with another table. So we asked her to get our check. Once we got it, guess what was still on it? My cold food I sent back and the glass of wine I wanted in its place. Now maybe not the wine, but as pissed as we were, take off the item we sent back. Nothing was offered to make up for it. So we waited longer.  The waiter came back ten minutes later with menus. We said we were done and why did it take him so long to get menus. We said forget desert we need the manager to take off the meal. He said under his breath, ""she didn't remove it yet"". I actually felt bad for this kid.  It was possibly the worst service & management I have seen. We asked asked for the manager Susan who never came before to come.  Then finally after everyone was boiling and no manager and no real check, we did the math and took the dish off ourselves and left cash. As we were walking out, the manager Susan finally graced us with her incompetent presence. She's the worst! Came over slowly, no hustle. At this point there was nothing to say. We already took the food off, we all wanted to leave and I was starving. I told her to take the check and we already took the dish off ourselves. That this place sucks and we will never return. She then turned to the waiter and said ""some people don't know how to talk to others"". Well you are right lady! After waiting over 40 minutes for you to come over and not eating, I don't want to talk to you. After meeting this woman, I don't blame the kitchen or the waiter I blame her. She runs the restaurant while managing and clearly doesn't know what she is doing. I have managed, waited and bartended at many places and I have never seen a more incompetent lazy manager in my life.

Granted, I'm still sitting, waiting for the check, but I haven't had to wait too long for anything (my bf and I took awhile to figure out what we wanted). Buffalo blasts came out incredibly salty. Not only was the chicken and cheese filling seasoned (not complaining! It was great!) but the flour was heavily salted; adding the Buffalo sauce and blue cheese became very hard to do with all the existing salt.  Then we get our main courses: shrimp and sausage pasta, and the Cajun jambalaya pasta with shrimp. The shrimp and sausage pasta dishes was out of this world good! Pasta was a tad bit too al dente for the bf, but it was spot on for me. The Cajun jambalaya, on the other hand, was severely overcooked, had NO sauce/taste, and absolutely not to my recollection, not even close. But I was so hungry, I ate a bunch of it, while waiting for the waiter to pass by. He ended up coming back with extra sauce from the manager of the kitchen and it was everything the dish was missing. My poor waiter, Joseph, was so apologetic when it wasn't even his fault I felt bad.... I would give this review 5 stars just for Joseph, if I could, but unfortunately the food was sorely substandard. Consistency across meals and dishes in regards to salt and degree of spice is so lacking here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=80,2.56,2.68,2.68,2.6640000000000006,2.632

19,Billy V.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",580,505,656.0,5.0,2017-02-13,"The Cheesecake Factory a national chain with restaurants in higher end malls or locations. Let me state that I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant ever. Two weeks ago, I was just blown away on my first visit. It was a WOW visit. From the moment I walked in, I was just impressed with ambiance, service and food. What more can I say. It was just awesome. I was at the Short Hills Mall waiting for the wife who works just across the street. I happen to enter another restaurant a few hundred feet away and just had a horrible experience. Everything that drives me crazy about service in a restaurant; they did. Moving forward, as I walked in at the CF music was at right level. Perfect lighting. Everyone just busy doing their jobs, without looking like they where running around ""like a chicken without their head"". Everything seem perfect and working right. Found a seat at the bar and let me say it was busy. Bar area was packed with Happy Hour customers. Ordered a Mojito; delicious. Good. Damn good. It was as perfect a mojito as I ever had. That mixture of tartness and sweetness with the aromatic mint, made for a wonderful delight. Best part $5.95 for this delicious drink. Remember HH pricing. Now I am a burger guy and when I see sliders I just order. It is the perfect food when enjoying adult beverages. The order consisted of 4 sliders that were moist and tasty. It was a real deal at $5.95 Happy Hour Special. Service was just outstanding. Period. The young lady was personable, friendly and made a mean drink. Life is good. At 6:08 or so I asked if I can order apps. The Bartender said, let me check if they changed over from HH menu to regular menu and made it happen. No hassle. No drama. She just offer me the HH menu for food with no worries. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory will be my Happy Hour place when in the area. With outstanding service, food and cocktails this customer is a very happy camper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills,2.52,2.69,2.69,2.9320000000000004,2.622

I always come here to celebrate special events because the menu is so large that there really is something for everyone. I haven't had a single dish that I dislike. I especially like the roll sampler for appetizer and the chicken bellagio. Their herb crusted salmon filet is also very tender (can you describe fish as tender?) and flavorful.

61,Brittany Z.,"New York, NY",0,2,,2.0,2017-04-17,"I love cheesecake factory and  come to this location two to three times a month. The past few times I've come to this location I have not had the best experience. My last three visits consisted of having a piece of hair in my veggie burger, not having enough veggie burgers so I was served a ""mini"" veggie burger and charged for a skinny one in which the size did not compare, and then being told there were no more veggie burgers. Besides complaining about a veggie burger shortage, the cheesecake factory took off the veggie melt from their menu making my options slim to none. Another overall complaint, it's nearly impossible to get water refills. I prefer sitting near the bar because I can get up myself and get water when I need it instead of waiting until the next time my server drops something at the table.  My last visit started off bad as the host never set off my buzzer, so my 20 minute wait time turned into an hour, followed by staff not wanting to seat me in an area where I could elevate my broken leg when the restaurant was empty because it was 9PM on a weekday night. On top of being out of veggie burgers and not having a veggie melt on the menu, I settled for eggplant parm. I would never recommend this dish to an eggplant parm lover because you would be disappointed.

125,Daph E.,"Irvington, NJ",1,12,8.0,3.0,2017-05-06,"So let me preface this by saying don't go to a Cheesecake Restaurant and try to order steak. I made the mistake so you don't have to. Now if you read this and decide to order a steak after I told you not to, that's on you.  My girlfriends and I arrived on Friday, a little after 6:00 and were told there was a 10-15 minute wait. We didn't have any issue with that because we hadn't seen each other for a bit and we 3 are gifted with the gift of gab! We didn't wait 10 minutes which was great.  On to my dinner, which left me underwhelmed. So I ordered the Hibachi Steak because I let my anemia choose the entreé. It was supposed to come with Wasabi Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus, but I substituted Tempura Asparagua for regular asparagus. Our waiter, Joey was very patient with us, as we had one wholly indecisive member in our party. He had to visit 3 times before the entire table was ready, but I ordered an Herbal tea to pass the time.  So I was really excited to try Wasabi Potatoes but unfortunately I was served a GIANT pile of regular unsalted red-skinned potatoes. There wasn't a whiff of Wasabi in the mashed potatoes (which is pretty hard to miss), nor did I see wasabi on the side, so that left me disappointed. Also, I don't know about anyone else but when I order steak (and pay damn near $22 for it) potatoes should be a side! I go to a restaurant for food I can't make myself, and I certainly don't get steak and potatoes to eat the potatoes!  The meal was mostly blah potatoes, about 2 pieces of cut up asparagus, and maybe 6 or 7 slivers of damn near done steak (which I requested cooked medium) Also, I'm an adult, and I want to cut up my own damn piece of meat. Just saying. Anyhow I ate half of my giant plate of potatoes and saved space for the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake which was plated so nicely, that I almost forgot my underwhelming steak dinner.  Our waiter was busy and so I didn't bother to address the steak situation but there seemed to be individuals going around watching people eat but they didn't ask us how our dinner was going, so I left well enough alone.  Next time I'll just skip dinner and go straight to the cheesecake.

Appetizer took so long and just as I was wondering what happened to it the waitress showed up only to tell me they was out of the appetizer and asked did we just want to wait for our salads rather than order another appetizer. At that point we were so hungry we ordered another appetizer and thought we'd take it home as leftovers when the salads came. It took another 10-15 minutes for the new appetizer to come and over 20 more minutes before the salad came out. I asked to speak to the manager who came out with the salads following close behind him by the waitress. When I told him we had been there for quite a long time without food his response was 21 minutes... that's how long it took to prepare your salads because we were waiting for the grill to cook your chicken. At that point I paid for the appetizer and drinks and cancelled the salads. This place deserves 0 stars. Who goes to a restaurant only to go home hungry?? Shame on them!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=60,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

For breakfast, I love their waffles and for lunch/dinner I love the four cheese pasta! I have never witnessed a wait here longer than 5-10 minutes even on weekend breakfast days, or weekend evenings. Their service is very quick and the menu has a great variety, there's some for everyone. It's a lovely place and the mall itself is my favorite.

20,Paul K.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",27,1,1.0,2.0,2017-10-21,"Today was almost the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I ever had. First we had to wait 20 minutes just to get bread and water, then another 40 minutes or more to get our food. After complaining to the manager about the slow service he compensated us with a free slice of cheesecake. I would have rather had my meal on time. FYI they do not have free Wi-Fi that only made the wait worse. I will not be returning to this location. Not to be totally negative the food was okay once it finally arrived",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?start=40,2.8,2.68,2.68,,2.728
14,Day Y.,"New York, NY",0,18,8.0,1.0,2017-10-28,"We've been to this place many times. I enjoy TCF and its many menu options. Our family of four went there on a Saturday night. It was the standard 30-min wait but we didn't mind. We went strolling through the mall during the wait. So this is the sequence of events tonight: 7:15 - we are seated and our waiter immediately takes our drink order 7:30 - our drinks arrive in staggered fashion with the beer arriving last; we place our food order 8:00 - couple in table next to us leave 8:05 - new couple arrives at the empty table 8:20 - our waiter apologizes for our long wait and says he'll find out what's happening in the kitchen  8:25 - our neighboring couple's food arrives; I go ask the front desk (since our waiter is MIA) why we've been waiting so long for our food; manager says he'll find out 8:30 - our food arrives but we're fuming mainly because someone f'ed up and everyone was pointing fingers (manager said kitchen messed up; waiter said he had no idea; food servers said they're just doing as told). So we waited a full hour for our food (nothing complicated - Caesar salad, two steaks, and one chicken) and we told them to take it back. I said I would pay for drinks, but the manager was nice in saying that our drinks are covered. But, if anything could have salvaged the evening, it would have been a word from the manager or waiter saying that he screwed up (instead of blaming it on the kitchen) and asking us to enjoy our food with drinks on us (or some other discount for the long wait).  In any case, bring food to customers in the order they arrived and everyone should be happy. This place is a madhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings. That is just my one bad experience. I'm fairly sure by their popularity that others have good experiences. So take this for what it's worth - just one review among many.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills,2.72,2.68,2.68,,2.696
5,Kenya M.,"West Orange, NJ",88,132,399.0,2.0,2017-10-30,"2.5 stars and that's IT! We waited less than 5 minutes for our table which was great. But when we sat down, we noticed that the table was dirty and there was food all over the floor. A lady came over to clean it and insisted that it wasn't dirty! Um, we're not blind. Our waiter blamed it on a kid that was there before us which was no excuse. After we placed our order, it took 42 minutes for our food to come out &  it came our barely warm. I hate to send food back but my broccoli was ice cold! The brunch combo was extremely boring- dry pancakes, overcooked bacon and my over easy eggs were over hard!! The chicken fingers were pretty good- too bad it was paired with old celery. Our waiter was clearly over his job and it showed. So, believe the reviews that you read on here!

It was a birthday group of 15 : we called the day before to find out If we need to make reservations or maybe come in early because the group size and they stated no it should be fine to seat us all.

Food quality is good for what it is. Plenty of items on the menu from salads to hamburgers. Their Cheesecakes are good but in moderation. I think the lettuce cups are one of the best options on the menu. Still plenty of food but you won't walk out feeling disgusted and maybe even able to share a slice of cheesecake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills,2.64,2.66,2.66,,2.652

And today we finally opened the box so i could blow my candle, but this is what we see in the box a cheesecake surrounded with paper, and does not even look like a bday cake. It looks like we are going to sell cheesecake. What a disappointment on my bday. We called trying to ask maybe they could give us the one that doesn't have all this paper but they said no. And they even said that the one we got was a corporate cake. Why did we end up with a corporate cake. LMAO. Too funny.  The lady lastnight was definitely a liar and lazy. Smh.

3,Jamila L.,"Houston, TX",306,117,577.0,2.0,2017-12-28,"I absolutely adore the Cheesecake Factory.  When I come to my hometown for the holidays, we always Isis this particular location because of its' convenient residence inside the mall. This location left us extremely disappointed though. Here's why... 1. First, there was a 40-minute wait. Ok, no biggie. It's the holidays. It's 8:00pm and the mall is closing in an hour.  2. As our buzzer went off and we get up to be seated at our table, in walks a man with a little chihuahua on a leash. All of our mouths dropped. One lady with a family of 5 asked the hostess if dogs were allowed in the restaurant. The server said, only service dogs. The lady exclaimed, ""that was not a service dog & he was not blind"". The hostess just shrugged her shoulders. The lady and her whole family canceled their reservation & walked out exclaiming how unsanitary it was. I totally agreed. And had we not been starving and waited over 40 minutes, we would have left, too. Luckily, they sat us on the other side of the restaurant.  3. The service was horrible. Our table didn't have enough silverware, it took forever to get our bread and some of us got drinks while others didn't. I was with a party of four. When we requested more silverware, one of the other servers (not our waitress who couldn't be found) got it and apologized, stating it had been a crazy day. Again, cool. It's the holidays. We get it.  4. But, this last thing took the cake... we all began devouring our food, only to get halfway through & my mom finds a long, curly black hair at the bottom of her plate. We were disgusted and informed the waitress. She took the plate, came back & stayed she took it off the bill, but the manager argued with her that the hair didn't belong to any of the cooks because they were all men. Manager never came to our table to address the issue or apologize.  After the hair situation and lack of professionalism by the manager, we decided to skip dessert, pay our bill & just leave. This has left a pretty bad taste in my mouth... literally. We will not return to this location EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills,2.12,2.65,2.65,,2.438

This review pertains only to the cheesecake we got to-go and literally nothing else (e.g., service, pricing, flavor), so I strongly believe that the five stars is wholly deserved. If you've never tried one from the restaurant because of its exorbitant prices, TRY ONE! Yes, they're generally very expensive (and normally out of my budget), but they're sooo creamy. I don't even want to think about how many sticks of butter had to be sacrificed, but I am pleased. I got the fresh strawberry cheesecake (it's just regular cheesecake with strawberries) and it was AMAZING! If you like good things, you'll like this.

1,Victoria H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,6,4.0,1.0,2018-01-05,"Thinking of ordering take out? Think again. This cheesecake factory location has made me wait on the phone EVERY TIME (exactly 3) I've called to order for at least 45 mins. I get the restaurant is busy, and the server is seating incoming customers and managing the take out phone simultaneously, but 45 minutes is just not right. 30 minutes into listening to reception music from the underside of 2006, I call to politely remind the front desk that I am waiting to order. I am always rudely transferred to back to hold, without comment or apology. Then I wait out of principle. I've started to think this location likes to punish people who try to order take out. Operant conditioning to deter take out orders.  I've eaten at this location and the food is as good as at any other location. Regardless, treating all patrons with respect and efficiency is entirely lacking. If I can't order food after 45 minutes, it's not a restaurant, its a bad waiting room radio station.

0,Mark D.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,42,7.0,5.0,2018-01-08,"After such an incredible meal at Cheesecake Factory yesterday, I knew first thing I wanted to do Monday morning was leave them a five star review. I am so surprised to see so many negative and one star reviews for this location. Especially so many within the last month!  My fiancé and I were shopping at Short Hills Mall when we decided to stop in for a late lunch/early dinner. As with every other Cheesecake Factory, this place was packed. The hostess told us it would be about a half hour wait. We put our names down, grabbed a buzzer, and plopped down in the waiting area. 15 minutes later, I felt a buzz, buzz, buzz in my back pocket, we weaved our way through the herd of people waiting for a table and were ushered right to a nice intimate table for two.   Both feeling healthy we decided to order off the SkinnyLicious menu and boy was it delicious. I got the Lunch Miso Salmon substituting the white rice for spinach. My fiancé got the grilled steak medallions. Both entrees were outstanding. My salmon was packed with so much flavor. It tasted just as good as if I got it from Nobu. We also decided to split the Korean Fried Cauliflower (which was probably one of the best appetizers I had a very long time) and the Edemame. We were so full and satisfied that we couldn't even order a cheesecake. You can always count on a great meal from this place. Even our waitress was really great. She checked on us often enough, and always made sure our waters were full. We don't eat at Cheesecake factory often, but when we do come back I already know what I want to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills,2.36,2.67,2.67,,2.5460000000000003
12,Ayelet D.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,3,,1.0,2018-01-09,"All I have to say is oy. Where to begin. My coworker and I thought that the Cheesecake Factory would be a great place to conduct a business meeting, boy were we wrong. We decided to head to this location around 3pm, right after the lunch rush and before dinner service. We walked in and asked the hostess for a table for 2. Immediately we received a look and an attitude - how dare we interrupt her personal conversation with her fellow coworkers. With a sneer, she took us to the smallest two top table, when every other table/booth were open in the restaurant (we were also carrying large bags and backpacks). It took over 10 minutes for anyone to greet us and when we ordered drinks and an appetizer, we could sense the server was disappointed with our order. Since my coworker and I are both in the food business, we know how hospitality should be and we made sure to take really good care of the server. While our server was tending to another table, I asked a fellow server for 2 glasses of water- the response? ""She will get it for you"". Really? What happened to team work and helping out your fellow coworkers to ensure great hospitality for your patrons? We really didn't ask for much, but boy was this experience just miserable. To top it all off, I accidentally left a bag with my purchases at the restaurant. I called about 2 hours after i left to ask if they found a Gap Bag. The manager quickly told me no bag was found and he would call me back if they found it. I heard nothing and called back the next day, asking about the bag, and then again was told no bag was returned. Really?????? Did the bag grow legs and just walked away? So not only did I waste my money on terrible service and mediocre food, but my purchases are lost and Cheesecake made zero of an effort to help find my bag. Save yourself some money and energy and don't bother dealing with this establishment. Hopefully the management and servers can turn their frowns upside down and treat patrons properly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills,2.36,2.64,2.64,,2.528
