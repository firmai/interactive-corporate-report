David And Marie-Elizabeth P.,"Chiswick, London, United Kingdom",10,19,22,3.0,3/25/2015,"We've been to TGI Fridays in the US, Australia and now in the UK.  This TGI Fridays is representative of the ones in the US.  We went again this weekend and it was just as good as usual. Its not a fancy restaurant but the decoration is nice and interesting.  The one issue we always seem to have when going there is deciding on what we want to eat. There are just so many interesting options we want to try. Their cocktail menu is just as extensive. We've tried many of their drinks and enjoyed them very much.  We find it nice that waiters there then to crop down when talking to us so we don't have to look up at them.  Our waiter this weekend was very nice and patient with us.  The steaks are good and we really love the Jack Daniel's sauce, the Nachos are also a good choice.. and you cant go wrong with a burger.. whatever your taste is you are likely to find something suitable. we haven't tried the desserts yet as we usually fill up on entree and mains.. but one od these days we'll get to it. overall.. pretty good.  but maybe a little on the price side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-aberdeen
Maria P.,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",4,57,,4.0,5/2/2012,"The Union Square one has always provided good food and atmosphere for me and my friends and family. The quantities are lasrge, the quality is really good - people with stomach problems can eat without any problem. Once my chicken BLT came with the bacon half cooked and they replaced the plate and did not charge me at all for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-aberdeen
