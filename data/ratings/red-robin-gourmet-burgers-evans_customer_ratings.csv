56,Anthony S.,"Augusta, GA",39,79,32.0,5.0,2012-09-23,I really liked the menu with an awesome selection of hamburgers and wraps.  It has a great full bar and beer selection.  The service was good.  My only complaint is:  I want more nutritional data.  I couldn't even find anything on the internet.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=40,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005
60,Russ G.,"Decatur, GA",29,276,,2.0,2012-09-24,"This weekend the lady and I, with chirren in tow, went to Augusta for the day. On the way down we all agreed on a really good burger for lunch so I scanned my phone to see what would come up nearby where we were headed. A few choice places as well as a bunch of junk came up, but Red Robin stood out as we've never eaten at one and all agree the advertising does seem to encourage trying them out.  Got there right at 11am as they opened, quickly greeted and seated by a very enthusiastic hostess. This confused me for a sec as I thought the place was a regular fast food joint, not a sit down and order type of place. I quickly noticed the full bar but was reminded it was Sunday, no sales until 12:30. Dammit.  Scanned the menu, decided quick, and ordered. Food came out a little slower than I would assumed, there was already a crowd inside but nothing a big place couldn't get through, but it was hot and ready to eat, albeit a little displeasing. For all their hype, the burger was a letdown, cooked right (medium) but charred to death outside, and small. The bun suggested a big, thick piece of meat but inside there was a little filet of meat, not much bigger than a burger from a lesser place (Wendy's, King, McD) and just lacking flavor. The fries were soggy too, good sized order but unappetizing. I ate it all and got full but was really disappointed in the experience, especially when the bill came. For $8 Fuddrucker's BLOWS them away by miles, as does virtually any other place around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=60,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005
63,Pieter H.,"Orlando, FL",74,30,4.0,4.0,2013-01-29,"Had my first ever trip here a couple days ago, and I suppose I was pleasantly surprised having the preconceived notion that  this was just a regular fast food burger joint. It is certainly not, with a full liquor bar and varied menu, I was instantly impressed considering my very low expectations. Had I gone to this place thinking it was a full regular restaurant, it is entirely possible that I would have been disappointed, but I didn't and I wasn't and here we are with a positive review. It was much busier than I expected, however, we had no problem getting a seat at the bar right away. This man waits for no one! Though the bar tender looked a little weeded and a bit slow to take care of us, we still got our drinks and orders in without too much hassle. Decent drink selection and average beer selection. I had myself a pint of Guiness as I watched sports on the TV above the bar as I waited for our orders to arrive. I can't remember the name of my burger but it had a killer horseradish sauce on it that sealed the deal for me! The burger was cooked perfectly, albeit, a little too greasy for my liking. They also offered broccoli as an alternative to fries which is a big plus for me! I feel bad enough eating at a place like this, so it was mitigated by the fact that healthy alternatives were available. The fries I tried were nothing special, and I was truly horrified how the gentlemen next to me had a HUGE burger and full plate of fries, and still managed without any problem to get through another two dishes of their ""bottomless"" fries. The man was clearly determined to eat himself into an early heart attack. Aside from the man vs food show going on next to me, it was overall a pleasurable experience.  Bottom line: Not the Best burgers I have ever had, but pretty darn good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=60,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

62,David C.,"Augusta, GA",56,475,93.0,3.0,2013-09-18,This is the first time I have been back to red robin in a while and I was disappointed. We were warmly greated and quickly seated. I got the a1 peppercorn burger and my gf got the blue ribbon burger. They were busy but we got our food in a reasonable amount of time.  We both ordered the burgers a little pink and they were cooked correctly. The burgers tasted good but having been gone for over a year it is noticeable that the patties they use are smaller despite over a dollar price hike. The fries are now served in something that resembles a napkin holder. I dont like it because the holder is just in the way. You cant season nor add ketchup to the fries in it. Just plop the fries on the plate so I can season them and put ketchup on them. Forget the the gimmick already.Then there were the fries. Some were cold and tasted either reheated or been sitting for a long time. I asked for a fresh basket of fries and it was brought fairly quickly. They were piping hot but they just didnt taste good. Overall the atmosphere and service was ok.. the burgers were good but the fries were bad and the patties small for the price being paid.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=60,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

48,Louise M.,"North Augusta, SC",3,34,9.0,3.0,2013-12-28,"I'm not a huge burger fan so I ordered the crispy chicken salad and seafood scatter. The salad was AMAZING! I almost ordered a second one. The honey mustard sauce was really good, and they weren't stingy with the bacon bits.  The seafood scatter was okay. The clam strips and shrimp were my favorite but the fish was nothing special. Maybe because I'm not used to the taste of cod.  I was too full from the salad to really enjoy the fries but they're pretty good. I ordered a merry moscato punch and it was really strong. I was not a fan. I barely tasted any mango. It took about 20 minutes for our order to be taken and I spent more time waiting than eating.

I never noticed how loud it could be until I came in with a migraine and some bad sensitivity to light. I probably stuck out with all the families and young couples but I missed the strawberry lemonades and fries.  I notice each time I come into a Red Robins, some sort of change is made to the menu, the servers schpeel, the plates or adult beverage menu. For a corporate place, it's not very consistent at all. I come here for a blue cheese burger about once a month and I've noticed in the past months, there's a lot more veggies and less cheese and meat. It's $11 for a 1/4 lb. burger that gets cooked through basically the same kind of mechanism the pizzas as Costco are. Kinda makes me rethink my burger restaurant choice. Surely there must be a better blue cheese burger out there? Alas, I'm stuck for now. 5/2014",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

61,Sheila T.,"Evans, GA",0,6,5.0,1.0,2015-01-03,"For all the people on here giving this restr a 5 star rating:  You must not eat out very often.  I cant imagine what you could possibly be comparing this burger to.  My husband and I ate here last night and were VERY disappointed, to say the least.  Red Robin is a total rip off!   For an appetizer, we ordered the Chili Con Queso & chips.  $7.00 bucks for a small bowel of cheese that was served in the same little bowl that most resturants serve a vegetable like corn or green beans in.   Save your money on this one, get it at the Monterys Mexican restr for same price with better chips and served in a HUGE bowl!!   My husband ordered the Smoke and Pepper Burger, which according to advertisement is a HUGE , tasty, flavorful burger....for about $13.50.  What came out was a totally tasteless (except of the pepper bacon), VERY small patty on a whole lotta bun!! I ordered the bacon cheese burger for 9.99, and decided to upgrade my patty to the Black Angus patty..which costs me an additional 3.50. I knew there would be an obvious upgrade charge, but with the waitress would have warned me it was 3.50 because there was absolutely NO difference in this patty and the normal patty on my husband's burger.  So for 13.50 I got the same small, tastless patty.   They must not season their meat, because all I could taste was the mayo, cheese and bacon ..which was the only thing saving this pitiful burger. The ""bottomless fries"" were soggy and boring and tasted like they mixed fresh ones with cold ones because some of the fries were cold and some were warm.  All the fries needed to be cooked a few mins longer!!   If you want a lot of fries, go to 5Guys Burgers! This place is waay over priced for a tiny burger.  For 2 burgers, 1- iced tea, 1- water and cheese dip....my bill was  $40.00!!   You can get a burger at a number of other places in town that blow this one away.  Save your money!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=60,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

49,Joey Y.,"Grovetown, GA",18,43,40.0,4.0,2015-04-12,"This is a good place to get a good burger. I'm not going to rave about the burgers because, well it's a burger duh, but if you like variety when it comes to your burgers then this is the place for you. I had the Royal Red Robin it came with cheese,tomato,lettuce, bacon and a fried egg to top it off and all the fries you can eat. That meal alone with a drink will run you about $13.00 including tax. So yes it's a little pricey for a burger restaurant, but in all fairness this is a upscale burger restaurant if there is such a thing. The meat was cooked perfectly and the burger was good. The fries were pretty good as well. So over all not a bad meal. If you are watching your waist line this is not the place for you. There is no light items on the menu at all, yes they do have salads, but they are all loaded with calories. The service was good. We were greeted at the door and shown to a table. Our server was very polite, attentive and kept our glasses full. The restaurant was clean and odor free, bad odors anyway that is, the smell of the food wasn't bad as it filled the restaurant. The only reason I gave them four out of five stars was this and I know I'm being picky, but it did bother me and that was that the menus were sticky. If someone had taken the time to wipe down the menus I would have given them five stars. Let's face it when it comes to Hamburg type restaurants this is pretty fancy, but you will pay for that fancy stuff in the way of higher priced burgers, but hey sometimes you just want to be in a fancy atmosphere while eating a burger.

This place use to be one of my favorite places to come and eat, now that has changed and has made me want to stay far away from this place!!! Here's why!!!!!! My brother suggested this place for our birthday since it was one of our favorite places to eat and receive a great meal, were we ever so wrong. This place has changed the menu so drastically and some of my favorite things are not on the menu anymore. The once amazing Avo-Cobb salad has changed and this is one of the reasons why I loved this restaurant. Instead of a large bowl, they now place the salad on a plate. This was so messy because the salad would not stay on the plate while eating it. The salad is half the size and a lot of the things that was once in the salad have been omitted. The lettuce has also changed it's now Romaine lettuce instead of Iceberg lettuce. I'm fine with that but my mother hated this change!!!! The bar wings are still the same and pretty good. I told my family we will have to stop coming here for the salad and eat the burgers again. I hope they don't change them. Red Robin please go back to the last salad formula because this one sucks!!! I wasted a birthday dinner for subpar food, and that is upsetting!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-evans?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.504,2.96

I ordered the bleu ribbon burger and you can tell from the inside of the sandwich picture that a lot of elements were missing. It wasn't worth sending back to the kitchen a third time. The last thing anyone wants to do is piss off the cook. Ate as much of it as I could before completely giving up on it. Most of it ended up to the side in a discarded napkin. Look at the texture and thickness of the bun. Very poor quality. Looks old and tasted stale. Bottomless fries were nothing to write home about. Just regular steak fries with hardly any taste and seasoning that keep coming. That would be nice if I didn't have to beg for more. I didn't experience bottomless anything. And I didn't even get a drink refill. She practically took my initial order, disappeared, came and brought my food, and then disappeared again until it was time for me to get my check. Took forever to get my food and then it was very unappetizing when it arrived. I am not happy with the service nor quality of what I received. My burger was even cold. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews. They are telling the truth. Apparently, I'm not the only one that had issues with barely there service. Check out the so called steak fries.

I ordered the southern charm burger and my date ordered the new mac and cheese burger with garlic and herb fries. The first note was the fries were cold, and the garlic and herb fries had no garlic or herbs on them - just a tiny bit of cheese. After requesting more fries 2 more times, we finally got a hot batch.
