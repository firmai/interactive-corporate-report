14,Don H.,"Rustburg, VA",0,5,,4.0,2012-11-27,"Great food, great service. But the smoking section was causing the whole restaurant to smell like a cigarette. A good place to eat",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
7,Johnell S.,"Georgetown, SC",0,2,1.0,4.0,2015-06-04,"While celebrating my daughter's graduation, my night was ruined with dinner at TGIF. It started out with a lousy waitress. Her attitude and demeanor was not welcoming at all. Incomplete order and it was like she was rushing.  Well, after requesting for new waiting service, my salmon dish overly cooked. I asked for grilled salmon not salmon chips. This qa the worst experience n I really had like this place. They might wanna stick to ribs n burgers. Leave the seafood to Drunken Jack",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
8,Miranda C.,"Morgantown, WV",17,8,3.0,5.0,2015-06-22,Food was great and my long island for happy hour was perfect. The food was amazing. I recommend the bacon wrapped jalapeños to everyone. As well as anything covered in Jack Daniels glaze. The prices are a bit high but the service is top notch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
12,A N.,"Independence, KY",11,26,8.0,2.0,2015-07-27,"The food was good but the service was absolutely awful. Since when are salads served WITH the meal?? That is a terrible idea. From the time we placed our order to the time the food arrived at the table was well over 35 minutes. During that time we saw neither hide nor hair of our server. We were there on vacation and, as such, may never have occasion to return. But if we are in the area again we will steer clear of this particular TGIF's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
9,Stacy W.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,6,,3.0,2015-10-22,"Dined out with a friend and had TERRIBLE service. Hostess on the phone and completely disengaged. Server was a hot mess. Slow, dropping things, leaving us alone for 20 minutes and then coming back multiple times in 5 minutes to ask if we are done and need a box.  Food was good which is a little redeeming. I'm not in a rush to go back but would give it another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
5,JP S.,"Charleston, SC",79,606,42.0,3.0,2015-12-31,"Lived here about 4 years and never set foot inside.  Tonight we were forced to try it.  Been to ones in Atlanta and other larger cities, but we were without food in fridge and it was Christmas Day. Waitress was nice but a bit hovering.  She was a school teacher and did this on the side.  Felt like I came in without my homework assignment completed :(      Cheers Angela. Food was surprisingly good... for a chain that was over-busy with OOT holiday folk.  Maybe we will do again.  But likely next Xmas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
11,Jared H.,"Jeannette, PA",1,3,,5.0,2016-07-11,"Big fan of this fine establishment, great service food came out warm tasty and quick, really nothing to complain about here. It's what you'd expect from a Friday's. The staff was very friendly and even responded to me raising my hand because I accidentally drank out of my cousins drink. The waitress joked about it and quickly got him a new drink and straw. Definitely would go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
10,Aaron M.,"Hartville, OH",1,1,,5.0,2016-07-12,"Let's start off with the service.  Sara with out the H was one of the friendliest waitress's that I have ever had.  She worked hard to get our food out to us.  Give Sara a raise if possible.  Now let's get to the food.  Everyone in my family was very satisfied with the food that we ordered.  I had a rack of ribs and after I was done, I got a free hand wipe.  Those are the best hand wipes.  This was a great experience and I would highly recommend going here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
0,Joan G.,"Saint Louis, MO",182,334,1461.0,4.0,2016-08-04,"What can I say about Friday's. If you've been to one, you've been to them all. The only difference would probably be the service.  Even though we are in Murrell's Inlet where there are so many original restaurants, we decided we needed what we call some good old-fashioned cooking. So we came to Friday's and sat at the bar.  We started with the chicken tostada nachos with the peppers and pick de galIo on the side. I love how these are served with toppings on every single tostada.  After snarfing them, we went onto the ribs for me and the chicken sliders for him.  His sliders were good and a little spicy.  My ribs came with fries and slaw and the ribs were delicious.  Would I come back here?  Yes, of course I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
6,Katie M.,"Glen Burnie, MD",9,9,,5.0,2016-09-08,"This had to be the BEST service I've ever had in my life. SARA YOU ARE AMAZING! If I could have her everywhere I went I'd be one happy person! She literally had the best personality, customer service skills and just an all around perfect waitress! She was on top of her stuff and never skipped a beat. Not only was our food hot and fast but we just had an excellent experience. SARA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TURNING AROUND WHAT WASN'T A GREAT DAY INTO A GREAT NIGHT!!!!!!!! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
2,Melinda R.,"Acworth, GA",8,4,,1.0,2016-09-18,"Worst Friday's ever!  Restaurant was empty yet our order was wrong, asked for jalapeños and they only put 2 tiny ones on it, ordered sweet potato fries but regular fries came with the burger, forgot the honey mustard--which I ordered.  They offered a togo drink and I agreed and asked for a diet coke but they brought a regular coke.  We ordered the pretzels and cheese...my husband liked it but I didn't. And to top it all off, the waitress was very talkative. The price point for this visit was unbelievable.  For the money we spent we could have had a fabulous dinner somewhere else! Very disappointing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
4,Emily R.,"Warren, OH",0,21,,3.0,2017-08-03,"Average food, some of my dish was overspiced to a point i was going to cough but the jack daniels chicken was good. Their slushies were real good. Waiter kind of forgot about us after we got our food though. Would return though",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
1,Emer B.,"Royston, GA",10,87,61.0,2.0,2017-08-13,The food was okay and the service was terrible. We came in at lunch and no one was at the front to greet us. We waited as several employees just looked at us and kept walking. We finally yelled at someone at the bar and they got someone out of the back and seated us.  We ran out of drinks and they were not refilled but maybe once.horrible experience for us!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
3,Brad A.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",1,33,10.0,3.0,2017-09-04,"We (painfully) got an order for carry-out. Their online ordering system, though beautifully designed, was not functioning properly, which we learned only after spending 20 minutes on their website going thru all of the prompts and payment screens and entering in loads of necessary and some seemingly useless information. We tried the online ordering system twice and both times it failed. After all of that hassle I still had to call in our order anyway. I was hung up on during the first phone call when I said I wished to place a carry-out order and they attempted to put me on hold-they just hung up on me, and of course they didn't call me right back. They hardly had anyone in the restaurant when we arrived so it wasn't as if they were too busy to take the order or call me back. The people on the phone sounded like they could've cared less when we told them the online system was inoperative. They didn't ask what the issue was or apologize or anything as I suppose they don't realize they're personally affected by it. (Though I'm sure the proprietor probably cares a lot as that does affect them.) The girl at the bar was pleasant when I picked up the food. And the restaurant itself appeared clean and nice. We got it home and dug right in, only to find an unappetizing black hair sticking out of the mashed potatoes. That's just NASTY! We all have very light blonde hair, so it certainly wasn't any of ours. If anyone preparing the food had even looked at it they would've seen it, as the moment we opened the lid it was the first thing we noticed. The rest of the food was pretty average-Not great, but not bad. Some of it was pretty good, some of it was not good-obviously frozen and refried/reheated, very dry and bland tasting. Overall this is just another typical chain restaurant that's only as good as the leadership within it. As an example, I would recommend those reading this review to see if the management bothers to respond to this concern by posting a reply to it. Judging by the repeated indifference we experienced at this location, I would be surprised if anyone there ever even reads this review or responds to it. It amazes me how identical locations of chain restaurants, given the exact same tools and ingredients, perform so radically different from one another. Again, it's all about the leadership.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murrells-inlet,,,,,
