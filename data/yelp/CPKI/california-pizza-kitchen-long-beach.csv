Christian S.,"Pasadena, CA",634,86,296,5.0,1/12/2018,"This has been an excellent experience. NICOLE was our waitress and she was just the best. Polite, helpful, cheerful, listens and most of all its crazy because it's her first day. When you come here ask for service from Nicole.  This aside, I got the CARNE ASADA pizza and I would say it was a 5 out of 5. My wife ordered a shrimp scampi pizza that one is the way to go 5 out of 5. Beer was good, atmosphere was nice.  So to wrap this all up Nichole 6 star review, the food 5 and the environment is a 5.  I'll be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach
Lauren C.,"Los Angeles, CA",343,117,946,1.0,1/4/2018,"This is honestly the worst California Pizza Kitchen I've EVER been to. My family and I have been loyal customers of CPK for years at various locations. We keep coming back because we really enjoy their food, especially their pizzas. I have no complaints about the food here- it was great and tasted as it usually does. My main issue with this place was their poor customer service (or lack thereof). We walked in for a late lunch and everything was wrong from the very beginning. The host and hostess at the front were very unprofessional, incompetent, and not very friendly. Despite having 50% of the tables empty, they took awhile to seat us. When both of them finally decided to seat our party of 5 (because it is SO hard, right?), the solution they came up with was to put 2-two seater tables together (two chairs and a booth seat), which was clearly small for 5 adults. We didn't complain because we were just hungry. Right when we got seated, we felt rushed by the waitress to have our orders ready and then told her to give us a few minutes. I guess she must've felt annoyed because that's when the service went really downhill. She disappeared until we had to wave her down several times, slammed our dishes on the table when our dishes were ready, and spoke with an attitude. I guess she decided to get her act together later during our time there because she came back to refill our waters throughout the meal with a disingenuous facade of friendliness. I didn't appreciate her attitude, and this location was clearly all over the place, starting with the host and hostess. It is clear on their Yelp page that many Yelpers also experienced their poor customer service. I guess that can only be a reflection of their manager. I'm not tough about customer service; I really appreciate servers that are nice and we usually end up tipping them well. However, I can't stand rude employees, especially when our party has a lunch bill of close to $100. I expect better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach
Eriny R.,"Los Angeles, CA",335,147,292,2.0,1/1/2018,I came in with my family after watching Disney On Ice. The restaurant is local to the arena so it's understandable that they would be busy. Now we have experienced a few issues.  1. The host told us that the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. We checked around with other local restaurants and the wait was about the same so we decided to wait. We went to check in after 30 minutes of not being called and they said another 20 minutes to which we were furious because the kids were hungry.  2. We sat with the kids and ordered for them right away. We also ordered the waters for everyone. It seems like we got their pizzas an hour later :/ they were super hungry and started giving us a hard time  3. I ordered the steak which was the most expensive item on their menu. I ordered it medium and got it well. I gave it back and ordered the chicken and season veggies. The chicken was super dry and uneatiable. I was so disappointed. I finally order the classic Caesar which you really can't get wrong and it was good.  Overall I was very disappointed in this location. It seemed like everything that can go wrong did :/,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach
Jonathan G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,1,1.0,1/2/2018,Been coming here for 10 years never had a bad experience from cpk the company alone but this location it's self was the worse experience ever I love this place I bring my daughter and order a kids pasta and pizza and the server has the nerve and try to tell me I can't order the two items because she thought it was for me and there is supposedly a 10 year and younger age to get the items then she had the worse attitude and rolled her eyes at me ! Managers in this location need to check there servers attitude and how they are supposed to have customer service on how they treat us as customers especially when we have are family here present !!   I can again new year 2018 and I get the worse service again and they took 35 min to give me my child's food and then the waiter just assumed that I didn't want anything and they still charge me for my kids meal,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach

Kelsey Y.,"San Diego, CA",23,63,229,4.0,10/30/2017,"Came here for their Avocado Club Egg Rolls and ordered their Sedona Tortilla soup. The egg rolls were great! If you love avocados this is definitely a must while you dine here. The soup was okay, kind of on the sweet side because of the corn they have in it. Again, if you love avocados I would recommend asking for a side of it to put in the soup as well! Makes it taste delicious! :)  Overall I'm giving this place four stars for the rolls!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach
Chelsea W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,7,2,1.0,11/15/2017,I love their salads and soup- but DO NOT order a steak here. Waitress recommended the ribeye steak.

Kevin B.,"Signal Hill, CA",211,857,4993,4.0,2/22/2017,"After checking into our hotel, we walked a couple blocks to have dinner here. SERVICE: It wasn't very busy around 6 pm on a Sunday and service fine.  Our server (forgot her name) was friendly and came by a number of times to check on us, refill water glasses, etc.  FOOD: After having a late lunch we weren't very hungry, so just ordered a few smaller things to share.  Fried M&C appetizer ($4.99).  Crispy outside, softer inside, they weren't very cheesy, but still  tasty.  Not sure what the sauce was on the plate, it added very little flavor. Petite Wedge salad ($4.99).  Pretty simple but really good, loved the bacon and tomato. Bowl of Sedona Tortilla soup ($6.99).  Except for the tortilla strips on top, it looked pretty bland.  However it had some great ""southwest"" flavors going on.  Not as good as some others I've had, but still pretty tasty. OVERALL: Went on a slow evening for a light meal. Got good service, good food and a reasonable price, even though it wasn't pasta or a pizza.  A nice experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach

I love their pizza personally since they have pizzas with thin crusts. I usually get the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza, which has skinless chicken breast, red onion, gouda cheese, mozzarella, and cilantro.

My impression was that it was a casual eatery, but it felt more upscale than that. The staff were friendly and chatty, and didn't miss a beat, and helped us with our selections. The deep fried mac and cheese balls were the perfect starter,  and we shared a spaghetti dish and a pizza.

Michele G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",44,240,229,3.0,7/31/2017,"Decided to visit this place today for lunch. Turn off number one; the greeter who sat us Placed the dirty menu on top of our clean plates. That's yucky so everyone who has touched a menu now their germs are on my Plate. My friend and I decided to order the lunch special which is located on the back of the menu. We selected a turkey sandwich, salad, and one of the beverages located in section three (the mango). The glass was filled to the top with ice and probably about 3 oz of actual liquid content. When asked for a refill we were told it was not complimentary. Well heck the non complementary price should have been noted on the back of the menu near the beverages selection. also you should not fill the entire glass up with ice. I guess this is a way that the restaurant profits right. Service mediocre. I will not return to this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach

Its interesting to see the change in direction and the pizza is not really the main attraction. My mrs and some friends of mine came here before heading to Cinemark at the pike (One of my favorite theaters in California) and I enjoyed it. Very much. We got a the original bbq chicken chopped salad, and chicken tequila fettuccine. We also got a fresh strawberry mango cooler and butter cake for desert.  Let me tell you it was all delicious. The Mango cooler was super addicting and I almost drank the whole thing without noticing. My Mrs and I share everything and for the size of both portions, we surprisingly finished everything. Thats the great thing about chain restaurants, they churn out huge portions. You can't really go wrong coming to this CPK.

Alexis W.,"Buena Park, CA",0,40,2,4.0,7/24/2016,"Went on a Saturday evening and my group of 4 was seated right away. There is a nice selection of both food and drinks. We had a bottle of wine for the table and the chips and guacamole for an appetizer. It was more of a salsa than guacamole. It was basically a small pile of chopped veggies (onions/corn/beans/tomatos) mixed in a small amount of avocado. It wasn't a bad dish, just not what any of us thought it would be and the chips weren't very fresh. As far as main dishes go, we all enjoyed out meals. I had a half order of the roasted veggies salad and it was delicious! Unless you're starving I recommend half orders of the salad.

Todd S.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,21,7,2.0,8/29/2016,"Visited this location yesterday, the two pizzas we ordered were OK, but sorely lacking in protein/chicken, especially for the exorbitant price. There are too many other options that give you way more for a better price like pieology and some of the others. Our bill was almost $100 for four people to have lunch and only one beer was ordered. No appetizers or anything else. I noticed that the up charge for anything extra also. Service was good and over all the food quality is good, but I wouldn't go back due to the three pieces of chicken on both pizzas and lack of value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=100
John D.,"Clovis, CA",0,2,,3.0,3/10/2017,"I have never once written a review on Yelp but I've had an awful day and going to this place was the last straw. My day started at 7am with getting off a fantastic cruise and quickly took a turn. As I made my way up the parking structure and neared my car, I noticed that the rim and tire were completely missing. As I got closer, I realized THEY WERE ALL GONE. Obviously, it's going to take me a little longer to get home that I thought. I start by trying to talk to Carnival Cruise ship people(useless) to get this sorted out but they could not care less even though this was in their parking garage. They tell us that they only have security 5 days a week and this happened while there was no one there. How ridiculous right? So we get no help from them cause they're POS. We can't have it towed because it's in a parking garage and the clearance is too low. We can't have it pulled out of the garage any other way so we have to call a tire place so we can pick out some tires and have them brought back to put on our vehicle. Let me tell you, this tire place went above and beyond. AMERICAN TIRE DEPOT! So amazing! They were making calls for us, giving us rides everywhere, even offered us donuts. We finally pick out our tires and rims and head back to the car. Guess what, the GD rims don't fit because the holes don't line up. The family is heated man let me tell you. So the only thing left to do get a rental car and call it a day. AMERICAN TIRE DEPOT hooked it up with a rental car! They tell us it will be a few hours but it ends up being longer than that so we have to get a hotel. In the meantime we went to Yardhouse(fav of mine) and had a late lunch. We checked into MAYA HOTEL - by DOUBLE TREE which is also amazing. Super beautiful! After a few hours of relaxing after a long and ridiculous day, the wife and I decide to order some CPmfK. I order the usual, Garlic Creme Fettucine, which is absolutely delicious. The wife orders a chicken Caesar salad because she wanted something light but she can eat what she wants because she is the most gorgeous being on the earth. We drive to pick this up by the way because we're tired after this long day and of course there's no parking. Fix that s-it CPK. Anyways, I go to pick it up and it smells great so I'm super excited. I get back to the car after my mile long walk since there's no parking and head home. We get back and look in the bag and THERE'S 0 bread. The best bread I've ever had is from CPK and they neglected to put any in our take out bag when we even asked ""will we get bread?"" and the lady responded, and I quote ""yes."" Now, normally this wouldn't be an issue but on today of all days I've had it. I'm sick of being deceived and lied to and this was the breaking point. I don't know what her name was but she was the messed up cherry on top of the poop cake. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, always is. However, after the day I had this place only gets 3 stars from me. Thank you! -Dyl",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=100

Steff M.,"Cerritos, CA",5,127,123,1.0,5/10/2016,"I want to start by saying our waiter was great (I can't recall his name he was in his 20s Asian), our experience started off rough and he tried his best despite the circumstance. This review has nothing to do with our Waiter. My boyfriend and I  arrived Saturday April 30th, the hostess sat us at an elevated table near the take out pick up area. This is where the struggle began, we sat there for 15 minutes, multiple waitresses walked by stared and kept moving. Finally I flagged one down and said we have been here a really long time and have not been helped, plus we need a gluten free menu (the bf has the alergy). That young woman was in process of delvering another tables food. But she told another waitress, a blonde either a big black bow she looked at our table and obviously didn't want to deal. The orginal girl I flagged down she had dark brown hair then found the young man who ended up helping us. He informed us that our table doesn't have an assigned waiter /Waitress it's a pool area and apparently no one let anyone know we needed help. Well no one other than us flagging people down. Knowing we were anoyed the young man was awesome for helping us, especially after the blonde with the bow ignored us, she probably figured shev wouldn't get a tip since we sat unassisted for 15 minutes.  We ordered drinks my bf got a Agave lime margarita no salt, I ordered the strawberry lime margarita. The bartender messed up and made mine without the salt rim,  and my bf had salt. So those had to go back, I saw them pour my bf in a new glass, then mine in his old salted glass. Bf at this point wanted to get up and walk out, I said no which was my bad we should have left.  The pizzas come his gf one was good.  Mine was cold we had so many issues I didn't want to say anything because my bf was about to reach the lose his chill level of annoyed. The manager was obviously aware but because he seemed to circumnavigate our table when making his rounds to other customers and asking how they were doing he obviously did not care since he never came to our table. So it was clear he was trying to avoid us. The only saving grace of this place was our waiter, he was super friendly aplogetic,  and even got us a discount due to all the  mishaps. Management sucks, they need to be sure waitresses /waiters are informed of customers dining in a pooled area, abd actually try to rectify am issue and approach a table. Management never interacted with us",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=100

Jocelyn K.,"Ithaca, NY",17,172,27,3.0,11/16/2014,"I am giving this a 3 star review. I visited twice in two days (because the first visit was so good). The second visit was zero stars.  First visit was outstanding. Aside from them not having enough waitstaff and having to wait a long time to be seated, once we were seated, lunch was terrific. I ordered something that is no longer on their everyday menu-the Blt pizza. I had been craving one, and they graciously whipped it up. Other folks in my party were pleased with their food as well.  Second visit, not so good. We were seated right away. Our server had a very strange sense of humor and he thought he was funny. I didn't find him funny, and when I heard him say the same line to the table behind us that just sat down after us, I figured that this was a line he used often. Frankly, most of us are in long beach for pleasure, and we don't want to hear, about how we are having a better time than him And he doesn't want to get into it. If you don't like your job, then you should not be in the business!  That was the first bad.  Second, our food took 40 minutes to come out. After asking the server what was up, he went and checked. Said it would be a few more minutes. Finally, it arrived and so did the manager to apologize. He said they got slammed today and ran out of chicken. I was completely annoyed at this time and when he offered free dessert or free appetizers on our next visit, I just said no thank you.  Third bad once we started eating. One dish was fine, but the other was completely inedible. The chicken was petrified like it was microwaved. Obviously it was to quick thaw it. I asked the server to take it back and to take it off the bill.  The Save:  the manager came over again and apologized. He graciously comped the entire meal.

Jennifer C.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,67,85,3.0,5/29/2017,"We came in for a late lunch after going to the Aquarium of the Pacific. It was a little packed since it was Memorial Day but only about a 20-25 min wait. We put our party's name down with the hostess and sat down on the seats right next to the front counter.  When our table was ready, a different host/server than the first quickly said our party's name then walked outside to try calling out the name. My friend attempted to get his attention before he was outside but he didn't hear her. When I caught up to him outside, he was already saying the next party's name. I let him know he said our party's name, but before I could let him know we tried catching him before he walked outside, he condescendingly reprimanded me saying something along the lines of, ""If YOU HEAR your name being called, you need to actually SAY something."" Before I could even explain, he rudely turned/walked away to say the next party's name and another server was leading us to our table.  Our actual server was a nice and lovely woman but the aggressive introduction with Casey (we found out his name because he ended up being a server for a couple tables near us) honestly left a bad taste in our mouths. I used to work in the restaurant industry so I understand there are busy and hectic moments. However, I would never speak to any customer/guest the way he did to us.

I feel so bad that I can't remember her name!  Today when I went in with a friend we both ordered the shrimp and zucchini scampi. I had a water, she had an ice tea, and we loved the bread so much that we asked for an additional serving. The scampi is SO good and only 550 calories!  When I went in previously, I was with about 8 people. Almost all of us did the lunch personal pizza and salad. I think a couple members of our group did the scampi on that day.

This is not the place you want to go to over lunch. It is routinely slow.  Two days ago I called in an order for a roasted vegetable salad.  I arrived 20 minutes later at the time I was told my order would be ready. I asked if I could eat the salad at the bar instead of taking it with me.  The bartender told me I could but the salad still took another 20 minutes.  Even then, the salad had no dressing which I had to make a further request for. Over the past two trips it has taken the restaurant about an hour and a half to get me one roasted veggie salad.  I come here because it's close to work and office staff gave me a gift card to the restaurant.  Even for free, it is not worth it.  Obviously I will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=20

Paper everywhere, water leaking from each toilet, none of the stalls had toilet paper. Two out of three toilets were backed up. Disgusting. I told the manager and she simply smiled at me and said ""ok thank you."" Crazy customer service. I'm still sitting here. We have three children and they clearly have lost it for the last hour.

Will P.,"Long Beach, CA",116,29,7,1.0,1/28/2017,"Do not do take-away from this location. Rude customer service, slow food prep, cold food, incorrect orders. I have patronized this place on and off for the decade plus they have been open because (1) I like CPK food (2) they are the closest location to me by far and (3) I keep getting lulled into believing that they must have improved their service if they have managed to keep the location open for this long. Bad on me being fooled yet again. No matter how bad your craving is for CPK, choose another location. They *will* get your order wrong, serve it cold and then be rude about it. Do not let your friends talk you into going to this location by saying ""it can't be as bad as you remember."" It is. So tonight's fiasco involved an 1.5 hour prep time for the food (we ordered via Door Dash) according to the restaurant where the manager said, ""well we have been really busy, ok?"" No call to let us know that they were behind, no ""we are sorry."" I bet they do not take 1.5 hours to prepare a meal for a dine-in patron.  Turns out this was not true. Our pizza was cold and congealed and had that sheen of pizza that has been sitting under a salamander for at least an hour. No bread. Lettuce cups with two pieces of spindly lettuce. And a salad with a side of chicken where the chicken strips were squished into a dressing cup barely registering two ounces on the home scale. Post-script - called back and spoke to another manager who agreed we deserved a refund but said that has to be done through Door Dash, but of course there is no way to reach anyone at Door Dash to lodge a complaint. Alfonso said the food was ready within 30 minutes, but in the past when they had customer curbside pick up (they no longer do) the food was never ready on time when I did my own take-out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=20

Matthew M.,"Long Beach, CA",13,28,10,5.0,8/13/2016,"We came here last night for my birthday dinner. I had only been to a California Pizza Kitchen once, a few years ago. I had a good experience then, so I figured this time wouldn't be to bad. Just like their name suggests, they offer pizza dishes as well as pasta dishes. Me and my husband both went for the pasta- the same exact dish actually. We both got the Garlic Parmesan Alfredo. My husband got meat in his, but I decided to go meatless this time. The dish was excellent and delicious. The garlic wasn't too strong and had the right amount of taste to it. The amount of parmesan and creaminess to it was perfect. The dessert section on the main menu at first seemed kind of disappointing with such a small selection, but after we were finished with our meal, our waitress gave us a separate dessert menu that had a few more selections on it. I decided to go with the chocolate souffle with a scoop of vanilla ocean cream.  The cake was good. The chocolate wasn't too sweet or overly rich and the vanilla ice cream added to it was a very nice touch, even if the ice cream does cost extra. My only complaint about the dessert is the price of the extra ice cream added to it. Normally I wouldn't spend $1.75 for just one measly scoop of ice cream, but chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream just go so well together that I couldn't resist. Our waitress foe the evening was incredibly nice and helpful. I believe her name was Randi. She was around whenever we needed a drink refilled and she didn't disappear for long periods of time like other waiters/waitresses do in other restaurants. Plus, she got our check ready for us quickly since we had somewhere to be at 10pm.  Overall, quality of food and service was excellent and I'd definitely be back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=40
Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",148,593,546,4.0,10/1/2015,"Overview: This California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) at the Long Beach pier shopping center (close to the movie theater, H&M, and comedy club) is a beautifully decorated, well run restaurant that no longer showcases its pizzas but focuses on ""general"" American food like pasta, steak, salads, etc (in the vein of BJs, Cheesecake Factory, and every other American chain). The Establishment: With a new theme of sustainable decorating, this CPK combines modern and rustic together in a fashion that seems to work very well. Lots of glass for views of the pier and a beautiful long bar for singles to mingle. Attentive wait staff, slightly lower than average volume, and a slightly dim atmosphere make it a very nice place to bring a date. Outdoor seating also plentiful and well maintained. The Food: I ordered the jambalaya while my wife ordered the Waldorf salad and we enjoyed both of them, with the salad besting the jambalaya. The jambalaya had shrimp (w/ tails still on), sausage, and a decent amount of spicy kick but what I didn't like about it was the overall burndt taste and the shrimp tails still being on. While I'm sure many foodies enjoy the presentation of tail-on shrimp, I eat somewhat like a vacuum cleaner and non-edible bits slow me down. the Waldorf salad was deliciously fruity, well balanced with the cheese/fruit/greens, and well sized. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. Pricing for both was a bit expensive at a little less than $40 for the entire meal (tip included) but I suppose beach-side property rent and the recent remodel is to blame for the high prices. If you haven't been to a CPK in the past, remember that this is NOT a pizza place anymore. It's a general American restaurant that happened to specialize in pizza a few decades ago. Yes, you can try more than a dozen signature concoctions like truffle oil pizza but the entire selection of pizzas is now relegated to a tiny flap in the menu. Pastas, meat dishes, fish, and gourmet salads are now center stage and pricier than their pizzas. Conclusions: This CPK is a beautifully decorated, general American restaurant (not focused on pizza) that is located in a wonderful section of the Long Beach Pier bordering several attractions like a comedy club, a movie theater, and women's clothing shops. It's great for both families and dates, but it's a bit pricey for what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=40

Jordan C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/6/2016,"CPK at the Pike in Long Beach employee Customer Service is horrible! Myself and a co-worker stopped by for lunch, after ordering we both asked for drinks (1 water w/ lemons and a fresh strawberry mango cooler). The waiter brought my water pretty fast; however, my co-wok on the other hand waited nearly 10 to 15mins for his drink. Our food came out about 20mins after ordering and was dropped off by someone other than our waitress. Now I'm no waitress expert but the least our waitress could've done was come to our table to see if everything was ok OR if we needed anything else! When I placing my order I asked for specifics to be excluded from my salad and I receive it with everything I DIDN'T ask for in it! After literally sitting there hoping and looking for our waiter (that by the way NEVER showed up since we ordered), I flagged down another waitress that looked like she didn't want to be bothered. Already irritated that our waiter is shitty and my food isn't prepared how I asked, I asked the waiter could my corrections be made to my salad. In the mist of this, I asked for an extra side of Ranch and tomato sauce for my pizza. When receiving the side of tomato sauce it was COLD! Why would you serve someone COLD tomato sauce if their intent was to add to their pizza?! If you're ok with spending your money at a restaurant and don't mind careless Customer Service from the employees, CPK in LBC is the place to go! I definitely WON'T be returning!

Granted, there was a huge rush of cheerleaders and their families coming from a competition nearby at the time we ate. When the food finally arrived, it was not that great. Cobb salad (with beets), garlic chicken thin crust pizza, and the lettuce wraps. When I order thin crust I look forward to a crispy, potato chipy texture, not chewy and cold crust. The cheese tasted off as well. I didn't like the other items we ordered but I accredit that for my personal dislike for bleu cheese and mushrooms.

My Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza was completely cold...I guess if you want it hot, you'll just have to eat it there. I was a bit disappointed at the size of the pie. It was barely 75% of the box and the toppings looked sad and processed. The pineapples had a canned look and the chicken was a bit dry. Disappointing.  They charge an extra fee for converting regular pizzas to thin crust. Service was good and I had no problems with the phone order.

I will say that Rick was really friendly and accommodating-- he even brought me extra blueberries (twice) when he noticed my struggle to extract the blueberry from my [delicious but weak] sangria--which earned bonus points in my book.

Since we weren't getting a buzz with our carafe, my girlfriend and I headed over to the bar to try our luck there. At the bar, we were pleased to meet the bartender, Casey, who whipped us up some wicked drinks with just the kick we were looking for; kudos to Casey for delivering on that front and MORE IMPORTANTLY for his friendly and upbeat demeanor.  So here's where things get iffy: my friends and I are at CPK for about an hour and a half having a lovely time when my homegirl and I leave to the car for a while and the 2 men left at our table start getting harassed to close out the bill cuz ""Slick Rick"" is getting off his shift. My buddy said he wasn't ready to close out, as they were still ordering beers (PLUS US LADIES HADNT HAD DESERT YET!!! Hello!! Women need chocolate!!) and apparently that wasn't cool by their standards (even though EVERY other place I go out to has no problem handing the table off to someone else and sorting the gratuity issues out with management---NOT in front of the customers OR forcing the customers out!) so they eventually called over the manager, Jason, who was acting like such a tool on a high horse, you'd think he was the CEO of CPK Corporate. Naturally, my friends were already pretty ticked by the time Jason came over to force us to close the tab out and it was provoked by Jason's attitude and unwillingness to let anyone speak, but Jason had no problem verbally sparring with the customers who's only complaint about the experience was that we weren't even close to being ready to leave. Jason was so rude that my buddy told him he'd make sure to write to corporate about this-- wellllll Jason must've been pooping bricks because after walking away with major attitude, he came back and gave us only minor snark (a huge improvement), and then told us he comped all the food and only charged us for the drinks. Talk about ridiculous--nobody was asking for anything free!! Literally all we wanted to do was stay longer and spend more money (I seriously wanted dessert and a couple more of Casey's awesome mixed drinks likely followed by more dessert!)  Anyway, we left and headed to Chili's where we drank for a couple more hours, got dessert, then ate again. FYI: Chili's policy for a server's shift ending is whoever puts the food on the table gets the tip---- AND they would never have anyone close out before they're finished eating (we asked---and the server at Chili's agreed that the whole sitch at CPK was incredibly tacky)!  Thank you to the exceptionally poor management for completely ruining what would have been a great CPK experience! I do visit CPK at least once every couple months and have never had any issues so I will be going to other CPK locations but I will definitely NEVER be back to this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=200

Ron Q.,"Carlsbad, CA",4759,439,964,3.0,1/16/2016,"I normally would want to go up a higher rating here because I love me some CPK!  I suppose a 3.5 is in order.  I've been going to various CPKs since college and have loved their food ever since.  Over the years, I've found them to be consistent across the board with service and food.  This night was to be an exception. It was late on a Friday night and the kids were across the street at a convention center.  I was ordering food to go prior to there closing.  Being a Friday night, it was busy in the restaurant right up until closing the doors at 10 PM. I had called in the order at 9:20, knowing they closed within the hour.  All went well with the ordering process even though it was loud on both ends of the phone.  I ordered a couple items that I hadn't had before, the quinoa and arugula salad and the spinach and asparagus spaghettini.  Ordered both with chicken.  The person I spoke with said it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I waited for a while then headed across the street.   I arrived at about 9:50 thinking they would have either given my food away to another customer because it was so late, but it looked like they were still seating customers walking in the door.  That was nice to see.  I waited at the front desk for a moment as the host was bringing other guests to their table.  He came back and asked if I needed anything.  I mentioned that I had a phone order and he directed me to the back counter.   I proceeded to the sign and register that I was directed to and waited for someone to come by.  Lots of people did, but no one offered to help me.  Guessing at least 10 staff passed by, but said nothing.  I can only assume they were busy, but it would have been nice to have been acknowledged for standing at a register for to go orders.  I then noticed one of the waiters who passed got the attention of another staff person.  Surely he was the guy overseeing the counter.  Sure enough, he was .  He came over to a woman who was eating at the counter next to the register and collected her bill with payment and returned to the other side of the counter to process her check/ payment.  So I continued to wait.  I saw staff carrying food from the kitchen and others with plates from floor to the bus station.  Others were simply walking back and forth along the counter with nothing in their hands.  Still nothing.     Finally, the same host who directed me to the counter walked passed.  My perplexed look probably told him that no one had helped me yet.  I inquired if anyone was working the register and he offered to grab my order.  He looked at the order line and found by ticket.  The only one hanging.  He looked down and found a couple of to go containers on the counter and told me he'd check to make sure the salad was being worked on.  He came back around and found what he was looking for right in front of the other container.  He started bagging up the items and told me he'd be right back with the waters and bread and butter I had ordered.  He then went around the counter to the other side and began talking with another member of the wait staff.  The talking began to look like joking around and more social chatting than anything.   Another waitress then came by and asked if I needed anything.  I mentioned that the other gentleman was going to get some waters, but looked like he was distracted. She smirked and agreed and said she would get them for me.  By this time, a manager came by and asked if I was being helped.  I mentioned I was being taken care of.  When the waitress returned with the waters I asked about the bread and butter and she immediately went to grab and bag them as well.  The host who initially helped me then walked by with a plate of food from the kitchen, grabbed a glass of water and proceeded to sit down for a meal.  Guess he was distracted with his own break time as well.  She returned and put the bag in front of me and said, ""You're all set, have a good night"".  I then mentioned that I hadn't been rung up or paid yet. She smiled and went around the register to ring up the order.  She thanked me for mentioning that.  I paid and went on my way.   The quality of the food was great as always.  I just wish the customer could have been more of a priority on this night.   Keep on Yelp'n!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=120

When the orders were missing, they did not even apologize but simply said ""it will be out shortly"" (took another 15 minutes before arriving still). The pizza was cold when it arrived and simply disappointing. Also, while barely starting to eat, the servers would ask whether or not you wanted a box to pack your food. The food is reasonable, but the service is awful. There was so little other customers at this California Pizza Kitchen when we were there yet they could not handle such simple tasks.

We were given warm, toasty bread with olive oil dip to munch on while waiting for our meals. There are lunch special deals on the weekdays.  Pizza + soup or salad combo for $10.95: Spinach & mushroom pizza with farmers market soup. Hardly any spinach on my pizza (about 3 pieces) and overly cheesy. The soup was the total opposite! Everything fresh you could find at a farmers market meddled into one delicious soup! Farmers market soup is worth a try. While dining, the fire alarm went on. For a big chain like CPK, it's scary there were no proper procedures and employees weren't trained on protocol. All customers just looked around and so did the employees!

Bunnie K.,"Long Beach, CA",35,60,8,3.0,9/30/2010,"CPK is okay. I came here for my friend's birthday lunch on a Sunday afternoon. There were 15 people. I thought they did a good job at the most part but the wait staff is so slow. Once we were seated it took the waiter 30 minutes or more to get our drinks. There were only 3 alcoholic drinks ordered and the rest were water, soda, etc. Our waiter seemed to have disappeared for a while. I didn't even him walk by for the longest time. After a longer wait, he finally asked us for our food order. The food came out at a decent timing so I thought that was good. The food is what I expected, yummy crust with whatever toppings you decided. The birthday girl's jambalaya pasta had a good flavor but was way too salty. I shared a Original BBQ pizza and half order of Cobb salad which was delish.  I am relatively peeved that bread was not given to us while we waited. Is it because we had a big group that we don't deserve bread? I didn't mention it even though I saw other tables with 4 or less people have bread and butter. Not that our group wanted the extra carbs or calories but it would have been nice if it was present and we would have decided ourselves.  The host that worked during the lunch hour on 9/27/10 was very nice. She did a good job accommodating our big group and even offered to put my friend's flowers in water while we were seated. She gets an A+.

Kealoha V.,"Abilene, TX",1066,454,258,5.0,1/2/2009,"Pizza again?  I can't seem to stay away from pizza these past two weeks. (And I still had one more pizza that I ate after CPK. That won't be in a review though, but I will say it was homemade and it was our final meal of 2008. A meatball and jalapeno white sauce pizza. Something a certain Denver CM and her boyfriend had on their first date. :D ) We got a gift card to CPK and instead of saving it for awhile so that we could get pizza out of our system, we realized that our lazy asses had not done any grocery shopping at our new place and so instead of dealing with the grocery store, we ordered something for pick up. Sheri got herself a salad... a cobb with applewood smoked bacon. What she usually orders. I on the other hand went with a pizza. And I am glad I did. After the last few places, I needed a good pizza. We placed our order and by the time we got dressed and drove the short distance to the place, our food was ready. We ate up a little time trying to find the curbside pick-up, as it's not labeled anywhere along the street and not at all on the metal roll up door where they want you to park, a minor inconvenience, one that I can overlook. I have had pizza from CPK on 2nd & PCH before, so I knew a little of what they had and instead of going with something I have tried before, I went with the White Pizza. For those who are not sure sure what that is, it's got spinach, garlic, parmesan and romano cheese, I went and added the suggested applewood smoked bacon to it and got the honey wheat crust too. It was the perfect pizza. Not the greatest, don't be confused by my use of the word perfect. It was simply the best possible choice that I could have made that night as it wiped the taste of those so so pizzas from my memory quickly. I was no longer left with the taste of unsatisfactory pizza in my mouth. I've had white pizza's before, but there was just something about this one. I wish their pizza's were a little bigger, because I wanted there to be leftovers for the next day, sadly there were none. I am going to have to continue to try their other pizza's, but for those times when I am undecided or simply want a pizza I KNOW I will enjoy, that is the pizza I will have as my default pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=240

They were horrible!  I knew it would be busy and so I made a reservation 5 days before I was going to be there.  Our party arrived prior to our reservation time and we were told that because they were busy that they gave away our table! We were not even late! They did apologize and then seated us on the patio (which was fine. But we were not happy that they gave away our seat...what if there was nowhere available to seat us??) We then ordered drinks and appetizers. And waited for almost 10 minutes to get our drinks. The server took our food order and asked if we wanted bread while we waited for our food. We said yes and then waited. And waited. And waited. 20 minutes later and no bread, no appetizers, and no drink refills. HORRIBLE! Another 10 minutes later the server reappeared and offered drink refills and apologized that we still hadn't received anything. After another 30 minutes of waiting a couple of the meals and one appetizer came out. Another 10 minutes and a couple more plates came out. After being at the restaurant for over 1.5 hours we finally asked to speak to a manager. We had to go back into the convention across the street and 3 of the 9 people at our table still hadn't received their meal. The manager ended up comp-ing the 3 meals we didn't get (he had them boxed to-go) and then gave us 20% off our bill.  Needless to say, we were still furious! All the tables around us came after we did, got their food before us, and were able to leave and be back to the convention on time. We ended up missing one of the speakers while waiting forever for our food and the bill. I will NEVER go back to this CPK nor will any of the people with me.

By the time I came logged off the web site, I was drooling!  But I was not to be fooled.  I drooled on my computer before heading out to an establishment only to be disappointed by the actual food.  The pizzas looked so diverse and delicious.  My hankering was for a Bleunami from Islands but I've already Yelped that.  I ordered the Bleunami and a salad to go then walked over to CPK for a pizza to put on ice for later.  I was  delighted to see vodka when I walked into the joint.  Vodka and pizza.  Fucking genius!!    Alas, I was only here for take out, but I already  pegged it for a summer hangout with friends of all types.This place is like ice, too cold too cold.  (Cold: an urban expression for excellent)     Even my vegetarian peeps can roll with me here.  I did not have time to peruse the beer section, but if they have Asahi....I can drag Hana here!  There are many eateries in this generic box of downtown gentrification.  Oh, I'm not mad at them even though it is pretty much corporate slop.  But, for convenience sake...it's good that I don't have to travel to LA for the same experience.

Later on that night, I put the pizza in the oven and it came out hot and cheesy.  It was pretty good for a late night snack with a Cid specialty salad.  My next quest is to see how the Tandoori Mango Chicken holds up on ice.

My husband was about to eat a slice of pizza when a roach comes crawling from under his pizza...wow we were so disgusted....we were trying to be discrete about it, we got our waitress attention she came to the table and saw the roach she took our plates... She went to her manager and told her there was a little bug on the food.. A LITTLE BUG!!!!!! first off it was a roach second it crawled out from under the pizza..the waitress had the nerve to ask if she could get us something else to Wich we replied no way that's nasty and we left ...they have us complimentary dinners but we gave them away.

Gail L.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/3/2014,I love CPK but at this location I was so very disappointed. It wasn't very busy but it took over 30 mins to get our food and the soup came out with the entree rather than before. Everyone got their food but one of us and there was no explanation. The waiter said it would be out soon. When asking for the manager to explain where the lost salad was he said the order had never been placed and they were just starting it! He seemed clueless as to why we were upset that there was no communication about this and that we never would have know had we not asked for a manager. He eventually said they would take the cost off the bill. We told him to just forget the order rather than wait and have one person eat alone. The waiter later came to apologize and tried to have us order a dessert on them. It was a very annoying experience leaving us with a sense that no one really cared.

We sat at the bar at around prime dinner hour and a couple other fellow Yelper goddesses joined us, but the restaurant wasn't that busy.  Our bartender, Daniella, waited on us hand and foot but I think it was because our cover was blown as foodies, *cough*, Sahar!  Or it could have been that because the place wasn't busy that she was actually giving us genuine service. The first thing we ordered from Daniella were the Aussie Splashes, a concoction of Shiraz, mango syrup, Malibu, and some other stuff that made this drink taste like a Dreamsicle garnished with 3 frozen grapes.  It was yummylicious.  We then ordered the hummus and the appetizer rolls which came in ""Baja"", ""Mediterranean"", and ""Thai"" flavors.  I pretty much liked them all. Strangely enough, the best things at CPK that I love are the Thai-inspired items, like the Thai roll, Thai pizza, and Thai pasta.  I also ordered the Sedona Tortilla soup, and although I like the flavors, the pureed texture always weirds me out at the first sip.

Archie G.,"San Jose, CA",1118,1026,42,3.0,10/27/2010,"At a recent trade show in Long Beach, for 3 straight days, I stood on my feet, made balloons, and talked for over 8 years continuously. And no, I am not part of the circus. My days consisted of long grueling hours of pimping (or promoting) the product by grabbing attractive women, small cute children, or attractive women with small cute children, taking their picture, printing that picture on a balloon, and then making a balloon for them walk around the show with. Essentially, I was the creepy balloon guy. Sometimes, I would get a bathroom break, but I never had the opportunity to eat lunch and would lead to 8 or more hours without eating. So on the last day when I was ready to eat my own arm off, I realized I was better off going across to the street to California Pizza Kitchen, since my arms have barely any meat on them. So I crossed the street, ordered three pizzas from here, and managed to eat nearly 2 of them on the taxi cab on the way to the airport. The rest I shared with my coworkers who were amazed that I could eat so my food and not be ""under the influence"" of something. ""You should see me when I am under the influence,"" I said as I shoved a another BBQ chicken slice in my mouth. Anyway, the service was excellent here. My order was taken by a polite gentlemen who neatly packed my order into a ""to go"" bag. Of three pizzas I ordered, one was excellent (BBQ chicken), one was okay (The Works), and one could have been better (The Club).

Your location...so touristy and convenient (for out-of towners, that is and convention center victims) But hey, they have an outdoor patio, a few of my favorite salads and a couple awesome pizzas. OK. The food, same as every other CPK, so you know what you like already, right? Not the place to try something new and exotic I suppose. The service? Great! They kept the beverages more than half full and were happy to move chairs, tables and adjust heat lamps as necessary for us (and promptly!).  The waiter was less than thrilled we had a few menu related questions... so that part wasn't too impressive. But I'm never truly phased by less than knowledgeable waiters at large corporate chainy restaurants. The patio. Well definitely NOT the place for you and Fido to enjoy a meal together, unless you like watching Fido from a raised patio while he sits staring at you (if he can even see you) from an awkward sidewalk area. You'll be separated, also, by a fence.   We were asked if our dog was a service dog though, this was one of the few times I felt like lying...That could be considered a type of white lie, couldn't it?

Erica J.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,252,43,4.0,11/3/2012,"Wow, the menu at CPK has certainly changed.  I liked it before, but it has definitely upped the ante on taste.  Gone are some of the old favorites, but there are a lot of ""new"" things to try.  Then again, it's been a while since I've been to CPK and gotten something other than my standby pizzas, so perhaps the new menu's really old.  They do have a handful of small plate menu items, which I know for sure are new.  Looks promising! In any case, the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken salad was a fresh mix of textures and flavors, with dates, cranberries, golden and red beets roasted to subtly sweet perfection (I love beets, so I'm biased here), toasted almonds, and nicely spiced chicken.  I'd recommend it for anyone who likes Mediterranean flavors and textures, with a bit of sweet and tart and crunch.  The Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza surprisingly had a nice kick to it, not being overly spicy but having just a bit of heat to warm up the palate.  Usually, spicy at American-style food places means nothing, but this pizza carried its own.  My mom really liked the half and half Two in a Bowl soup option, with the Sedona Tortilla Soup on one side, with the Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup on the other.  My brother got the Kung Pao Spaghetti with shrimp, and I could see him tearing up from the spice of the Thai red chili peppers they use in the sauce.  All in all, the food was great, and my family had a good, quick meal, with something for everyone. On top of that, this CPK was fast, convenient, and had great service!  Our server, Devin, was all smiles, and he checked on us regularly throughout the meal.  We never had to ask for water or refills of drinks.  He was always at the ready.  The rest of the staff who brought our food and cleared our table was excellent too.  After going to other CPK locations where I've had really bad service, it was really pleasant to eat at this location and have great service.  Quick, but without making us feel rushed.  Smiles and courtesy. This CPK is at The Pike, located across the street from the Long Beach Convention Center.  It wasn't busy at all when we got there (~6pm), since I'm guessing there's more of a late-night crowd here, given the clubs and bars in the area.  There's metered street parking at The Pike, but some are only 24 minutes spots.  We parked at a 2 hour meter directly outside of CPK (on the other side of the lane).  Bring your quarters if you plan on parking at the meters!  They're old school meters, at $1/hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=220

I had to pick up my order at 12:10. I got there at 12:30.  Stood in line.  Then found out that the people in front of me have been waiting for their food that was supposed to be ready at 12:00 PM.  WHAT?  I waited for about 45 additional minutes for my food.   (Why didn't I leave?  it was a patience exercise for me that day.) Long story short:  they only have ONE cash register and apparently the register between that one and the rest of the restaurant do not ""speak"" to one another.  So I could not pay for my food and just pick up at another register (and my food was ready - I know because 45 minutes later he took it out of the warmer from below the counter).  People who have not ordered and people who have ordered all wait in one same line.

RICHARD S.,"San Pedro, CA",0,35,,1.0,4/1/2017,"After a long day at work we decided to go to CPK on Pine Ave.. Once we were seated on the patio i found a dead bug with dried blood inside the actual menu, yes dried blood!!!! That should of been a hint for us to walk away but instead waited for over 30 more minutes without a server or even a busboy offering us water. Finally got up and asked to speak to the manager once i told him about the bad service and dried bug with blood he apologized to me and got another server to take our order. Dinner was delivered to us by manager and server. We ordered the Grilled chicken, Tequila pasta, and pizza that was actually OK !  The manager once again came to our table and apologized about that bad service and dead bug with dried blood on menu. He said he will be  taking off the two drinks from the bill. Really after waiting 30 minutes findind a dead bug with blood????

Judy S.,"Lakewood, CA",3,69,22,3.0,2/20/2015,I've had just okay experiences coming here. I work very close to this location so I usually come here during lunch. The food is always great! The parking situation sucks though. They have a parking structure but it's a bit of a walk. You can get it validated. There is also meter parking but there's usually never any open spots. The last time I came here the service was pretty slow to be honest. Our food took awhile to come. I'd say a good half hour. Also when they brought our food they got our order wrong so we ended up having to wait longer. It took quite awhile also for them to bring back the check and to box our food. Coming here on your lunch is not ideal since the service is pretty slow. I probably won't be back here for lunch. I probably will still order takeout though since I enjoy the actual food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=140

Megan B.,"Long Beach, CA",27,57,1,1.0,12/10/2014,"Horrible experience. Never again. Ill Try to make this short. Phone ordered a curb side pick up.  Gluten free crust, oil and garlic sauce, no cheese, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and red onions only. Then 1 garden salad, NO CHEESE, NO DRESSING.  Got to curbside location 5 mins prior to time quoted.  Curbside spot is taken by someone who clearly parked there, and left to go elsewhere. Great ill call in and circle around and hopefully they move, they never did. Called and let the gal know, asked her were I should park so they can make it out to me, she told me to park in the bus. Sounds like a horrible idea.  So I tried to weasel my way into the drive way area, in front of the bus zone so I wasn't run over by the next bus. But after 15 mins no one comes out with my food. I call in and she tells me ""sorry we are just really busy right now, I'll tell them again"". Great. Another 15 goes by. REALLY ?! I call again, this is my 3rd call and I am pretty much over it. She said she would send someone right out. 10 mins and a gal comes out, has a receipt for a total only, no itemized listing and its 33.00. EXCUSE ME? 1 pizza and 1 salad, I question her and she says she doesn't know what I ordered, this is just the receipt I have to sign and she needs to swipe my card. Whatever, swipe away I'll pay if I can just get out of the bus zone(because about 6 buses have nearly run me over in the past 40 mins), and go home and eat. Sign away and I'm off.  When I get home I pull out the salad, it is small, and it has cheese on it. WASTE. Then I open the pizza, it is no longer warm, there are no artichokes, and no onions. Just, count them, 15 mushroom slices, on crust, that's it. NOTHING ELSE. No olive oil, not the rest of my toppings. Just some sad mushrooms slices on some cold crust. So I pick up a piece and I realize something is wrong. I cannot physically break the crust. Not with my hands, so I slam it on my table, nothing. Everything I pay for is a WASTE. I take pictures of it all. I call and ask for the manager and I am told ""he is very busy tonight I don't think he can speak to you, please give me your number""  Next day no phone call, so I call them. Tell that manager my sad story and he refunds me the entire bill. Thank goodness. the 1 star is for the refund. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=140

I watched her very closely and she was so attentive to every other table she had but my husband and I!! I became more and more annoyed by her everything I asked for it was like as if it was a big bother to her like I said before this lady did not speak I think the whole time we were there I heard her speak to us maybe a total of 3 times! Everytime she came up to the table she just stood there for a second or 2 and then walked away if I asked for something I got a head nod when I asked for the bill is when I got the most response from her!! This was the worst experience ever! And I really hope CPK revises and really pays attention to who they hire from now on because I'm pretty sure there are plenty of people in Long Beach who need a job and who would be a lot more professional about it then this! I don't know if my husband and I look mean or if we said something to upset the girl or if it's because my husband is Asian and I'm Mexican but I have never felt so uncomfortable before even talking to the manager when we complained about it to her he was so quick to rush me off the phone and he wanted my address to send me coupons! Now maybe this is me being paranoid but I didn't not feel comfortable at all giving my address out after telling him about what a horrible experience we had there let me be clear though I WASNT COMPLAINING ABOUT IT TO RECEIVE A FREE MEAL OR COUPON I JUST HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE TIME THERE I DIDNT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO FEEL WHAT I FELT.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=140

We sat out on the outdoor patio since the weather was real nice. Our waiter Tyler come over right away to take a drink order. He was so nice and had a bit of a sense of humor. He was very personable and courteous the entire time.  I think CPK has some of the best salads for great prices, i usually order a half portion which is still a great size (see my photo) I like the option of having half and full size portions. The bread was soooo good, baked to perfection and man that damn dipping oil...mmmmm good. I believe its pesto and garlic that's at the bottom of the oil...its so delicious, we couldn't stop eating it. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, my sis ordered the Jambalaya and my friend ordered the Alfredo with chicken All 3 dishes were very good. My salad was fresh, not soggy or over dressed with dressing. My sisters jambalaya was excellent. It was spicy but very tasty, not over powering to the point where you couldn't enjoy it. If you want pasta with a kick then order this. The Alfredo was good too, not to dry but nice and creamy.  For desert i ordered the chocolate cake with ice cream. it was cool. The presentation was a bit sloppy i guess cause the ice cream had melted a bit before it came to the table, but i still ate most of it. The cake was good, brownie like, nice and moist. it was a great dining experience overall, i love this location and will return.

It had been in the heating compartment below the register the whole time. She had only put a couple pizzas in there once. Didn't think much of it until she grabbed that gentlemens order straight from the cooks. My pizza had been sitting in there the whole time.

This is one of my favorite restaurant chains to go to so my husband and I went to this location around 2:00 pm for a late lunch. I already knew what I wanted to order because I had been to this restaurant many times in Hawaii so this should have been a fast lunch. When we were walking in we saw a table of people from the patio get up and leave. When we got inside there was no host or hostess at the stand. when she appeared several minutes later she was very rude and when we asked to sit outside she said there were no seats outside for almost an hour (she did not even check outside) we pointed through the window at the empty table and said theres one we want to sit there. She said she could not seat us there for 10 minutes because it needed to get cleaned although there was no one ahead of us in line. After ten minutes, she took us to the empty table. Again, I already knew what I wanted to order and after the 10-20 minute wait at the front, my husband knew what he wanted to order. NO ONE came to our table to help us!! One male server passed by us to help the table next to us three different times, he never said hi or spoke to us at all. One female server passed us four times to help the tables on the other side of us and she also did not speak to us at all. The manager even came out to deliver food to a table and he said nothing to us either. We sat there for almost 30 minutes with closed menus and no one offered us drinks or even spoke to us. My husband asked the female server who our server was and asked for them to help us right away. No one did. Finally, when the male server passed us a fourth time, my husband had to very loudly ask for him to help us and the male server said I dont think you are my table and went inside. We proceeded to get up and leave after spending about an hour without getting any service during a time when the lunch crowd had already left.

Lisa F.,"Atlanta, GA",0,59,58,4.0,10/12/2016,"Service was excellent and the buffalo cauliflower was delicious. My first time trying this item anywhere. I would definitely return for the cauliflower. The pizza was okay, toppings were fresh but it was still just above average, not great at all. But I'm a Chicago deep dish lover so I'm biased.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=80

Anton E.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,1153,671,3.0,9/30/2014,"oh god the service was horrendous at this location!! I love CPK and so does my girlfriend, but the service was just moronic!!! the only good service we had was from the hostess taking us to the table! okay so before getting into the bad service, lets talk about the wonderful food i ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pizza, not too spicy, loaded with veggies and meat, delicious crust, cheesy, and came with some cilantro ranch dressing to cool things down girlfriend got the tequila chicken, could've used more chicken but very good sauce to dip the crust in we also both got strawberry lemonades but shit $7 for two lemonades?? okay so now the service; after being seated we were greeted by the waiter no more than 2 minutes after the hostess left us with the menus..and right away he asks if we are ready to order..like dude wtf chill we just sat down and the restaurant is empty so, we ordered drinks and he came back...asking again....clearly seeing our heads still in the menus..if we were ready to order...and again we told him no. he told us he would give us 5 minutes (seriously, you are timing us?) and i kid you not, he comes back after a minute, stands next to the table and starts talking about the weather...dude LEAVE!!! holy crap chill once again, he leaves after asking if we were ready to order...which we were not...and comes back when we just had it and ordered then out of no where in the middle of eating, another random waiter comes by saying he is the one who brings drinks, BUT he is shaky and might drop them..and then he goes into being a new resident to Long Beach asking us what's there to do..well guess what bro we aint local either!! i didn't leave any tip because of these two morons, who turned what was supposed to be a relaxing meal on the patio into a rushed hop scotch nonsense.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=80

Kory T.,"Boise, ID",5,25,,4.0,7/15/2016,"First time at a CPK and I thought it was great. The servers at the bar were very communicative to the customers and the staff, and though busy rushing around, seemed to have a bit of chemistry among each other that gave off a 'we can at least tolerate working with each other' vibe. The food was excellent and although a little pricey, it was very filling without being overwhelming. So,a very excellent visit. It'll be a pleasure to visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=80
