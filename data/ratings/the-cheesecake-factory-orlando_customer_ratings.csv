The wait staff is friendly, knowledgable and helpful, ready to recommend their favorites. The menu is huge and covers a lot of different kinds of food, but I'm always drawn to their chicken entrees. As for their desserts... they don't call it The Cheesecake Factory for nothing! SO many options, and I have yet to try one I didn't like!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=320,4.08,4.08,4.08,3.7,4.08

192,Joy J.,"Orlando, FL",12,334,2636.0,5.0,2012-01-29,"5 Stars goes for the Fried Sweet Corn Fritters!!!! OMG - I  have heard from others to try this appetizer and Last night was IT! I ordered this along with the Vietnamese Tacos and the Red Velvet Cheesecake. The Wait for us was about 90 minutes due to we wanted a ""Patio Seating"". We were there last night on a Friday night and it was pretty packed perhaps it was at the Millenia Mall and also a Friday. The service was okay due to we had to remind the server to refill the drinks.  Let me review the Food -- Fried Sweet Corn Fritters : I very much and also my palate enjoyed this appetizer. It was crunchy outside yet so soft and pillowy and somewhat creamy on the inside! Orgasm in the mouth! Its hard to really describe the pillowy taste of this goodness. The crunch of the sweet corn niblets added some touch to this food. The dipping sauce somewhat helped compliment the food it tasted of a honey mustardy sauce with a hint of spice. I took my time eating these (you get about 5 pcs per order) because i was just savoring the deliciousness of these fritters! Vietnamese Tacos - They used chinese soft white buns (similar to bao or siopao) that is split in the middle and stuffed it with bbq shredded asian pork and condiments of cilantro, bell peppers, onions and carrots. It is similar to a petite Bahn Mi but served taco style and the bread was more of a  fluffy bread and not toasted compared to a Bahn Mi. This was also tasty but so much reminded of eating asian bbq prk buns or siopao..There was a hint of spicey hot shredded vegetable that disturbed my palate for a few minutes. You get 3 small tacos for this appetizer. The presentation of this appetizer was colorful and great on the eyes. Red Velvet Cheesecake - This is my 2nd time on different occasions having this slice of dessert. I always go for it because the red velvet is actually GOOD!. The whole combination of the cheesecake, white chocolate shavings on top and red velvet cake is really music to my palate! It is somewhat rich so this time I didnt get to finish the whole slice. (to go pls?) Seating on the patio is I think a better experience than eating indoors due to the fact you get the view the array of people that shop at this mall and what shopping bags they have on their hands! LOLS Also it is not as loud as indoors IMO. The downfall to the patio is the heater lamps in which some complained it was too hot! Service could have been better with the drink service - However the food wait was not bad. Planning on coming here again for Brunch in a few weeks! Hopefully Patio service is better than last time we were here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=200,4.04,4.04,4.04,3.7,4.04

Tonight all three hit!  Vietnamese tacos for us both, gumbo and miso salmon for entrees. All really tasty, very (too?) big portions.

292,Jared V.,"Clermont, FL",44,194,17.0,4.0,2012-05-12,"I love this place.  I have liked the Cheesecake Factory since the first time I went to one in Chicago when I was 15.  The menu is ridiculously large-- it's a good thing this place is always packed because if they didn't sell everything on their menu regularly it would be a fortune to store all the wasted food. I have had several dishes but usually gravitate towards just a few after having some stuff I didn't care for.  I usually go for the cashew chicken or a burger, which they do really well.  I also almost always order an appetizer here (if you're gonna cheat on your diet, might as well do it right) and have found that their fried macaroni is excellent, as is their buffalo blasts.  There's never enough sauce or dressing for the buffalo blasts, and I always have to ask for extras at least twice (once to my server, and since they always forget when plating the dish, once to the person that brings me my food).   Of course the desserts are amazing.  They have really taken their namesake into consideration and make some truly excellent cheesecake.  Their hershey's chocolate cheesecake is outstanding.   The service at this location is pretty good. I've had pretty attentive service and have run out of beverage only a couple of times, but I have seen a couple of unprofessional things (a male server standing a couple of feet away from my table styling his hair and pulling it back into a ponytail, for instance).  Nothing to be too offended by, but still-- do that before you get to work or in the back so your guests don't see you putting your hands, hands that deliver food and beverages, all over your hair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=240,4.04,4.04,4.04,3.632,4.04

BUT, this place pulls it off!  So let's start with Appetizers: FRIED MAC & CHEESE BALLS!!! THE BEST BALLS I EVER HAD! LOL They are so good, I have to have them any time I am at the Factory. They are creamy, the pasta is cooked al dente, the crispy coating it perfect. If you like mac & cheese you'll love these balls!!! LOL Next, Chicken Pot Stickers, once again a winner. They are light, the wonton is great and the dipping sauce, mium. On to the meal: Go for the Specialty Item of Caramel chicken. Every bite is white meat, crispy, and the Vietnamese caramel sauce is soooo good. Mixed with the rice and veggies, it is an explosion of flavors! It is my favorite dish. The Kobe Burger, ordered medium rare, was really good. It was flavorful and juicy. Tried the Thai Chicken pasta, this was the least of my favorites. It was salty and the pasta was clumpy, I'd stick to something else. Now, the CAKE! I will go in order of goodness: 1. Pineapple Upside down cheesecake! OMG! 2 of my favorite cakes, in one!

One thing I have learned is not to order steak from anywhere besides a steak house, because my medium is never severed medium but rather  'medium well'.

We already knew what we wanted because we checked out the menu online.  The wait time was 25 minutes. The place looked nice but it was definitely crowded, which was expected. When we were seated we didn't get the booth that we requested but the hostess was extremely nice and made sure we were seated at a booth. Appetizer: Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip- My family liked it, I only tasted the chips.  Bread was okay but the butter was delicious. Food: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta- My brother thought it had no flavor, only spice. Grilled Salmon- My sister said it tasted like steak, I tasted it and it really did taste like steak with no flavor. Herb Crusted Salmon- No flavor. It was bad. The only good thing was the mashed potatoes. Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi- My mom said her salmon tasted like medicine, at least it tasted like something, unlike mine. She did not like the shrimp at all. Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane- My dad is not a picky eater. He was the only one that ate all of his food but only enjoyed the mashed potatoes.  We were all disappointed and I was ready to give this place two stars but my brother said ""let me taste their cheesecake, it is called the Cheesecake Factory"". He ordered the red velvet cheesecake and liked it. My sister and I split the strawberry shortcake because we hate cheesecake. We were happy with our desserts and with the service we received so I changed my rating to three stars.  First and last time at TCF. This is what we get for venturing out of our normal routine. I'm glad others enjoy this place but what a waste, at least we were able to laugh about it and still enjoy our family night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=220,4.04,4.04,4.04,3.66,4.04

The best thing about The Cheesecake Factory is definitely its menu.  It is pretty difficult to not find something you want to try.  While some dishes are certainly better than others, I can't say there is anything I have particularly not liked that I have tried here.

We were visiting Universal Studios in Orlando & wanted to steer clear of City Walk, so we came to the Millenia area & chose to dine at Cheesecake instead. It was about 8:15, and we were told there was a 45 min wait (not surprising). We were lucky, though, and found a high-top at the bar immediately without waiting.       We both ordered 20 oz craft beers ($8) and received them within minutes. I had the baja chicken tacos which were served in corn tortillas with avocado, fresh creme, tomatos & cheese. They were very tasty but I had to eat them sans-tortilla due to the tortillas being so fragile & falling apart. Otherwise, was not disappointed with my order.       My husband has the Shepherds Pie & it was AMAZING! It came out piping hot with a mushroom gravy, carrots, mashed potatoes & beef. I probably ate half of his dish too. We were too stuffed for cheesecake & opted for a couple laps around the mall following the meal. Overall, excellent service, speed & taste!

At other Cheesecake Factorys I have been to you then wait in a small line among others who are also being seated so I thought nothing of it.  The manager then walks up to my husband and I and tells us he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience and he will be giving us a free appetizer.  My husband and I did not even realize there was an inconvenience because this little pause is very common at other locations.  We were kind of confused why he seemed so eager to help us and when we were actually seated we learned from the hostess that there was another party who seated themselves in what was supposed to be our booth.  So, they scrambled to find another booth for us.  While we were ordering our drinks, the manager came over to our table, apologized for the inconvenience and told our waiter that we were to receive a FREE APPETIZER AND FREE CHEESECAKE!  He again thanked us for our patience and apologized.  We could not believe it.  It was amazing customer service!  Most restaurants do not care too much about pleasing their guests.  This manager, Shannon, went above and beyond and we cannot say enough about his interest in making the guest experience a fabulous one.  Additionally, the food was excellent!  Very fresh, hot and tasty!  I will certainly be revisiting this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=340,4.08,4.08,4.08,3.7640000000000002,4.08

And he has a cool tattoo on his right arm! He was very attentive, but not annoying, and he took very good care of my boyfriend's little brother, who is severely allergic to milk. Most restaurants and servers don't go far to make sure that he has a good time or try to see what other options, but he went above and beyond for him. So if you ever go to this one, ask for Pepe!  What I love about their menu is that it has so much variety. My favorite is the Crispy Chicken Costaletta - the lemon sauce is so yummy! It has 3 fried chicken patties and it comes with mashed potatoes & asparagus. I order this dish like 9 out of 10 times! Crazy, I know.  I'll give this place a 4.5. I was so amazed with the service.

The service was friendly, but nothing really outstanding.  When we got to look at the menu, it had a lot of different foods which was awesome. You can overdo variety but they had just enough for everyone to be happy.  Dinner was especially yummy and when we got cheesecake, I settled with the mango key lime cheesecake it was so good. I love their cheesecakes and they'll always be the best to me.  Besides the medium wait, I love this place and can't wait to go back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=280,3.96,4.04,4.04,3.636,4.008
103,Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2794.0,4.0,2014-04-23,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I wish we had some in Canada. If it's where I am on vacation, I will always try to go. The only issue is that there was a long wait time for a table, as with any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. At 7pm, the wait was 1 hour 20 min. As we were super hungry, we instead waited around the bar area for a table. These are first come first serve and we spotted a few tables almost leaving. We ended up grabbing one in 30 mins, which is a much more reasonable wait time than 1 hr 20 min. The waiter we got was very friendly, but since it was so busy there he had a lot of other tables to go to so at times we had to seek him or ask another waiter for him. It's always hard to order from the Cheescake Factory. Tons of variety and I want to eat everything. Factory nachos: huge plate of nachos with lots of stuff on top. The cheese seemed to be the cheez-whiz kind instead of shredded cheddar, though. Lots of toppings, generously layered, 6 people could share as an appetizer. Firecracker salmon: a must whenever we go. Super crispy, tasty salmon, very delicious. Underneath there is a bed of cabbage in a delicious sauce. The salmon is to be dipped in the brown sauce that is quite salty but tastes sooo good, especially when covering the cabbage ""salad"". We got the one on the regular menu because it comes with more pieces, whereas the one on the Skinnylicious menu has less and is not as worth it. Skinnylicious menu, lemon-garlic shrimp with pasta: The light menu is a great addition to the already humongous menu. There was really a light sauce with the pasta, and a few giant pieces of shrimp. It's supposed to be 550 calories and it really tastes like it. Perfect for those who don't want something heavy to eat. Skinnylicious menu, ahi tartare: it's chunks of raw tuna on top of avocado and in some dressing, with four chips around it. Pretty good, small portion, quite tasty. We always get this one too. Asian inspired! Chicken Bellagio: This could be shared between 3 people. It's a creamy pesto pasta with proscuitto on top and two giant fried chicken steaks. I don't have a picture of this but it was amazing. Quite a heavy dish and I don't think one person can finish it. Perfect for sharing and a good value! Key lime Cheesecake: this came with two huge dollops of fresh whipped cream. It's a little much for us so we just push it aside. The key lime cheesecake was quite sour and very hard, as if it was just frozen and still defrosting. I still ate it of course, but I personally would have ordered any other cake on the menu! Too sour! Overall, it was great. I love eating here and would go again. Not too keen on the long waits (reservations not allowed after 5pm). They even ran out of buzzers because so many people were waiting. Also, they seem to be a little understaffed although they should know how busy it gets every single night! Either way, love it here and would recommend 100%!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=120,3.92,4.04,4.04,3.504,3.992

I was good just really small and thin, so for 4 people I suggest to get another appetizer too. I got the mushroom burger. It's really delicious they use  lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese. I subbed fries for steamed broccoli it came out perfect. My burger was medium-rare. My man got the Smokehouse Burger. Smoked Bacon and melted cheddar with crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce. He subbed fries for the sweet potato fries. Everything came out perfect and juicy great tasting combo. His brother ordered the Chilli Relleno Burger. It's  Charbroiled and Topped with Housemade Chile Relleno on a toasted Brioche Bun with marinated Onions, Chipotle Mayo, Cilantro, Lettuce and Tomato. It came with fries.he loved his burger.

The tables are very tight.  We were placed in a two top along a wall of banquet tables, practically sitting on top of the table next to us.  It was fine, I was just happy to not have to wait the normal 45 minutes. We were immediately greeted by our server and we placed our order right away.  I am on the hunt for the best veggie burger in Orlando so that was an obvious choice for us, and we also ordered the lunch salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Our server brought us bread right way as well.  About three minutes after placing our order, we were informed that the kitchen had not prepped the veggie burgers for the day.  In looking through the rest of the menu, there are not a lot of choices for someone who doesn't eat a lot of meat.  There is no vegetable plate, there is no veggie sandwich.  The offerings were limited to a few salads and a couple of pasta dishes in which we could omit the meat.  I rarely order salads out anymore as I can fix a giant bowl of lettuce in my kitchen at home along with the toppings of my own choosing.  I think most Veggie Heads are tired of salads being our only options when dining out. I was devastated they ""forgot"" to prep the veggie burgers. The Salmon Lunch Plate was very good.  There are three styles of salmon to choose from- herb crusted, miso and plain grilled.  We tried the herb crusted salmon and it was some of the best salmon I have ever had.  The herbs weren't overpowering and complimented the fish very well.  The dish was served with a small scooping of mashed potatoes and three spears of asparagus.  It was a lunch sized plate, a decent portion for myself.  For someone like Chad who has a little bit of a bigger appetite I would recommend ordering the dinner salmon instead. We didn't bother with getting cheesecake.  I was bummed and wanted to leave. Our service was excellent but it is definitely not a place to sneak in for a quick lunch.  Plan your visit for a leisurely meal and make sure you don't get your heart set on any one thing on the menu like I did.  We will probably not return- I don't want to wait for a table only to find out they are out of the few things I can have. I really had my heart set on that veggie burger. 3 Sprouts- I would love to give 5 here but the kitchen just can't ""forget"" to make something on the menu. Especially to your veggie friends.

On top of that, it appeared as though the waiters were overworked, and frequently saw them running around appearing stressed.  In all, it was a mistake to come to this location, especially on a Friday night. When I return to a Cheesecake Factory, it will most definitely be the one in Winter Park.  One cool thing, though. Rather than giving you a pager while you are waiting, they now simply enter your phone number. When it is a few minutes before your time to be seated, you will receive a text.

Let me do my very best at making an attempt to start somewhere, though I have so many things to say.  First off, upon going to The Cheesecake Factory at Millenia, I knew (thought I knew) what I was getting myself into. Its a chain, it is overly crowded, and the food is simply ok. The sad truth is that this establishment has been slowly declining over the years, and I remember as a teenager going here and having great meals (like their kobe burger). I regret to inform you, but those days are long gone my friends. My significant other and myself arrived starving. What we wanted was simple, and we weren't expecting gourmet: A chicken salad and a southwestern omelet. Two things that I frequently eat and can easily make for myself at home. So, it should be expected that any decent chef should be able to make these items with his or her hands tied behind their back. Right...  We placed our order; we waited. While we did so, I requested a laté. What I received was a water glass that was filled to the brim with coffee and foamed milk (oh yes I included a photo!). At first I thought it was iced, given the presentation and the fact that there was a straw included in the glass. Upon touching the drink I was shocked. It was laughable honestly. I have never seen anything like that before in my life. Quality folks! Quality over quantity. Its pretty hard to mess up something so simple, but that being said, they couldn't even properly cook our omelet. Its funny how the more I write about my experience, the more sense everything begins to make and the more I realize how truly horrible the meal was.  The omelet was overcooked and rubbery. Kind of like one of those yellow gloves you use to clean the kitchen. Enough about the omelet. On the pear and endive salad, I asked for the dressing to be placed on the side. What I got was a pile of drenched butter lettuce that looked downright sickly. It lacked color and the pear on the salad looked far from ""fresh"".  Sad. Two stars for the unfortunate food and the long wait accompanied by slow service. At least our waitress was kind! She was understanding and accommodating.  So I will now pose a question for you to meditate on as you contemplate your next meal with The Cheesecake Factory at Millenia. Why not skip the long wait and go to Denny's?

This particular location; however, has a number of problems. Being located at the Mall of Millenia felt like an advantage. I mean, it is a phenomenal spot. As a result, this location is packed to the brim with tourists. The hostess area is simply not large enough. I lost count of the number of times I was elbowed. So much so it became a conversation piece. The hostess staff definitely seemed in over their heads. Just abrupt, insincere and lacking care. Felt like I was doing them a disservice by being there. Just a poor experience.  After waiting longer than estimated, we were finally seated. Our waitress seemed sloppy and anxious to slip away. Inattentive and long waits between checking in. Case in point. My significant other ordered a traditional latte. What she received was a large water glass full of a poor interpretation. Disappointment mounted having to wait to address the big gulp coffee mess. The food was the last straw. I ordered a simple omelet. What I received was an overcooked slab of plastic. My significant other ordered a salad requesting the dressing on the side. Of course, she received a bowl of lettuce drenched in dressing. Ultimately, we were too fatigued to wait for replacements.

Our server was attentive and charming throughout the night. I had a passion fruit martini, with blood orange. Wow! So flavorful and fragrant and strong! Yum! Hubby had a piña colada and it was kind of blah... It was a virgin though.  For the appetizers we had the chicken wontons and the avocado egg rolls. Crispy succulent deliciousness. The sauce with the avocado egg rolls was sweet! That surprised me, and the fact that it went perfectly with the eggrolls.  My husband had the filet mingnon for his entree and it was beyond perfect. It was juicy even though he likes it well done. And sooooo tender!   I ordered the fish tacos. They were ok.. A bit bland but after a few sprinkles of salt they were good. They were tempura fried and on a corn tortilla. Also they would benefit from some hot sauce in my opinion, but there was none on the dish so I just left it.  But the STAR of the show was the cheesecake. My hubs got the s'mores one which was delicious, not overly sweet. You can taste every layer separately and the whipped cream and homemade marshmallow is top notch.  But mine.... Mine was... HEAVEN! White chocolate macadamia nut with a caramel drizzle. The name sends shivers down my spine. lol! Next time I will have dessert first. And if I have room maybe I will eat something else.  This thing was phenomenal. Not exaggerating.

291,Michael G.,"Orlando, FL",60,261,506.0,4.0,2015-07-16,"Lots of times when I'm in Orlando, I end up eating here. Why? Well first of all, if you're craving some good cheesecake, you've come to the right place. Personally, I think I'm always craving cheesecake, especially from The Cheesecake Factory. This location is pretty centrally located in Orlando and located right near the highway. Despite its convenient location, there always seems to be a lot of traffic around Mall at Millenia, plus, good luck finding a parking spot near the entrance, but there is valet... I can't think of a time that I've come here and not had to wait for a table. Unfortunately, you can't make reservations in advance, so once you get up to the host/hostess you get on a wait list. Waits during prime lunch and dinner times, especially during the weekend can easily be over an hour. One good part about the wait, is you receive a text message when your table is ready. The food here is pretty consistent, which is definitely a positive, plus the complementary bread and butter is always delicious! They have a great grilled cheese here, but I highly recommend asking for cheddar instead of American cheese. The portions here are usually pretty big and there's no exception when it comes to the grilled cheese. They practically use a whole loaf of bread for the grilled cheese. I sometimes get the kids grilled cheese because the portion size is smaller but still more than enough. The ratio of bread to cheese is always perfect. I must say though the side of fries it comes with are nothing special. The fries are unusually slightly flimsy and don't have much flavor, but I've definitely had worse fries. The cheesecake is always my favorite part of the meal. You can't go wrong with any of the probably 25+ choices to choose from, but my favorite is by far the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. Just to let you know, most cheesecakes come with whip cream already on top plus when you order they put more whip cream on. With the huge menu here, you're bound to find something that you like - and be prepared to end up getting some of your meal to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=240,3.4,3.67,3.67,3.408,3.5620000000000003

But today was my cousins' birthday so I had to attend... I was in the mood for something bland and lifeless, so I ordered the Crab Hash. It was perfectly executed (in terms of being bland/lifeless) with a side of undercooked potatoes. In an attempt to add some type of flavor, they drizzled a weak hollandaise sauce over the Crab Hash, but failed miserably. Not even Tabasco sauce can save this dish from the pain and suffering it endured. The servers' attitude certainly didn't help either.

Ryan F. Was not pleased with me! Lol. I should have listened to her. Ok first of all we waited for over an hour for a table, they have a huge menu and while some people may love that, I feel that it's a bit overwhelming. I never know what to choose. I decided to get a few appetizers instead of an entree. The egg roll sampler looked cool but OOPS! SALMON! I'm allergic to seafood. So I asked the waitress if they could switch the salmon egg rolls with any one of the others in the sampler.  She went to check and said No! What?! Why?! So they can take it off, charge me the same amount and not add the other egg rolls. So the server's response was. ""Sorry, I just work here"". I ordered the chicken pot stickers and Texas egg rolls, awesome flavor and good portions for appetizers. My husband ordered the steak tacos which he said were good. And my son had the grilled cheese sandwich which both my husband and I snacked on as well. We also ordered the passion fruit mojitos which were delicious. But I was still a little peeved so it was difficult to be happy. Until..... The cheesecake came! I ordered the new Salted Caramel and my husband ordered the Strawberry.  I don't know why they bother to serve anything else. The cheesecake was perfect, sweet, and creamy.

I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the server said it was more sweet then spicy,  I almost changed my order because I wanted it spicy but said she likes it spicy as well and has the cooks add more chili pepper flakes to it to bring up the heat. I asked her to have them prepare it that way as I wanted it spicy. My mom ordered the Garlic Noodles without chicken or shrimp. Food came out and my ""spicy"" Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp was anything but spicy...as in no heat whatsoever. Not to mention the small amount of chicken and shrimp in the dish, especially for a $18 dollar entrée. My moms Garlic Noodles were super bland with almost no garlic flavor to them. She had to have the server come back and load it up with parmesan cheese just to get any flavor on the dish.  We were pretty disappointed to say the least, especially for the price of the food.

Their veggie burger is made with brown rice, red peppers, onions, and some other ingredients that I've never experienced before in a veggie burger. It was different, filling, and so, so good. I highly recommend you give it a try. That night hubby and I decided on sitting outside, under the palm trees that light the walk-way at this location.

197,Linnette G.,"Oviedo, FL",66,20,15.0,4.0,2016-03-20,"My first visit here was so so. The cheesecakes are always on point, but choose menu items carefully or you'll end up with something you need to send back. Large parties are NOT accommodated for. There are no reservations. You have to stand there with your 10 plus party and wait. Half of them must be present prior to them even letting you check in. So pray that members arrive on time, or give them an earlier time to meet if you want to be seated by a specific hour. For a restaurant of this size and magnitude, that's kind of daunting, especially with the amount of tables available. We had cranky, then sleepy kids after the long wait, then finally getting seated, then finally getting the mediocre food. Upon my second (and third) visits, it was a more pleasurable experience. Second time three of us just met for cheesecake and I got a pasta something. It was delicious. For my third visit, it was just myself and a friend since she wanted to try the cheesecakes. The food tasted great on this occasion as well. Ambience is always on point, and I love how they dim the lights as it rolls into evening. Very smooth transition. I also ordered a specialty, sugar free cheesecake here for a friend's dad once. I asked for it about a week in advance, just in case. It was presented beautifully on the day I picked it up (Thanksgiving) and it was a hit with my friend as their dad appreciated the gesture! As far as cheesecake goes, they know their stuff! Service is good, especially for smaller parties. The food may be hit or miss, depending on your selection, albeit some items are slightly overpriced. They have SUCH a huge selection of food, though, that most anyone will find something they love. As for cheesecake, pay whatever they charge you! You get a hefty slice and it is DELICIOUS. Their ""to-go"" for cheesecake can be hit or miss though. I asked for two plain cheesecakes with no whipped cream as my boys don't like it and they brought them both with whipped cream.

I had the Caesar's salad w/chicken, which was good. My wife was full, so she gave me half her mushroom burger and some fries.

I love cheesecake factory but this location was absolutely awful. I placed a to go order because I was staying at a resort near this location in Orlando. I ordered the hibachi steak dinner which I frequently get it. My friend is the one who picked it up and brought it to me. She checked the food to make sure the steak was cooked at temperature with the person who put the meal together and everything looked good. Unfortunately my friend didn't know what was supposed to come with the meal and the prep person said nothing either. When it got to me the meal was missing the vegetable and the onions that are cooked with the steak which are my favorite part. It was literally just steak on a bed of beans sprouts in mashed potatoes. We were about 20 minutes from the location and also the restaurant had closed but I called the next morning and told him what happened this was Friday, January 13. A manager I spoke with took down my information and said they would give me a call back. I told him I just wanted my order made again and was still told I'd get a call back. Fast forward to Tuesday and I still have not heard back so I called again and at this point I'm back at home so I'm nowhere near this cheesecake factory I speak to a manager again and ask for them to just put it on a gift card or back on my card and I'm told someone will call me back so they can figure out what who handled my call initially it what went wrong (why I hadn't heard back). It is now Friday and I still haven't received a call back so now I've paid for food that wasn't made correctly and I am out of my money with no care from Cheesecake Factory.  I know this is not every location but this is this locations actions specifically.

To bolster that time suck they also have extremely limited seating to wait on.  The menu is the standard ""sweet jesus how can they possibly have so many options come from one kitchen??"" My go to is the parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes. I avoid looking at the black hole that is the menu here.  Cheesecake is an obvious win. The tuxedo is my personal fave and the black and white a close runner up.  Staff is inconsistent.

173,Margie L.,"Liberty, MO",0,5,,1.0,2017-02-25,I visited this location this past weekend for my daughter's birthday. Sadly this was the worst experience I've had by far in any of the Cheesecake factory locations I dined in. The night started with a receipt telling us to come back in an hour to get a pager. When we returned in an hour for the pager the front desk indicated to us we had no wait and we should've got a pager right away. We were seated after an hour and 45 minutes. We were first greeted by one server who apparently was having a very bad night then later by a different server. Finally we had a third person bringing us items. The food was incorrectly placed therefore delaying half of our meals coming later. The server did not apologize but rather give us attitude about the change which clearly was her fault. We asked for a manager he came over to apologize but there was no sincerity and the apology was clearly scripted. Finally after asking four times the servers gathered to sing happy birthday to my daughter. I received no discount for the inconvenience rather I received a bill that was double the amount and I had  to ask them to change it.  Change in management and servers is needed immediately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=180,3.04,3.33,3.62,2.6280000000000006,3.214
0,Christian J.,"Orlando, FL",48,55,70.0,3.0,2017-02-25,"So I went to Cheesecake Factory for me and my boyfriend's anniversary. The reason I did not give Cheesecake 4 or 5 stars is because I felt like the service was not GREAT. I'll start with the negatives.  The server I had that night really did not seem too invested in us, and it made me wonder if it was because we are both young, maybe she felt like we might not tip her as well? I'm not sure. But she seemed more invested in the tables around us. We sat with dirty plates for at least 10 minutes, as she helped tables around us. And when she brought the final receipt she said HERE YOU GO, and smiled and left. I'm thinking when you bring the check you should be very kind since they are about to tip you. Say THANK YOU FOR DINING WITH US TONIGHT, HAVE A GREAT NIGHT. Another thing that bothered me that as I walked out I walked past about 7 employees, 3 which were at the hostess desk, and NO ONE said have a good night. So even though the food was perfect, i wondered ARE OTHER LOCATIONS FRIENDLIER? Now to the positives! I got the chicken Madeira again, and it's great because it's pretty light it very satisfying and flavorful. My boyfriend got the same thing he got the first time he went, which I can't remember the name of the plate, but it hadc782123d-68e1-470d-8493-042632e23bee chicken and spaghetti I tomato sauce, and he specifically wanted to come to Cheesecake Factory to have this same plate again. We had drinks as well, and both my peach frozen drink and his pina colada were very tasted. We were so full that we had ZERO room for dessert. That's one great thing about this restaurant, is that you get your money's worth. Again, the food was wonderful, the service was just not anything to compliment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=40,3.12,3.32,3.616,2.8280000000000003,3.2400000000000007

The food: I knew coming in that every dish is supposed to be like 5,000 calories. So, I went head first and ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  It was actually very good with a huge quantity. It might have been a bit overpriced, but it's expected at a tourist restaurant.  I tried others' appetizers that included guacamole, calamari, and an avocado egg roll.  All were very tasty.  Too full to eat anything else, I took two orders of cheesecake home. I haven't tried them yet, but I was surprised how small they were.   The value:  It's all a bit over-priced for what it is, but again it seems to cater to tourists and birthday parties, so I can't knock it for that.   Again, 3.5 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando,3.08,3.32,3.608,2.8600000000000003,3.2240000000000006
51,Cecille R.,"Apopka, FL",537,960,3425.0,4.0,2017-03-10,"I kind of avoid The Cheesecake Factory like the plague. Especially this location. It's always waaaaaay too crowded and it's tourist central.  I hadn't been here in years so when a friend wanted to have her birthday dinner here, I was happy to oblige.  While the crowded(and claustrophobic) lobby situation is a hot mess , CF exceeded my expectations with their food and service by the awesome Symone! First up, just note that this place doesn't take reservations for after 5pm. So expect a wait during prime dining times. Since we had a large party I made a point to place our name on the list about 1/2 hr prior to when we wanted to dine. Also, you'll have to kind of push your way up to the hostess booth or you'll be standing there waiting forever.  We had a few CF newbies and everyone seemed to be pleasantly surprised by their experience. Symone took wonderful care of us- she was fun, personable and on top of things. The menu is definitely overwhelming so I recommend browsing prior to dining especially if you've never been. There are soooo many choices and they even have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu for those watching their food intake as well as many meatless options scattered throughout the menu.  Aside from the complimentary bread, we ordered a bunch of apps to share amongst the table. The avocado egg rolls were delicious and a standout in my eyes. I ordered the guac and chips to share. Don't underestimate this- it was a substantial portion, fresh and you can pick your heat level! My friend accidentally bit into the pepper that it came with and confirmed the heat level for us! lol     Unfortunately, I ate too much guac b/c by the time my entrée came out, I was a little stuffed. My fish and chips looked great and it also comes with cole slaw. The fish was perfectly battered and a golden color. Tartar sauce is also provided for dipping but the fish was also great on its own.   A few of my friends ordered the sliders and those seemed to be a hit. And apparently you HAVE to get a side of ranch sauce for dipping. It was the star condiment of the night! Anyways a visit here can't go without a slice of cheesecake. We each ordered a slice (or 2) to go and also snuck in a surprise bday singalong for the birthday girl!  While this is not a quick dining experience, it was an enjoyable one! I'll make sure not to cross CF off the list so quickly for dining out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=20,3.08,3.34,3.608,2.9600000000000004,3.2360000000000007

It was not what I would consider a positive experience.  They don't take reservations in the evening so our party requested a table at around 7 and were given an hour and a half wait. The buzzer went off in about that time and then we were told to stand in an awkward spot near the hostess station which is right in the way of people trying to run food. After standing there for about 5 minutes we were seated.  Our server was not particularly friendly or attentive. It took a long time to get all of our orders in. One order had a mistake in the side dishes and it took about 10 minutes for the correct side to come out. We ended up there until 10:00 by the time our checks were delivered.  On the positive side the food is quite good there. We shared some avocado egg rolls and loaded baked potato tots which were delicious. My order of chicken Bellagio was really good even though I took most of it to go. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. Unfortunately the extremely long wait times and lukewarm service do not make up for this fact.  On the bright side I was quite amused that the pillars inside look like the eye of Sauron haha.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=20,3.16,3.31,3.604,2.7600000000000007,3.25

We came here and they directed us to the takeout line. I don't understand why because we ordered for pickup. It was a little frustrating considering we had to be back at work fast. It took around 25-30 mins and we waited in line. It also felt like no AC was on and there was too many people. Finally a woman called our name and we got pass a few people and they rang us up for our phone order. The woman who rang us up was incredibly sweet and she made the experience better.  The cheesecake was delicous and I will be back to try other flavors.

This location always seems to be somewhat crazy since it is at the mall and it feels like there are people everywhere. We were seated fairly quickly and had our waiter Wagner check up on us when we sat down. He was very pleasant and explained the specials. The reason I love cheesecake is because they have so many different options on their menu and they give you generous portions. They have different types of food ranging from pasta, to Asian, to fried chicken, to small plates, and appetizers.  My favorite plate is the cashew chicken they offer. It is a very generous portion and has the perfect amount of spice. It comes with white rice and the sauce is sweet and spicy. Always my go to and ordered it tonight as well. We also ordered the avocado egg rolls and I'm a HUGE fan of the green sauce that comes with it. Never a let down. My gf ordered the pasta and she seems to always love it.  You can't leave without having a piece of cheesecake so I ordered the hazelnut crunch, which is fairly new, and my gf ordered ""old faithful"" which is the oreo cheesecake. The cheesecake is to die for and always a must have for me. Best dessert you can have after a delicious meal.

I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been going to other locations in FL and loved them all.. and then I came here.  Welcoming staff was nice, my fiancée and I had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and we were put in a pretty dark corner where the server had to ask a woman to move her purse, which seemed to make her very angry. Also, are non-service dogs allowed here? She had a small dog on the booth the entire time without a service vest? If I was allowed that I would've brought my dog too.... Our server came to us very quickly and gave us bread and butter immediately. He gave a time to look over the menu. We started with the loaded tot appetizer. I ordered the pineapple chicken and shrimp and my fiancée ordered the chicken and biscuits.  Our tots had a cream cheese plastic wrap inside one. The first one we tried. My fiancée took a big bite and pulled it out of his mouth!! I'm VERY glad we took that bite before any of the other ones.. hopefully the other ones they've been serving don't have them too unknowingly.... we brought this to the attention of our server and he told us it happened accidentally because the tots are all individually wrapped in plastic and they have to unwrap them each by hand .. but the plastic was INSIDE the tot.  Aside from that severe disappointment.. the entrees were ... okay. We waited what seemed like a very extensive time for the entrees to come out. My fiancées chicken and biscuits was fine. He asked for no mushrooms and they gladly did it for him. Only downside was the biscuits were cold! Waited near a half hour for cold biscuits.. :( I asked for my pineapple chicken and shrimp to have no cilantro ... and it definitely had cilantro still in it. And I can't stand the flavor of it. Aside from the bites with cilantro ... the entree itself was pretty satisfying.  Overall I was disappointed with my visit. It was an anniversary date for a year of being engaged and well.. I wish we went somewhere else. Unsure about how fresh everything is here (what's shipped and what's not, considering what the server told us about the plastic) but if they make them by hand..

40,Yerim P.,"Orlando, FL",8,23,11.0,4.0,2017-09-23,It's been years since I've visited Cheesecake Factory. My fiancée and I stumbled into Cheesecake Factory by Millenia because our original plans at a different restaurant didn't pan out.  First of all there was a 40 minute wait when we got there on a Saturday night. Cant say we were surprised- it was a Saturday night and when we called earlier they informed us they do not take reservations during the weekend. Totally understandable the wait and line were insane!!  When it was finally our turn though -- the food was outstanding! We ordered sweet corn tamale because of a recommendation from a friend. I didn't know what to expect and I'm not a huge fan of tamales myself but man oh man - it blew my mind! The flavors mesh so well together and the sauce is sooo good. TBH this could be an entree all on its own if you want it costs around $10-11?  Next we got our entree - we both ordered from the specialty menu of the night. I got the pasta napolenta and he got the carne asada medallion. Both were really good. My pasta consisted of 3 different meats and the sauce was so flavorful. The portion wasn't as big as their other plates but it was more than enough for me! I even took some home.  We finished our night off with tiramisu Cheesecake - absolutely life changing. It was.

The Spicy Cashew Chicken is most of the time prepared correctly, only a few rare times is it a little off. I only get the white rice, so can't say how the brown rice is. The sauce is amazing mixed the slightly fried chicken and the cashews. To me there's absolutely no spice, but it's too spicy for my SO. Another great thing is that it's large enough to have the next day! We always love coming to Cheesecake Factory for their good food. The atmosphere can be a bit loud and chaotic as this place is always busy. The cheesecakes are good too, just never enough room at the end to order them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando,3.12,3.2,3.4,,3.1680000000000006

Compared to the last Cheesecake Factory we visited, the service definitely was lacklustre, we had to request our bread a few times and it arrived pretty much as our dinner was arriving.  The Alfredo was a little underdone but still extremely tasty and the margarita pizza was pretty good!  As to be expected the cheesecakes were amazing, we took the original strawberry and the chocolate mousse cheesecake.

My friend had the California cheesesteak with fries which wasn't too bad only thing he didn't like was that the fries were over salted.

My family told the host and asked if it was possible to get a table a bit faster .. either outside or inside because we knew our dinner would be fast.  The manager came over and gave us menus. He told us to look over the dishes so when we were seated we could order right away. We got a table in 15mins and ordered right away!!

Our server then tried to charge me $3.95 for the drink that came with his kids meal. I pointed it out to her and she said,""I'll see if they will take it off.""  Wrong answer.

Sorry, but that's ridiculous that it takes you 20 minutes to take something out of the case in front of you and put it in a box.

Once I got there about 15 minutes later the wait was up to 45 minutes for 5. The table which we sat at had cheesecake all over the place. We asked for someone to clean it and our waitress handed us napkins. My utensil were dirty from the cheesecake. The small windows surrounding our table were covered with cheesecake, most likely a child did it, but it would be descent of them to clean it up. Bread was brought out but never replaced. Our server was good at refilling water though and the food came out at a good time, however everything came out at different times. I really enjoyed my Skinnylicious Shrimp Tacos, Im really glad they make a skinny menu since everything else is over 1,000 calories. I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake and it was very good.

Once seated, the server was quite helpful in making food choices. I had the vegan Cobb salad which was huge, delicious and satisfying. Older son ordered a chicken sandwich and hubby and younger son ordered burgers....the mushroom and Mac and cheese burgers. None of them could finish their meals.

It was so busy that we had to wait an hour for a table (we were told this when we put our names in and opted to wait).  The waiting area in the restaurant can get a little tight, especially today with there being cooler than normal temps outside. An hour passed and we were notified that our table was ready. We went to the hostess stand and were directed to stand over in another area and wait to be called. I don't understand why Cheesecake Factory does this as standing room is at a premium at the front of the restaurant. After about 5 minutes of additional waiting, we were led to our table.  Our server was very friendly and welcoming. She took our drink orders then gave us time to look over the expansive menu. I ended up ordering the Americana Cheeseburger and a side of fries. This burger is topped with American and Cheddar cheese, potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles and secret sauce. It was a very tasty burger! I ordered a slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake to go. This is Hershey's cheesecake between chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. This is a rich, decadent slice of heaven...if you're a chocolate fan, you need this cake! Overall this is a good restaurant. The parking lot is large (it's in a mall), but can be a challenge; however there is valet parking if you want to skip the lot (and it's right in front of the restaurant!). The staff are friendly, and the food is good. It can be pricey, but the portion sizes are huge.  Check it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando,3.4,3.21,3.372,,3.286

It's the only time there is not wait. I went here with my daughter after a day in the mall. We arrived right   before I think the lunch crowd started. It was roughly noon time. We waited about ten minutes before our beeper went off. By the time we went to our table, people were being told 35-40 minutes so we just made it. It is a beautifully decorated place but they seem to pack people in like sardines. No room what so ever from you are the next table. We were greeted by our waitress almost as soon as we sat down. The menu is beyond HUGE! Way to many items to prepare the way they should in my mind. We both went with the mushroom burger the had smoked gouda cheese on  it. The gouda cheese gave it a great taste. I have to say it made the burger. And it was cooked perfectly. As we were waiting we were treated to some good fresh bread. Our waitress as nice as she was, was spread entirely to thin with tables. We never got refills on our drinks which was only water until we got our check. Definitely something any waitress or waiter needs to pay attention to is empty glasses. We split the chocolate cake - coconut cheesecake the was beyond amazing. The other not good situation here is that the restrooms do not have enough stales in them. The ladies only have 3 stales and usually the line is out the door. I know we will be back even it's only for the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando,3.4,3.2,3.372,,3.2800000000000007
