186,Dani C.,"Gilbert, AZ",209,233,65.0,3.0,2012-04-29,"The cheesecake is definitely the best part of this place. The food is average fare, and there are so many things to choose from it's a bit overwhelming. VERY over-priced too. Had to laugh at their new ""skinylicious"" menu. I mean, it's good they have one, but it still made me giggle. Who goes to Cheesecake Factory to watch their calorie intake?  I had a pomegranate mojito that was wonderful. The steak and salmon combo was also good, but they give you a half-gallon tub of mashed potatoes and three- yes THREE- asparagus spears. What's wrong with that picture?  Our waitress Samantha, however, was awesome! So if you get her you'll have a great time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=180,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

The food came out fast and it was good!   Now, the bar area is very inviting, roomy and open.  They have a happy hour special Mon-Fri from 4-6pm.  2.50 drafts, but they only had two to choose from.  Decent wine menu and HH special on some wines at 4 bucks.  The only downside to this location is it is very hard to get there.  It is in a weird location at the Superstition Mall.  Other than that we can't wait to go back and try the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=100,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8640000000000003,3.4000000000000004

92,Peggy T.,"Apache Junction, AZ",58,52,10.0,3.0,2012-06-18,"My husband and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory the other day and were pleasantly surprised.  The menu offered a huge selection of food including a separate menu of just calorie conscious meals.  They also had a full bar, which was a nice surprise as well. We were greeted at the door by a gal that ended up being our waitress.  She was great and upon hearing that we'd never been there before, she went through the menu, which is more like a book, and gave us a brief summary of what was available and where to find it. I ordered the Chop Salad off of the low calorie menu and also a low cal mojito.  The mojito was delicious, but also cost $9.50, not sure it was worth that.  The Chop Salad wasn't bad, but not something I'd go back for.  My husband's meal was about the same, average. The seating was nice, waitress was great, menu was huge, and the meal was average.

83,Raffi M.,"Gilbert, AZ",8,108,86.0,5.0,2012-08-23,"Cheesecake Factory always exceeds expectations! We have always had attentive, accommodating, and friendly wait staff. Their menu is endless which allows you to always come back and try something new (it is hard though because you always want to order the amazing entree you got last time). Most recently our visit included several dishes. To start we got the Chicken Pot Stickers as an appetizer. The sauce was wonderful, the chicken was flavorful and moist, and I only wish they served 6 pieces instead of 5 so we could have shared them more easily. Among the appetizers we have tried in the past, the Stuffed Mushrooms are a must, Fried Zucchini is great, and the Ahi Tartare is decent (a little small on the portion size). We have also tried the Vietnamese Tacos. The spices and seasonings were perfect, but the bread-to-meat ratio was a little more on the bread side, but the flavor still did not disappoint. Among our entrees, the one that stood out on our most recent visit was the Hibachi Steak. Wow, honestly when we go back it will be hard for me to get anything else. I thought the steak might be whole, but it was chopped and cooked with a hibachi type sauce (sweet and savory). The meat was not dried out, not fatty, and oh-so tasty. The wasabi mashed potatoes were amazing; they weren't too creamy, and the wasabi taste was not overwhelming and complemented everything else nicely. The two pieces of tempura asparagus served on top were cooked to perfection. The tempura batter was light, tasted perfect, and they had a crisp texture and the asparagus was not over or under cooked on the inside. Definitely one of my favorite meals here. I always order a side of plantains when I come here. I first experienced these when I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp (which is soooo good with the mango salsa, black beans, and seasonings). Ever since that dish I make sure to get some plantains with our meal. Among the entrees, from what I can remember, we have tried, and loved a couple of the burgers, the Southeast Asian Caramel Chicken, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp, Pasta Carbonara, Simple Grilled Chicken, a side of Sweet Potato Fries (anything sweet potato is great), and much more. Everything is made fresh, and they can alter the dishes upon request. If you have an allergy or concern with ingredients, just ask! They can do many substitutions and are able to cook the food differently if you require. Oh my the cheesecakes!!! Pumpkin, Peppermint (both are special editions, but probably the best), Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple, Dulce De Leche Caramel, Kahlua Cocoa Coffee, Pineapple Upside-Down (amazing), Pina Colada, Mango Key Lime, and the new Oreo Dream Extreme (very chocolaty).  I haven't ordered all of these myself, but over the years I have at least tried these (whether it is me or someone I am with who has ordered them), and they are all amazing. Wouldn't recommend to indulge all the time, but for special occasions once or twice a year... go for it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=160,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.0280000000000005,3.3200000000000003

Chicken Pot Stickers, Chicken Sliders and the Fried Calamari. So here's what I thought I wasn't Impressed Nor Disappointed. The Pot Stickers had good flavor but were a little salty the Fried Calamari was good could have been cooked a little longer and the Chicken Sliders were good not a lot of flavor thou.

One small negative -- prices are high here.  Maybe because of the property's operating costs.  My friend's salad was $12 and my burger was $12 and the side of salad was an additional $3.  Drinks (iced tea) were extra too.  So my lunch was close to $20 -- that is high for lunch.  There are so many places where I can get a big, nice lunch with a drink for under ten bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=140,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.9240000000000004,3.1200000000000006

It was a Friday night and we were obviously expecting a longer wait because we didn't make reservations. There were probably fifty people outside waiting, so we just decided to stick it out.  Five minutes later, we get buzzed in. The host who had been very rude and bitchy for lack of a better word, hadn't bothered to ask how many people were in our party, and assumed two. Um, no, it was four. They dealt with their mistake by bumping us right into a table, past all those who had been waiting much longer. Of course, everyone was upset.  The service isn't memorable, even a week later. We were seated on the outside patio, which was warm in the 50 degree weather and rain outside. The food didn't live up to any hype most people give it. The other people in my family liked theirs, but it just wasn't special. Also, the people next to us ordered a lot of seafood, so I was forced to smell that awful aroma the whole night.

I can only speak about the jambalaya and I was a little disappointed. I had asked our server if the jambalaya came with spinach pasta and she said yes. Well, it comes with a tiny bit of it, and the rest is regular pasta. I would have liked to know that since I specifically asked about it. Then, I have had jambalaya here other times and I thought this time there seemed to be no sauce at all, the noodles were not very tasty, server offered to bring extra sauce and it was very runny. The only awesome thing is that I had asked for extra vegetables, specifically artichoke, and the artichoke hearts were really good.

I ordered the kids mini burgers & FF for my lil girl & from the lite menu, the chix salad sand,w/ a small salad for myself. Our server was just ok. Took about 20 mins to get our food. I had 2 bites of my salad, which was ok, bunch of nice greens, 1 tomato wedge & 1 thin slice of cucumber, Then I took 1 bite of my sandwich, that looked nice & I bit into something sharp & hard, shocked me, I just spit it out, when I look it was a piece of wood from 1 of those large toothpicks they put in sandwiches, I pulled out the 1 in the half I picked up, well I guess the kitchen had put 1 in before which broke & they didnt remove all of it, a piece about 1 1/4 inch, I was so upset.

Wrong.  I instantly recognize my new found luck, take the spot  and mutter to myself that this already added a star to my review. (Horrible criteria). I know.  I quickly walk up to the entrance and attempt to open this 72 foot door for my mother like this castle entrance had no match for her strong growing boy. Long story short, I'm going to blame the automatic hydraulics on the door because it didn't play out in my head as I imagined. It was more of a yank that pulled me in close to the door that may had looked like I caressed the inner panel and humped the outskirts of the door that turned into a side shuffle on the way in.  Rest assured nobody was watching. I continue on and smile at my mother while opening the door and I quietly tell her I opened the door for her because people are watching. (She knows I'm kidding.)  We walk inside and I scan around to see if anybody might had seen my extravaganza with the front door. I'm quickly reminded that the world does not revolve around me and nobody cares.  I look over and see my brother already has a pager. He wastes no time. Hostess grabs menus and I follow her down part of the isle only to find my family walking the opposite direction. My brother looks over at me across the way and I give him the ""I can't believe we're related"" look because they're obviously heading the wrong way. I turn around soon realizing I'm approaching the table with the wrong family and I followed the wrong hostess. I make way to my correct gene pool and sit with them. They're notified I was just getting my surroundings and looking for the bathroom. I pick up the menu and start reading. Servers continue to scurry to their tables around us. I eye every one of them as I am actively involved in the sport of people watching. I notice they are all wearing white. White shirts. White pants. White shoes.  I look over at the walls to check for padding thinking maybe I'm actually in an insane asylum and this is my happy place I have made for myself with a 476 item menu and endless cheesecake. I don't question much further. If the shoe fits, wear it.  Our waitress approaches our table. She's all smiles which turns my ugly mug of 12 hours dealing with society around instantly. We order drinks. I ask for lemonade. She then asks if I would like peach, strawberry or raspberry lemonade. I give her a blank stare. I realize this actually is the happy place I have created for myself and I order strawberry leaning against my padded cell. I then order a chicken ceasar salad with an extra side of ceasar. (Boring I know) but I refused to read the novel of items on the menu and resorted to my brain picking up on what seemed like the first acknowledged words out of a 4 page crossword puzzle.  I continue to look around the place while waiting making awkward eye contact with random people throughout the restaurant. Our food quickly arrives. My ceasar salad engulfs 67% of the table as she sets it down. I use no manners and began eating before she can ask if we need anything else.  Grabbed my glass of strawberry lemonade and continued to make awkward eye contact with strangers.  I finished half way through my ceasar then raised my flag in utter failure.  If you're questioning the service, I think my drink was refilled 13 times past halfway point until I resembled violet from Willy Wonka. I knew the Oompa Loompas would be there shortly to roll me out. I did not like the ceasar dressing whatsoever. It taste of spicy seafood for some odd reason. I am not going to bash on the review because of this as our waitress filled the void and to judge such a restaurant on ""my"" opinion of the entire restaurant based solely on ceasar dressing would be just shy of moronic and I would deserve to choke on a crouton. Besides, my family loves this place.  A slice of strawberry cheesecake landed in front of me after dinner. I vaguely remember discussing it with the waitress as it was late and I was overtired. I think she just came over smiling again and had a desert menu and I mumbled ""strawberries"" trying to avoid drooling on myself and she filled in the blank. Well she was dead on.  Can I say this in a review? That sh%# was good. ""The Cheesecake Factory"" weird, i know. Though it took longer than normal for my taste buds and brain to work intuitively together by this hour, I  still thoroughly enjoyed it.  We got up to leave once I finished. Oompa's nowhere to be found to assist me in getting through the door never mind opening it this time. (Flaky little bast%#{^) Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I didn't have far to crawl back to my car. I can say i will patronize this place again with a different menu item in mind. Service was great. Thanks again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=160,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.732,3.0800000000000005

196,Moll C.,"Mesa, AZ",1,11,1.0,2.0,2014-11-02,"My daughter and I used to eat here often. There are so many choices, and even though it can be expensive for us, it was so good that it was worth it. For the last several months, however, this location has been getting worse and worse. We often go fairly late. We try to come no later than an hour before closing, because the staff get very prickly, and sometimes very rude. To me, if you're open until ten, you need to be open until ten. If I come in at nine, you shouldn't treat me like I'm a jerk for it. We've had staff give us the silent treatment, and have even had one be pretty rude. We don't get bread about 80% of the time, and I think it may be a passive-aggressive move. Does that sound paranoid? Evs. This place really needs a staff meeting. The service is bad, but the food is the real issue at this location. My daughter always gets the four cheese pasta. The last three times it has been weird. Once she only got half the amount as usual, and the other two times it was super liquidy with barely any pasta. I ordered a well-done hamburger that came out almost raw. That is the only time in my life that I've sent a food back. I always order a hamburger well-done when I'm out, but I am willing to eat it if it's at least above medium. I could not even think about eating that burger. The manager came out and apologized and assured me that it wasn't cooked enough (oh, gee, I'm happy I wasn't making that up...), but she offered no kind of discount. So I just got to wait half an hour longer (not exaggerating) for what had already taken half an hour to get in the first place. There are other issues as well; chicken sandwiches with fatty, gristly filets, salads with iffy to rotten lettuce, reluctance to provide enough ketchup or tartar sauce. This place used to have standards, but now it's not even as clean as it used to be. I'm going to miss you, Cheesecake Factory.

Very disrespectful and when does a bartender know more than anything. The manager is horrible and very condescending. Don't go! Ok so just checked no law, but the bartender was uncomfortable; however, she never spoke to me or gave me a sobriety test to see if I was even intoxicated. My husband and I were having a discussion about the NFL draft. How can a bartender ascertain a person's alcohol level without actually talking to the person. Horrible customer service.  Just because you had a problem in the past with that bartender does that mean everyone needs to be punished. Not a good way to run a business that relies on customer service and repeat business.

Our party arrived around 5:30, but was seated immediately, a shock considering the Saturday night crowd was arriving! The hostess who brought us to our table was one of the most chatty hostesses I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She asked me about my day, and appeared genuinely concerned with the guest experience, handing the menus to each person individually, a very nice touch.  Unfortunately, it took quite a bit longer to see our waitress than I would have expected! Drinks took quite a while to arrive, but I was expecting this, given the size of the joint and the fact that most of our drinks came from the bar. After the waitress returned, I decided to order the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo, which came out of the kitchen not too much later. The gumbo was packed with flavor, though I was let down on how spicy it was. The texture was also fairly poor - it seemed almost mucous-like. Fortunately, I was able to end the night with Oreo Cheesecake, not the Linda's Fudge Cake I had thought I would order. I couldn't have been happier with the choice to order cheesecake, it didn't have that rich, over-powering chocolate that Linda's Fudge Cake has.

I walked in the front door and finally saw them waving at me from a booth way in the back, by the washroom.  As I made my way over to them, I saw there were all kinds of empty tables, far away from the washroom.  My friends told me the hostess informed them it would be at least a half hour wait for an outside table but she'd give them a nice table inside.  Nice?  A dark booth by the washroom door!  Nice?  I went back to the hostess and explained to her I had just come in from dropping my friends off and she immediately pointed and said ""Oh, I just seated them over there"".  I answered that I knew that and asked why we couldn't sit outside when there were so many empty tables and she said there were only two servers outside.  I said we wouldn't mind waiting outside at a table for the half hour until a server could wait on us. I told her we had come especially to sit outside and that furthermore, if we did have to dine inside, I was not prepared to sit in a dark cramped booth, way in the back by the washroom when there were plenty of other desirable empty tables.  She began giving  me some kind of idiotic reason why she couldn't do that and made some remark about getting the manager for me to talk to.  I told her her not to bother, we'd go someplace else where we could dine outside.  I went back (by the washroom) to inform my friends we were leaving and just then a really nice waiter, Tony P., whose table they were sitting at, came and told us he would take use out to the patio and serve us out there, even though it wasn't in his station.  We agreed and from then on, the evening was perfect.   Tony P. was pleasant, attentive and courtious and we didn't have to wait long at all to be served.  As usual, the food and wine were excellent.  So, what began as my first bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory due to an indifferent hostess, ended with my friends and I having a delightful dinner, thanks to our server, Tony P.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=140,3.76,3.55,3.55,3.248,3.634

However this was the ice cream on the cheesecake. We (a party of 6) arrived on the Saturday before Easter Sunday at around 6:00 and of course, it was busy. We figured that and were told it would be about a 40 minute wait. Fine and dandy we got a buzzer and waited outside. 40 minutes comes and goes and we haven't been called. After about 50-60 minutes I went inside and asked where we were in line and was told we were the next ""smallest large party to be seated,"" whatever that means. I went outside and we waited another 5-10 minutes and still nothing. Finally we all went inside and stool in front of the waiters podium and asked what was going on.  Now, you have to understand that we had a young woman in our party who had been a severe car accident only a few months ago and had broken both ankles. She was able to walk, albite shakily and slowly. So she's hurting, we are all hungry, and we have all been waiting for about 1.25 hours.  We finally get seated, after watching several other parties as large or larger than ours get seated. Our waitress was very friendly and brought us our drinks and took our orders very quickly. However we did not see her again. There was a party seated at the table next to us who was seated, got their drinks, got a basket of bread, and we were still waiting. I spoke with the manager on duty that night and he sent 3 other waiters & waitress to help us. Still, our waitress did finally show up again... And kept throwing dirty looks at us. Eventually we received our food. Some of our orders were cold. The only consolation was afterwards we bought cheesecake and it was delicious.  The Cheesecake Factory has been satisfactory.

Then I had to pay for the meal even though it was covered in cheese each and every single time.

We were surprised to see that the place was pretty full on a week day when we walked in.  Our server handed us the menus and asked us for our drink orders and she was nice to ask if we'd like to place the kids orders ahead of our meals which we did.  It took us a little while to go over the menu particularly me coz this was my first time here (I've been to the Dubai branch when I lived there and tried the Charlotte branch once 3 years ago but had to go over the menu again since it's pretty long and thought they must have some new items on there since the last time I was there). The first thing that I remembered when I looked at the menu was that the prices were kinda high. Even a pasta dish was at least $15 which we thought was a little too much. Nevertheless we decided to order appetizers and main dishes for everyone. Since I'm currently on a dairy-free egg-free diet, I asked for the allergy menu and they said they didn't have one. This to me was a negative because for such a big restaurant, if u don't want to have a separate allergen menu, you should at least identify allergens in ur main menu, right? Gluten, dairy, egg & nut allergies are becoming increasingly common and therefore this needs to be addressed. The waitress however said she would help me remove dairy items for my order (mind you she mentioned that ""most dishes have dairy in them however"". Any way to be on the safe side I decided to go for the old fashion burger. My husband ordered the mushroom burger and we ordered guacamole for appetizers. My sister in law and her husband decided to share a salad & the spicy chipotle chicken pasta with fried cheese as an appetizer.  The appetizers took a while to come out so when the mains came, we were not done with our apps yet. No problem, we decided to dig in.  My burger was very plain. Nothing special to be honest, I've had much better burgers in much cheaper restaurants around town. This feedback was also my husband's on his mushroom burger; "" nothing special"". My sister in law said their food was good, also nothing impressive.  During our dinner, the server came to ask us if we needed any thing and she filled our water cups. She also asked us if we wanted a box for our guac since we didn't finish it and we said yes. Overall her service was pretty good.  An underwhelming experience for both families yest.

56,Gary S.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,77,11.0,2.0,2016-12-29,"After about a 20 minute wait I'll start with the positive.  The kids meal is terrific.  Lots of variety as opposed to typical low end Mac n cheese corn dog kids menus.   Yes they had that but my kids got a terrific pizza, grilled salmon with tender carrots and mashed potatoes.  We also got chicken strips (real meat) with two sauces and nice mixed berry and pineapple. At the end we ordered strawberry cheesecake.  Terrific and plenty of whipped cream for the kids.   Ok so adults:   We got the jambalaya, which was decent but not real flavorful and we'd never get it again.  We also ordered French onion soup.  It looked like they opened a can of Campbell's and dumped it in a bowl with croutons and shredded cheeses.  Our server was Elizabeth.  She had other people deliver the food and did not check on us during our meal, in which I decided to forego my soup.  We hailed her 3-4 times with busboys and other waitstaff asking for utensils, straws, and water (you know basic items that should be on a table).   We started busing our plates by stacking them and after asking a busboy for water, he disappeared for 5 minutes and then Elizabeth showed up.  I asked her to return the soup.  She said no problem.  This was her standard response to any request, which I thought was odd because I didn't consider our requests to be problems in the first place, so I didn't need reassurance that it wasn't a problem.  At one point a young man who looked like a manager walked by and stood next to me.  He was very concerned about a 16 top that was getting set up.  Although I yelled excuse me three times at him, he ignored me and walked away.   I wanted to ask him why the waitress would simply take away my rejected soup without asking what was wrong with it or offering another option.  SOP So back to Elizabeth. She very enthusiastically asked us if we'd like the cheesecake menu.  We ended with the slice of cheesecake.  Walking out I searched for a manager again but he was nowhere to be found.  I imagine I was the tipping point for him most likely having heard multiple complaints that night and he escaped.   So like I said avoid this place for just about anything. Unless you simply want a quick cheesecake fix.  Thank you guest services for the reply.

She said ok and that she would be right back. Then proceed to ask our waitress what I ordered and the waitress said, ""I swore she ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and not the pasta"". Normally a waitress, would read back what we order to make sure it was correct. She didn't and said she probably misheard me. They brought out the pasta only to realize that the noodles are under cooked because they most likely rushed due to the fact that the waitress messed up my order. I'm disappointed.

This is very disappointing that a waitress stated this and did not say it in a nice manner but in a disgusted tone. Sorry Cheesecake Factory you should have more polite waitresses.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=40,3.2,3.51,3.51,2.8520000000000003,3.386
21,Brian A.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",91,11,21.0,1.0,2017-07-31,"Fun fact: Cheesecake Factory hates handicapped and disabled people. True story. Disrespectful and rude. Don't normally post negative reviews, but this was ridiculous. I just had disc surgery in my neck, which means traveling to Cheesecake Factory is out of the question. My sweet cousin offered to go pick up cheesecake as a pick-me-up, so I called, ordered, and told them I wouldn't be able to pick it up myself. The young lady at Cheesecake Factory said that it was fine and she gave me the discount and price at 12$ over the phone; being grateful, I thanked her. When my cousin arrived, she was told to go wait, which she did, the bagged cheesecake just sat on the counter as other people came in and placed orders. As she asked again to pick up the order, the young lady (maybe a different person) asked where the other people were for the discount, and she told her I called in and was the one who had the surgery. The manager comes over and removes the discount without consideration of circumstances. Clearly loyalty to your restaurant doesn't matter. Clearly your employees words don't mean anything. It was literally not something that needed issue, yet the manager felt being a jerk about a policy, I know for a fact they've made plenty of exception before, was necessary tonight. Wrong.

119,Virginia W.,"Mesa, AZ",0,5,,2.0,2017-08-17,"I usually go the Chandler location. So I am judging this one based on my experiences at the Chandler location. We came to this one, since we were in the area for dr. appointments.  Our server was fine. Drinks and appetizer came quick and were fine. When our meals came was when the problems started. Our server did not bring them. Some random person dropped them off and left. Mom had the dinner sized meatloaf and it was good and a very large portion of meat, potatoes, and veg. Mine was not so good. I had the chicken lettuce wraps. The lettuce was not butter lettuce, but a type of leaf lettuce. The amount of each topping was barely there. A small spoonful of each veg and the noodles. I am used to getting 2-3 times more of each topping. I wanted to complain, but it took our server 10-15 minutes to come check on us after we received our food. I told her the problems, but she did not seem to care. I had not touched it. So we just said to pack it up. She mixed everything together from my wraps and did not include the cabbage that held the toppings, to keep things separate. She put Mom's large dinner in a regular container and piled everything on top of each other. Thank goodness Mom does not mind her food mixed(corn in the potatoes, etc). Then the server put the side of gravy in a to go box and not a lidded container, We had to be careful it did not spill. We ordered cheesecake to go . She brought everything in separate bags. so instead of having one large to go bag we had 4 small bags. Very bulky and not easy to handle. The server was nice enough, just inexperienced. They need to train them better. We never saw a manager, so I could not talk with them. We expected the same quality and quantity of food at the location, that we get at Chandler. We did not receive that. So we will not be coming back to this location. They do not care if you like the food or have a problem. They just want your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa?start=60,3.16,3.52,3.52,3.1120000000000005,3.376000000000001

9,Paul H.,"Mesa, AZ",3,141,,2.0,2017-09-24,"I dined at this establishment located in the Superstition Springs Mall (with access from the parking lot) with six other family members yesterday. This location looks very nice, both inside and out. It was very loud since it was so crowded (there was a short wait at 5:00pm on a Sat) and dimly lit. I thought the lighting wasn't enough but I know they have marketing information that probably tells them people sit/stay longer and spend more $ when there is ""warm lighting"". I ordered the fish and chips and was very disappointed! It was $17.95 and the pieces of fish that were served were very small and too heavily breaded. One of my daughters liked her meal (some type of pasta) but the daughter that ordered the fried shrimp entree didn't like her meal either. She said the coating on the shrimp coupled with the large size of the pieces made it taste different than other fried shrimp she's had at other restaurants. The wife had grilled salmon and liked it, my aunt had a Cajun type pasta and she liked hers as well. My son had the bacon  burger and liked it (hard to mess up a burger). Several of us had different types of cheesecake and we liked the cheesecake a lot! Our service was very good.  I like The Cheesecake Factory enough that I would come back but I would definitely not order anything fried in the future. For the five people I paid for (4 of which had cheesecake), it cost me $158!

I bragged about this place after my last experience of great food and service. But unfortunately, you won't get a good rating from me this time! First I'd like to say our server, Rachelle D. was good, but that's all that was good on our visit!! Food was horrible I asked for hot wings, asked if I can get all flats, they stated they come pre-packed so it's mixed even. I get them and I get almost all drums, which I hate, and 3 flats, so I decide to eat them anyway because I was starving. The taste/ flavor was not good at all, you couldn't taste any spice or flavor, because all you can taste is the ""overload of salt"" on them and they appeared to be burned under the sauce. So after one bite I sent them back and got the pot stickers like my daughter got and they weren't too impressive either, I ate only two! Then the spinach dip with chips and ""salsa"" came and that was gross, very oily and stale chips and the ""salsa"" was in fact ""pico"" which is NOT salsa! When manager came over because I sent wings back I got, ""oh I am sorry and took them off bill"" and when I mentioned the ""salsa"" being pico, she states, ""oh, that's our salsa that's how we make it, it's not really spicy"" so I said it's not really salsa either that's pico!

Last night, however, I had to check to make sure we weren't actually in an Applebees. The food was awful! There were 8 people in our party and not one of us finished our meal. It's like they suddenly decided to start using the lowest quality ingredients possible while also jacking up the prices ($15 for a Cobb salad that contained what seemed like old, bagged lettuce and chewy chicken??). We mentioned it to the server and she responded by saying they've made some recent menu changes and are making some of the dishes differently. I take that to mean they're trying to bolster their bottom line by buying crappy quality food and dimming the lights a little more in hopes you won't notice!  We tried to save the meal by ordering some cheesecake but even the quality of that has gone down! A tiny slice of Oreo cheesecake was mostly huge chunks of Oreos and a few dabs of cheesecake mixed in. Thought maybe they were having an off night but heard tables on either side of us complaining as well; one couple said this is the third time they've noticed the poor quality of the food and would not be returning.

I didn't understand why we were sat there when there were other areas of the restaurant that were obviously not as busy. Our meal came out before the appetizer, which was cold by the time it reached our table. It didn't taste good and we did not eat it but they still charged us for it, even though we told our server it wasn't good. She was obviously too busy when she couldn't even process what we were telling her. The area was loud and she had way too many people to take care of.

As Shonda Rhimes once said, ""Cheesecake will always taste like love"". There are so many varieties of cheesecake, so little time. Each piece is ginormous.  The food menu is boring. On this recent visit,  I had a veggie omelet with country potatoes. I asked fo no onions in the omelet. One could reasonably infer that I would want to know if my potatoes were mostly onion, and less potato. Alas, I picked out onions for a good 5 minutes. The meal was relatively bland. I asked for salsa, and the server recommended the tomatillo salsa, which she said had a kick. Perfect. It needed a kick,  because it sure didn't have one.  It was like blended onions with cilantro. Clearly my favorite, as you have read. I couldn't even taste the tomatillo, and it needed salt. My hot chocolate, however, was tops. Chocolate and whipped cream can never really NOT be good, can it? My husband had the lemon ricotta pancakes, with a side of bacon. He really enjoyed both. However, you really did need to use the syrup on the pancakes, because they were not at all sweet.

The food at this location was just average. To be honest, however, we arrived 15 minutes before they closed on a Thursday night and the servers we more concerned with cleaning the restaurant rather than working another table. On the other hand, if you stay open you should treat every group the same regardless of the time they arrive. We've ordered the same dishes at other locations and been more satisfied- and had much better service - something this chain normally hangs their hat on.    A few examples: *The bread: normally there's two kinds. Meanwhile, because it was late (we assume) they only brought the baguette, not the wheat. And, the baguette was hard, not fresh like we come here for. This bread is something we (and many others) come here for.  *Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta: Had little to no flavor and the chicken wasn't flavorful and tender, which is normally is (I've ordered this dish a half-dozen times).  *Flatbread: This flatbread was average, at best.  *Spicy Cashew Chicken: hit the spot, this one tasted like it always does!  Let's be real. The Cheesecake Factory normally dishes out better than average food, great service and a fun experience that suits large parties, those on a date or families.

1,Taylor G.,"Mesa, AZ",72,104,34.0,2.0,2018-01-06,"This review is solely based on the experience I had today at this restaurant. I will break it down by service, food, overall price per person for the experience given. Décor: If you've never been inside a Cheesecake Factory, it will be a visual overload. Firstly, it will be packed of kids and adults alike, sitting around waiting for tables. They have a big fridge/cheesecake display case to start getting you hooked onto buying a $8-dollar slice of small cheesecake. This is come to play later... Food: Sadly, this is where things went wrong for me. I order the Cuban Sandwich, that usually comes with ""Pulled Pork"", which sadly looked like an old pork chop that was slapped onto the bread. Sliced deli ham, swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, on a toasted roll. I got something close to this, but also a giant black hair in my food. They apologized, and gave me a salad while the rest of my party ate. I got a new one fast, but it looked like it was rushed. The sandwich could've been made by my daughter, and would've looked nicer. I was shocked, and only ate part of the first half, and left the rest. The cheesecake slices have taken a HUGE dive in size. You pay roughly $8 dollars a piece of a slice of cheesecake. It has become a little overpriced.  Service: So, our first server Cole, was amazing. He was attentive, funny, and tried to connect with us on a quick, professional level. He sadly had a shift change, and our server Jessica was great. What I don't understand is, if you find hair in your food, you would want to comp the meal. I shouldn't have had to pay to wait for another version of my food because someone doesn't keep sanitary practices in the kitchen. The manager did apologize, but for me, I find it highly disappointing that they still charged me for this.  Overall: Due to this experience, I don't think I will return to Cheesecake Factory. I think there is some coaching moments that need to happen between the kitchen staff, and management. As a consumer, they should've taken that meal off the check, or at least offer to pay for dessert. A $3.00-dollar salad doesn't compensate a $15-dollar meal. I would love to speak more to someone from the restaurant or corporate, but I doubt it will happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mesa,3.64,3.48,3.48,,3.5440000000000005
