Emily F.,"Waltham, MA",4,225,9,2.0,5/14/2010,"Don't go. That's all I can say. We turned back both of our ""healthy"" meals because the green side was totally raw and rotten (I'm trying to post a picture).  The meal was truly awful, I was pretty sick after. the only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the waiter/manager/chef (seriously???) replaced our orders and gave us a food discount... food was still gross and i still paid too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Adam G.,"Malden, MA",89,192,165,2.0,11/12/2012,"Crapplebee's. That's all I have to say. While my new apartment is within a stone's throw from this location I will say I would rather throw stones at this restaraunt than eat here. The service while very friendly was unacceptably slow, especially when you consider this is a chain restaurant. When the food came, I was glad to eat but unimpressed with my burger which was slightly dry as were the onion rings. Not to be political, but since the CEO of this Chain is one of the ""I'm going to lay off people because of Obamacare"" crybabies, I am proud to boycott this restaurant. I'm sure they are laying off people because people hate Applebee's. "" That place was hell, it was like Applebee's with a bar! Oh wait, Applebee's has a bar. It's like Applebee's..."" -Roger Smith, American Dad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Thomas B.,"Fall River, MA",0,16,,1.0,1/16/2013,"I ate at a different Applebee's before and had a good experience.  However, even though It was not very busy, the service was slow, forgetful, and did not bring the correct order. My wife barely touched her food because it was cold and not very tasty she said, I had the riblets they were okay but nothing to write home about. The waitress kept on coming by and apologize for what ever went wrong. When it came to checking out, she gave me the wrong check it was approximately $50 too much. When I pointed this out to her, she apologized and then brought me the correct check. We are very easy to please, we just asked for hot food and friendly service. However we will not return to this Applebee's.. Maybe we went on the wrong night, or it was just an off night. It was not very busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Mei C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/5/2013,"I love Applebee's. But not this one.  The night we were there they were not even busy. yet we've waited forever to see our server for the first time. She was leaning on the table next to us instead of standing close to us to write down our order attentively. I ordered the 2 for $20 with chicken strips, she didn't ask me the sauce and when the food was here she gave me a sauce I normally won't order. I am fine with that but then I never get to see her until we're almost done with our food. My water empty and our waitress was busy chatting with the table behind us, didn't even bother to ask us if everything was okay. The only time we get to see her without waiting forever was when we pay the bill. Oh and the food - We have spinach and artichoke dip for appetizer but the chips are very greasy. The dip is decent though. For my chicken strips with fries, they put so many salt on the fries it's inedible. As we walk out we saw our server chatting with her colleagues at the entrance, I don't know about others but I'd assume she had been busy socializing with her colleagues than taking care of her tables. I would not come back to this one. The only reason for 2 stars is the delicious brownie bite. It was probably warmed with microwave but it's so good with the vanilla ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Mickey M.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",247,677,43,3.0,3/1/2009,"It's not bad for a random night to meet folks. I've never seen this place packed, but it's busy enough, They have several booths big enough to fit 6-8 people, so that's why I'd go here once in a great while. The bar isn't bad either, if you're on your way somewhere else or just need a quick bite to eat and want some sports to watch in a relatively quiet area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
David B.,"Medford, MA",39,49,3,4.0,8/15/2013,"Pretty good. Compared to other Applebee's the service was solid, prices were obviously good and the food was pretty ok . The dessert we got was outstanding (chocolate meltdown). Lets face it, not looking for anything special when coming here but I was pleasantly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Alexis J.,"Medford, MA",65,212,10,4.0,4/9/2013,This Applebee's is MUCH better than it's neighbor in nearby Dorchester. We've been there a couple times and the food and service have always been pretty good. Our last waitress (J'nai I think) was fantastic. Super friendly and attentive. We now always drive to this location because it's not terrible (but not great either).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Samantha H.,"Malden, MA",1,47,3,1.0,5/12/2011,"Crapplebees!  I rather eat a frozen dinner! (i.e Smart ones, lean cuisine etc...) Only thing that isn't bad are the drinks! But I will not go out of my way to go here even though it is 2 minutes from my house. So many other better restaurants around!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Cayndie C.,"Lakeland, FL",0,49,20,1.0,9/11/2012,Horrible!!

Jack M.,"Boston, MA",121,1206,326,1.0,8/7/2009,"Bland city. After eating here with a buddy of mine, he stated ""This place is where you would go if you lost all your tastebuds"".   He's right. I hate Applebees.  It's so bland.  I can cook better than this with my eyes shut. PLEASE don't go here!  Applebees is the epitome of what a crappy chain restaurant is all about!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Suzi L.,"Burbank, CA",8,173,32,4.0,2/17/2012,I always hit up Applebee's when I am in town because I am destined to see someone from my past here! Food is always good and the drinks are always strong! I have had many good nights here and hope to have many more!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
BonBon H.,"Middlesex, MA",0,36,,2.0,4/3/2011,"First off, the hostess was super friendly. But when we met our watiress, she seemed much more preoccupied with her many other tables that it took her fifteen minutes to order our food and drinks. The food didn't even come out for half an hour! I feel that is so long to wait for a meal. The food was just oke and the portions weren't that great. I've had better elsewhere. The drink that we got from the bar was pretty good though. Overall, this was a meh experience. I feel that for the prices you can get a lot better elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Diane H.,"Boston, MA",436,685,723,2.0,12/29/2008,"I don't know..I wouldn't come here for the food. I only came here about three times for the OreO Milkshake..and I was hungry so I guess if you're hungry..it will do. I don't like their quesadilla (sp), tastes gross, the chicken fingers as I call them are so dry. Yeah, I'd only come here for the shake, it's that damn good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Liz T.,"Sterling, MA",21,53,,3.0,3/11/2011,"I usually call the chain Crapplebees but this one was decent. Cute, fun waitress was very attentive. Food was alright though kind of boring. My husband enjoyed his fajitas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden

Beth M.,"Kingston, MA",150,314,,2.0,1/17/2008,"Is this a preview of what my life will be like when I move to suburbia?  Round up the kids and settle in for some riblets and dessert shooters at my neighborhood Applebees? Thanks to a gift certificate bestowed upon us by my father-in-law, my man and I took a weeknight voyage to our local Applebees, and I may lose all credibility for this, but it wasn't half bad.  Really.  At least my dinner, which was mac n cheese with grilled chicken.  A bit heavy but try as I might, I can't say that I didn't enjoy it.  I also enjoyed my Sam Adams Winter, and our waitress was really nice. But because it's a chain, which I detest (sorry, call me a snob) and because my husband's 'riblets' looked positively revolting, I can really only surrened 2 of my precious stars to Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Tom D.,"Peabody, MA",57,305,11,1.0,9/5/2009,"A group of us went here last night for a late dinner.  One member of our party asked for his burger medium well.  The waitress replied,  ""So you want pink or no pink?""  Confused by the question, he again said, ""I'd like it medium well.""  Our waitress then explained that the only ways they could take a burger order was for pink or no pink. Are you kidding me?!?!   I also ordered a burger and when asked about how I'd like that cooked I said ""I would like it as pink as you can legally serve it.""  Needless to say, my burger came out dry and brown all the way through.  Come on Applebee's.  Is the possibility of food poisoning here so high that your lawyers were forced to concoct this ridiculous policy?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Shawn F.,"Boston, MA",15,51,3,3.0,6/12/2008,"I think just about every time I come in here, I see at least 2 people from high school.  I would never think a chain to be a towny place, but thats really what this place has turned into.  Maybe the townies think this is what fine dining is.  I can't really talk though because I haven't dined fine enough yet either.  I think there are better alternatives for chain restaurants though.  I prefer Fridays and Texas Roadhouse to Applebees.   The waiters and waitresses are usually over nice or really big meanies.  I like how it looks inside though.  They have light wood all over and a nice bar in the center of the place.  There are also some TVs that you might be able to catch a peak of around the bar.   The food is satisfying, but there isn't any WOAH! factor.  They have some good lunch deals that are pretty cheap.  It's anything you would expect from an Applebees.  The appetizers are good, but typical.  I guess the big thing now is the mini cheeseburgers.  There is a good selection of entrees, but I don't think I would get steak from here.  I would rather spend the money at a steak house.  The desserts are pretty good too.  Overall, I would say the food is average.   If you do make a stop in here and aren't from the area, beware of  high school reunions going on around you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
Alesha H.,"Malden, MA",0,6,,3.0,7/13/2008,"I've been here a few times, but only because they have that thing where you can get an appetizer, a dinner, and a dessert for 10 bucks. The food is somewhere between ok and i'm going to throw up, mostly depending upon what you order. Also, the desserts are bad. But the people are nice and the karaoke is nearly as bad as it could be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-malden
