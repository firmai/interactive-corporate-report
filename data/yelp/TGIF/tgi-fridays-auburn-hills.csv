Arnmd P.,"Rochester Hills, MI",3,16,93,4.0,2/13/2015,"I was surprised to see the overall rating for this restaurant was only two stars so I took the time to read through some of the reviews and mostly it seemed that they ended up with very poor service that particular day. I feel very sorry for those people that they had that sort of situation but I can only say that in the many times that we have been at this particular restaurant service was always very good. People were kind, they were prompt and the food was excellent.  In my opinion all of the sizzling chicken dishes are excellent. And for dessert the Tennessee whiskey cake is the best in the area. I also recommend that you become a stripes number it's a decent deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills
Shauna S.,"Ann Arbor, MI",51,20,18,2.0,1/3/2018,"We used to love coming here, but lately they have been really disappointing. Long wait times for food when the resturant is basically empty during the week, cold food when it is finally delivered, and the quality of the good has also gone down over the years. And very inattentive servers and staff. You're lucky if you see your server after they take your order, they only show back up to drop the bill and take money. A different staff member usually drops off the food, and no one checks back to see if your food is okay or if you need anything. Very sad to see this place go so down hill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills
Codie Nicole B.,"Lake Orion, MI",80,124,88,4.0,2/14/2017,"Went here late on a Friday night after no being able to get service down the road at Mongolian grill. Warm welcoming from hostess and staff. Our server was very attentive and quick.  Despite him having multiple tables we were checked on regularly. Our fried green beans were brought out quickly and hot.  Food came out hot and fresh. Ordered the salmon Cobb salad and switched out romaine for mixed greens, it was delicious! Salad was a lot bigger than what I expected, needless to say I was stuffed. Also impressed with the size of the salmon for the salad usually places wanna give you a small piece; not the case here. The boyfriend ordered a mahi mahi sandwich which I was told was delicious as well. Tgi will be added to the list of main spots to hit up!

I went 2 days ago and the answer to why is clear, they food is terrible. Had the sliders, you could substitute a hockey puck and it would have been better. It was dry, tasted like the seasoning was a table spoon of sugar and the bun was stale. 3 other diners were with me and everyone complained about the food.

Sara P.,"Auburn Hills, MI",62,2,,1.0,9/25/2017,"Went here around 2 Saturday. Was very slow, so was our service. We got the spinach dip as our appetizer and it was ok, but I'm not sure why they changed it because it used to be really good. Didn't get much for the price either. I ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta and it was horrible...like they just mixed some tomato paste with overcooked noodles  I got sliders for my 5 year old, and when the waitress asked if she wanted cheese, my daughter said yes...well they put Swiss cheese on it, which didn't make my 5 year old very happy.

Jeffrey S.,"Lapeer, MI",2,12,3,2.0,2/28/2015,"I read the reviews here on Yelp before going to the restaurant and decided to give it a chance despite the poor reviews. I went in with low expectations and those low expectations were met. It was mid-afternoon on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy at all. We were seated right away and drinks brought out and order taken promptly. Our appetizer came out in a prompt manner and was very good. But, after a short time my sister's order came out and not mine. It was about 5 minutes before mine made it to the table. The waitress said they, apparently the kitchen, ""wanted her to bring my food out before it died!"". Apparently they don't know how to time the orders with the cooking so as to bring all the orders out at the same time, like every other restaurant knows how to do. Once I saw my order I realized they didn't get it right. It was missing both side dishes and came with a vegetable side which I didn't order. The manager, at least I think he was, since he didn't introduce himself as one or wore a name tag or a uniform, went right back and brought the sides to me. He was nice and concerned though, which was good. The waitress was also nice, but didn't seem to be on top of her game. When she took our order she didn't write anything down and relied on her memory which probably contributed to her forgetting half of my order. The food was okay. My sister's chicken was very dry and my half slab of ribs was slightly dry. But my steak was good. Due to all the mishaps, they knocked off $7 from the price of the appetizer, which was mozzarella sticks, from the bill. Despite that I don't think I'll be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills?start=20

Never was a fan of the food from past experience but I had no choice since I let my inexperienced guests choose the place. Worst customer service I've ever experienced and this is coming from someone that works in customer service too. The side of broccoli my guest received was old, rubbery, and disgusting. I asked for Mac N Cheese as my side but instead got a ridiculous half scoop of cold flake Mashed Potatoes. After we requested a fix to this, both waitress completely ignored us and ran around like chickens with their heads cut off when it wasn't even that busy; 5 tables including my party of 4.

We were not greeted when we walked in the doors of TGIF we had to walk to the back to find someone to seat us. And with just our luck it was Karina.

Chun H.,"Lake Orion, MI",3,10,,2.0,4/21/2014,"Once upon a time there was a young kid who rarely got to eat out. His parents were boring you see, and they never got out of the house. Among the few times that this kid got to eat out, he never manged to try enough of any menu to get a feel for his preferred dish. There were a few times where waiters/waitresses would serve other tables with hot steamy sizzling dishes, drawing the attention of all nearby hungryfolk. Each time this happened the kid would think in his head: ""Where the hell was that on the menu?!?"". Now it is 2014 and most restaurants have obtained enough competence to make such dishes distinct from the rest (...because they are). Much to my childhood glee, which I plan on carrying with me until worms eat out my eye sockets, I took the chance to order one of these attention-grabbing meals. Time passed, and finally our waiter arrived at our table with our orders. Ugh. Not only was my dish not sizzling, but the cheese was also cooled down to a mucky consistency. The food tasted OK (I didn't eat any of the cheese), but half of my order was due to the promise of something appealing beyond your average 'merican dish of a burger and fries. That half got shafted so hard that it would have been more comfortable in a steel mill operated by male po*n stars. This could have been due to a slow waiter or a lame chef but either way, my experience was balls.

I ordered a burger and was glad the waiter asked how I would it prepared.  I love my medium-rare burgers.  It came out well done.  Unfortunately, the waiter waited over 10 minutes to check in on us and attempts to flag down another staff member were unsuccessful.  Apparently their personal conversations took priority.  He was apologetic and told me he would put a rush job on a medium rare burger.  15 minutes later another burger came out - again well done.  I took a few bites, but my companions were already done with their meals, so I boxed up the rest for later.

Aaron A.,"Flint, MI",1,12,7,5.0,2/5/2012,I need to take my other review back 5 stars!! Last night the place was slammed. Not their fault but the mgr comped us 15 bucks on our bill and we never had to say a word about the service. Quality management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills?start=40
Mimi M.,"Auburn Hills, MI",0,9,,2.0,8/8/2014,"This place used to be very good for a chain restaurant.  I always sit in the bar, so I don't know much about the restaurant service.  But I can tell you this: don't go to the bar side before 4:00 when Sam is working.  She doesn't pour anything close to a full pour, she's cranky and rude, and her service is poor.  She brought us food before silverware, then disappeared before we could get her attention.  And the place was empty, so there was no excuse for this.  We had to flag down the lady at the front door (Karina might be her name), and she was all rude and huffy and rolling her eyes because we nicely asked her for silverware and salt and pepper so we could eat.  Food used to be very good for a chain, but now it's quite inconsistent.  Sometimes good, sometimes lousy.  Sometimes moist and tasty, sometimes dry and overcooked.  They need more consistency in how they cook steaks and burgers.  You can order rare through well-done, but what you actually get is apparently a crap shoot.  And they really need to clean the bathrooms more often.  The women's room is usually totally trashed and stinky and disgusting, and it wasn't like that a few years ago.  Also, the bar now smells like a dirty recycling bin, and it didn't used to smell like that.  Drew the manager tends to spend his time bothering the female patrons with his lame chatter rather than attending to the business.  Friendly is one thing, but this dude doesn't know when to shut up and walk away.   I will say that they have some very good bar tenders in the evenings.  Yafeu, Fudgy, Chris, new dude Kyle, and Dana are great.  They all make very good drinks and are good servers who make the place fun.  That's what makes me go back.  You'll see the place is empty in the daytime because of Sam.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills?start=40
Stephanie A.,"Washington, MI",0,6,1,2.0,7/19/2014,Good service. Anna was our server. Super nice. Green bean french fries are a must! The bathrooms are nasty and really unkept though; there was paper towel in the sinks and no soap and toilet paper all over the floors. And there was no little garbage bag inside where the tampons go so that's kinda disgusting too :/,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills?start=40
K. K.,"Lapeer, MI",0,13,,3.0,8/10/2012,"Had lunch here today and it was quite tasty, however, when I attempted to visit the restroom, it was in shambles! Paper all over the floor, the middle stall had no lock, when I tried to bring it to the attention of anyone, no one was anywhere to be found. Just bizarre...would have been 4 stars, but since the restrooms are essential.... Not a chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills?start=40
Jaelynn D.,"North Hills, CA",66,535,331,1.0,5/28/2008,"I used to work here and not only is the management completely biased but they are very rude and racist.  I used to be a hostess and had lots of black button downs and they were so ignorant that they thought I wore the same shirt and actually had a meeting with me. (I was in dress code) If you're not white don't even enter, because once you're seated you're going to get the worst service ever.  They also don't know the differences in Asian people either. Like I said; racist and bitchy. Go to National Coney instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills?start=40
K M.,"Boston, MA",170,703,65,4.0,4/7/2006,"I'm kind of anti-chain restaurants, but this being across from Oakland U, my history class used to head there afterwards for beers, hugely interesting discussion, and of course, sesame chicken fingers.  Used to catch Pistons players in there on occasion.  They're not hard to spot, being about a head taller than everyone else.  Many fond memories were made here:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn-hills?start=40
