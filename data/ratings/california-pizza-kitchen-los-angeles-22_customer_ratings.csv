As a child, and as an adult now. Still in love with that pizza. The other pizzas here aren't bad either. You really can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here. They have other meals here too if you aren't a big pizza fan. This place has a great kids menu with a lot for the kids to choose and a lot of different pastas and salads. The food here is pretty cheap as well. I recommend coming here if you have a big group. It is cheap, fun, and the food is good.

Personally, I prefer this restaurant to the CPKs in Beverly Hills or Westwood.  It is more spacious.  There is ample parking available and good shopping, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

I found it was the small things that quickly added up, I ordered Ice Tea and then asked for sweet and low - I had to ask for it twice.   The pizza was delivered to our table and we asked for crushed red pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The crushed red pepper was never delivered and we had to ask two more times for the grated Parmesan which finally arrived half way through the meal.  I couldn't get a refill on the Iced Tea.   At one point during the meal, I noticed the waiter was clearing the next table over from us.  As he did, something fell off the plate.  He looked down, saw it and instead of picking it up, he kicked it under the booth.

22,Paul S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,3.0,2017-11-12,"We love this restaurant, but our most recent visit was a bad experience. Since Eataly opened, the place isn't as busy, which for us was a good thing. But the service has taken a quantum leap backward. When we walked in, no one was at the front reception area, where we waited for a good 2-3 minutes.  When the guy finally arrived, he didn't really seem interested, but sat us promptly. We had a nice waitress, but we waited a long time for the food. My entree size salad was about the size of my wife's half salad, maybe minutely larger. The waitress confirmed there was no mistake, but I sent it back anyway, only to have it returned an imperceptibly bit larger. We've been coming since it opened several months ago, and love the menu, as well as their fun promotions through the CPK app. There are a lot of new small plates...we've tried them all, and they're all delicious. It's not cheap, but still reasonably priced and good quality. But the suddenly smaller portions were an unpleasant surprise, and this was the first time we left still kind of hungry and feeling a bit ripped off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

9,Angel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,120,,1.0,2017-11-13,"Bad management and clear health code violations.   We had some time to kill before a movie so we decided to wait for a table this past Saturday evening.  Though there were a few empty tables, we were quoted a 50 minute wait.  Fine.  Over 50 minutes pass, and we go back and check.  Were told another 10-15 minutes.   We were finally seated in a booth near the window and open kitchen.  Directly across from us was a large family, who had their medium-sized dog under the table.  I love animals and own dogs but hello? There is no outdoor seating area, this is inside the restaurant, and that dog was CLEARLY NOT a service animal.  There was no vest, and the owners were playing with it, putting it on their laps and taking pictures with it.  There was a big puddle of water and other gross stuff under that table from either the family or the dog.  We asked our server (who was very nice) whether the restaurant permitted this and she said yes.  Yes?  This is clearly against the health code.  Either she doesn't know the law or didn't want to make a fuss.  Probably the latter, which I understand, but management should know better. As we were waiting for our food, my friend who was sitting across from me and facing the kitchen, pointed out that the cooks on the line were eating the food.  I turned around and saw it.  And they were not wearing any gloves.  Ewwww.  Come on now, wtf. TLDR:  this place is badly managed and disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
38,Kyle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,22,,1.0,2017-11-18,"Worst nightmare ever. The two hostesses were confused, confusing, and vague yet polite at least. They did a poor job of managing the crowd at the door, as several people were addressed and helped who arrived after myself. I felt invisible to them. Finally I spoke up. ""Two for dinner"" I said. They told me it was a 45 minute wait. I looked around and the restaurant was only half full. I was confused. I asked why such a wait with so many empty tables. They hostesses confessed to me that the kitchen asked them to stop seating people. ""Why"", I asked. They went on to explain the kitchen was short staffed and backed up more than an hour. For a half full restaurant. Then they two hostesses directed their attention away from me to someone who stated ""just me, party of one"". They said they couldn't even sit him because they had no tables for one. I'm am just beside myself that an iconic chain restaurant such as CPK could be in such a state of confusion, mismanagement and disarray. They really need to pull it together from the top down. Staffing, training, customer service, should all be looked at. Terrible experience. It should not go un noted. That's all.

Wine glasses were delivered, but they were dirty with fingerprints. Another server then delivered our appetizers; when we mentioned we got no water or place settings; he brought them, however he failed to return with my wine glass.  Even sitting next to the bar, it took too long to get clean glasses or get replacement glasses.  At this point, we called the main hostess, and she was prompt and got glasses.  However, when poring the wine, she inattentively overpoured the first wine glass when the bottle was meant to pour for 8 people!. It was all bad follow through:  No silverware.  NO water. Late delivery of silverware, water and wine glasses (albeit dirty).  The food and taste was fine.  Execution of service: POOR.  Why did they not follow thru and deliver quickly upon all requests?  We did see our first server working on other tables without first completing our requests.  And, while a birthday was mentioned, NO one followed thru nor with cake or ice cream.  We were extremely disappointed in service of CPK.  With physicians in our grop, we selected CPK for his healthier meal options, quick service and reputation.  Needless to say, we were very displeased and saddened by the terrible service.  People were polite, but delivery was lacking; NOT in keeping with CPK reputation for an exacting clientele.  While we were not charged for corkage of the wine, this is a minor benefit for the poor/lacking service; this does not in any way compensate for substandard service.  We could have celebrated with 8 people elsewhere in this high-end Century City mall, but we chose your venerable institution.  We were let down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22?start=20,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
4,Latinfoodie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,43,1.0,1.0,2017-12-04,Food at CPK has never been an issue. The service at this location is another story. As I am writing I am still waiting for the bread and I am 90 percent done with the food. Other tables received bread right away so why not mine. The waiter realized his mess up and instead of owning it he gave outlandish excuses questioning my intelligence. I told him to fetch the bill. The manager came over to apologize but offered excuses. I called her out and that's when she saw me writing the review. She did the right thing and gave me a free meal. To add my boss was given the wrong salad.

2,Bailey K.,"Los Angeles, CA",499,80,267.0,2.0,2017-12-04,"This is your standard run-of-the-mill CPK location with below average service.  We came here for a ""quick"" dinner before a movie on a Saturday night. It was clear that the place was totally understaffed because one-third of the tables were empty/had dishes left from the previous diners but our wait time was still 30 minutes. We were fine with that and just explored the mall for a bit.  When we were seated it took us about 10 minutes to get a server to take our order (mushroom pizza, cauliflower wings & mac n cheese bites). When the cauliflower wings came out, they were missing the cheese crumbles so we sent it back and it took 15 minutes from that point to get them back again.  We also did not have silverware and after waiting another 5 minutes on that, just took it from an empty booth a few seats over.  The food is decent but the overall dining experience of an undertrained/understaffed restaurant is pretty disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-22,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

They've made some pretty noticeable improvements and the food options now go beyond pizza, pasta and salad to include more varied and healthier. My recent favorite is the Banh Mi. The drinks are good, as always. And the pizzas and salads are still delicious. The first time I visited this location at the Century City mall, it was the middle of the afternoon and the restaurant was quiet. The last visit was during lunch time, right at the peak of the busiest time. But service was excellent. We were seated promptly and got all of our food quickly. Very happy in that respect. I'm giving CPK 4 out of 5 stars because they could improve the ambiance a little bit, so it feels less like a chain restaurant.
