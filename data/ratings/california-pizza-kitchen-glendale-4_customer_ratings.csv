123,Elaine C.,"New York, NY",30,149,66.0,4.0,2012-02-01,Passed this CPK after going to Simply Fondue's and we decided to try this place out.  Fairly quick service here and the food was quite good. It could be my new favorite chain before TGIFriday's.  The lemon chicken pasta was so delicious! I'm a big lover of lemon-flavored anything so this was a yummy choice. Boyfriend got the meat lovers pizza which was good too. As appetizers we got the fried mac & cheese and the Korean bbq tacos. I had really high hopes for the mac & cheese but it wasn't anything spectacular. The Korean bbq tacos had a spicy kick to it that I would totally go for again. Ended the night with a chocolate brownie with ice cream.. the brownie wasn't soft! I thought I would break the spoon eating it.

The wait staff was pretty friendly and they were very accommodating with our small child.  Overall, I would go back here again if in a pinch and needed to find a place to eat with a group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=140,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.6960000000000006,3.4000000000000004
187,Synthya S.,"KEW GARDENS, NY",2,49,17.0,2.0,2012-07-18,"First let me start by saying this is not a review of the food. The food was great. I had the BBQ with bacon pizza, my husband had The Works, and my kids had the steak tacos. We loved our food and drinks. This issue that I have is with the service. We were seated quickly, no wait time. We sat in a booth by the left wall and the entrance. We sat for almost 10min before someone took our drink order. The server do not apologize for the delay, she just asked us for our drink order.  I feel that this lack of acknowledgment was rude. Since we waited so long we were able to give our entire order. She did not check on use at all once our meal was brought out to our table. It was not until the end of our meal that she brought us refills. I am not wanting someone to kiss my behind but as a prior server I expect courtesy and a friendly attitude. We gave her a 15% tip down to the penny, but I really could have left her nothing because she did not do anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=200,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.7600000000000007,3.3200000000000003

The second encounter at CPK we waited 10 minutes to be greeted(mind you the place was surprisingly empty) after ordering drinks we then waited another 10 minutes for it to arrive.

I don't know what kind of dough they use for the crust (I had the three cheese & tomato pizza - slammin!) but it was to die for! We had the panko breaded mac & cheese for appetizers - OMG! Little bites of cheesy heaven hiding in panko bread! Who knew it would taste so good! At least if you're into fried foods - lol! Drinks were good, we had a passion fruit mojito and a cosmopolitan (can't decide which drink was better!) Waiting staff was pretty good overall and not as snobby as you think they would be for being in Atlas Mall.

The food was hit or miss. THe first time, the Chicken milanese was tender and tasty. THe second time, it was dry. Same with the salmon. And the pasta with cream sauces were bland, not enough cream for my liking, as I felt as if I was just eating pasta. But that depends on a person's preference.

136,Ken T.,"Rego Park, NY",386,123,62.0,5.0,2013-02-14,"Came here today for Valentine's Day dinner with my girlfriend and even though it was a very busy night, we were seated almost immediately by a very welcoming waitress. We ordered the $30 Valentine's Day meal which included an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert. For the appetizer we chose the Spinach Artichoke Dip which was amazing. The portion was more than enough for the both of us and the dip was savory to the last bite. We also ordered a Mango-Raspberry Colada to go with our meal and this is WELL WORTH the $4.50. Usually, I am not a big fan of spending so much for a drink. I mean, why spend 5 bucks on a drink when I can get an entire box of Halal?? But I have to say, this drink was Delicious. Amazing. And Pure Joy to Drink. Need I say more? For the entrees, I ordered the Five Cheese Pizza (based on the reviews on Yelp) while my girlfriend ordered the KungPao Spaghetti. The pizza was amazing. The blend of different cheeses melting in your mouth makes you never want to stop eating. And the KungPao Spaghetti provided a unique blend of Asian and American flavor to the table.  For the dessert, we got the Belgian Chocolate Souffle which was tasty but nothing too special. Overall, I think this place did an amazing job in serving their customers. The food was great, and they have great staffs. The people there are extremely friendly and they genuinely care about your experience there.

Here are a few positive & negative experiences: About 9 months ago i came with my girl friend & her daughter. We wanted a simple lunch because her daughter is young and we didnt want to hang out too long but the food took about an hour to come out, it was cold, and management didnt do anything for us. However we came here for my boyfriends cousins birthday with a group of about 10. The service was great along with the food so A+ on that. But I came a few days ago at 9:28pm and the girl at the front (who i actually knew from high school) told me they couldnt seat us because they stop seating at 9:30pm.

139,Giancarlo D.,"Waldwick, NJ",83,6,1.0,2.0,2013-06-20,"Just had the weirdest experience. CPK, I love you but I don't know what happened. My table ordered two salads. One came with way too much dressing. The other came with barely any. Figured I'd bring mine home and add some dressing from my fridge and eat it later. Before I could tell the waitress my request she had the dirty bottom of the other dish in my salad.

124,Alvar L.,"Staten Island, NY",66,19,,1.0,2013-07-23,"Came here with my girlfriend on a Monday evening. We were seated by a very bored, uninterested, preoccupied teenager who must have been practicing her best robot impersonation.  She commanded: ""Two? Sit. Enjoy.""  So we sat, went over the menu, and waited... and waited... and waited...  20 minutes pass and we've pretty much memorized the menu. We were hungry. But there was no server or waitress in sight. Since being seated, no one else had come to help us. No waters, no silverware, not even a little cocktail napkin to place drinks on. Did they forget us? It wasn't like we were hard to find; we were smack dab in the middle of the restaurant floor. And it wasn't exactly a busy night, either. We looked around and notice all of the unhappy faces juxtaposed on the other customers. Some were visibly annoyed waiting to order, and others had finished eating before we had even arrived and sat awkwardly, waiting for the check.  In other words: service was slower than slow. A couple near us left a booth seat, so we asked the busboy wiping it down if we could switch to the booth. As he was just the busboy and had no real pull in the restaurant, he goes to relay our message to the uninterested teenage robot.  She doesn't say a word to us, but speaks only to the busboy in Spanish. Thanks to my 8th grade Spanish skills, I overheard her mention that she wanted to reserve the booth for parties of more than 2 people. So the busboy comes and tells us no. Not 5 minutes later, she seats a party of 2 in that very same seat. Having wasted a half hour of our time to be completely ignored, we left. And that's okay, because this is New York City; you don't need to go to some national strip-mall chain restaurant for good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=120,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.372,3.3600000000000003

It's either Vietnamese, Filipino or Italian food for us.  CPK is located inside Atlas mall. A great outdoor mall but most of the time overlooked. If there is anything that has always been here since I started coming, it's the theatre, Simply Fondue, Starbucks and this place. It was packed on a Saturday afternoon, no wonder it stayed open. We were  promptly seated as soon as we got there. Apparently, everyone else waiting outside wanted booth seating. Hmmmm...more space for me then. We ordered two small plates, a white corn guacamole with chips and spicy fennel sausage with pepper flat bread. I cannot quite remember but I believe they were both under $5 if not a little more. Guacamole was fresh and the white corn made great sense as my taste bufs loves it. The flat bread was also great and could definitely take the place of the thin crust pizza. For our main dishes, we shared Hawaiian thin crust pizza (besties fave) and Pesto Penne with shrimp. Pizza was alright. Sweet pineapple and ham always a good combo. I've always gotten their BLT pizza since I first tried it back in the day, a slight deviation from my norm but didn't hurt a bit. Pasta dish was creamy, the penne does look like it wasn't fresh and may have come from dry boxed pasta but it was cooked perfectly.

155,Nyc C.,"MIDDLE VLG, NY",0,6,,1.0,2015-06-21,"TRULY TERRIBLE SERVICE.  At first, my kids used to enjoy the food here, but out of the 8-10 times we ate here, service was slow to downright neglectful more than half the time. I have worked in the service industry and I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but without exaggeration, we had to wait just shy of 40 mins for dessert once, and had to wait close to that for food on two other occasions. The final straw was when the last time a manager or assistant manager was waiting on us and the food came out very sporadically. My daughter had to wait 10 mins for her meal, and they brought out the three other meals several mins apart in the mean time. Then I had to literally walk around the restaurant trying to find someone to get us dessert and pay the bill. So disorganized!!  Today (several months later) we decided to give them one more chance and used their website's ""curbside pick up"". I was SHOCKED at the ineptitude of this service. I had a pick up time scheduled for 6:39pm. I arrived a few mins after that and called. No answer for 3 full mins of ringing. After a few more minutes, my friend went in, only to be told they had JUST put our food in the oven. (Now 10 mins AFTER my pick up time.) When he asked where I could wait since there was no place to stop for curbside pickup, the very rude woman shrugged her shoulders. He asked when it would be ready and she shrugged again. So I ended up circling this crowded mall parking lot for over TWENTY FIVE MINUTES, the whole time trying to call a manager who never picks up. Exactly 30 mins after my pick up time I parked and went in to find they were FINALLY  packing up my food and didn't seem the least bit concerned that I had been waiting so long. I finally got to see the managerial, who mumbled something about being busy and offered a very insincere, ""we apologize for any inconvenience, but we are busy."" My kids even agreed this time that their pizza is mediocre at best. I highly recommend finding a good local place, because those who run this restaurant truly DO NOT CARE about how they treat their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=140,2.96,3.14,3.14,2.084,3.0680000000000005

It was partly super funny but partly annoying having to be afraid an umbrella would fall on us during our meal. The manager and another worker eventually came out to fix the umbrellas so that made us feel slightly better even though they were unsuccessful. It felt like we were on an episode of Candid Camera.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was slightly runny but had decent flavor.

Everyone's food looked good, but my fish tacos were not- I am not one to send  a meal back but I couldn't eat it! The texture was not appealing, nor was the taste (I normally love fish tacos). The lime they served it with was so dry I couldn't squeeze a drop of juice out of it. I only ate one of the three tacos on my plate and it contained the stem of the avocado inside- yuck!

55,Prieta S.,"MIDDLE VLG, NY",57,10,,3.0,2015-11-02,"Very dissatisfied with this CPK located in Atlas Park.  I've been going to this spot for as long as I've been living in the neighborhood (4 years) and I've NEVER experienced a bad visit until now.   The quality of the food is good.  Lots better than Chili's, which is located in Atlas Park as well.    The service, however, has changed dramatically and not for the better.   I went yesterday with my son because I wanted to have their rib eye, which is very good.  Even though for some reason I can't get a steak medium as I've asked for, more than once. Since I've noticed that service has been declining at this location, I started my timer on my phone to see how long it would take a waiter to come to our table.  It took almost 10 minutes for a waiter to come to our table and it was only because my son flagged down the hostess and informed her that we had been waiting 10 minutes and no one had come to take our order.   Florian finally came to our table and took our drink order and since we had so much time to look at the menu, took our entree order as well.  We noticed that Florian was the only one working the section we were in, so we really can't blame him as we noticed two waitresses walk in while we were waiting at the table.  We assumed they ran late.  The whole process took so long...almost an hour and we had not been served our drinks that we left.  I made sure to tell the hostess so that she was aware that we had been waiting so long, it was unacceptable.  And by the way, the location was no busier than it normally is on a Sunday at that time (early afternoon).   We ended up going to Chili's, which was just as busy, perhaps, busier since their restaurant is much bigger than CPK, was seated right away and I don't think we waited 3 minutes before our waitress came to our table and took our drink order. CPK is still a very good restaurant.  The food is great, but it doesn't matter if the service is not on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=60,2.24,2.93,2.93,3.0200000000000005,2.654000000000001

The restaurant has gone through its fair share of managers, menu options and physical changes throughout the years. I remember always loving the fresh taste of their food and would frequently visit, despite my aversion to food chains. However, I had a bad experience at the restaurant about 6 months ago that put me on a CPK hiatus. I was a little apprehensive about returning, but I'm glad that I did because this time the service and food were wonderful. We had an extremely attentive waitress that would frequently check up on us and would refill our drinks and bread baskets using what seemed like telepathy. We never had to flag her down. The managers and waitress cheerfully waited on us throughout our stay. The food was equally great. We ordered the spinach artichoke pizza from the fall menu and it was delectable; delicious notes of garlic and a creamy spinach sauce. We also ordered the Tostada pizza (Tex-Mex inspired) and the classic 5 cheese pizza. We got the Barbecue Chopped Salad to top it all off, and we doused EVERYTHING in their magical ranchito sauce. That sauce tastes like it was crafted by cherubs and made exclusively for the gods. If you visit CPK, do yourself a favor and get a side of the ranchito (trust me). For dessert we ordered several servings of the Butter Cake (a cult classic) and the salted caramel pudding (which I tried for the first time and Hallelujah!)

There is a bar area in the restaurant and they allow for big parties. The music levels were just right and the lightening was not too bright or too low.

I want to give this place 4 stars but I just can't. We were a party of 7 and we were seated quickly. We all sat down and waited 15 minutes for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink. Then, she took our drinks down and talked to her friend for another 5 minutes before giving us our drinks, we had to call her a few times before she came to us. Then, she must've misheard one of us and gave us so much attitude for the wrong order. For appetizers we got he crispy mac n cheese, spinach artichoke dip (with pita instead of chips), and the avocado club egg rolls. These were delicious, however the crispy mac n cheese wasn't that special. The BBQ chicken pizza was good but after a few bites it didn't have that wow factor anymore. The chicken in the salads (quinoa and arugula/ Cesar) had this burnt taste to it but the salad itself was amazing. Lastly, the garlic chicken and mushroom fettuccine was my favorite dish, the portions were great and I was stuffed.

126,Juliana G.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,1,,1.0,2016-03-30,"VERY UPSET AND NEVER COMING BACK!! This is my first time rating on YELP, and i felt that i needed to express my unsatisfying experience at CPK. On Sunday, March 27, 2016 my boyfriend and I were at Atlas Mall, and were hungry; so we decided to try CPK for the first time. We get there and my boyfriend gives the hostess his name. We proceed to wait for about 10 mins, and we noticed that a couple that walked in after us was seated. At first we thought nothing of it, until 3 minutes later another couple that came in after us was seated as well! So, my boyfriend and I were very upset, and he goes up to the hostess and asks her why were these people that came in after us were seated, and when she asked him for his name; my boyfriend sees his name crossed out! He tells her that's his name and its crossed out, meanwhile we're still waiting. HER explanation was that some other hostess must of called him, and sat another couple who pretended to be us down. HOLD ON! so you mean to tell me that outside of her being there, there is someone else sitting other people down. Never have i been to a restaurant where there are up to THREE or more people sitting customers down. SO, i we were very upset about that. So, we would assumed that the next table that was available would be given to us... NOPE, three more groups that came in after us was seated down.  We also asked for a table not next to the door, because that day was very chilly and i wasn't feeling well. When they do call us, they sit us by the door. So my boyfriend asks if we can sit somewhere else thats not by the door, and she said she couldn't, and if we want another table we have to wait another 10 mins! Meanwhile, i saw 3 open booths by the window emptied. That made me even more upset... to top it off i saw another couple that was sitting two tables down from us that was seated before us even though they got to the restaurant after us, were moved to one of the empty booths that i saw earlier. FYI the hostess told my boyfriend that they were the couple that were seated under our name by the other hostess!!! SO you mean to tell me that they were getting better treatment than us; after they pretended to be someone else! VERY UPSET!! Just to wrap it off the STRAWBERRY LEMONADE, THE ORIGINAL LEMONADE DID NOT TASTE GOOD, AND WHEN I ASKED FOR A SPRITE. THERE WASNT ANY LEFT. I got a coke instead... THE SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP HAD NO FLAVOR AND THE CHIPS WERE STALE.  The only thing that saved the place the the semi-good pizza. My boyfriend asked for crispy crust, and it was was soggy and falling apart. AND our waiter BRIAN EUGENE, his service was great! Even after changing my drink more than once, he did not make us feel like a bother  ((P.S. he didn't charge for our drinks)). He made us actually feel like customers who mattered, unlike the hostess'. Thank You for your service Brian!! But sadly, we will not be returning to the restaurant.

66,Jules A.,"Queens, NY",95,38,28.0,1.0,2016-06-18,"This CPK location is terrible.  There were 3 of us total and we actually got seated fairly quickly (within 10 minutes) even though the place looked packed. 1 star for that. We got a menu that actually had food inside of it and when asked for another, a waitress took it away with attitude as if we had placed the food in the menu.  It took the waiter forever to come introduce himself. It took him long enough for us to decide what drinks and food we wanted to order. We had a feeling it'd take forever to get his attention so we wanted to order it all in one shot. We ordered our drinks and then the food ordering came.... I got the salmon - fine, all good there. One person wanted the ribeye which we were told was out. Another wanted the chicken... Again... Out. Then they both tried to order a pasta dish..all seemed fine and then we found out there was no more fettuccini... And if you know their menu, practically every pasta dish is fettuccini based. One eventually settles for penne noodles (they end up giving spaghetti) and another settled for fish (which was of course dry). It took about 45mins to get the food. Throughout the meal, the waiter hardly checked in on us. A friend kept feeling something drip down on her and she didn't realize it was water of some sort dripping from the ceiling. We told the waitress behind us at the cash register (same one with the attitude from the menu incident) and she just rudely says ""I don't see anything."" And when my friend says that she can still feel it, the waitress brushes it off and just says ""okay i'll tell someone."" We end up telling our own waiter and his reply was ""I don't see how anything could be dripping from there. Maybe it's the AC then."" I mean we were just giving them a heads up and they were genuinely pissed off that we were doing so. In short, I'll never go back again. It takes a lot to piss me off to the point of not giving a tip to the guy. I usually at least give something, but this time I opted to give the money to charity instead of putting it on the tip line.

Sometimes your order is great sometimes it's not. I usually get the BBQ chicken salad to go, no dress extra BBQ sauce on the side. This last time was disappointing. The chicken looked like it was leftover from something else and there wasn't much of it, my side of BBQ sauce (which I basically use as dressing) I was given the small container and it wasn't even 1/4 full (usually they'll give the large with a good amount of BBQ sauce in it.) the tortilla strips in the salad were a bit stale. Again... Consistency, I've had this salad before from this location it's been great!  The bread that comes with it was in a small plastic bag with the oil, the oil opened and spilt all over it so it wasn't edible. Not really their fault but perhaps should look into a different way to store that for to go orders. In honesty I wasn't going to eat the bread anyways so this helped me out.

When the issue was addressed to the assistant general manager Don, he didn't care. He was very nonchalant about the situation. To make matters worse, he gives us comp small plate cards for our next visit which expires in July. It was like a slap in the face and giving excuses like ""we only have 2 waitresses""..  not a paying patrons problem. Instead of rectifying the situation properly, what makes you think I would even spend another penny at cpk? What's worse.. the general manager mike was hiding in the back and didn't even bother to show his face. It was poorly handled but thankfully Mike the kitchen manager handled a customer service issue. Does that even make sense to have the kitchen manager handle a customer complaint about service and not food?

Luckily, this location is close by and happy I can experience some of their delicious food (b/c honestly, you sometimes crave it).  I go to this location during off peak hours (weekdays around 2 or 3pm) and although I never had a horrible experience, I've never had a perfect experience. Yes, there staff is always polite and the servers are generally good but for off peak hours, I feel like it's still a little off.  Cons - Every time I go there, I always receive dirty appetizer plates such as dried, leftover food remnants the dishwasher couldn't quite remove. One time, the bottom plate was previously used and it somehow go to my table. Ew. - Although the restaurant is generally slow, it's always hard to get our server's attention. I would expect that during peak hours so I'm just a little confused at why their attentiveness isn't great. Pros - The food is pretty consistent every time I go there and I can't complain. You know what you're getting at CPK and this location delivers. I haven't had a bad meal yet (jinx!). - The managers there are great. Specifically Don O'Niel and Drew. About a month ago, I called the restaurant asking to speak to a manager about my dining experience earlier that afternoon. Although the server was nice, it was apparent he needed additional training. Don listened and seemed genuinely concerned about the service we received and offered complimentary apps for our next visit.

13,Jamie A.,"Woodside, NY",3,27,59.0,4.0,2017-09-18,It's alright. My fave thing here is the sangria and their buffalo cauliflower. It really takes like buffalo chicken wing lol!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.44,2.9,2.9,,2.716
25,Angelik M.,"Hollis, NY",1,15,,4.0,2017-10-04,I really liked the open kitchen. The food was pretty good. The wedge salad had far too much blue cheese dressing and the service was.....Okay. the drinks were great and the pizzas are a great size and very filling.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=20,2.4,2.93,2.93,,2.718
27,Jonathan S.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",213,8,3.0,5.0,2017-10-05,Great place to go for lunch and dinner. Their butter cake is literally one of the greatest cakes mixed with ice cream you will ever have! It is very unique and delicious! I love their pizza! The crust is perfect. Their pasta could have a little bit of work sometimes! Not always! Sometimes the pasta is a little hard but its not terrible. The service is great. I would recommend this california pizza kitchen any day. My favorite part about the restaurant is the fact that their drinks are amazing. The cucumber green sweet drink is insanee!! And the strawberry mango one is just as good! Im probaby going to head back to this california pizza kitchen in like a week or two haha.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=20,2.56,2.93,2.93,,2.782
3,Robert B.,"Queens, NY",44,6,4.0,3.0,2017-10-15,I always enjoyed coming here but just had the worst pizza ever with very minimal toppings...for $15 you should be tasting the toppings in every bite. The service was lackluster at best the servers seem to be more interested in talking to each other than taking care of their guests. The best part of the whole diner was the desert but you really have to try to screw up desert. Prob won't dine here again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.64,2.94,2.94,,2.8200000000000003

The food was great! I had the garlic Alfredo with chicken and shrimp. The sauce was perfect. Great amount of shrimp and chicken, worth the price. I can't wait to go back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.72,2.98,2.98,,2.8760000000000003
10,Derrick M.,"Austin, TX",1,1,1.0,1.0,2017-10-24,I have came to this location multiple times until  I was satisfied. Paid $16 for a small pizza and only had six pieces of tiny steak on it. Really disappointed. Honestly don't know what happened unless something changes I will not be paying $16 for this overpriced pizza.24October17,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.68,2.95,2.95,,2.8420000000000005
4,Milena M.,"New York, NY",144,68,120.0,4.0,2017-11-21,My husband and I went there around 9:30 pm to grab late dinner and even though the restaurant was closing at 10 pm they still took us in and served us. They seated us right away and were very kind. The waiter gave us enough time to look at our menus before he came to serve us. They greeted us with Bread and olive oil and water. Then they came up and let us order. We ordered the chicken garlic pizza and tomato basil soup. The soup was a little cold but I was not going to complain due to the fact that they were closing soon. I also ordered an orchid sangria which was so delicious! So try it if you are a wine drinker. Now the chicken garlic pizza was not bad but not the best I still like the Hawaiian better but my husband and I wanted to try something different! For a quick dinner cali pizza is the place to go! Good food and great service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.8,2.98,2.98,,2.908
15,Jenny T.,"Queens, NY",0,8,22.0,1.0,2017-11-28,This was horrible.   I went for my sons 14th Birthday  I thought since it was mid day around 230 it's dead you would think service should be at its game.  Sorry I went.    I had movie tickets for Justice League at 420 and they took so long to serve the food.  Then once the meal came the waitress never came to check up on us.  I had to get up at 410 to say hey.  My movie is in 10min I like to see the desert menu to celebrate my sons birthday with a cake.  She gave me the desert with the food still on table. She never picked up the dinner.  Now I'm sitting there with empty plates of food and desert.  Oh I gave her candles for my sons cake. She gave me back the candles didn't even put them on the cake.  I would never go back.  I refuse to give her a tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.8,2.98,2.98,,2.908
2,Glenn V.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1908,1126,1556.0,2.0,2017-11-29,"Having been given ye 'ole double thumbs up by a good friend with a bad palate, I pretty much had my expectations set -- and the settings were right. Petite Wedge is called a few different things at  various eateries, it seems that its the first word that changes, but Wedge word remains. I didn't really enjoy it unfortunately, Roma tomatoes - good, blue cheese - bad, if anything is anything -- lettuce is lettuce and it was and it was and I've no idea who Neuski is.  Being a lover of Thai food, the Thai Chicken Spring Tortilla Rolls really sounded good although I'm not a fan of the listed calorie intake model.  A bit too many sproutish greens, a little too little Thai Chicken was confined in their smallish Tortilla cocoon. The peanut sauce was quite good and I contemplated asking for a smattering to go. But after reflecting upon the slow and semi dismissive service, I thought it better to pay and leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.8,2.99,2.99,,2.9139999999999997
22,Bridget B.,"Bayside, NY",13,16,1.0,1.0,2017-12-12,Have been going there for months - now they no longer accept debit cards or credit cards that don't have a chip - have been using my debit card for months with no problem and not all credit cards have chips - took almost 1/2 hour to pay because while there were very few customers the server was very slow and then had to deal with a very rude manager - would not set foot in there again even if they offered me a million dollars - they suck!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4?start=20,2.64,2.99,2.99,,2.8500000000000005
1,Ro A.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1,56,1.0,1.0,2017-12-27,"How is this place still functioning ?  How ? I was here on December 24 in the afternoon doing the last minute shopping in atlas park when my daughter was a little hungry.  We went here and this Hispanic female  waitress was the worse ever I have seen.  I received the check and notice that new customers came in and this other waitress gives them bread with oil right away. When I later questioned my waitress about why didn't she serve us bread, her response was that they ran out of bread and that they had to go pick up , which  is a total lie.  Then I was waiting for her to pick up my check and I decided to go where the kitchen area is at because she was by the cashier .  I wanted my daughters food to go as well as my pizza .  This guy that works there took my daughters pasta and my pizza and put it in a pizza box.  How gross is that.  That was the most disgusting thing I ever saw in my life.  Not only did he do that, but my daughter had chicken in her pasta and I am a vegetarian.   He put everything all over the pizza box.   Gross and disgusting.  Also unprofessional.   This place has bad reviews and they should start looking into the manager here because apparently there is something wrong with this place.  Wake up manager.  Your doing a poor job",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale-4,2.6,2.97,2.97,,2.822
