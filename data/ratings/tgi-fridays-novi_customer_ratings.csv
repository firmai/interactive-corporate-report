21,Liz P.,"Clawson, MI",619,1189,2411.0,4.0,2014-05-25,"So I'm going to go ahead and be generous and give this Fridays a 3.5/5 stars, only because I've eaten here before and it's usually pretty good.  Starting off with the Pro's: the food today was delicious as always. My dad and I both redeemed Rewards from our Stripes, and he got the Jack Daniels flat iron steak and I got the chicken, with the tomato/mozzarella salad and mashed potatoes for sides. You get two HUGE pieces of chicken and I definitely had leftovers. My mom got the chicken skewers and liked those too.  We got our free Stripes app as well (chips and salsa) and that was also very good. Fridays seems to have revamped the look of its menu and it also has some new sides like cheddar mac and cheese.  I usually go to the Troy Fridays with a friend for their Sunday specials but it seems like those have changed too - they still have their daily 3-7pm happy hour but it's in the bar only, and we like sitting in booths.  Now, the Con's: my dad wanted to order the raspberry iced tea, which apparently they didn't have even though it's on the menu. The waitress suggested some sort of strawberry passion tea, and he ordered that and it was delicious. He ended up with 2 cups of it, only to find out later there were no free refills.... That's fine, but something the waitress should have at least mentioned.  I'd give this trip to Fridays three out of five stars but like I said, I've been to this location before and normally it's better. Hostess and waitress were both friendly, but I think the waitress was having issues figuring out all the coupons we were using (two Rewards and a free app) too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=20,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032

I asked for the burger to be burnt to a crisp and more than well done. Burger came out very lightly cooked and pink in the middle. I did not finish half of it.. Also ordered some grey goose and orange juice. That was heavily watered down.. Again, service was good hence the 2 stars. Wish I could give it more stars. Probably won't be coming here any longer.

Our server was a young man and I will not mention his name but the service was not up to par. For how slow this restaurant was he spent more time drinking a pop in the FOH or chatting with coworkers than focusing on his task at hand...being a bartender/server! When you are in the hospitality business, as I am as well, you make your money from your guests. So why spend more time with those who don't pay your bills? I ordered a drink with premium rum and could not taste it. Instead of sending it back and complaining I stayed compliant and asked for a shot of the rum that came in it. When I asked what kind that rum was he replied with, ""McCormick Rum"" which is $7 per bottle. What? How am I drinking well liquor when I'm paying $9 for premium? He laughs and says, ""I forgot my recipe for a moment!"" Does that mean my drink was originally made with well? Probably! No manager stopped by or at least never introduced themselves as a manager.

Our waitress didn't bring our food out and we pretty much didn't see her the rest of the night. After she took our order she didn't check on us one time. Anyway, the manager came to the table and asked if everything was tasting alright -_- first of all, she didn't greet us like a real manager would have. Only reason I knew she was a manager is, because of her clothes...which looked sloppy. She was very dry and she offered to recook my noodles in more sauce. My dad sent his back all together. The manager then came back with my food after another 10 minutes and after voicing our concerns on the wait, the quality of food, and the service all she said is ""I'm sorry, I'll talk to ur waitress"" her name is Val I guess short for Valerie. I then told her I was calling corporate and she said ""that's fine"" & came out with a piece of paper with her general managers name and number which was just the number to the store. I'll definitely be talking to a person higher up about her. She didn't offer anything off the bill, not a free dessert, NOTHING. Won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

18,Skylar K.,"East Lansing, MI",18,8,22.0,2.0,2016-07-09,"This was honestly the worst service I have ever received. Our waitress' name was Tori. First off our Long Island Ice Teas were so terrible that I'm sure my 6 year old cousin could have made a better drink. The food was alright at best, unfortunately my chicken was charred so much so that it left the most bitter taste in my mouth, I never believed until now that chicken could get so bitter. Also when you ask for fries extra crispy you'd certainly think that a soggy mess would be far from what you got however that is exactly what I received. The French dip was average at best, nothing to write to mom about and also not something that makes you question why you spent your money there. I ended up giving the tip our waitress (Tori) was supposed to receive to another waiter who was constantly checking in on us and making sure our experience was as enjoyable as possible. Waitressing 101 was obviously flunked by Tori, she yelled at us across the bar to ask if we wanted another drink, never asked how our meal was, never brought us our food and was quite frankly so much of a horny dits that she could not focus on anyone who wasn't male. So for future notice to anyone that goes there, if you are a male and sit at the bar I'm sure Tori will be more than attentive, however if you are a mother daughter duo who are out for a nice lunch, immediately request someone who can actually do their job, and someone who is not Tori.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

14,Sarah S.,"Brighton, MI",4,67,31.0,1.0,2016-09-22,"The worst TGI Friday's I've ever been to! The service is horrible! I came here on a Sunday with the four girls I care for. The place was not busy at all. There were maybe two people at the bar and one other table dining. We ordered our drinks and food right away. Everybody got their drinks (fifteen minutes later) except for the youngest child, who is 21 months. The waitress informed me that her chocolate milk needed to be made behind the bar and to give it a few minutes. Well, a few minutes turned into about a half hour. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. The baby was crying because she was so thirsty and upset her sisters has their drinks and she didn't. Ten more minutes go by and our food arrives. Still no drink. I mention it to the waitress again and she tells me she will go get the chocolate milk, but never does. She never even checks on us again until she brings us our check, which we were waiting for for nearly twenty minutes after we had empty plates. There was nobody around, it was ridiculous. Nobody to flag down, nobody to complain to. The staff was essentially nonexistent, but when they were around, they sucked.  If you want a good Friday's location, venture 20min West on 96 and eat at the Brighton location.

1,Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1181,306.0,3.0,2017-01-01,"I came here last night and haven't been to a TGIFriday's in quite some time. I don't know why, it just worked out that way. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided that 3 stars was more accurate about my whole experience. Fortunately, I was seated right away and the place wasn't super busy, especially considering it was New Years Eve (I ate ""early"" at 6:30 PM because I was dying of hunger.)  I was fortunate enough to have a really nice server who was amazing throughout the whole meal, which made a difference to me at the end.   For starters, I really didn't know what I wanted to eat, and ended up getting a burger.  My server did make a few recommendations on what he liked and was really good about conversing with me, but I ended up going ""simple"" and getting a standard cheeseburger.  I upgraded and got the sweet potato fries which were delicious, and I'm glad I did! Sadly, the burger tasted a bit over charred, to the point that by the end of the burger, it was just to much.  I know the menu description said charred burgers, but this was a bit much.  The sweet potato fries and the outstanding server seemed to compensate for the mediocre, over charred (to the point of almost tasting burned) burger I received for dinner. What would have made it 5 stars? I don't know that I can give specifics, but the experience wasn't bad at all.  I will say, I noticed a lot of dirty tables that hadn't been bused since I was seated to the point of me finishing my meal and checking out. I don't know if they were understaffed, but the whole time I sat at my table, I stared at a dirty booth with dirty dishes sitting on it straight across from me. I don't know if you can see it in the picture I took or not, but it sat there the entire time. Overall, a decent, solid experience all together.  I would return in the future, but not all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

0,Elizabeth Y.,"Northville, MI",0,30,,3.0,2017-07-22,"I was debating between three and four stars but ultimately, the good did not outweigh the bad in this case.  The good: The food was what I expected, except for the pot stickers which exceeded my expectations of what seems to be a burger/steak joint. I would definitely order those again, and in larger quantities. However, I won't be dining in.  The bad: The lack of service. I stood at the hostess podium for ten minutes with numerous staff just walking by me. The professional attitude at even the most basic restaurant suggests that passing staff would at least acknowledge the existence of a waiting customer.  (This is actually my second attempt at eating here. The first time, the restaurant was dead and I waited at my table for 30 minutes without even so much as a drink order. That's only excusable on the busiest of days)  ""Someone will be with you in a moment."" Is it that so hard? Especially when the restaurant is so slow? It seemed our server Ashley, would be more attentive but as soon as the food arrived, she disappeared. We were desperate to get her attention, even just for a couple drink refills. I guess this is one place where the empty glasses at the edge of the table isn't enough of a hint. And if she ever walked near the table, we could have said something.

That still stands true, we were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress gave my daughter some crayons and a coloring page to draw on while I looked over the menu. I ordered the White Cheddar and Broccoli soup for my girl and a house salad with ranch dressing on the side to start. The soup was pretty salty and was hard to eat. The salad didn't seem very fresh as the lettuce was browning. I ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese for dinner and shared it. That was very good, it came out ""sizzling"" as promised and tasted as good as I remembered. We were in and out and enjoyed most of the main meal. Overall, our service was great.

The bartender made horrible drinks and then, when we asked for something else, he never said, oh I'm sorry you didn't care for this - let me get you something better. He acted as if it were our fault.  The drink my mother ordered was so wrong and so un-drinkable. He lacked any customer service or bartending expertise. This is a bar with a huge bar menu and the bar was empty on a Saturday night. We should have known. Then the couple sitting behind us said they had received raw shrimp. The ""manager"" came out and threw the cook under the bus. The couple had the inept bartender, the ""manager"" and the ""cook"" come out to make excuses - not to resolve the problem. The couple were obviously on a date too -making this more appalling.. Nobody here takes any responsibility for the crap service crap drinks and crap food. No apologies to customers, just blame.
