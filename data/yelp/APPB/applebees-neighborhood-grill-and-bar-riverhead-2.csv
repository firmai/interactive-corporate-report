Bella D.,"St Albans, NY",71,12,68,1.0,4/5/2016,"Came here hoping for a decent meal after shopping at the outlets. On 4/3/16 I ordered a brunch burger and asked for the burger to be well done. When my food came out, I took a bite of the burger and to my disgust it was all pink inside. I called the waiter over and told him I wanted my burger well-done. He then looks at The burger with all the pink inside and says to me that's not well done? What the hell does it look like? So he took the plate to the back and brought it back out another 20 minutes later. By this time my party of three have finished eating already while I was just going to start. When I bit into the burger for the second time it still was not well done. I ate half of a burger and took the other half home. I went to the restaurant on Sunday later that night I threw up and today is Tuesday morning and I'm still having stomach pains, I'm pretty sure I got FOOD POISONING . I'm experiencing sharp upper stomach pains. The waiter needs more training, when bringing drinks to the table and other foods you don't reach over other people's plate. My waiter was a white Male with bluish eyes he may have been in his 30s.  If you get him as a waiter, I would leave ASAP. Oh never come to this place again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2?start=20
Ruben Q.,"Hicksville, NY",633,280,504,4.0,12/19/2013,"So me and my coworkers went to this location for lunch, and i have to say i started to wonder if this location was giving something away! it was pretty busy.  but we sat down like within 5 minutes and were promptly greeted by our server.   we ordered an appetizer that came within 10 minutes,  and the main entree soon there after.  the morale to this review is that the food is average like all your Applebees but the service was better.  i have to say that the food is always consistent...  Hey its Applebees!! lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2?start=20

Jay A.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,528,15,4.0,1/30/2014,"Night 2 in Riverhead and I opt for Applebee's.  While I am not a chain kinda guy Applebee's was not bad.  I told the waiter that I wanted their best Marguerita.  They made this perfect cocktail with Patron Silver with an olive?  that was pretty darn exceptional. I then had a good wedge salad.  The bacon was a tad overcooked or it would have been 5 star.  But it was a good salad and nothing to complain about. I then had some really good French Onion Soup.  Not 5 star but strong 4 star quality. Finished my meal with an ice cream sundae shooter.  Good but nothing to write home about. It was a good experience and I shall return along with 95% of the population here.  Looks like Applebee's is the place to be seen in Riverhead, NY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2?start=20

Renee M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,37,,2.0,8/23/2011,I really wish people wouldn't give this restaurant 4 stars for a couple reasons  1) The food isn't good. It's decent if you're starving...and everywhere else is closed but that's it. It's a gross chain full of salty frozen food.  A friend of mine found a piece of plastic in her nachos and another friend found a piece of frozen bacon in his ice cream (talk about the epitome of salty and frozen).  2) This is one of the first places in Riverhead that destroyed local restaurants and it's really sad. I know I'm at fault for  this because in High School Applebee's was the spot but I was 16..... Please just drive in to town and try to support the amazing local business that are struggling to survive there. Both your stomach and your conscious will thank you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2?start=20

Liv M.,"Calverton, NY",0,31,,4.0,10/12/2014,"( beer lover vegetarian). Came here on my one day off for local seasonal craft beer .... All out :-(.    Oh well enjoyed the beer anyway.   Started with the brew pub pretzels ( oh... Awesome but probably put me borderline diabetic by themselves :-)... Then went for the twisted potatoes... Awesome and great compliment to the beer ... Then had the seasonal berry salad ... Oh man that dressing is disgusting! If your sensitive to the vinegar taste don't even try it.  I ordered it without it, substituting it for the jalepeno dressing ... But came out with both... Ugh so soggy..... I ended the meal with the salted caramel pretzels... Went great with the bottled shock top pumpkin ale complimented by with cinnamon and sugar coated glass...

Ally H.,"Winter Park, FL",74,28,1,4.0,12/21/2010,This place has some of the nicest servers of anywhere in the area. The food is really good. I've never been a huge Applebees fan but this place is one of my faves for Riverhead restaurant choices. As a visitor in the area I have found most servers at most other places to be quite rude and inattentive. These servers and staff are friendly and make you feel welcome and that adds ratings in my book.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2?start=20

Colton C.,"Shrewsbury, MA",168,155,53,5.0,4/15/2017,"I had a REALLY good experience here last night with my fiancé. You can't go wrong with the 2 for $20 deal here. We had a very nice woman as our server and the restaurant was pretty busy. However, she was attentive to our needs and very nice to us!  We got their wings with the Asian Chile sauce. Always my favorite: sweet but with that yummy signature ""Asian"" hot sauce.  I ordered the firecracker shrimp cavatappi! SO GOOD. The sauce wasn't like Mac and cheese which surprised me in a good way: it had almost a teriyaki flavor but also with veggies and lime taste! Really good. Also, the shrimp was super crispy! Loved it.  My fiancé ordered the caprese burger, which is new. It was cooked medium rare, which is how he ordered it, and pretty good! A little bland, but hey it was lots of cheese and tomato on a burger and that was it. ;)  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2
Ashley W.,"Islip Terrace, NY",87,3,2,1.0,10/16/2017,"WORST service EVER. If I could give 0 stars I would. Went to this location with my daughter and my friend with her daughter as well, both 2 years old we got there around 7pm. Our waitresses name was Tracy. She took the kids orders and the food came out promptly, she than took our orders. When my daughter received her food(macaroni & cheese and apple slices with yogurt) Her macaroni was DRY as could be, almost seemed like it was made the night before or early in the day and heated up. I asked Tracy who barley ever came to check up on us to sub it out with chicken tenders because it was disgusting. She brings the plate of chicken tenders with no frys because my daughter got the apple slices from the previous meal. When she came back to the table to give me the nuggets she slid them on the table with an attitude and walked away. Anyways, we waited 45 minutes for our food to come after our kids were already said and done with theirs. I asked for a manger from a random employee because our waitress sucked and was to busy walking PAST us and socializing with it seemed like she knew customers at the bar. He came over, I explained that its ridiculous that we have been waiting 45 minutes for our meal and our kids are already done eating. I was about ready to leave. He offered to give the kids free ice cream and free games on the tablets which was nice but that was not acceptable for the experience that we had. All of a sudden our food was MAGICALLY READY once the manager was involved being that it came out .2 seconds later. Tracy was the worst waitress I've ever had in a restaurant before. She did not pay attention to her tables and her personality sucked! As a matter of fact when the manager walked away to get the girls ice cream the table in front of us in tracys section as well complained that they have been waiting for their check. DONT EVER COME TO THIS LOCATION! MANAGEMENT AND STAFF SUCK! I will also be calling corporate! Ive always been a customer of Applebee's and this one by far is HORRIBLE!

Jon S.,"Phoenix, AZ",431,140,206,3.0,7/31/2016,The experience eating here is like being a lab rat in a marketing research laboratory.  The table has a HUGE display at one end with 10 or more slots with marketing cards stacked in them with deals and specials.  The table also has some electronic display on a movable stand that is partly used to display even more deals and specials...but ultimately to entice youngsters to play video games....for which the parents will have to pay an additional fee. Add to all of this the parrot like marketing ploys that come out of the waitresses who offer specials.... and you have a marketing card at the end of the table that says if they don't offer the specials........ you get a free appetizer.   Instead of just having a nice place to relax and enjoy your families comfort and food... you really feel assaulted by it all. The food was good...standard applebees fare.  I hope the one near my house doesn't do this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2
Qi G.,"New York, NY",298,243,226,1.0,4/27/2016,"I came here after Outlet shopping without much expectations, as this is a chain restaurant. However, the service was EXCEPTIONALLY bad. When we asked our waitress if the appetizers were half off, she looked at us, rolled her eyes and said, ""Uh, that's why everybody's here."" (I KID YOU NOT) Pointing to the people sitting in the restaurant. She took our orders after repeating them and came back with boneless instead of bone in wings. We politely pointed out that she had gotten our order wrong and she admitted it, ""Yes, I'll take this back and have them make you bone in wings."" 20 minutes later, after we had already finished our meal and the wings were still not up, we asked to cancel the order and get the check instead. ""Well, I already put it in the system. I can pack the wings for you in the back and you can take it to go."" she responded matter of factly. The look she gave us was as if she just didn't want to be there. She came back 10 minutes later with our wings without an apology whatsoever for making us wait so long.  I have never paid a bill without tipping and this was my first. Applebees shouldn't hire teenagers. The service was terrible and we got a stuck up teenage waitress with an attitude. If possible, I would give this place 0 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-riverhead-2
Daniel G.,"Brooklyn, NY",97,64,91,3.0,7/20/2015,"It was a standard visit with some highlights on the service. The people at the front desk were very sweet and welcoming and the waitress that served us took our orders timely and with ease.  It's always hard to grade a place like this because the food is just simple, the service is simple, the whole concept of this place is just simple. This place is a High Calorie guzzler and for the quality of there food it's not worth it. No need to gain 1000+ calories on drenched salad and salty meats.  With that all said the orders where taken properly and the food was expedited on time. Can't ask for more from a place like this.  Ps. Vegetarians stay away... And don't order the drinks.

They said they enjoyed working there etc, but happened to divulge some pretty DISGUSTING information about the place. Have you ever seen the movie ""Waiting.."" ? According to my friend, and ex employee, this Applebees is a mirror of that movie.... What I'm saying is. If your order is extra difficult, or if you give the staff any problems at all (complaining about your food, etc) they will mess with the food you order. For example: apparently one time a table was being difficult, being very specific with their orders and a bit snippy to the waiter. So what this annoyed waiter did was took the ginger ale soda they ordered, and before giving it to the table, snuck it to the restroom and literally urinated a bit in the cup. Disgusting right? And my friend, ex employee, said this stuff happened ALL the time at this Applebees. I don't think I need to explain any other incidents, but my friend told me a bunch of things the staff here does regularly if you annoy them at all with your service.
