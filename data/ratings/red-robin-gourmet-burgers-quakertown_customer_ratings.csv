24,Frank S.,"Quakertown, PA",3,28,2.0,3.0,2012-01-19,"I have eaten at Red Robin many times at various locations.  I enjoy their burgers, my favorite is the Royal Red Robin burger. It comes with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, lettuce & tomato on top. They will bring you as many fries as you like. I usually ask for extra fries when I order in the beginning and they will you bring you a basket full. They put loads of salt on the fries so I always ask for no salt on them.  The wait staff is always upbeat & friendly.  My biggest peeve with them is how they seat you.  Most times I go for lunch and am almost always alone.  I take my news paper and treasure my lunch time reading the paper. They always try to seat me at the smallest table possible and that makes it hard to read the paper. I feel like I have to beg them for a bigger booth. I understand if it is a busy time but I take lunch between 11:00 & 11:30 and there are never many people in there.  Thats why I gave them 3 stars instead of 4.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown?start=20,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
18,Tori B.,"Perkasie, PA",126,95,25.0,4.0,2013-10-20,"I love Red Robin. When we want to go to one, we always come here.The food is good, the fries are awesome, burgers as well. My mom got one dish that had some shrimp on it and she said it was extremely greasy, so much it made her stomach hurt later that evening. Other than that, my whole other family's meals were awesome. The towering onion rings are the best, just a head ups. The waitresses are very friendly, patient and attentive. Great service over-all. Though, last time we came here with a family of 4, the price was around $60. Now, came here a few days ago getting the same stuff we usually do, the price seemed to have raised to $80? Not sure why it become more pricey other than having these tablets at the table and the new designs of them serving the food. The wait on a Friday and Saturday is usually pretty long. You might be sitting there for an 30-45 minutes.  Overall, the place get a 4 for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
20,Julia M.,"Coopersburg, PA",21,7,5.0,4.0,2014-01-05,"Red Robin is probably my favorite chain restaurant in our area. The food is always excellent. I have tried many things on the menu all of which, I enjoyed to the fullest. Red Robin has the best burgers around but that's not all they're good for! Their wraps are sensational, their crispy chicken sandwich is extremely tasty and their fries are always perfect. Their red robin seasoning that is given to each table is unlike anything else!  The service at Red Robin never fails me. The servers are alert, friendly, and on top of things. I can tell they have been trained very well. One employee in particular, a server by the name of Megan, is just delightful! It is always an enjoyable experience for me and I look forward to dining there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
17,Cas M.,"Chalfont, PA",162,120,52.0,3.0,2014-01-21,"As far as chains go, it is what it is. Bottomless fries are pretty cool, and the Red Robin seasoning provided for your table to use on them is great. I got a chicken caesar wrap, which was only alright and not good enough to finish or take home. It was drenched in dressing, which to me is unappetizing. I did like the spinach tortilla it was wrapped in, though! Other than that, most of the food is typical greasy burger joint food.  I do not like the concept of a tablet with games at the table. Not that you HAVE to use it, but it is a temptation for children or adolescents when you are out for dinner with the family. The whole point of going out with whoever is to experience togetherness while enjoying a meal you don't have to cook at home. It drives me nuts when people (of any age!) bring electronics to the dinner table. Not the time or place! The prices are fair. The service, to me, seems slow and distracted, but I guess only because the few times I went were all days that RR was packed. This place gets entirely too crowded on weekends and holidays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown,,,,,

15,Robert G.,"North Wales, PA",1,71,314.0,4.0,2014-06-04,"Been coming here for some time now. Very good variety of Burgers. Staff is always energetic. I am sure there are better places for gourmet burgers, but this place feeds the need for something quick, but a bit healthier than McDonalds.  Their burgers come out pretty taste and juicy and usually cooked to the temperature that you requested. They have many different appetizers and sides and sauces.  They are reasonably priced for what you get and you'll usually leave this place with a full belly and lots of regret.  Highly recommend their Bonsai Burger (with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce),  tower of onion rings and humus dip appetizer. Their cole slaw is pretty good as well. If you are in the mode for something quick, tasty and meaty, this place will not disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown,,,,,
22,Stephanie K.,"Slatington, PA",18,71,39.0,3.0,2014-07-12,"So disappointed. Sat at the bar. The waitress was prompt with our bar drinks. When it came time to order I said to her that I want pretzels and soup as my meal. She grabbed the ziosk, then told me she already sent the pretzels in. My boyfriend ordered the royal red robin burger. A few min passed by and the pretzels came out. I wanted that for part of my meal. Not an app. That disappointed me. The soup was ok. It was a little to watery. They chum the soup, so the water to mixture was off. Just not the best experience. Also the waiter Dan was incredibly rude to the hostess, who you can see has some mental health issues. He was just cruel in the way he spoke to her in front of guests. Also the bartenders just complained. It wasn't enjoyable. This location has gone down hill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown?start=20,,,,,

11,Warren R.,"Wind Gap, PA",918,254,1114.0,3.0,2014-09-30,"I had the D.B.G. and it was pretty good. "" The D. B. G.  Oven roasted tomatoes, savory roasted garlic aioli and fresh arugula tosses in citrus olive oil dressing on a toasted ciabatta bun. 12.99"" It had a very unique taste to it and I enjoyed it to an extent. I like the more traditional burger taste and the D.B.G. didn't really have that taste so if you're looking for that type of burger you won't get it with this one but it is good.    We had a nice waiter and service was good but stay away from the little electronic thingamajig in each table. I played a game while I was waiting and it charged me dang near $2 for a short trivia  game. I didn't know this until the bill came. It plays songs to but at 99¢ a song they can keep their songs. But it's really convenient to pay your bill with the same machine. Just swipe you card down the side and its paid.

12,P. M. W.,"Ambler, PA",26,215,,2.0,2015-08-24,"Food was just okay, interior was nice and lively.  Burger a little beefy, chicken a little chewy, fries a bit undercooked. Service was poor and slow.  And to rub salt into the poor service, there are electronic tablets on the tables presumably to make getting items faster...  One can order more food or drinks or ask for one's servers attention.  This didn't work.  We requested our server (who kept forgetting to bring flatware and napkins) but she didn't come.  It wasn't busy in the restaurant.  No one came, just a flashing red light on top of the tablet kept flashing, so lonely, so unnoticed.  Even the manager came around, saw the flashing red light, smiled at us, and walked away.  We eventually asked the server for the check, and she said we pay at the table, and walked away.  It was convenient to pay on the tablet and get out of there fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown,,,,,

Last order was the first time that the car side to go didn't force us to go inside to pay and get out order. It was nice to see the service work the way it was intended to.  Food is ok.

The tables were so close on either side that we were pretty much at the same table.

8,Colin G.,"East Greenville, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-11,"Honestly, I've been to his restaurant dozens of times over the last several years.  Including dining in and using their curbside to go service.  Unfortunately the last 3 times we've dined in our experience has been terrible.  From the ridiculously slow service to rude waiters and waitresses, it's really a shame how bad this particular restaurant has become over this past year.  Our worst experience how ever was last night when we placed a curbside to go order for 2 burgers.  I arrived a few minutes before I was told my order would be ready but had to park next to the curbside to go spots along with another customer waiting for pickup because the only 2 spots they have were taken.  Not a big deal, however when an employee finally came out to the cars she only approached one while ignoring the 3 other cars.  After 10 minutes one car pulled out of the to go spots so I was able to pull in.  I waited more than 25 minutes for another employee to come out.  This time it was a young man who still ignored me and the other car that had been parked outside the spots.  Another 10 minutes passed and finally someone came out and asked my name.  He went in to get my food.  After 10 more minutes passed he brought the food out.  Of course it was cold because I ordered over an hour ago.  I kindly asked for it to be remade so we could actually have a fresh dinner that we were paying for.  After 15 minutes, a manger came out to me with a small cup of French fries and basically have any excuse as to why there has been an issue.  By the time my food finally came out, I had been parked for 1 hour 20 minutes.  In a rush to get the food home I didn't bother to check my order.  So after a 10 minute drive I arrived home only to find out that my order was completely wrong.  Thanks for nothing.   Obviously we won't be returning to this Red Robin location and probably have given up on the entire chain due to this pathetic attempt at service.   Do yourself a favor and don't bother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-quakertown,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
