Aubrey W.,"Washougal, WA",28,287,4,4.0,2/8/2007,"In the world of restaurants I rate most TGI Fridays as about 3 stars. However, this one way exceeded my expectations. We stopped in here about 10 monutes after happy hour had ended. Luckily, due to our awesome waitress happy hour kept on going for us. Discount appetizers and drinks gave us a feast for kings...I mean queens. We practically rolled ourselves out of the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-palm-desert
Bob N.,"Palm Desert, CA",1,31,3,1.0,1/18/2011,"This restaurant is closed and has been for years!  If intentionally horrible service can kill a restaurant, then this restaurant murdered itself.  So bad, so really intentionally bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-palm-desert
