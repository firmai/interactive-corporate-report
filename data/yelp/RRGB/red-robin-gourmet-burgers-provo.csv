Josh N.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",142,8,,4.0,12/19/2017,The food was good and so was our service. The waitress gave me a great recommendation and so I ordered the madlove burger. It was delicious and the bottomless fries were fantastic.  The only downside was I thought this place was a little bit pricey.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo
Vickie J.,"Orem, UT",37,153,27,1.0,9/5/2017,"Horrible service and even worse food. This is one of my all time worse places I've ever eaten at. We were a group of six. Four adults and two kids. I don't plan on ever eating at any Red Robin anywhere. Yeah, it was that bad! When we were seated, I had to brush the seat cushion off just to sit down. This should've been my clue that we should just turn around and leave. First the good, then the bad. The shakes were good and the side salad was cold, crisp and the dressing was tasty. Tower of onion rings were ok. They were warm'ish but we didn't have any napkins, silverware or plates. We ended up getting our own napkins so we could eat the onion rings. Yep, that's it for the good. When our meals came we had to ask for silverware. Some of our food was warm but nothing was hot.  Deep fried pickles. Gross. They were dripping with grease and then they weren't even warm. Fries weren't fresh and tasted like they had been sitting for awhile. The worst food was the kids meal grilled chicken. My granddaughter ate a couple of pieces and said it tasted bad. We smelled it and you could obviously tell it was spoiled chicken. We had our server smell it and she agreed it smelled terrible. She brought mac and cheese as a replacement. Bad chicken can KILL YOU. It's not as simple as just getting another meal. By this time, I had pretty much had it. Both the grandkids were crying about what a terrible experience this was. We were celebrating our grandson's birthday so it was so sad. This is the Reader's Digest version of this horrible restaurant but you get the idea. I will never go back here to eat. It was the worst experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo
Erin L.,"American Fork, UT",30,97,160,3.0,12/3/2017,"This is a good and safe burger joint. They changed up the decor a little since I've been there, fun for kids though, especially with plane and go cart hanging from the ceiling. Don't go there is you want to have a conversation with group of people because it gets noisy. Ordered the guacamole burger. Toppings were evenly laid out and burger was well done. Great sweet potato fries and yes they still serve bottomless regular steak fries. They are generous with the shakes because they give you the shake with toppings and the second cup half full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo
Emma J.,"Ogden, UT",26,4,,2.0,12/22/2017,"I used to go to Red Robin ALL THE TIME! The food has always been decent and at some times amazing! Good service and everything was good! But the past two times I've dined there were it for me. One of the times I ordered a water and as I was drinking it I noticed little things floating in the water, I looked closer and noticed there was remnants of a shake in there, there was still pieces of ice cream floating around in the cup and on the side of the cup. I just figured it was a little mishap and ignored it and just didn't drink the rest of the water.  I came back again a few months later to give them another chance, and sure enough my water comes to the table, I start drinking it, and about halfway through I noticed what had to be pieces of olives floating in my water! Soggy black chunks in my water! I was super grossed out and paid for my meal and left. Not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo

Dick N.,"Springville, UT",42,75,74,4.0,11/7/2016,"I have been to this location a number of times.  I am not sure why I don't go more, but I can't seem to place this in the five star location.   First is what I like.  the food is good, I like the atmosphere, and the servers are really nice.  I do miss a few items off the menu that they have removed, and a few that they added were not as good as what came off, but oh well.  I got the smoke and pepper burger.  It was ok, nothing great, and did not taste like pepper at all.  That was a big downer because that is what the burger was known for.  Other than that it was like what I could get at home.  The downside of this place.  Crap, way to crowded.  In the section I was in they need to pull a table.  Seriously folks, if I am at the resteraunt don't make me have to move so people and waiters can get by.  Don't make the walkways so tight that it is a tricky walk for people to walk behind me.   On another note I am not sure why we had two big plastic catsups at our table, and at the one next to us, and next to that.   Pros: Clean, nice staff.  Cons:  Food is ok, not sure if it is as good as the price, too crowded with tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo

We dont have a red robins and going to red robins whether it be Utah or California has normally been a good experience. However our table was all the way in corner looks like the kid section on a non busy friday afternoon, our table was not clean, plates were dirty, I asked the hostess to sweep under our table as it was outrageously dirty crayons and food everywhere! She took a while but eventually came over and swept although not very well. Will never come to this red robins ever again and if you are thinking about coming to this location please don't!

Where I'm from Hawaii Red Robin is so far away 1hr 45mins one way. Anyways when I first arrived the host greeted us and asked how many is in my party. I came with a party of three and was told the wait would be 15mins. While we waited we just walked around the mall. When we got seated our waiter ""not sure his name"" but he introduced himself and asked what we would like to drink. We immediately knew he was from Australia because the way he talked. We talked for a while about Australia and how we have family in Sydney. We loved his vibes and attitude! We ordered our food and waited for about 15 mins.

We where not given the option the large open         Patio- it just seemed like a nuisance to seat us          there w/ our huge party of 4. -   2. After waiting 10 minutes we finally got a waiter         Which is really not a big deal cause I love the           extensive menu. +/-   3.  Asked for a Guinness in a non chilled glass got           a can Guinness with chilled glass. Oh well            I should know better than to go to a              Restaurant in Provo on Sunday much less              Order alcohol.   4.  The waiter was so damn grumpy I though            Someone may have punched his Mother or             Girlfriend (see above Sunday in Prove) hell it               felt like we had sat down in his house and                we were an intrusion 5.   Corporation is tightening belt or sumpin            Buns on all items where greasy and second              rate unlike the old ones nothing was cooked              to order                 now come in a metal container limiting                  the amount and ""bottomless"" LMAO the                   server just avoided us until he came over                     and asked about Dessert                    grudgingly he took the Dessert order and                     left.

All food was mediocre and smaller in quality         S'more expensive though.  The only reason I did not give one star is because the food is palatable and I have been going to one RR or another for over 20 years with good memories. Uncharacteristic of me I gave the waiter less than 10% which is the Provo norm.  To bad for him as I tip fat for good or even mediocre service it's a good thing he got that Dessert order in- what a putz.

We were greeted by two managers when we came in, James and Rachel, both of whom continued to check up on us during the evening. Our server, Carlos, was pretty slammed, but he checked on us as often as possible given the number of people he was waiting on and was quite pleasant.

It isn't a restaurant I would choose but my wife ordered the Black and Blue Burger which was dry and over cooked. Anytime you order a burger and they don't ask you, 'How do you want that cooked?' just know it's coming out well done.

Shannon T.,"Midvale, UT",15,41,24,1.0,2/12/2017,Food was awful and slow. Half of our table got their burgers but one person waited an additional 20 minutes for a basic cheese burger. Ice tea had no ice...twice. Fries cold. Lots of open tables but still a 15 minute wait.

Chase B.,"Provo, UT",45,80,29,4.0,4/20/2017,"I know it's not kosher to rate chains high among yelpers, but this place is my guilty pleasure. I love to come here and get the Red's Tavern Burger, which runs at under $8, and get one or two extra servings of fries with their bottomless fry deal. The fry sauce has a BBQ tinge to it here that I really love. The lemonades aren't bad and the service has been adequate.

We went on a Friday night around 8:00pm, the wait was 45 minutes for a party of two. Thankfully the bar was open, so we walked right up and ordered and ate our food there, disputes only drinking water. The service at the bar was quick compared to the rest of the restaurant, but because it was so busy the service was a little chaotic and still took a while. We never got a refill on our bottomless fries (or even offered a refill...) and it took 10+ minutes to get the check, and another 5+ for a to-go box.

They puts us next to the window looking at the patio our server couldn't have walked outside maybe 10 ft to the table on the patio.  The customer service isn't high on the totem pole at Red Robin. It was cold inside they gave us a brand new server that forgot everything but she tried to make up for it.

James D.,"St George, UT",144,14,1,5.0,10/18/2016,"I was visiting Provo last week while my Dodgers were in the NLCS. My hotel room didn't have the game's broadcast, so I searched for a restaurant with some TV's. I've always enjoyed Red Robin, so decided to give it a shot. I asked to be sat in front of a TV playing the Dodger's game. I was along and expected to be sat at a bar or a small table. Instead, they sat me at a table for four people. However, it was perfectly pointed right at a TV with the game playing. My server (I think his name was Blake) took my order, but his first question was whether the view was good. I ordered a burger with bottomless fries and root beer float. I warned him that I was planning on sticking around a while, and he had to objection to the idea. The burger was great, as always. The fries kept coming and coming, as promised. As did the root beer floats. I don't think I finished a single one without another one appearing in front of me. I cheered on my team and witnessed one of the best games I've ever seen in my life!! Blake kept coming around and asking if I wanted more food, and to see how my team was going. Not once did I feel rushed to leave. Even after I over-did my stay, the bottomless foods kept coming until I told them to stop in fear of me exploding. Whenever I think of Red Robin, I've always thought about their wonderful service. I think only once I received mediocre service, but it has otherwise been spot on and exceeded expectations. I love their seasoning, I've purchased them before at a decent price. I love using them on burgers and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo

The food was not good either. Normally I love Red Robin, but the fish was bland, chicken strips were so dry and hard, and our fries were hard.

Brian W.,"Vineyard, UT",113,84,64,2.0,10/3/2015,"This red robin is the slowest one we have ever been to. They are always busy but refuse to take reservations. You will get there around dinner time and ask for a table and they will say 30 to 45 min. And it will take them a hour and 10 to be seated.  When you ask them for more fries. Or for fries while you wait for your food, they make it a huge fuss every time and tell you some excuse like ""our kitchen is behind today"" or ""I can see what I can do"" aka they will maybe bring you a basket with 10 fries to split. And they are usually slow about bringing them out. People come for the fries. If they were smart, they would be prepared with extra fries. I have been to 6 or 7 different red robins and have never had a problem.  I had gotten a bacon cheese burger with guacamole and asked for no tomato or lettuce. It came out with both, when I asked them to fix it they took it in the back and when they brought it back to me you could clearly tell they just took it in the back and took them off to bring back to me(against health code) and then also most of my guacamole was scraped off my burger. It's a joke there.  The only reason I give it two stars is because they have good food like all red robins. Or else I would give them 1 star. They make it seem like they would rather get you in and out but can't seem to do it.

The fact that everyone who comes in practically has bottomless steak fries is both great and terrible; great because they are so damn good, and terrible because of the health factor that goes into the risk of bottomless steak fries. I've been to this specific location multiple times, and the staff has always been great! Super friendly and really gets to know the people who they are serving. Many of the servers have been here for 2+ years, so I'm sure management must be doing something right! I've never been unhappy with the food, and I usually get the chicken strips or the garden burger- both are done really well!

I LOVE the cookie milkshake so freaking tasty. You'll need to work out after you eat here haha but the servers are super friendly too. Make sure you have a more full bottle of their signature blend seasoning because of it's almost empty the smoke flavor falls to the bottom and it isn't as good/mixed well. Salads.... Not their forte... So wouldn't recommend those here... If you want one don't waste your money... Just get a side salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo?start=40

Waitress did not write down our order then after a longer than normal wait brought out our food. My husband's burger was wrong, and i was brought a burger despite ordering chicken. Then when attempting to correct my husband's food they brought it out now missing ingredients. Just did not seem like she was listening and did not take any notes to go off of, then had a very off-put attitude. Food itself, mac and cheese would not order again. It was just a bowl of oiled or buttered noodles with a pile of partially melted cheese in the middle. Whiskey river chicken sandwich the crispy onions and bun was soggy making it hard to eat, but overall taste was fine. My husband royal red burger once fixed was good but the egg was overdone and a bit greasy. Chocolate Malt was delicious. My husband was disappointed with bottomless fries because our waitress never returned so he could get more than his initial serving.

Dallin J.,"Alpine, UT",8,2,,1.0,2/25/2017,"we walk in to the establishment to be greeted with what sounded like a thousand screaming children. the music was loud and horrible. every single table was either flooded with sunlight or pitch black. i nearly tripped on my way over to my seat, but luckily the sticky floor made it easy to keep my footing. the hosts and servers were smug and smelly. the air was cold. me and my fat polar bear wife were freezing our H-E-double toothpicks off. we came for the ""bottomless fries"" that we had heard so much about. we ordered a burger and fries and the food arrives in about 45 minutes. meanwhile the television is showing D-League basketball in crappy resolution. i felt like i was in the waiting room at a jiffy lube. our waiter was visibly sweaty and muttering obscenities under his breath. he was extremely out of shape and judgmental. even more than my wife. he came to us with our food and proceeded to couch on it and give a pathetic smile and mumble as an apology. then he coughed on it again. he stumbled away awkwardly and kicked a veteran's shattered knee on his way to the kitchen. naturally we started inspecting the food. they put mustard on it. we scarfed down the fries like the rabid animals we are. and now we were waiting for our refill of the BOTTOMLESS fries. IT NEVER CAME. my wife was angry. so naturally we started yelling at each other. then the waiter came back spilled a malt on my bare foot. and i have some pretty big feet, mind you. i barked at the waiter and demanded a refund. he demanded pension. it was a standoff. it may as well have been high noon. i had his pension and he had refill. ""where are my fries?"" i demanded my fries. he responded by saying ""i'm already is."" no lie. the fries are apparently bottomless because the three inch tin they come in has no bottom. i am on nine prescription medications. in summary i dont like red robin and i dont like the american dream. hope this review helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo?start=40

Joshua R.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,1.0,8/24/2015,"We have been (and still are) fans of Red Robin; this Provo location is not exceptionally bad, but rather consistently mediocre and moderately bad in the several visits we have had.  We lived in Las Vegas (actually Henderson) for 5 years and there were two locations nearby us, one that was always great, the food would come out hot and well prepared, service was generally good, and then there was the other location (like the Provo location).  We would intentionally drive the extra 5-10 min to the better location, unfortunately we do not have that option in Provo. As this has been our experience, tonight will probably be the last time we visit this location.  I had the new überburger (that doesn't even compare to the Oktoberfest burger a few years ago) and my wife had the smoke and pepper burger - both of our sandwiches were room temperature, the fries were cool, and worst of all flavor was boring.  This has been our experience here the last few times as previously mentioned. Wait times here are atrocious, 15-20 minutes waiting to be seated, then another 22 minutes to get our cooled down food (I started a timer on my phone the moment we placed the order).  Two times ago we actually watched other people get seated, order food, get their food, and one table finished before our food came (we had a different waiter than the tables we were watching).

We placed our order when our waiter brought our drinks out, and sat, and sat, and sat. All of the tables around ours received their food prior to ours, and they had ordered after we did! It literally took 25 minutes to receive our food and our waiter blamed it on the fact that my wife ordered a gluten-free item. ""It takes longer as we have to clean the spatulas, etc..."".

You used to be able to order a milkshake AND also get the leftover in a tin can for $3. It's now been raised to $4.50.  My real complaint, though, is that I recently ordered the Red's Tavern Double. The menu says it's made of ""classic-sized"" patties. I took that to mean Red Robin classic size. Nope! Their Tavern Double is as small as McDonald's double cheeseburger...except you're paying 3 times the amount. My burger was literally less than half the size of everyone else's at the table.

He actually said to us ""If I get around to it."" And ""I'll try."" After asking him four times, we asked him what his deal was and he explained to us that there was a new policy put into place restricting servers from bringing guests fries before they get their Entree. What? We asked for a manager (But not before getting some major sass from this Marc guy) and she explained to us that there was no such policy and she apologized for our waiters bad/lazy attitude. We mentioned we come to Red Robin often and probably wouldn't go out of our way to return in the future and Marc said ""I don't care. Fine by me.""

All of the veggies were limp; not fresh since they were cooked under the lamp, and the fries were hard (like a raw potato).  The manager came and apologized and stated he felt bad about the delay and offered to give us a discount, but it was never applied to our receipt.  The server was great, but the food was disgusting and over-priced (which is saying a lot as it only cost about $9 per dinner).  I would not recommend this place to anyone. BAIT & SWITCH: As for their ""bottom-less Fries""- they serve you about 5-10 fries at a time, but only if you ask for them and only if you want to wait. In fact, the server never returned to fulfill on this 'offer'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo?start=80
Edward D.,"Santaquin, UT",4,131,8,4.0,3/8/2015,"Love this place.  It's not really as convenient as going to other fast food places.  But, like many others have stated, it's a terrific place.  I too love their frys.  I think sometimes they could be a bit more generous with the refills, but just keep'em coming and I'll  be happy.  The restaurant is a bit loud, but it doesn't  keep me from coming  back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo?start=80
Alan B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",57,59,2,3.0,2/25/2011,"In my opinion, the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap is the one thing that separates Red Robin's from the countless other dime-a-dozen burger peddlers out there. It sticks out from that humdrum menu like a sore (but tasty) thumb. There used to be two other outstanding menu items: The Carnitas burger, and the Baja turkey club. But these mysteriously disappeared from the menu a few months back. When we asked the waitperson about this, she gesticulated in an animated fashion and expressed that she had been surprised to see those go; they had apparently been quite popular. Bah. The Nuclear Iced Tea is also quite nice if you fancy a strong cocktail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo?start=80

Chris S.,"Boise, ID",35,149,,3.0,10/20/2010,"Now I normally don't review chain restaurants.  There are two reasons for that.  First of all, you should know what to expect when you walk into a chain.  The food will be the same.  The decor will be (mostly) the same.  The only thing that really varies is the service.  So there isn't much to be said that you shouldn't already know before you walk in the door.  The second reason is more personal bias.  I don't like eating at chain restaurants and do so only when I really don't have much other choice.  I fully encourage everyone to support locally owned and operated restaurants whenever possible.   So why am I reviewing this Red Robin then?  Because I told myself I would review all the restaurants I ate at on this trip, and I intend to stay true to that intention.  With that said, here we go. Service:  5/5 We arrived early in the afternoon on a Wednesday and we had the place entirely to ourselves.  The hostess greeted us promptly, we were seated right away, and served quickly.  They explained some of the new items on the menu to us, as well as currently running specials.  Overall we had nothing to complain about in terms of the service.   Food:  3/5 Ok, I'll be honest here.  There was nothing WRONG with the food, it's just very pedestrian.  They claim their burgers are something spectacular, but frankly I've had much better burgers at a lot of different places.  We had a queso dip appetizer and it also was just very average.  In my opinion, it is a little bit overpriced as well.  The food simply isn't as good as they claim it should be, or what they charge for it.  At the end of the day, it is simply average all the way around. Overall Impressions:  4/5 The restaurant was clean, well maintained, and the decor was nice.  I'm not really into the whole ""50's retro"" look.  Frankly it doesn't really match up with their menu in my opinion.  If they are going for the old ""burger stand"" vibe, the menu is a little too fancy for that.  Am I splitting hairs?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I'm biased against chain restaurants.  Hey, at least I'm honest about it. So why do they only get  three stars overall?  Well, Yelp says that at four stars ""I'm a fan.""  I'm not a fan.  If you need a burger and this place is there, you'll get a decent one.  But I would encourage you to find someplace better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo?start=80

Mike B.,"Somerville, MA",2,70,2,4.0,7/12/2012,"Okay, I decided that this place isn't so bad... when you're in the mood for that kind of place. And my wife and I were a couple days ago. So, even though we thought we probably wouldn't ever go back again, here we were. Learning from our mistakes however, we avoided the Friday night rush and the ciabatta bread. I got the burnin' love burger with a raspberry lemonade (which was surprisingly good). I still think the portion sizes are a too big -- I always walk out feeling like a whale and I don't want to drive home, but my wife makes me. Anyway it's not like the burgers make for good leftovers, so what you don't finish gets thrown away, and I hate throwing away food, so it's always a dilemma (idk, maybe that doesn't make sense to anyone).

Erin Q.,"Austin, TX",24,181,2,3.0,1/22/2008,"I've been to Red Robin several times in Provo, and each time it has pretty much been the same. Nothing too exceptional, but good enough to keep me coming back. Unfortunately, I decided to go on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day when the teeny high school kids decided to linger at the mall all day while the snow poured down. The place was packed, but we were seated rather quickly. The service was good at best. I waited a good 20 minutes for my Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap. The wrap was good, but not as good as expected. I'll likely order it again, but not before I order a classic Red Robin Cheeseburger. The endless steak fries really make the trip, especially with their fry seasoning and some ranch dressing. If you choose to go with a dessert, I definitely recommend the Mile High Mud Pie. Definitely meant for more than one person, this thing is so good. And overall the price of Red Robin isn't poor at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo?start=100
