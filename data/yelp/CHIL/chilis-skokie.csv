Annie V.,"Chicago, IL",240,132,346,4.0,1/29/2016,"4 stars for my recent visit. The staff were friendly and attentive; the restaurant was clean, bathroom as well (I can't speak for the men's since I can't go in there!); the food was good.  I ordered the fajita trio- which you can choose 3 types of protein... It came with 3 flour tortillas, sour cream, guac, cheese, salsa, and tomatoes. It was very good! Meats were really tender and flavored so well--- I wasn't expecting that from Chili's! It fed the 2 of us adults with some to spare! It only costed $16.99. (The only thing I will say is that the presentation of the sides could've been a little more appetizing, and they could've given more tortillas or at least stop by and ask if we needed more tortillas... ) What was even better was we happen to come when kids eat free. So my daughter got her fave, grilled cheese, and her side choice of mashed potatoes. I tried the potato and it was so good it had to be artery clogging good. That's a good-bad thing   Bill with tax and tip came out to $25-and I didn't even have to wait for the server to give us our check. The tables have little tablets you can pay from! Good service & food, no waiting time, free meal--can't beat that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=20
Stephanie M.,"Skokie, IL",63,6,,5.0,6/19/2017,Just wanted to give a shout out to this Chili's.

Mark B.,"Evanston, IL",0,17,,4.0,4/14/2017,"I almost never write reviews of big chain restaurants, but I've been to this Chili's several times in the past few months because it's my son's new favorite restaurant and after half a dozen meals there I have some good things to say about it: 1) The staff currently running the place seem to really have their act together. There's usually a wait on weekend nights, but you're right in the middle of one of the last decent shopping centers on the north shore, so there's stuff to do and see while you wait, and they'll just text you when your table is ready, which I thought was a convenient and handy touch. The place is clean and well-appointed and there are always plenty of staff on hand to direct traffic, clean tables and places, seat guests, and take orders. Their attentiveness is broadly excellent by any standard, which was one of the first things I noticed because it's usually what's missing in chain restaurants like this. 2) The drinks and orders come out quickly and correctly every single time, despite the fact that they do get very busy at peak mealtimes. For me, this translates once more into strong management and staff that know what they're doing. Their teamwork seems smooth and seamless when shift changes or unexpected things like large parties show up and land on them. No one ever seems stressed or quietly irritated, and a couple of occasions we even got a friendly conversation with our servers who made a good show of treating us like we were the only table in the place for those five minutes. When you work at full-speed, as these folks do, that kind of adaptability, professionalism, and consistency is almost like a magic trick.  3) They have these little iPad things for kids to play with at their meals and on which you can pay your bill directly instead of having the waitstaff take your card. It's convenient enough for what it is, and my son certainly appreciates the distraction and games, but the only star I'm taking off for this review is that these things cost $1.99 to use every time. It's not horrible, and I buy it every time for my kid, but I'd much rather give the servers the extra $2 for the great job they're doing than feel like I'm renting a piece of technology we have a better one of at home. Know what I mean? Just buy a couple dozen of these things and eat the cost and let us bask in the superb flow of the place without a $1.99 frowny face on the bill. 4) The food is mostly consistent with other Chili's restaurants, but it's only positives here too. They never scrimp on anything, seasonings really grab you, plates generously overflow, empty bowls of salsa or other condiments are refreshed instantly and without having to be asked, the drinks are satisfyingly mixed and their drink menu has just the right amount of variety. Their lava cake threatens to give you diabetes, but you sweets-lovers will get this every time because it's delicious and the right size for two. Speaking of two: they offer a ""dinner for two"" one-price special where you pick a starter, mains, desert, and drinks. Totally worth it. Last time my wife and I had the half-rack of ribs and Margarita Grilled Chicken which were both delicious (the ribs especially), and I drank both of the included, salted house margaritas myself. Reasonably priced and perfect, and I left our attentive server a 30% tip with zero regrets.  In a way, this Chili's answers some interesting questions about what a restaurant with machine-enhanced service could look like, and I'm happy to report that it looks... good? Who would have thought? There still seems to be plenty of people in the kitchen and dining room, and if anything the little iPad things that can take orders and check you out free up the rest of the staff to just make your experience better. I would feel bad if that kind of tech cost anyone their job, regardless of how much convenience or efficiency it offered, and I didn't get the sense that that was the case at all at this Chili's. The verdict: keep up the great work, guys (especially whoever is managing this place). We'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=20
Marge F.,"Chicago, IL",4,10,,3.0,4/1/2017,"Well the food here is decent as well as their prices.  The experience itself had much to be desired.. went early on a Thursday so not many people there.  Waiter was nice but I think he was a bit frazzled cause I think he was the only server there.  My Strawberry Daiquiri was terrible, had salt around the rim and tasted awful.   When the waiter came back with a new drink I realized that the bartender most likely poured the drink in another glass w/o salt on the rim.   I put it on the edge of the table and said I just stick with water... no apologies, or asking what was wrong with the drink.  The management needs to run the business a bit better, probably not going back there any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=20
Bill F.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,1.0,1/12/2017,"My wife and I have Iowa ID's because that's where we're from, and we're temporary residents in IL, so they advise you to not change your ID unless you plan on becoming a permanent resident. You also cannot renew an Iowa ID until it expires, not before. You renew online and they send you a new one through the mail, your old one remaining valid until your new one arrives. We're both 24. The doorman was very nice, the waitress who seated us was nice, the manager tried his best to be nice, but in the end he kept saying his 'hands were tied' when they really were not. He 'couldn't' accept my wife's ID, even with my wife being 6 months older than me. If he would of scanned it, he would have seen it was a valid ID, but he said they don't have an ID scanner. That would have been fine, had the manager been sensible. Common sense should have gotten us through this whole situation, as I lay out below. 1) The ID had her age and birth date on it. Last I checked, going backwards in age when renewing an expired license isn't something the DMV offers. 2) If you thought it was fake, maybe then think, 'why would someone have a fake EXPIRED license?' who the hell would be that stupid? Furthermore, 'Why would a wife bring a fake expired license, while her husband brought a real non-expired license, right next to her?' Without a scanner, a fake ID with a non-expired date could easily pass your eye inspection, but our real IDs couldn't. Wait, oops, just my (6-month-older-than-me) wife's couldn't... 3) If you're going to have a policy on a manager checking all 'out-of-state' IDs, common sense tells us that having a manager with AT LEAST basic knowledge of how 'out-of-state' IDs work would be appropriate.  We left, but I came back in as we were walking away and calmly told the manager that I was going to leave this very review. He offered to buy us an appetizer, but that didn't make my wife feel any less degraded. I shook his hand and we left. We went to Binny's, used the same IDs to buy some whiskey and then went to Chipotle on McCormick, where we used the same IDs again to buy some beers while we ate. Binny's cards hard. Harder than anywhere. They accepted my wife's ID because it was real. Really wish this place would have seen that. It was freezing out, sleeting and we just wanted to enjoy a night out at someplace a step up from home, but it looks like we'd have been better off inside. For advice? Get a scanner, get some knowledge in out-of-state IDs, but most importantly? Be more human, and get some sensibility.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=20

Wren G.,"Harwood Heights, IL",46,4,,5.0,9/11/2016,"Our visit on Saturday Sept 10th during lunch.  It had been over a year since I had visit this location.  We had anticipated them being busy however there was no wait when coming in.  We were sat in the bar lounge having Rhianna as our server.  My boyfriend is always anxious when going out, but Rhianna made him feel very comfortable and relaxed.  She smiled as she spoke to us, her tone was very genuine and professional.  She had given us a few ideas on what to order and also recommended a few featured items on their new menu.  We shared a triple dipper app consisting of Southwest Egg Rolls, Honey Chipotle BBQ Wings and Cheddar Bites . . . OHH MY GOODNESS those Cheddar Bites were something I've never had, sooo delicious.  I ordered a carnitas burrito with grilled asparagus and bf ordered a Grilled Chicken Burrito with beans.  Loved all of the food, and the music. I noticed a great special for a $6 Old Timer Burger on Wednesdays so I guess I'll be coming back very soon.  I'd definitely recommend coming and sitting in Rhianna's section.   Thank you so much to the staff and management.  We had a lot of fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=20

chris k.,"Chicago, IL",63,53,4,2.0,4/6/2016,"What has happened to this Chili's over the past few years?   I had a craving for the fajitas, so we stopped in for dinner.   We were looking for our standby Potato Skins for an appetizer and evidently they didn't  make the cut on the reworked menu.  We passed on the appetizer and ordered.   Along with wanting fajitas, I also wanted soup, it seems the awesome cheddar broccoli is no longer on the menu either (after being on the menu since forever).  I opted for a cup of the cream of potato soup and that serving size was the smallest I'd ever seen in a restaurant, only about five spoonfuls in total.   it was busy and our entrees were delivered by a manager.  The fajitas were not sizzling as usual and the onions and peppers weren't cooked, just one step over raw.  The other entree, Monterrey Chicken, I was told was ""just ok""   Needless to say, it wasn't a great or even good experience.  I really looked forward to those fajitas, I've have had better ones at the TBK down the street",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=20
Steve H.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,41,,1.0,10/13/2016,Poor food and very poor service. We ordered the classic nachos. It consisted of 12 tortilla chips topped with cheese and a jalapeño slice for $10.  What a ripoff!  The waitress never came around for refills on our drinks. We also ordered the combo fajitas.

We both had a burger and we enjoyed it very much. However we both thought that the fries had way too much seasoning and I did not care for the garlic pickles ( I wished that there was a choice). The only thing that turned our experience off was that the waitress dropped off the check without asking her if we wanted anything else.

Bunny F.,"Lincolnwood, IL",0,4,,3.0,5/24/2017,"I think the food is really good and pretty affordable but, like other reviewers, I've noticed that the wait times are kind of excessive on weekends and sometimes even weekdays. The waitstaff seem overworked and usually food comes to the table with a long wait as well. One time my husband got upset because our drinks came late and then our appetizers were late and then our main entrees came out just a minute after our appetizers. He asked them to bring the entrees back to the kitchen and keep them warm so that we could enjoy our appetizers. If it weren't for the overworked waitstaff (and by the way I think they are doing the best that they can) I think this place would get mostly 5 star reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=20

Stephanie F.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2017,"By far the worst experience and service ever. First, ordered drinks and appetizers. Drinks came quick, appetizer however took 35 minutes to come out. Ridiculous! We told the manager we were ready to leave because it shouldn't have taken that long at all. Normally appetizers come out relatively quick. The waiter was apologetic and he comp'd the appetizer. After waiting 35 minutes for the appetizer when it came out we ordered our meals. Meals came out and instead of plates we were given our meals on trays! Yes trays! Ummmm what happened to the plates! Our meal was chicken crispers with fries. Chicken was not good tasted rubbery and they changed how they were made, corn on the cob was seasoned way to much like the seasoning jar opened up on our corn that we had to scrape it off with our knives. And the french fries were soggy. Needless to say very disappointed in our visit to chili's this evening. Will think twice before we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=40
Andre' C.,"Chicago, IL",13,3,,2.0,3/18/2016,"I actually like(d) this Chili's, been there many times before, without a problem.. til today.  Maybe I should chalk it up to it just being my 1st experience with the ""To Go"" side of the restaurant.   But it'll most likely be the last.   I ordered online at approximately 4:08 PM, to which they gave a 4:25 PM pick-up time.  I had a stop to make and I wanted to give ample time to have the food prepared when I got there, so I arrived at around 4:40 PM.  A guy at the register asked if I was there for a ""pick-up"" order, I said yes, he asked my name, I gave it, and he said he'd be right with me.  I sat down.  After sitting there trying to pass the time by entertaining myself with my phone, my battery eventually died.  So after watching servers and waitresses repeatedly pass me with drinks and enormous platters of food, I eventually asked a girl at the register calculating receipts if she could find out if my order was going to be ready.  She said sure, and I never saw her again.  After about 10 more minutes, I stopped another waitress to ask if she'd see about my order, she said ""sure no problem"".  Not long after that, a gentleman whom i assumed also placed an order online, came thru the door.  The girl who I'd stopped came back to me and said that someone was working on my order (Working on it, really???  It was suppose to be DONE 45 minutes ago!!!) and it would be out in ""like 30 seconds"".   The guy that had just got there, grabbed a menu and stared at it and stood there for maybe 7, then took out his wallet and was greeted by a girl who came to the register with a bag with 2 containers in it.  I figured it had to be mine because by this time I'd been sitting there for over 50 minutes.  But I was wrong.  She said a name, I stood up, I asked her to repeat it, she said it again... the order belonged to the guy at the door.  He pays, takes his food, and leaves.  The girl asks my name, and tell her, and she says my order is coming.  Another person with an online/phone order walks in.  Someone is at the register and the woman gives the name on her order.  Shortly after the girl comes back to the front with another bag.  I'm thinking 'this shit can't be happening again'.  I just sit and wait to see what happens.  The server looks at me and nods, as if to say ""your order is (FINALLY) ready"".  I get up, I pay, she asks if I want silverware, I say no.  Grab my food, and I leave.  It was 5:45 PM.  As i said previously, I got there at 4:40 PM.  Now... the hour long wait alone would piss most people off to point of asking for a manager, or possibly just saying ""F this place!"" And leaving, long before reaching the 60 minute mark.  But the thing that kills me is, how can u suggest a pick-up time, I get there 15 minutes AFTER, and I then wait ANOTHER hour+ to receive something that was suppose to be ready for pick up 15 minutes before I even got there???  I'll say, the guy that came in after me received his food in a much more timely manner.  I'm never one that likes to pull or play the race-card, because I feel people rely on it to heavily and are too quick to jump to that conclusion, when that isn't ALWAYS the case.  So altho that gentleman happened to be... ""fairer skinned"".. I won't do it in this case.  I just dont necessarily feel there was enough to support that claim.  I'll just say the service was absolutely ridiculous.  The food was good tho.  Which is the reason for 2 stars, instead of one. But as far as online or phone orders to this particular location, this is the 1st and last time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=40

Christina G.,"Chicago, IL",43,545,14,1.0,2/16/2015,"I've been to this Chili's many times over the years. I was always so-so on this place. Service is usually pretty friendly, food is fine and generally comes out pretty quick, and there's usually pretty ample parking. However, when I went there last Thursday, I had a terrible experience. Really, what it comes down to is that we were blatantly lied to, in the hopes of getting our business.  Let me explain. I had decided to meet a friend at the Buffalo Wild Wings in the same mall. When I arrived there, I was told the wait would be an hour. An hour wait? On a random Thursday night? No thanks. Before we even moved the car an inch to drive somewhere else, my friend called Chili's to see what their wait time was like. No wait at all, we were told. Come right in! That worked for us. We drove over to Chili's (which is maybe a block-ish from Buffalo Wild Wings, MAYBE). We arrived there no more than 2 minutes after the call was made. We walked in, and saw a ton of people waiting to be seated. What? How could that be? My friend walked up to the host, who was CLEARLY the gentleman who had answered the call, and asked to be seated. He told her there was a 15-20 minute wait. I'm sorry, what?!?! She told him that she had just called, and even showed him her cell phone call log. She even asked if he was the person she spoke with. He had no answers and just kept saying there was a 15-20 minute wait. We were pretty ticked off, to say the least. We would have been way more understanding if he had at least apologized for the miscommunication, or even during the phone call, told us about the wait and offered to put our name on the wait list ahead of our arrival. He did neither and tried to really undermine our intelligence. After the whole confrontation, another woman who was waiting came and asked us if we had been told there was no wait (I guess she overheard the conversation). We said yes, and she told us that they had done the same thing to her. She had a bigger problem than we did though, as she was calling to confirm no wait time because she had a child with special needs who would not handle the wait time well. To avoid a meltdown, she had called to assure her family could come in and sit to eat right away. She said they had been waiting for about 10 minutes, and her husband had taken their child out of the restaurant so as to avoid behaviors from the child during the long wait time. I'm sorry, but this is just wholly and completely unacceptable. Chili's, don't have your host lie to customers about the wait. There's no excuse for it.  I will not be back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=40

I KNOW I did wait I was already there and considering driving to another place and waiting a little there is about the same experience.  I  assume the man working the front seating and greeting the customers was the General Manager or maybe the shift manager that night.  I will say he was friendly and did greet everyone and asked your preference of dining table, which was appreciated and he gave us the expected wait time which was 45. He was also nice enough to let us know that the bar was first come first serve if a table came available we would just have to wait to for some one to clean it.  Once we were seated we were browsing the menu for quite some time before some one even came to tell us they were our waiter. We already knew what we wanted to eat for appetizer and dinner.   Took him a bit to come with our drinks. We received our appetizer first which... THANK THE GODS OF FOOD lol.. Because I was starving.. We ordered a trio sampler with egg rolls, wings and little burgers all of it was pretty .. I must say the wings were delicious tho they stood out the most to me.  For my main course I got a 60z steak medium rare with mashed and veggies. OF COURSE I LOVED THE MASHED POTATOES the steak was okay wasn't bad but I've had better.  Overall the FOOD portion of our night wasn't bad.  But the Waiter was just not attentive food came out served and he was really gone for most of the night..  and to this day I'm being made fun of for leaving an ""over generous"" tip for a crappy service.

Chili's has NEVER done anything but please me and everybody I come with! Their service is PHENOMENAL!!! I can literally go on and on at how amazing our server Alesha was on my last visit and we had a tiny glitch with the bill that the manager Terrell fixed instantly and kindly for us! I can literally go on and on about their service alone but I'm sure reviewing the food would also be helpful! Their Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers (or even the Honey Chipotle wings) are amazing! They are my go to for many years! They added a Roasted Street style corn option on the menu which is delicious! For app, we usually do the triple dipper with their southwest eggrolls, onion rings, and honey chipotle chicken wings. The eggrolls are not your typical eggrolls, they are filled with lots of good stuff like corn and spinach and have a pleasant, spicy kick to them. The tostada chips and guac are always on point with their warm chips too! I've had the mango lime grilled chicken a couple times as well, their fajitas and quesadillas, and almost all their soups and salads and they NEVER disappoint!!!! I could literally eat here everyday!  For dessert my go to has always been the molten chocolate cake.... it is literally to die for!!! They came out with a mini molten and also a caramel molten but all in all, the regular Molten Chocolate takes the cake! Their other chocolate chip cookie a la mode dessert is good too.

My biggest issue with this location is their crowd control. if you come after 6 pm on a Friday or Saturday, be prepared to wait. Unfortunately, it is so crowded that you cannot get a seat at the bar, and you may not be able to sit on the bench. Also, you do not want to walk away for a bit to do shopping in Village Crossing since they may call your name and put you at the end of the list.  The servers also seem overwhelmed at times.

Jeff g.,"Chicago, IL",1,48,,1.0,11/3/2017,"I've been coming to this Chilis location for 7 years. But this year I have been asking my wife why we keep coming to this location. They made the menu smaller which is a good idea since having such a huge menu not only confuses the customers but it also makes it difficult for the kitchen to make food quickly and well. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case for this location. This is supposed to be the flagship Chilis but they don't seem to be acting like it. I knew an employee for Chilis that had told us that they were going to start using a conveyor belt oven to cook all of the food, when I heard about that it seems like all the trouble started happening. The service is horrible, waitresses will show up to your table once in a while. Good luck getting a refill. Food is always late or never shows up. Food is frequently cold. And some of the changes to the menu are not good, the queso dip for example which used to be really good is now just a gross mess. The chicken crunchers are different as well, I don't know why they messed with the recipe. The manager however is always very understanding of the situation but I don't understand why they can't fix the problem. It's really sad to see a restaurant that I used to enjoy bringing my family to become so dysfunctional.  So in conclusion, the food quality is very inconsistent and the service is terrible. This has happened too many times and every time we give them another chance they screw up. I don't know about the other Chili's locations but this one really needs to clean up house and get staff that actually care about what they are doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie

Sorry I couldn't resist They are a little stingy with the sauce [Original, Habanero, Honey BBQ, Memphis Dry Rub, Brown Sugar Chile Rub or Honey-Chipotle] so if you like you ribs soaked you should let you waiter/waitress known. The drinks are good and if you like a Margarita then you MUST HAVE one, replace the Cuervo with a nice tequila, I recommend Patron. The service is great! Everyone is friendly and they really try hard to make you visit a good one! The prices are also very reasonable! A lot of parking so I just can't see a reason why you can not at least give this place a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=100
Kristina B.,"Chicago, IL",4,17,,2.0,6/26/2007,Boo this chili's  i happen to have a soft spot for chili's..but no more!!   It so happens that we were in the area (the chili's of choice is in the loop) and we decided to stop in for one of their uh-mazing salads and o course the bottomless chips and salsa. During the course of our meal....we were ignored by the waiter..we waited forever for our food.....and we never quite got our chips and salsa...   oh yeah and we had to leave out money on the table because we never actually managed to get the waiters attention for long enough to get a bill.... The absolute saddest part of all......it wasn't even busy when we went...there were approximately 12 tables open in OUR area....        Consumers beware when going to this chilis..the service sucks and the meal was strangely unfulfilling!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=100

At this location, the wait is a world of hurt.  I recently went to the downtown Chili's and guess what?  No wait on a Saturday at 8pm.  Some notables:  The queso is a bit on the beany side.  I'm always happy with their burgers.  Buffalo Chicken sandwich is a safe bet as well.   Also, if you are on a date, there is no need to impress by ordering the most expensive dish.  The Return on Taste (ROT) diminishes after you pass the $12 mark per entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=100

Jennifer M.,"Schaumburg, IL",140,349,292,3.0,4/11/2012,"When I'm out with Jason, we like sitting in the bar area. We prefer the booth for 2 along the perimeter by the window sill. This is because the table itself is small. The ledge displaces the clutter which gives us more square footage for food and drink. Jason's favorite dish is the Trio Fajitas so there's no chance we'll ever agree on saving a few dollars by ordering one of their 2 for $20 or 2 for $35 couple meal deals.  I ordered their New Chicken Club Quesadillas. I didn't need to order a side of guacamole for $.99 because it's already included in my dish. Someone should come by and clear our table while we're eating. They gave us refills but didn't bother taking our empty glasses and a fajita platter comes with multiple plates; things started to accumilate quickly, leaving us with little room to eat comfortably.

The experience was horrible from the food to the management. In my order I specifically asked for a diet coke and a burger with no onions not only did I get a regular coke      ( the person is diabetic) but I also got onions on my burger. I brought this up to my server, I asked him for a new burger since I know we make mistakes,  this time he got my burger right but forgot my fries. The poor guy seem lost in his own job so my next step was to talk to the manager. This guy is a really rude individual, he failed to introduce himself and was confused when I extended my hand to shake his hand. I started to complain about the situation and his facial expressions revealed his non caring attitude. Matt the manager on duty that night right away told me I had to pay for everything that was on my table. I didn't mind paying for the appetizers and drinks since we did eat and drank those but I refused to pay for something I didn't eat the burgers. He continued on and charged me anyway, I paid because maybe he thought that I was looking for any excuse to get a free meal. The point of the matter is that this manager and his crew is not properly trained.  Matt and your server I forgot to tip you so here: 1.Learn how to do your job. 2.

Time goes  by and the waiter brings the sides that come with the fajatas  then a couple minutes later the fajatas come.I ask the waiter weres are appetizer he looks at us like he  was stoned out of his mind and said wow j didnt no you ordered that.And on top of it he only brought us fajatas for one which let me tell you was all   this point I just wanted the hell out of there.You would think he would of apologized and ask if we wanted something else or if he could correct his mistakes but he   we ate the fajatas I mean the plate of onions and the waiter never even check back we had to hunt him down for the bill. This would of been a good time to start dine and dashing. I paid the bill  and  was not leaving a tip but when the waiter stands there with his hand out you feel obligated.

I'm not normally all about writing on the normal-ish restaurants or anything, but the thing about Chili's is that they're probably the high end in my opinion of the normal-ish restaurants. That is to say that I would prefer it to an applebee's or a TGI fridays.  I also learned that you can get a GOOD steak dinner (food was just perfect medium well) for the same price as you can a fajita plate (which too are absolutely filling and delicious.) The last fajita plate I got here was the Buffalo chicken one, it was good, but re-heated like all of their fajitas, not very good.

Jean C.,"Chicago, IL",59,279,48,3.0,7/15/2007,"Chili's is one of those restaurants where you say ""Well, we can always go to Chili's if there's nothing else.""   What Chili's is, is serviceable.  You can pretty much be certain to get a decent, party sort of drink (for which, read: sweetish, fruity and gimmicky), food that hits all the right notes for seasoning and texture (read: reliant upon salt and fat) and a fast enough turnover that even when there are half a million people waiting at the entrance, the wait for a table isn't usually overwhelming. This Chili's is no exception to those rules.  They're big with fun food, finger food and comfort food.  You could make a whole meal on their trendy appetizers, and while nothing will be exceptional, everything will at least satisfy the itch for a lot of flavor.  I see that a lot of people are saying that service here sucks, but I've been here a number of times and haven't noticed anything of the sort.  Take that FWIW. I feel as if I'm damning this place with faint praise, so I will say that I think their burgers are  really  good, and their portions are huge.  I also like the dessert shot concept which gives you half a dozen bites of little confections, and are just enough after your ginormous meal.

juicey S.,"Chicago, IL",2,6,6,2.0,12/26/2014,"We arrived around 9pm and you can imagine on a Thursday, it was not very crowded. But, that didn't reflect our dining experience as we repeatedly waited for the waitress to service our table. Food was blah. Service was even more blah. The only positive experience was the young lady who actually brought out our food (not the actual waitress). She was very pleasant and the only reason this review will get any stars..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60
Catherine S.,"South Bend, IN",0,4,,1.0,4/16/2016,"I give this visit only one star because the food was only ok and the service was absolutely terrible. Our server was nice but she didn't at all fulfill the basic requirements of her job.  She gave us our napkins/utensils after we had completely finished our first round of appetizers. Next she missed part of our order which came much later than it should have. When we were ready for our check we had to wait 20 minutes until we even SAW her again though she knew our table payment device was broken. The biggest problem by far was her absence. For every one time we saw her stop (maybe 4 times in total during our visit), we saw the waiter next door stop by 5 times. This is not an exaggeration. We had to occupy ourselves somehow while we were waiting for her to come back.  I understand that there is more than just one sever involved in serving each table. Unfortunately, this was a total team failure. Almost every part of our meal came out lukewarm, there was only a sprinkle of toppings on the salad leaving it very dry and gross, a couple of our food items were taken to another table, and our drinks and chips took exasperatingly long to be refilled. The hostess was friendly, but unfortunately everything after that point went downhill.  This was an incredibly frustrating and terrible experience. I don't see us coming back here any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60
Margaret A.,"Chicago, IL",16,150,1,5.0,2/28/2016,Started out on a bad foot.  They seated us next to a large loud party with screaming kids. They were terribly ignorant and annoying so i asked to be moved to another table.  They graciously gave us another table and were very nice.  Turned out the food and service was great after moving to a more pleasant area of the restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60
Julie C.,"Chicago, IL",3,30,,1.0,8/16/2014,"Yeah, I'm writing a review of a Chili's. I live in the city and don't get up to Skokie often. I was at the Village Crossing theater, and since someone had given me a gift card I wanted to use up, I placed a to-go order to pick up after the movie. They forgot part of my order, and when I returned to get it (I realized it was missing when I was about 10 minutes away from the restaurant), I didn't even get an apology. I got a smirk and a snarky attitude, and that really, really rubbed me the wrong way. I was annoyed enough to mutter something about not even getting an apology for the inconvenience. So I got another smirk and two employees chuckling at me as I left. I made the manager aware of the situation, since after I got back in my car I was pissed enough to call the restaurant. He was extremely apologetic but also sounded like he's heard this kind of stuff before. I'm not usually a ""let me talk to the manager"" kind of customer -- I've worked in customer service positions in the past and don't like being that person -- but the people at the pick-up counter were rude, and I have zero tolerance for that. The missing item wasn't even why I was upset; I was upset at the lack of an apology and being laughed at as I walked out. I will say that the manager was decent, as was the woman who answered the phone when I called to let the restaurant know I'd left without receiving an item. But I can't recommend that anyone use the to-go service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60

Enrique E.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,9/15/2014,"Just went to this restaurant. Chili's only gets two stars because their appetizers and water are good. Their entries were meh, and beyond. My wife's burger was ""nothing to write home about."" She ate half of it. On mine, Chicken/Beef/Shrimp trio. When server brought it to my table, the burned food smell was heavy. As I prod it throughout, I found the bell peppers were stacked to the dish, burnt char black, giving that awful bad smell. That the cook would send such dish to his customer is not only unprofessional, but highly disrespectful. Upon the food arriving to my table, I told the server ""oops,"" something got burned-dish clearly smelled it when she brought it. The green and red peppers were stuck to the hot plate-burned black and the burn stench was heavy. first cook's black eye, I had to send the dish back. When dish was brought back, presentation went out the door, dish looked all messy, second black eye for the cook. Some shrimps were not deveined, the steak was hard and beyond well done,tough as leather as a matter of fact. I asked the beef to be medium rare, and the chicken lacked flavor. Third black eye. Monday's cook is no cook at all! If I know anything about Chili's, is that they are known for spicing things up. I just had to bring my dish home to fix it, as it was sent to me, it was not worth eating. On a second thought, two stars are one too many. I do have to give credit to the manager for trying to make things right, I declined because of TV shows I have watched; such as cooks adding spit or buggers. The food was bad enough, I did not want my dish ""bugger"" flavored. This experience is what drives customers away, I am never going back. Three black eyes-and you are out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60
Angel T.,"Park Ridge, IL",551,11,2,3.0,2/16/2015,Great service usually but I don't suggest going here on a holiday .

Rose F.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,4/1/2015,"Bad experience, went on a slow Monday afternoon. Host didn't greet us till 12 mins later. He didn't really greet us because he didn't say anything, just looked at us. I said hi and asked if we can have a booth ,He pointed to the bar. He walked us to a table. I said booth please. He walked to a booth and pointed, still not saying a word and left. We sat there for another 10- 14 mins and the waiter came. At least he was friendly but sadly slow and would disappear.  This place is ether understaffed or they need to re trained their help. Just awful. The food finally came and that was the only good thing about this place. The waiter forgot our fries but he disappeared and we were done with our meal by the time he showed his face. He didn't give me my sugar for my Ice tea till 2o mins later. Seriously?? Wow",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60
Van O.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,15,14,3.0,9/29/2015,"I am giving only three stars only becuse our server Austin was amazing he was was traning someone new he was the right person for the job. If we needed or wanted something he was on top of it and we had it right away. Now the appetizers onion rings and fried cheese curds very good cant really mess that up. Two basic chesse bergers nothing special the food was not hot,  I ordered the shrimp tacos I gave them a chance the first time they hit me menu along time ago. .... I should have left it alone and ordered something else they were too spicy and and the flavor was not worth the money. Now the reason I am not going back to this location. If you have time to lean you have time to CLEAN!!! I hate seeing in to the kitchen area of a restraint and seeing the back look dirty this is where the food comes from it should be clean everything in a restaurant should be clean. There was what looked to be chips on the floor like they had been stepped on and it was not busy and three persons where standing a round doning not much two minutes to clean up the mess. Yes my kitchen of my home is clean all the time so should the place I pay to eat out at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60

Cassie S.,"Deerfield, IL",205,508,8,3.0,11/16/2010,"I know, it's a Chili's, right.  And a Chili's is a Chili's.  Except not always.  I've been to some pretty bad ones and this one is ok.  Not my favorite place to eat but there are worse things.  Plus, it's convenient.  It can definitely get crowded at dinner time, any night of the week.  But it's got a nice big bar space where there are usually open tables (at least on weeknights).  Decent number of healthy options on the menu, you just have to look for them (and not give into the temptation of all of the gooey, cheesy yummy sounding calorie traps).    And while it's definitely a family restaurant, my experiences haven't involved too many screaming children, which is a big plus in my book.  Lots of parking and if the wait is too long there are other options nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60

Caitlin B.,"Seattle, WA",69,207,214,1.0,3/24/2014,"I don't review a lot of chains, because I don't find there to be a huge variation between them. This one is not like all the others. Normally, Chili's is fine- a crowd pleaser with a lot of options on the menu, decent prices, big tables and good for groups, and inexpensive booze. We came here around 10 on a Saturday night while on the way home from the airport. We were a party of 5 and wanted to have dinner and drinks and relax. We were seated in the corner at a table for 6- great. Then our waiter showed up, and the night went downhill from there. He was totally absent minded, and it took FOREVER to get our food. When we wanted to order another round of drinks (hello?! Isn't that like money in your pocket, waiter friend?), he was nowhere to be found. We flagged down another waitress, but she actually refused to put in the order herself, even though we were happy to show ID again or find our actual waiter. So we didn't wind up ordering more drinks. Once the waiter did return, we got the checks, and they were not correct. He fixed them without complaint, but he completely ignored us after that, even though we stayed for at least 15 more minutes (the restaurant was pretty empty, and it was not closing soon).

Ralaina B.,"Chicago, IL",0,21,,3.0,8/20/2013,"The first time my family and I went to Chili's it was about 5 weeks ago at dinner time and everything was absolutely ah-mazing! The food was great and the service better! We even spoke to the manager about our great service. Unfortunately, the last time we went was about 3 weeks ago and it was completely opposite from our first experience. The server, John(?) just did not take very good care of us, took forever bringing us drink refills and a couple of times I had to send my daughter to a station to grab extra napkins and condiments. The rolled silverware was dirty with dried food stuck to it and they tried to cram a large family of four into a tiny corner table.

Jocelyn G.,"Chicago, IL",1,38,,4.0,5/20/2013,"I've been coming to this Chili's Restaurant for years.  It's my go-to for lunch, dinner, or drinks.  I come here at least once a week.  I used to come here for dinner, but lately we've been coming here for lunch.  The bar area is pretty great because of the no-wait time for a table.  The tables are pretty small, but the waitresses usually delay our orders so we have time to finish each meal so our table isn't bombarded with food. Sunday through Thursday is their happy hour special with $3.99 traditional margaritas.   I usually get the 2 for $20 dinners.  Lately, I've been ordering the chicken fajitas, which are awesome!   If you sign up for their e-mail list, you get coupons every week for either a free appetizer or free dessert, which is probably why we are there every week.   The waitress in the bar area is pretty good with our order, and since we are becoming regulars, she always has an idea of what we are going to order!

Scott D.,"Niles, IL",0,7,,1.0,1/3/2014,"I used to be a regular at this Chili's but sometime within the last year or so it went way, way down hill in both quality and service.  My most recent visit included a thick, long hair nestled within one of my quesadillas.   I almost swallowed the hair and immediately felt nauseous and instantly lost my appetite.  I'm not one to complain but I did mention this to the server who stated that they would give us a credit on the bill.  When the bill came, they credited an odd amount of $6.93.  The meal was one of those 2 for $20 deals which included an appetizer.  When I inquired how they figured the credit, they apparently did some accountant-like proration so we wouldn't get any credit for the appetizer.  After ruining my entire meal experience which in turn upset my friend as well, you would think they would comp us the measly $20 and just make us pay for the drinks, but no, they did some exacto prorated calculation.  At a bare minimum, any intelligent manager with even a bit of common sense would have just credited us $10 for half the food cost.  After I inquired about the $6.93 credit, the manager brought a revised bill with a $10 credit but at that point, not only was I still disgusted by almost eating the hair of unknown origin, but was also made by Chili's staff like I was trying to take advantage of the situation.    Needless to say,  I will NEVER, EVER return to this Chili's or probably any Chili's.  They permanently lost a customer.  And remember, when I dine out, it's usually me plus additional friends/family which translates to a lot of  lost revenue over time.  I will also spread the word about my experience to others.   All I can say is save yourself the aggravation of poor service and overpriced, low quality food and head over to place like Chipotle or Panera if you want a step up from typical fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-skokie?start=60
