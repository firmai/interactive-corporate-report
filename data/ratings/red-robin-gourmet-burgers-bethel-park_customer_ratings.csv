They are consistently great and I am very happy with all of the more healthier options and substitutions that are made available at these restaurants. The service is usually good and if you want a beer at this family place you can get one.

I grill better burgers than I can buy. If I'm jonesing for a sub-par burger, a Whopper from Burger King suffices and it's a quarter the price. The atmosphere is chaotic but the kids love it so I'll bump it a star.  If I had to compare it against Five Guys and Fuddruckers, I'd say Five Guys burgers taste the best, Fuddruckers gives you the best customization, and Red Robin is a blase third place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park?start=40,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

They also had the same choice with a grilled chicken sandwich  Bobby ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger which looked delicious.

47,Meghan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",184,475,736.0,2.0,2014-11-17,"Oh red robin. I just try so hard to like you but I just find you oh so boring.  Story- when my boyfriend and I started dating , red robin was his FAVORITE place to go. If I wanted to treat him, he wanted to come here. I tried tons of items on their menu and just never loved anything. Eventually, he broke away from his red robin obsession and moved onto chilli's (another place I just do not like, lol).  Him and I haven't been to a red robin in over a year- until yesterday. I was so hungry I didn't care where we went, so when he suggested red robin I figured why not? Although my memories of red robin consisted of bland chicken sandwiches and bland fries that are too large and just aren't very good in general- I figured I could find something I enjoyed.  Eh. First off, this location is always busy on the weekends. It's in the mall, so it's usually packed. Especially now that it's holiday season. We came around 3 on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy, which was nice.  I ordered a strawberry lemonade because I remembered they had good ones. Should have looked at the price first.. $5 for sugar water with frozen strawberries.. Why?! It was good don't get me wrong.. But $5? I'll skip it next time.  We ordered queso dip for an appetizer.. Honestly, this was the tastiest item we had. There was chunks of tomatoes and other vegetables and meat in the queso and I just devoured it. And for $5 it wasn't a bad deal.  I ordered the soup and salad combo figuring that there's no way they could mess it up. Eh. The French onion soup was ok- the onions weren't cooked enough though and the cheese that was melted on top was entirely too thick. The broth was decent though. The salad was miniature.. And their croutons just tasted, off. Their balsamic also tasted just odd.  My boyfriend likes their burgers, which is what they are ""famous"" for. I never tried one.  I hope his red robin fix will be satisfied for at least another year. Just another disappointing chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

21,Jan M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,140,24.0,1.0,2015-03-27,"Red Robin, ummmm, NO. You've fallen into the category of overpriced, poorly prepared food, and poorly run establishments. How is it on a early Thursday evening, (before 5p.m.) your food is cold, rubbery, and unappetizing?  My daughter ordered the Chophouse BG, and I got the Cod Fish & Chips, the fries were cold, and not thoroughly cooked. The fish were 4 fist sized chunks of cold, tough, and not crispy, or crunchy pieces of bland.  Fish & Chips for $12.99, cook it right, or take it off the menu, and stick to burgers.  Our server was slower than the cold patch crew for potholes. She was either having a hard time juggling her tables, or just the typical representative of this Red Robin.

19,Darren W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2949,1450,4662.0,4.0,2015-04-12,"I've still gotta lay into the chain-haters over Red Robin, 'cause I can't say that there's a single thing wrong with their burgers! And this was evident yesterday when Kay found herself with a coupon for a free burger for her birthday month.  The DGB (Damn Great Burger) is one of RR's newest inventions and features oven-roasted tomatoes, a roasted garlic aioli, an on-board mini-salad of fresh arugala dressed in a citrus-infused olive oil and a toasted, flour-dusted ciabatta bun. Tasty and exceedingly tidy thanks to the absorbent and sturdy ciabatta, the DGB's mildly charred and nicely seasoned patty was cooked to a fine mid-rare while the tomatoes brought a sweet smack to counter the tart arugala. I added pepperjack cheese to ramp up the twang a little, but the rich and piquant mayonnaise not only had a say in the matter, it nearly made the burger. I don't know how RR does it, but they do it well. Nothing about the burger tasted processed or flash frozen.  Look, it ain't BRGR. Red Robin operates at a different level and price point, but for a chain, I can't say RR puts out a crummy burger at all, and hell, they're even creative about them.  The ""Bottomless"" fries are another matter. While not an abomination in the eyes of Demeter, there is something a little bland about them, but their house seasoning is on every table to remedy that. Let's say I usually don't ask for seconds.  And wouldn't you know that my very first brush with the doughssaint/cronut craze happened in a suburban Red Robin franchise? RR calls 'em Towering Doh Rings and serve 'em in quantities of 4 or 8, all of 'em rung around a thin metal pole like horseshoes at a family reunion. What to say about them? They live up to their hype and description. What they really remind me of, though, are those sugary doughnut balls that American Chinese joints often sell. Or Indian batura bread? They had the fluffy/crispy texture I expected, and unexpectedly, two dipping sauces: Hot fudge and a sort of raspberry puree (remember that Prince song?) I surprisingly leaned towards the tangy berry juice, savoring each puffy, oily morsel as it was coated in saccharine grit.  Another odd and even newer dessert RR is offering these days is called Chocolate Fruffles. RR calls them ""soft fudge brownies,"" but they're more like cold, flat candy bars topped with sea salt and sugar crystals. These too come with a berry dipping sauce. Eh, I might have enjoyed them more if I'd been eating them inside the nearby Carmike Theater, but passable they were.  Hey, they take chances and thus take my dollars.  Oh, the service wasn't bad either. P.S. The guac 'n chips we had as a starter would give Mad Mex's version a good match anytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

The waitress replied that it was a popular salad but they just decided to change it. The other major menu change is your salad and soup pairing. You can now only pair a tossed salad with soup. Any other salad is considered a full meal portion salad. So I opted new bonsai salad and ordered a cup of french onion soup as a side. The soup came in a small square bowl. The salad was full sized but nothing to give a hoot about. FYI They have not removed the soup and sandwich pairing so I guess I'll have to go that route next time.

And now they have these new little kiosk monitors on the tables remove your server from the dining experience. After the meal, we got our check and the server took the check and giftcards we were paying with and returned the receipts for the giftcards. No check.

The whiskey river BBQ chx wrap, with lettuce tomato. The whiskey sauce was sweet with a little bit of a pepper taste. It was a big wrap and very yummy. The kids order of corn dog bite was plentiful, with 5 pieces of the dogs and a cup of fruit for our choice of side. The refill of fries was generous.      For desert, we chose two. The mountain high mudd pie was huge! It was a giant piece of ice cream cake with the top layer of chocolate ice cream and a cookie crum middle with the bottom layer of ice cream as cookies and cream. The crust was a chocolate cookie crust. It was topped with a generous amount of whipped cream with a chocolate and caramel drizzle! Yum! The second was the gooey chocolate brownie cake.

Upon arrival, 20 minutes sitting at table.  Asked twice if I could order.  Server arrives and takes my Chophouse burger order which basically is burger with mushrooms.  Added an order of onion rings also.  The burger only took 15 minutes, which was fine.  The burger itself not so great: the buns were soggy and everything had a mushy texture.  The onion rings helped a bit.   Trying to call a server to let him know or anyone for that matter was near impossible.  I finally gave up and walked over to the bar, the bartender had the worst look as though she hated her job with a passion.  Not only did she look that way, she displayed one of the worst disgusted looks I have ever seen as I attempted to ask her the question.  After another 12 minutes, I stopped a another waitress who refused to turn around and acknowledge me as I worked hard to explain to her about the birthday burger.  She said under her breath, ""yeah, I got it"" as she stormed on by.  Another 12 minutes flew by with absolutely no action.  My other half went up to the bar again to ask, this time the male manager and bartender both blew a gasket and berated her for asking again.   Finally, a full 30+ minutes later the server stops by claiming a six top occupied all his time.  Not only that, he was not informed to comp my birthday burger so spent yet another 10 minutes to fix.   Food and Customer Service?  Non-existent with management staff that further perpetuates that culture.  Zero stars - I want my time and money back.    ""Happy B day, Ken, from RR!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The floors are dirty, my seat and table had food on it, my table computer was broke, they forgot my special ketchup flavors, service was a little slow........... That's all",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
12,Abhishek M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",21,1,,4.0,2017-01-08,I so wanted to go to this place and it did not disappoint at all.We had a great time. I had crispy chicken burger and my wife had chicken teriyaki burger and to top it we had bottomless coke and garlic fries wwoooooo. The food was yummy.

51,Annie W.,"Bethel Park, PA",1,12,,1.0,2017-03-04,"We decided to try our local RR since it was close to home and we had a gift card. Glad we didn't have to foot the bill for a sub-par meal. The waitress was attentive and our Onion Ring Tower appetizer arrived as expected...hot and tasty! The burger ordered by my companion was definitely not as tasty as other RR locations in our area. I ordered the Fish and Shrimp Duo...big mistake...it arrived barely warm but the slaw was nice and hot! Obviously the victim of heat lamps used before a meal is picked up.Thankfully the ""Bottomless Fries"" were not offered...ours were limp and soggy! The restaurant appeared old, tired and needing a good cleaning! Sorry RR we won't be visiting this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
15,Shawn R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,49,1.0,3.0,2017-03-05,Since my last visit and review I gotta say they definitely had some positive changes. Our waitress seemed to be on top of her game and food came in perfect timing. Burgers cooked perfectly. Only complaint was greeters which there seemed to be three and were kind of confused when the place started getting packed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
50,Katherine Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",54,11,11.0,5.0,2017-03-14,We love this place for several reason but the number one reason we live it is because the are amazing with our family! Our family is gluten free and our oldest daughter has autism. They are always accommodating with there food selections and go out of their way to provide us information and food that is gluten free. BUT the even better part is that they treat my daughter with complete respect and just like a regular kid. This autism mom couldn't be happier,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
14,Jamie S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,10,,1.0,2017-06-03,The first couple of times I visited it was standard chain fare. Fine as an option of last resort but tasty nonetheless. The last time I visited I was horrified by the filth of this location. We were seated at a table with a dirty table and mess of soggy napkins and fries on the floor. It immediately made my stomach turn so we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
44,Kim B.,"Bethel Park, PA",0,45,3.0,2.0,2017-06-09,Had Lunch Wednesday this week. I had the new burger on the Tavern menu- it was a spicy burger menu said had hot pepper cheese and a new sauce spicy but I didn't find it to be spicy but it was tasty. I liked onion rings you can get as side for a little extra. My friend had a bbq chicken wrap she liked   it was a good meal for both. i went last Thursday for my freebie ham burger- i had large reds tavern Burger cooked too Perfection. It was really good oneI small Problem bottomless fries are not!I want another helping and waitress never brought them to Me? If their bottomless them when your finished the should ask you if you Like more ? My one thing also bottomless was an orange cream soda The menu said this delicious drink -they put ice on top whip cream which made it hard to stir in- what they should do mix it at bar with ice drain then whip cream so you can mix it in better  yourself! I didn't get a bottomless cream orange soda either? My lunch friend got her 2 raspberry cream one but I got 0-? Maybe we disabled are invisible to Red Robin staff? Its hard to eat out in wheelchair but the menu said bottomless drinks and fries and you should get them! other places like Sesame inn and  Bone fish treat disabled people nice and respectful- Red Robin Your staff needs to take courses on what the menus says& we should be asked would you care for another order of bottomless fries too!    6-3-2017 I want to thank all the staff at Red Robin at A Hills Village Mall.! I went There to have a take out of Big ted Tavern burger sweet potato Fries& side Onion rings to Go- time2o min to wait on sat wasn't bad either!

34,Lori B.,"Canonsburg, PA",8,179,453.0,4.0,2017-07-20,"We have always loved Red Robin and haven't been in awhile.  We went with friends and had a great waitress, Kristen.  Super friendly and helped us out when one of our burgers didn't arrive with everything it was supposed to have on it. She told us that they had a newer chef, but the problem was immediately rectified.  The only issue we really had was that she never asked us whether we were loyalty members, which we are, and we needed to pay our check with the little table kiosk in order to get the 20% military discount. We had to turn the machine on and thankfully since we had been before it wasn't an issue for us to log in and pay the check that way and get our discount.  My husband and I went with 2 of their newer burgers, the Mad Love (pricey at $14.49) and the Southern Charm($13.99).  His was the burger missing the onions which we did receive later, and mine was loaded with bacon, crispy cheese and avocado.  I loved mine and he was very happy with how his tasted as well.  Lots of goodness on those 2 babies.  Yum.  Overall we were once again happy with choosing RR.  Will be back again for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
48,Brian J.,"Sparks Glencoe, MD",0,2,,1.0,2017-09-03,This place really went downhill. I use to love their burgers here but now they're below average. The service is pretty awful too. We waited over an hour for a burger when they weren't even busy. Do yourself a favor and go down to BJs down the street for a much better burger and experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
39,Stephen B.,"Erie, PA",68,10,,2.0,2017-09-16,Aside from the nice waitress I was very disappointed. Always loved Red Robin but not this location. Food was edible but not that great dishes and flat ware weren't that clean. Would not recommend to family and friends. Most likely will not return to this location on future visits,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
38,Zack B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,2.0,2017-10-09,"The food was good, as with all other Red Robin's, but the service was highly lacking. My girlfriend and I came to sit down and get work done, banking on the utility of the bottomless fries along with the rest of our 30$ meal, but after not too long, in response to me asking for only our 3rd refill of supposedly bottomless fries, the waitress (Lisa) said, ""C'mon guys, you've been here for three hours and you're taking up my tables"". Never have I received service similar to that, especially when I was handed the check and was told ""take your time"". There were multiple open tables around us and there was no line, yet the service still tried to push us out the door, when we actually still planned on ordering milkshakes within minutes of the remark. Expect to come for quality food, but also to leave with a quality kick out the door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
41,Wes V.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,4,,1.0,2017-11-17,"Just had dinner here before going to a movie with my fiance. Was halfway through my 2nd and last beer. The bleach blonde waitress (only gave a description so others can avoid her) went to take a plate off the table and spilled half a 22 oz beer all over my clothes. Pants, shirt, and jacket all covered. Then then says ""I guess thats your que to go"" as if it was my fault.  Then asked if I would like a replacement beer. I said that would at least be nice. She comes back with a beer 1/4 filled and walks away without another word. Nothing offered to compensate the fact that I was covered in alcohol that she spilled on me, except for her giving me less beer than what she spilled in the first place.  I have been here at least twice a month for 6 years. I'll never go back. I wish she didnt ruin this restaurant for me. But that was the worse customer service I've ever experienced. If that's how they are trained. I don't recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
40,Annie B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-01,I came home for the holidays and my sister and I have been talking about going to Red Robin for weeks. I was so excited to come home and watch a movie with our takeout. We ordered two chicken sandwiches with fries and 2 sides of campfire sauce. We got home and opened up the boxes and saw that there was NO campfire sauce. I am extremely disappointed it's going to take me months to ever walk back in those doors. (Also my sisters bacon was not fully cooked).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
35,Lisa C.,"Colliers, WV",0,3,,2.0,2017-12-03,Well for starters I had an email stating with a $10 purchase I could receive a free milkshake. When I showed it to my server she said I did not spend $10. The email did not specify the purchase had to be on one meal. We spent over $30. It was slow going getting our food and the buns were extremely crumbly which made for a sloppy sandwich. My husband stated his macaroni wasn't that great and my sons burger was a bit dry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
32,Kelly M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",47,113,201.0,4.0,2017-12-09,"This location is a bit smaller than other Red Robins I have been to, but it is well taken care of and nicely decorated.  We were quoted a 10-15 minute wait and we were seated right at the 15 minute mark.    Our waitress was awesome and very on top of everything. The food was great. We got the honey Dijon boneless wings to start and they were so good! I got the bacon cheeseburger with a cup of French onion soup substituted in place of the French fries. The French onion soup was okay and a decent portion size but a bit on the salty side.   My boyfriend got the Burnin' Love burger with fries.  Unfortunately, about 1/4 through his burger, he realized it was a bean burger and not a beef burger. He let the waitress know and she apologized and gave him the correct meal free of charge to-go since he was already quite full at this point. They handled it swiftly and appropriately.  This is definitely a staple for us to go when we can't decide on a place to eat and it is always a solid choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
33,Erin V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,16,,2.0,2017-12-12,"I'm so hesitant to complain about bad service, because I know wait staff does not get paid much, BUT.  Red Robin isn't the cheapest restaurant around, and I was paying for this.  Went on Sunday, and yes the restaurant was crowded.  If it's understaffed, then that's a management problem.  But our waitress was obviously in a rush the whole time.  She'd set something down on the table and quickly turn and leave, before we could ask for anything else.  She didn't check on us, and was avoiding eye contact when we were trying to flag her down.  It really affected our meal - we had just taken the kids to see Santa at the mall, and I was looking forward to a nice lunch.  Will look for somewhere else next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bethel-park,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
