crystal y.,"Chicago, IL",1,63,4,2.0,7/27/2008,"So my friend had a gift card for TGI Friday's and we decided to go to this one. The service was amazingly... overly attentive. We got to the door, they welcomed us in, the waitress stopped by to ask for drinks, came back for our order, came back with the appetizers, came back to check on us, came back with entrees, checked on us again, and then maybe a little later checked on us 2 more times.  It's not a usual complaint that I have, and I do appreciate attentiveness. But occasionally, you just need to sit, eat and enjoy with no interruptions.  That said, I loved the green bean fries. They have a slight wasabi twist.  I do not believe that they are any better FOR you than regular fries, but they're very tasty. My Sirloin Bistro Salad.... not so much. Unfortunately, I had been spoiled by Lombardi's steak salad in Seattle. I expected crispier greens and steak that was more... steak-like.  All in all not bad, but not the best meal of my life by a long run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vancouver
