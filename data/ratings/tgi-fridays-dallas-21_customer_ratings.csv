I wish I had my waiter's name, because he was easily the best waiter I've ever had in any airport ever! I sat down for lunch and a beer while waiting for a flight. When he approached me he asked where I was traveling; I replied with ""Nashville."" He then told I had about an hour until that flight boarded, just enough to eat and maybe have a beer or two (I opted for just one beer.) After taking my order, he greeted the table next to me and asked where they were traveling to. When they said, ""Boston,"" he knew exactly how much time they had to sit and eat until their flight boarded. Amaze-balls. I'm always surprised when eateries in the airport seem to have no idea that people could be in a hurry to get somewhere. *cough* Baltimore McDonald's *cough* So I give major kuddos to this waiter who has seemed to memorize all the flight schedules and helps passengers get on their way after eating and/or drinking.

35,Jason B.,"North Bethesda, MD",132,64,255.0,5.0,2014-08-15,"My server quickly arrived at my table. It was an extremely busy Friday evening just outside the C29 terminal. My server offered me a selection of drink options. When we happened upon iced tea, my eyes flashed. I abruptly blurted out the question, ""Oh!! Sweet Tea?"" She could clearly see my expectant face. Without missing a beat, she cheerfully offered ""I can make sure it is.""  Please understand that on the day of my visit, I had been awake since 4 AM. To be offered such inventive and welcome problem solving is nigh on a godsend.  For my appetizer, I elected the mozzarella sticks. The hot marinara really worked well with the sticks and I quickly drained my first tub. Again, without missing a beat, my server offered me a refill (which I initially rejected as I though I didn't want / need it). It was not 2 minutes later, but she saw me scooping out the remnants of my first serving. This time, she asked if I was sure (about not wanting more marinara). Despite my embarrassment, I relented and happily accepted a refill.  At every point during my meal, I felt well cared for (without ever being made to feel rushed or harried). Everyone takes the time to complain. I wanted very much to take the time and sing the high praise for this location and my saving grace: my server.  My wife and I had a good laugh about it later on the phone (she is only TOO aware how much I crave good service).

At this point I started to notice people who ordered after me getting their food. normally I wouldn't mind much if I was not in a rush, but after 40 minutes of waiting for a cheeseburger I could clearly see something was not right here.  The Waitress seemed to not know what was taking so long for my food, which makes me think she either forgot to put my order in or the cook misplaced the order. After almost 45 minutes of waiting, the waitress brought out my food in a to-go box. The food was good and would be normally what I would expect from Friday's. However the service was under par.

20,Maggie X.,"Phoenix, AZ",121,384,4865.0,3.0,2014-10-19,"As far as chain-restaurants go, especially in airports, this location isn't too shabby.. but it is quintessentially still airport food. I had missed a connecting flight because the first flight was tardy and the second left early (argh AA!), so I had some time to kill before the next flight I was hoping to board left. Service was very efficient and friendly, with the manager even coming around to check on the food and service.  French toast (kid's size): ( ) The French toast here was surprisingly.. decent. It doesn't cross the border into some of the best I've had, but I've definitely had worse, and it came out piping hot with a good amount of egginess. Plus the kid's size was just right, both in pricing and in portion.  Veggie omelet with whole wheat toast: ( ) Maybe I shouldn't have opted for the veggie option, but I wasn't feeling too carnivorous after a red-eye, so I thought vegetables would settle more easily. My biggest gripe with the omelet was how much butter went into it and how in-your-face obvious the butter taste was. It was just too much to stomach, and I barely took a few bites before deeming it a lost cause. The vegetables inside were fine for the most part, except that I'd never had broccoli in a veggie omelet before and it was a little strange in texture. I probably would have just preferred some onions or tomatoes instead of the broccoli and bell peppers that dominated. The overall omelet definitely came off as more of a scramble.. or an interpretive art form version of an omelet.  To me, airport restaurants are in a sector of their own, and TGI Friday's earns a ""not bad"" in my book.

There are not a load of sit down food options in Terminal B since that Terminal is still under major construction in certain areas so this is a good option if you're looking to sit down for a bit. This location is clean and quick. The rating is 3* which I believe is just like Yelp says - A-OK and that's what Friday's is, A-OK. The service is fast and the food is hot.

5,Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",66,221,325.0,4.0,2016-11-08,"I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in years; not since like, the early 2000s or something like that. Imagine my surprise to discover that...yes...they do indeed serve breakfast. And a pretty decent one, I might add. At first, I considered ordering the traditional scrambled egg breakfast. Then I thought, ""Screw it! Give me the artery clogging delectation known as the Ham & Bacon omelet! YOLO!"" (okay, I didn't actually say ""Yolo"" out loud, but I was thinking it pretty hard) The omelet had a presentation I'm not used to seeing. It was flat. Literally. Like...the omelet was possibly the flattest omelet I ever laid eyes on. And even though the omelet was flatter than the plate it was resting on, it definitely didn't TASTE flat! The eggs were surprisingly well seasoned with a buttery aftertaste. The reason I say surprisingly is because normally these types of chain restaurants are scared of putting any seasoning in their menu items. But this...was a refreshing change of pace. Also got a side of homefries and they were...alright. Typical for a casual pub such as this. Oh, ya know these guys serve alcohol in the morning? Ch'yeah! Right off the bat, the waitress wanted to get my colleague and I drunk apparently. It wasn't even 9:00am yet. Now, I'm not opposed to the occasional mimosa with my breakfast. I just thought it was funny and unexpected. Only complaint I have for this location is the pricing of food. Breakfast really shouldn't be all that expensive unless we're eating, like, Chef Ramsay style food here. To put it another way, my side of homefries was $3 and they were average. Not great, but not terrible either. I just don't see why sides here are $3. I estimate my colleague paid about a dollar per slice of bacon he had.  The coffee was decent enough for what it was. All in all, I was surprised at the quality of food I got. Not a bad spot to visit if you happen to have a long enough layover to facilitate extended casual dining. Hey, it beats fast food, amirite? I'm giving TGI Fridays' breakfast: Airport Edition...4 happy hour beverages before noon out of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

I ordered the California Chicken Club sandwich, which was supposed to be grilled chicken, smoked Gouda, avocado, lettuce, bacon, aioli, and tomato on a baguette.  The sandwich smelled of bleach, and I narrowed it down to the bottom bun...it tasted weird and I ended up just removing it. I substituted truffle aioli for the normal one it was supposed to come with, and that was a mistake. The truffle aioli tasted strongly of chemicals...Anthony Bourdain would tell me it serves me right for ordering something with truffle oil in it (read Appetites...amazing!). The chicken was cold, and seemed old. It was crusted in some kind of red pepper flakes, and was rubbery and gross. The sandwich was topped with an unripe tomato and chopped romaine. The avocado was actually fine, and I scraped off the aioli and ate that with a fork. The bacon and Gouda were both cold.  I expected a freshly-grilled chicken breast with a melty slice of Gouda and warm crispy bacon, and I was super disappointed. If the menu indicated everything was cold, it wouldn't have been such a shock. Or the chef needs to actually cook things to order like a normal restaurant.  Super disappointing.

The service here was really efficient (I guess you would have to be at the airport) both our server and the food were quick. Unfortunately our server didn't have much of a personality, but that is ok when everything else is firing on all cylinders.  I had the Sirloin with Jack Daniel's glaze. The glaze was awful and all over everything! I asked our server for a side plate and managed to scrape the glaze off my steak and put it on the side plate. Our server walked by about 10 times and didn't ask or say anything. Then a Manager came walking by (must have noticed the multiple plates in front of me) and stopped to ask what was happening with my situation. I told her and she immediately apologized and replaced all the side items without the sauce.  I would totally go back next time we are at DFW, just wouldn't order the same thing.  P.S.
