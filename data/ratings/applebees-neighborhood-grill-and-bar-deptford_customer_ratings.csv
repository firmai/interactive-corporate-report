22,Lady C.,"Woodbury, NJ",0,1,1.0,1.0,2013-03-14,"This restaurant constantly overcooks their steaks. My husband and I both like to order it medium, and they always come out horribly overcooked. The six times I have frequented this restaurant in the last year, the steaks have been overcooked each time. The last two times I ordered the steaks carside to go, they were still overcooked. Why can't their chefs cook a decent steak?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford?start=20,,,,,
21,David O.,"Barrington, NJ",1,32,,1.0,2013-06-25,Is there a zero star??? I have ate here twice and have got sick for days from just a plain burger and fries! Unless your constipated I recommend you don't eat anything from here!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford?start=20,,,,,
17,David M.,"Deptford, NJ",74,191,44.0,3.0,2014-03-25,"Did a carside to go order recently and if all had gone as planned I would have given it 4 solid stars. The server was friendly and what I ordered was very good! Unfortunately we were given the wrong order.  I did not think to check the bag, I assumed everything was correct. I got a couple miles away when my cell phone rang, it was Applebee's telling me that they gave me the wrong food order. I turned around and went back to pick up the correct order. Soon as I pulled up the server came out with the correct order and told me to keep the wrong order. Can't beat free food right?  My wife and I both ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Tango that was advertised as new. It was on point. Very good. I am guessing the wrong order we received was a steak with side and salad and a chicken breast with side and salad. Chicken and steak were both dry. Sides were skimpy and the salads were limp and lifeless. I can only hope the guy who ordered that got something better. While it took longer than normal to get our food I was still pleased with what we ordered. Hard for me to complain about what we didn't order but in this case I will. Have ordered carside to go numerous times without a hitch. Hoping this was just a fluke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
16,Karen G.,"Philadelphia, PA",13,24,7.0,3.0,2014-07-27,"Okay, we were off to a bad start.  Party of 9 (4 adults & 5 kids ages 8-12).  It wasn't packed ( but we were packed in a kind of wrap around booth).   We were there an hour before our food was served.  The waitress kept up with drink refills and apologies.  5-stars for her! When the food finally arrived it was hot and impressive in both taste and presentation.  The burgers were mile-high with toppings, and the kids meals satisfied our big kids. I would say worth the wait but that wait was way too long with no visit from the management.    I'll come back for the Cowboy Burger and hope for the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
15,Steve G.,"Philadelphia, PA",35,13,3.0,3.0,2014-07-27,"Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty.  I gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
20,Eileen W.,"Monroeville, NJ",0,4,,2.0,2014-07-28,"Typical Applebee's ... Service is slow. Served salad, when it arrived- asked for silverware...again waited...

19,Donald N.,"Woodbury, NJ",7,7,4.0,4.0,2014-09-15,"Good food, fast service. Great people. Chicken wings are a must. Burgers are good. Steak is good.

4,Kathleen D.,"Richmond, VA",797,1719,11835.0,3.0,2015-01-14,"Every few months, I meet two of my friends from high school for mini ""reunions"" over, generally, good meals. This time around, it was one of the guy's turns to pick the restaurant and he chose this one. I'm often biased against establishments like Applebee's since they're so gimmicky, but this location only lacked in one regard: the food... for me. We were seated right away and given waters. Our server was really understanding when our friend was late and we waited some time to order. My one friend raved about his salad -- one with shrimp on it. He inhaled the whole thing while I hardly touched my dish in the meantime.  I had ordered the mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken fingers and it had the most peculiar taste to it. I couldn't figure it out until my other friend said he had it before and called it ""sweet."" Exactly the right word! I definitely was not expecting that and would never order that entree again. I knew the chicken would have have a honey taste, but didn't know it would seep into the pasta portion so much. It was just odd. Applebee's is not my top choice for dining out, nor would I ever go there unless corralled into a visit. This location is convenient in Deptford though -- right between Routes 42 and 55 and near a whole bunch of box stores and the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
18,E G.,"Millstone, NJ",0,6,,1.0,2015-01-16,"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would.  The service was AWFUL and the staff even worse.  We came in with a diverse group and honestly felt like we were in the deep south.  We were given the odd stares and the service was non-existent.  We have been to many Applebee's restaurants before and while no one should expect five star service as it is not a five star establishment, patrons should be treated with respect. We would NEVER dine at this Applebee's location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
14,L T.,"Stratford, NJ",0,7,,1.0,2015-08-29,"This is the second time in two weeks my family has walked out of this location. We thought we'd try again tonight, but the lack of family friendly and basic friendly service continues. We were shopping all day at the mall, we should have gone to the food court. We decided to try Applebee's again. We called ahead, we told them we needed seating for four adults plus two high chairs, ""no wait"", great cause we have two very hungry little ones 2 & 3 years old. We then drive across the mall parking lot within 4 mins. We arrive, and as stated we have 4 plus we asked for two high chairs. Guess what, ""sorry, it'll be a 25 min wait"". Do not go here if you have kids! You have been warned. And BTW as you can guess, the staff can't have cared less. We have been forced and evolved into a service based industry in this country, people better wake up or we'll lose that too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
10,Cassie J.,"Woodbury, NJ",138,388,295.0,3.0,2015-09-07,"To me-- Applebees are all the same. Decent food, decent service. I had went here for the event where they were offering free tastes of two of their new items. The smores dippers and Sriracha wings.  The sample sizes were kind of disappointing. I guess I had too high expectations. The smores dippers was OK. Nothing too special and I probably wouldn't order them again. The wings were just OK too. I tasted no Sriracha at all.   I do like their happy hour specials (and the one after 9 too!). Half price apps and $3 long islands is where it's at. I like most of their apps more than any of their meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
12,Ryan K.,"Mullica Hill, NJ",1041,150,50.0,5.0,2015-10-03,"Have been here quite a few times and have never had any problems at this location. Always polite and attentive servers.

6,Jay W.,"Westville, NJ",173,789,47.0,1.0,2015-10-05,"I don't really like Applebee's.  I ordered one of the menu identified lower calorie options (some kind of lemon chicken), because I've read about how overloaded the calories can be at Applebee's ln dishes that you wouldn't expect.  I shouldn't have been surprised that the salad that I ordered with my entree came covered in cheese.  Everything that I ate here that was cooked looked as if it was microwaved.   The little electronic thing on the table that you can use to play games, pay your bill, or call over the server charged me $1.99 to play games.  I was told that I was asked if I would accept the charges before playing the games, but I didn't see anything like that.  I was annoyed by this, I wouldn't buy a junky trivia app on my phone for $1.99, and if I would, I'd be able to use it for the rest of my phone's life.  The machine was there, so I messed around with it, I think it is nickel and dime bullshit that it is so easy to accidentally purchase something on those machines.   None of this experience was much of a surprise for me.  This account is about what I expect when I go to any Applebee's.  If I'm there, you can be sure it wasn't my choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
9,Rebecca M.,"Woodbury, NJ",127,12,4.0,2.0,2016-06-14,this applebees is the worst fucking one ive ever been too. I wasn't given the proper silverware for my dinner and my drinks took ten minutes to come out. my strawberry lemonade was halfway water down and I guess what was supposed to be the strawberry flavoring was stuck to the bottom no matter how long I stirred it. the waitress barely visited the table and i was served cold undercooked mozz sticks. safe to say I'm never coming back to this location again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,

2,Tricia G.,"Turnersville, NJ",164,510,1045.0,3.0,2016-09-01,"Oh Lord - this Applebee's!  This was our (2 adults and 3 children) 2nd trip to the Deptford location.   Our first visit ---- okay server and my steak (in my 'steak salad')  was  not rare as I had ordered.   After our food finally arrived, we waited a long time for our bill. ~~~~~~~~ 2nd visit - our server was seemingly new and forgot my side salad, forgot one of the kid's meals, messed up an order (no bacon on the vegetarian's wedge salad) and forgot a drink.   My steak was somewhat fatty and overcooked again.  I didn't even mention it. For all of the screw ups, we got ALL of the kid's meals taken off and my (late arriving & drowned) side Caesar salad. We joked that next time, we'll allot an extra hour onto our arrival time to allow for the mishaps & hopefully another $20 bill for 5 people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,

3,Donna W.,"Swedesboro, NJ",0,4,,2.0,2017-10-22,"It's a shame but I am always disappointed when I dine at any Applebee's location.  At my last visit I had the chicken and shrimp that was part of the 2 for $20.  The chicken and shrimp was so overly salted and seasoned as well as the potatoes that it was inedible.  Every time I eat there I find their food to be way over salted and seasoned or over cooked making it too charred and dry to eat. I heard they are closing 100+ stores,  my advice is they should focus more on fresh tasting and cooked food. I believe everything comes to them prepackaged and preseasoned and frozen from corporate and all they do is heat it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
1,Rick W.,"Absecon, NJ",2,98,2.0,2.0,2018-01-07,"Sunday night about 5pm coming home from Philly with Grandkids so decided to stop at this Applebees just off the AC Expressway.  Busy and a short wait for a table.  No problem. Usually no problem at any Applebees, however this one does have some real weaknesses.  Service after getting order was was unbearably slow.  Took at least 30 min to get food and with 3 - 9 year olds that's a long time.   Food at Applebee's is what you would expect, with one exception.  I ordered the Shrimp Wonton Stir Fry and there was no spicy dumpling sauce as promised on the menu, but stuff happens.  I signaled for waitress and she came right over.  Said she would get water for the table and the sauce that was missing. With that she proceed to take an order from the table of 6 behind us and then put that order into the computer near us.  So 8 - 10 min goes by and I'm sitting there with a plate of rice veggies and shrimp getting cold. All in all not a very pleasant experience for this Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
0,Jean C.,"Burlington, NJ",0,2,,5.0,2018-01-09,01/09/18 I just came back from Applebees I was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews because I hadn't been there for a while. Well I had nothing to worry about My Husband took me there for my Birthday. No one else there knew it was my Birthday. We had a server named Mo He was a great server. He had a least 5 tables that we saw maybe more that he was waiting on but treated all his customers the same asking always is everything ok do you need any thing else. The food came out fast and was excellent could not complain about anything. It was a great night Good Server great food . I will be back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-deptford,,,,,
