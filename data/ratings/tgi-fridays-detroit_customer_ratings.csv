52,Amy B.,"Boston, MA",573,707,619.0,3.0,2014-07-02,"Oh dear. Look, this place is a TGI Friday's in an airport. I feel like you have to judge it accordingly. I've found the service here to be pretty good. They recognize that you are likely in a rush and don't make you linger unless you want to. I also witnessed an incident here where a bartender was very kind and helpful to an exceedingly drunk and less than savvy traveler who couldn't figure out how to meet up with her friend. He also served her, at her request, Bud Light with olives in it. The food is, well, TGI Friday's food. I recently had the spicy salmon and the fish was cooked within an inch of its former life, but it didn't kill me and it was basically as described on the menu. Would I buy a plane ticket just to have this meal? No, but since I was there it was ok. They also carry at least 1-2 Michigan beers on tap here, which I appreciate. So, TGI Friday's.

7,Catherine O.,"Beverly Hills, MI",50,152,5.0,1.0,2014-07-03,"Even considering that this is airport food, the food here is BAD. My salad had at least a third of a cup of dressing on it and the chicken on top had a really moist (in a bad way) coating of pecans on it. I picked out as much un-drenched lettuce and as many mandarin oranges I could and ate the chicken, which I though was safe. It's 1.5 hours later now, and I have a terrible stomachache -- and I mean TERRIBLE. And I never get sick from food. Now I get to look forward to a super queasy and uncomfortable 2-hour flight. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was ""waaaaay too sweet"" but at least he's not nauseated.  The place is super cramped -- they don't have any extra room or designated space for bags or strollers (like other airport restaurants I've tried) so the place is a total fire hazard. The restaurant smells like bleach, which I guess is okay because that means they clean? Maybe? It's too bad because our waitress was very nice and our food came out quickly.

Limited menu but good food. Located directly across from the security gate in the Smith terminal. I must have caught just the right time. Loads of tables left and I beat the rush coming in too.

36,Dave E.,"Tacoma, WA",99,306,650.0,4.0,2017-04-01,"This has been my go-to ""waiting to board"" hangout for years at DTW.  I like to sit at the bar where there's an AC outlet for every person - I wish ALL airport restaurants did that!  We all have so many gizmos to charge, and nothing worse than draining your tablet device before boarding, and not having enough power to watch that movie you've been wanting to see. The service is always friendly, albeit slow at times due to under-staffing during ""rush hour"" but that's pretty common in airports.  Food quality is, well, ""chain store bar food"" - it's OK.  If you've never been to an airport TGI Friday's, it's a lot like Red Robin but with a much smaller menu.  Prices trend high - but when you do airports as often as I do, you just sign the slip and look the other way ....wink....  It is what it is. But if you're looking for a nice place to chill at DTW and just KNOW you're going to find AC power, and can order a beer at the same time, there's no other good option. 4 Yelp Stars Dave",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

I have been traveling all day and was STARVING!!! Servers just looked the other way while I waited to get sat at the hostess station. Took a lil longer than normal to get my initial drink to the point another waitress noticed my server was taking longer than expected.  I ordered a salad the chicken was over cooked, dry and crunchy I couldn't even cut into the chicken in some areas. The mixed greens were warm like they are kept out all day. Even though my salad specifically says it comes with kale. (No kale was involved). My server waited til was done eating to approach me and ask me how I was doing. Yes I still ate it because I was starving and was not about to try to order anything else.  Will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit?start=20,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

Ordered NY strip (medium rare) that tasted like it was re heated and seared on the grill also had a very burnt taste, shared with my family so we ate about less than half. We also ordered jack Daniels ribs the first slab was also dry and very tough. Second slab that was part of the order was brought out 5 minutes later was perfect. We asked if we could atleast get half off on the steak. The manager looked at us like we were stupid and gave us -3.00 off the steak.

They had open tables but no one to clear them. I ordered a side salad and boneless wings. They didn't have olive oil as a salad dressing option. The ""wings"" were processed meat nuggets shaped like wings. I'd rather go to McDonalds for those. I should have read the reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
39,Jeremy G.,"Chambersburg, PA",12,17,8.0,1.0,2017-12-03,"This was not a pleasant experience. There were open tables but the hostess decided to have a chat with a coworker rather than seat the potential customers standing in line at the entrance. The server struggled to locate items that several people ordered so she simply told the people that they did not have the item, even though it is on the menu. When she came by to tell me that my item was not available, she dropped the menu off and walked away. She did not return so that I could tell her my new order for about 5 or 6 minutes. This meant that my wife's meal came out well before my meal. This is an airport location but the staff don't seem to understand that concept. We were not in a hurry but there were other customers who were in a hurry and too many of them had to get up and hunt down their server to ask for the check. Our server asked if I needed a box for the last of my food. Um no, I don't really want to take leftovers on the plane.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
