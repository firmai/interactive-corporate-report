Carmik T.,Gilbert  AZ,66,373,692,10/8/2017,3.0,Not the service we generally receive from BJ's.Came in to dine about 6PM. A 25 min wait. Our server took our drink orders. I asked for a water with lemon  that request wasn't followed through.We started with the chicken wing appetizer. Very late arriving to our table.Meals ordered were the BJ's Brew Burger  The Pork Chop and the kids meal ( for bigger appetites) Chicken & Rice. Our meals arrived and they brought the wrong kids meal?! It was a Alfredo Pasta instead of what she originally ordered. Chefs had to remake our daughters meal & by the time it arrived  we were half way done with ours! They didn't comp it  nor did we get drinks replenished through out our dinner. Many delays from service to cooking staff. Hostess station seemed to have been running smoother'Food was good. Unfortunately  we were a little disappointed in the over all experience.
Juan G.,South El Monte  CA,0,1,,12/2/2017,1.0,Worst dinner date ever. They couldn't get my order right. Here are a list of things that went wrong.1. Ordered SierraMist got water 2. Had to wait 33 minutes to get the correct drink.3. Ordered a steak well done. I got a blue cooked steak. (Burned on the edges center is raw)4. Waited 40 something minutes to get my steak back  I cut off a piece it's medium rare now and the part that was showing the steak was just burned.5. Manager went to the wrong table to fix the mistake and got to us 20 minutes later.6. By that time the manager asked if we could wait to either get another steak cooked or a sandwich. But how much longer would that take.7. It took them another 30 minutes to get me the bill because the manager was chatting away with some of the employees.
Juan H.,Pico Rivera  CA,347,210,89,10/4/2017,4.0,The family and I came in on a Saturday afternoon. My daughter had just finished up a performance that was given by Simon Mall in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. We decided to go to Bj's since it has been awhile that we've been there.We were seated fairly quickly as it did not look busy. There were some tables that had large parties but it seemed manageable.Our server was Maria and although she was great at helping us with our son's order  her overall attentiveness was lacking. Again I don't know if she was tending to one of those other larger parties  but I must stress  when she did give us the attention  she was awesome.We ordered calamari and were impressed at the sauces and flavor of this dish.The kids ordered their own pizza and as I said earlier  Maria was very accommodating with my son (he's 2) in ordering a pan style pizza rather than a deep dish.We also had some wings with two sauces.The wife and I got a burger each and it was very filling.Overall we will come back and patronize.Anytime you can spend with family is time well spent.
Abel B.,Los Angeles  CA,383,84,1353,11/9/2017,4.0,I felt like not eating at home. I live in East Los Angeles and without a doubt there is great food all over. But I was feeling a bit more commercial last night so we decided on BJ's. Aside from having poor service in other BJ's this one has certainly provided good service every time we have visited. I had a pulled pork and bacon burger which was too much for me to finish. The offered unlimited fries for $10. It was a deal. I noticed that the fries are air fried which is good if your heart conscience.  Anyways this spot has always been good to me so it comes highly recommended. Food and beer always good here!
Brian P.,Montebello  CA,29,84,162,9/12/2017,4.0,My reviews solely based on the food because it seems like everyone that's leaving reviews are throwing shade on the workers. Place is usually pretty packed on the weekends but if your eating out in Montebello the choices are pretty limited.For large parties I suggest you make reservations or come early and put your name down and browse around the mall. The restaurant has a lot of drunk patrons as well so if that's not the environment that you anre seeking with your family than this isn't your place.Pizzas are really good especially the thin crust.Jambalaya is a bit pricey but that would be my all time favorite!Their beers are awesome and fresh because obviously they brew in house.Overall not too bad unless you have high expectations so just go in and grab a brewski and relax. Life is as hard as you want it to be.
Pete B.,Long Beach  CA,346,384,1832,7/31/2017,3.0,Went here for lunch  I hesitated long and hard before I ordered the half rack of short ribs.  I kept thinking are going to be awesome or just OK. The ribs here we're good and my side order of Brussels sprouts was a little too peppery for my tasteThe Caesar salad that I got as a side order was the favorite part of my lunch.  The Caesar dressing was the best I had in years.  I don't know if they make it here but its really good. I'm definitely coming back for a chicken Caesar salad on my next visit.
Moses W.,Kirkwood  MO,0,3,,12/5/2017,4.0,i love the music and great food.For sure recommending people.
Larry H.,Los Angeles  CA,118,349,32,9/13/2017,5.0,Well  for the first time ever  I was pleasantly surprised on our visit to this BJ's in Montebello.We came for lunch and we were seated swiftly. Our waitress Kristian was friggin 'AWESOME'!!!! I have NEVER had as good as service at any BJ's as we did with Kristian in Montebello. Kristian was extremely warm  polite  made sure everything was perfect and it was genuine  not an act. I told her that the entire BJ's staff should be trained by her for customer service and how to interact with customers. Simply the best!!!!We ordered our food and we tailored it to our liking and it came out as ordered to perfection. This has 'NEVER' occurred at a BJ's for me.The Prime Rib dip was perfect with the sauteed onions and green bell peppers. Made it close to a Philly sandwich. It was perfect at all levels. Taste  consistency  exactly enough onions  and peppers as asked for. The salads were also done as we requested  perfect.The chicken club was also made as ordered and was delicious. On this visit  it appeared to be that the QA was finally being watched at this establishment which was so refreshing.Good food  AWESOME service = great customer experience at BJ's! A recommendation to BJ's management  get Kristian in a lead role to train your staff. Kristian gets it!!! IT is hard to find  don't lose her! :)
Jeff L.,San Marino  CA,120,330,740,4/3/2017,4.0,This BJ's is in the Montebello mall. It's fairly big and there's tons of pokestops in reach for all you pokemon trainers that are still playing. This is a pretty standard BJ's  food is great. The pizzas are great  the pizookies are a must get dessert. Their sandwiches and other dishes are also really good so they're worth trying if you're not in the mood for pizza. I got the California chicken club this time and it wasn't bad at all. The sandwich is what it sounds like  chicken club sandwich with avocado. It came with a side of fries. I would also recommend their root beer too which is worth trying out.On occasion they'll have a 2 for $x however much it is now  and that's usually a pretty good deal  you get a soup/salad  medium pizza  and a pizookie. So be sure to take advantage of that deal whenever they have it.Download their app and you can make reservations through it. You can always call ahead as well  since they get pretty busy you won't have to wait as long. There always seems to be a wait here so being able to skip the line is always a plus. Apparently you can also pay for you bill directly at the table as well so that's another benefit that our waitress informed us about.
Maria C.,Walnut Park  Los Angeles  CA,21,33,21,11/26/2017,3.0,Slow service! We had to scarf down our meals and had to take the delicious Oreo Pizookie to go because we ran out of time. We waited 40 minutes for our food. I recommend the Downey location instead.
Teresa G.,Rosemead  CA,0,40,6,9/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Wow!!! So the general manager only acknowledges the good reviews. I notice I left a bad review 21 days ago. Wasn't even acknowledged. A good review was left 12 days ago & the general manager replied. To: general manager You should acknowledge all your reviews. Good or bad. Especially the 1 stars to find out what you can do to improve your restaurant. Or what you can do to bring the people who gave you 1 star back to your restaurant. I just checked my messages. Sorry... you did not send me a private message on 9/16. You must have forgotten to hit the send button. Have a good day
Gracie A.,Los Angeles  CA,12,69,20,11/14/2017,4.0,Happy hour Mondays and 1/2 off pizza. I crave the gf pizza w an ice cold Berry Burst Cider  yum. I always enjoy this BJs restaurant better than all others. Staff  James is super friendly and cheery. Always a pleasure to be served by him. And Gabriel   he was super helpful and went out of his way to accommodate my request. I suggest more gluten free options and if the happy hour specials also include the gf items  that would make it more amazing. Overall  love it
Victoria R.,Valencia  CA,0,14,2,11/13/2017,1.0,I called to place a pick up order and the guy transferred me and left me on hold for 6 minutes and I finally hung up and called back. Then i was on hold for another 5 min so I gave up and placed the order online. I got there after the food was supposed to be ready by and no one greeted me and the food still wasn't ready. When I got the food the chicken was disgusting and cold and there was a piece of cilantro in the ice cream.
Ken K.,Jacksonville  FL,24,283,23,8/30/2017,2.0,"OK - 1st off  I hate Yelp reviews that ding staff too much (The server did not make eye contact  yada yada  yada....) and don\'t focus on food  because as long as you\'re not blatantly rude  I don\'t care.BJ\'s was blatantly rude.I travel on business  and don\'t drink on the road (being in and out of germ tubes knocks down immunity  and I always get sick if I drink on the road) - I walked into a 3/4 empty BJ\'s and asked for a small table...The hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar  I said no (What\'s the use of being in a bar if you\'re not drinking? I just wanted a quiet meal) She then said  you\'re by yourself  are you sure you don\'t want to just sit at the bar? No  miss....I\'m 46 years old  and quite certain I know where I want to sit....So I get a table......and wait....after what seems to be @5 minutes with no one coming over  I set my timer and thought to myself  ""I\'ll give this place 5 minutes"" At 4:26 (now @10 minutes) someone finally came over - I ordered a diet coke and a flatbread.Diet coke came  someone other than my server brought flatbread (very good  BTW)......I sat with my rapidly empting diet coke with no interaction from server at all - for @15 minutes - server finally came  with check  asking if I wanted a refill  by this time  didn\'t bother... said no thanks - she drops check - full price for flatbread (1/2 off on Mondays....) - she snootily agrees with me  comes back with corrected check. Now I know 1 guy  no drinks taking a table not good for a server - I would usually tip 25% of full price - but in this case  gave 15 and left.As for the food  meh - decent - chili\'s food with a lot of different beers."
Andy N.,West Covina  CA,153,36,163,9/25/2017,1.0,This the worst service I ever been  appetite I ordered was wrong I asked for rib but come out boneless chicken wings. And take forever to get drinks  meatball spaghetti too much oil the meat I can even describe how bad it all fall in part no favors. I want have them to take back but the servers is too busy with other three tablets. I when to so many BJ's this one is the worst ever never going back again.
Vincent Artemio E.,Monterey Park  CA,62,111,492,9/19/2017,5.0,BJ's is an ideal place to meet with your friends especially after work. It's also an appropriate place to meet for a first date because the menu is geared towards small meals or large entrees or simply drinks. It's easy to slip in and sit near the bar or wait for a booth or larger table. The menu is a bit inflated in that there are too many choices. I usually order a seared salmon salad which is always fresh and delicious. The dishes here are not overly prepared or massively proportioned but there are so many choices that you have a difficult time choosing exactly what to order. The service here is excellent. The one time our order was late (very late) the manager came out and explained and apologized to us and provided us with a complimentary item. It was a very busy night and I appreciated that the manager took the time to see that we were satisfied and not feeling neglected. Recommended but prepare for a wait during peak times.
Ray R.,Alhambra  CA,574,80,608,4/5/2017,4.0,This is my go to place for a descent cold beer and great eats.One of my favorites are the brunettes and the Blondes.Im talking about beers.I love the nutty brunette so much I married one.The small appetizers are my favorite you gotta grab a few of those.The stuffed mushrooms are my favorite.Bjs is all good at Montebello.The staff at the bar is fantastic and there always looking to pour you another pint.We had a chance to go the other night on free poozookie night what a treat!4 stars.
Rosquete B.,Belmont  CA,17,949,366,9/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,4* BJ'sMontebelloVery nice Happy HourThe staff were very friendly and helpful (vast improvement over a previous visit)The salads are excellentThe lunch combos are a great valueNice beers by the glass
Rachel V.,Montebello  CA,0,1,1,11/14/2017,4.0,I crave a good salmon plate once in a while and I love their cherry chipotle glaze salmon  it's amazing! If you like beer  their house Hefeweizen taste great. Family friendly place if you have children. Friendly and helpful waitresses:)
Angelica S.,Anaheim  CA,174,21,1,11/9/2017,5.0,The food and service was exceptional despite us having such a large group. We had a party of 20 and were seated within maybe 10 minutes of arriving. The food cane out fast and was delicious. Thanks everybody!!
Robert V.,Monterey Park  CA,399,54,20,11/14/2017,2.0,Went there for lunch  was in the mood for a pasta. I got the jambalaya  my better half got the chicken and asparagus. We also ordered some avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. The egg rolls are not the same as I remember them. They have a new sauce in them  with like a spicy sour cream flavor. Not good at all. We get our dishes and for some reason hers is actually steaming and mine is barely even warm. The bite I took tasted as if it was coated with black pepper  no other flavor at all. It had a couple bits of sausage and 3 tiny shrimp  I asked the waitress why is it not steaming like her plate? She said I can put it in the microwave for you! I was like ok... While we waited I got a bite from my girls food  it was supposed to be penne pasta  we wondered why there was so much spaghetti noodles in there lol  we left most our food. We will not be going back soon.
yoonji l.,Los Angeles  CA,70,39,,8/9/2017,1.0,The hostess today was by far the rudest. I've never had an encounter with one as bad as her. It wasn't even busy and we were not rude so I don't know what her problem was. She should work in the back. Our food came out 45 minutes later. It was just a pizza and salad. People who sat after us got their meals before us of course. The waitress said it's because pizza takes time. Then the pizza should be HOT. NOT COLD.
Anthony H.,Los Angeles  CA,45,1,1,8/3/2017,1.0,To be honest one of the worst experience I have ever received at a resturant. Our server seemed uninterested in attending us let alone take out order. The food came out in an odd order. We got apps 25 mins later one entree and 30 mins later the last two entrees. I joined the member program and to be honest only thing that gave me service. We used a coupon code to get our free pozoki and we never received it. Had another code for $10 off and it wasn't applied. Had to walk to the host stand to get my check from the supervisor. When I toled him about our experience and our service all he did was apply the code I presented. No other action was taken. Food 1/10  service I can't rank because we didn't receive any. Overall experience we won't be back.
Angela R.,Los Angeles  CA,218,4,,7/19/2017,1.0,So I've never had complaints about this location until now. My brother and I got there and it was fine  we ordered our appetizer and we waited 30+ minutes for ALMOST cold chicken wings. We let it slide  it's a busy day. But it was not the end  our waiter also barely attended us to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything really.Anyways  we ordered our dessert  1 macadamia nut pizookie and 1 churro with ice cream which took another 30 minutes which was delivered by someone else and the ice cream was looking more like a pool that a solid scoop. BUT THAT WASNT ALL  when I tried to get a scoop of cookie I began having to stab it and even then it would not come apart. So i had to tell Nicklus our waiter the cookie was super hard and he brought another one. Luckily it wasn't another 30 minutes but rather a bit over 5.
Diane C.,Monterey Park  CA,69,1,,7/20/2017,2.0,"I started patronizing BJ\'s in1999 at their Westwood location when I would order lunch for our office staff 2-3 times a week.  At the time  although they\'d mess up the order 75% of the time and offer a free lunch the ""next time""  which was an awesome deal for the office  pretty much all of the salads were excellent  especially the Garden Medley Salad with Blackened Chicken.Sat at the bar last night and ordered their Santa Fe Entree Salad with Blackened Chicken. The lettuce in the salad consisted ONLY of the Ribs of Romaine  no leaves!!! Who the heck does that? While I realize they may use the leaves for burgers and sandwiches  I hardly think that the remaining ribs should be all I get for $13.75! I saw a photo on another review of a salad with only the romaine ribs too  who in management decided to tell their cooking staff to do this? Really poor decision...I think yesterday was the last time I\'ll ever consider ordering an overpriced salad with poor ingredients here again. In fact  maybe I\'ll just go with drinks at the bar  at happy hour or  maybe NOT!"
Perices M.,San Diego  CA,0,12,1,10/5/2017,5.0,My experience at this location was amazing. Jessica made everything perfect for me. I was dehydrated and very hungry. I sat instantly right at the bar. She catered to me right away not even there for 5 minutes. Take in mind the entire bar was full. I got a few items off the lunch menu. It was easy and good. She filled my water up every time without me asking. She definitely was on her A game. If you are out on business in Monterey park I definitely suggest you stop at the bar.
Jennifer C.,Los Angeles  CA,46,130,204,9/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Went to go eat on Sunday night. We saw one family was waiting. I asked the front how long is the wait and she said 20min. Really?! I see a lot of open tables and booth. I guess they were short on staff. We went ahead and got our selves seat at the bar. Bar had couple open booths plus tables.Even though they cleaned the table  there were still crumbs on the table and chairs. We looked at menu for good 5 mins and was waiting for a server to stop by. Couple of sever pass by but none of them stop for us.15 mins later  server came by to take our order. We figured if we order just drinks  she won't be back for another good 20-30mins so we ordered everything at once. 10 mins later  a male server came by to drop off our appetizer. Appetizer came before the drinks... The drinks didn't even come til 10mins after. I didn't like their hibiscus tea. Didn't taste as I thought it would be.Our food arrived about 20mins after munching our appetizer. The presentation and the quality of the food was decent.Since my food was a little greasy  I needed refill on my drink. I put the empty cup by the corner so that our server can see but non of the server weren't generous enough to ask me if I wanted a refill. Couple mins later our server came back and I told her I would like refill. Depending on which location you go but this one is not that great.
Gabby S.,Los Angeles  CA,52,12,12,10/17/2017,4.0,Glendale great place to have a late night pizza craving. The service was a little slow but overall enjoyed my late night dinner and the fact that it wasn't so crowded.
xiomara c.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,1,6/15/2017,3.0,We had the best server James G. This location is so lucky to have him working here  he is attentive and so pleasant  however the kitchen needs a little work we ordered some salads and they gave us so much of the romain ribs that I had to show the manager. The manager was apologetic and pleasant overall
Ivette G.,Los Angeles  CA,4,35,9,8/4/2017,1.0,Having a fever in this 90 degree weather is no fun. I decided to order some delivery from BJS today. Order was placed at 12:53 pm; Which included a clam chowder  some grilled chicken alfredo & a Pepsi. My order was set to arrive at 1:45...it's now 2:15..no call from any BJ's employee or even the delivery driver themselves explaining why they're taking 30 minutes + to deliver. Update: my order isn't coming. Called the restaurant to cancel my order and get a full refund  the manager was really nice. Tip: don't order delivery from this BJ's.
Donna C.,Los Angeles  CA,228,417,505,5/31/2017,5.0,BJ's Favorite pizza is always a safe choice here and always good! I also love when BJ's has promotions like a free appetizer with over $10 purchase because it allows me try something new. Make sure to check online for coupons before going so you make the most out of your meal. And definitely join their rewards program so you can earn free menu items or credit.
Chrystina B.,West Covina  CA,34,52,93,11/26/2016,5.0,For my FIRST time ever being at a bjs  I'm so glad it was at this one in Montebello! Service : 10/10The food : 10/10 Atmosphere 10/10I was really shocked! Since I was a first timer  I decided to order a little bit of everything. We ordered : - Appetizer -A mini deep dish pizza (11$) : my only regret was not getting a bigger one lol -Dinner-12 oz Ribeye w/mashed potatoes  veggies and shrimp. It can with a claim chowder (30$) : The meant wasn't chewy and it was literally cooked and seasoned PERFECT. Also comes with a free pizookie -Jambalaya (18$) : spicy and not shy with the chicken and shrimp -Dessert- warm white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Worth every calorie !My bill was 70$ and worth EVERY cent! I will definitely be back and to this specific location.
Jen H.,Pico Rivera  CA,1,14,38,8/6/2017,3.0,I use to love the Mac and cheese here but they DC... Boooo. Totally sucks. Clam chowder is pretty good though. Pizza is good. Nothing special. Sweet potato fries are great here.
Sergio G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,73,,11/17/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Beware this BJ's has the RUDEST and clueless bartenders. I've been to quite a few BJ's locations and the Montebello facility employs by far the most unfriendly team of bartenders.I can't quite figure out why the bartenders have such a shitty attitude. Not sure if they have a crisis in their personal lives or if they're just plain idiots that need to be re-trained pronto in the area of customer service. Whatever the case may be these individuals are too complacent in their role at work.Obviously their IQ level is rather low that they can't quite comprehend that patrons are the ones who pay their salaries and patrons are the reason why their sorry ass isn't at the unemployment line. I strongly recommend to BJ's management to dissolve the current bartending team and hire a crew that is professional  attentive and appreciates the business from paying patrons! The more some things change  the more they stay the same...
Luis A.,Santa Ana  CA,68,9,23,9/21/2017,1.0,"Been coming to BJ\'s for a long time now. Must say  today I have experienced the worst customer service. Guess I\'ll need to switch to a different location. Called in my order and the person taking my order kept charging me the wrong price several times. I asked for a few extra garlic knotts and they were trying to charge me extra. They had always given me a few complimentary. They said the rule was ""if it\'s 4 or more  we charge."" I then said  I only asked for 3 extra  but they continued to insist in wanting to sell them to me. I don\'t mind paying  but be consistent with what you say. They offered to bring a manager to speak to me  and took forever to come out. I guess the service is reflected equally from the top to the bottom."
Oscar M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,,10/9/2017,5.0,Came into this place a couple days ago craving some pasta. I have never been to BJ's before so I was amused by the nice big menu they have. They also do sell a bunch of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. The small garlic bread that comes with your pasta is so delicious  I wish they came in two on your plate. Pasta was also very tasty and with a hint more of parmesan cheese making it even tastier! Great place to come and watch a game also. Lots of TVs and a huge projected one on the bar side area. Hope to come back soon and try some steak!
Chris C.,Whittier  CA,2,18,,6/19/2017,2.0,Came here yesterday for Father's day  which I knew I shouldn't have  but the misses insisted. Wait was about 40 minutes  it was expected. Server was nice and friendly  I chose the jambalaya which he recommended  it was smothered in white onions and too much sauce drenched the rice pilaf. There was powdered pepper all over side of the plate  as if whoever prepared my plate was in a hurry. Was far too spicy for my liking  I couldn't really taste or enjoy. Very little meats. Left more than half the plate  all vegetables and sauce.  I usually don't like coming here because the food isn't the best. Should have gone for a pizza of theirs instead. They did give out a Father's day glass and a 20% VIP card to use NEXT visit. Lol they could've just let you use the 20% for Father's day there and then. Oh well.
Lidia B.,Baldwin Park  CA,20,31,,9/1/2017,5.0,Stopped by for a couple of mimosas after some shopping and met Gabby who was attending the bar at the time. She was so nice and cheerful. Insisted on cleaning the area I sat down at even though I didn't mind. We started chatting in between her helping the other patrons and found out that she was another I Love Lucy fan as me. She was as sweet as can be. Will definitely come back to pay her a visit.
Laura S.,Bell  CA,5,48,57,4/27/2017,2.0,I have had unpleasant experiences at this Bjs  the times I've been here with friends. Both times I see that the waiters take on more parties than they should. First time we were there he forgot to bring us our coffee and pzookie we had to ask again. Second time there Michael was told there was a birthday I think he forgot about us because he just returned to give us our credit cards and that was the last time he was seen at our table. In shorter words please don't take on too many parties  then you provide bad service to others and in my opinion this isn't fair.
Katie N.,Los Angeles  CA,47,84,71,9/24/2017,4.0,I had an awesome time in BJ's last night. The rib eye steak was cooked well. The steak was nicely done and moist unlike other steak places. I have been to many Good steak places so far and this is one of my favorite. Customer Service wasn't bad. It's Saturday so it's gonna be crowded. I was okay with the customer service. Don't forget to order Honey Glazed Chipotle Salmon. It's really good. The only thing i didn't like was honey saracha brussel sprouts.
Ejler B.,Brea  CA,7,19,2,8/27/2017,1.0,Absolute worst service. Been here for three hours. Ordered a pozo olor about an hour ago. Manger is involved  took a good 10 minutes for him to even come over. Staff is super rude  had to ask several times for silverware and sugar for my coffee. Took them forever to bring it out. Still waiting for the pizookie..... when we asked for the manager the staff member was super rude about it.
Enrique C.,South El Monte  CA,1,1,,5/16/2017,3.0,Nice place  ok food. I wonder why it takes forever to get drinks from the bar  is it a tactic or something they're not telling us? I could easily have 3 drinks wherever place I go for dinner expect here. Takes forever! Forever! Lol
Mandee F.,Raynham  MA,142,51,2,5/5/2017,4.0,4 stars for a great menu and lots of options!Our first visit here  we had Daniel as our server and he was excellent! Despite how busy he was with tables  he was quick to act on every request and checked in on us frequently. He even put us at a larger booth without us even asking which was amazing. Highly recommend!The 2nd time (2 days later) I believe we had Cheyenne according to our receipt. She didn't introduce herself  nor was she anywhere near as receptive or alert to our table. We had 2 different items that came out either with something we asked to remove (no lemon in waters  both came with lemon) or with items we asked for extras of (additional garlic knots). When she brought items to us  she dropped and walked away so quickly we couldn't even get a word in. It ended up prolonging the visit longer than we wanted because she was always moving too fast for us to ask anything. Definitely ask for Daniel if you go. Great server!! Would've been a 5 star experience had it not been for our disappointing experience this evening.
Leslie E.,Long Beach  CA,714,295,455,3/14/2017,4.0,I had the deep dish pizza. It was great.  The waiter was very nice and kept giving us attention even know he was busy. The main problem was. It was very loud. There was a lot of background noise. They need to put some type of noise dampener if the place. My wife had the calamari. She asked for a box to take the leftovers home. The waitress was fast. But  not as fast as my wife. To say the least no we did not need a leftover box. There is a big discrepancy of BJ restaurants. The quality out of the kitchen is not consistent. The location is consistently excellent. I recommend this location.
Shelby R.,Pasadena  CA,79,7,15,7/16/2017,1.0,"If I could leave no stars  I would. Not only are their servers incompetent  their customer service is subpar at best. It took us one hour to receive our food once ordered  and when we did receive it  my father pulled a 6"" hair out of his BJ\'s Brewhouse Burger. When we asked to speak with the manager  he proceeded to try and make a joke  and laughing matter out of the situation despite our disgust. They made no attempts to redeem themselves  and the manager wasn\'t helpful or attentive in the least bit. We\'ve lived in Montebello for over thirty years  and will be sure to never return to this location  and will ensure that our friends and family are aware of what has happened  and how we were treated."
gArrett T.,Glendora  CA,26,39,42,7/16/2017,1.0,My father in law just choked on a long hair that was inside his burger. We were so grossed out we got up left. Do not eat here.
Kit C.,Pasadena  CA,12,11,,8/7/2017,2.0,I should have left when they told me I have to wait 40-50 mins. I have been many other BJ location. This is the worst I can ever experienced. We have a large party and the server is not attentive at all. I understand it was busy. But she never come and check on us after we ordered our food and like other people mention here the food come in odd order we got one entree and the rest of the 8 people's just have to stare at one dish? When I told our server they forgot to put avacado on my taco which I know it's a add on. She gave me attitude and I was shocked. I love their deep dish pizza but I guess from now on I just have to go to different location :(
Hector R.,Whittier  CA,0,5,,8/4/2017,1.0,It was a great experience until she couldn't break a check 3 ways...thanks for having us do the math for 20 minutes
S K.,Alhambra  CA,0,24,37,12/4/2016,1.0,Not a good experience. I had my first experience here on a Sunday night. A party of 2. We arrived at 7:11  got seated around 8. We were still waiting for our dessert to come when we were asked to pay at 9:30 (which we did).Everything was so slow. Our sides came first  even before our utensils. Then our food  which was over cooked and super salty. When they replaced our steak  they failed to bring me back the side that it came with and the knife to cut the steak. So much butter on everything. The pizza was good. We asked for a refill on our drinks on several occasions  but never got refilled. Not happy and will not be coming back.
Daddy E.,Newberry Springs  CA,0,4,,6/1/2017,3.0,I enjoy coming to this BJ's in Montebello. It's relatively close to home. The service is great and the food is delicious. There is just a huge issue that I have. I typically visit for big sporting events  to hang out with friends  watch the game and enjoy a nice cold BJ's brewed Oasis Amber. The problem is that their tv's are so out dated  viewing the game is difficult when their main screen keeps flickering at the top. Their picture quality isn't up to par and their tv's all around are just as bad. (Sad face)If it weren't for the tv's  I'd definitely rate this place a 5 star.
Denise G.,Long Beach  CA,0,32,74,3/31/2017,5.0,I recently visited for lunch and I must say it was delicious! The lunch options are great sizes and then if you have the mobile app everything is just made 100% simpler as you can use your coupons/specials and pay your bill all at your own convenient time. We got the bison burger  the mini pizookie  soup and salad combo  and the fried chicken. All these were the lunch portions but beyond perfect sizes. We were seated promptly and given great service. We will definitely be back for lunch. Be sure to keep an eye on your rewards  the happy hour specials  any online coupons  and any weekday specials as you can combine all of them at the same time to walk out with a bargain!
Evelyn E.,Alhambra  CA,0,2,1,1/22/2017,1.0,Manager  greeter  waiter and runner were great! However  we found a penis shape sketched into our kids food! Not cool!
Antonia R.,Oceanside  CA,33,7,,9/10/2017,1.0,"I had to ask the wAitress 2 times to bring me ranch dressing and she forgot. Then i asked her for a refill on my drink  took a while to get it. After i was done with my food she says ""u still need that ranch""! Ughh really. And to top it off the food was warm  not hot."
James K.,Davis  CA,39,64,,9/4/2017,1.0,All the reviews you read here about the service at this restaurant are true. The service is atrocious. I came here on a Saturday to celebrate my mom's birthday. It took ten minutes for our server to take our order for drinks. It took ten minutes for the drinks to show up. We had to place our food order with the hostess (who was extremely nice and far and away the most helpful person) since we were seated in a table near the front. Literally the hostess would be the only person we would see for large periods of time. Drink refills were few and far between and took ten minutes to get. The food was ok. My garlic green beans did not have any garlic and were burnt. The ribs were good. My mom's ziti had several tablespoons of fat in the bottom. It's probably from the pepperoni that is in it. They don't render some of the fat out or use a leaner pepperoni so the dish was swimming in fat. Wife had the Cobb salad  which she said was decent. After we were finished eating we asked for my mom's birthday pizookie. We waited and waited and it never showed up. Asked for the bill. Saw the free pizookie was charged to us. Had to have that taken off. The hostess helped to take the pizookie off and she brought us out a pizookie to go with an apology. Our server was slow and incompetent. With all the negative reviews pertaining to service you would have to guess it's a systemic problem. This stuff reflects poorly on management who I would think is the real problem. Either they don't know how to train staff or they don't know how to schedule their employees (or both). It shouldn't take well over an hour and a half to eat dinner (unless you want it to of course). Pro tip: Don't eat here if you would like service.
Genevieve G.,Los Angeles  CA,6,65,38,2/19/2017,3.0,It's a great place to eat if you go when they open. If you go after 5 pm it's busy and you will get wonderful service from Valerie- or Maria - but if u sit towards the back where restrooms are the service tends to not be so great . Try to be seated next to entrance I notice those tables get served faster and better. If the woman manager is on duty service is probably going to be good . The food is delicious order over phone if u don't want to wait to be seated and served . Lunch portions are big and inexpensive. Drinks are good . It's just ok service if it's after 6 pm - depends who takes care of u . Val is the best server !!! Ask for her or Maria if u go in morning ! So mornings on the weekends are great
Gregory M.,Rosemead  CA,88,22,,8/14/2017,1.0,Ordered giant meatballs and spaghetti to go and when my daughter took a bite  she spit it out...WAY TOO MUCH WHITE PEPPER!!! Why do restaurants over season foods? This has become more common these days...why? No one here could it...had to dump it...wasted my money on that one...
Grace C.,Monrovia  CA,265,830,716,6/23/2016,3.0,One of our default spots for lunch outings if 1) we can't think of where to go; 2) we don't want to go far; 3) we have a sizable group; and/or 4) we want to appeal to everyone's taste (some people consider Asian cuisine too exotic). One of the downsides is that you'll get slow service no matter what time you go.I typically order the seared ahi salad if I'm feeling in the mood for a light meal (ahi with baby field greens  napa cabbage  romaine  red bell peppers  tomatoes  avocado  pickled cucumber  cilantro  wasabi  wonton strips and green onions  tossed with rice wine vinaigrette). If not  I like their lunch flatbread and soup combo (margherita fresca and clam chowder).Plenty of mall parking. A/C tends to run cold here  so bring a sweater if you're sensitive to the cold.
Ji C.,Tustin  CA,166,152,385,12/26/2016,3.0,Pretty standard corporate-owned dining experience. The food is decent  ambiance is above average and service is standard. It's a good place for standard issue events like holiday dinners  get-togethers and other times when you need a safe-choice without too much risk (IE when you don't seek the adventure of an ethnic menu at a mom & pop place you've never been to). A little pricey for what you get but it's like a bond - safe.
Jennifer W.,San Gabriel  CA,587,151,729,12/17/2015,3.0,Came here for a work holiday lunch. Service was soso. Food definitely takes forever though. It was decent to the taste. Id come back to drink here. They have a huge selection and its nice their drinks menu has a break down of beer pairings. This review is more of a 3.5. Id give it another chance. For food  I got the salmon quinoa bowl  cherry chipotle sauce instead of the miso glaze. Surprisingly filling! It was on the sweet end  but went really well with red pepper flakes.
Ralph T.,Montebello  CA,2,9,,7/7/2017,2.0,Came for dinner with 3other friends  ordered ribs. The ribs were okay  joined the club did not receive the free desert. Will not be returning.
Don C.,Alhambra  CA,16,50,53,3/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Considerable improvement since my first review so I have become a regular again. I just wish they would bring back some of my discontinued favorites such as the sesame chicken salad  grilled pork chops  and mahi mahi - or any other fish than salmon!Reasonable prices  friendly and attentive service  fresh items (crisp salads)  and a willingness to cheerfully make a substitution (I can have rice pilaf or baked potato in place of fries for example) make this a great place to dine!
Nicholas A.,San Jose  CA,331,49,124,8/20/2016,2.0,"When attending a chain restaurant - there are two things I look for: consistent food quality and service. Food Quality - consistent with other Bj\'s that I have visited through Northern and Southern California. No complaints on the deep dish or thin crust pizza that was ordered. Quality of Service - if you made it to this point you are probably wondering ""why the 2/5 stars?"" Well the service was below any prior experiences that I have had at a Bj\'s. Long waits during each stage of the meal required proactive flagging down of our waiter or other staff walking by the even get the enough plates or sets of silverware on the table. Drink refills. Getting the bill. Paying for the bill. Slow. Slow. Slow. Fortunately the food came out at a good pace. Thank goodness for that! Gonna pass next time I considering going to this Bj\'s location. I\'ll stick to others."
Violeta M.,El Monte  CA,58,1,,8/18/2017,1.0,Really bad service. They brought our food late and to top it off my husband was having pizza and the server came and just took the Parmesan cheese when he was not done eating. It's not the first time they give us bad service . Tonight is definitely the last time we will be eating at a Bjs Restaurant.
Carlos U.,Monterey Park  CA,64,5,,4/22/2017,4.0,This is the one place that the whole family can always agree on when we can't agree on anything else. The kids love the pizza but I recommend the Ribeye steak. It was super juicy and tasted fantastic. All the appetizers are great. My fave are the avocado egg rolls. And the blackened salmon is another go-to meal for me. The place does get busy in the evenings and weekends so you can expect a wait. They have an app that you can use to get on the wait list. You can also pay your bill and you get really good discounts and offers. Big bar  lots of TV's everywhere.
Vinh H.,Fountain Valley  CA,13,23,30,1/15/2017,5.0,I've been to many BJ's restaurants but this was my first time here. I saw the 3 star review and it didn't phase me because that's how big name restaurants always go. Anyway  I ordered calamari  honey sriracha brussel sprouts  stuffed mushrooms to start. My entree was jambalaya with a side salad of tomato and mozzarella. My fiance ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I would take pics but the restaurants lighting is too dim and I'm not fond of using a flash. Now I usually order the same stuff at every BJ's and sometimes I send stuff back when it tastes terrible. Today though  every single thing we ordered was delicious! Oreo Pizookie was on point as always.Service wise  everything was great! our servers name was Stephanie. She was super nice and accommodating even to my picky nature. (I can sometimes be difficult in restaurants because I expect to get what I paid for)I recommend giving this place a shot. Ask for Stephanie for great service.
Mei M.,Monterey Park  CA,747,120,3615,4/28/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I was very disappointed with the service tonight. One of the reasons we decided to go to dinner there tonight and not Fri-Sun was because we thought it would be less crowded and therefore better service. While the first part was correct  the second part was not. We were promptly seated and abandoned by our server (or so it felt at least). Our server would disappear for long periods of time. I understand (in talking to him) that 3 servers called in sick that evening. So our poor waiter was left running around covering more tables that he normally does. We requested apple juice for my niece a few times with our main server  once from a supportive server and once from someone who seemed like a manager of some sort. We waited about twenty minutes for our main server and supportive server to bring the juice. Our main server told us once he had to go check on if and the other time he said he did put in our juice order but that juice came from the bar and they had not done it yet. I know the bar was working...as I saw plenty of patrons in the bar and surrounding tables with alcoholic drinks. Maybe our juice was made a low priority since it didn't make them as much money as the alcohol. After waiting twenty minutes with no juice we asked a manager for it and got our juice in 5 mins  right after our main server finally brought us our juice. Then we asked for soy sauce for my niece's rice  that took another 15 minutes to come up. Tonight's dinner was more waiting than eating which only took away from our family dinner experience. In the end the short staff was paid by a flustered waiter running around and hungry people at their tables. People hungry either from waiting for her food (if they were lucky) or waiting for their server go take their order (as was a majority of the tables. It would have been nice had management had a contingency plan in place to avoid such occurrences next time so that restaurant patrons don't have to pay the price of the restaurant being short staffed.It will be a long while  if at all  before I return
Ivan M.,Diamond Bar  CA,50,9,1,3/13/2017,4.0,We were seated quickly most likely because it was a monday night but the hostess was friendly! The food was good too  our salmon came out super burnt the first time but the second time it came out beautifully. What made this visit a great one was our server  Rudy. He was super patient in helping us with our order as well as dealing with the burnt salmon issue. Rudy went above and beyond to fix our minor little situation  and when it comes to diner satisfaction  the little things count. Rudy deserves to be recognized for that. Thank you Rudy!
Karina R.,El Monte  CA,0,3,,8/5/2017,3.0,Didn't have to wait for a table  which was good. Food we order to eat was fast and great. Our server BIANCA was doing good until the end. I decide to order to go but took too long of a wait and when the food came out a bag was not offer to us. The box was hot at the time and we had one left over box. To charge us she forgot the little black book  which she warn me she will bring it but had to wait for it. We felt like toward the end she forgot about us. Food was great But the service we got from her was slow.
Tom H.,Rosemead  CA,62,20,,11/17/2017,1.0,We've tried this BJ's a few times. All disappointing. We live really close to this BJ's but we drive 9 extra miles to the Puente Hills BJ's to get great service and amazing food. The service at the Montebello BJ's is terrible. Wait staff not friendly  if fact they make you feel like they are doing you a favor to serve you. We've had trouble with the servers listening to our order  getting the order correct and even simple things like drink refills. The food is just ok at this location. Once I ordered a burger. It was flattened  dry and over salted. I always ask for thousand island on the side because the burger comes dry. I can never get thousand island to come with my burger. In fact  it usually takes 2 or 3 requests to finally get it. This last visit  we arrived at 6pm during the week. They told us it would be a 10 minute wait. We said ok. We looked around inside  more than half the restaurant was empty. There were more BJ's employees than customers  so why the 10 minute wait? I've complained to the management there. They did apologize and said come back again. He said let me know in advance and we will make sure we take great care of you. I explained that wouldn't really solve the problem. It would fix our visit when you knew when we were coming. What about the times we don't tell you!!!
Omar R.,Whittier  CA,0,6,1,6/5/2017,1.0,Overall all I had a very bad experience at this location. Management team at the bar has very poor customer service skills. Seems like they just put anybody into management.
Brandi F.,Fullerton  CA,208,5,,6/3/2017,2.0,I love Bj's Brewhouse for the food but the service has never been great; tonight however it was atrocious. All I ordered tonight were 2 pizookies and not only did it take forever to come out  the cookie was not hot...I asked for water along with an order of coffee while ordering my pizookies and the pizookies came out before my water and coffee. Our waitress was named Julianna G and she was not attentive to us at all. I know it gets busy but honestly she was just so rude. Until of course she saw I was writing a review and started to become a kissass. Never coming back here and I highly suggest the same for others planning on eating here: don't.
Exie B.,Montebello  CA,5,13,4,5/26/2017,1.0,Terrible service during happy hour dirty tables you have to remind them to clear the tables so you can have a seat  waiters sit around by the bar talking in stead of attaining to customers the more I come here the worst the place get  this will be my last time here
Melody T.,Fullerton  CA,188,80,104,4/4/2016,5.0,Its funny how all the reviews on here have comments about the horrible service when my experience was just the opposite! Came here late night after work with a girlfriend  and our server Ephraim ( pretty sure not Ethan) was really cool. He told us how to get the $10 of a $35 bill on our phone and was super upbeat and friendly the entire time. I ordered an ahi tuna salad and told him not to include a bunch of things  as I'm a super picky eater. When I received my salad and began eating  I noticed there was still some cilantro inside. I don't know if he forgot to tell them  or they picked it out shoddily  but I absolutely can't stand the taste of even a little bit of cilantro. I didn't want to be that difficult customer  but I ended up telling him and he was super cool about it and said he would take it back and bring me something else. I really liked that he didn't make me feel guilty about being so picky or act annoyed. I then ordered the flat bread  which was pretty good ! All in all  I had a pretty good experience here  and was pleased with what I ordered as well as the service.
Jessica A.,Alhambra  CA,8,144,44,9/4/2017,1.0,I wish I could give more  but I cant. We decided to eat here because I have some dietary restrictions. I remember seeing an seared ahi salad on the menu so I knew that is what I was going to order. When we got there it was not busy and we were able to sit right away. The server came and greeted us. We asked for some water and I ordered the ahi salad right away. When I got the salad  I was a bit disappointed when I saw the tuna. The knife was not sharp at all  It looked like it got cut with a butter knife or a hacksaw. I couldn't eat most of tuna had so much sinew. I also noticed there wasn't any avocado on it and I asked the server if it came with avocado  and she said no. When I was getting towards the bottom of the salad  I noticed that there was so much dressing it looked like soup. The friend I was with ordered a burger with a beer. We had to flag down the server to ask for another one (isn't it the servers job to make sure to ask). My friend was not fully done with his burger when the server dropped the check. I looked at her and said that we haven't gotten his beer that we ordered and that my friend was still eating. She didn't seem to be concerned or care at all that she made us feel rushed. Again  it was not busy at all. Im not sure who told her it was proper to drop off a check when someone is still eating and waiting for another beer. With this said  I don't think I will be eating at bjs anytime soon.
Sylvia M.,Alhambra  CA,0,6,1,5/18/2017,1.0,This is a horrible place for dinner...it's so loud  you can't hear the person you're having dinner with! This place was so loud  there were people having dinner and the fool was offering his little kid some Here! Where's the manager??
Marina P.,Montebello  CA,96,2,,6/7/2017,1.0,This is the shittiest BJ's. The place is always over populated with rude ass people and the servers are the worst. I used to love coming here but since has been run down. The food is great YES  the beer is good YES. But that's BJ's. Go to ANY BJ's for the taste: this location in particular needs work on its service for sure. The staff has such a bad attitudes. Maybe it's having to serve the lame ass clientele this location attracts. 
Fiona C.,Rosemead  CA,140,15,10,3/31/2017,1.0,Racist as fuck. Came in tonight and they told us it's a 25 minute wait but we ended up waiting an hour before we got seated. After leaving us with the menu  nothing. Ignored us the entire time. I tried to wave a waitress down and she saw me but just stood there and ignored me. A lot of them were just standing around doing nothing but they just ignored us the entire time. We decided to just get up and leave and they didn't even bat an eyelash. They just looked as us while we walked out. 99% of their customers are probably Hispanic. Don't come in if you're asian.
Charlie A.,Los Angeles  CA,1,19,9,11/15/2016,1.0,I don't even know where to start with this review. First off today is a Tuesday (11/16/2016) the restaurant wasn't that packed so the service shouldn't have been as horrible as it was. My family and I walked in close to 6pm. We got seated and a couple mins later the waiter came and took our drink & appetizer order. We were off to a good start or so we thought. The drinks arrived and the waiter took our entree order. 15 mins later and still no sign of the appetizer or the waiter. Our entrees arrived but they forget my son's plate  we remind the waiter about my son's order and we tell him we no longer wanted the appetizer since it arrived late but he comes back and tells us it's on house (great right?). At this point the service still sucks since the waiter hasn't even offered refills on any of the drink orders  my husband calls the waiter and asked him for refills. Waiter comes back and this is where it all went to shit. I ordered an ice tea  it arrived and I start to drink it but my straw isn't picking up any tea  so I decide to stir it and that's when I see a big nasty glob of slime! If you have ever seen what placenta looks like picture that in your ice tea! That's what the glob looked like. We were so disgusted and puzzled as to what the f*%# this slimy glob was that we didn't take a picture. My husband calls the waiter and asked the waiter what the f*%# that is. The waiter is even more confused and disgusted than we are! He takes the ice tea and says he will find out. He comes back and couldn't tell us what it was but he apologized and said it was going to be taken off the bill! Ummm sorry but NO! You would think the manager would come and apologize and try to make things better. At this point I couldn't even finish the rest of my food. We had to call the manager over he gave a lame apology and couldn't even explain to us what the protocol was when something like this happens. I'm sorry but if it would of been a fly or even a roach in the ice tea at least we would of known what it was but the fact that this slimy glob was in the drink and no one could identify it is utterly disgusting and unacceptable. The meal was comped and we filed an incident report but I rather had paid and not had to deal with this. Never going back again.*Update it's been a MONTH and no one from Bj's has contacted me and that's okay I posted this all over social media and none of my friends & family will ever be stepping foot at any BJ's location. The lack of urgency goes to show what they think about their customers. Thanks Bj's!!!
Lynda R.,Covina  CA,12,16,1,4/10/2017,1.0,Probably one of my worst experiences at Bjs thanks to your server Patrick. Had to constantly ask him for lemons which we never received and food was brought out so late it was cold. It was also my friends bday and he never got his birthday pazookie after Patrick asked him what kind. Did not care to wait. Getting the bill was a hassle as well. I like coming to this bjs and it sucks that I have to go somewhere else and spend my money for now on.
Audrey L.,Covina  CA,141,3,,7/3/2017,5.0,I came here last night with my husband and had a great experience the food was very yummy but best of all the service was great our serve Steven Corona was soo friendly and helpful!!! I uploaded the Bjs app and got a free bazookie!!! We are eating healthy so we opt for healthier choices my husband got the Quinoa and chicken and I had the Barbacoa chicken with feta cheese and Greek yogurt and black beans only 560 cal so yummy!!! Highly recommend this dish and that server Steven Corona!!!
DrewsMom p.,San Gabriel  CA,9,41,4,4/23/2017,1.0,Terrible service tonight. We were here for over two hours what a waste. Drinks took forever. Food took forever. No one ever commented about how Long things were taking. No apologies  nothing. My husbands order was wrong. He ate three bites waitress never questioned why his food wasn't eaten when we questioned his order  she just said that's what he ordered and moved on. Paid way too much for a wrong dinner taking way too long. Wrote comments on the back of my receipt with my email address. Wonder if anyone will even reach out. We will never go here again.
A S.,Walnut  CA,362,47,26,6/25/2017,2.0,The food is mediocre and so is the service. The staff do not appear attentive. I understand it gets busy sometimes and it's difficult to keep up  but please actually make a genuine effort to be courteous.
Aaron A.,Downey  CA,17,18,1,4/3/2017,1.0,Was there this past saturday. Horrible customer service. The server couldn't find my assigned table because of the overlapping shift. Not once did she come by to offer us a refill or anything... we had to ask the buzz boy for water ketchup etc. I'd rather take my business elsewhere. I'd grade this as a negative ten!!!
Bai C.,El Monte  CA,0,1,,8/18/2017,1.0,This restaurant doesn't even deserve one star. Servers are rude. The people cleaning start cleaning and picking up items while people are still eating at the table.They tend to make a lot of mistakes when it comes to the food. I've been here about 12 times this year and the service is always horrible. I try coming here with an open mind and I try to take a lot into consideration. At this point management here needs to get it together the waitresses need to be better prepared. And for the people cleaning they should get some manners. Don't come here  go to Arcadia instead!
Lindsey N.,Fairfield  CA,71,19,1,4/9/2017,1.0,We were told that our wait would be 15 minutes and that they would text when our table was ready. Thirty minutes roll by and we went to check up on the status of our wait and they had 'forgot to text us
A M.,Los Angeles  CA,2,38,2,9/2/2017,1.0,Worst customer service. Im at my lunch and I'm at the takeout station. A worker says that someone will be right with me. Workers keep passing me by and no one comes to take my order. 20m waisted in waiting and no one is coming. #getittogetjerbjs never coming here for lunch.
Michael B.,Simi Valley  CA,1,37,3,4/6/2017,2.0,Not the best experience here folks. Poor service. Terribly long wait for drinks and food. Made me late getting back to work for lunch. When food did finally arrive  it was garbage. Very disappointed for a BJ's. Maybe dinner time is better. I gave it two stars because the server tried to deliver  he just couldn't.
Jasmin C.,Whittier  CA,3,12,3,2/23/2017,4.0,Came for lunch   it was super busy but we had an awesome waiter Nicko which made the waiting experience not so bad . He was attentive and sincere about us having to wait so long . Food was delicious.
Lucia P.,Hacienda Heights  CA,186,2,,7/1/2017,5.0,Steven C. was such a pleasure to have as a server. He was very attentive  very friendly and overall just knew how to do his job correctly. We'll definitely be coming back. And Steven if you're reading this  awesome job!
Mimi T.,Temple City  CA,48,3,,10/8/2016,1.0,Food was good! Service was horrible  horrible!!! Waitress Jessica C. was very unprofessional  unfriendly and rude!! We were there for lunch for the fact of Free Pizookie  we weren't offered until we asked for it  and Jessica was giving us attitude like we were there for free food!  We paid for our lunch!!! Jessica brought us the Pizookie and dropped it on the table  not a word of ENJOY or SORRY...She needs to be taught of basic manner before being a waitress.  I like BJs  but i would never go back to this location again.
Ojitos S.,Los Angeles  CA,772,44,226,1/30/2017,1.0,I honestly stopped going to BJ's when they got rid of their meatloaf which was the best ever! Last night we went to the one in Montebello since we were close by with friends. We sat in the bar area in a booth and we ordered our drinks and the waitress comes back to take our order which was 2 calmari  hot wings and small ribs. The server brings one order of calmari. A few minutes brings the ribs then my boyfriends gets up to find the waitress and oops she only got one order after we repeated the order smh then the server brings the hot wings which was supposed to be an order of 10 and there was 8 1/2 .... really! So my boyfriend calls the waitress to show her there is only 9 and a 1/2 of another and she picks up the plate and says I will get you another one with no apology. Then they bring the calamari she forgot and minutes later the wings so by then we were eating cold calamari smh I was irritated and hungry so we just ate. From the time they brought our first plate to the last was almost 20 min! When you order together they should bring the food at the same time. This was my worst experience ever at any BJ's and I would have called the manager to complain but we were running late for a concert in Anaheim. Great wings and cold calamari! I definitely will not return to this BJ's the service was bad and the worst part is that I did not get her name.
Krystal Z.,Los Angeles  CA,69,39,,8/5/2016,1.0,I've been to bjs several times when it first opened and thought I'd go again for lunch with some family  bad call. We were seated and I though all was well when we received our drinks. .. it wasn't till it came to the food. Our orders were wrong  it took forever for them to be corrected  it took 30minutes for ranch and we waited so long for the check we had to demand it from the hostess because any other waiter we encountered were just ignoring us! I'm pretty understanding when it comes to food service because I've worked as both server and hostess  but when your rude  slow and the restaurant is slow... What is your excuse?!
D M.,Monterey Park  CA,0,2,,6/17/2017,1.0,Waited for my take out for over 30min! Server knew my food was ready  but ignored me while I was standing there waiting in plain site. Pretty sad. Asked how long my food was waiting  and she commented she was waiting for my side. Really? It takes 30min for my side dish?? Just BS!6/17/17 waited 8:50-9:30
Vince B.,Covina  CA,52,12,,6/16/2017,2.0,One of the best parts of on-line order is being able to arrange what time you will be picking up your food. One of the worst parts of on-line order is when you food isn't ready at the time specified. I'd arranged for an 11:45 a.m. pickup - paid for it at 11:30  but still had to wait over 10 minutes. Sure - not the end of the world  but still very frustrating as I had picked the time for specific scheduling  and it was a inconvenience to have to wait.
C J S.,Shafter  CA,0,23,2,6/4/2017,3.0,The food is very good here but the place is not fun to dine at as the place has terrible accoustics which makes conversations difficult. The menu has many options and their tortilla soup and salads are delicious.
Demi C.,Long Beach  CA,451,5,,2/8/2017,4.0,Although my boyfriends jambalaya was missing the shrimp  James was an amazing server. He got us a side of shrimp to make up for the missing shrimp. He was so nice and made sure we were happy and feed. I will come back just for his service!!
Fannie B.,Redondo Beach  CA,25,133,60,2/9/2017,1.0,Bad service  mediocre food. We were a large group of 20 for lunch. Some people in our group never even received their lunch or drinks. The place was empty so not sure why they could not provide good service. Very sad. Will not return to this location.
Patty L.,Pico Rivera  CA,1,8,,5/4/2017,5.0,One of the best customer services  & the food was so yummy. The price is not too overwhelming  either. I'd go again!
Jose T.,El Monte  CA,0,2,,5/19/2017,4.0,"My wife and I love to come here for lunch or dinner. We\'re big fans of the BJ Signature deep dish pizza. But my favs gotta be the pepper BBQ ribs. They got the right amount of ""POW"" to them. Service is great all the time."
Tim M.,Montebello  CA,200,129,419,2/22/2016,4.0,I've been going here for a few years now since it first opened.. this place always has good food and good service. Typical BJ's food and menu. I like the pizzas and appetizers. Some of my favorites are the santa fe rolls and stuffed mushrooms.This location has large TV walls and regular and late night happy hour. They also have a good selection of beers on tap along with a full bar. Good place to watch a game and have pizza and beers!
L V.,Stanton  CA,0,5,,9/3/2017,1.0,Omg  the service here is sooooo slow. Our server took a long time to get our order and the food took forever to arrive. We also lost our server until the time we have to pay. She did not checked if we need anything. I'm very disappointed with this location
Vic C.,Duarte  CA,104,2326,8399,1/14/2015,4.0,"This BJ\'s Restaurant is located at The Shops at Montebello (formally the Montebello Mall)  specifically located right next to JcPenny. (Review is for To Go Order only) Decided to make a to go order for lunch for both my husband and myself this early afternoon. I called to make a to go order before leaving work (I work pretty close by this place) and was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes. This is what we had:Mahi Mahi Tacos- ($9.50 prior to tax) I had the option of having my mahi mahi tacos grilled or fried and decided to opt for grilled (healthier option). This entree comes with 2 tacos and chips (with avocado cream sauce and fire roasted tomato salsa packed in a separate container). I really liked my mahi mahi taco. The chipotle mayo added a little spice to it (which was plenty spicy for this non spicy eating person) but my husband added a bit of sriracha to it. I thought the fish was nice and tender. The shredded Napa cabbage and carrots added a nice crunch to it. The chips were just ""eh"". I have had better chips from the market. Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad- ($9.75 prior to tax) This salad is pretty good with the different flavors and textures. Not only is there kale and roasted Brussels sprouts but also blueberries  sliced red grapes  dried cranberries  candied pecans  chopped cucumbers and toasted pepitas. This salad also comes with goat cheese and red onions but I requested to omit this. I love the sweetness and flavor from the fruit and the strawberry vinaigrette enhances that light sweetness throughout each bite. My dressing automatically came on the side since this was a to go order  but if I dined in  I would normally ask for salad dressing on the side (don\'t like my salad swimming in dressing... kind of defeats the whole purpose of eating healthy). When I arrived exactly 15 minutes later (told you I work close to this BJ\'s location) after I placed my to go order  it took another 10 minutes to pick up my order since there was a person ahead of me making an order and the computer system was moving slow (according to the employee who was helping me with my transaction). Making my order to go over the phone was easy  along with pick up. I like that you can also have the option of making a to go order online as well  but I didn\'t want to use my cell phone data to do that for this visit. (They have free  fast WiFi here by the way).Overall  had a fantastic lunch with my husband at a price that was reasonable. Will have to come back for a dine in experience some time."
Elizabeth G.,Pico Rivera  CA,250,6,,9/2/2017,1.0,My review is a accumulation of visits into one. This is by far the worst BJ's location. Only thing giving it a star is the conveniency of the location as a meet up point for my friends. Waiters and server are just terrible. One visit  I ordered a mini pazookie took more than one hour to receive it. I had the same waitress twice after that and never had a good dining experience with her. Another visit  we never got a refill on our drinks until after we were done eating. Oh and once we were done eating the table was never bussed. The empty plates sat in front of us for at least 20 minutes before we finally got the attention of our waiter. (We were so kind enough to stack them on top for him *sarcasm) Another visit  the waitress kept forgetting everything  mixed up orders  and etc. The manager even admitted our table wasn't the only one who made a comment. It was not a good experience. So yeah this location is a no for me and has been for awhile. I recommend BJ's Downey location. Best to management.
Kenneth S.,Los Angeles  CA,2,39,127,8/19/2017,4.0,This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit and have good food and watch the games on tv. The staff is always nice and professional and take great care of us when we visit. We ordered the pepperoni  sausage and mushroom pizza and it was excellent as always. Our server was Kristian and she was nice  had a smile on her face and professional. Looking forward to visiting again.
Emiko H.,Rosemead  CA,254,26,8,4/1/2017,1.0,My friends and I come to bjs occasionally to do celebrations for birthdays  New Years  and coworker dinner parties. This is the first time ever coming in and leaving with anger and confusion. We came in on Friday night and was told that our wait was about 20 minutes; but instead  my friends and I waited over an hour to be seated. It didn't really bother us because it was a bit crowded so it was understandable. But what confused me was that no waiter/waitress came up to let us know that he/she would be serving us that night. We looked around and tried to flag down a server but were ignored countless times. One worker stood by the pos system while the other 5-6 waiters were on the other side near the stairs just talked amongst themselves while they stared at the customers. Excuse me? My friend raised her hand to get service but instead of being attended to   she was completely ignored by the waitress even though we clearly saw her eyed our table. What I don't get was that if she wasn't our server  why couldn't she let our server know that we are ready to order? We sat there for over 30 minutes plus the hour we've waited for our table. We were all hungry and pissed off so we stood up to leave. As we walked out  not one server gave a damn and just watched us leave. What a complete waste of our freakin time. This will be the last time any of us will be back. We will also be sure to let our friends and family know of our experiences because why should anyone support a restaurant that doesn't care about their customers.
Lynette V.,Whittier  CA,0,1,,8/9/2017,5.0,This place was great. The food was amazing I got the fettuccine Alfredo with a side of fries. The fries were the best fries ever. And the pasta was a great size of a lunch special. And the bread it can with was amazing. Will absolutely come back.
Gigi g.,Los Angeles  CA,185,59,26,1/31/2017,1.0,Hostess was rude. Did not even acknowledged us. So we went to the bar area to seat ourselves. When we sat  we were asked for ID. I was with my 19 year old daughter. I know of you serve food in a restaurant you can have minors on a bar area. We just wanted food.
Aer D.,Park La Brea  CA,6,68,17,3/2/2017,1.0,Food came at all different times. Do not get the ahi salad. Dressing drenched the wilted leaves  plate was dirty and soiled with grease  ahi tuna smelled fishy  and it was overly vinegary. Pickled cucumbers worsened the dish. Tomato chunks were too huge in size.
Ryan J.,Tracy  CA,0,11,7,5/6/2017,4.0,Just another BJ's. Nothing special but the bartenders are definitely above average. This BJ's is located inside the Montebello Mall next to the 60. You cant go wrong with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.
Carlos R.,Pico Rivera  CA,0,13,2,5/1/2017,4.0,Very good ambiance. Very good service. Calamari appetizer very good. Nutty brunette beer & Jeremiah red a must try.
Rebecca G.,Buena Park  CA,111,7,3,7/1/2017,1.0,Had never been to this location before. My husband's work friends chose it for a send off dinner for him. I get we had a very large group on a busy night so we expected the service to be a little slow but to wait 30 minutes for a beer after asking for it 2-3 times  40 minutes for checks and being over charged for stuff that wasn't ordered. And the service was flat out rude. I was engaged in a conversation with my husband and one server came with a drink and set it right between us and didn't even have the decency to pour after she behaved to rudely(it was a split of prosecco)Its clear that the servers here are poorly trained and/or overworked. These servers need to be retrained in the art of customer service. The food was ok. We ordered nachos and wings. There was no guac on the nachos so we ordered a side of guac. The guac had CELERY in it! Who puts celery in guacamole!? A cheap ass restaurant trying to stretch ingredients and skimp on quality  that's who. I sent it back and the server tried to save face by saying  oh its a mix that they put in. Uh no bitch  that shit was ground up and mixed in. Clearly  in an effort to stretch it out. At least try your shit before you serve it. Also  celery is not a typical ingredient. What happens when you serve that to someone with an allergy to celery? Good luck with that one. If I'm ever in the area again I'll choose Olive garden instead....and I don't even like Olive garden's food.
Kevin W.,Temple City  CA,496,1767,7725,2/19/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,BJ's has some pretty good brews!Blonde - $5.25 HopStorm IPA - $5.75Chicken Ranch Mini Deep Dish Pizza - $6 - Awesome happy hour item. You get a 6 inch pizza of your choice. Chicken ranch was a nice twist on the normal ddp. Crust is good and the cheese that crisps up on the edges was delicious. The ranch drizzle on top added a nice creamy flavor.
Orlando S.,Long Beach  CA,1280,29,1,12/11/2016,1.0,Tonight I ordered a Kale & Brussel Sprout Salad for take out. I picked it up and when I got home  the shrimp in the salad was ice cold  not blackened as I asked  and there was only four in the salad. I called and was immediately transferred to Ryan the manager. This guy started making excuse after excuse as to why the salad was made wrong and when I asked for my money back  he told me i'd have to get in contact with the general manager. Tomorrow I plan on calling corporate and getting my money back. I will NEVER order from this place again until Ryan is no longer an employee of this restaurant.
Dania D.,Los Angeles  CA,51,8,1,4/1/2017,5.0,Amazing service! Definitely the best BJ's I been to. My boyfriend and I have date night on Thursday and this is our go to spot. DEF RECOMMEND
Marissa A.,Monrovia  CA,0,1,,8/10/2017,5.0,We had a waiter named Daniel. He took over from our previous waiter while he went to break and took very good care of our table all the way til we ended our night.. and sang a great happy birthday song all by himself. Definitely love bjs and there drinks and food.. and good service. That is Daniel!
art D.,Whittier  CA,85,8,,3/27/2017,1.0,I was just watching the commercial and wow BJs looks so good! It makes me sad that whenever I try this place the service has been so bad I will never go back again. Last time I was there I ordered a calzone and it was ice cold in the middle and they heated it up twice for me and it was still not cooked all the way. I had to pay a full bill and I did not even touch the calzone I was so grossed out. I couldn't get out of their fast enough  just a very bad vibe. And the service was extremely slow. I hate to complain or write a bad review but that commercial brought back that feeling of bitter disappointment. Hopefully their service has gotten better  but my experience was terrible.
Tiffany C.,Pico Rivera  CA,1,86,29,2/14/2017,1.0,This is the fifth time I ordered to go and the fifth time they messed up my order. I asked for a half and half pizza. Half NO onions and NO olives...well guess what...I opened the box and found onions and olives. Thanks for nothing BJ's. Seriously-get it right.
Janelle G.,Monterey Park  CA,52,252,56,1/1/2016,1.0,"This is my first time at this BJ\'s. The service is HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn\'t keep track of how many servers helped us. One girl sat us down  another came to our table  who claimed to be our waitress. A few minutes later another waitress came and said she was taking over for our first waitress. We ordered our drinks  which took about 20 minutes to get. Some guy brought out our drinks  another guy brought out my soup  then ANOTHER guy brought out our entrees. My deep dish ziti was not so ""deep."" It was basically a few noodles with a gob of cheese with a cup full of grease on the bottom. The ""waitress"" never came to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else. The tables are ridiculously close together. It can\'t possibly be safe in there if an emergency happened!!!! I WILL NOT be returning to this BJ\'s!!!!"
Sally C.,Santa Fe Springs  CA,0,22,2,7/22/2017,1.0,Sat down very quickly. Server never came  no waters  no acknowledgement of any kind. We got up to leave and told the hostess that nobody came to attend to us. No apology and very indifferent if we stayed or left. Terrible service!! We walked to the sushi place and we were taken care of ASAP! BJ  you suck and I won't go back.
Lori M.,Costa Mesa  CA,125,4,1,7/26/2017,2.0,Good food HORRIBLE service. As soon as we sit down we notice the waiter was going to deliver anything but good service and we were right. We get our food and it was great all of our orders for that matter. Which made us overlook the waiters horrible customer service. Until it wasn't. Our Pizookie was rock hard. So I decide to say something to the waiter. Only thing  no waiter. He had checked us out before we got our dessert  which made me realize he wasn't coming back. So I go up to a waiter and what seemed to be a manager and let them know and they say ok sorry we'll send one right out. 20 mins later still no Pizookie. I go ask again and this time they did bring it out fairly quickly. What made it great.. as we were leaving the manager asked us if the second Pizookie was better. I told him  after waiting over 25 mins .. and he says but was it good? Just not the best customer service. But overall the food was delicious  second Pazookie was better. I do want to add that our server (gentleman that brought out the food) was amazing!!!! Wish he was our waiter !!!
Rizzomar ..,Arcadia  CA,0,19,4,8/22/2016,4.0,This is my 4th time coming to BJs. I really love the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne. The hot and spicy wings have an intense smell because of the sauce but they are pretty good too. This place gets very busy but the food has been good so far. The service is nice too. My fianc ordered an Avacodo burger which he loved. This place is definitely an option for us when we want to eat out.
Carol D.,Rosemead  CA,91,2,,12/8/2016,1.0,All right  where to begin... Service was bad; our waitress seemed to forget about us entirely for half the time spent here. Our food was delivered by someone else  and we had to flag down a busboy for utensils. That  unfortunately  was the best part of my experience. My biggest issue was the food poisoning I contracted from the meal. I had the Baby Back Pork Ribs with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts  and my boyfriend had the BJ's Classic Rib-Eye. We both got sick  but I had to miss work the next day on account of horrible nausea  muscle pain  and fever. Suffice it to say we will never be returning to this location again.
Lizbeth M.,Downey  CA,0,12,8,6/6/2017,2.0,My experience was ruined before I even arrived at the place. Customer service is not a priority here. I called to ask what the wait time was for a party of 7 and was told they can't give an accurate wait time for over a party of 6. When I asked for the wait time for a party of 6  I was hung up on!!! I tried calling again  this time simply asking the wait time for a party of 6  and I was told 15 minutes. 5 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and the wait time was 2 hours. I understand a lot can change in 5 minutes  but that was RIDICULOUS! I was so fed up I ended up picking up fast food and eating at home. Terrible customer service.
E L.,Alhambra  CA,313,220,137,1/23/2017,4.0,This place is always great for their Tatonka stout. That's probably the only beer I would recommend. Food is okay. Always try to sit at the bar since you'll get better and faster service. They have late night happy hour also. Usually the beer was $4 a pint but i think its closer to $5.00 or $5.50 now. Very clean and spacious place. Good place to watch sports at the bar area.
Renee C.,Los Angeles  CA,78,18,5,7/12/2016,1.0,I decided to drop in  solo  after shopping at the mall. I walked in to see four ladies standing at the front counter they greeted me and when I informed them that I was a party of 1 for dinner I was told that I could find a seat at the bar  because it was happy hour.I hesitated for a moment but was not offered another option. I asked if there were tables available. They said they didn't know but I could seat myself anywhere.I I walked to the bar area and although there were pub tables  I turned around and walked out. Not one comment from the four ladies there. I know that front desk is a sturdy piece of furniture that does not require 4 bodies to hold it up.I will be withdrawing from their email list. An email was what brought me in this evening.
Aly B.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,2,2/17/2017,5.0,I've been coming to this location for over 8 years and truly have never been disappointed with my food or service  staff is always so friendly and attentive. My Boyfriend and I had dinner today and we were served by Nicklus he was more than friendly and helpful of all our needs he went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of constantly asking how we were doing  we got our food in not time and he was on top of his game refilling our drinks. This review is way over due but it felt like the right time! Thank you BJ's for your Delicious food and outstanding service.
Rachel H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,47,9,6/26/2015,2.0,Sundays  Fathers day  was a wonderful experience. Not crowded  we were seated fast. Came back on Tuesday night  3 of us  the experience was horrible  the waitress had attitude  we ordered drinks  my drink was not my drink  i returned it. then we ordered a small dish (see picture) burnt  they burnt it!!!
Jose S.,East Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,22,14,65,7/1/2016,5.0,A regular at this place. Love the food and the service. Brussels sprouts on point. Recomendable appetizers.
Julie L.,Los Angeles  CA,1,13,3,1/22/2017,1.0,Horrible experience  they had a problem with my to go order and when I asked for the manager  they bring me the KITCHEN MANAGER.. how unprofessional is that? and he's shirt was all dirty like really . I was a loyal customer from this location until yesterday. I don't need managers to give me attitude like if I was asking for free food . I will take my money elsewhere.
Shaun B.,Montebello  CA,0,3,7,8/19/2016,2.0,Service was incredibly slow  we came here for a quick meal at 8:30  were seated at 8:45  it is now 11:05 and our server Martin G has disappeared once again for almost 10 minutes after giving us the check.I ordered a BJs favourite deep dish pizza which was quite average - not bad  but not great either.The wife ordered the fish & chips  of which the chips were ok but the fish was so overcooked and had so much batter it was basically fossilized.We will not be coming back.
Luis C.,Pomona  CA,0,10,1,1/17/2017,2.0,Went to this location on Martin Luther Kings  Day a bit busy services was a bit slow we ordered a pitcher of beer are glasses were very dirty had to replace them twice flatware was also very dirty spotted and had dry food on it pretty gross. pizza was good and so were the appetizers. Received our bill they did not give us the discount for happy hour we had to complain they did change it after a bit of complaining I don't think I'll be come back to this location. The West Covina location is much better.
Elizabeth G.,Rosemead  CA,2,12,133,7/5/2016,3.0,Family friendly restaurant with a big selection of menu items. Their pizzas are very good. Loud atmosphere with televisions for watching sports. Good bar selection of beers as well. I always get their pazookis. Great dessert! Service is a hit or miss. Always crowded. Make reservations before you get there. Wait can be long at times. Overall  the quality of the food is descent and I would come back to explore other dishes.
Edward R.,Los Angeles  CA,47,131,437,11/11/2015,4.0,I have came to this BJ's many times and never have any problems with their service. The server usually is good about following up and checking if everything is well and if we need anything at all. The appetizer comes out first and devour it prior to our main entrees. I recommend this location since I have never had any issues and rate them with a 4 star.
Dora C.,Montebello  CA,0,17,,7/11/2017,2.0,There were three of us in the bar area sitting at a booth. Our waitress took such a long time to take our order for drinks and took even longer to take our order for food. She only came around once to check on us . Our food which was only a few appetizers took even longer. It was a frustrating experience and we felt bad for the other servers who helped us because we couldn't find our waitress. Won't be returning there for happy hour.
Javie M.,Montebello  CA,0,7,,1/11/2017,5.0,This BJ's is great always go here with the babe  good for a date or family dinners. They are on top of there refill game they don't ask they just bring your drink.
Veronica M.,San Gabriel  CA,7,28,2,12/27/2016,4.0,We love this place !! I like the shrimp tacos wow excellent food my favorite place to eat
Jon O.,Lakewood  CA,16,17,64,1/9/2016,5.0,We love Bjs and are members. Staffs are always great every where. Food is fantastic and beer is cold. The tavern cut pizza  itialian market good with a house blonde. Gladys gets the ahi tuna salad every time. Distinctively good wings. Get the sauces on the side  and a side of pot stickers.
Sandra J.,La Mirada  CA,2,2,,6/23/2017,5.0,We had a party of 16 water polo players on Fathers day and they accommodated us last minute!
Victor G.,Commerce  CA,58,5,,2/3/2017,1.0,I came here to get my self a shot of Jamison with a pickle back. The bartender told me I couldn't get a pickle back cause it was in the back this the Second time I come and I have a bad experience. Why can't this bjs be more Friendly like the one in downy they are awesome over there.
Kathy M.,San Gabriel  CA,152,9,21,6/20/2016,3.0,The hosts were friendly and welcoming. We were told we would be seated in a few minutes  which we were. The host that guided us to our seat walked in a nice timely manner. Jimmy then greeted us as our server and took our drink orders.Here is where it turned a little bad. A different server came and took our food order. We got our food order in a timely fashion. Between getting sat and placing our order  we never got our table settings (napkin and silverware). So I kindly asked our server for some settings. He came back a few minutes with one fork. I then asked if we can get two settings  with the napkins and silverware. He looked at me with a confused look  but when he returned with what I've asked for  there was some attitude given back at me. I also asked for some ketchup and Tabasco. It took about 3 minutes to get the condiments. I understand how servers work. I also understand how some customers are jerks  but that doesn't mean to push it onto other customers. I set my glass on the side for a refill. He took my glass hoping to get it refilled. Nope. I waited over 5 minutes before asking a busser for a refill.When we were done eating and received the bill  that was when I found out his name  Carlos. It wasn't until we paid our bill that he became super friendly.Overall  food was great  but the service can be better.
Janell C.,Los Angeles  CA,7,26,1,3/5/2016,2.0,I really don't know why we came here. Not my favorite. We were invisible.  The service was awful. The server was some young kid that looked like I bothered cause I was ready to order.  He didn't roll his eyes but I was waiting. Never again. Soooooooo disappointed.  Beer was cold. I guess that's the two stars. Flip this joint.
Oliver C.,Whittier  CA,0,21,2,5/1/2017,1.0,Idk how many times I'll let myself be disappointed by this place if it's not one thing it's the other.  The run down; 11:30 get there sit at the bar that has 3 other people  bartender takes a good 5 minutes to acknowledge me too busy chattin. Then they've changed their happy hour again no longer $5 call drinks. Now it's $1 off WOW a whole dollar! And TWO off of apps. Hardly can be considered a happy hour  maybe slightly makes up for the unprofessional and straight shitty service by all staff. Took way longer than expected for spinach dip when restaurant was empty. At 1130 they turn up the lights!!! It closes at 12. The manager who looked bitter didn't once smile or acknowledge a single guests existence even thou I was staring at him trying to get his attention to say something about my so far shitty experience. He just went behind the bar and told the bartender to close up his tabs. Mind you the place is suppose to be open till midnight and it's not past 1140. The tender tells the new guests they have 5 minutes to order  I didn't know they stopped serving food 15 minutes before they close. Or did the staff just wanna go home?? I work in the industry. There's no excuse for this behavior they didn't even try  they didn't give a rats ass about anyone or anything other than getting outta there. You're a manager!!! You should be acknowledging every guest! At least try and fake a smile. You are in the wrong industry man. HOSPITALITY! it's the way you make one feel during the transsction. I felt upset  frustrated   bitter  not cared about  rushed and ripped off. Definetly unsatisfied to say the least. Not ideals. Thanks bald bitter manager who hates his job and Cesar who made me wait too long for my drink because he was busy either ignoring my existence or talking. Manager turned off music and tvs before my phone even read 12! Never. Again
Darlene Q.,Temple City  CA,15,241,58,10/4/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,They don't even deserve a star for the wu their bathroom is. A lot of dtalls didn't have toilet paper and there was paper all over the floor. The toilet seats were also dirty. Where's the person who's supose to keep the bathroom clesn?
Amelia L.,San Gabriel  CA,6,19,,4/27/2017,2.0,My experience with BJ's has been up and down  never consistent. I had visited this restaurant with my family before and received exceptional service. I don't understand why this time was different. Our female server  don't know her name but she wears glasses  was enthusiastic at first and seemed prompt and friendly  but her attitude gradually fell along with the service she gave us. We ordered two hickory barbecue burgers  a parmesan crusted chicken  a salmon entree  a sandwich  and a large pizza. The pizza was the first to come  which took me by surprise because it usually takes the most time to arrive. Twenty minutes had passed and the entrees started to arrive one by one. I ordered a well done burger and I received medium rare. My dad's sandwich hadn't arrived yet  but the table next to us ordered the same sandwich and his arrived first (even though they were sat 20 minutes after us). I think they made a mistake and gave the sandwich to them instead. After the food arrived  our server stopped checking up on our table. We saw her jumping from table to table  but never checked up on us. We had to wave down a bus boy to ask where my dad's sandwich was because everyone's food had arrived. 30 minutes later  we decided to ask for a manager and he came to our table. We told him that my burger was made incorrectly  and didn't receive the sandwich. Another 20 minutes passes  but at this point our server was avoiding our table because we complained about our service. We thought she did it on purpose because she felt embarrassed. But my question is  she is our server and if she made a mistake  she should be the one to apologize for the inconvenience. Why was she acting like a child by avoiding us. She kept checking up on the surrounding tables  but never made an effort to stop by us until the very end to drop off the check. They took off the sandwich from the bill  but we told the manager there was no need to do that because we weren't looking for a free meal  we just wanted our food. We did appreciate the effort  but it came too late. Instead of making up for it at the end and apologizing  make the moment right and do something about it when the time comes. We could have gone to other restaurants  but we chose this one because of a previous experience. This is unacceptable. Will not be dining here for while and will visit the Arcadia location instead.
Abigail Abby D.,Corona  CA,81,6,1,1/4/2017,2.0,Terrible service. They have this new texting where they text you when your table is ready and once they send the text  they will only hold it for three minutes. We checked for our table because we have been waiting more than the 30 minutes that they estimated and they said they texted us. We didn't get it and they didn't call us and we were standing right next to them. When we went up to ask  they didn't even look at us.
Jessica W.,Alhambra  CA,2,90,186,7/18/2015,4.0,I ordered the chicken tenders with crispy thin fries and the sparkling raspberry lemonade. They were both good. The waitress was friendly. I wouldn't mind coming here again.
Alex M.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,118,384,1727,4/8/2015,3.0,It was Saturday night after just leaving a comedy show and we were looking for somewhere to eat. We seen that this place was still open so we popped on in. The bar is open seating so we got a booth for the two of us. We sat and our waiters walked right up and introduced herself. She was carry happy  attentive and very polite. After looking over the menu we ordered. We started with fried artichokes that are awesome but don't forget to ask for extra dipping sauce. My fiancee had a Thai chicken salad that they forgot to put the chicken in. The waitress was kind enough to bring some out for the salad after told it was missing. I had the California burger cooked medium. It was delicious. Meat cooked just right  flavorful and juicy with wedge cut fries. Although they forgot the chicken in the salad we will be back. It's never disappointed before.
Sharon A.,South Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,8,2,,1/13/2017,1.0,The servers were amazing  however the cook is lazy and doesn't care about the quality of the food he serves  I gave him 2 not one but 2 chances to pre pair eatible food and he could not the jumbolia was burnt and flavorless disgusting and then I order the salmonand that came back horrible I'm not sure if he was tired or what but I was served dinner way after my family so now I'm the spectacle at the table because the are done they had pizza and a burger I quess fine cuisine it's not in his ability as a chef he sucks and the experience thank you but no thank you I will not be coming back here ever
Danny L.,Monterey Park  CA,519,214,256,4/27/2015,3.0,Man back in high school BJ's use to be the place to be! I don't know if my expectations are higher or I was just nave  but BJ's just isn't that great anymore.The servers are always very courteous  but not very attentive. Last time I was there our server came 4 times and we were there for like 3 hours. First time for drinks  second time for food  third time for dessert  and the last was for the check. Maybe it is their policy not to bother their diners too much so they can enjoy their meal in peace or they are just under staffed. Either way  I think they should check up on all their diners more often. My 3 star rating is mainly cause of the food. First the food takes forever to come out! If you are looking for a quick meal before going out or watch a movie  this is not the place to be. So make sure to grab one of their house beers  which are pretty good  sit back and relax.I have had a lot of different main courses here - pizza  burgers  and pasta. Every main dish I have tried here is extremely salty yet still pretty bland. I definitely prefer their appetizer menu over their main courses. I like their the avocado rolls and spinach & artichoke dip.Oh and their pizookies are bomb.com!
Bryant R.,Montebello  CA,178,2,,7/9/2016,1.0,1. Their pasta is straight garbo. I feel like those people who get catfished  who think someone looks fire but realize it was the filters that created the illusion. The pasta looked dumb flames on the menu  but in real life  na. It taste like it was forgotten in mad max truck  as he drove across the dessert for safety. I mean  I'm still going to eat it. But I'll have to warm some of that vegan tomato basil sauce at my crib tomorrow....as a pasta enthusiast  I ain't feeling it. Little cousin said it was unnecessarily spicy. 2. Table service  trash ! 3. This man gave us one ranch  for 3 people. Do the math. 4. The boneless wings  messed up or order  and they barely have bbq on them. Also  one ranch!5. Sliders are alright  remind me of my school lunch.6. My friend is thirsty. He ran out of his drink. Again  bad service and the flat bread pizza  ugh. 1 star. Just hit the Pollo loco.
Garrett J.,Duarte  CA,0,17,1,7/1/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,The waitress seemed put out that I was there. When my pizza came out it wasn't cut. Only when I asked another waitress for utensils she noticed it wasn't cut and took it back. When my pizza returned it was a mess. The original waitress just flopped it down over my shoulder and walked away. Horrible customer service. There is a picture of what happen to my pizza. **Reply to manager. I did ask to speak to someone. That's when all of a sudden she was friendly and was trying to do everything but get one. At that point I offered to pay for he soda and just left. I understand when it's busy and you can tell the staff mind is a little off. It's ok because there is a reason. It wasn't busy that day.
Jenn N.,West Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,162,20,40,1/17/2016,2.0,The food and service at this location is absolutely underwhelming. As much as BJ's try to to be diverse with their menu  if you order anything other than pizza and beer  you'll be disappointed. Their salad selection isn't too bad either. Basically stay away from anything that requires some culinary skills. Its safe to stay with the fresher menu items such as their salads as they're required to keep things fresh. Their pizza selection is basically the only sure thing on their menu.
Xochitl G.,Los Angeles  CA,12,43,10,7/22/2016,2.0,Staff was nice and friendly  however our order was all wrong  my beer was hot  we had all got our food except for my little nephew we waited and waited. I got pizza and salad. I was disappointed by the pizza nothing but bread salad was meh. My daughter ordered the broccoli and cheese soup which was absolutely delicious. It was a bitter sweet experience.
Melody C.,Los Angeles  CA,44,119,198,4/11/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I really like BJ's. My 3 stars are only because the Grilled Salmon I ordered had to be sent back  not once but twice. I finally just asked to have it removed from the check. I've had it here before and it was good. Maybe they were just having an off night but whoever was cooking the fish last night around 5PM needs a little refresher course.Otherwise the ribs were good and the Brussels sprout and kale salad was enjoyable. I tried a new BJ's root beer and liked it too.
Phillip G.,Downey  CA,0,11,2,11/29/2016,1.0,Service here was horrible went in on a game night and the waiter took forever to take our food order then when I ordered my beer it was flat. (Maybe they do this intentionally since everyone is getting drunk for the game) Our server them comes and tells us he is going on lunch and tells us another server will take care of us but yet throughout the whole time we see him still working! Manager can see that we are upset and we can tell he does his best to avoid us! My gf usually gets mad at me when I complain and get mad but this time she was even upset about the service as well! Then they use my reward points for stuff that I never received. I talk to management and his excuse is we are busy how can that be your excuse is you are a huge restaurant chain and it's not like this is your first night you ever get busy!!! Service here was just horrible and management is just as bad!!!
Melissa Z.,Monterey Park  CA,127,4,2,11/26/2016,1.0,"Alright so the first time I came to this BJ\'s it was with my friend. We were seated in a booth  which was pretty cool. Service was good  good was great everything fine. Which is what the star is for. SECOND time I came here was tonight with my family for my brothers birthday. So  we wait about 5-10 mins to be seated which is no problem. Then they seat us at this small table next to the pilar where all the waiters walk so that was annoying. My mom wanted a booth to put her purse so she didn\'t have to hold it  but we decided to stay. Then  our waitress comes and says ""I\'ll be right with you for drinks I just have to greet this other family"" or something like that. And we never see her again. We sit and wait and watch everyone else get drinks  food while we sit there hungry and irritated. Then another waitress comes  and you can tell she was not our new waitress because she took our order on the back of a receipt. We order drinks and food because we\'ve been waiting so long and were hungry. Another 10-15 mins pass and still no drinks. Finally we get them and we drink  and wait another 10-20 mins now and as soon as we were about to get up and walk out  they bring our food. Then the part of the table that is extra and folded under falls and hits my mom right on her knees. We ask for the manager who had the best attitude of the night and fixed it. My mom asked a waitress for mustard and I promise she looked at my mom like she was from another planet then went ""...yea"" and left. So rude. We ate and waited again for the birthday pizookie for my brother which was not that long of a wait. He eats that then we leave. The food here is good  but this bad service and rude attitudes left a nasty taste in my mouth about this restaurant and I don\'t think I\'ll come back anytimesoon."
Vishnu And Emily S.,Irvine  CA,19,50,82,7/21/2015,4.0,I ordered the calamari appetizer and the clam chowder bread bowl. They were both delicious. The only issue I had with this place was that the waitress took forever with everything. We waited around for our bill for about 5-10 minutes after we asked for it. And after we put our credit card down  we waited another 5-10 minutes to get our receipt and card back.I like that while you wait  if there is a wait  you can just go shop in the mall. Very convenient. Great location.
Cristian G.,Pomona  CA,85,22,1,7/16/2017,1.0,This place is pretty sad. My wife and I are new to the area  and were happy that there was a BJs Brewhouse in our neighborhood. Welp  we weren't happy for long. We arrived here about 8pm on a Sunday night. The place was not too busy when we arrived  but I couldnt help but notice that it was in disarray. There was quite a few pieces of trash on the floor in every direction I looked. We waited to be seated. I headed to the bathroom to wash my hands  of course in here there was trash all over the floor as well. So I went back to find my seat. I noticed when I sat down facing my wife  there were a childs hand prints all over the booth right next to my wifes head. It looked like the booth wasnt really cleaned. On my side there was trash on the seat. Anyways we were just there for dessert  and would be on our way shortly thereafter. The waiter took a little longer than expected to arrive. He took our order for one chocolate chunk pizookie and left. He brought us some water shortly after. It took about 20 mins for the pizookie to arrive. Once it was delivered we never saw our waiter again. We ate the dessert and waited  and waited. No one came to bring a check  or see if we needed anything else (we were never given napkins). So after waiting for about 15 mins i just left cash on my table and we left. I did look around to see if we could find a manager. I tried to get his attention but he was busy chumming around with some of the wait staff. Poor customer service here  especially for something as easy as dessert. The entire restaurant looks very unclean. And not much can be said about the management. I would give zero stars if I could. I am strongly considering sending a letter to corporate headquarters detailing exactly the lackluster experience I had here. I will never return again.
Cindy W.,El Monte  CA,340,58,101,4/14/2015,5.0,A friend and i came here yesterday night at 11:25pm knowing they would close at 12pm so we asked the host nicely if they would still seat us he was totally nice about it and told us we could grab a seat in the bar area ourselves! (Didnt get a chance to get his name) We decided to sit in a booth table area and menus were brought to us . Valerie told us john will be right with us if she can just grab us drinks first we just asked for water to start and we waiting a while so i guess valerie ended up just being our server she was totally awesome and sweet ! She got all our orderes correct and told us some of the items were happy hour to save us a few bucks which is great! As we continued eatting the manager i believe his name was daniel came around to check on everyone and got us another round of beers even though it was probably a minute past last call ! Love this place would totally come back for the beer and happy hour appitizers! We ordered pitcher of blue moon !Chicken winga   flat bread   and nachos ! We also ordered more but i only have pictures of these items!
Robert P.,Riverside  CA,533,496,373,11/9/2014,3.0,Our lunch bunch decided on BJs because of BJ's purported skill in providing gluten free salads. One of my guests has Celiac disease  and so informed the staff in no uncertain terms. We were 1 fork-full away from a bad outcome. The staff brought the wrong salad to my guest  but in the dim light we could not tell. So she started to mix the salad and gather the right stuff on her fork. She paused when she noticed it didn't have dressing. The next moment the staff brought over her correct salad and... whew. They apologized politely  but this mistake should not have happened. The only reason for this review is to share the story with others who suffer from this disease. Don't assume they (BJs or anyone) does it correctly. Inspect your meal!
Robert A.,Pico Rivera  CA,90,5,1,4/23/2017,1.0,Ordered food online and came in 5 mins after it was suppose to be ready. Still waited another 20 mins to get my food after I got there. Service sucked and I'm never doing pick up here again. BJ's needs to get step up their game or they will lose alot of customers for their horrible service
Karen K.,Alhambra  CA,588,630,607,12/13/2014,2.0,Meh.I got a lunch BBQ Platter. It had chicken breast that was so dry and stiff  and the pulled meat sandwich was small and just okay. It wasn't anything to write home about. They did keep my water full  however  which is a plus.
Medz H.,Montebello  CA,16,35,30,11/8/2015,1.0,"When will restaurants figure out that service is just as important as good food? It seems that most of these places figure that if the food is good then people will comeback no matter how lackluster the service is. What is even more surprising is when bad service seems to be a regular complaint on yelp and its never addressed.The reason for my rant was  my wife and I know that the service at this location is slow but we were hungry after shopping at the mall and gave in. I honestly have to say this most recent trip takes the cake. Not only was the service horrible  but the food made us stand up and leave( I will get to that in a second.)When you walk into a restaurant  you expect to be greeted in a happy  polite manner. In this instance the hostess never said hello nor made eye contact with me. After standing there for a minute or two I finally said ""I need a table for two"" at which point she asked for my name and putt a pager on the counter. 15 min later she yells out my name even tho I have a pager( which was never used).We get guided towards a table by a someone who seems disoriented and couldn\'t decided which route to take. During this this walk she must have asked us at least 3 times how we were doing but kept turning her back to us before we answer  just plain rude if you ask me. We finally get seated and a few mins later a different person came to take our drink and appetizer order  she is friendly! So we give the order and get our drinks...We ordered chips& guac with a side of salsa( not to random) she brings us chips and guac then vanishes. We have no napkins or utensils  and start looking around for help... 15 min goes by and our real server appears ( I have no idea what her name was because she never said it). I explained we needed that stuff and also that we asked for chips  guac and salsa but didn\'t get salsa... ""Oh you ordered two?""she replied. WTF? No  we were just missing the salsa I told her. She leaves a bit confused and then we see he talking to the nice girl that took that order and looking our way. After a few minutes pass the ""nice"" girl comes and brings two little sides of salsa ( you know the cups they put catchup in) what the hell will we do with this? We each ordered a mini pizza and side salad. My wife got a caesar which looked like it had no dressing at all and I got a house with ranch( mine had a dollop of dressing) both were pretty sad even for a side salad. We eat those and wait for another 20-25 mins for our pizzas... They finally show up and both are not fully cooked. When the pepperoni on top of a pizza is still soft and pale colored you know something is off.We called the manager( who was understanding) but who seemed to have this speech down pat! ""Cooks didn\'t make it right and I\'m sorry for the service"".. We offered to pay for the drinks and appetizer but he said no. At this point we left.I would avoid this establishment at all cost and you are probably better off eating in the mall food court next door!"
Iris J.,Whittier  CA,252,268,682,6/16/2016,1.0,"I walked in and it was packed  so the hostess told us it was open seating in the bar. We walked over to the bar and took a seat. We were looking at the menu and I started with water while my friend decided on a cocktail. The waiter then rudely informed us that we could not sit at the bar because I wasn\'t ordering a ""real drink"". At that point he took our menus from our hands and asked us to leave the bar since it was so packed. I was also bothered that a very young couple sat down next to us and he served them alcoholic beverages without asking for valid forms of identification to verify their age before serving them liquor. We got up and went to the hostess to explain what had just happened at the bar with the rude condescending waiter that booted us out of his section. I asked what we should do as far as seating because we still wanted to eat there. The hostess did not try to accommodate us or apologize for that server\'s actions. We asked for a manager and she ignored our request  but perhaps she didn\'t hear me.... I\'ll give her the benefit of the doubt. Either way we ended up walking out and took our business to another restaurant where we were treated with courtesy. We will not be returning to BJ\'s anytime in the near future."
Fernando A.,Monterey Park  CA,9,43,5,9/9/2016,3.0,This place is ok  there pizza and wings are really good  pretty pricey and you could get better pizza elsewhere  the brewery part is legit the beers are good  they have different season beers  but due to the location  its always packed.
Jen N.,Monterey Park  CA,28,181,32,12/16/2015,2.0,How can such a well known restaurant serve such shitty food? How do you do it BJs? My top sirloin was overly dry  brussel sprouts were kind of gross actually and even my clam chowder was subpar. My friend didn't like her chicken. Even though the food was bad I ate ALL of it. Why? Because the server hardly came by so I had so much time to just sit and pick at my food until it was all gone 1hr later. Nonetheless  they have a good beer selection and my server was nice...slow but nice. We got a free pizookie for my friends birthday though. Probably the best tasting thing all night.
Adrian G.,El Monte  CA,30,5,1,12/8/2015,2.0,This is the second time in a row that we come here and the service SUCKS!!!!I guess the secret is to be on the staff because they all appear to be carrying great conversations with one another. The waitress has not been by to check on us since other staff dropped off our food. No refills  no margarita for my wife  and no attention. One would think that they would have brought out the alcohol first and fast so we would continue drinking. No way!!! Not here. It's not like the food is to die for. I can get crappy service at other places that serve ok pizza  mediocre salads and bland appetizers. Unless you're a local or work here don't bother coming they'll ignore you. The bj's in Arcadia is better....way better.
Roni H.,Rosemead  CA,0,16,18,3/27/2016,3.0,I visited BJ's on my birthday 3/22/16 the food was good but you can see the servers were overwhelmed. The restaurant is clean and welcoming.The only problem was having to ask for silverware a few times so we canstart eating. I had my daughter with me and she ordered the kids mac and cheese which was dry and didn't look so appetizing our waiter took it back and brought us a fresh batch. Other than that we will be coming back  they just need more staff.
Adilene M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,4/9/2017,2.0,Came here Thursday to celebrate my daughters bday everything was great food n service but my son n husband got food poisoning. My son ordered the mini hamburgers from the kids menu  he ate one and my husband the other. Next morning stomach pain and running to the restroom. This was our first time here and enjoyed it but with this who kmow if we will be going back.
Maria N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,15,,8/8/2017,3.0,I like coming here for drinks during happy hour. Drinks are good but I am not so fond of the happy hour menu. No margaritas or martinis on happy hour menu. Only limited options for happy hour appetizers. We tried the bjs brewhouse burger with fries and it looked very delicious but my half tasted a bit odd. The bun had some crumbs that made me wonder if they used a special type of bun. My boyfriend noticed it too  but we didnt mention it to our waitress. So I decided to order the seared ahi tuna salad because last time it was excellent. Sadly this time it was disappointing. They added way too much dressing that made it hard for me to enjoy. The tuna was so so. So this time i did mention it to the server that only serving while our original server went on break. She wasnt really polite she just grabbed it off our table and tried to send out another one. As if I my comment annoyed her and she just wanted to rush off. I decided to try the avocado egg rolls and they came out slightly burned and were just terrible. I like avocado but that appetizer was just not enjoyable at all. It was uppsetting to have good drinks but not good food. I wish they would have a wider selection of happy hour food items.
Daniella A.,Los Angeles  CA,14,21,,2/22/2016,4.0,I'm here about once a week and food is pretty good and service is as well ...the only thing is the wait but hey it's probably always packed because this place has a bar and good grub...If you are coming with a big group make sure you tell them you want a big table because they try to squeeze you on little tables!I recommend the house salad and clam chowder soup
lynda l.,El Monte  CA,0,4,1,2/28/2017,5.0,Restaurant was awesome ! Server was nice friendly gentlemen . He was so helpful and suggested what was the deal and good food. Nice server his name was John Luu.
Benjamin B.,Los Angeles  CA,21,7,5,6/29/2016,5.0,Came here to celebrate my brothers birthday. It was an amazing dinner  and the staff were attentive. One of 2 rib eyes came pretty welldone. More than our liking. They replaced it  and took both rib eyes off our bill. IRENE the manager  and Stephanie L. Our server were both amazing at correcting the situation. Because of this  i will happily come back. Kudos to them both! Stephanie L. Made a huge difference with her hustle  charisma  and good vibes! Thanks Steph!
Linda S.,Monterey Park  CA,27,103,117,3/12/2015,2.0,Mediocre food slathered with a lot of butter and oil. This place never fails to make bland and salty foods. I have tried their burgers to their pizzas to their pastas. This is definitely a last-resort restaurant where I would eat at only if my friends can't make up their mind or for convenience. I definitely don't recommend this place if you're looking for good food. I have to give it to them though  for their pazookie that is. You can't mess up cookies and ice cream. Also  their customer service is quite good and the ambiance is laid back and clean.
Jason P.,West Covina  CA,214,261,203,11/9/2014,3.0,2nd visit at this location. Came here on a Saturday night around 9:30. Our group of 5 waited about 30 mins for a table  perfectly understandable. Our waiter was polite  kind  and nice. Only complaint was that service takes way too long. We were able to flag the attention of waiters. We didn't have our silverware and it did not arrive about 5 mins after one of my friends had received his salad appetizer. Our waiter only came to check up on us once (he was really nice though) on how we were doing. Food was delicious. That alone gets 5 stars from me. Started off with the mini bruschetta and finished off with the Brewhouse Black and Bleu burger. Definitely a top 8 burger. This isn't my usual BJs I go to but I experienced the same kind of lagging service even the first time I went here back in 2013. Food is awesome though.

Tad K.,Monterey Park  CA,290,204,1092,8/14/2014,2.0,This is the nearest to the house and wish there were another one closer. Less than impressed tonight.Place was pretty full  for a Wednesday night - got there around 730pm. Seated promptly  but server didn't come check on us for 15 minutes. The lowlights:Food too 25 minutes with cold fries  wrong salads and soup in a sourdough bowl taking another 10 minutes after that. Fish and chips - fish was hot but not much crunch with cold fries - wedge salad came w blue cheese when asked to omit when ordered  and sandwich  although tasty  looked like it was made at home - smooched a bit.Server either over stationed or new  I asked the hostess if this was a training store  and was told it's not. A turned away salad (not prepared as requested - no dressing) was an obvious annoyance to the server who brought it...Overall  not the best this place has done. I'm sure we will be back  but not for a while.
Maria P.,Whittier  CA,24,4,,9/11/2016,1.0,I feel this establishment is discriminating against me for bringing my children we were here first to watch a football game and they wouldn't put it on instead they put us on the other side of the room thank you BJ's...
Ed M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,82,214,2/4/2016,4.0,Nice place to watch a game and spend some time with friends.It's a clean place.The waiting time is something to work on. Sometimes depending on the person with the list it kind of gets lost.But overall I give the 4 stars.Good customer service.Price is fair.
Danielle G.,Monterey Park  CA,1,18,1,7/8/2016,1.0,"I really had much rather given 0 stars. I hate this fuckin BJs and I have no idea why I go back.I\'ve had my share of shitty experiences there and out of the 10 times I\'ve been there  about 6 or 7 times was only for late night happy hour and 0.5 stars only because those nights with friends are what makes it memorable -but still  even then  the service always sucked.I figured hey  lets give the morning shift a shot.(shitty idea)I went in once for lunch  service and food  sucked. Overall experience 3/10. I went again recently with a friend before engagement ring shopping = meaning he was stressed = wanted a beer to mellow out = bjs = good idea. That shit turned out to be the dumbest idea we had. We had sat in the bar area because the there was a wait for the dining area even though it wasnt even crowded and we went a little after they opened.. um whatever  lets sit in the bar. Sat in the bar and encountered a woman who had no smile  I\'m assuming she lost it on her drive to work or something.....? Poor girl. Didnt introduce  no hi  just - sumthin to drink...?...?........................... uh k. We ordered water to start and looked through the menu  she came back again with no emotion whatsoever and totally gave us judgemental stares throughout the entire ordering process. She seemed rushed and impatient because I didnt know what I wanted so I just decided on brussel sprouts and that I would order a meal later on. Each time we asked/said anything to her  she never said any ""I\'ll be back  ok  sure  no problem  thanks  i\'ll be back with that  i\'ll put that order in now"" nada- she would turn her back and dart off. It was insanely weird.Anyway- I decided I had lost my appetite. Didnt finish my appetizer and my friend never even ordered his alcohol because.. god forbid he ordered a beer with her. At the end of the meal  I wanted desert but again.......god..forbid. My friend pointed out that in the table tent thing there was an advertisement for ""use mobile pay thru the app (for the first time) and get a free mini pizookie"" YAY! When the server came by  she brought the check= get out  no desert for you fatasses. My friend ended up flagging down a hostess and mentioned the ad and wanted to order the pizookie- the response from the hostess was ""oh thats expired we no longer honor that.""k  even tho there was no exp date even in the fine print and yet the same advertisement was all over every other table..... cool.we payed our bill  were annoyed as fuck  didnt tip  and left. that waitress didnt even deserve $1 which is saying something.I was insanely bothered still because like I said  i have no idea why I go back  but its closeby  cheap  fast  simple and i knew i would obviously go back but seriously didnt want to encounter that server again. Called the manager  complained  he seemed appalled at everything he was hearing and was sincerely sorry and said ""next time you come in please ask for me so i could make your experience better""so hey  i gave bjs another try today.service in the dining area - server had the same attitude as the other. annoyed. rushed. could give a fuck less about her job.did i bother calling the manager? no. what for? what could possibly have turned around yet another shitty experience? ha. also  the hostess mentioned when we sat down ""free pizookie when you pay with the app!""screw you bjs.also i wont put up the names of the two servers who suck extreme balls cuz i dont want to put them on blast but - i hope they get their heads out of their asses sometime soon."
Josie N.,Long Beach  CA,259,7,1,5/27/2016,5.0,Stephany clark was the BEST!!!! Thanks for the service ...:) great attitude .. Will come back
Priscillla S.,Colorado Springs  CO,0,8,2,1/29/2017,5.0,I love this place. The sodas are always on point. Shout out to Priscilla the Bev. tender/ Host/ Food runner. Frankie was very nice and helpful along with adolfo and Angela. All the servers are super friendly. You will always have a good experience here. I will defiantly come again.
Lynn U.,Pismo Beach  CA,56,110,679,8/5/2014,4.0,Had great service and a tasty dinner last night.. The only thing was when we walked in we waited in the front without being seen for over ten minutes  there was nobody working in sight..meeting? I'm not sure but the food was great and so was the waitstaff! I never felt like I was looking for a refill or anything else. So great job BJ's!
Anna G.,Norwalk  CA,0,6,,2/8/2017,5.0,A group of six of female friends are there today  service was excellent by our waiter Taylor  very professional  funny and pleasant  our experience was really good!
Eva I.,San Gabriel  CA,462,464,3385,3/30/2013,3.0,Scampi pasta& Pizookie. That's pretty much my order everytime I come to BJ's. There's an addicting factor to the saltiness of the scampi pasta. It's quite salty but it's yummy! I love the garlic bread that it comes with too. And what's not to love about ice cream on top of a warm cookie (:This BJ's could be better if the service wasn't so off. Orders are sometimes missed  and food takes a while to come!
Jocelyne Z.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,,7/20/2016,1.0,My boyfriend and I decided to drop in for a quick dinner before we started shopping. We get seated at this horrible table where they said we will be served right away but we were completely ignored by our server. Our appetizer came 20 minutes late so what was the point since our main course came right after? Not to mention my boyfriend ordered a ranch dip and it had hairs on it. Completely disgusted by this we couldn't enjoy our meal and we were ignored. We are never coming back to this place. Horrible food horrible service. Beware and stay away.
Gus C.,Los Angeles  CA,32,119,265,11/12/2015,4.0,Always good service  and the new menu selection is on point  especially the craft brews.
Eileen L.,Monrovia  CA,22,17,,6/13/2016,1.0,I always try to give BJ's a chance  but I'm always disappointed. The service here is HORRIBLE: The beers that they feature/list are never on tap  the last 3 times  it took literally 30 minutes or longer for our food to come out. Despite the horrible service  the food remains good and consistent. This BJ's is lucky it gets customers even with its horrible service; most likely because the surrounding restaurants are crappy.
Veronica S.,Glendora  CA,0,29,1,1/13/2017,1.0,The service here made my mediocre food even less enjoyable. I've never been to this location  and won't ever come back. I waited 20 minutes for a table  which is understandable. Now I've been waiting an extra 45 minutes at my table to get water that I've ordered. The majority of the people here are already served. Which leads me to believe getting my water shouldn't take more than 3 minutes. Also every server here is walking around lollygagging while all 6 people at the front are talking to each other or texting. I think this is the most horribly trained staff I've ever seen. At this point the management should consider training properly or hiring better people  I could dine and dash because Jessica isn't paying attention. This location is giving the company a bad representation of what food service should be. I definitely won't ever come back here  and will need to be persuaded to go to any other location.
Jorge P.,Los Angeles  CA,10,107,57,8/4/2015,4.0,I like coming to this BJ  the calamari usually is very well done and they serve it with a white dressing and marinara. I like to dip each side separately because it gives you more appreciation for the squid. I've gotten pizza the stuffed mushrooms ribs and fries. The fries were a joke tho  I think I was served the bottom of the bag because they were so thin and small they soaked up all the grease. No good. The ribs were good  nothing special but edible and soft meat. The pizza was very very tasty got the supreme taste as it should with good looking breading. The mushrooms are a must try just eat them warm they don't taste the same cold. I'll go back to this one  the one in Glendale is awful from food to service not this one.
Ryan K.,Whittier  CA,4,10,1,3/12/2016,2.0,Food was good service was shit. Our server had a bad attitude almost as if he didn't want to be working here. My advice hire people who are more outgoing and not douchebags ! That's why I go to Brea bjs! Step it up montebello. Beer was good tho
Val R.,Monterey Park  CA,2,17,11,6/10/2016,1.0,I normally love BJ's but not today. We sat in the bar and had the worst service (it wasn't busy at 2:45 on) our waiter seem to not like his job or us  no smile and Bad attitude. He never came to refill our water we had to asked  even though he passed us several times with the water jug. Basically he didn't care about us everything we got we had to ask for! When we asked for our check received it never once did he ask if we wanted anything else like maybe dessert. We spoke with the manager he know the person we're talking about like this had happened before. Come on BJ's I know you can do better with your service!
Jose F.,Houston  TX,523,257,658,2/25/2016,3.0,I mostly stop in for the late happy hour but I have dined here on occasion. My favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls  they are crunchy and salty with that creamy avocado flavor. As far as the entrees they are well portioned. Not the most flavorful  but they do fill you up. Service is okay.
Garen A.,Montebello  CA,477,628,1869,6/28/2013,2.0,I'm sorry  but I was so disappointed with the service I got here during my last visit that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars. The meal started off just fine. The waitress seemed involved  and we were seated relatively fast  and it all went downhill from there. Let's start with the food. We shared a hand-tossed buffalo chicken pizza. The new-ish hand tossed pizza isn't bad  but the deep dish is way (and I mean WAY) better. I wouldn't bother with the hand-tossed. The flavor is ok ... I personally think BJ's puts too much buffalo sauce  but that's just me. I also had a side Caesar salad with chicken. It was pretty bland (I've had much  much better). Now for the service. First the waitress completely didn't understand that I wanted the dinner portion of the caesar salad. There were four of us  we were all sharing the pizza and getting salads as well (cuz two slices of pizza isn't enough for me in my hungry mood) ... we all just ordered the salads we wanted (didn't specify dinner or side) - she brought two of us dinner portion salads and the other two side portions. Who brings two people full salads and the other two side salads - makes no sense to me - and if the waitress was confused why didn't she just ask us to clarify. Anyway  so because she thought we wanted side salads she brought those out way before anything else (leaving us to deal with the awkward waiting until we start eating to be courteous) ... then we waited another 20 minutes for the pizza  and another 20 after that for the other two salads. At one point it had been so long since we'd seen our waitress that we just assumed she'd kidnapped by previous angry customers. The best thing was that she said the delay was due to the fact that they were 'making' more chicken (though apparently they had enough for the pizza and my salad) ... none of this makes any sense. I won't go on ... needless to say I was really disappointed. It wasn't even that full of a night (if your service is horrible on a Wednesday  I don't want to know what Friday night is like).
Barbara L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,2,6/6/2016,1.0,The service today was just bad. What happened to all the awesome waiters??!! Monday night service sucks!! I'll be back tho  but on my usual Sunday night where the staff is awesome!
Laura G.,Montebello  CA,6,4,2,1/8/2017,4.0,a little dirtier then usual that's why i'm not giving it 5 Star. other then that very good food with good sized portions
Monique T.,Montebello  CA,0,1,,1/7/2017,5.0,Great service all the time  especially the pretty hostess Sarah! I have a young toddler and she always accommodates the seating accordingly w our stroller(: Anything off the menu is delicious!
Jesika D.,East Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,0,4,1,2/14/2016,5.0,Jesse W has the best customer service!!! Love this place thank you for making everything great  will be coming more often he has great energy and I'm definitely leaving a tip
Ashley D.,Los Angeles  CA,118,45,139,4/26/2016,3.0,Food was good but our waiter was very slow with food and drinks. I was done with my food by the time he brought my second drink. I wanted a third but he took to long so i said forget it
Bobby L.,Downey  CA,0,4,,1/4/2017,2.0,I got there with a party of 3 at around 10ish on Tuesday night. Upon arriving  the host was not very nice. She welcomed us with a half smile and she looked like she was more than ready to go home. Our server was Nicklus and was very sad to get service from him. He was very dull and was not very welcoming. I saw other servers and was ready to ask them for service instead as they looked very happy and were paying attention to their tables. Nicklus not so much. As a server  he's suppose to pay great attention to his guests  but man he didn't even give us a refill. Sure ill come back  but if I get Nicklus again  ill get back on the waiting list or ill get some sbarro from inside the mall.
Zahra B.,Los Angeles  CA,87,35,32,2/16/2016,5.0,Special thanks to Irene ( shift Maneger). professional services. She came to our table and make sure everything is ok. I just staying in this area for a night for business meeting and our hotel's Host recommend me this Resturant and absolutely right choice :)
Andrea E.,Torrance  Los Angeles  CA,2,9,,11/29/2016,2.0,No wonder why this location only has 3 starts! Ordered a sandwich and the bread had MOLD on it  when it was brought to their attention they gladly took it back but too my whole plate when I wanted the fries it came with! I asked for the bill and that took a while since they had to take off the moldy sand which! Yuck. I got the bill and they didn't discount anything else or even offer a free dessert. Lucky they are getting 2 starts from me but 2 thumbs down
Giovanni R.,Whittier  CA,434,12,1,2/12/2016,5.0,Our server Stephanie went above and beyond her duties always with a smile on her face. Thank you for a great night and service. Leaving the restaurant name on high. Keep it up!
Brian F.,Lakewood  CA,158,270,170,1/24/2015,4.0,BJ's has always been good to my friend and I. We like to come here after work and relax over a beer and some food. I've seen some very mixed reviews here  but suffice it to say I have never been let down. Great service. Busy but fun atmosphere. Tasty good at fair prices. Customer service is top notch. I enjoy the house blond beer. It's crisp and clean. Gives me a nice shopping buzz for when I need to walk off the calories. The food itself has always been great. I always try something different here which is a great indicator for me. The menu offers a lot of lighter fare as well  which is respectable. Great experience from our waitress Jessica. She smiled a lot. Brought me quick beers. Oh and she checked on us frequently. That's a huge positive in my book. I'll be back again for sure.
Julie D.,Pasadena  CA,144,651,47,7/10/2014,4.0,Haven't been to this place in like 4 years. Overall  the service was good but a bit slow on a Friday night  probably due to them being a bit busy. We waited less than 10 minutes to get a table for two.Due to my baby wrecking havoc on my normal eating habits  we shared a pork chop plate (2 pork chops  green beans  cheesy mashed potatoes)  which was pretty solid. I would have preferred a better apple sauce  though. We also shared a personal-sized buffalo pizza  which was kind of salty and a touch dry. Finally  I had a coupon for a pizookie  and we got the salted caramel one since I have tried the others. I didn't find it that great -- it seemed like a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with some drizzles of caramel sauce over the ice cream. It stuck to the plate a lot and wasn't warm and gooey like I had hoped.I like the extensive menu and fun atmosphere  so I'm sure it will be less than 4 years before I return...
Tina G.,Pico Rivera  CA,22,26,11,3/18/2014,4.0,I gave this place 4 stars. Not because of the food but  because of the customer service was awesome! The Tuscany Chicken lemone was way too lemony. Ask for Jessica Y. theServer. Shes a great great server!
Marcos M.,Pico Rivera  CA,1,6,,12/8/2016,3.0,Earlier today I experienced extremely horrible service  and it wasn't the first time either. Not sure why I will come to this BJ's. The moment we got there  we waiting 30 minutes just to order our food. Our server Jessica P. was no where to be found. And when she did come around she was too busy with other tables and flirting with a group of guys. Finally we order and another 30 minutes went by until we received our food which was very good BUT once we were ready for our check  Jessica was once again missing. Finally we asked for it and another 20 minutes goes by until we receive that check. By the time we were completely finished I barely had an hour to shop at the mall. Very very disappointing. My last time going to this BJ's.
Peter L.,Temple City  CA,7,33,12,3/22/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,So this is an update from my previous review.Again  Brian has done it again! He made me feel special and happy with his waiter ways. I don't know what it is about him  it's just so cool to have a waiter making you feel so special. At first I had another waiter  who was positive but not the same type of positive. Then I got Bryan!!! He is the exact same positive I wanted and he makes the food taste more better for some reason. Today I got a BJS Favorite Pizza and it was dreamy. When I saw it  my jaw dropped and mouth watered. I couldn't believe something can look so beautiful... AND DELICIOUS! I ate and loved it! Perfection indeed. Then I got the chicken tacos  which were okay just needed pico de gallo. The whole experience is amazing  thanks to Brian!
Jones T.,San Francisco  CA,61,1329,5,7/12/2015,2.0,Service is great but the food isn't very goodShared with friends   tried the pizza  steak   and pasta.
Stefanie A.,Whittier  CA,282,25,5,2/12/2016,5.0,I love avocado egg rolls but lemme tell you  James made my day. He truly was such a breath of fresh air and so positive. I had a horrible morning and he totally made it better. I wish all the waiters were like him. Thank you James for being one of the most kindest souls
Dub L.,Mesa  AZ,8,77,327,4/2/2014,1.0,Ordered and waited over an hour for our food to come out -- actually  the food only came out because we tracked down our non-existent waiter and got the manager involved. Apparently they lost part of the ticket (everything except for the starter salads)  didn't know how it happened  and attempted to makeit up by not charging us for the food. If only my party could get our Time back and the two kids at the table that night didn't have to cry from waiting/being hungry. :P P.s. the angel hair pasta dish is pathetic - it had 5 pieces of broccoli in the whole dish :P I make better pasta in my kitchen for shits and giggles.
Kevin W.,Whittier  CA,215,2,,5/1/2016,4.0,Great service but the food wasn't that good. I got boneless buffalo wings and they were dry. Jeff was our server and he made us feel very welcome.
Ramy S.,Fontana  CA,8,3,1,4/12/2016,5.0,Ordered on the app. Fast. Convenient. Great service. Food was good and not cold when I ate it. I will most likely use the app to order lunch everytime.
Chris M.,Montebello  CA,21,40,6,1/27/2016,2.0,Oh man. One of the worst visits here. Sat for a while before any one attended to us. Then  Waited over 30 min for a drink.
Monica L.,Los Angeles  CA,2336,1156,1498,11/10/2013,3.0,Come early and expect to wait a while. We came at 6 and the line was already about 30-45 minutes long...I guess there's a lot of early hungry shoppers. The employees were nice and helpful  and the menu selection is extremely vast. I got an ahi tuna salad  and for the most part  it was enjoyable. However  the tiny dabs of wasabi were extremely strong--I know they're dabbed on the sides of the plate  but I didn't see it til I swallowed the first one clinging to a random leaf. I would suggest transforming it into a dressing or doing something else to alleviate the strength of the wasabi--I love wasabi  but this was pretty intense. Also  there were several slices of tuna that tasted overly fishy...to the point where I wanted to gag. I really didn't want to finish the rest of the fish in fear I'd get another bad slice  but I just swallowed and hoped I wouldn't get food poisoning. The bf got a deep dish pizza  and he LOVED it. The toppings were spread all the way to the edges of the crust  and the fluffy dough complimented the rest of the ingredients perfectly.Verdict? It's okay...moreso for the bf than for me. Personally  I wouldn't want to come again because I keep thinking of those nasty slices of fish  but the bf definitely wants to return. Maybe I will try a different salad dish with a fully cooked protein this time.
Ben W.,Montgomery  AL,36,66,100,7/27/2015,3.0,Had the Cesar Salad with grilled chicken. Not bad lots of salad... Not much chicken! Everyone in our party was pleased. Others had burgers  pizza and Ahi Tuna salads ... No complaints! 3 Stars for ok... But average! Service was very good!
Angelina B.,El Monte  CA,3,9,6,3/12/2015,1.0,Here during happy hour and was charged regular price for my beer bummer  our waiter was good but his back up got all pissy once we noticed the overcharge. Sorry for counting my pennies. Will try mot to get beer at this place next time  wait im at a brewery where they specialize in beer
Sherry C.,Whitestone  Queens  NY,101,193,719,2/13/2014,2.0,Came here yesterday and the service was terrible.No water  no utensils  no napkins. 1 star really but I give them 2 for taking the pasta off of our check and I'm just going to assume that I came here on a bad night. Service was so bad that I was not going to tip them... (but I'm a nice girl and left a 10% tip...)Ordered pasta  avocado egg rolls  & chicken and bacon ranch pizza. I really wanted to ask if I should eat my pasta with my fingers but I didn't....I should have! They weren't rude but our waiter was ignoring us for while. I mean if the food was great or at least decent  then I would have just stayed and enjoyed the food.The appetizer was alright but we waited a really long time for the rest of the food. I mean a really LONG time. We even had to grab another waiter for water. Took forever for our napkins and for utensils. The pasta had NO flavor whatsoever.... sigh!..
Sam B.,Bell  CA,2,12,119,7/19/2015,5.0,Great place for that late night cravings avocado rolls  wings  pizza and pazookie is a must. Cajun pasta with shrimp is good plate to share.
Alan M.,Los Angeles  CA,7,130,63,11/26/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Bad experience with waitress ""Jessica P"". 11/25/2014.  The restaurant was typically crowded and nothing out of the ordinary from my past visits. Highlights of our bad experience include:- Lunch for two took one hour even after kind reminders at the 30 minute mark.- A different waitess brought our food. She explained our waitress forgot to submit the order.- No apologies whatsoever from the Jessica. She just returned our change and took off.We were polite and considereate despite the experience.   (I don\'t want to have saliva in my food)After I wrote this review  I scanned recent reviews. Apparently  I\'m not the only one experiencing bad service here.  Adios BJs at Montebello."
Art S.,San Gabriel  CA,0,2,1,9/13/2015,5.0,James and Susana give the best service. All the food is good and drinks are better. I'd like to see a large steak added to the menu. Great vibes here
Edward C.,Los Angeles  CA,78,10,2,7/17/2015,5.0,Awesome place to eat! Great environment and lots of friendly staff! Honestly can't think of a better place than this one hen it comes to delicious food and terrific customer service! The front desk could improve but eh 5*
Dennis G.,Rosemead  CA,16,26,82,3/29/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Wow this is pretty yummy like I said a bit outside my comfort zone but I'm truly enjoying this...
Liz M.,Whittier  CA,2,2,,11/14/2015,1.0,First time at this BJs location and the hostesses were rude. We we're told our seating wait time would be 15 minutes for a party of two. We waited a lot longer than 15 minutes plus people who came in after were being seated before. Don't recommend this location.
Belen B.,Whittier  CA,41,16,9,4/18/2016,5.0,We came for lunch for my son's 16th birthday  party of 8. The food was very good and the service was excellent. A server brought over a little dessert with a candle  I was hoping for the whole loud birthday experience to embarrass him a little but it was still great. We didn't wait long for a table  check out was fast.
Melanie D.,Downey  CA,0,9,1,4/2/2016,1.0,My kids and I like BJs  but the last few times we been here  it's just not good. The restaurant is not busy at around 3pm on a Sat  we didn't have to wait to be seated but the table were dirty and uncomfortable. The server greeted us right away and we were able to place the order. We ordered drinks  app  and a pizza and kids meals  we waited 15 min to just get our drinks  another 25 min to get our app and the food came out a min later. Not a good visit overall.
James J.,Los Angeles  CA,179,10,1,4/16/2016,2.0,Food is amazing  service was mediocre at best to be nice. Server. Was not good at following up on request or giving altertanitives to request. I was not impressed. I was however presently surprised with how good the food was. The Avocado Bacon Burger and the Spizookie trio is too die for.
Marzella G.,Redwood City  CA,1,10,7,4/16/2016,5.0,This review is solely for customer service their food is good but our server Alexis was beyond amazing! She was very helpful and attentive  even joked around with us and made us feel comfortable. The hostess seemed a little bothered when they asked her to seat is which is why Alexis made my night more enjoyable! Ask for her when you go in she will definitely take care of you!
Lionel G.,Monterey Park  CA,576,78,57,5/8/2015,4.0,This place is really nice. The wait is a bit long but to be honest after getting seated and settled I felt like the service was top notch. The servers would connect with you and recommend you food that they think would best fit for your taste. I personally think this place is a good fit for a big group just to socialize and have a good time. It does get crowded on a Friday night but knowing that it is a big restaurant i would say the wait isn't too bad! Lots of parking in the parking lot!
Alma R.,Los Angeles  CA,3,19,32,11/15/2015,5.0,Omg I am so happy that I chose the country chicken it was amazing! !  can't wait to come back again soon!
Lupita G.,Montebello  CA,0,17,15,1/17/2016,5.0,My family and myself absolutely love BJ's. We go there a few times a month always have a great time. We tend to order something different every time we go but we especially love the appetizers. If you ever sit at the bar ask for JAMES he will make you feel at home every time. He is so friendly and loving my family and I love JAMES.
Yen X.,Monterey Park  CA,0,66,,10/14/2016,1.0,It is a Friday night and it's was crowed....I placed an online order 1 hour ahead of time for pick up at 7:30pm. I got there a bit early and waited a few mins before a young lady asked my name and said to go back to get my food. She disappeared and never came back. I waited another few mins and another young lady came and asked for my name  said she will be right back with my food. She also gone and never came back. The line was forming and a gentleman came and asked if I need help. I explained that two ladies went missing in trying to get my food and he apologized. He asked for my name  confirmed my order and went back to get me my food.....This time he came back  told me all my food are in two bags in front to the side. Waiting on the manager to confirmed a coupon. She came and helped me out and asked the male server to make sure all my food are there and he said yes. I already paid  said thank you and went home......Then I proceed to grab my favorite Clam chowder soup  I love this so much I ordered two. I opened the first one and it's was mashed potatoes. I ordered one so no biggie...but there were only two white containers. I thought both were soup. I then opened the other  also white  but not soup. Yes  it's also mashed potatoes. So I ordered 1 mashed potatoes and 2 clam chowder soups and i got 2 mashed potatoes and no soup...no biggie. I tried to call the place first to correct this. I was hung up a few times and was trying to get to someone for a good 35 mins of trying  I went to eat my cold food.....and after that? I am here writing this review. You guys owe me two clam chowder soup  please make some effort to provide them as I did paid for them...Also  if not too much trouble....someone to answer the phone to talk to would be so helpful. Obviously the best thing would have been someone who can pack the order correctly in the first place.
Tiffany L.,Temple City  CA,1007,236,475,12/15/2014,4.0,This place has really great service! Came here for a bridal announcement dubbed the atmosphere and kind waiters made it very memorable fir our dinner
Joe G.,Eastvale  CA,387,528,4944,3/8/2015,4.0,Service was great! Food is always good. Calimari and supreme veggie pizza with a couple of beers. The only downside was it took forever for them to bring out my wife's golden beet and arugala salad. For some reason it took forever. We got our pizza before the salad showed up and that was 20 minutes after we had ordered. Not sure what the deal was. Then when salad was delivered the lettuce was wilted. We usually get better quality food when we eat at BJs but that's at our regular spot. We were driving by and thought to check in and try out. FYI : use the bjs rewards and you could do the call ahead seating. Always works well for us. Happy eating!
Eric O.,Laguna Hills  CA,236,218,52,9/18/2014,1.0,"I had just come back from being out of town  and was craving a pizza from BJ\'s. I happened to be in the area and decided to go here for dinner.I was quoted 10 minutes  but I think I only waited 6 minutes at the most. So far  so good  right?Jessica P. was my server  and visited my table a few minutes after I had been sat. I noticed she had a large party  and several two-top tables  and it appeared she knew one of her tables personally - a lady with a small child in a rainbow tu-tu - as she was spending quite a bit of time at their table.She took my drink order and asked if I was ready to order  but I advised I would get an appetizer  but needed a few moments to look at the menu. Well  I definitely got those few moments - 8 minutes to be exact. That\'s how long I had to wait for my drink. I didn \'t say anything  but kept that in the back of my mind. In fact  during the entire 8 minutes I was waiting for my drink  I didn\'t see Jessica at all.After I got my drink  I noticed BJ\'s had some skillet appetizers - so I ordered their equivalent of Texas Cheese fries - shoestring fries  cheese  jalapenos  pork  and verde sauce  so I placed that as an order stressing I was ordering this as an appetizer  and would order dinner later. Jessica acknowledged this and went to wait on other tables and place my order.A few moments later  I finished my Pepsi  and set the empty glass at the edge of my table - a universal sign I wanted a refill. Remembering how long I had to wait for my initial wait  I made notice of the time  and watched and waited to see how long it would take for a refill.It took 9 minutes for her to bring me a new drink. During this time  I saw her talking with the lady with the child in the rainbow tu-tu  and lean at the server station at the end of the row of tables chatting with several servers. She glanced over occasionally at her tables  but that was it. Finally  after about 7 minutes  she walked by my table  noticed my drink was empty  as were all three drinks at the table next to me  and made the comment to both tables  ""I\'ll be back with drink refills for you"".In the meantime  my appetizer came out  and still being without silverware  I asked someone for silverware  which they brought out to me. A few minutes later  she brought drinks to all of us  and when she dropped my new drink off  she glanced at my empty glass - I watched her make eye contact with it - and then walked away  leaving the empty glass on my table. Gee  thanks. Because my table isn\'t tiny already  you\'re going to leave a dirty empty glass for me to look at. I glanced around at the other tables in Jessica\'s section and noticed EVERY SINGLE ONE of her tables had multiple empty dirty glasses. Apparently Jessica is not a fan of pre-bussing her tables.To her credit  she DID come by a few moments later and asked how my fries were  and I told her they were good  which was the truth. Although the cheese made my stomach feel weird each time I ate a bite  the rest of the fries were actually quite tasty. I had now been in the store for about 40 minutes  and Jessica had still not come back to take my dinner order. By this time  I had finished my second Pepsi  and waited to see if she would offer to bring me a refill. She stopped by about 10 or 11 minutes later  after I had finished my fries (I now had a mostly empty skillet of fries  and two empty glasses of Pepsi on my table) and asked if I was good. She didn\'t ask if I wanted a refill  nor did she ask if I wanted dinner. She just asked  ""Are you doing ok?""At this point  I just wanted to leave  so I asked for my check. While Jessica left to get my check  I stopped another employee and requested to speak with a Manager. A few minutes later  that same employee came back around and told me a Manager would be stopping by shortly.When the Manager came by  he leaned over  and asked how I was doing. I then asked if Jessica was new  and a look of ""I know what\'s coming next"" came over his face. I politely asked him to sit down and told him we needed to talk. He obliged  and I recounted my experience to him: my being out of town  craving BJ\'s pizza  no silverware  the long wait for drinks  no pre-bussing  and most importantly  never being asked what I wanted for dinner. The manager looked upset  not at me  but at the circumstances which I had experienced. He thanked me for letting him know  and told me he would be right back. I saw/heard him talking with Jessica at the server at another server station  and then he brought me a comped check - taking care of everything ($9 worth of food/drink).I really wanted to have dinner here tonight  but after my experience  I just couldn\'t stay another moment. The food was incredible  but there was no excuse for the sub-par service I (and other tables) received. If she was overwhelmed with too many tables  that is on management for having too few servers on hand and/or giving her too big a section."
Lexi C.,South Pasadena  CA,131,85,27,9/16/2014,2.0,"My girlfriend and I decided to come here on a Friday night. We usually don\'t do dinner on weekends and forgot how crazy it can be which is totally understandable. I got there a bit earlier than she did so I checked us in. The main host girl  who was not very friendly or welcoming let me know it was going to be a 20-30 minuet wait and handed me a pager. My girlfriend arrives  we get to chat  next thing you know 30 minutes are well up. Since our pager hadn\'t gone off we decided to check and see what the holdup was... As we walked up we took a quick glance and it was apparent there were quite a few tables open. My friend speaks to another host girl and explains that we have waited over the quote time. She looks confused. Speaks to the original unfriendly host girl who quickly rolls her eyes and said we\'re just gonna have to wait. Second girl says ""well it\'s probably going to be another 25 minuets or so."" SQUEEZE ME? No little missy. That\'s where you are mistaken. We have waited over your quote time and now you\'re telling us to wait longer?? Manager please!Manager heads over to quickly rectify the situation. THANK YOU. Within the minute we are seated... Why??? BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OPEN TABLES! We sat and quickly ordered. I should have started a count as to how many times the hostess walked by and threw dirty looks. If I had a dollar for every time it could have paid for our meals.If we weren\'t that hungry (or already waited that long) after a long day @ work we could\'ve easily gone somewhere else. If your hostesses don\'t know how to quote times properly  trust me you\'re losing business!! Get new girls.Server was good  but unfortunately my food came out about 10 minutes before my girlfriend... Mehhh. I threw in an extra star because it\'s inexpensive  and I like the atmosphere."
Henry C.,San Gabriel  CA,3,21,1,2/16/2016,5.0,Great service. Our server Michael Cano (who worked the night shift on 2/16) made us feel as if we were home. Great manners and a professional gentleman. He made the experience that much enjoyable. Seek for Michael. You won't regret it.
Belinda C.,Pico Rivera  CA,0,6,2,4/12/2016,5.0,My family and I took mom for dinner to celebrate her birthday  super pack and waiting for a table for 23 was a long wait but totally worth it. The manager was super nice and accommodating  they even gave our entire party free dessert. Thank you for making mom's birthday special.
Magaly M.,Whittier  CA,122,43,87,11/13/2015,4.0,Snake bite with some saracha queso dip! Queso was saucy  cheesy  and hot!! Yum. It was 9pm and i didnt want to eat too much but it was still tasty. The server was a bit too dull  kinda like he was ready to go home (he probably was). Over all i enjoy this bjs
J B.,Montebello  CA,0,22,4,6/5/2015,1.0,Temperature in the restaurant must have been about 65 degrees. Our entire dinner party was freezing cold through the whole meal! It made for a very miserable meal. Both men and women's restrooms were closed due to plumbing issues. We had to walk into another store to use the restroom. Food came out late and was not good. Our appetizers came out with the meal!?! Tasted like frozen food just warmed up! I was unbelievable bloated the entire day. Servers were very rude and did not greet customers kindly. We will never be coming back.
George Meredith M.,South El Monte  CA,5,3,,10/18/2015,2.0,Need a new bartender this girl has no people skills took her own tip. It is funny... took a while to notice i was here. Doesn't make feel comfortable i feel like if she's doing me a favor for me to be here.
Yolanda A.,Montebello  CA,0,5,,3/30/2016,3.0,First time here for me. Pizza Cold sent back they reheated it n it was still not hot but pan was turns out a new one was being prepared and different server brought the wrong one out. Daughter order salad order was never placed we were a party of 12 oops anything can happen. Manager handled situation well. Other then that kids were happy with dessert. Lol I guess we'll give them another chance in November.
Jessica X.,Edinburgh  United Kingdom,185,201,282,9/5/2011,3.0,"I came here after a long day of shopping with a friend just to get something warm and delicious in our tummies. The food court was closed  so we resorted to eating at BJ\'s.After being quickly accommodated to a booth near the bar  we ordered the small deep dish pizza: half great white (creamy alfredo sauce with mushrooms and tomatoes all over chicken breast) and half portebello mushroom (flame grilled portebello mushrooms with balsamic vinaigrette dressing all over caramelized onions with balsamic glaze). It all came out to be ~$16 w/tax.The Great White was a bit disappointing because there were no pieces of tomatoes or mushrooms on it.. unless they all magically jumped to the Portebello Mushroom side. It wasn\'t bad  but it wasn\'t the best. The chicken tasted plain. It wasn\'t seasoned at all and I suppose the ingredients in the pizza should have ""seasoned"" the chicken  but you can taste how bland the chicken was.The Portebello Mushroom was alright  but that\'s because mushrooms is one of my favorite toppings on a pizza. It was good  but I feel like with a name like Portebello Mushroom  they should have put a generous amount of mushrooms on the pizza  but when it came  all I saw was a pizza with a couple slices of mushroom here and there drizzled with balsamic glaze over it. They were a bit skimpy on the mushrooms.If you think the small is too small because it only comes with six slices  you are wrong. My friend and I had two slices left over because we were way too full. Don\'t forget it\'s a deep dish  so there\'s plenty of crust all around to fill you up.The service here started off wonderfully  but ended tragically. It\'s like they wanted us to stay and didn\'t want us to leave because when it came down to asking for a to-go box and the bill  they took half an hour! I don\'t usually come here unless it\'s for a banquet or birthday or something  but I don\'t think I will see myself coming here often."
Amy P.,Los Angeles  CA,1344,837,1141,7/12/2013,2.0,On Tuesday  I had made a reservation for yesterday (Thursday) for a party of 12 at 7pm. There is a 20 minute grace period after your reservation before they seat everyone present and give up the rest of the tables. Thankfully I tricked my friends to thinking my reservations were at 6:30 and we would lose our tables by 7pm so we were all here on time =) They almost hated me but .. who could hate the birthday girl?! That's just cruel ..We were seated promptly. The boys went to grab some beer at the bar since there was still 10 minutes left into happy hour. Our waitress was meh. No one else said anything about us bringing beers back to our table but she gave us a hard time - probably because she wanted our bill to add up so she would get more tip. Our food came out in a reasonable time -- 20 minutes or so for the deep dish buffalo ranch pizza. It was just okay.Asked to connect a empty table right by us since we were expecting 2 more people. Our waitress said she would ask and never got back to us. We asked another server and he came back within minutes to help us connect the tables. At the end of dinner my boyfriend told me he told her it was my birthday but she also never brought out the pizookie. Not sure if its because someone in our group ordered their own pizookie seperately? ROOOOOODE. Too bad I don't remmeber her name.
Yuliya T.,Los Angeles  CA,26,150,153,2/9/2015,4.0,I've been here a couple times for dinner  it's alright. It's usually busy but you don't have to wait too long. The food is good. You MUST try the avocado egg rolls.... they're amazing and the sauce compliments them well. The pizzas are decent and filling. I've also had the Thai chicken mango salad. It was good but I wish there was a bit more spice and jicama. The employees are nice and attentive. Good experience!
Uel L.,Fairfield  CA,43,99,202,8/30/2015,2.0,This place is so crowded and loud on a Sunday evening dinner. On top of that  the service was lousy and too long. Waiters and waitresses seem to be over worked. The food was cold by the time we got it. Then they forget to bring those condiments we needed for the food. Bt the time we reviewed the cindiment  we already consumed our food.
Tony A.,Montebello  CA,22,1,,3/25/2016,1.0,Fish plate came 20 min. after the steak. Everyone was done eating when I got my food. Never coming back.
Sergio S.,Los Angeles  CA,5,10,1,4/21/2015,3.0,Great in check in  but very slow when it comes to the dinner. Steak needs to be cut more when it comes to the lean  chef. More snap to your asparagus as well.All in all  it was an ok dinner night.
Josephine C.,Los Angeles  CA,87,405,1683,1/5/2015,3.0,On a Saturday  they open at 10am for breakfast. Who knew! The greeters are nice. We sat in the bar area and the place was dead at 11am. Our waiter  Jonathan wasn't cheery but he was good on refills and took our orders. I ordered mini pizza and salad. It was tasty and delicious. The place is clean and lots of places to sit. By noon time  the place was getting busy. It's handy that is in the mall.
O D.,Monterey Park  CA,0,2,,9/11/2016,1.0,I've been to numerous BJ's in southern California and every time we go to this particular one  I regret going. As soon as you walk in  there's a wet mop odor that hits you instantly. The service has always been slow but when you get seated  order an appetizer and get your appetizer and you still don't have utensils... Really? Then you ask for some and then they don't bring enough for everybody at the table??? The food arrives and we ask the server for more utensils and never comes back with any??? This was on our last visit. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE. PLEASE GO TO ANOTHER BJ's.
Jasmine J.,Artesia  CA,61,3,1,8/27/2016,5.0,Last time I came to this place I said I was never coming back because the wait was so long and to top it off the server forgot about my table and she took forever with refill. Anywho Ieft an event at the sports arena and wanted to get a bite  so I decide to give this place a try again because it was amongst the only few places open. Anyways the wait time for a table still takes forever about 40-45 minutes  I wasn't too happy about it but then my waiter Steven came and took my order promptly and he was so polite. I told him I was starving and I wanted to order right away. I ordered the rib eye streak and he came back with little garlic breads and butter since he said the steak would take a while. He was amazing checked up on me more than once made sure I had everything I wanted. They also had a free promotion for a pazooki  I forgot to tell him about the pazooki and closed out my bill. He kindly told me that in order to get the free pazooki I had to let him know before hand so that he can comp it on my bill. I told him It was fine  yet he went out of his way spoke to his manager and got me my free pazooki. I used to hate this place because the service sucked but Steven made my experience so awesome I'm willing to come back I hope I get him again  he was so polite and prompt with everything.
Rene M.,Pasadena  CA,0,4,,11/15/2015,1.0,BAD BAD BAD service... Waitress was not nice at all!! It took us about 10 minutes to get our utensils after we got the food!!! And food wast horrible!! Never never going back!!!
Mireya O.,Los Angeles  CA,1,5,2,6/6/2015,4.0,To start we had the bazooki 3o and for appetizers we had the stuffed mushrooms and tomato and mozzarella salad. We then had the shrimp scampi  burger and a new dish in the menu  fire roasted barbacoa chicken. The bazooki 3o was very good. Not to sweet except for the macadamia one which was a bit to sweet. The chocolate chip one was very good as well as the 3pl chocolate not to sweet  crunchy edges and soft center toped with ice cream made this dish AMAZING!The stuffed mushrooms: now this dish I absolutely loved a crunchy top soft center and drizzled with pesto sauce the taste was very flavorful. I recommend this dish!!!The salad: we very much enjoyed this this dish. Tomatoes were fresh and the flavor was great!The shrimp scampi: the shrimp were delicious with almost a buttery taste to them and the pasta was soft and delicious too but had too much black pepper. The burger on the other hand was perfection the meat was juicy and a great flavor. The fries with a crunchy thin layer on the outside and soft on the inside had a delicious flavor. The chicken dish: according to our server  this dish was added last week and I can say it was very good! The chicken was soft with a crunchy crust but the best part was the flavor  very juicy!The service: everyone from the front till our server were very nice. But our Server Jeff B. was what put the cherry on top. He was just great and a delight! We did not have to wait for our food neither was our food brought too early. Everything came just as we finished each dish. He was on top of our drinks and had no problems with our orders. THANK YOU JEFF B.!!!
Mo G.,South El Monte  CA,58,127,53,8/29/2015,1.0,I came here for two birthday dinners including my own this week. The service was terrible and our waiter had an unnecessary attitude even though he had our order wrong. Our drinks took a life time and they gave my friend meat in her food even though she requested a vegetarian dish. It absolutely ruined my birthday night.
Food Lover E.,Los Angeles  CA,19,250,196,1/17/2014,2.0,Soggy greasy burger with no lettuce or pickles. Corn fritters were denser than expected  slightly dry and the sauce was not blended well.Loved the thin crispy fries though.Pizookie was...a pizookie.Service was good.Their sauces suck though. Salsa tasted like marinara.Creamy avocado sauce tastes like watered down  left over guacamole.Buffalo sauce: good (but also seems like it's bottled).Expansive lunch menu though and prompt seating.
Maggie C.,Los Angeles  CA,3674,2688,11470,12/27/2012,2.0,My co-worker & I planned to go to Marie Callender's at first but we had to wait 10 minutes even though there were a lot of empty tables. Lunch time is very precious..some of us can't afford to wait. BJ's to the rescue..We were seated right away @ BJ's and the place was packed.Ordered southern fried chicken. My friend ordered bruschetta and fish & chipsThe food was okay but it was cheap and fast.2 stars!!BJ's restaurant is almost yummylicious!!
Sandra J.,Whittier  CA,0,5,,2/10/2016,2.0,Had dinner 2/10/2016 and was not impressed. Service was fast but our server had no intention of helping modifying a plate since the chicken parmesana with spaghetti was no longer on the menu. I had the shrimp with asparagus over penne pasta and honestly there was nothing about this dish that would make me want to go back. It tasted like a recepie you can find on pinterest. The whole point of going to a restaurant is to leave wanting more of what you ordered right? Even the Arnold Palmer drinks were not evenly half and half. The only good thing about our visit was the avacado rolls appetizer. You can't never go wrong with these. They are delicious! Overall blahhh....
Slim L.,Monterey Park  CA,1,15,3,1/26/2016,5.0,Love the atmosphere and the food. Met up with a friend and enjoyed their mini deep dishes and brussel sprouts. Everybody loves pizza  but i didn't know brussels sprouts were so good. Will definitely come back for more food and drinks!
Marco F.,Beverly Hills  CA,0,3,,2/25/2016,4.0,Great food but most importantly I loved the mojeto Ask for Sandra she is the best waitress ever we lover her every time we come here
Lola P.,Panorama City  Los Angeles  CA,0,41,1,8/29/2014,4.0,BJ's is always consistent with good food and drinks  especially their pizza  baked potatoes  and pizookies. It's like higher end family dining.My favorite is their happy hour! My husband and I each have a drink and are stuffed on appetizers for usually around $25. Our favorites are their cosmos  daiquiris  beer  mini pan pizza  avocado egg rolls  and spinach dip  If you have room  the Oreo pizookie is delish.The service is always great! You have to sit in the bar for Happy Hour and usually most places don't have the best service there  but BJ's is the exception. Our servers are always fun  friendly  helpful  and present.
Jeremy B.,Anaheim  CA,193,13,2,1/22/2016,5.0,It's refreshing to have a superstar server! I am a food and beverage manager for Embassy suites hotel and it truly is hard to find a customer service driven waitress! Jessica was fantastic  engaging  friendly and extremely hard working! She is a shining star in your restaurant and the sole reason for the five star rating! Thank you for your outstanding service Jessica  my family is very grateful!
Monique E.,Fontana  CA,0,13,9,2/6/2016,1.0,The service at this bjs is a joke this is the second time I have checked in via their app and been totally disregarded. I check in head there to be told I have to wait the standard waiting time what's the point in checking in online then? What's the point in supposed preferred waiting list? So the hostess tells me come back in forty minutes so I come back in thirty just in case and boom of course they gave my table away and then they say I'm sorry you will get the next table all lies. They put me back on the freaking waiting list and was told by the other hostess it would be thirty more minutes dude I'm done
Veronica E.,Whittier  CA,207,85,83,9/6/2014,4.0,BJ's is always fun. Have great food and a great selection of drinks. They have their own beers they are great ! Not to much a beer drinker so it takes a lot to say that. Piezookie is always so yummy ! Make sure to get there early on game days or else it's a full house.
A S.,Pico Rivera  CA,0,12,,2/2/2016,5.0,I am here now. I have a food allergy to pepper. I wanted an appetizer of guacmole and chips. Problem is it has pepper. Our waiter checked with the chef and it was made without pepper.Most big restaurants don't make anything themselves. Everything is premixed and served as isOur waiter Efrain made our day.Food was good and so where the drinks
Brian B.,Anaheim Hills  CA,422,692,43,6/30/2014,2.0,I have had so much better. Service sucked  all the servers need to go to etiquette school. Sitting in the bar with an aisle on either side and every time the server out runner came by they would reach across someone. Ron was taking a bite when they shoved my food in his face. When refilling drinks same thing  when they bothered to come refill  even after being asked for a refill  they reached across people rather than go around the table to the other side. The food  I got the roast beef dip. It was small  much smaller than and less delicious than say Philippes.
Chris A.,San Jose  CA,5000,745,1895,4/8/2013,4.0,Great place and wonderful service at the bar. This is only place that open late in the area after 11pm on Sat night lol. After wedding and we were looking for a place to drink and driving around and can't find any place that open after 11pm on Saturday night so we ending up here.  There was a lot of table to be seated but we all seat down at the bar so that we can get our order quick. We all order up some drink and food and I had a wonderful time here.
Jesus R.,La Puente  CA,71,23,14,8/14/2014,1.0,Horrible wait. We waited for over an hour at out table and when the food came it was long from good. Wings were the size of nickels and dimes. Won't come here again. Horrible service...
Nate M.,San Ysidro  CA,30,100,4,7/4/2016,2.0,The service is as bad as advertised. They simply do not have enough employees working during prime hours. We came in as a party of 12 and there was extra charges for things not received. We came in for my birthday and chose this one due to location. The city of Industry BJ's has better service hands down.
Joanne ..,Los Angeles  CA,289,31,13,7/16/2014,2.0,I've been to a few BJ's and this one by far wasn't really impressive. Sat at the bar and ordered a BJ's special. The pizza was okay  but the dirty plates we kept getting was not. We asked for new plate when there was still food stuck on the ones we had. The second one just looked like someone's old plate with grease all over it. The only plus was one if the waiter  an older gentleman was checking in time to time with a big smile. He was always making sure we had enough drinks. It's a great place if you want to just hang out for a beer or two but I wouldn't go here for a meal.
Laura C.,Norwalk  CA,30,254,271,11/24/2015,2.0,Came in with colleagues to celebrate a birthday. I usually order the bison burger although I've never had it here. It seemed really dry while I believe its been moist along with some BBQ sauce. I do enjoy their beer selection and happy hour. Service was eh  okay.
Cin M.,Montebello  CA,13,38,18,11/21/2014,5.0,Food is great and service has always been good here. I usually get the Cajun shrimp pasta. And avocado rolls.
Ariel F.,Los Angeles  CA,113,1,,7/18/2014,1.0,I came in a few weeks ago and it was the worst experience ever ! I usually come here and I've had no problems  but that day was one of the worsts ! It was about 12:30 when we went in. The waiter comes to out table to get our drinks  we tell him that we are also ready to order  he takes our order and leaves. 10 minutes pass and they bring us our drinks  he tells us that the good would be out shortly. 15 minutes pass and he brings out our appetizer  and says that the would be coming out in a minute. We said no problem and wait  and wait  and wait  and wait  we waited over and hour !!! Everyone who came after us were already finished eating And we still didn't have any food !! It was already 1:45 and we still had nothing. I tell the waiter that I wanted my check and I just want to pay the drinks. He left to get the check and never came back! 25 minutes later  he's comes with the check and says that we should still keep on waiting  I'm sorry but I don't have time to be waiting ! He claims that the food was already being cooked and he couldn't do anything about it. We just paid our drinks and left. I was here for almost 3 hours and didn't even get food ! This is unacceptable !! I don't know if I'll ever come back !
Mark K.,Rosemead  CA,12,111,180,7/10/2014,2.0,"Came here for lunch with my girlfriend  and the last time we were here was a few months after they had opened. First off the food is just okay  nothing amazing just the same old menu.Second the service was okay at first but got worse as the meal went on. About only 5 minutes of getting our food the waitress comes by to tell us she is leaving (normally thats fine). Then she continues to tell us that if we want desert it has to be ordered in 5 mins before she leaves  right away this was a red flag for desert because we don\'t like to be rushed. After our silent pause she then continued to say the check is ready and that if we want desert we have to tell her in 5 mins  then another pause and she says ""or"" I can give you to another waitress. At this point the beginning of our main meal was ruined and we no longer wanted to order desert.Won\'t be coming back anytime soon  you\'d think for being open for so long that the service would be better."
Roman R.,Azusa  CA,156,6,,1/14/2017,1.0,"This BJ\'s is by far the worst place I\'ve ever been to. Usually I don\'t write reviews  but this place was so horrible  I had to share with everyone. First off  my girlfriend and I waited 20 minutes(not bad)  but when we got seated  it took us 30 minutes to get our ONLY glass of water and ironically it took us 20 minutes to get our food. But  meanwhile  while we are waiting  there\'s about 8 hostess up front doing absolutely nothing  one girl was walking around in her phone constantly  and the servers were so lackadaisical. Our server never asked if we needed refills  never asked how the food was  and never had a smile on her face. On top of that  when we were done and ready to pay  we had to wait another 20 minutes. Definitely didn\'t wanna be there for an additional 20-30 minutes just waiting for our check to be ticketed out. But luckily the ""Manager"" was able to ticket our check. Whoever hired the employees definitely needs a reevaluation on his/her management and hiring skills. The service was so bad it made mediocre food taste horrible and unappealing. If I could give a 0 star I most definitely would."
Marc M.,Bedford  NH,10,19,2,8/10/2015,1.0,Brought my mom  five year old daughter and nine year old son to BJ's here in the Montebello mall. The first thing I did was to order the kids food  so that they wouldn't have to wait long for their food. After 35mins. with no food arriving  I asked if they could just pack our meals to go. It's now been over 45mins.  our food just arrived (in to go containers) but we're Still having to wait for the bill to be delivered so that we can leave. Will not be back anytime soon.
Jennifer N.,Ewa Beach  HI,79,41,120,7/7/2015,3.0,Advice to all cooks out there. Get your temps right. Especially with the rares and med rares. We who like bloody meat want it bloody. Its not just BJs but most place I go can't give me the bloody meat I want. I am not being a snob  I started as a cook and am now a kitchen manager/chef. I went to culinary school but you Dont need schooling to cook food to the right doneness. Please help the carnivores! The bartender Laura (?) was very attentive and that's why I added a star.
Greg B.,Whittier  CA,58,5,,10/1/2015,1.0,Service was shit. Five employees couldn't even ask us for our order. Straight garbage
Nathan M.,La Puente  CA,0,3,,7/14/2016,1.0,So I never leave reviews but I felt like this time I had to  first of all they messed up on an order and the right one came out with plastic in it  second my brothers dish came out super late and to top it off it was my birthday and I had a terrible time  my pazookie and check came so late that I couldn't even stay to eat it
Shiloh F.,Whittier  CA,616,112,1614,11/3/2014,4.0,What really makes this spot for me is the staff and the beer! The food is whatever  but I come due to how welcoming the vibe is. Always a great time here. My buddy and I get a beer thats half Tatonka and half Jeremiah red and call it Red Bison. Give it a try ;)
Kelly V.,Pico Rivera  CA,108,48,9,4/25/2014,2.0,So done with this BJ's. Service is so slowwwww and waiters don't care that you're upset because you've been waiting. I gave it a second chance after the first time we came. Service sucked just as bad the first time. Most definitely will not be coming back. One extra star for the food being okay.
Darren L.,Montebello  CA,105,63,9,11/15/2014,3.0,Went there for their seasonal beer which was a Belgium Limited Edition abv 10%  ibu 11. It was so tasty I ordered the two house limit due to the alcohol content. Ordered the fried artichokes which turned out to be very good  then for my dinner  had the Beef Dip. Love the horseradish mixed and the beef dipping sauce and dipped my fries in the horse radish dip. It was very good.Waitress was very attentive to all of our needs. A great outing.
Amanda C.,Whittier  CA,118,4,1,5/1/2015,1.0,"Worst service I\'ve ever received at BJs restaurant beginning with the Host. Right when my boyfriend and I walked in he didn\'t acknowledge us and turned his back! Mind you it was a Friday night at 11pm and no one was around. I actually had to greet him! When we were finally seated we ended up waiting 15 -20min before we got up and left. NOT ONE PERSON greeted us or asked if we wanted to water. Before we left I informed the host that no one had acknowledged us and if he could get me the manager. You would think he would have said  ""I apologize! What can I do to for you let me get someone to you right away"" but all he said was ""Oh he\'s over there his name is Earl"". If anyone ever asks or is telling me they are going to Bjs I\'ll definitely do them a HUGE favor and tell them to go to Puente Hills or West Co. A little further but worth it instead of getting shitty service. All I wanted was a pizza:("
Nikki S.,Alhambra  CA,90,4,,3/3/2016,1.0,Take out service sucks. Called at 9am  they told me to call back at 10:50. Called at 10:50 and was told my order will be ready in 30 minutes. Got to the restaurant and nobody greeted me. Hostesses are no good  just told me to wait until the take out girl gets there. Finally about 20 minutes later I paid for my order. I didn't get my food until 12:07 when I was suppose to have the food for important meeting back at work. When I finally got back to work I realized the sides and soup were missing. I hate to be a bitch about stuff like this since I understand it's the peak of lunch hour but this order was for a lunch meeting at work and for someone to not eat during a lunch meeting it just made me look really bad. I would've gone back to pick up what was missing but I was already late to my lunch meeting. There was only one girl dealing with take out. Disappointed in this place and probably won't be coming back.
Julia G.,El Monte  CA,2,3,2,1/20/2014,3.0,Today was my first time trying BJs & it was an alright experience. Many of my friends say its really good and all but it wasn't all that. My waitress was nice for the most part  but when I'd ask if she can add something to my tab she would give me a funny looking face that I did not appreciate.Their menu is filled with many selections  which is good. Their strawberry lemonade was very refreshing!The appetizer  along with my family's plates look really nice & presentable; but my plate (the parmesan chicken) wasn't put very well together. It looked sloppy & was kind of cold. For a first timer  the experience was ok.
Francine L.,Los Angeles  CA,1563,1637,3096,6/25/2012,3.0,Montebello Town Center is an interesting place and this BJ's is quite popular with a lot of people. I've only sat here for dinner and thought it was pretty nice. Always got to sit way in the back and not that many people eat that late at night.Had a few drinks here and yes they are pretty strong  well for me I'm not to sure about all the other alchy's. The place is comfortable and you can order a lot of different types of food from pizza  seafood and steak. I would say it is a variety of options that makes me like this place and also just having fast and quick service is always good. For a chain it's pretty alright and I would say if you want to grab a few drinks with a few friends you can do that sitting down on the tables or they do have a very large size bar area for people to meet some new friends!
Adell L.,Monterey Park  CA,2,46,,9/23/2016,3.0,"My family and I had a birthday dinner at BJs (9/21/16). The young man serving us was nice and helpful  he just seemed alittle nervous. Maybe he was new. But not an issue. My issue was the meal I ordered. I asked for the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon. I\'ve had this a couple of times before & it was awesome. But when I took my first bite  All I tasted was SALT! It kinda left a slight discomfort on my tongue. I gave a bite to a couple of family members with me to make sure it wasn\'t just me. They all said the same  very salty. The server asked me if I wanted s different meal as a replacement but I said no  I\'d like a less salty salmon dish. He obliged & took my plate. After everyone was done eating my replacement meal came. So much better. But since everyone was done I took it to go. It was maybe 15 min. wait. The server apologized & told me to ask for ""low sodium"" next time.  A major chain like BJs should serve each dish the same way every time. You expect to get what you\'ve had before  the same flavor. It was funny because at the BJ\'s in Covina a few weeks prior  the same thing happened. I order the same dish & it was over salty. I didn\'t complain at that time but I should of. Like I said you expect to get the same dish flavor every time. Let\'s hope the next time is better."
Brianna H.,Victorville  CA,0,3,,6/9/2015,1.0,The food was good! We ordered at 4:25  and we got our food by 5:35. The wait time to eat was horrible! We kept seeing waiters come out with our food  asking multiple tables if they had what we ordered. And every time they said no  they kept going back to the kitchen with our food. Then finally  our food comes out with a server  and she tells us not to touch the cast iron pot that our pizzas came in because they were burning hot. She wasn't our waitress. So  I touch the pot to see if it's hot and it's cold. . So our regular waitress comes and asks how everything is and we tell her ok  or food was wondering for over 30 minutes. And that the skillets our pizzas came in are warmish not even close to being hot. And she says oh there not supposed to be hot. But yet the lady who brought them out said we would get burned. So  don't go here if you expect good service.
Juan Z.,Huntington Park  CA,70,67,10,10/26/2015,4.0,This is the third BJ restaurant that I have visited and it was the bit disappoing service that I had. My usual dish is the baby back ribs with the side of steamed broccoli and wedge cut fires. The food was great but it was disappointing that it did not include the bbq dip for the ribs and the ketchup for my fries. I think the waiter might be new but I give kudos for the effort.
Laura O.,Whittier  CA,54,283,134,9/1/2014,5.0,Whether you are celebrating a birthday  anniversary  special occasion  or just a simple chosen dinner location  this BJ's does not disappoint! The staff is nice and the food is delicious! I think because of the location though it gets crowded and full very fast so expect to wait outside for awhile but it is worth the wait to dig into their specialty pizzas and beer! :)
Coco P.,Monterey Park  CA,1,31,15,8/15/2015,2.0,The staff was nice and the food was good but I literally have to cancel my plans for the day because it took sooooooooooo long to get served and to get our check. They need way more people on staff
Brittany J.,Whittier  CA,54,19,8,3/19/2015,3.0,"I come to BJ\'s on a regular basis the food is always good and the service is above par. Today was an exception. The waiter didn\'t write down the order (very simple classic burger no cheese no mayo) a few min later he comes back to ask if I want tomatoes.......uhhhhh if he had written it down he wouldn\'t have to ask. My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was very good and why the rating isn\'t lower  but when my very simple classic burger comes out its covered with cheese and mayo. The waiter then tries to plead his case by saying I told him ""no bacon"" which doesn\'t even come on the classic burger. So bottom line I was very disappointed in what is normally a above average restaurant"
Della N.,Whittier  CA,21,3,4,7/4/2015,1.0,"I was looking forward to a nice dinner on a Friday night. All I got was a plate piled high with disappointment. Table for two.25 minute wait. But it was really only 10mins maybe less.We are escorted through the dining room floor and it was just too crowded. It was like being at a concert. After bobbing and weaving to our tiny table  we get our menus and sit patiently for almost 20mins before our waitress comes by. Drinks ordered. Water and a lemonade. 10 more mins until she comes back to take our food order.I ordered the same thing I had ordered the last time I was at BJ\'s. Fish and chips. She asks me ""wedges or crispy string fries?""I said  ""Crispy fries."" She confirms by repeating \'Crispy fries\' and takes note.Food runner comes out and gives me fish with a pile of wedge cut fries. .......really? I hate complaining but I was disappointed. I had some encouragement to flag the waitress and let her know she had ordered the wrong fries. I tell her. I don\'t remember her saying sorry  but I remember her saying  ""keep those fries and I will bring you a plate of string fries.""Another food runner comes with a plate of fries. The fries were burned. I\'ll never go back to this BJ\'s. Probably never go back another BJ\'s again."
Nicolette S.,Long Beach  CA,0,7,,12/13/2016,1.0,I came here to watch the mnf game with a friend. We wanted the nachos and the menu didn't list any meat ingredients  just black beans and veggies. We checked with the waitress just in case because I'm a vegetarian and she also said there's no meat! Nachos arrive  i grab one  and while chewing it realized there was meat on them!!!!! Vegetarian of SEVEN YEARS over here and i ate meat because of this place!!! This was yesterday and im still sick 12 hrs later because of it. And on top of that  the nachos were prepared terribly. They gave us another order without meat and only about 5 nachos actually has cheese on them. There was no lettuce  salsa  or avocado on them and the menu listed all of them. Instead they were covered in olives which were not listed on the menu and both of us hate olives. These people clearly don't follow the menu so make sure you quadruple check if you have allergies or diet restrictions.
Alan K.,Monterey Park  CA,455,640,10,10/3/2012,4.0,3.5 Stars  if you will. I like this establishment  I have a few problems with this place sometimes; but at the same time they try to remedy it. I feel so confused about this place because my overall experience here can't be described as consistent.FOOD QUALITY:Do I like their food? Well.. yes. I think they're above-average quality in their pizzas and most of their dishes. Clam Chowder is always a delight to eat. Pizzas are pretty large (but not the best tasting). Sandwiches I feel could shine more if they tried; they taste and feel like average sandwiches. Open-faced burgers are HUUUUGE and flavorful; their pastas are unique but I feel are overpriced. Jambalaya is super oily for sure (thank you andouille sausage.) To this day I still don't know how or why their baked potatoes are monstrous-sized. To this day I still think PIZOOKIES are the best thing to eat here. SERVICE:Hit or miss! I do notice that a lot of times my waiter/waitress disappears for some time to the point where I feel like once I have his attention I have to get everything I want done in one go or else I will never see my waiter again.ENVIRONMENT: It's pretty spacious in here. Dark. Loud & noisy. Seating is generally comfortable but I disagree with a few of the table arrangements because I dislike having to look forward only to see a family eating in booth seat. It's very convenient to have a BJs at the mall  so I'm glad that it's just around the corner to deliver some quality dishes.
Sally Z.,Rosemead  CA,123,30,67,8/8/2015,2.0,I'm not a big fan of BJ's but today was the worst service I've had. Been here many times and service has never been this terrible. We were seated and not once asked if we wanted to start with a drink. We waited 20 mins and had to get up to ask for assistance. Finally Michael came to wait on us. He is very nice and accommodating. He didn't know we were seated which shows how poor their communication is with each other today. I had to vent since I came here starving!
Andrew  P.,Bell  CA,24,19,15,9/10/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,"So 8 months ago was the last time I actually reviewed this place and again I got lucky and got Chris as my waiter. He still remembered who I was and asked him how the job had changed since the last all he had to say is ""this is a job I love to do because I interact with different people and having them satisfied with their orders and drinks makes me happy because the rewards are great"". His positive attitude after 8 months does impress me because the consistency of his customer service has not changed since I first bumped into him. In this field consistency is key to great service. On top of that Bjs has a better menu to start off they have new wings which look bomb and they also started the OKTOBR FEST tradition with the new beer on tap. Can\'t wait till the weekend for the events but for now the vibes and customer service here at Bjs will do along with my Jeremiah red and the first game of the season! LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!!"
Valeria A.,Pico Rivera  CA,25,120,12,5/2/2015,1.0,I called to ask a simple question & I didn't hear the girl very clear over the phone so I asked again & she just said no. Then she hung up on me before I can ask my second question. It's very clear that they don't want my service so I'll make a drive further out to another BJs.
Tony M.,La Puente  CA,268,109,183,7/10/2014,4.0,Totally cool and casual  can get really busy  not as big as the normal BJs I've encountered  but still a cool spot for some beers and tasty treats.
S C.,Los Angeles  CA,12,38,3,4/12/2015,1.0,Tried calling ahead for a take out order at 7:55pm. Got put on hold for over 5 minutes then got hung up on. Strike 1. I was already driving there so I said screw it  I'll just order there. I placed my order at 8:24pm. The guy said your order should be ready in 20 minutes. I went back to my car  waited 19 minutes then walked back in. No one came to the register until 9:00 was told that my order wasn't ready quite yet. So I sat inside and waited  and waited and waited. Food came out at 9:14pm. Strike 2. Got to the car  the pizza I ordered was cold and the salad was warm. Strike 3. It was Saturday night but it was not that busy. Terrible service.
Tevi S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,4,10/22/2015,2.0,"The only reason I give this place an extra star than I would it\'s because of their chicken alfredo  But if it weren\'t for that I would give this place no stars if I could. I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and the waitress or whatever came to us with an unnecessary attitude well  towards me (I did nothing wrong). She was being more polite to my boyfriend but that didn\'t bother me because we ignored her once. She said ""Do you need a box?"" at the end to him and when she was already leaving she turned around and said ""or anybody??"" Point here is  because of her she ruined our night  we didn\'t want to leave any tip but because I\'m not such a bitter person I left 3 dollars so she can fix that attitude up. Oh and food took a long time on top of that. Won\'t come back!"
Stephen K.,Alexandria  VA,180,376,234,1/22/2013,5.0,Love their happy hour food specials. I have not eaten at BJ's much and enjoyed getting to try so many of their different pizzas and other appetizers. Went with a group of friends and shared quite a few appetizers. The lettuce wraps are great as well!Oh  and try their house Root Beer. Comes in a frosted mug and is better than A&W.
Ara K.,Middletown  NJ,7,47,34,7/6/2015,2.0,Came here tonight with my wife and son. We hadn't been here in a few years  but I quickly realized that we weren't missing much. We ordered the iced tea and a flight of beers which was very good. For an appetizer  we ordered the avocado rolls  which were barely cooked on some edges and then some edges overcooked. I ordered the BBQ pizza and my wife had the honey chicken salad. All it was was a fried chicken patty on top of a pulverized bed of lettuce  hard boiled eggs (that were the size of tic-tac)  and corn.The waitress brought us the check without asking about dessert. When I see this  I like to drag things out for the waitress  because I know she is dying to leave and go home. What bothers me is that there were still four tables other than us  in her section. If we were the last table  we would have just left without dessert. But we legitimately wanted dessert and ordered some. So  the waitress took the check back and reprinted the check with the dessert added on  but still  no dessert was served yet. Dessert was damn good.....just eat the Pizookies ASAP because they harden and become inedible.It's ok.
Robert A.,Whittier  CA,50,145,40,3/4/2014,4.0,"Been coming to this location for quite some time now and figure it\'s time to apply some stars to BJ\'s profile.Food is actually really good  as long as you stick to what they do well. In this case the shining stars of the menu are the pizza (both deep dish and hand tossed)  the chicken wings  and their burgers. Unlike a traditional Chicago deep dish  the BJ\'s deep dish takes a more California take on the recipe  meaning it\'s more doughy  yet still crispy on the outside. The burgers here are also surprisingly good  especially the newer ""Brewhouse"" varieties. Everything else here is about average  except the pastas. For some reason  I\'ve rarely heard good things about their different pastas. So it\'s best to steer clear.Service is always good  but can feel a little stressed during busy periods. This location gets VERY busy during weekday lunch  so either arrive early or be ready for a short wait if you come for a weekday lunch. Otherwise  shoot for a late lunch/early dinner if you are looking for more personal service and a less packed dining room.Speaking of lunch  they do have some very good lunch specials that are plentiful and won\'t put a huge dent in your wallet. So that\'s a huge plus."
Stephanie M.,Los Angeles  CA,8,23,40,6/8/2014,4.0,Really like coming here on Thursdays night between 10pm-midnight. Happy is great. Prices are good service here is friendly. I think I've interacted with most of the servers and they're kind and efficient. Happy hour menu is good food. Can't complain this is my Thursday night happy hour spot.Don't come here aside from happy hour. Beer is great.
Virginia Y.,Northville  MI,176,253,608,8/8/2012,1.0,"Walked in and was greeted awkwardly  the hostesses looked like they were new and not sure what they were doing. When she introduced us to who was going to take us to our table she seemed nervous because her sentences came out unsure. A new guy who was ""training"" seated us (you can tell he was really nervous but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. We came here for lunch today because I saw an ad in the newspaper for Party for Two deal for $19.95. You get a choice of 2 salads or soup  a medium pizza  and a pazookie to share. The pizza we ordered (combo) was bleh  it didn\'t seem fresh  tasted like it was sitting out for a bit before they brought it to us. My bf ordered a turkey cobb sandwich and received a turkey club. He ate it anyways because he didn\'t want to have to wait for them to bring out the correct order. (waitress seemed like she was in a rush when introducing and taking our order)I wanted to sign up for the BJ\'s premiere card and asked the waitress if I could sign up  she said ""yeah"" and walked away. I was confused  yeah I can sign up or yeah I\'ll go grab you a form? So I went online to sign up because I wasn\'t sure if she was coming back or not. She came back with the form and said to fill it out and let her know when I\'m done so she can scan it. I was expecting her to explain the program to me but she just dropped it off and walked away. It seemed as if our waitress didn\'t care to be there or maybe she just didn\'t want to wait on us. Her answers were short and she always ran off before we could ask her anything. We ordered our pazookie and boxes for our leftovers and waited for the waitress to clear our table  she dropped off the pazookie and boxes and didn\'t come back until we asked for the check. There was no room to eat our dessert  I had to start stacking the dishes so we could make some room at the center of the table to eat it. The cookie for the pazookie seemed really thin  you could barely taste the cookie. I haven\'t had it in awhile not sure if they changed it or if its only at this location. Overall I would NOT come back to this location. Probably the worst service and quality of food!!! I normally like you BJ\'s but you sure let me down this time."
Vanessa M.,Cypress  CA,6,3,1,9/22/2015,1.0,So first of all  we ask..are there any booths available and got a nasty response from the hostess! Not cool. We knew from there that this wasn't going to be a pleasant dinner. Then  it took forever to get our drinks and order our food. Once our food came  we asked for ranch from TWO different waiters and there went by another half hour waiting. We will definitely not be coming back to this location. Disappointed.
Alex C.,Los Angeles  CA,114,156,61,11/18/2011,2.0,"First of all  God knows why the people who founded this place named it BJ\'s. This place has been the butt of all sophomoric jokes ever since I can remember. WHERE are you going to eat? [snickers]I came here for a company lunch. The good thing is they can handle a large group of people. We had 12 in our group. I\'m just going to get right to it. All the food was salty. And I mean salty as in ""I need to drink a gallon of water after I eat"" salty. Is today National Cherish Sodium Day? I could not taste my food at all. It\'s no wonder Americans are getting so damn fat! I feel my heart racing as I\'m writing this review. Our server was a trooper though. She was great at trying to keep our drinks refilled.- First star for the Pumpkin Ale. Yes  I drank at lunch. That\'s how I roll.- Second star for the Pazookie dessert. Thanks BJs for ruining an otherwise great name! Boooooo....."
Kelvin C.,Brea  CA,159,1067,998,2/13/2012,4.0,Probably one of the only places in the area where you can grab a drinks and good food all in one package. They also just upgraded their taps so you can find items like Pranqster  Green Flash IPA  Racer 5 IPA  Sierra Nevada Celebration  as well as several others including their own brewskies. I do love their happy hour : $2 off apps  $5 mini pizzas  $1 off beer). Their appetizers are consistently good as I recommend the Tuna Poke  Wings  Sausage thin-crust pizza  Sliders  and the Pulled pork sliders. I'd definitely recommend that you sit at the bar/counter as that is probably where you'll get the best service...sitting elsewhere could net you some pretty spotty service.4 stars.
Elaine L.,Los Angeles  CA,2,44,8,5/27/2015,1.0,I'm so disappointed at this resturant. I went on memorial day to have lunch with my bf. We order hot wings and pizza right very simple. Server forgot to bring us utensils. When I wrapped the utensils they were dirty including the napkin it was wrapped in. Thats nasty. The hot wings came out first they look a bit undercook once I took a bite they were very rubbery. Ask our server to please take back and have them fully cook to a crunch. The pizza was cold by the time it got to our table oh yeah. I ask the server for plates to eat she just brought one plate. I was thinking its two of us eating. No attention to wgat was going on at our table. And it wasn't that busy. I've been to the bj that's in Downey so much better food and service. Never again.
Sergio Z.,Monterey Park  CA,4918,512,6963,12/8/2013,4.0,BJ is your average gastos/brewery restaurant plus a sport bar atmosphere always packed with raging fans rooting their favorite sports team. The food is really good depend on your choice of meal  you see in their menu if like pasta  pizza or burger even ribs. They have a good selection of their beer mix drinks including their limted and seasonal beer. Me and my wife order the bacon fritter they were so good we try them during the summer when they have the bbq deal. I order the crispy jalapeo burger with wedge fries  first I took a bite it was good it need more flavor but over all I enjoy it. My wife order the chicken pasta she enjoy it..oh yes I try their pumpkin ale very good with the taste of pumpkin.
Holly L.,Rosemead  CA,368,65,15,12/22/2013,1.0,"Im currently writing this from yard house in pasadena. My friend and I had just gotten off work and decided to come to BJs.We get to BJs and were greeted by the host and hostess. We were seated and thats where our service ended.We sat for about 10-12 minutes. During this time we made eye contact with many of the employees  all of which did not come to the table. We didnt even get a ""we will be right with you."" This has been by far the worst experience ive had. I dont see any reason to come back to this location. Ever. Im sure that maybe it is just one of those off nights but again  I see no reason for coming back which is a shame because I was invited to BJs by 3 employees who came to eat where I served and they were genuinely lovely people. Im glad that I didnt see any of those 3 working during tonights horrible service. Or lack of service."
Cesar V.,La Puente  CA,19,20,8,8/11/2015,1.0,Bad service  at the bar area  they keep forgetting drinks food  they bring the food and just drop it off  not realizing we don't have no plates or utensils on tables  the girls just drop of the food and don't bothered to ask if we need to any else or check our table to see if we miss anything  it took over 10 minutes to get 2 beers WOW! How hard is it to pour 2 beers and place was not pack  just don't get it  believe me I'm big tipper when it comes to Resturant service  but please do you job properly.
Anne Marie B.,Monrovia  CA,9,51,,6/21/2014,5.0,I know what the food will be like when I go to BJs since it's a chain. It's delicious  not very creative  but very fresh. I'm writing this review in regards to service I recently experienced. The service was superior! My waiter was Bobby Spider. He was attentive to all the tables even though it was really busy at lunch time. He really made our experience excellent with his inviting demeanor and attentiveness to my friend's dietary needs. Thanks  Bobby!
Jesse R.,Monterey Park  CA,204,83,39,1/2/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Went in yesterday to crab a bite. I used the bjs app to reserve a seat  Email confirmation was sent back to me for ten minutes. Keep in mind I was in the mall. I also went ahead and used the app to order ahead. When I arrived to the hostess station I was told I would have to wait another 15 minutes. The food was ordered and confirmed by the hostess so ok what choice do I have. We finally sat down and the hostess comes up to us to take our order. I informed her that we already ordered through the app. 10 minutes later she comes back and says our order was never processed. That's when I should have left. But we went ahead and placed out order again. Well my drink came out 5 minutes later and hers came out in ten. Our meals close in total 30 to 40 minutes later.  When asked what was going on. The blame game started and no one wanted to take responsibility   Why is this location always a bad spot to go to. Rumor has it it's a training site and the staff is raw.  Who knows but at least they are consistent with their bad service.
Darla D.,San Dimas  CA,165,881,671,3/19/2014,5.0,I like the food and drinks here. Happy Hour is always a plus. It can be very busy and parking is decent depending on what day of the week it is. I havent had a bad server as of yet and the Berry Burst Cider is my fav! Total Yumminess! My fav place to have drinks and apatizers in the bar on friday nights ...
Jason H.,Whittier  CA,0,5,,4/2/2016,1.0,Bad overall experience from the beginning  walked to our table on the most slippery greasy floors ever. Then they served my wife a gummy under cooked California Chicken sandwich. Then when I informed the manager of the meat he proceed to take food without asking what we would like to do with the plate of under cooked food or did not offer an apology. The waiter was not attentive at all and didn't offer much an apology for the food. The least that could have been done was to offer some sort of discount for the gross under cooked chicken that hopefully will not get her sick (time will tell). Horrible experience and we will never be attending this or possibly any BJ's again.
Jeanette D.,La Puente  CA,58,28,26,11/11/2014,1.0,Never coming here again. Waited 20 min to take my drinks and order. Then another 30 min for my water that never came so I just decided to leave. Wow! I'm so disappointed and very hungry. Sucks! So unprofessional. I wish businesses/restaurants could actually respect their customers. I've noticed now a days it's really difficult for businesses to actually do that. Oh well! Nothing I can do  but never come back. HORRIBLE SERVICE!
Joe G.,Montebello  CA,95,56,117,5/13/2014,4.0,I love the happy hour here! The Goliath IPA  hot wings  & avocado rolls are great! Been here quite a few times in the last few months and left with a big smile on my face each time:)
Vanesa G.,Los Angeles  CA,5,25,22,6/22/2015,3.0,Came to eat on Sunday Father's Day. Everything was good only had to wait 5min server Mike was great  food we didn't try it. I saw a roach come out underneath and we told the host and instead of killing it or removing it he walked to look for something 5 min later my husband had to get up and killed it.i couldn't stay sadly my husband really wanted to eat. Hope next time this doesn't happen
Angie W.,Alhambra  CA,1017,600,491,8/1/2013,4.0,We've been coming by for the good lunch specials.Lately  they have the BBQ lunch platter for $5.95 & comes with a pulled pork slider  bbq chicken breast  fries & cole slaw. Some of their salads are very tasty but small for lunch portions. They also have a pretty yummy flatbread pizza with side salad that's pretty delish also. Mainly a sports bar  the ambience is pretty relaxed & nicely decorated. Dinner & drinks are the perfect time for this establishment though the food prices can be high. The service can be slow but the food is better than most other restaurants in the vicinity. This location is located near the food court of the mall so when the wait is to long  we head over to the mall food court.
Christian R.,Monterey Park  CA,3,6,,9/26/2013,1.0,"Where do I start? Maybe the horrible service  the cold food?I rarely come to Bj\'s  if I do it\'s because it\'s near by and their happy hour specials are pretty good. Although  the most recent time I went  it was the worst experience yet. I ordered my food as soon as they sat me down. Maybe that confused them  who knows. But my platter didn\'t arrive until 52 minutes later! The place wasn\'t even busy. I had to ask my waiter if there was a problem with my order. He assured me other wise. When my food arrived (small pizza and fries) it was COLD  as if they had it sitting there not knowing who ordered it. I kindly asked for a new order  when they arrive with ""my"" food it\'s not the same thing I ordered. Last time I will come to this place. It\'s no better then applebees."
Jesse A.,Montebello  CA,1,17,1,9/10/2015,5.0,Came to dinner with the family. We were greeted at the door by the friendly staff! We felt so welcome! Darlena and Rae took our names and seated us in a prompt and friendly manner! We were unfortunately seated in a round booth but upon asking for a long booth they rectified the situation even though it was crowded due to the game. Darlena came and switched us likity swift. We always love coming here! Loyal customers!
Albert C.,Huntington Park  CA,96,73,42,11/10/2013,4.0,Some of these reviews are too much. This is not a fine dining establishment  just in case you guys didn't know. This is a chain restaurant and better than the alternatives in the area. Sure  we have our bad experiences but some of you are being babies... I've been here multiple times and have never had any issues. If the service is a little slow on the weekend  I don't mind because it allows more time to socialize  but come on now... You're expecting fast service during peak hours? You deserve one-star not the restaurant.
Marcy M.,Stevenson Ranch  CA,0,3,,8/6/2015,4.0,Came here for dinner last night at about 8:30pm because it's within walking distance of our hotel. Food and service was good  nothing to complain about. I was with 6 other people and they all enjoyed their meals and drinks as well. Black and blue burger with wedge fries and 2 dark castles after a 5 hour drive hit the spot.
Toni A.,Montebello  CA,92,35,123,3/27/2014,3.0,They make their own Black Cherry & Root beer sodas. Can't go with out ordering the pisookie trio too.
Tesh R.,Ontario  CA,79,132,74,1/10/2016,2.0,"First time at this place ever. We sat at the bar to avoid the long wait for a table. The servers were nice. Food was meh. My husband had the bison burger (yeah  IDK wth he was thinking!) and he said it was very bland. The burger also fell apart as he ate it making it less than enjoyable. The presentation was meh. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good  but nothing to do back flips about. We didn\'t bother to try the pazookie we always hear about. A guy sat next to me who couldn\'t get a drink because his ID was expired (lmao) and tried to bribe the bartender with ""favors"" from the dealership he worked at (what a joke). One of the servers got smacked in the face by the door and none of her coworkers bothered to go to her aide (talk about team work!). I felt bad for her as she stood there holding her nose and people were just laughing! Just awful!!! As far as returning  only if the wait at Olive Garden is beyond ridiculous."
Kristina B.,Los Angeles  CA,163,61,1,10/31/2014,5.0,I'm giving this location a 5 star rating for several reasons. There's always parking since it's attached to a mall  even if you have to walk a little (don't be lazy. you're probably going to the mall to WALK around anyways). Service is usually fast. If on the rare occasion I can't find something at the bar  I'm usually seated within 10min. The servers are generally attentive  fast  and friendly. The food is always delicious BJs quality. I truly have nothing poor to say about this location or my experiences. It's perfect after a long day of shopping or just to grab some drinks with friends.
Chi T.,San Gabriel  CA,146,356,138,6/20/2012,3.0,I've eaten here a few times  and the food is usually mediocre  at best. But this time  I was in for a treat! I ordered their PM Porter beer and accompanied it with the bbq ribs per the menu suggestion. Well  the beer was surprising very good. It went down very smoothly and didn't have the strong alcohol taste. The ribs were delicious! I had the half order  which was quite big. I had to take half of it home. The meat was tender and fell right off the bone. Now  I'm not sure who writes the beer and food pairing  but I don't think these two went well together. The ribs were good and so was the beer  but when combined  the ribs cancel out the taste of the beer. I felt like I was drinking water. The taste of the ribs was so strong that it made the beer bland. So...the ribs were good as was the beer  but just not together. Maybe you can down a few brewskies and then order the ribs.
Davina D.,Rosemead  CA,76,143,25,2/11/2015,4.0,I really like BJs. I have eaten most of their food before and drank all the beers since I had an ex that worked there for a few years so I know how things are supposed to be and how they operate. I was a little dissapointed last time I went cuz they are getting skimpier with their food! I got the spring rolls and they are super small now. I also got my favorite vege potatoe but it's not enormous anymore! It used to be as long and as fat as a long plate they used to serve it on but it looks like a regular size now on a small plate  I couldn't find it on the menu either for dinner so I had to ask for it. I really enjoyed the roasted brussel sprouts which is new and you can share that with like 3 or 4 ppl since its a lot! Another favorite is the chicken parmesan  yummy. Pizzas are good too along with the famous pazookie dessert! I still enjoy this place cuz the food quality is worth it despite them down sizing the food a bit.
Gabby N.,Los Angeles  CA,14,10,36,9/22/2014,1.0,Customer Service Sucked. Employees were Rude and not very patient. Also my sister read something off the menu and the waiter in a very rude manner corrected her.
Kevin M.,Alhambra  CA,3,11,3,10/11/2014,2.0,Horrible service. Even the manager was awful. Just awful. I am never coming back. They forgot our drinks. Food took 30 minutes after our drinks and then the manager asked if we needed anything  and didnt come back with it. WHY BOTHER.
David B.,El Monte  CA,24,11,8,9/15/2014,2.0,I miss old Pazookie that BJ's use to make. Came here for lunch and order Pazookie and use to get 10% cookie and now you only get 5% but after baking cookie and thats if its not over cooked you only get 3% . The Pazookie I got today was hardly any cookie mostly scrapping metal pan with my spoon. Maybe BJ's wanted to cut back on the cookie dough used. If this is how they want to make the Pazookie's now then I will stop ordering dessert
Jennifer G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,66,71,4/4/2015,1.0,Service always sucks at this Bj's they always take forever to come take your order and they take even more time to serve your food. I literally have to order my dessert once my food arrives because they'll take another hour to bring it out. If you are starving I would not recommend to come eat here!
Allison W.,Monterey  CA,0,17,,6/12/2015,5.0,My family and I stopped by today for a quick bite. The food was amazing but the best part was our server Roquel. She was lively  quick  and made our experience worth while. We watched her be sat 6 tables IN A ROW and still managed to keep everyone happy. Bravo Roquel!
Michelle G.,Montebello  CA,1,4,,11/14/2014,1.0,Really really bad service!!!!! No joke the waitress sat us down and left she never came back not even if we wanted a drink. We asked another waitress if she could help us and she said I'll find out what's going on! That girl Never came back!! We just left. Instead of staying we went to KING TACO WAY BETTER. .
Michael Anthony H.,Glendale  CA,890,97,20,7/27/2013,2.0,"I have always liked the service and food at my local BJs in Glendale  so when some relatives came into town from Northern California  I figured it would be a safe bet to meet them for dinner at the BJs across from their hotel in Montebello. As usual  the food was good  but the service was not as good as the food.We called about 10 minutes before walking in and gave our name and how many folks were in our party. They said there would be no wait when we got there. Walked in and gave the name  and they said they don\'t take reservations  so we waited 10 minutes for a table to open up.Waitress took our orders  but we never saw her again for the rest of the night. Our food was brought out by other servers  and for some reason  one of the kid\'s orders didn\'t show up until 10 to 15 minutes after everyone else was served. I even had to ask another waitress where his order was before it finally came out.Again  our original server was never to be seen nor did anyone come to check on us until we were almost done with the meal.Finally  a new server comes over and starts taking care of us  but never did advise us of any shift change  nor did she even introduce herself  but hey  we were getting full at that point  so I let it slide.Then  it happens......The power goes out in the restaurant  and we are sitting there for 45 minutes in complete darkness with an ear piercing piezo fire alarm and flashing strobes. In my younger years  I would have ordered a couple shots and enjoyed the light show  but we were busy catching up with our relatives. The waitress comes to the table and advises us that she will have to manually calculate our tab and asks us what we ordered. She returns with the homemade receipt and advises us that we are only getting charged for the entrees. That the drinks and appetizers would be waived for the inconvenience. Considering our drink order consisted of 3 kids drinks and one adult drink and 3 waters and the appetizer being calamari  I gladly accepted the discount. Handed over a large bill and again sat in complete darkness to wait for the change.Waitress comes back and hands me the tab folder and quickly utters that she found my ""correct"" bill and quickly walks away. I open up the folder and see that I was billed full price ""for the inconvenience.""Whatever happened to customer satisfaction and keeping your word on something you offered to the customer?THANKS BJs for cutting our mini family reunion short tonight...."
LA Slug V.,Los Angeles  CA,37,88,129,3/9/2014,4.0,I like coming to this place to watch sports  eat pizza and drink beer. It gets packed during football season and any playoff game so get to the bar early if you want to sit by the big screen. They have smaller TVs all over so most seats in the house are pretty good. Good food and service. More importantly a solid selection of beers to choose from.
T L.,San Francisco  CA,26,439,383,9/9/2014,1.0,Not one of our best experiences. Service was super slow that we had to keep reminding them about our orders. Pizza was not completely baked that we had to send back  salads that took an hour and just not organized like a big establishment should be. We will not be returning any time soon. The best parts was that they had lots of room  modern style and a huge bar area.
L R.,Yorba Linda  CA,0,31,19,4/7/2015,1.0,"Would have scored no stars just like Angelica (#228)  our server (if we freely assign titles to the lazy). I had to order my water multiple times and though I understand we are in the middle of a drought  the eye rolling was a bit much. Angelica\'s awesomeness was followed by asking if we wanted dessert  cool right! Well  it would have been had I not been in the middle of my dinner  actively putting food in my mouth. Maybe I led her astray with the whole eating thing because shortly thereafter she brought the bill.  I hope Angelica learns some manners and comes to understand the premise behind ""you catch more flies with honey."""
Cathy L.,San Gabriel  CA,244,28,5,3/3/2014,4.0,PLEASE DO NOT GET THE SPAGHETTI WIT MEAT SAUCE AND MEATBALLS!!!! Save ur money for something way better! its so bland and barely had any sauce at all. I had to ask for more sauce and they gave me 2. When I asked for sauce for to go since I couldn't finish it  they gave me 2 sauces again (cause they know its so dry and bland). I would definitely need those 2 sauces when I eat it as leftovers :( The big appetizer plate was probably the best thing of the night  a few people said that at my table of 11 and I would have to agreeThe service is superb!!!!! Our original waitress went on break so another waitress helped us and this waitress was so much better!!! She was enthusiastic and seemed like she actually liked her job or at least didn't mind serving you. The first one was more like a robot. blahh!
April P.,East Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,80,9,4,4/5/2015,2.0,This place sucks the service was terrible the waitress took 30 minutes to take our drinks. Normally I understand food takes a while to cook but there were hardly any people here today and it was still taking forever.
Tommy Smalls S.,Pico Rivera  CA,30,54,75,4/1/2015,5.0,Great service from Alex. He went out of his way to make sure my table stood full. He looked out for us on happy hour and all. Over all he made this a very good visit plus a well deserved tip. Peace Tsmalls
Sandra R.,Montebello  CA,0,83,32,4/23/2014,5.0,Lllooovveee coming here. Love the grilled Atlantic salmon..mushrooms appietizers... Love the ambience... Def reccomend it...
Arric B.,El Monte  CA,1,10,19,6/17/2015,4.0,Good food / great service! Patricio did a great job of getting us exactly what we ordered in a timely manner. He continuously checked on us to make sure we were content with our food and service. I had the club sandwich which was a little too salty for my taste and the mozzarella stick were a little too fried but the rest of the dinner was good.
Rom S.,Los Angeles  CA,1,38,8,10/20/2014,1.0,"This place is a ridiculous  I was there a few times and got bad service every time  it\'s like no one there is even care  the food comes different then what is the menu and the servers are almost rude  I got bad service in the bar and on a table as well  one time I was waiting for my order on the bar for so long when ppl around me came after me and served before me just cuz I am a regular  when the food came so late  my table wasn\'t even set yet. When I called the server on that he opinionated at me deciding I am ""cranky cuz I\'m hungry and I am afraid my food will not come"" no I am cranky cuz your service sucks. I called the head quarter got the same attitude  I guess the fish stick from the head. Now I only getting to go orders to avoid the horrible service."
Gabriel F.,Whittier  CA,0,12,,9/9/2014,1.0,As always terrible service. Every time I go to bjs this happens unless I sit at the bar where my tender can't go far. 9 out of 10.Times there is a mistake with my food or check. Almost always trouble with the wait  for table to b cleared.(when sitting in bats first come first serve)   my drinks  food  check..The servers are given too many tables at once n it's impossible for then to keep up sometimes. But neuter them or the management care because the more tables the more money! The less servers the lessmoney to spend on payroll..another company who only cares about prpfit. I go cuz the happy hour drinks r good price for good quality.but I would suggest going to be cheesecake factory if u want quality food n good service.
Anita G.,Pico Rivera  CA,2,38,18,4/12/2015,2.0,Still not impressed with this place  and that's why I stopped coming here. Service was horrible  no refills on drinks  no asking how we are doing  and dirty plates left on tables from previous patrons. We were escorted to our dirty table  but had to wait for it to ne cleaned before we could sit.
Fairuza H.,Los Angeles  CA,4,12,14,6/6/2015,4.0,OMG today was the best day at BJ's! I had the best dinner while everyone was screaming for the soccer game! Go Barcelona! Woo! Woo!
Joel B.,Los Angeles  CA,41,17,8,4/9/2015,3.0,It's disappointing that my favorite restaurant have so many flaws. I've moved from Temecula less than a year ago and the BJs there does not compare to any other in this area. This is my family first visit to thus location. Our host sat us in the center aisle where is the busiest. Problem is that I have a 3 yr old girl and a 6 month old boy that we don't like to sit on high chairs for safety issues. We asked to sit on a booth and the hostess was kind enough to accommodate us on a booth at the far end of the restaurant by the restrooms(I did not mind that). The waitress came to take our drink and appetizer order but we went ahead and order our main meal along with appetizers. We received our meal and drinks  no appetizers. The waitress completely forgot about our appetizers. Any other place would've gave us a free lemonade or something for the trouble. We just got an apology.
Angel A.,Temple City  CA,4,9,2,4/6/2015,1.0,This place is insane! So I'm sitting at the bar and I finish one drink  can you tell me why I waited an hour for my husband to actually order my drink. I'm at the bar!! If my drink is done why the hell wouldn't you ask me if I wanted another drink! This is fucking insane!
Jose M.,Los Angeles  CA,3,5,8,11/8/2013,1.0,Very rude service as soon as I walked through the door. The food here is not fresh and I will not recommend this place to anyone unless u like paying top dollar for a frozen TV dinner! Long wait time and unhelpful front desk plus bad food! Next time I'll just try the food court at the mall!
Eric M.,Santa Monica  CA,364,426,116,9/9/2013,4.0,BJ's is BJ's. You know what you're going to get. The four stars is purely for the service. It is fantastic. Friendly and attentively. We also enjoy the $20 deal. Two salads/soups  any medium pizza  and dessert. Unbeatable.
Eder P.,Los Angeles  CA,355,605,122,7/29/2011,4.0,Every Bj's I go to is always great.Good service  nice servers. Food always comes fast  which is amazing.I always fear they have these plates ready and they just microwave em' since it comes out fo the kitchen so fast.I read other people's reviews... sorry you're dumb if you dip you're steak in tabasco sauce... there's a thing called STEAK SAUCE... so I'm guessing the problem with BJ's is that people that never go to restaurants and the only thing they know is BJ's can easily complain.You know there's a few Taco spots down the street I'm pretty sure would suit their small brains.Go here and enjoy some good food. I had the Pork chop from the healthy part of the menu. Good eatin' with that there.Oh and give their mojitos a shot too. No drink on their list is a wrong choice.
Rios M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,11/22/2014,1.0,"5pm 11/22/14- First off let me say that we never received our appetizers and they still tried charging us for them until I brought it up to the server. Then on our way out I asked for the 4 piece pilsner cup set that was advertised for $11+ tax and the manager  Mark H charged me for each individual one  and the total came out to $15.26. When I brought it up he said thats how much it\'s supposed to be with tax which is bull. When my friend payed for his individual cup he gave him the exact change. Mark dropped it then told another server  ""It\'s not the right change  he probably lied. "" I also heard Mark talking rude to his server telling the young man ""get over here  NOW."" in a horrible tone. If I could I would give this place no stars."
Nelson B.,San Gabriel  CA,2,122,67,2/8/2015,1.0,I recall trying there breakfast and it was delicious. However  today experience was horrible from beginning to the end. First of all  the server can't get my order correct and had to correct her 3 times. Second of all  they kept forgetting to bring the food I ordered. Third  once the food came out it tasted disgusting. The country potatoes were bland. The pancakes were just as bad. I will not come here ever again.
Angela T.,El Monte  CA,209,304,171,5/2/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Yet another bad service review. I think they really messed it up for me this time.. If you can see  they just lost a star from my previous review.I ordered Parmesan Chicken. Some way or another  my waitress can mess it up and bring me Chicken Parmagiana or something of that sort. I tell her and she gives me the worst attitude ever with annoyance in her voice and her eyes rolling! To avoid missing my class  I say  I'll just keep it  even though I'm furious. Good thing  the manager came over and apologized and tried to fix things! (he's the reason why I'm not giving it 1 star!) He took our appetizer off the bill and we just paid for the entrees that were ordered.The order I got? It was horrible. After I ate it  I literally felt nauseous. The chicken wasn't even chicken. It's was breaded cheese with cheese on top. -_______- Their spaghetti with spicy marinara sauce tasted like plastic. I don't even know what to say. Whoever cooked my dish needs to be fired. Immediately. Especially when he's cooking that crap? Me thinks so.
Rick S.,Upland  CA,15,74,4,3/10/2013,1.0,"From what I understand  BJ\'s-es (what\'s the plural of BJ\'s?!) are very good. I wouldn\'t know. I\'ve been in the lobby of the one in the Montebello Town Center  but that\'s it. We walked into the restaurant and stood in plain sight in front of the desk where three female staff members were deeply enthralled in their own conversation. It must have been extremely important  because they never said a word to my friend and me. They never even looked our way. So ... I walked to the counter  not 6 feet away from them. Still nothing. I cleared my throat loudly. Nothing. I said  ""Excuse me."" More nothing. We left. I\'m sorry  but I don\'t want to beg to be noticed in a restaurant. I want to be more important than staff members\' gossip. . It\'s funny  I didn\'t get a single morsel of food or sip of drink at the Montebello BJ\'s  but I left with a terrible taste in my mouth!"
Jolene B.,Montebello  CA,3,9,,4/30/2015,3.0,Bj's Pizza is beautiful inside and out there are just a few things that i was not happy with one my food took very long to come and our server as well. The food was good but needed more flavor on the chicken alfredo.
Naomi D.,Glendora  CA,89,8,,5/30/2015,3.0,The food here is good but the service needs work. It took us over an hour to get our food. It shouldn't have taken that long.
Sam E.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,2/15/2016,3.0,Only reason this place is getting a 3 is because our server Jennifer was awesome! Great service by her! The host in the front with short hair and the girl that sat us were pretty rude. She awkwardly offered us a spot at the bar but we declined  and when we did she rolled her eyes. Her and the other girl seemed pretty high but hey more power to ya.
Mary B.,Huntington Beach  CA,1,19,6,5/27/2015,2.0,This restaurant has gone down in quality of food lately. It is extreme large and loud. Servers are overworked and snippy. The chili tastes like it came from a can but the macadamia nut pizzoki is pretty good. Hostess are always pleasant. Management is rude and corporate doesn't care as I texted them. BJ's has grown too fast. No longer personalized .It is good place to grab an ale though and watch a game if you're in the Mall
Nicole G.,Las Vegas  NV,743,446,402,5/29/2011,2.0,Pizoooooooooooooooookie!yep thats the only reason why i like this place & think it's okay..The pazookie is the ultimate desert. Giant cookie that has the taste that can blow your mind  yep I order it every time! other than that the food is just like every where else.. plain.The pizza has no flavor  and the last time i got pizza here it was cold. WTF!? Considering that when i came it was slow that is just unacceptable.Had the steak and it was super overdone. I don't even think my dog would have wanted to chew on that. he'd pick his bone.The veggies here have no seasoning. Were they just picked form the ground. Um no  that would have to mean they're fresh and they certainly taste frozen. Good place to come in groups. There service is not bad. Not exceptional though. They do they're job and do nothing more. Not up to my standards thats for sure.
Cindy L.,Los Angeles  CA,181,770,55,11/11/2011,4.0,BJ's Happy Hour: Mon - Fri (3-7pm) & Sun - Thurs (10pm - close) - yep! late night HH!!! At the bar - self seating  good amount of space. Specials: $1 off beer; $2 off appetizers (excluding small bites & snacks? or something); Half off mini pizzas (comes out to about $5-6 during HH). We tried their buffalo chicken mini pizza (4 slices) & it was really delicious! Full of flavor and not skimpy on chicken. Crust was a little soggy though. Also got their chilli cheese nachos (called something else on their menu) & it was MASSIVE. I think we barely made a dent in it. The weird thing is that the chilli is in the bottom of the dish  so it was challenging at the beginning to get some chips & chilli together. Taste wise  even though fresh  it could've used chicken (add'l charge) & some guacamole. Yard House Chicken nachos are waaaaaay better & cheaper during their HH. The time frame & the variety of offerings is good enough for me to want to come back & try out more things. Service is definitely lacking/slow but understandable because they are usually SWAMPED with customers. So patience comes in handy. Be prepared to flag a server down after you get seated for menus/orderings & such. Parking: easy - outdoor montebello mall parking (but probably nightmarish around the holidays)
David A.,Costa Mesa  CA,1067,580,1043,12/17/2010,3.0,Typical for a BJs  but not my favorite (HB is). Smaller than most. Its one redeaming factor (if you call it one) is that it is attached to a mall. Only one that I know that has that feature.Wait staff was nice. Clients were friendly  though sloshed.I continue to order off their secret menu (Flatbread pizzas can be ordered of any of their specials and those are half off during happy hour. You can also usually order off the lunch menu at any time.). Am very disappointed that they took the shrimp skewers off the small bites menu. Pushing them to get them back on.
Christopher B.,Tampa  FL,29,6,4,2/7/2015,4.0,Delicious food  although the service from the hostesses can be a bit spotty at times. Still  great environment to watch a sports game as it is spacious and very welcoming for large parties. Give it a shot!
Travis C.,Whittier  CA,0,2,,5/3/2015,1.0,Let me start by saying love bjs pizza go at least 2 times a week..but after my visit to the one in monobello.. Was waiting over 30 min to just get some water. They seated a couple next to us and they got there water within 3 min.. They said y they didn't even know who my server was. I left went Applebee's got my drinks and appetizers within 10 min..I would give no star if poss. Never will I go to bjs again in any state or county
D J.,Pico Rivera  CA,16,3,9,4/29/2015,5.0,Pretty cool for a wed. Out having drinks with some friends didn't expect so many peeps out but enjoying the evening out.
Stacy K.,Brea  CA,0,40,10,1/4/2015,1.0,"My fianc and I came in today for brunch. It was really slow. We walked up to 5 girls in the front sitting there chit chatting. Not at all friendly! We stood there for 5 mins just looking at them until a girl said ""I can take you"" we followed her to the table and was seated. When I asked for a booth she replied ""there\'s nothing open you\'re going to have to go back up and wait"" the place was empty!! So I said nvm it\'s fine. We sat and here comes our waitress. She didn\'t introduce herself and seemed miserable to be at work. barely opened her mouth and I could barely hear her. She didn\'t have a smile on her face. It was as if I was interrupting her lunch!! When I asked for a turkey club (I read it on the (menu) she said we dont have that. She didn\'t give me other options. She just stared at me. The worst service ever!!"
Kayden H.,Los Angeles  CA,19,114,1189,3/5/2013,4.0,Try this place back when it barely open in the mall  but been wanting to come back since I have been getting advisement in the mail about there lunch special. Came on a weekday and the place was pack  so it must be good. Got the lunch specials and some burgers. Everything was good  and service was fast and friendly. Probably will be coming back to try other things on the menu during lunch.
Jessica S.,El Monte  CA,2,8,5,3/22/2015,5.0,Bianca is the best server ever!!!!!!!!! Extremely nice and very attentive!!!!! She's awesome and the food is awesome as well :)
Steve C.,Pasadena  CA,2,10,,7/26/2015,5.0,Good food and friendly service! The pizookie is really good too  they give a free one on your birthday!
Norberto S.,Los Angeles  CA,24,23,5,5/9/2011,2.0,"I ordered a Top Sirloin Steak and trust me  there was nothing ""Top"" about it.Almost thought I was chewing on some gum  the steak felt dry. I had to submerge it in a sea of Tabasco sauce before I was able to get a good taste from it."
Nicole G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,34,5,2/18/2014,4.0,We ate here over the weekend and the food was delicious as always. The service was exceptional. Unfortunately I don't remember our waiter's name but he was great with the kids and the service was super fast. The best food on the menu is the Brewhouse Black and Bleu Burger. I wish I could afford to eat there everyday  both in my wallet and in my waist. The Bloody Mary is pretty great too.
Marco J.,Los Angeles  CA,155,217,468,10/13/2011,2.0,I sometimes come here with my coworkers after work. Let me start off by saying that the service is pretty much bad to moderate on any given day. The only time I had good service at this BJs was on a slow day when I sat at the bar with a date and the bartender was very nice. Besides that  the waiters and waitresses often forget orders  take too long just to bring drinks  and will sometimes bring you your box for leftovers like half an hour after you asked for it.Now onto the food. It's pretty much basic fare. The broccoli cheddar soup is really good  as are the wings and stuffed mushrooms. Everything else is pretty much OK. I've tasted much better sandwiches and fries elsewhere. The real highlights are their Pizookie dessert and their Irish Root Beer drink. 2 1/2 stars.
Sophia P.,Alhambra  CA,70,13,17,6/21/2014,5.0,The server there by the name Jonathan is the best server ever! Super attentive and so nice to us! He definitely deserves a raise $$$ oh and food is good as always
Vanessa P.,Bell Gardens  CA,3,8,11,1/31/2015,4.0,Customer service is great I love coming here every weekend  but unfortunately I'm disappointed that they no longer have the swirly noodles for the Alfredo pasta. That's the only reason I come to BJ's all the time! All my friends loved them and my family now I got to break the news to them :(
Derek W.,Los Angeles  CA,466,631,2464,11/20/2010,3.0,Located minutes away from work  not sure why I don't head here for take out food more often. I've only been here a few times  but recently a coworker ordered their Mediterranean pizza and damn was it tasty. We also ordered some of their chicken wings to share. What's weird is that they don't toss their buffalo wings with the hot sauce and just simply package it on the side for you. I have not dined inside the restaurant so I'm not sure whether they do this on purpose (to keep the wings crispy?) or not but it is different.Will have to try some of their other dishes one day.
Liz D.,South Pasadena  CA,81,116,38,5/1/2014,1.0,"For the start we got the calamari rings  to eat she had the burger and i had the shrimp scampi with clam chowder soup. I forgot the girls name but she was a little weird. Not friendly and not rude  just weird. She asked about my watch and when i told her where i had gotten it she made a face. I don\'t know why  but whatever  bring me my food!!*I understand that the calamari rings are fried  I\'ve eaten them plenty of times. These were disgustingly drenched in oil. It was more oil than calamari GROSS!* Clam Chowder was good in salt and flavor.* The shrimp scampi had more than 5 pieces of shrimp which was awesome! The taste of the sauce was a little off  it had that burnt taste to it. Since I was hungry I ate some and took the rest home. When we were done the girl brought back the check and kept standing around for us to pay  i thought that was a little rude  especially since we weren\'t done with our food and drinks. Once I was done paying She brought back my receipt and was out of our sight. We left 30mins after that. I never once bothered to check and see if my credit card was back in my purse. Went to work the next day and as i was pulling into the gas station i began to pull my hair because my card was not in my purse  little did i know my card was back at BJ\'s!!!!! I called right away to find out ; the girl who answered asked me a million questions just to ""verify"" if it was my card. For example: What color is the card? Whats the name on the card? What kind of card is it? What are the last four numbers on the card? What are the last three numbers on the card?... IS IT MY FUUUUUU**ING CARD OR NOT????? I was frustrated and going crazy  she finally said:""yes its here  will you be picking it up today?"" Me: Yes! I will be swinging by tonight at 10 or 11 pm!!!Her: Not a problem see you tonight!I showed up later that night at 11:15pm just to hear ""sorry we don\'t have any cards with that name"" WTF!!!That was another scene! Long story short  i had to wait 30mins to speak to a manger before i got my card. Never again BJ\'s of Montebello"
Kat G.,Los Angeles  CA,179,60,2,4/10/2013,3.0,"Okay  I love the food here  I love the drinks here  but I am really not a fan of the service. Don\'t get me wrong  the service here isn\'t TERRIBLE  but it\'s definitely not worth the amount of money you end up spending here. I think that a place like this  that tries to pride itself on somewhat ""gourmet"" food and drinks  should really also work on Grade A customer service as well. Luckily for me  I haven\'t had just one bad experience with the service here  my opinion of the service is mostly based on the fact that every time that I\'ve been here  the service was just not that great. I\'m giving 3 stars because I still enjoy their food & beer. Minus two stars due to long waits (even on weeknights?!) and waiters/waitresses who rush your order  get it wrong and constantly have to be reminded to bring something you asked for. You know what though? All in all  the bad service still isn\'t enough to keep away from this place . . . it just makes it so that this place is not my first choice in restaurant/bars to eat at."
Satish E.,Montebello  CA,7,2,,3/29/2015,4.0,I had been here for 3-4 times... you get chilled brewed beer... food is good too...! I like tavern cut pizzas here...only problem with this place is that it's crowded on weekends and u need to wait for the table...
Kevin R.,Montebello  CA,0,2,,3/11/2015,1.0,Ordered the fish n chips  received 2 pieces of burnt fish  and 2 pieces of batter with no fish inside! I was looking forward to it  and it was so disappointing!! The server was very nice.
Kevin S.,Brea  CA,180,312,35,4/13/2011,3.0,The food and drinks are all fairly priced for the quality of food and venue  and there are plenty of TV's here to watch the game on.I give this BJ's location minus one star from my Brea location review simply because this one is super crowded a lot of the time (especially during Laker games)  which for me makes it much less desirable to go to.
Rolando P.,Los Angeles  CA,34,206,183,8/15/2012,2.0,2.5......Waiter was distracted and not attentive.He would disappear for long periods of time (about 10 mins at a time).
Cintya P.,La Quinta  CA,190,441,517,1/12/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I just came back from BJ's and I think it's time to update my review from the last time when I stated that my job here was TEMPORARY. Yes  I came back after a couple of months and it seems not much has changed. Well  they do have some new menu items like the mini tacos  the spinach stuffed mushrooms  the BJ's baked beignet and the berry crumble. Nothing too spectacular to me though.However  I can say that the service tonight was one of the best I've ever had at BJ's! Maybe because it was Happy Hour (3-7pm) and the waiter was such a nice guy and the hot wings were decent! It was a good night at BJ's in Montebello after a hard day of work! On the other hand  I did not really get that WOW factor that BJ's strives for.  I'll leave at three stars because of the service tonight.
Mr. M.,Las Vegas  NV,224,78,87,6/4/2014,4.0,sat at the bar and order some drinks. happy hour pricing is on point. The food needs a little help but still not bad for the price. Bartenders make nice drinks and pour beer correctly. They are also friendly and helpful. Hostess needs work  they are to busy tending to their own needs.
McQueen Q.,Montebello  CA,4,102,18,8/3/2014,3.0,I personally like this place  but my husband hates it. I love there Long Island and the sampler appetizer is so good. Every time I've gone I have had great service but this last time I have got really disappointed. The waitress never came to our table. In order to order we would have to get the attention of Another waitress. My husband hates this place since they don't accept his ID since it's a Mexican is. Even if he takes a passport they go ask there manager .
Ashley V.,San Gabriel  CA,198,228,148,5/23/2013,3.0,I've come here numerous times  and each time was a hit-or-miss. Sometimes I get great customer service  sometimes not so much.Food is average. They have a good selection to choose from  ranging from sandwiches  to pizza  to salad  etc.Wait time here is usually a while bc it's always packed. It's conveniently located at the Montebello Town Center  so I'm sure alot of people go eat after shopping.Since it's at the mall  parking is mall parking.
isaac b.,South Gate  CA,12,8,,5/21/2012,1.0,This is a review of my experience at this location that i left on BJ's Facebook wall.Just want to share my worst experience ever at a BJ's restaurant. Last thursday  i called BJ's Montebello to place an order to go (mini pizza  grilled chicken salad  pasta and 3 soups). That was at about 11:05  5 mins after opening. They took the order down fine and said it would be about 20-25 mins. So i drove over  got there 25 mins after i called. They said the food would be a few mins  i said thats fine and took a seat. About ten minutes after  they came out to tell me they dont have the soups i ordered. Also that their computers were down. Fine  i cancelled one soup and replaced the other one with a soup they did have at the time. As all this was happening  several customers came in after me  picked up their food and were out. So i had now been sitting there for about 20 mins. I eventually had to get up and ask for my food. They said  since our computers are down  we cant remove the soup from the bill and just stared at me  maybe just waiting for me to say thats fine? The employee helping me had a very poor and rude attitude. I could tell she was very frustrated  but that is no reason for them to take it out on a customer  especially one that has been waiting for over 20 mins for food ordered over 45 mins before. So she eventually took the soup off the bill by using a calculator like i suggested  she took a carbon copy of my credit card and just handed me my bag. No sorry for the wait  sorry for the inconvenience. Nothing!I did not receive a receipt  and to top everything off  when i got to my destination  The chicken on the grilled chicken pasta was badly charred  and no i did not order the blackened chicken  and they did not throw in the side of buffalo sauce i ordered for my pizza  which was also made very sloppy. I have been going to bj's for years  and only once or twice been disappointed  but i have continued to go  because of the awesome food. But after this  it will be a long long time before i go back to a BJ's restaurant. And i will NEVER go to BJ's Montebello  even if lunch is paid for by a friend. Please take a look into the opperation at this location. My sister  for whom i bought the food  also says she's had poor experiences at that location. Her and her husband also refuse to eat there. Thank you.
Byron A.,VALLEY VILLAGE  CA,41,131,17,9/14/2012,4.0,A lot of negative reviews on this BJ's. I wonder why.My experience was pleasant. We were seated immediately and our waitress was really helpful and attentive. I live near the Burbank area so have only been to the BJ's in Burbank  but this one wasn't bad. Same selection of foods and drinks (it is a chain after all) and even though I usually stick to the pizza this time around I decided to try a low calorie chicken item on the menu and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was.Overall it was a good dinner experience.
Mimi C.,Arlington  VA,811,2310,472,5/23/2010,4.0,Fast  efficient and always yummy food. I really have no complaints about BJ's  it's such a wonder how they get so much food out to so many people in such a short amount of time. What's nice about this BJ's is that it's in the mall  so you can get your shopping done when you're done. :)
Joelle R.,Covina  CA,42,79,5,3/30/2014,1.0,Been here a few times and just like everyone else says  the service sucks. Other locations are much busier  yet you get better service there. They make you wait forever for drink order  food order  and anything else you may need. Food is okay if its not served to you cold because they took forever. I would drive a little further to avoid this location.
Regina X.,Los Angeles  CA,251,29,10,11/17/2014,5.0,Food is good felt a little rushed with the tab but they are just doing their job. It was a busy night other than that its a great place better than apple bees I will definitely keep coming back.
Lizzy M.,North Las Vegas  NV,54,13,10,11/12/2014,5.0,Wow! On my way I called ahead for a party of 6. They put us on the list and by the time we got there  our wait was less then 10 mins. It was a Saturday night at 7. So of course it was packed! I couldn't even tell. The service was absolutely awesome. Also the chicken wings were amazing. The quality was through the roof. Our pizza's were served quickly and were delicious. Also. We got a free pizzokie even though our bill was only $98.70. I totally recommend this BJS for any size party. Food was good  the service was better!
John D.,East Los Angeles  CA,1,10,,7/4/2015,1.0,First started coming here a few years ago on a regular basis and it was okay. Recently it's gone downhill. Always mess up our order and double charge us. Management sucks. Staff are nice but incompetent. Just save yourself some money and go to McDonalds.
Lorraine S.,Downey  CA,0,4,,6/6/2014,1.0,Awful  awful  awful!! Came here for an end of school year luncheon. I swear everything was prepared in advance! As soon as we sat down  no sooner than 10 minutes our food was served! Cold DRY burgers and cold pasta dishes! The female bartender...a true snooty patootie!! A not so good experience! I give it a one star  because our waitress was sweet. BJ's is so over rated! I use to enjoy the chain...but recently it's taken a dive...even the lemon drops...not so good anymore.
Paul D.,Los Angeles  CA,11,38,11,5/20/2010,3.0,I honestly love BJ's and constantly go as often as I can.Let's start with the hostess  I don't remember her name exactly and I wish I took it down but she wore eye glasses... I know I know that doesn't really narrow it down but whoever she was  she had to be one of the worst hostesses I've ever experienced at a restaurant. She did not even say one word. After she was assigned to us she just expected you to follow her without acknowledgment and just stood by a table without telling you directly that it was your table. Sure I guess these are little complaints but communication between an employee and a guest would not hurt.So just like the BJ's in Burbank we had to wait in between 15-20 minutes just for someone to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Because so much time had elapsed we were also ready to order our food but they just left once they took our drinks down... WTF?!?! So another 20 minutes passes by and our drinks finally arrive and our main order is finally taken down... Another 20 minutes and we were finally in pasta heaven...See... I do love the food quality from BJ's but the service is so close to $4!T it's not even funny... We had an apathetic hostess and literally waited in between 50 minutes to a whole hour just to enjoy a meal... If I would've known this was going to happen I would've just eaten at the Jack In The Box down the street and gotten my food within 5 minutes to enjoy...So a 3 is all they get just cuz they got the food right...
Bethany E.,Simi Valley  CA,102,59,23,10/17/2015,2.0,Went out to lunch with my old roommates and we picked this place. We were sitted very quickly. Unfortunately there menus still had the old ones and didn't have the updated ones  so 2 of us had the right menu and the other was not updated. We ordered drinks and appetizer. I had a strawberry splash really good and my friend had a very overly strong long island. We had calamari it was pretty good  not amazing  but it was good. The side sauces the Marinara was delecious and the white sauce tasted just like tarter sauce not the sauce it was suppose to say. We ordered 2 pizzas one all meat lover and the chicken bacon ranch. The crust was to soft and kinda doughy. The house salad was very good thou. The service was alright  kinda lacked luster. The staff seemed to be all over and it really wasn't that busy. 3 people were just hanging out talking and chat and 3 people where just chatting away in the bathroom too. The restrooms were veru gross. Stalls were missing seat covers and toilet paper in 2 stalls for ladiesroom and 2 restrooms stalls were very dirty. Instead of chatting the staff members in there could off cleaned  instead of talking about universal and how the Halloween horror nights sucked and they're to expensive. To see employees just messing around and it seem to take a bit just to get a water refill and get some chips. Not happy with service and the food was not great at all  just the salad. I will not be going to this BJ again.
Sandy F.,San Fernando  CA,0,17,3,8/8/2014,5.0,So I had dinner w/ mom & sister on this Friday afternoon. We checked in and it took around 5min to be seated. Great!!! The waitress was nice took our drink order so when she came back we were ready to order. Keep in mind we were starving & wanted to order right away. No time for chit-chat  lol! For the appetizer we got the artichoke dip  entres were as follows : grilled chicken pasta (didn't disappoint) turkey club (good) & herb thyme chicken w/veggies (my mom loved it) We waited about 25-30min and still no appetizer  I was beginning to wonder.!! Then here comes our entres. I asked the waiter about the artichoke dip and he stated it was still being delayed because it was made fresh. My thought was.... by getting the appetizer with the entres defeats the purpose of ordering the appetizer. Specially if we were starving.!! Then comes the manager who was the nicest person and apologized for the mix up and offered to comp the appetizer and threw in a free pizookie!!! Bottom line .. I understand mix-ups happen in a busy restaurant & it's up to the managers to keep the customers satisfied. I was very pleased with him because he went above & beyond to fix the problem. I would differently come back and give them another try!!!!  Great customer service on his behalf.
Shan L.,Los Angeles  CA,307,301,1504,7/9/2012,3.0,Came here with the kids after a ROUGH day. We were tired and really hungry. We were greeted by a nice hostess that informed us that if we ate in the bar area we could take advantage of the happy hour menu. Well  we couldn't find sitting in the bar area and had to sit in the main dining area. Our waiter  Jimmy  told us we could we still order happy hour items. So  I got a mini portabello mushroom pizza  chicken won tons  and Thai lettuce wraps. The pizza was really yummy. It was drizzled with balsamic vinegar and the bread was soft and buttery. The won tons were OK. The meat inside was kind of mushy. The lettuce wraps were tangy and refreshing. My son got the lunch portion of chicken tenders and fries even though lunch was over (thanks Jimmy!). He ate it all so he was satisfied. Baby girl got the kids hamburger sliders which looked pretty good and I would've ate myself. Our meal came up to $30 which pretty good. The restaurant itself is very clean and staff is nice.
Linda C.,Diamond Bar  CA,8,41,31,8/22/2015,1.0,WOW!!! Not a good experience. Came in on a Wednesday  before 11:30. 1st no no...they asked how many and I said four and hostess reply was  can you wait? Wait  what? Your restaurant is empty and your servers are standing around talking. Please tell me what I am waiting for  on my limited lunch hour. Or say  it will just be a moment. We sit down and server comes over  we order water and I let her know we have two birthdays and request pizookies  which she writes down. We finally order and two of our party ordered the same burger. At the time if ordering we ask our server to make sure the fries are hot as they always come out cold. 2nd no no...food comes out with cold fries on all plates  wedge and skinny and the two identical burgers  made differently...can you say quality control? When she finally comes to check on us  we let her know about both she brings out one order of hit wedge fries for four people and asks if we want a plate of lettuce...really??? Over an hour later when I flag her down for the check her comment is....no no 3....I haven't placed the order for the pizookies. Really...in over an hour??? I get check  go up to the hostess and ask to speak to the manager...I'm already late for work  so whatever. Guess what the hostess says...yes  no no one  can you wait. Manager  you need training...this meal should have been on the house. He asked what her could do for me and I replied...you don't expect me to pay for this do you??? In the end  he gave 50 percent off. Not going back. Food just adequate and service subpar!!!!!!
Libby R.,Los Angeles  CA,1805,616,646,1/21/2010,3.0,There is truly only one reason to know about BJ's and that is the Pizookie. Period.But I am forced as is my Yelpy duty to actually write a review so I will.The food is decent  the drinks are good and the service is about as quick as a tortoise walking through molasses. But the co-workers consider this the go to spot for Happy Hour on Fridays  so I will partake....but only if I get to order the Pizookie ;)
Christine U.,Arcadia  CA,101,441,57,4/20/2013,3.0,Came here last night with my friend. I order a crispy hamburger and sheOrder a chicken sandwich. I wasn't tonfond of the my meal. It reminded me Of something I can just otder at mcdonald. The only thing I enjoy was the
W. N.,Orange County  CA,34,281,4,6/15/2012,4.0,I am never disappointed with BJ's.What I like about BJ's? No matter where I go...Huntington Beach  Monterey Park or Stockton California  I know I will ALWAYS get a great pizza  very good beer and a big screen TV to watch hockey. And unlike the over priced burger joint Islands  the server can hook you up with the sport you wanna watch on the TV you wanna watch it on.
C W.,Chino  CA,12,178,14,8/6/2014,3.0,WTf is up with the quality of the pizza? It isn't the same as it used to be! I come here only for the wings and the pizzokies. I'd rather go elsewhere for some good pizza.
Tina-Marie L.,La Mirada  CA,584,586,357,1/26/2010,4.0,I come to this BJ's all of the time because it's close to work and close to my mom's house. Sometimes the service is great. Other times you feel like you're on your own. My favorite dish is the Angel Hair Toscana with Chicken. It's obviously angel hair pasta. They toss in olive oil  garlic  sun-dried tomatoes  fire-roasted red peppers  fresh basil  feta cheese  pine nuts  Roma tomatoes and top it with fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley. You also get some garlic bread too. Another thing that's tasty is their Fresh Basil and Sausage pizza. It's a flatbread pizza with mozzarella  Fontina and Parmesan cheeses. They add fresh basil  Roma tomatoes and Italian sausage. I went with friends recently and someone ordered the Potato Chip appetizer. static.px.yelp.com/bphot They were awesome! And that means a lot because I don't even like potato chips.For dessert  you can never go wrong with a pizookie. I hear they have individual ones now. My fave is the white chocolate macademia nut.While I like this BJ's  I also plan accordingly. If I need to be somewhere in an hour or hour and a half  I'm probably not going to put this on my list because of their incosistent service.
Sim G.,Whittier  CA,298,96,79,6/27/2012,4.0,Tatonka Stouts and Pm Porters for days!! yaaaayy. they have a reasonable happy hour. I love this chain just because they make their own beers which range from hefs to deliciously tasty stouts. The food is great no matter what you order!. The staff always seems to be on their toes and very polite. They have big screen tvs to watch all the sports.. yaaa!
Fred P.,El Monte  CA,23,29,64,7/27/2012,2.0,this is the second time that I have come early in the day (4pm). we came to beat the crowd and enjoy ourselves. Ha!It was not crowded and we sat at the bar  It took about 22 min to get a brew. We were given menus and waited about another 20 min to order. After finishing the first round  nobody came by to check on us. Service is Terrible-Terrible-Terrible  our order was incorrect and the server was a girl-with low communication skills as she could not explain anything.We were quite lucky to have a 2nd brew and left immediately. Oh yeah  my friend's pizza was already cold and so were the calamari-it was like the diet calamari order-tiny.I will choose not to return- this place sucks- save your time and money
Kien H.,Alhambra  CA,26,23,5,1/23/2012,2.0,Whatever.Came here with friends for dinner. We were served by this bitch ass waitress with enough attitude to power a whole city. Our asses were barely settled into the chairs before she came back and demanded that we be ready to order. NO. So she huffed and puffed away. My friend got take-out for her boyfriend and requested that it's prepared at the end  but we got that order before any of our food even came out. The waitress barely came by to check up on our table throughout the meal  and we didn't get a single refill on water until we asked a different waiter for it. Then she forgot to give my friend the birthday dessert thing people get here. When we got the take-out order at the end  she gave it to my friend without a bag. REALLY?I hope this silly bitch enjoyed her tip. Can't believe I actually had my birthday here a few years ago. Would not have wanted her to serve 20 people  since she's barely able to handle 3.The food was good  though. I loved my seared ahi salad. Yum.Bad service at this place is apparently no surprise based on previous reviews. Get your shit together.That's all.
Maggie K.,Los Angeles  CA,743,413,35,9/17/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I have an aversion toward BJ's. It's awful food  overpriced drinks  but the layout is nice and it's one of the only decent places in Montebello.But  I will not forget THE PIZOOKIES! Sweet baby Jesus  it is God's given gift to mankind! Such a great indulgence! For sure to cure any heart ache or break up!
Wilson H.,Los Angeles  CA,98,17,,3/30/2014,1.0,"Let\'s keep this short & sweet. Waiter messed up order for my gf. The amount of fries on my plate was minimal. When I made a comment  he said ""that\'s the way it comes."" Funny thing is my son ordered a burger & his fries were normal. So I did what I could. No tip. BJ montebello is no bueno in my book. Here\'s a tip buddy  don\'t brush off your customers when they make a comment about the food/service."
Maria V.,Los Angeles  CA,60,23,8,7/3/2012,4.0,I go here often on dates with the boyfriend and outings with friends. Love the environment and pizza. I've never had a issue with service.I won't have their other food because I don't like it. The pizza is the only thing that's really good here. (Okay  I like their avocado rolls  too!)Their sampler is the best  but I usually just stick to their House Heff or their Blonde... What can I say? I'm a lightweight :).
Heather H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,36,2,7/19/2014,5.0,Love this place! It's a bit pricey for montebello but the happy hour is awesome :) the staff is really friendly too!
Kyle G.,Huntington Beach  CA,10,13,1,7/16/2014,5.0,This BJ'S is really clean and employees are on top of everything. You can never go wrong with there happy hour! The food is always made fresh and delicious 5 stars for me.
Karina M.,Bakersfield  CA,1,16,8,8/8/2014,4.0,Luv! The food is delicious. The chicken pasta with broccoli & the Alfredo always my go to dishes. Pasta perfectly cooked. Same with the chicken. Sometimes i do ask for extra sauce on the pasta with broccoli bcuz in some occasions it does come a little dry but not a big problem just ask for extra sauce. Individual pizza is good. Husband always gets the California chicken sandwich. Yum so good! The wait can be a little too much but i don't complain.
Ji T.,West Covina  CA,231,768,100,6/25/2014,4.0,opens till late  friendly service  its not a place im yearning to go back to but still decent enough for me to consider as an option for late night if i'm in the areai got the prime rib  pretty decent cut for the price  but then again  it could be a lot more expensive and i know iti tried their pizookie.....ice cream on a huge cookie basically....interesting if you love that kind of stuff  i'm not a huge fan....i'll just take ONE PIECE....they have their own in house beer selection on tap with many HH optionsi would definitely consider trying one of their pastas next time though
B M.,Los Angeles  CA,67,108,,6/21/2012,4.0,I seriously can't understand all the bad reviews. Everytime i come here the service is great  and the food is good. Yes this location is always packed for dinner  and there is usually a 30 minute wait.For the most part I always order the pizza. Specifically the Portobello mushroom. I love me some mushrooms! Balsamic vinaigrette  marinated oven roasted mushrooms  caramelized onions  fresh thyme  parsley  Fontina cheese and balsamic glaze. Amazing! I always request to add some jalapenos on it  to give it a little kick. The pastas and burgers are never a let down either. Pretty good beer selection. Options from German Kolsch  to Russian stout. But I always stick to my Stella. Big screen TV's at every angle so you never miss a milisecond of any game.If you are impatient  then you might want to go to different location. The fact that this BJ's is at a mall  is the reason it is always jam packed  thus the waiter's will be a tad bit slower.If not  Im sure you'll enjoy it here  just as I always do.
Annette M.,Santa Fe Springs  CA,0,38,11,7/12/2015,3.0,I love BJ'S food but service today was so bad I don't think I'll be coming back to Montebello location for a while. We ordered calamari and it seems the portions for alot smaller and for the same price. I wasn't to pleased today.
Loretta C.,Los Angeles  CA,3498,950,21263,10/16/2010,4.0,This is a nice sit-down place for both couples and families  and located within the Towne Center Mall They had lots of TV screens throughout the restaurant  with a main screen at the bar showing what's on the other 8 TV screens  all showing football games heh.The service is great and the waiters constantly checked in on us. We ordered mozzarella sticks and two small pizzas; the Great White and the Southwestern. They took a while to make the pizzas but when they came out  both were amazing and cheesy!
Jorge C.,Pico Rivera  CA,4,16,2,7/23/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I dont know what was worst the bad attitude from the hostess..(not a single welcome or smile).or being left alone for 25 minutes with no server.....we ordered a pizza no plates on my table...I saw the server with my food waiting for the thing that is used to hold the pizza....no refills....but when jessica took over....we had a different experience. ...she was awesome. ...made us forget the bad service...a big shout out for u jessica...
Frank R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,,9/10/2015,1.0,I honestly do not write reviews on yelp but I just felt I had to comment on poor customer service. I ordered two items  a sandwich and a pizza. An hour to get my food but it was busy no biggie. My pizza arrives first and the server tells me we put the wrong toppings on your pizza but keep this one while we bring yours out. Then comes my sandwich  I ordered it with out garlic aioli mayo. I'm not one to complain though I just politely asked if I can get one without it. From that point on the servers attitude changed. They brought my pizza out and it was still wrong I ordered it with roasted red peppers and they literally just sprinkled regular green bell peppers on top. I didn't care though. What was the real issue and most upsetting was that after I requested the bill  my sever tried to come and give us a lecture on what an aioli is and that it's not mayo. I am in the restaurant business myself  I know what an aioli is but I'm going on how it's Written ON THE MENU there's no need to try to lecture my table  and she literally says well now you know. I'm receiving attitude for the restaurants mistake when I did not even complain. Upsetting never coming here again.
Cameron P.,Highland  CA,50,51,2,4/24/2012,3.0,They tried seating me by the front door in a huge booth for families when it was just two people. So I'll take off a star.The bartenders were nice though. I love their buffalo pizza and avacado deep fried egg roles...yum!
Christopher A.,Montebello  CA,43,10,3,4/2/2014,5.0,Happy hour specials are pretty bomb. Can't go wrong with any of their flatbread pizzas and I've never tried a brew I didn't like their. Also  they have a very friendly staff of waiters. Usually not too crowded except on game days
Elisa D.,Pico Rivera  CA,3,17,8,7/7/2014,2.0,Decent. The whole experience was just weird. Had to ask for silverware. Strawberry lemonade was nasty. The pasta and pizza were ehh  mediocre. The only thing I loved were the mozzarella sticks.
Erika R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,26,5,3/30/2014,5.0,I've avoided BJ's since the last experience was not very good (about a year ago  the waiter kept forgetting about us)  but decided that a year might be enough for change  and boy was I right. The service was great! We had a very nice waitress (Raquel I believe was her name). I tried one of their new salads as an appetizer (arugula and bean)  and it was very refreshing. I also tried the chipotle-cherry glazed salmon and have found my new favorite dish  it was very delicious!! Their alcoholic beverage selection is great. I opted for the pear cider; small alcohol content  without the strong beer or sweet fruity drink taste.
Jenay M.,Alhambra  CA,37,26,3,7/12/2012,2.0,"Typical ""American"" style food. Much like Applebee\'s  Denny\'s  and any other restaurant chain. But this particular BJ\'s has a very RUDE staff. I have been here at least 3 times  and the staff here always seem so rushed and give you that ""GET YOU IN  GET YOU OUT"" feeling. The BJ\'s in West Covina is much more mellow for some reason. Much better vibe  nicer staff  and you dont have to seek out your waiter to help you with anything because they are usually visible when you need something. I\'m done with the bastard staff at Montebello."
Perla G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,5/2/2016,1.0,Now  I've been here before and never had this problem but I was very disappointed this last time I was here. I came here during your dinner rush recently and didn't even stay 10 minutes because the hostess is by far one of the worst hostesses I've ever encountered. She barely looked at me while I stood there and seemed to be extremely upset and annoyed to be there but the second a coworker would come around she was all smiles. I don't understand why she'd be positioned to greet your guests with such a nasty attitude. All she said with a monotone was how many before she brushed us off and said gimme 10 minutes. Maybe you can find a position for her in the back of house. She was about 5'5 glasses  dark hair  dark brown skin when I asked for her name she rolled her eyes. No I'm not lying she rolled her god damn eyes like if I was asking to split a $10 check 17 different ways. She replied in a very annoyed tone and said her name was Marlene. Sweetheart  you get paid to be a hostess  do your job or quit. This is a business  a corporate company you work for...get it together or ask for a different position. The food isn't THAT good for us to be subjected to such horrible service.
Courtney J.,Walnut  CA,7,301,693,11/2/2011,1.0,"Nice beer selection...Too bad  bartender name Brittany is lousy in her job!!All she cares are fast order  fast re-order  fast ""Here is your Bill"".The worse bartender ever."
Maria A.,Washington  DC,389,287,7,12/28/2011,3.0,The ONLY place to hang out in Montebello after hours.Be prepared to see your elementary school enemy  your middle school crush  and your high school nemesis at this location if you lived around Montebello.So awkward.Anyway... service ranges from absolutely excellent (there is this one guy some nights that is just SO happy to serve you  and SO excited about the menu and you and life.) And there's this one girl at night who might as well be throwing your plates to you from a distance as she stares you down.Food is good  thankfully.I'm very rarely disappointed by a meal I order. Pizza is nice and carby  appetizers are nice and greasy  just what I'm looking for usually.The star of the night is always the pizzookie. I am ashamed to admit I visit this BJs WAY more than anyone should. But that's what you gotta do when you live in Montebello. -___-
Amy R.,East Los Angeles  CA,6,60,10,5/18/2014,5.0,Love it. Hubby and I always go for special occasions..we love the steak and fettuccine Alfredo with chicken yummy.. Love the flatbread margarita fresca... The strawberry lemonade is my favorite. Customer service is pretty good. Thanks guys.
Kaylin O.,Los Angeles  CA,219,887,306,11/13/2009,4.0,It was packed for a Thursday night. We decided to try some of their new items on the menu: bbq pulled pork sliders  bbq chicken sliders  fried calamari  caesar salad with cajun shrimps  and the pizookie trio.I really like the bbq pulled sliders and the coleslaw that accompanies it. The bbq chicken sliders were good too. I didn't get to try the fried calamari. After having caesar salad at morton's  parkway grill  and other fine restaurants  this salad was horrible. Too salty and the cajun shrimp makes it even worse. Pizookie trio was good but I'd rather stick to my favorite white chocolate macadamia one.Service was good.
Michelle C.,Los Angeles  CA,1,11,2,1/23/2014,1.0,Probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while. Hostesses at the front didn't even bother to greet us when we entered inside. We asked for a booth  and the hostess seated other guests before us (even though we arrived before). Once seated  our server took nearly 20 minutes to finally take our order. To top it off  our food came out cold and nearly burnt. So unprofessional.
Amber B.,La Mirada  CA,0,7,,6/25/2014,1.0,I love coming here. The atmosphere is great. The beers are tasty. The only thing that has made me upset  is the steak. I've tried ordering the steak about 3 the different times and every time  the steak is cooked wrong. I ask for med-rare and it was practically raw. I had them recook it to med-well and it was still too raw. Today is my fourth time ordering steak. I asked for med-well.. they gave me (and im not exaggerating) the driest steak I've ever gotten from a restaurant. I love steak  but I couldn't even eat this one. So if you decide to visit this restaurant (at least at this location) DO NOT ORDER STEAK.. you won't be pleased.
AG G.,Buena Park  CA,0,18,16,9/29/2014,1.0,Live near the mall my brother and I went in on a Saturday for dinner. They sat us  we got menus waited 1/2 hour. we decided to leave.  Never again will I return to this specific location again.
Victor Q.,Covina  CA,1,28,,4/27/2013,2.0,I normally have had great experiences at most Bjs restaurants.... but.... theres always one stragler..and Montebello Bjs is that straggler. The servers have this attitude problem..and when i summoned the manager... the apple didnt fall too far from the tree. I can see where they get it from. so i ended up calling corporate. dont bother with this one... it just ruins your opinion of a good Brand .
Cesar D.,Montebello  CA,26,47,19,10/21/2013,3.0,Busy spot on Sundays during NFL season. Not a bad place to catch a game if you can get a table or a seat at the bar.
Jair F.,Huntington Park  CA,7,8,,7/14/2014,5.0,Great service. Great food. Clean environment. Really enjoyed my experience. We were seated right away and our server didn't hesitate to bring us water right away while we decided on drinks and gave us enough time to think about what we want to eat without being pushy. Didn't have to wait long for our food either. Very good service!
Evan R.,La Puente  CA,9,20,13,5/14/2014,3.0,This place is very average  the location isn't great either. I've been to better BJs restaurants. It seems like I was given a much smaller portion of food then I've received before. I don't go to BJs every weekend but I've been there enough to remember the normal size of the entree I get. The balsamic glazed chicken was a very small portion. It was a little disappointing because I was looking forward to my meal  and 8 bites later it was gone.. Maybe I'll have better luck at a different BJs. Our waitress was a Debbie-downer also  overall a very average night.
Jeannette N.,Montebello  CA,0,7,1,10/2/2014,1.0,If you want to be ignored? This is the place. Terrible service. The girl in the front with the computer whos one job is to write people down didnt write us down. When we saw people pass us she said someone else went in as us. Really? Maybe it was because she looked down at her list and didnt write us down. Were not going back.
Luna M.,Los Angeles  CA,26,26,6,3/19/2014,5.0,My boyfriend and I come here very oftenly. We live less than 5 minutes away. It is a nice place. It has big selection of everything ! We also do take outs too! It is a nice place to go and just sit around and eat or do take outs if you don't feel like cooking. :)
Mimi B.,Valencia  CA,0,3,1,4/1/2016,1.0,Went here on Wedsday for dinner because were staying at the Hotel across the street. Hostess said 15 min  we were seated in 5. Hence  the 1 star. Server came up to take a drink order. 2 sodas and a kids milk. He disappeared for a long time and finally came back to take our order. He brought the sodas and a GIANT cup instead of a kids cup  which is a bummer since my kiddo couldn't even hold the cup by herself. We ordered the santa fe roll appetizer  shrimp & asparagus pasta  and the triple decker sandwich. Plus  a kids mac & cheese & potato wedges. He didn't come back to refill sodas at all. NO appetizer came out  but the food did. So we mention to him we're missing an appetizer. He didn't seem to concerned  and said he'd go check on it. A few minutes later ANOTHER server ended up bring it out after we started eating our entrees  with no apology or anything. Our server never apologized for the mess up either. As far as the food  the Eggrolls were bland and tiny  the pasta sauce tasted like something poured from a can  and the sandwich was very plain. I didn't bother to taste my kids mac & cheese but I can tell you the potato wedges were also quite flavorless. When we asked for the check he brought it  then disappeared for a long time before coming back to take payment. We literally waited for him to bring our card back while he was at the table behind us flirting with a group of young girls for a minimum of 5 minutes. All in all  the service was atrocious  the food sucked  and I would never come back. Dear Management: DO NOT HIRE KIDS WHO DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR PATRONS. Had the service been better  I would have overlooked the food sucking and rated this place better. I'll stick to the BJs by my house which actually seasons their food  and has nicer servers who are smart enough to bring a toddler a childs cup and bring out an appetizer BEFORE the entrees.
Wendy L.,Rosemead  CA,87,30,24,1/6/2014,3.0,The girl that was serving my friend and I was pretty nice  but still the service was just awful. My pizza took a really long time to come out  also it came out kinda warm  I'm guessing it was sitting there for a while before anyone had brought it to me. They didn't gave us any plates to feed ourselves either. My pizookie took 20 minutes to come out. The cookie was kinda warm too  it wasn't hot like it should be. Service sucks at night.
lester p.,South El Monte  CA,453,142,127,5/31/2011,4.0,This is one of the smaller BJ's I've been to. But the staff here is friendly and the hostesses were welcoming. I haven't had to wait long for a table ever last couple of times I've been here. The food here is cooked to perfection. I haven't had any complaints about my food. I happened to sit at the bar tonight. It was a sunday evening and it wasnt all that busy. Had a few drinks  watched some sports sports and munched on some appetizers.  service was pompt and the spinach and artichoke dip was good.
Karla G.,Hacienda Heights  CA,1,16,1,10/14/2014,2.0,Super disappointed with this BJ's. I have a BJ's closer to home but since this one is located in the mall  I like to bring my mom for lunch and do some shopping. Lunch hour is our favorite  I completely understand when it's a full house  people coming in on their lunch break but I'm not exactly sure if they were under staff but being a frequent customer I noticed a lot of new hires and not one person seemed to know how to balance themselves. The host in front was too busy talking about her personal life with her co worker  my mom handed her our BJ's member card and gave us a poker face and told us to hand it to the waiter. Our waitress was alright  not good not bad. They brought my moms soup and forgot about mine. Not once did they come to us asking if we were fine  seemed like not only our table but the ones around us needed to wave our hand just to get a waiters attention. It took a lot for us not to get up and leave  as we watched others do so. Finally our food arrived and it looked half assed. At this point I just want the check  unfortunately that took over 20mins to get. To only person who made eye contact was the bus boy. After we were handed the check  no one bothered to pick it up  we walked to the front and the girl sent us back to the table. I wanted to pay with my card but I got so impatient I used cash and left it on the table. The location itself is alright  I like the one better by my house but the service here really failed me today.
Priscilla R.,Monterey Park  CA,0,3,,5/9/2015,1.0,This used to be the place we could count on for a good burger  pizza and steak  but this last meal was horrible. My daughters steak was cooked super well done when I requested medium  my sandwich had a strong chemical taste on the grilled bread and the rest of the food we had was horrible. I think the only thing we enjoyed were the skinny fries. $100 worth of food down the drain. Definitely won't be coming back. Pretty sad
Gloria S.,Los Angeles  CA,43,13,,4/11/2014,5.0,I needed to go to the mall and had dinner first at BJ's Restaurant. Our server  Gabriel  was awesome. I am one of those that has to have everything right. If it's iced tea  it has to come with a slice of lemon.  I ordered a salad and my friend had the fish and chips. We also had the avocado rolls for appetizer and those were the best. Our dinner was perfect. Gabriel made sure we were happy and had all that we need for a nice dinner.  I usually get the Ahi tuna salad and it's always made just right. I've been here alot and this place  although sometimes real busy  offers great customer service and good food. I will be back soon.
Dv T.,Los Angeles  CA,1,3,,12/10/2013,1.0,The food is always good at bj's but the customer service is horrible !!!! Even the manager (a girl ) was super rude. We got there at 11 pm and they close at 12   around 11:40 they turned on the lights & turned off the music & we fell like we were in the cafeteria . The server kept on rolling her eyes . Just bad service .
Karen Y.,Montebello  CA,185,559,329,9/24/2011,3.0,This Bj's is small and located in the mall. Don't even think of going on a Friday or Saturday night cause it's at least an hour wait. Probably more.The food at this location is ok. The avocado eggrolls come with this way too sweet dip. I'd suggest light ranch instead. The new portobello pizza wasn't good at all surprisingly. They usually do good with their pizzas but this had no flavor and was dry. The pizookies here are usually a little under done. I like my cookies a bit more cooked. You can get half and half flavors on your pizookie too.
Jay H.,Phoenix  AZ,157,82,,3/11/2014,5.0,Came Here a bit late around 10z happy hour starts after 10 on weekdays and closes at 12. Great selections  had the Stella and avocado slider snacks was amazing . Freely staff working here and accident all major cards. It is located inside the Montebello mall.
Jenny C.,Alhambra  CA,144,124,,1/1/2012,3.0,before going any further  just so all of your guys know  a 3 star is NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL.the overall experience was great.the service was good  slightly slow on bringing us the drinks  but still nice and helpful.the food was GOOD. at first i thought it was going to be one of those over priced  small portion  rude fancy restaurants  but their food was good and is a good portion for the price you pay. friends ordered the spaghetti and a burger  both are delicious. i ordered a chicken a la fresca  which was decent  good for girls if you're into that health stuff. the chicken was a little too burnt for my taste. the mood of the restaurant is good  the lights are dim but you can still see your food. there's a bar section if you are interested in watching the sports  but still very classy.i would go back again because all the food seem pretty good.
Ashita K.,Glendora  CA,98,98,109,9/24/2013,2.0,This review is about their customer service  not their food. I'm giving them two stars only because of the food. Otherwise this review would have 0 stars. We went to this BJ's a while ago when they had the 2 for 20 deal (that deal is back now). We were immediately seated so we were really happy to start off with. Who gets seated right away in a BJ's on the weekend  right? But we should have known better than to get all excited because we didn't have to wait. After being seated  we had to wait a good 20 mins for our server. And we could see her going back and forth to the table right across us. She finally came and we gave her our order right away and told her we were going for the 2 for 20 deal. Then a good 30 mins passed before our soups showed up. Now here's the thing.....we barely put our spoons in the soups and this guy showed up with our pizza. I'm sorry  but I don't like eating cold pizza. I would like to have enough time to finish my soup. Anyway  we took a look at the pizza and saw the pineapple was missing. The server came along and we told her the pizza didn't have pineapple. She said she could bring it on the side! Who eats pineapple like that? A side of jalapeos  I understand  but pineapple? We told her it was okay and that we don't need it on the side. We finished eating and then played the waiting game again. It took her 40 mins to show up at our table. Till then  the server helping the table next to us got our ranch  chilli peppers  and water. Our server showed up and we ordered our dessert. We got done with that and we waited again. After 20 mins  she came with our bill. How much was the bill? 46 dollars. This time I didn't even bother waiting for her. I just called the other server and told her we had ordered the 2 for 20 deal. She apologized and fixed our bill. Right then  our server showed up and I told the other server I would rather tip her than our server. And I did. My boyfriend even sent BJ's an email. But they don't care! Pathetic customer service. And it's only at this one that we always get bad servers. Go to West Covina. They have much better customer service there!
Leslie P.,Whittier  CA,0,5,,10/15/2015,2.0,"TOOK US FOREVER TO GET A TABLE HERE. Me and my friends came last week to celebrate my friends birthday. They told us 20 mins. At 30 MINUTES I go up and ask the women how much longer it would take  she was kind rude and just looked up and told me ""you\'re number 13 on the list of 45 people"" ummm really?? Thanks for the help lady. At 45 MINUTES  servers came up to us and gave us a slice a pizza. Then finally at 55 MINUTES! They gave us a table. Our waitress was nice  but she had to leave and we were left with some guy. HE WAS SO RUDE!! On my menu it that my meal came with 2 pieces of chicken. I\'m not complaining or anything but if it say 2 then why did I only get 1. I mean I am paying for 2 right? I asked the waiter and he so smart with me and told me if I wanted to I can pay extra? And he gave me an a face when I asked him if the lunch special prices were the same at dinner time. The only reason why it\'s not a 1 start review is because they did give my friend a free small desert because it was her birthday."
Linda T.,Monterey Park  CA,0,28,11,3/4/2014,3.0,Service is rather slow.. Waited about 20Mins to be seated when restaurant looks empty... Whatever.. We did the wait.We ordered a pizza that's supposedly Chicago style but it's definetly not! It's more like Pizza Hut pan pizza. Chicago pizza is usually dense and full of toppings. The pizza served is airy and light on the toppings. We ordered a large pizza  Pizzokie  glass of beer  and kids chicken tender meal. $55.00 including tip. Better off ordering piZZA Hut.
Marco G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,11/17/2014,1.0,Never in my life have I waited so long to the point where I decide to leave. I guess there's always a first time for everything. Got sat pretty quick but not one server seemed to acknowledge us even as they passed right by our table.
Anthony U.,Montebello  CA,162,165,41,2/21/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I went to BJ's with a friend just to get out for an hour or two and have a few drinks. Not only was it freezing outside but of course was packed with people inside. This is one reason more stars don't come their way. I don't even know why they put one here in Montebello to begin with but since it is they do I have to admit keep it clean and well maintained.......and there was no gas leak this time.The wait to be seated was not that long only a few minutes or so. We ordered our drinks and they also arrived promptly. I got the jaramiah red and my friend got a tequila sunrise. He wanted something to munch on with the drinks so I suggested the chicken potstickers and he sounded like he was game so he ordered them and he was pleasently surprised at how good they were.The waiter came back and we ordered another drink each. The waiter was cool and gave him his second sunrise in a huge glass compared to the first one he brought and I was wondering where my larger beer was...Oh well I wasn't paying so I didn't really care a free buzz is a free buzz.
Esme N.,Los Angeles  CA,28,4,3,6/16/2014,2.0,The service was not good at all. Our waitress had a very dry attitude which made my group and I feel very uncomfortable. They brought our food out and after that she was no where to be seen for over an hour. It frustrated us so much that the manager came out to take our order. If she went to take her lunch or take a break she should have at least had another waiter to help.Then when she came back out to help she seemed bothered that she had to come back to help us. We weren't rude to her so we did not understand why her attitude was so sour. The food was okay. The AC was a little to high for our liking. Overall not the best dining experience. Maybe its just this location or just the BJS restaurant.
Honest L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,10/29/2013,1.0,This place is the worst Restaurant I have been to in a while. The service is horrible  I waited 15 min just for the server to ask us what we wanted to drink  an extra 15 to take our orders and 20 min to deliver a salad that was dry with rotting leaves. DISGUSTING!!!! When I made the server aware of the horrible salad she  with an attitude responded I'll get another one. Furious  I just left after more than an hr waiting on our food. This place needs to get shut down  how in the world are they still in business!
Dr K.,Rosemead  CA,180,661,248,5/6/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Loud  so very loud.On a random note: Most of the servers look good but walking around I notice most people in here are pretty fat. Probably cause the 700 cal salad is one of the lower calorie meals here.
Ayami H.,Orange County  CA,658,544,746,5/31/2009,4.0,i like this location!! less crowded than the monrovia or brea locations... i've only had to wait one time in the many times i've been here and that was because it was a friday night. i almost always get the chinese chicken salad (that's not what its called but thats what it is). cabbage  some kind of nappa looking leaves  wonton crunchies  green onions  tangerines and slices of chicken on top. i've been asking for the dressing on the side now since BJ's doesnt provide nutrional info on their meals...you need to eat good to be bad with the pazookies right!?eh... food is good and the service is good. if i have a problem  ive always had friendly help from the workers there. tried the thai shrimp wrap today  it was pretty good considering i dont like shrimp. i just put it aside and ate the rest :)
Jenny P.,Alhambra  CA,7,105,5,2/21/2014,3.0,This BJ's gets very packed as you would imagine being attached to a mall  but if you don't mind a little wait for both a table and then food  it's what you'd expect for a normal BJ's restaurant. We go here because the selection of different foods is very broad.
Roni R.,Los Angeles  CA,159,369,,1/23/2012,4.0,I love the bread they bring out. I've been loving their light menu -- the tilapia is fabu as is the chicken with rice and salad. SO GOOD. Oh  I also love their lunch specials and you really can't go wrong w/a cup of clam chowder with sandwich and fries. I mean -- you lose track of your calorie count but oh so good!!! The service is hit and miss depending on the waiter so that would be my only minus. OH  and thei light beer is horrible! Really bad. Don't order it. It was my fault for ordering light beer to begin with ... I'm just a hopeful romantic when it comes to beer  though.
Jonny R.,Monterey Park  CA,36,132,,2/9/2015,1.0,if you're into slooowww dining  and hostesses that act like you're bothering them when you check in  then this is the place for you...not a fan because an average dinner for 3 of us went over 2 hours...that's including the debacle that was my daughters steak which had to be sent back for sitting too long in the broiler...bar scene looked fun
Diana L.,Pasadena  CA,48,148,69,2/8/2012,4.0,I had the Enlightened Barbacoa Chicken Tacos. It was full of flavor and only for $5.95! Their service is really sloooooooooooow  especially during lunch hour even when there wasn't a lot of people! Minus 1 star.
Joel T.,Los Angeles  CA,124,55,40,1/20/2014,5.0,Food and Service is always good here. Usually best time to go is during happy hour. I woudl reccomend the Mini meatball pizza  wings are off the chain good  sliders are excellent and avocado egg rolls. Could also live off the Bj's Heff and the strawberry donut desert.
Rony B.,Los Angeles  CA,5,83,25,2/13/2011,5.0,Start with a Brewhouse Blonde followed by a Jeremiah Red and then Fish n chips...It hits the spot!Avocado rolls are the best appetizers!
Daniel B.,Whittier  CA,2,7,1,4/6/2015,4.0,We visited on Sat 4/4/15. By far it was the best service we have received from anyone anywhere in a long time. Our server was Crystal and she was on top of it. She took our drink order  had the presence of mind to ask if we wanted her to bring out the kids food when ready ahead of our food  she kept our drinks refilled and checked on us just enough. I had a beef dip sandwich with horseradish. It absolutely hit the spot. My wife had a salad that she enjoyed. We were lucky enough to have an isolated booth that kept the noise level down and let us drop the guard on our kids. It was well worth the trip.
Joss A.,Pico Rivera  CA,218,5,4,12/31/2012,4.0,First time in this BJ's and I have to tell you. It was a great experience. Service was great and fast !!!!
Amanda M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,33,,9/23/2013,5.0,I usually come to this BJ's on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. There's never too long of a wait time and plenty of seating at the bar  unless of course there is a popular game on. There's not one thing I don't like on the menu. It's very extensive but the food always tastes great. Usually a manger will walk by and make sure everything is running smoothly. There have been a few times they either forgot a dish or some other mistake happens on a busy day but I'm not really one to complain or make a scene. They're very nice and apologetic. You may even get a freebie or two!The main reason why I'm writing this review is for JAMES! He's always there when my boyfriend and I visit on weekends. We always try to sit in his section because he has the best attitude I've ever seen in a waiter! There's not a day where this guy seems like he's having a tough day and is upset. He's very attentive especially on busy days  not to mention hilarious! I always leave notes on our receipt hoping he'll read it because we really do appreciate his great service. There need to be more people like James in this world!
Aldo R.,El Monte  CA,121,41,7,12/8/2011,3.0,Like any other BJ's  pretty good bar and food.The only down side is the pasta  every time that I have being there the Fetuccinni Alfredo has been horrible  always under cooked  not aldente  just under cooked  stay away from it.
Juliana Y.,Pasadena  CA,371,419,1835,1/6/2014,1.0,been here a few times and it was xmas eve so i already expected poor service which is not a big deal for me.. i get it.. it's xmas eve they dont wanna over staff and hold them from their family gatherings.. surprisingly there were more people there than expected.. their system kept on crashing.. my order took a long time.. the food was still pretty good except for my salad which was overly dressed.. had to send it back.. the soup and bread bowl was good.. at the end when the bill came they had forgotten to take off the salad.. and i was told that the system was down so i might not be able to use my g/c.. also they did the calculations manually since the system was down.. and over charged me.. b/c once the system was up..my total was different.. is there something wrong there??? -_-
Galen C.,Chino Hills  CA,0,14,6,2/21/2015,1.0,Very mismanaged. The hostess made us wait in the lobby for no reason! Terrible service.
Dana T.,Daly City  CA,714,16,,1/23/2012,2.0,I've been to a lot of BJ's and have always been treated with great service  but this restaurant came up short in the service department. It was not a great experience.The hostess wasn't very professional. It seemed like she was new and didn't know what to say  nor give a very good seating selection when there were clearly many other open tables that were much better than the corner we got. It felt like she seated us for the convenience of the waitress  who was also waiting on the three tables directly next to us.The waitress took way too long to get us water while we needed to buy time to figure out what to eat. It felt like a 5-10 minute wait for her to come back with our drinks and take our order. She didn't even serve us our food  instead a food server came out with our dishes.The food was pretty good  though.I noticed most of the workers were busy with their own side conversations and seemed like they didn't really enjoy working there.I like going to BJ's for the great dining experience and atmosphere  especially considering the $$ price tag you pay for most of the food. Maybe I was spoiled by other BJ's with their great customer service (Chino Hills and Irvine)  but this BJ's is definitely the runt of the litter.
G D.,Beverly Hills  CA,2,14,,2/17/2015,4.0,"While this isn\'t the first time I\'ve been to this location  I wanted to give my compliments to the manager.To set the scene  I went with my girlfriend\'s family to eat and we were a big party. It was about 6 pm and the place was pretty busy. Waitress came and took our order. Wait time for food was longer than normal  but acceptable. I ordered a buffalo burger off of the ""healthy"" menu choices  medium rare. I was aiming to not totally pig out tonight. Anyway  the food came out  I cut my burger in half  and took a couple of bites. It was rare at best  but I think it was slightly raw. I flag the waitress down and tell her about it. She says I can have it cooked more or have it remade. She also suggested upping the temperature to medium. I thought remaking as medium was fine and she takes my food back. While waiting manager (I think his name is Chris  but not 100% since it was pretty loud) comes by  apologizes for under cooked burger  and offers a soup or salad to tide me over. I decline because I didn\'t want to over eat. Second burger comes out and I cut it down the middle. It\'s even MORE under cooked and looks raw in the middle. My girlfriend brought a waiter (not the one serving our table) and sends the burger back. Manager comes back and apologizes again. I ask him for a menu so I can order something else (grilled turkey and ham sandwich). He brings my food out and apologizes again. About half way through me eating  manager comes back to check up on me. He offers dessert to the table. I tell him others have already ordered a pizookie and he says he\'ll make it so we can all share it. I believe it was also comped. The pizookie was upgraded to the large size and it was half white chocolate and half regular chocolate.Don\'t know if anyone from BJ\'s will read this but I wanted to give credit to the manager for handling the situation professionally and quickly. I can\'t thank the manager enough as not all mangers were as nice as him. I also hope he was able to actually see the second under cooked burger I got. The cooks probably need to cook the buffalo burgers on a part of the grill that isn\'t quite as hot."
Jason F.,Aliso Viejo  CA,380,792,826,10/1/2011,2.0,Came here for happy hour around 3pm. Drinks were weak and watered down. Service was okay. Nothing to rave about.
Joanne T.,Alhambra  CA,25,157,,12/12/2011,4.0,Good place for family and friend gatherings. Nice big TV in front of the bar. Plenty of seating deep within the restaurant. Service is standard and they usually come around to check on you. Food comes out a bit slow  but that's what the TV is for  I guess. I liked the sliders  minestrone soup (although a bit salty when I had it the second time around)  asian chicken salad  and the pizookie! You have to order the pizookie if you come! It's simple  choose your cookie dough and top with ice cream. When I used to eat chocolate  I luved the warm white chunk mac nut with vanilla ice cream. It was sooo delicious! This particular location is quite busy at night  but it's within a mall  so there's plenty of parking. Not too fond of the crowd though  but sometimes you just have to tough it out especially if you're craving some pizookie!
Ashley V.,Montebello  CA,66,4,,3/14/2014,2.0,I came to eat here with two of my friends and the waitress brought out our drinks 10 minutes after we had ordered them. They also did not bring out a pizza that we had ordered over an hour ago and when we spoke to the supervisor he didn't do anything besides offer to take it off our bill. This was the worst service I have ever gotten here and hope no one has the same experience
Juan B.,South El Monte  CA,19,9,8,5/19/2013,1.0,The food was good. The service was mediocre. They gave us dirty looking silverware twice. I had to get ice out of my water to clean the silverware. Not one server or bus boy had the presence in mind to pick up the pile of dirty silverware from our table. Even tho this BJ's is by far closer to where I live  I would not go back to this one. I would go to Arcadia or West Covina instead.
Rome T.,Rowland Heights  CA,209,23,33,1/31/2012,4.0,"Server oh Server John (416 G)  you DA man! You\'ve saved BJ\'s from a terrible review today because of your excellent customer service. If every worker is as easy going as you are  then they place would be screaming of laughers! Not to also mention  your ""glass of water"" always being half plus full  lightening fast speedy service! Literally  eat bite I take into my awesome buffalo chicken pizza lightly drizzled with ranch  there\'s John right beside us asking if everything is okay. Why this BJ\'s location suffered from 1 star shy away of perfection was due to the waiting time and the poor front desk service. It took us nearly an hour to be seated when we got there around 10PM and they close at 1AM. The front desk personnel appeared to had a much more greater time ignoring us and smoking/joking. Then again  we came in with a stampede of 8 people vs. the normally 3 - 5 people party that simply walks on through the entrance and on to their non-reserved seats.For BJ\'s: Keep in mind that your estabishment have starving people that needs assist ASAP!"
Jackie D.,El Monte  CA,14,16,8,10/8/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Love this place! Pizza is great  great variety in beer! Great ambiance never too crowded and all the hostess and waiters are really nice! :) I love it cuz I always get my orders pretty fast!! And last but not least it's right up the street from my house so anytime I jst feel like having a beer just go up the street lol...
Ariel M.,Huntington Park  CA,330,443,198,3/28/2011,3.0,Packed  as always but I love to come to this particular location with my girls to drink and chat it up. The last time I came with my friends  the waitress rushed us and that wasn't a customary tactic of a BJ's waitress so I'm not dinging them for that  but if it happens again  I'm definitely updating my review with a lower grade.I like the TV's  the appetizers  and the beer. And when I come with my gal pals  I like it even more.The nachos are bomb diggity! I really like their tomato soup too. The best alcohol prices are during happy hour and their house brews.Large beer selection and the staff know how to pair the beers for the most part. Stay away during a Lake Show or Dodger game because people hoard their tables and bar stools and you'll never get a seat.Also  phone ahead to sign in save time waiting!
Eugene G.,Pasadena  CA,15,177,,3/25/2011,2.0,"BJs use to be one of my favorite restaurants. You would get a pretty good pint of beer and a tasty slice of deep dish pizza. Now it seems that things are going down hill. Came here and ordered a potato skin appetizer and never got it. I must have been forgotten in the sea of customers. Then ordered a porter (beer) and it just does not taste as good as it use to. I remember really enjoying the porter here. Is quality control going down hill or are they using cheaper ingredients.... or better yet is there a new brewer who isn\'t doing a good job? Probably a combo of both.The pizza was ""meh"" I remember really enjoying it but now its just forgettable and I\'ll probably look elsewhere for a decent deep dish pizza. Girlfriend ordered jambalaya and it was not very good at all. I could have made a better version at home with simpler ingredients  our version was pretty bad  not authentic and just a weird combination of flavors and ingredients. Such a disappointment."
Ami S.,Walnut  CA,0,12,7,3/22/2015,5.0,Can never go wrong here  great food  good selection of beer. Friendly service  always go there for avocado eggrolls and Pazookie.
Vanessa G.,Los Angeles  CA,179,31,21,2/28/2012,5.0,Hef and appetizers ;) Oh and I made my own pizza combo and put Bacon green bell peppers onions tomatoes cheese and pepperoni. We ordered a medium pizza and took a slice home which was just as good the next day re-heated in the toaster oven and even crispier than the day before.Our waiters were both crazy and nice and kept it real about the menu on which foods were just OK and which were to die for!Next time trying the mac and cheese just because of how he described it!Bacon baked on top=Heaven teehee!My boyfriend and I LOVED the house Heff's so much we got two each and walked out feeling pretty buzzed nice and strong beers my favorite!Some girls next to us were celebrating their Bday and got a nice big pizzookie desert for free I'm taking my boyfriend back here for his Bday next week to get him one too!This place is excellent for dining with friends  a date  or to watch games because the atmosphere is fun loud and has tons of TV's to watch games ect.
Eddie C.,Downey  CA,12,186,241,11/17/2013,1.0,I hope this BJs burns to the ground! It was horrible! Pretty slow for a Sunday night and it took about 40-60 minutes from the time we ordered our food to get the food. Our original waiter left without saying anything. The food sucked. My medium-well steak had too much pink. I send it back and it came back with a bit of char on the outside but still just as pink on the inside. My dad's pizza was sad. It looked like bread and cheese. Never again coming to this place!
Janie T.,Montebello  CA,57,81,195,10/10/2011,3.0,went here for a late dinner on Saturday night after the Tiesto concert.*clam chowder- yummy! tho it was a bit salter than normal but nonetheless it was still good.grilled pork chops- two pieces of grilled pork chops on a bed of apple sauce with a side of green beans and a side of cheddar mash. * apple sauce- I didn't care too much for it  probably better to eat by itself as a desert after you are finished with the dish than eating it with the pork chops. * pork chops- The first piece of was good  juicy and perfectly cook. Tho the 2nd piece was a bit on the dryer side. Perfectly seasoned. *mash- tasted like any other mash I've ever had* green beans- steamed and not seasoned. I love veggies so this was tasty even without salt lol* mini 5 meat pizza- yummy! * service- we sat ourselves and had to ask for menus. BUT everyone was friendly and welcoming. Food runner was super nice when he brought out our food  asked us if we needed anything else before he left.Our server was awesome! checked up on us enough to keep us satisfied. =)sorry guys  minus 1 star for the dry pork chop and having to seat ourselves.
Tina R.,Alhambra  CA,25,296,54,9/3/2013,2.0,Food was Ok but  Horrible Service!
Disenchantedone Z.,Los Angeles  CA,6,57,,11/22/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"So...I\'ve got to make amends and say - Service here has gotten way better! I now enjoy coming here. The ladies up front can use a slight ""genuine"" adjustment  but other than that  most servers are well mannered and have done a great job serving us. The last lady that served us got a great tip cause she was ""the best BJ\'s service we\'ve ever gotten."" I know my little yelp comments - my complaints into the world wide web of the unknown - probably had little to do with the improved service (though I\'d like to feel like it did)  but at any rate...I would totally go back there again. Thanks for renewing my faith in your restaurant. PS: Begneit! Begneit! Begneit!"
Rachel C.,Montebello  CA,11,4,,4/28/2014,1.0,"Went with a group of friends to eat here for a celebration. Server was rude and cussed at us. I don\'t care if there is a lot of us and one if you. There is no reason you should be cussing at your customers. Food took forever to come out. One of our orders didnt get put in and after asking for it about 5 times he barely told us. Cancelled 2 of our orders cause it took ridiculously long to come out. When we finally left and gave him a tip. He opened the door to yell at us at the parking lot saying ""thanks for the stupid tip"" rudest customer service ever!!!"
Sam C.,El Monte  CA,0,4,25,12/20/2013,3.0,The food is sooo good went with my family and we all loved our dishes I think this place is going to become a regular for us. As for the service they were not the best they never came to check on us just came to give us the check and you have to wait a long time for your food and the place was not full so that was the down side. Just don't go when you are hungry cause you will get annoyed.
Jackie L.,Los Angeles  CA,84,102,,1/25/2011,3.0,This was your typical casual lounge type eats.. some pasta some sandwiches  pizza  flatbread..We came here for a birthday party and we had a large group. I think we waited maybe about 20 minutes on a saturday night so that wasnt too bad..We had a greatt server I forgot his name :( He was super friendly and took care of us the whole night. We ordered the Ahi Poke (it was not too bad) and the BBQ chicken sandwich.. it was overtoasted and dry and there wasnt enough sauce but I swear there was a whole head of lettuce in there! After we got a free warmed chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of icecream on top and dat was pretty good.Other than that.. it was nothing too special but i mean its Bjs I didnt have high expectations. The server definately put it from a 2 star to a 3!Will I come back?....mmm not sure..
Downtown B.,Los Angeles  CA,254,337,51,4/14/2011,3.0,"Come on  admit it--how many of you tried this place for the first time because you had a gal-pal or buddy that said ""I WANT A PIZOOKIE!"". ""A what?"" you say? Then off you go to find out with a Pizookie is..Their pizza\'s tasty  I\'m more of a thin-crust kind of girl but I I can hang. Keep in mind  I am the pizza-connoisseur-equivalent of a 10 year old..quite happy with Papa John\'s...but I would return repeatedly for beer and pizookie!"
Kim H.,Los Angeles  CA,441,900,459,5/26/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Good selection of beer. Little better food than Yardhouse but similar offerings. These places that try to serve everything just can't seem to get it right on quality of food across the board. It does it's job of chasing the hunger away and with all the tv's and ambiance this place is also perfect for those work lunches where you don't want to talk or don't have anything to say!
Casey B.,Phoenix  AZ,0,49,10,10/9/2013,5.0,Not sure why all the bad reviews. I dinned solo  in town on business. I was seated promptly and the waitress came and took my drink order right away. I ordered strawberry lemonade YUM  a bowl of Tuscan Tomato soup YUM YUM  and the Sesame salad  was good too. I got my soup instantly and the salad came when I finished my last spoonful of soup. Fast friendly service and good food. Thanks!
Russ N.,Monterey Park  CA,57,189,151,3/5/2011,3.0,Pretty good happy hour times (i think 4-7) and decent beers. I would strongly recommend to drinking only the beers they have on tap unless you really want one of those bottled belgium beers (usually have to ask for that menu)food is decentif you get the bazooki desert  make sure you get the normal chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream. the other combinations they have aren't as good.
A M.,La Mirada  CA,0,3,,1/30/2015,1.0,Who is in charge of this place?! The customer service is horrible. Grilled fish tacos are good  getting them is the hard part.
Ashley S.,La Habra  CA,35,7,4,4/1/2014,1.0,"This is how my 4 year old daughters birthday was ruined...My daughter loves the happy face potatoes here. We went last year for her birthday. We had a great experience. We went again this year  per her request. The hostesses were great. After that it was the worst service I\'ve ever received anywhere. It took 40 minutes for us to be able to order. Then once the order was about to be put in  one of my guest suggested we should change the crust of a pizza. The server  Raquel  rudely interrupted our conversation  demanding we tell her right then and there what we wanted. I told her I would let her know when we were done discussing the issue and I would let her manager know myself. Her tone changed immediately. At this point I thought she was already overly rude and asked her to leave the table. As She walked away she said ""I knew this would happen"" loud and clear for my 15 person table full of family to hear. This was so embarrassing to be disrespected in front of my whole family. Then I went to speak with the manager to let her know I wanted another server. I walked into the server bad mouthing me. Then the manager slightly acknowledged me. I went back to our table the manager came and explained she was the GM. put a New server on our table  who we rarely saw. She gave us 3 pizookies and 10 dollars off a 300+ bill. Thanks! Oh yea and they kept some kids vouchers we didn\'t use after all. The only reason for a star at all  are the hostesses and the random server who showed up and gave us boxes and all kinds of waters to go... I hope the tip went to him and him only. I will stick with Pasadena or Downey from now on...."
David K.,San Gabriel  CA,14,118,120,8/12/2008,3.0,Decent large brewhouse/sportsbar chain resturant  food is not cheap however.The food and service has always been pretty good every time I go  though some of the servers seem a little... well... strange.The pizookie is a great dessert if you have never tried one its worth getting at least once.I suprisingly enjoy their salads and sandwiches and burgers and the pizza is okay too.I have gone to the location in arcadia/monrovia for years and years  and for the most part this location is far better then that old one.At least this one doesn't smell like old one does sometimes.
Suzanne L.,Alhambra  CA,1,50,7,6/2/2014,1.0,The food here is just okay  but the service is terrible. Came here with my whole family to celebrate my sister's birthday. The waitress seamed flustered and bothered by having to take care of such a large party. She was rude and unhelpful and when I went to complain to the manager she brushed me off and waived over the assistant manager. He apologized for both the waitress and the manager and did his best to help service the rest of our meal. Meanwhile the manager never even bothered to come speak with us and did her best to not look at us on the way out. All in all definitely not work the trouble for mediocre food.
Rzzzo B.,Eastvale  CA,1,25,12,5/31/2012,1.0,THIS IS THE MOST -ABSOLUTE-WORST-FCKN BJ's ever. go to Arcadia or Chino Hills. PERIOD. this aint even worth my time to post my experience. just read all the other negatives here.
Burrito M.,San Francisco  CA,0,769,49,2/24/2011,2.0,There really is no where to eat in the city of Montebello  CA. So if you gotta grub  I guess you have to go to BJ's. The food is edible  but on par with other chain sit down restaurants (i.e. Chili's  Appleby's  etc).I ordered the 1/2 chicken club w/ a side caesar. The club was decent  but the salad was so gross  the lettuce leaves were wilted and disgusting.I would have rated it a 1  but the service was pretty good  and like I said  there is NO where else to eat!
Eddie G.,Montebello  CA,0,2,5,12/15/2013,1.0,We like to watch football at different restaurants  where the beer selection is good  I enjoy IPAs and ciders. BJs meets the requirements  but the servers there act like they are doing us a favor and decided to argue with us. She got the order wrong and told us what we said was what she brought. I have been in this industry for 20 years and for her to tell us that we were wrong and continued to say it over and over was...... Well we stood up  turned around and slowly walked to the front door. I know she saw us leaving and did nothing to stop us  or try to fix the problem. In stead she cleaned off the table and waited for the next guest to insult. I understand that it is busy and that you maybe a bit stressed  but as someone in the  Service industry you should always handle yourself in a professional manner. One should never make the guest feel bad or sorry that they walked in the door. Bottom line is we are there to spend money and a good time if BJs can't deliver we will go somewhere else. We went across the street to Applebee's. It is really sad when my community and local restaurant gets such a bad review. Listen up all you bad servers please go do something else if you do not enjoy working around people  it will save us all time and frustration. Also to the management that hires these people please don't settle find the right person for the job!! Remember that servers and host are on the front lines they are what makes it or brakes it for us  your food could be out of this world  the beer could be one of a kind but if you treat me like ....... I will never talk about it to my friends and family. As a matter of fact they will only hear the bad stuff because I am spending my hard earned money at a place that took it and punched me in face in the process. It's sad that I need to go to another town or community to spend my money!!! Think about this people.
Cali E.,Los Angeles  CA,1,75,1,6/23/2011,4.0,This review is for the bar area during happy hour.A friend who swears by BJ's for happy hour demanded we go here. It was very crowded and there was nowhere to sit when we first got there. But we camped out near a couple who looked like they were going to leave and got a booth within 5 minutes.We sat down but didn't get any attention from a waiter or busboy for several minutes. It wasn't until we asked for someone to clear and clean the table that they did anything.Aside from the rocky start  once the waitress came by  we were served promptly. The prices are very reasonable for happy hour. My friend and I shared a mini pizza  each got side salads  and shared a mini pazookie (sp?) and I got a sangria and it was all under $22. Not bad!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the tables  even after being wiped off  were still greasy. The salt and pepper shakers also needed to be cleaned.Definitely won't let that stop me though. I'll be back for more soon!
Alberto C.,Burbank  CA,0,19,,10/13/2013,2.0,Took the Mrs for early dinner. My wife ordered a burger which she claims was okay  however fries were served cold. My wife have potato wedges. My Cesar salad wasn't good but I still ate it. It was too tangy and the lettuce tasted old. The portions were small compared to the price. The habit burger grill has the best Cesar salad. They get it right all the time. My clam chowder was awesome. The portion and temperature were perfect. I needed something hot because the place was too cold. I'm glad I a wore a sweater. The waiter was great and the place was very clean. The manager came by but we did not tell how we really felt about the food. We were disappointed.
Johnny L.,Monterey Park  CA,621,44,,9/5/2010,4.0,One of my favorite spotsGood for happy hour! 3-7pm (m-friday)  and late night happy hour 10pm - 1am (sunday - thursday)$4 pint house brewed beers here are awesome.I recommend the jeremiah red if it's your first.But you can also ask the bartender to mix the beers for you if you're into that  A red + blonde  is a perfect mix by the way.but they have a great menu  and the staffs here are friendly  especially the bartenders. they might be slow on the service sometimes  depending on how busy it is but just be on top of your server and they'll pay attention
Leslie T.,Rosemead  CA,358,57,4,8/15/2012,3.0,A typical place my friends and I go to have birthday celebrations. Probably because of the free mini pizookie they give. I think that's my favorite thing about this place  the pizookies. Anyway  I got the scampi pasta which was pretty good. The shrimp was very flavorful and I liked the lemony taste of the angel hair pasta. The garlic bread was mediocre though. Although the food was good  the service was terrible. When we asked for the check and to-go boxes  it took forever and our waiter forgot the to-go boxes. I'll probably return every now and then...
Shirley L.,San Gabriel  CA,139,31,16,2/20/2013,2.0,Came in here for lunch with my sister this afternoon and when we walked in  the host in the front was wiping windows and didn't greet us and just looked at us. There was another lady in the front but she didn't bother asking us anything or greeting us. Atleast our waitress was alright. But the food wasn't. My chicken fettuccine alfredo tasted really plain and came with probably 8 strands of noodles. The pizza was whatever. Right before we left  some customers were leaving and were greeted with a bye. When we left  we got nothing. I thought these restaurants were all about customer service.
Berta R.,Whittier  CA,108,6,1,11/2/2014,5.0,This BJs has always been good to me! Don't know why it got bad reviews. I love it! Food is great  service is great  it's always busy which may be a good or bad thing depending how you feel. I love it and I still continue to go!
Kendall Y.,Oakland  CA,0,10,5,12/2/2013,1.0,"Staggers the imagination  it really does. I did not know a business with this poor quality food and service still existed. I wished I had read a few Yelps before going.I\'ll make this brief:1) awful food2) worse serviceMy burger looked like a (literally...) McDonalds cheesburger  they got the order wrong... twice... too forever to served. Ok look  I understand this is not ""fine dining"" but does it have to be THIS BAD? It is an embarasement  really it is. I suggest run  don\'t walk from this place...."
Jimmy K.,Rowland Heights  CA,79,48,92,10/25/2012,2.0,I'd give it a 1.5 if I could. I honestly never really liked BJ's. The food is whatever  I'll eat it but it's not something I ever crave for. The service here sucks. It must be because we are Asian or something. We were quickly seated but the waiters took forever to come take our orders. So long to the a point where I wanted to leave. There were many waiters walking by us but never even looked at us when we tried to get their attention. There were about 5 tables that were seated AFTER us and the waiters were very prompted in getting their orders. Those 5 tables weren't Asian guests...I'm just saying. Finally the waitress came and took our order. The food and drinks came out pretty quick but she didn't even bring us small plates for the appetizers. That should come out right after we put the order in. The waitress also took forever to refill my drink. And I thought Korean restaurants had bad service.
Jer D.,Los Angeles County  CA,9,37,12,3/25/2013,2.0,"I don\'t know what happened with their deep dish pizza or what kind of corporate agenda they\'ve got at BJ\'s but I was disappointed with their so-called ""deep dish"" pizza. It\'s no longer served in a deep dish pan but in a tray. I haven\'t been there in a while but this happened? Not pleased because i obviously went there to have their signature Deep dish. Chicago deep dish is no longer at BJ\'s. I liked how it tastes but i expected something else. That\'s what is keeping it from better earned stars"
Haik K.,San Francisco  CA,402,474,13,2/6/2010,1.0,Alright. THe first time I went to this place I took my little sister so we could check out Montebello's new place to eat and drink. The PLACE IS PACKED all the time. The place attracts mostly a clean cut  family oriented  non-raunchy types. Big Woop. The reason this place gets 1 star is because my friends decided to get me drinks when I turned 21. Great friends. They called BJs and said if it would be alright if we came in at midnight  and started drinking. They said YES. When we got there  I had a couple drinks in me already and the waitress sat us allll down  made us order our food and drinks  but told me I COULDNT HAVE ANYTHING TO DRINK. Well FUCK YOU BJs for your CORPORATE TRIFLING WAYS. They made everyone pay for their food and take it to go. We went to ORDONEZ  which is  despite considered by some to be worse than BJ  turned out to be a place where they could respect a man and his friends in festivities. Even the people around us were buying our party drinks. THATS A REAL FUCKING BUSINESS  LOVE YOU ORDONEZ AND HOPE BJs can go out of business and be replaced with a payless shoe store. The bartenders are cool  but the rest of the service pretty much sucks.Oh yeah  another thing that gets me about this place is that ALL OF A FUCKING SUDDEN  everyone in the area goes out for drinks here. As if a great institution like Charlie Browns across the street was never there. Psh...goes to show you that if you have a Corporate name on your side  youll get all the fake ass people with the shittiest service with sub-par food and crappy tasting homemade beer.NEGATIVE STARS.
R A.,Anaheim  CA,0,17,4,8/22/2013,1.0,Wow what the f! Got seated and waited 20 minutes until we were able to flag someone down. Pissed off  didn't even bring our soda until we were done eating. $0 tip  goodbye. Never again.
Trish C.,La Puente  CA,35,20,1,7/18/2012,1.0,Screw this place  the service sucks and the food is lacking flavor. Stay away from the turkey burger  the only good part of it is mushrooms & avocado.The waiters here are extremely rude and just want to get you the hell out of there. It's always super packed and you will always get shitty service.
Claudia V.,Whittier  CA,2,11,2,1/17/2010,2.0,My husband and I always resort to this bj's because it's close to home but we always leave disappointed. Yesterday was the kicker. We were seated immediately but it took the waiter about 15 mins to acknowledge us. It took another 15 mins to get our salads. It took a few more for the waiter to fetch silverware so we were just staring at our salads for a while. 5 minutes later  our entrees came. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the chicken pasta. The pasta was a little dry. My husband requested malt vinegar to go with his fish but finished his meal before it got cold. The waiter came 10 mins later with it claiming he had to refill the ice bin. Aren't customers their first priority? Food was so-so and the service was horrible!!!!
Michele S.,Montebello  CA,58,98,17,6/8/2010,2.0,When you tell someone it's going to be 50 minutes for a table  know what you are talking about. I checked on my reservation and I was told there were 40 people ahead of me! FORTY!! so it would be another 40-50 minutes. I've been here before and the food is fine  but this lack in knowledge and wasting my time makes me think twice about trying you again.
chavo d.,Los Angeles  CA,183,181,1111,11/15/2010,3.0,Great lunch specials  but hit-and-miss service. Sometimes you get a friendly and bright individual  but now and again  you get the doe eyed apathetic teenage drone.Like Libby R. says. BJ's is all about the Pizookie; sound advise. Next time I'll come for the gigantic cookie bar-side  and avoid the robots.
Diego A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,13,,7/9/2013,4.0,Service was good. Food was good but food did take a little long to get to our table on a slow day.
Daisy A.,Los Angeles  CA,10,144,35,10/30/2012,1.0,"We phoned in an order and were told it be ready in 15 min. We show up and are told the ""takeout guy"" is out on a delivery and will be back in 15 min...we had to wait while our order is sitting there ready and ALL the ""non takeout"" Employees are standing around chatting. Baloney. Stupid people."
Rosie S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,,10/20/2014,4.0,Had the turkey burger (my new trend  not eating red meat but once a week) it has a good taste and very filling! It comes with fat or skinny fries. Everything that I have tried at BJ's has always been good! Even their lunch specials are filling!
Jess J.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,6/16/2013,2.0,"The food is good but seriously sometimes the waiters...... I mean seriously some are just horrible!Tall blond guy.... slow took FOREVER to bring a sample of beer and when my boyfriend did get it was warm.Girl with red hair..... only came to our table twice... she asked us if our food was okay..when we did not even touch it because our beer took AN HOUR TO ARRIVE AT OUR TABLE.... and they brought us the wrong beer. We just asked to get our beer with our food..... Ha.... Nice work you two!I think the only good thing about the service was that the waiter  who had mostly all the tables and a party of 20 or more people was able to give us good service. I think this BJ\'s is okay  certain food is really good and certain food is not. The beer they have here is good too.But seriously like one person said ""service is a hit-or-miss"" here.And this night was not the only time the waiters are just whatever  it has happen a couple times. Another time our waiter actually sat with us to take our order and even asked for his tip because he was leaving early."
Gladys R.,Los Angeles  CA,17,23,12,5/29/2012,1.0,"First time trying BJ\'s after hearing many good things from many different people  I was disappointed. Bad service  disagreeable food  worthless experience. Came in around 9:30pm  group of 4  as a hang out. Ordered drinks  all good. Ordered the wedges fries to start off and the others ordered a ""Pizookie"". Why did it take over 40 minutes to get some fries and a cookie?? And the restaurant was rather empty! I had considered ordering an entree but the wait and unappetizing options on the menu turned me off. We got the fries and pizookie after what felt and was very much likely an hour. You could taste the frozen storage inside the hot yum-looking fries-- Not fresh  not cool! The cookie was good but what hot cookie doesn\'t taste good? The ice-cream was forgettable. My friend got ugly oranges on his Blue Moon and when he ordered a second one  I\'m sure our server forgot after 20min. about it and the bartender brought it over. Don\'t plan on coming back... That\'s why I usually stay away from big restaurant food chains because they get away with crappy food and bad service but make tons of money thanks to tv commercials that lie."
Christopher C.,Montebello  CA,1,29,1,11/24/2012,5.0,This place gets extremely packed on weekends. Thank goodness for the fast servers and waitresses here. I they take your order in a snap  and although the food takes a while to come around  it is without a doubt delicious! We spent about an hour and fifty minutes total for a short family dinner and had to order and extra entre to go for my brother which took about half our stay here. The manager approached us and told us that he was extremely sorry for the wait and that it wasn't right that it took so long and gave us a new bill in which he took off the price of the extra entre we ordered. The place is run the right way and it's nice seeing true service like that.
Stephanie L.,Manhattan Beach  CA,827,101,12,1/17/2008,4.0,"LOL! I\'ve been reading these comments about the Montebello Mall.. I will have to admit  it is ghetto as all get out. I grew up in the South Bay  so I am used to Class A rated retail. Anyhow  this BJ\'s is right across the place from where I work  so it is very convenient for me :)I have gotten to know a couple of the bartenders and their service is unparalleled.... the food to me was ""ok"" -- I am not really a fan of BJ\'s food but the Blackened Chicken sandwich rocked. The pizza was decent. I can\'t really complain. The only thing I will complain about is the ghetto-ness. I hope this place lasts... it always seems to be busy  at least when I am there!"
Jennifer Z.,San Gabriel  CA,291,4,,5/26/2013,3.0,"I planned a birthday ""dinner"" (which started at 4PM because they couldn\'t take later reservations). The manager there was VERY impatient and rude over the phone. Things were more complicated than they had to be. It was understandable that at least half of the party had to arrive before we went in and the waitresses there were nice and welcoming! The food was alright... Or at least what I ordered when reserving was. We paid $20 each for 3 kinds of pizza  one salad  and one pasta and many of us paid extra for large pizookies. But the $20 definitely wasn\'t worth it. I give it a 3 only because the service there was nice. But the manager most definitely gave me a bad impression."
Anthony V.,Montebello  CA,56,34,7,10/8/2010,4.0,I go to BJs for the beer and sport events  everything else is a bonus. The beer selection is pretty good. The Jeremiah red is tasty  the hefe is light but satisfying and the occasional seasonal is decent. My beer choices usually come off the Belgian menu though. Chimay's  Duvel  Orval  Delirium Tremens  Westmalle  etc. That is a pretty impressive list of beers for a chain restaurant. The food varies and can be hit or miss. I love the buffalo chicken pizza  buffalo wings and the french dip. They aren't top of class plates at all but they go well with beer. The food here isn't supposed to knock you out of your seat  its supposed to be something you throw in your stomach to compliment the beer. Its good for what it is and most of the time its satisfying. Don't come here expecting much and you will leave pleasantly surprised.
J M.,Los Angeles  CA,25,23,8,6/29/2010,1.0,Worst service EVER! 2nd time coming here. Ordered my food and received something entirely different. Brought it to the attention of our waitress and was told I was wrong-mind you  she never wrote down our order but informed us she would remember! First time here was for my birthday where everyone else received their food and had eaten it but I never got mine! NEVER AGAIN......I would rather eat at Burger King upstairs!
Tiffany I.,Rosemead  CA,1829,79,5,10/21/2012,4.0,I really like the location of the restaurant! This location is so close and so convenient as well. Everytime I wanted to go to a BJ's  I either had to drive all the way to the one in Monrovia or in Covina. Then  I realized a Pizooki isn't worth my gas and time if I can just get one over here close by.
Danny E.,Los Angeles  CA,0,14,,3/29/2014,5.0,i love this bj's! bj's house brews are always great love theyre pizza ! love the burger combos here! i love theyre wings! grea great great happy hour prices and ive never had a problem with service here in fact ive run into some fun great beer knowing servers here! and its a great place to catch a game(a lot of tv's)! no complaints at all!
Jay K.,Los Angeles  CA,1130,338,660,9/19/2010,4.0,The service was simply outstanding. I made a large party reservations  the reservationist was absolutely polite and upbeat. When we got there  the table was ready PRIOR to our arrival. The server was the best I had in a long time. He was busy  but attentive  accommodating and sincerely nice. All this when the place was packed w/ guest. Thumbs way up based upon service!!!
Maria S.,Los Angeles  CA,56,9,5,4/29/2013,2.0,Noisey  parking is ALLwAYS a problem  and as busy as this place gets one would think that management would schedule accordingly.  But this is not the case.  They were understaffed and service was therefore terrible. Just to get the bill the wait was about 40 min.
Christopher M.,Pomona  CA,0,5,1,6/29/2013,4.0,The atmosphere is very relaxed with a hint of bustle. The food was prepared in a timely manner. The temperature was a very welcome escape from the scorching heat of the summer sun.
Steve G.,Los Angeles  CA,28,82,45,10/31/2012,3.0,Spoons and forks are dirty  there beer is good. new variety of food... something different.. pizza is good. descent.. !
Ralph C.,Chino Hills  CA,1,4,,12/14/2009,4.0,When me and the wife come here it's always to the bar. It gets pretty packed here. They have some pretty good brews. I like the Jeremiah Red and just recently tried the delicious Tatonka Stout. Both strong beers. Happy Hour is the best time to come. You can't really beat $3.50 for some nice beers. And half-priced mini pizza. My wife is a fan of their potstickers  especially for $2 off appetizers. Oh  and a mini pizzookie with your stout to finish it off. And that's Happy Hour... Let's see.. on the actual meal side  I've had:Burger melt with seasoned wedge fries - Awesome with that sauce they put in...Jambalaya which is really spicy (Not recommended before bedtime)Chili in a bread bowl - Really good as well. My wife said it tasted like Weinershnitzel. But I like Weinershnitzel. So that's a good thing. Overall  the service is really good. They had their problems when they first opened  but everything runs much smoother now. The ambiance is very laid back  which i like. It's not too loud or anything. It's a very Hispanic BJ's. Very comfortable. I don't feel like i belong when I'm in a restaurant full of white people. sorry. Growing up in East L.A. does that to you  i guess. Oh  first review! I did it! :D
William M.,Baldwin Park  CA,252,439,155,4/25/2010,2.0,I met a friend here for lunch today-We sat at the bar so we could catch the NBA playoff game.Bar was kinda empty maybe 5-6 tables taken.Bartender comes out to greet us and take our drink orders.The thing that bugs me is they dont carry the beer I like (fat tire).So I order the turkey club since I had pizza the other day.Plus Im not a huge fan of their pizza. Its way greasy.Turkey club was ok - nothing special about it.The service could have been better IMO. She hardly came back to check on us  my buddy ordered another beer and it took forever for her to get it and by this time there was someone backing her up at the bar.The food was ehhhh and the service was blah......and it wasnt busy.
Kat L.,Monterey Park  CA,169,31,6,1/23/2013,3.0,Even though there were many negative comments on this place my friends and i still decided to try this bjs out. Our waiter was very attentive and always came back occasionally to check on us and to refill our drinks although the wait was 40 minutes i would say that this should not be the bjs of your choice. Their cream sodas look like sodas but do taste like cream usually they would serve it in mugs with cream looking on top but for some reason all we got was regular looking soda. The steak were A-OK  their pasta and calamari was A-OK because it was left sitting out too long or in the fryer too long because the calamari came out soggy.
Stephanie D.,Monterey Park  CA,199,96,85,8/21/2012,4.0,Great menu with lots of variety... some of it is pricey but well worth it. Everything they serve is full of flavor.
Jeggicah C.,San Gabriel Valley  CA,11,181,146,2/6/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,why people give 3 stars with pretty good views  I have no clue. Service is pretty good here  and even though its at Montebello Mall  I can appreciate that the mall is upgrading itself from its old school Raider Nation days and added this restaurant in addition to Marie Calendars. I was here for a party and the catering was great with spaghetti and pizza. Came on my own  and still felt the pizza was good  but their salads are amazing! The cobb (minus bacon) is soooo good. I love that they dice the salad so small that you don't have to take your knife to it just so you can fit it in your mouth. Its chilled perfectly that it just makes you want more. The same goes for their BBQ chicken and caesar. Their appetizers are pretty good  mostly i enjoy the artichoke / spinach dip and Santa Fe spring rolls. I'd skip out on avocado rolls unless you really really love avocados  and I do mean really. Pizza of course their speciality  is great and full of carbs  reckless to the body  but great for the soul.
Sarah M.,Boston  MA,106,86,1,10/24/2012,1.0,The pizza arrived cold. The waitress refused to even acknowledge our table for probably half an hour and wouldn't bring our food out without a manager's intervention. I was actually scared that the pizza was undercooked and had meat on it. They are going to make people sick with this raw meat and terrible service.
Terri C.,Los Angeles  CA,3,16,9,2/10/2013,1.0,They sat us down and took about 10 minutes to take our drink order. Our waitress brings the coffee and it is all a mess. The coffee spilled all into the saucer. Server stated she would bring a new cup  never brought it. Even after I asked for a new cup since the coffee was cold. Finally took our food order. 45 minutes later  our waitress is no where to be seen and our food has not arrived. Well it did  put another server gave it to the table next to us. But  wait it gets better  not only did the server not notice that he delivered the wrong food  neither did the patrons who received it. Everyone around us   who were seated after we were received their food before we did. Asked both our server and the server who gave our food to another table to call the manager  but he never came over. We had to call him over. The worst service I have ever received. Clueless Staff and Clueless Manager.
Adriana Z.,La Puente  CA,4,1,,3/14/2013,5.0,I highly recommend Bj's. I enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly staff. I like their mojitos and their pizza is amazing!!!
Josh V.,Montebello  CA,37,13,3,2/19/2012,5.0,Very dope place to go with friends  family or even a date. Awesome food  good prices  service can be better though. But it's a good place to have lunch or dinner at  I enjoy there salads  sandwiches an there deserts 6:
Justin T.,Los Angeles  CA,180,91,64,6/4/2012,3.0,We had a platter combination  a burger and salad. Food was ok  service not that good.
Dana P.,North Hills  CA,65,299,28,2/13/2010,3.0,I am a huge BJ's fan. We order here for work often for parties and such.This location looks nice  but the servers virtually vanish into thin air once you order which makes it painful to come here on your lunch hour.Also  we had a couple of screw ups with the to-go orders  but nothing TOO major.Will continue to come here  but they really need to work on the customer service.
Thomas T.,Placentia  CA,35,49,,5/8/2011,3.0,I go here for three reasons - Jeremiah Red  Great White pizza  and to watch the Lakers or Dodgers Play. The service can get slow and sloppy during happy hour  but the quality of the food is always good. One thing to pay extra attention to is the cleanliness of the plates and glasses on the table. I have seen numerous things left over on dishes  such as salad on a plate or lip gloss on a beer glass that the dish washing machine failed to remove. Overall  A-OK.
Cynthia A.,Montebello  CA,2,11,,4/7/2014,3.0,Great salafs. Great drinks. Child friendly. A lil pricey. Always crowded. Long waiting but they move pretty fast. Service can be improved. Way too noisy. Tiny full bar area
Eric H.,Whittier  CA,10,69,2,7/1/2009,3.0,This is like most of the other BJ's (if you know the chain)  just smaller. We've had mixed luck with dinner service  but weekday lunches are very fast and service is excellent if you just sit at the bar. Joshlind is there most weekdays  and is fantastic - the food consistently comes out fast from the kitchen right behind the bar. Only frustrating part is I have to stick to root beer because I have to go back to work after :-( but I highly recommend the Nutty Brewnette if you are free to imbibe.For the un-initiated  the highlights here are craft beers  Chicago-style pizzas (deep-dish with chunky tomatoes) and the Pizookie  which is a warm-mushy cookie in a pie plate  topped by a huge scoop of ice-cream  which is great for sharing.
Tanya P.,Los Angeles  CA,35,39,5,2/16/2012,5.0,I love this bj's! I come here at least once a month. Yes the wait can be long  but you're always warned. The servers are always nice. We had an issue with our recently and they were so gracious about it that we couldn't be upset about it  everyone makes mistakes. The manager  Alfredo personally came and apologized and comped out dessert. We didn't need a free dessert  but he didn't have to comp anything. The food and drinks are always yummy  but I think the excellent customer service keeps us coming back.
Andy F.,Whittier  CA,118,175,15,8/25/2011,4.0,BJ's Brewhouse is the same all around. Good mini pizza's specially when they are on happy hour prices  can't go wrong with one of those. I had the pepperoni and mushrooms always a favorite. This location is a good size  I always enjoy the bar area since they have plenty of TV's to keep you up to date on sports.
Eric B.,Alhambra  CA,221,8,,8/23/2010,3.0,This place is a good place to go have appetizers and watch sports events.the service is okay not the best.it gets really crowded when there is a sports game on.the food is good. i love their clam chowder.their entrance spin door is a plus.tvs are all over so you can watch anything on espn.they have a fully stocked bar and brew of their own mix.the parking is kind of bad because they share with the mall.
Vicki L.,Stockton  CA,60,73,21,7/15/2011,2.0,We came on a weekday around lunch time. It was pretty empty considering it was lunch time  at a mall  and during summer. We were seated a few minutes after entering the restaurant but the waitress took about 10 minutes to get to our table. We ordered our drinks and food right away since they gave us such a long time to look over the menu. It took about 20-30 minutes to get our food. We waited for such a long time but the waitress never came by to tell us when our food was coming or anything. I was a bit disappointed by the amount of time it took. Service seemed pretty slow all around though.. judging from the people around me twiddling their thumbs waiting for their food too.
Bijan A.,Montebello  CA,332,73,75,6/15/2009,3.0,Ok  I've been a fan of Bj's since I first discovered them years ago. This location though  not so much. the food is what you expect from Bj's. Everything has always been served piping hot and tasty from my experiences. The only complaint I have to this location is the wait time. The servers are very friendly and informative but they just don't seem to have the rhythm down. They lack the skills. You'll soon go parched and pass out of thirst before you see a server within range to be flagged down. And the time that goes by from being seated to having someone come and ask to take your order is sometimes ridiculous. The food has always come quickly when I've visited though. I was there for the Laker game last night  GO LAKERS  and we ordered burgers  appetizers  and a sandwich and had it all at the table in just under 10 minutes which was a huge surprise given how busy it was. This location is not the cleanest either. I usually find myself asaking to have the table wiped down again when I'm seated. Sorry  but I don't like a greasy table to eat at. Gross. This place is  in my opinion  average. Nothing special. Decent prices some good food. Definitely not a place to go for dates  to take your parents to  or even co workers. LOL. Just a spot to eat with some buddies maybe. I prefer the other BJ's locations over this one.
Gwen S.,La Verne  CA,20,15,1,8/7/2011,4.0,I've been coming here once in a while when I visit my family. It's pretty good service and the food is great. I love the chicken wings and the desserts  yummy! I'll be coming back! =)
Laura R.,Whittier  CA,6,117,1,1/2/2012,3.0,My best friend invited me to dinner with her daughter. She suggested BJ's and I agreed. I had only been there once before  but had always wanted to come back. I ordered the parmesan chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. When it came the side of broccoli consisted of like three tiny little florets. My friend asked for more and they did bring some but I just kept thinking of that scene in the movie Road Trip with the pancakes and the horror stories my brother Vince told me about his days working in McDonald's. I always try my best to be nice and polite to my food handlers for fear of retaliation. Just saying. So the food was good  and my dessert was even better. A baked beignet with a scope of vanilla ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream...interesting take on the strawberry shortcake. It was delicious. All in all  I couldn't complain about the food or the service. I hear it gets really crowded at night and that you might bump into someone you know if you grew up in the area  but I didn't see anyone I recognized. The hamburger my friend's daughter got looked really tasty and I guess it was with the way they devoured that thing.All in all it was a good experience with some good food. There are a couple of dishes I wouldn't mind coming back to try  oh yeah and that baked beignet.
Stephanie V.,Los Angeles  CA,108,66,24,1/22/2012,4.0,BJ's is one of those restaurants that always delivers. They have good happy hour and the pizza here is great. They have a good selection of beers and home brews. Great place to catch a game  but hard to find seating once the game is going so make sure you go early enough to find seating. The staff is good and knowledgeable.
Jer C.,Monterey Park  CA,11,19,1,4/11/2009,3.0,Came to this place for a birthday gathering that the girlfriend's middleschool friend threw. Swivel Door!!There were a couple of pizzas  a salad  and alfredo. I liked the pizzas; they were very warm  thick and soft. But they're just pizzas  so it doesn't get more complicated than that. The girlfriend complained about how thick the crust is  but I thought it was alright as long as they weren't stiff and dry like the usual fast-food pizzas out there. I liked the MEDITERRANEAN pizza over the BARBEQUE CHICKEN and SWEET PIG. Sorry it's in all Caps  I pasted from the Site Menu.The Alfredo was alright. Very thick sauce. The pasta was a bit stiff  though. But nothing a hungry asian can't handle. The BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD was pretty good  though. I especially liked the black beans that they put in there. I must say  though  for a big group of 40+  we sure had good service. The first waitress that took our orders for our drinks (and continued asking if we needed refills every 10 minutes) was friendly  cute  and patient. The girlfriend immediately struck up a conversation with her about Target pens =_=Lastly  the root beer; rich  smooth  nice. And as an added bonus  I met a very interesting couple. Schwing!
Fanon P.,Los Angeles  CA,215,388,248,9/5/2011,3.0,Ok another attendance of one of those dreaded bday bad restaurant of choice celebrations! Today folks behind door number 1 is BJ'S (insert cheer track). Ok what really made my gears grind were the little ass cups of beer at this location  and the fact our waitress had no clue of life  Other than that I had fun  and drunk a lot  I ordered buffalo wings and these bad boys were screaming! I mean I didn't even expect the wings to be this damn good  definitely took me by surprise  they were cooked perfectly. only other thing I had were the avocado egg rolls and those were aight  but I now know what my favorite thing on the menu here is. HOTWINGS
Matthew C.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,185,12,16,7/21/2011,5.0,Everyone there was so friendly and had a great environment. The food was prepared quickly and had great service. The beer selection of house beers are great try the Jeremiah red gets you wasted quick
H. M.,Los Angeles  CA,1300,133,253,10/31/2012,1.0,had just tried bj's for my dinner last night with my bff actor/artist/model  m.t. and while waiting to be seated  noticed the very stunning art deco era spinning glass entrance doors. loved it! and the interior lightings reminded me of a mini vegas casino restaurant area which was pleasant. a little vaca imagination. but the whole restaurant was not completely packed and yet the wait (for a very hungry person as myself who hadn't yet eat all day because i was occupied with work) was a bit long. the so called five minutes wait was actually 30 mins wait. as we were led to our booth  we had ordered and the waitress left to take orders from her other tables. as my bff  m.t. and i were waiting for our dinners  my caesar salad arrived and i immediately noticed there were no forks  spoons  and napkins on our table. which was naturally an epic fail in management. how the manager seem to bypass the training of his employee/waitresses and waiters was a very big question mark. AND THIS HAPPENS AT EVERY BJ'S! tried them all to see if there's any difference. no difference at all. furthermore  bj's strawberry lemonade was way too sweet. the drink was calling out  diabetes?! don't mean to be funny here but the drink was sweeter than sugar cubes themselves. and bj's pasta (the fusilloni pasta in which they mistakenly had in their menus as ritoli/rinoldi noodles) was a bit soggy when the pastas should've been a bit harder. overall first impression of this place did not meet up to its fine and lux decor. quite disappointment.
Ianne M.,West Covina  CA,75,7,9,4/28/2012,1.0,I'll give this branch 1 star! very slow and lousy service even when very few people are there + waiters are rude! will never eat here again!
Edith R.,Los Angeles  CA,42,29,,1/23/2012,4.0,I've gone twice and don't have much to complain about.The food is great. I've ordered the jambalaya and it's amazing!The beer is also very good.The service was more than great. The floors can be slippery so be very careful when u walk. I fell and unfortunately I cant blame it on the alcohol :( if it werent for this i would have given it a 5 star
Jose C.,Whittier  CA,0,29,1,1/8/2012,3.0,I usually avoid chain restaurants but I come here for lunch at the insistence of my colleagues. They have decently priced lunch specials. The Cajun talapia is pretty good.
Airi M.,Pasadena  CA,266,62,7,11/6/2010,3.0,Pizzas rocks!! Pizzookies ROCKS!! Great place to go with friends and cool ppl. I live too far  but that place made me find other Tjs around my area!!
George A.,Pico Rivera  CA,14,12,79,4/11/2011,5.0,Me and my friends come here and I like it I love there pizza lol really good and service it's really nice
Alison W.,San Jose  CA,374,1586,929,6/7/2011,3.0,Every time I come to BJs  I think I should really try their deep dish pizza. I've only ever had deep dish in Chicago but there's looks pretty good too. But then I always get their lunch specials. This time I had the half sandwich and soup entree. I got the chicken club and the clam chowder. It was really good. Chowder was a bit salty so I could only have half of it before giving up. And the chicken was cooked well - not dry and it went well with the other ingredients in the sandwich. It also came with the option of steak fries - I love steak fries and these were seasoned really well. My friend got the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Kinda a small potion but it was only like $6 so it was expected. They offer half a sandwich for a dollar less which would be good for a kid but you'll barely be full just on the whole sandwich. Then cause it was my birthday  I also got a mini pizookie for free. I'd never seen their mini size before. It's perfect for one but of course  I shared with my friend. For birthdays  they used to offer the regular size pizookie of any flavor but now they're skimping and only had the mini one of chocolate chip flavor. Oh well - still delicious. It wasn't too busy during a weekday lunch but our waiter seemed very scarce. Could do better in that department. Otherwise  this is def one of my fav chain places due mostly to their pizookie. Mmmm.
Bart S.,Montebello  CA,0,4,,5/19/2013,1.0,Went there this morning. Okay  I admit I probably did a poor job of ordering  but I ordered the scrambled egg breakfast. Eggs were bone dry  hash browns were bone dry. Sourdough bread was bone dry after trying to butter it with a few frozen butter bricks. Daughter got a baked potato and soup. Wife got a pasta. $47 bill. Should have gone to Marie Calendars.
Adrian L.,Los Angeles  CA,40,11,4,10/18/2013,5.0,Pizza is good  but extra good with beer and good company here. Had the pepperoni extreme. Very good. Was there on a game night. Dodgers were playing  restaurant had enough tables for walk in customers.
Chance B.,Anaheim  CA,223,23,,12/5/2011,5.0,I love this place... My better half and I order pizza to go and they got the order wrong so I had to high tale it back because white bread is not an option...once I told them they gave back the same pizza and said have it we will make a new!!! Service food and beers are always the best here!!!! Forever a loyal patron and guest!!!!!!
Art N.,San Francisco  CA,81,26,,6/24/2011,2.0,Consistently bad service. well at least they are consistent right? Everyone in the area knows how terrible the service can be at this location. Recently I had to ask for straws and silverware. Beverage refills and condiments we ordered for our food 3 times (yes  told the server 3 times to get us a sauce) food gets to the table at completely different times from the rest of the people you are dining with. I've gotten my salad after my entree and the food has been cold. The only thing i recommend is to have an appetizer. Its straight forward and hard to mess up. I have faith in this restaurant  more so due to its geographical location convenience but service really has made me go elsewhere.
Javier J.,Los Angeles  CA,1658,1996,248,5/28/2008,3.0,The Montebello Mall. You really can't get more Ghetto than this. The only problem is that it doesn't want to admit how ghetto it actually is. It hides behind some higher end shops that the are way out of the league of the average Montebello shoppers range. You have a Coach store. I'm surprised most didn't realize it was actually spelled Coach and not Couch  as their flea market knock off's would have been labelled as. Back to BJ's. It looks nice  then again  it may as well not even be in the mall as the only entrance is located outside of the mall. A detail that allows them to serve alcohol and stay open past the hours of the mall  I bet. The place is small for a BJ's. But what it lacks in size it makes up with numbers of TV's they have. If you're ever in the mood to watch a Lakers  Raiders or Dodgers game  you're more than welcome here. Unless you're routing for the other time. In which case don't wear your colors  you'll get shanked. The bar area is huge. there's a large wall of liquor that just makes you want to hold your liver and be thankful it still works. Which can lead to a nicely brewed beer. They have many seasonal beers that will peak your interest and the sampler will have you on the floor. With all this talk about beer you'll need to fill that stomach with some food. BJ's  as a chain  is pretty good. Over all the pizza quality and sandwiches are ones that I can't get enough of.Just don't walk into the mall. I guess it's a saving grace that they aren't any possible chances of stepping into the mall when you walk in here. Separated by glass  you can look at all those folks in the crappy mall shop away as you drink some good beer and drown your sorrows of being near the Montebello Mall with a piezookie.
nar b.,Los Angeles  CA,6,31,4,8/25/2011,1.0,"Everyyyy time I go to a BJ\'s  they always mess up! The most recent time I went  however  sucked! Don\'t get me wrong  the food IS good but they always screw everything up. For example: I had ordered a certain type of pizza  they brought me the totally wrong thing! When I nicely asked about it  the server replied  ""Oh no  that\'s it."" Um  nooo! I know what I ordered! The ingredients in the description didn\'t even match what I got! He kept saying  ""No  this is right!"" Whateverrrr. Also  my friend got a sandwich and they brought out the fries in the end. Wth?? They also took foreverrrrrr in bringing us food! Even our water! Really  it takes 25 minutes to bring water?!?! and eggrolls?! and then missing french fries and getting my pizza wrong? Ugh. He did give us free dessert for ""waiting for the food"" but still! Hmph."
Fernando Z.,Los Angeles  CA,86,52,76,4/8/2009,1.0,This BJ's is just a regular restaurant. Nothing screams out above average. The service is poor since our waiter got one of the food orders in my group wrong and also spilled beer on my friend when he brought our drinks to the table. The waiters have a tendency of dropping and spilling things since I saw them drop plates and a pitcher of water on a table with customers sitting there.The food here is just ok. I had a Cobb salad but it just lacked flavor. It just needed more bleu cheese dressing. My friend had the pizza and looked very good but I rather go somewhere else for pizza than coming here for it.
Tatiana D.,Pico Rivera  CA,54,48,,3/26/2008,4.0,"Nice addition to the Monteghetto mall!I LOVE pizookie!!The service here is okay. Seems like everyones new and doesn\'t really know what they\'re doing. I expected more from a ""high volume"" restaurant. When you get there when they\'re about to close  they tend not to care about you too much. I\'m sure they just want you out but I\'d probably do the same if I worked a closing shift."
Mick G.,San Diego  CA,500,502,54,5/3/2008,2.0,I am not a huge chain food fan  but BJ's has always managed to sorta stay on top of the fray a bit to me ...Until I dropped in here.1. LOUD. REALLY LOUD. SCREAMING LOUD inside.2. Poor poor poor service.3. Overall: LAME.
Tania m.,Azusa  CA,69,149,104,6/17/2008,3.0,"JUST A NOTE: the first time I went to BJ\'s was the one in Monrovia and they had excellent service. Then we went to Montebello...........-1 star right off the back for having TERRIBLE service. When someone makes a reservation and the staff is aware that a party of 13 will be arriving  wouldn\'t it be logical to be prepared and ready to serve?!?! NO! It took them forever to ask us what we wanted to drink  then it took them just as long to bring us our drinks. When we would ask for 2 drinks they\'d bring us 1. And what was their excuse? ""we were changing the keg""  wow i didn\'t know it took 45 min to change a keg! (and YES I DO KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO CHANGE A KEG I WORK AT DODGERS!!! 2 SECONDS)By the way... they still managed to charge us for that second drink they never brought us. HMMM!Now that I\'ve made it clear how sucky the service was... THE FOOD...They finally managed to get our drink order right  so did they take our orders? NO!? Another 15 for them to ask us what we wanted to eat. YAY!Finally the food arrived and even though the service sucked I must say I DO like the food. Well at least what I had. (avocado egg rolls  HUGE bake potato and the apple crisp) Also  I must give props to the beer (the blond)Some dishes are kinda pricey but 13 people ate  drank and had dessert. Finally cost $300.00 including the tip. Not too bad..."
L S.,San Gabriel  CA,122,85,2,9/17/2008,2.0,services here is horrible  came here last night with a group of friends to celeberate a bday. We first ordered a pitcher of blondie and they ended up bringing out a pitcher of hef. To be honest this wasn't really a big deal because beer is beer it all ends up being pissed out in about 10mins anyways. But  what wasan issue is that they didn't bring out enough cups and when we asked it took them 10mins to finally bring out the extra cups that we needed. The same went for the table setting and plates .. All in all the food here is good but the services really spoiled the night for us. I expected more from Bj's esp being a big chian and all.
Cesar C.,Montebello  CA,56,39,14,6/19/2011,4.0,Very friendly staff!!! But the wait.......I am just going to stay quiet. :/ Our server was awesome very friendly.
Phil W.,Burbank  CA,189,307,37,6/7/2010,3.0,BJ's seems to do a lot of things fairly well  but nothing exceptionally well. I've been here several times now  and I've had their pizza  their calzones  and their chicken fingers. Everything manages to fall on the better side of average without really standing out too much. On my latest visit  I had the chicken fingers lunch special  which at $6 was a pretty good deal. It turned out to be better than I was expecting  and the selection of dipping sauces was a nice touch. The waiters are always very friendly here  and while it's not my favorite place to eat  it provides a good experience when everybody wants something a little different.
Suzy G.,Whittier  CA,77,157,84,1/5/2011,3.0,Love the food here  especially the lunch specials! It's a good price for a good portioned meal. Unfortunately  the service (for the most part) is pretty slow. The couple of awesome waiters I have had don't deserve a bad review. But really? How hard is it to have my drink filled and get me condiments like ketchup or a red pepper flakes for my pizza? i could be halfway through my meal (And I don't even eat that fast) and I could still be waiting for the stuff. And when it comes time to get the check  It's another long wait! Overall  can't come here for quick lunch...It's just not gonna happen!
Baback D.,Las Vegas  NV,1283,229,53,2/27/2008,1.0,ONE STAR! Horrible service  food  atmosphere. It's not even worth my time explaining the rating I gave it  never going back.
Matt M.,Monterey Park  CA,187,61,28,5/22/2010,2.0,How the hell do the appetizers get there before my beer?  I don't know what the plan is but for a brewhouse  MY BEER SHOULD GET THERE IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES!  And BJ's beers aren't all that great anyway.  The only saving grace was when they had some different beers on tap like Arrogant Bastard and such. Now they don't even have that. Stella? Seriously! That isn't even beer! If you are in the area and you want a good beer  ditch BJ's and go to 38 degrees in Alhambra. Food's just as good and the beers are 6.02 x 10^23 times better! Yes! I said it! 6.02 x 10^23! That's a mole!
Mel Z.,Cypress  CA,278,149,116,11/7/2010,3.0,Excellent pulled pork sandwiches! In general all their food is tasty and well prepared. Very clean place with a wonderful staff. Love their Blondie Beer =0) Will definitely come back here for lunch!
Judy a.,Ontario  CA,26,253,184,10/27/2010,4.0,Went here for lunch today  VERY busy  but the hostess tried to help and did  She took our order  I had bbq chicken and house salad. I must say it was very tasty. Will be back.
Denise S.,Pico Rivera  CA,119,60,60,10/26/2008,4.0,"Come for happy hour....well actually don\'t...because I LOVE it right now because out of all BJ\'s happy hours that I\'ve been to  this one is the least crowded! :) At first I was a little weary  since I always go the Brea location and personalized service since their bartender knows my fiance and I...and I did get a negative experience during my first visit  since they didn\'t have any brewhouse blonde on tap since they were ""out."" Anyways  I don\'t think half the crowd knows that BJ\'s is known for their great beer...since half the clientele kept asking for Coronas....yeah...I\'m not gonna stereotype the crowd...but literally  that\'s all I would hear around me is people complaining about how they didn\'t offer Coronas. I was like LAME---you come to a BREWHOUSE for BREWS!!! The other thing that BJ\'s is known for is Pizzookies! YUMMERS!!! They are so good  and everytime you buy the chocolate chip pizzookie  they give a little to charity :). Anyways...I had an awesome server named James a couple weeks ago...so go see him and when you do  tip him good because he\'s a sweetie and kept the glasses full! :) The Octoberfest brew is pretty good...so go try it before it\'s gone."
Dana B.,Rosemead  CA,25,35,15,10/17/2010,2.0,Very disappointing restaurant! The service was horrible  the food was cold! Maybe I went at a bad time but regardless of that it shouldn't get that bad! I will not be going back to this one. The manager seemed unprofessional and it wasn't a acceptable experience for me unfortunately!
Martin W.,Vallejo  CA,158,61,21,9/22/2010,4.0,Best buffalo wings. Great customer service and they had the game on the big screen!
Federico M.,Monterey Park  CA,0,9,10,5/22/2011,1.0,If I could give no stars I would. The service is pathetic. Been here a few times before and the service is always hit or miss but the last couple times it's been consistently horrible. Decided to give this place one last try. Server sat us at our table then never came back. Waited fifteen minutes and not even a drink order was taken. Walked out and never coming back. Sad sad sad place.
Mary S.,Carlsbad  CA,33,46,44,10/2/2008,5.0,This Brewhouse has good food  good beer  good drinks  good pizzookies. I have always enjoyed everything I've ordered so far... salads  sandwiches  pizza  soup  pasta  and the pizzookies are always delicious.The servers have always been kind and responsive  even during playoff times when the place is loud and busy.I don't know why everyone else seems to have a bad experience. I live in Montebello and probably eat here with my husband 2 - 3 times a month. The only other BJ's I've been to is in Burbank  so we were happy to have pizzookies close to home!
Margaret F.,Los Angeles  CA,644,430,74,8/31/2009,2.0,I ordered the open face meat loaf sandwich with masked potatoes and veggies. I personally love meat loaf but this one could of been better. Mind you this is the 2nd time I ordered this because i wanted to give BJ's a chance to prove themselves. Maybe i should have stuck to the pizza but I didn't. Food seems to lack flavor. Nice place to hang out but not too great for the taste buds!
Jazzy Q.,Montebello  CA,5,9,2,3/5/2013,5.0,right when I walked in i felt comfortable and welcomed. i was seated right away. the service was exceptional  the food was great and the staff was outstanding! Its a great place to dine for a special ocassion or just casually.
David W.,El Monte  CA,12,127,15,12/17/2007,1.0,"I came here with my staff from our Xmas party. It was nice that they were able to accommodate 18 of us without any problems. My order was horrible. I ordered the grilled salmon. I got charcoal salmon. It was very dry as well as ashy because they had seared it beyond edibility. Usually I love BJ\'s. I love the pizookie but this place really messed up my salmon. My brother also ordered the same dish and his was just as bad. It was horrible. The thing was that it was EVIDENT It was burnt and they still sent it out to us!!!12/20/2008I CAN""T BELIEVE I CAME BACK!!!! I got the Great White pizza and it was soggy. My friend got the Chicken Alfredo and said it was good but somehow my food always sucks at this location!!!!I can\'t believe they still served crap when they could blatantly see it."
Mina W.,Anaheim  CA,407,155,168,12/17/2007,3.0,"This place just opened a few months ago inside the (GHETTO-ASS) montebello mall. It\'s the only decent place to eat in the entire mall  so obviously it gets pretty craaaaaaaaazy during peak hours (last night was a 1.5 hour wait! so we bounced like bad checks).I went there again today during lunch b/c I had a free coupon for a pizookie. Luckily we got there before the lunchtime rush (11:40am) b/c by 12:30 it was utter madness! The party of 10 right next to our table got their orders messed up like 5x. One waitress was acting all rude like it was the customers fault. Luckily  my friend and I didn\'t encounter such problems  but the hectic craziness all around me was kinda stressing me out.  K  now on to the food: Their pizzas are decent  definately not the best. Stay away from the thin crust appetizer pizzas!! The crusts were soooo thin it felt like i was eating baked crackers with pesto dip. The pastas are mehhhh.. nothing to write home about. I\'d stick with the specialty pizzas and the appetizers. Also  they have special deals during lunch and happy hour if u wana save a buck or 2.   The highlight of the meal was definately the pizookie!! For those pizookie virgins out there.. its basically a ginormous cookie in a mini pizza pan with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Get the ""black and white"" which is 1/2 chocolate chunk 1/2 white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.. yummmm :]"
Bill E.,Orange  CA,95,164,21,10/6/2010,4.0,I am a fan of BJ's.... their food is consistent with some good choices. I like their deep dish BBQ chicken pizza as well as their standard wedge salad. I have been to this location on several occasions and it is always quick and good.
Jocelyn O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,242,33,2/15/2011,3.0,my experience was OKAY???nothing specialat the time i went i wasnt old enough to drinkand i really wanted to try the & beer sample.
Crystal H.,Pasadena  CA,1,20,3,6/11/2011,3.0,It's a tap pricey and the food is sub par. I feel BJ's has gone downhill in the last couple of years  it use to be a favorite spot for us to hang out at. Its right next to the mall so thats pretty convenient if you want to go shopping or watch a movie. You have to try the alfredo deep dish pizza  I ALWAYS get this when I come here.
Mark C.,Monterey Park  CA,2,352,,8/19/2012,3.0,Service was average to below. Food average. Atmosphere nice. Ordered the ribs. Sauce was too thick and sweet. Calimari good but sauces lacked. Ahi salad seemed good. Fish chips just ok. Lacked authentic British flavor. My mom had a birthday desert but the server forgot to bring any spoons. I had to go to the kitchen.
The D.,La Habra  CA,0,11,8,3/4/2011,1.0,Normally BJ's would get a higher rating. This one has no clue what they are doing. The servers are inexperienced and my order is ALWAYS wrong!!
Amy C.,Montebello  CA,0,7,5,2/15/2013,1.0,Let me tell u what poor customer service this place has !!! We went there for lunch and ordered pizza which took about 45 min to come out then it didn't look cooked so I told the waitress and she responded by saying yes it is and walked away WTF!!! We tried it and of course it wasn't cooked so I made them take it back and cook it some more  our waitress didn't even apologize like it was our fault!! Long story short they made a new pizza which took another 45 min to come out so we were already full off of our Salad still no apology!! I asked to speak to a manager and when she came by I don't know who was worse her or the waitress now I know where she gets her customer skills from!!!! Lets just say that's last time I will be going there and trust me there is nothing that I am missing out on except POOR customer service skills and SLOWWWWW service!!!!
Tiff L.,Anaheim  CA,8,141,12,9/2/2010,3.0,Sampler platter was goooood. Also had the great white and BJ's favorite pizzas. Decent prices since it was happy hour.
George G.,Los Angeles  CA,120,456,35,12/8/2009,1.0,Terrible  HORRIBLE service. Food was average. Anywhere where it looks like the girl spent more time on her eye makeup than on her serving skills is always a red flag. Requests for water and drink refills were ignored repeatedly. I'm kind of disappointed by this BJ's. I've been going to these for a couple of years  and nothing I've ever been to has been THIS bad.
Howard T.,Hacienda Heights  CA,242,322,74,5/8/2008,3.0,Decent food  though a little on the expensive side. I'll never come here for dinner. Very loud at night and most of the beer sucks. People mainly get the Blonde or Hef. You'll get better tasting beer at the Yardhouse. I usually go for lunch. They have a great deal on the half sandwich  fries  and a big bowl of chowder or chili for $8. Best thing on the menu...other than the ice cream and cookie....cant think of the name. This place hasn't been opened very long so at first the servers were slow and confused. Since then  they're slower and . They still mess up orders or take your order to the wrong table. What can you do? If you live around Montebello  then this is probably the only place to go to. Needs more improvement.**edit**went there again for lunch. service has improved greatly. bartenders are cool and take good care of you. +1
Anthony Y.,Rosemead  CA,348,59,4,9/9/2012,3.0,very casual atmosphere  but the pricing was rather high. the food had a lot of variety but the food was rather average since i started to not like the food i ordered after eating a quarter of it. overall  this is the kind of place i would go to if i would just stop by and eat with friends for a short while  just think of it that way.
Christine G.,Fremont  CA,82,24,16,7/18/2011,2.0,I am reviewing this place because of the TERRIBLE customer service! I came here to have dinner with a couple of friends a couple days ago on my bday and so we all made our orders. The waitress seemed very impatient and unfriendly in the beginning but I just ignored it because I didnt want it to ruin the night. THEN  when it came to the bill  we wanted to pay cash  and stated how much to charge on the ATM and CLEARLY told her to charge whats left over ($32) on my BJs gift card which had $50 in it. So she comes back with just a receipt for the ATM card and just hoped we forgot about the extra money on the gift card  until i mentioned it to her. So she came back with my card that still had money in it and she totally gave me an attitude and literally threw my confirmation receipt to me. Considering that shes not doing her job accurately  and that it was my bday  maybe some common sense would help!? I love BJ's but if you want good service AVOID this spot! Her name was NAOMI!!! Very unprofessional and rude! And btw i only gave a 2nd star because I love the pizza.
DALILA L.,South El Monte  CA,1,8,4,12/2/2010,5.0,I love this place if u go try the spicy spaghetti with shrimp its delicious. Have always received excellent service.
George K.,Los Angeles  CA,0,20,,1/29/2013,1.0,Bad service. Took 20 minutes for ketchup  additional 20 to get my food re heated via microwave. Service needs woek  spoke to manager that told me my waitress was working sick. Yea thats somebody I want handeling my food.
Kate R.,Alhambra  CA,3,3,,1/26/2011,4.0,Hands down the best resturant ive ever been too  my boyfriend took me here for one of our first dates  I love the food its freakin awesome  spinach artichoke dip and chips is like fireworks in your mouth I always get chicken fetticine alfredo and my bf gets the grilled chicken pasta. This location is always packed with people on weekends but I think its worth the wait  sometimes the waiters can be rude but im guessing there just rushed and there trying to do their job quickly as possible overall I would marry Bj's :D
Jess R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,19,1,6/22/2010,4.0,the food here is great the drinks are good i always get a little bit tipsy . ha! the customer services is great expect for this one time that the waiter was setting with us and was hurrying us to pay so he could get his tip and he took forever to give us our food other then that bad experience all the other times I've been here were great and everything was good
steve B.,Huntington Beach  CA,104,180,2,5/12/2009,3.0,Had Lunch with a coworker at BJ's today we only have so much time for lunch so let me state that first thing if you re in a hurry don't come here it will only piss you off  I don't expect much from franchise eateries as for the food I had their Field greens salad it was good fresh and hit the spot perfect lunch just not quick   BJ's is a great place when you have time to socialize relax drink beer so take it for what it is just don't be in a hurry! The moral of the story is eat  drink  be happy but if you're in a hurry don't come here.
Kristen V.,Los Angeles  CA,61,73,2,11/29/2009,4.0,I can regularly be found here at least 3 times a month. I used to frequent the Cerritos BJ's location but as soon as this one opened up  it was closer to home so I started to frequent it more often. I have never had any problem with the service  and just as any BJ's. . .the food is very tasty and the beer is even better when they haven't ran out of their seasonals!
Shaun M.,Benicia  CA,7,27,1,3/31/2010,4.0,BJ's is close to my office  but I can't eat gluten  so have never tried the pizza. Went for drinks after work one Friday and was shocked to see gluten-free beer Redbridge. Then was even more shocked to see they have gluten-free pizza. It's thin crust  and personal sized  so you don't have to buy a large pizza like most other places that have g-f pizza. And  almost all of the toppings are also gluten-free (I think the only exception was meatballs). I've wrote a more extensive review on my web site  plus other gluten-free reviews  web site is in my profile).
T Bird W.,San Jose  CA,234,280,38,12/19/2011,1.0,Worse customer service ever!! The server or servers ignored us the whole time  didn't bring us utensils  drinks  or even sauce we asked for. Its not like we were rude customers. Anyways I see why they have one of the lowest BJ's yelp ratings now.
cristian c.,Los Angeles  CA,9,9,,8/20/2009,3.0,"Their food is pretty good  i think their pizza and artichoke dip is on point. The waiters and waitresses seem really occupied and always running around. The drinks are decent and the seating is fairly fast. During a Laker\'s game it gets packed!!!!! but yeah BJ\'s is pretty cool....oh one day i went out with this girl...so we went to BJ\'s and we were talking..she says that she thinks that place is cool. I then said ""yeah i love BJ\'s"" ha ha so yeah funny moment there mates!"
Maritza C.,Montebello  CA,21,32,,3/22/2009,3.0,I love the Root Beer. The service is fine and they are friendly but the food is just ok. The food is average and nothing too memorable. The Chinese Chicken salad is a good choice or a chicken sandwich.
Brandon B.,Carson  CA,0,11,,7/31/2012,2.0,I come here around 2-4 times a month ( not my choice) and they have some okay service but today was the worst.  We get here at lunch time and the place is a bit empty and we are seated right away. From he time we sat took literally about 10-15 mins Neil a server approached. For drinks. I gave her drink orders and also my sons order because he as hungry. Roughly 5-10 mins later we got our drinks. So we then gave our order and she takes off. For almost 20 mins e don't see our ever and the hostess came over to get refills for us. About 10 mns after our server stops by and asks for refills. She takes off and another server delivers our appetizers. I get my soup and ask for crackers. 1 soup down nothing  they co e out and ask if I want more soup and I said yes and still no crackers. Our server appears with a spoon....why I don't know  she leaves they bring me my crackers  then the soup is delivered. At that time another server brings ur food. We eat  our server reappears  and asks for refills and take ps off.Well you know what  his just repeats n and on until we just to up and started walking out. For an empty restaurant the service was horrible.
Kenneth S.,Rosemead  CA,18,185,240,4/14/2011,3.0,came here one time for their pizza and it was too pricey compared to other authentic pizza places. it was good though.
Rosa C.,El Monte  CA,2,3,,8/23/2010,1.0,My first time and last coming here the worst service you could ever have..Not recommended I rather go eat at a fast food place better service and you sure would get your food quicker...They just seem to be all lost.
Lilly N.,Los Angeles  CA,48,218,42,9/17/2009,4.0,Love their food.. always comes out perfect.. I ordered to go perfect service nice friendly.. everything was good. if they were to mess up my order or what not they would give me a free drink.. pretty cool
Eric S.,Montebello  CA,21,73,110,11/15/2011,4.0,ive always been a fan of BJs. its a decently sized place within the montebello mall. the service is attentive  and there is a moderately sized bar area where there are plenty of TVs for sports fans. its a great place.
Richard M.,Montebello  CA,0,2,,6/14/2010,5.0,Great place to go had a lot of fun last friday. Good food and great drinks what u know about the nit-wit mmmmmm bomb-e
Kyle T.,Los Angeles  CA,13,33,1,12/15/2009,2.0,"So me and my girl got the ""california burger"" w/ the BJ special bread. Guess what? it was probably the most mediocre burger i have ever had. You know it is below average when they do not ask you ""how would you liked it cooked?"" anyway we also ordered with their thin cut french fries along w the potatoe wedges. These two set of fries tasted exactly like potatoes  no seasoning  nothing  very bland. So for the burgers and fries  do not get. The highlight was the plain ice tea  yeah thats how bad it was."
Nik N.,Los Angeles  CA,5,133,48,1/2/2010,1.0,The service is good but the food is way too salty! We had the bj's favorite and the buffalo chicken pizza and the clam chowder..that's 3 out of 3 tries and they were all a salty experience. :(
Carina K.,Arcadia  CA,0,1,,2/28/2012,2.0,This Bj's is definitely one of the worst I've ever been to. First off the service is hit or miss. I've had terrible service as in the waiter drops off the food and never checks back to refills our drinks  to very attentive friendly waiters. But the biggest issue for me is the quality of food. First off it seems that every time I go there's always something that goes wrong with my order. Every time I go I expect for my order to be screwed up. It falls in between asking for a side of Ranch Dressing multiple times  which isn't really a big deal  to them not topping an order of nachos with chili  the bottom of the plate was covered with it. When I flagged down a waiter and asked if that there was supposed to be more chilli the waiter with a straight faced confirmed that yes  that is how the dish is served and walked away without offering anymore assistance. Obviously  chili goes on top of the nachos  a fact they overlooked somehow. For a restaurant known for its pizza they served a Great White with marinara sauce and not white sauce. It wasn't until later that I realized what was wrong with that pizza. For some reason the food seems off. I don't know if its the inexperience kitchen staff or what but the taste of the food is different then from others I've been too. Due to these reasons and examples I have since refused to go to that Bj's. It has been a constant stream of mistakes that they don't catch or refuse to correct. It had gotten to the point where when I went I expected something to go wrong. Don't mistaken me  I have gone to other Bj's and have had the complete opposite experience. Maybe with time  and better management  this place will get better.
Bryant T.,Monterey Park  CA,665,19,365,7/15/2011,1.0,"Many reasons why i dislike this location. 1. I came on monday 7/11/11 and was turned away my i assume the manager because he was in a dress shirt telling me they had to close early because of an emergency  i look inside  PEOPLE WERE IN THERE EATING! if it was an emergency  wouldn\'t they have gotten people out? or at least offer me something like even a 1% off my next bill for my waste of time driving there? he didn\'t even say it all that nice either 2. so i decided to come back here yesterday night on wednesday 7/13/11 because i was still craving for the food and i had a card that gives me a free pazooki with a purchase of an entree. so i gave it to our server and she was okay with it. then comes back THE SAME MANAGER that turned us away on monday  came to our table and stated in a rude manner ""we cannot give you the pazooki  the card expired already"" and while he was saying that  he was already turning his back on us and walked off. did not even ask us if we still want to order it or anything else for desert. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS GUY GET FIRED for his terrible and rude customer service."
Megan J.,Alhambra  CA,0,71,,6/2/2011,4.0,This location is much less crowded than Puente Hills or West Covina  which automatically gives it an edge. I haven't tried too much off the menu  but the handful of things that I do order (grilled chicken pasta  crispy chicken sandwich  baked potato...) are always really good. I know everyone loves the Pizookies  but to be honest  I'm not really a fan. Somehow I feel like the cookie dough is not entirely cooked. It feels like I'm eating really hot raw cookie dough. Which might be good for those raw cookie dough fans out there. Overall it's a fun place to gather with a big group of hungry people.
Jose C.,Downey  CA,20,64,,2/3/2011,3.0,I have mixed feelings about this place. The service has been either super outstanding or really bad! During the lunch hour it has been really bad  but for after hours dinner or birthday celebrations the services has been really good. The assistant manager is super sweet and very nice! She made sure we got our food and service as quickly as possible. The food is good and the drinks are also good but I think because it is at a mall they are not as stiff or strong as they could be! It is a good place to eat if you have the patience and time to wait for your food! The waiters are cute and the waitresses are sexy as well. Nice place but I had better! Of course pizza is the best!
Ron M.,Montebello  CA,67,239,13,5/5/2008,2.0,I thought BJ's used to be a restaurant first and a bar second. Now it seems like it is a bar first and a restaurant second. The food here taste like it has been sitting under a heat lamp all day  the floors are dirty and tables take forever to get cleaned off. The service suck  except for the few servers that actually care about their job. Sad to say  but I will probably be back. I am sucker for a couple of pictures of Heff or blonde.
Marien P.,Los Angeles  CA,13,36,7,12/3/2008,2.0,I go to BJ's because it is a 5 minute drive & the Pizzookie is the best! But the service is horrible!!!!! I have been there 5 times & every single time the service is awful. I get seated rather quickly but to order drinks & food you literally have to flag someone down. The servers always seem to be preoccupied or just to busy to give you good service. I would give them a 5 star rating on food & drinks but the service SUCKS!
Andy s.,Los Angeles  CA,240,32,,2/16/2011,4.0,Jeremiah Red makes me happy. But when fall rolls around be sure to have a Pumpkin spice brew with a pizookie. you wont regret it!
Gabriella P.,Los Angeles  CA,5,31,3,6/4/2009,5.0,One night I was visiting my sister (who lives 5 minutes away from a BJs) and all of a sudden I was craving a Pizzookie. It was already 11PM and was almost dissapointed because I thought they were closed however  I went online and checked what time they were open til (thank god for technology!) and saw that they were still open for another hour. I went ahead and gave them a call to place my to-go order. Anyway...who gives about my story so here is my actual review:I went to pick up my pizzookie from the bar and the bartendar was nice enough to offer me a drink while I was waiting ( i ordered an iced tea to-go too) so I just asked for my drink and he gave me one in a glass cup and then gave me my to-go iced tea when I left too.  So 5-stars for their great service and yummy pizzookie. Most places start giving you attitude because you come in last minute and they are about to close...but this place was friendly about it!
Chili L.,San Marino  CA,129,182,16,12/18/2007,1.0,WTF? a BJ's at the ghetto mall this is a all time low!! whats next a Nordstrom?
Quinn M.,Long Beach  CA,38,192,2,7/10/2008,1.0,"This is an awful BJ\'s! We went for late lunch (2 pm) on a Wednesday. Sure  we didn\'t have to wait for a table since the place was nearly empty. But the service was horrendous! Our server announced from the beginning that he was new and his trainer would be watching to make sure he didn\'t mess up. I want to know what in the world was wrong with his trainer then because they were BOTH AWFUL!Offenses committed by new guy and his trainer:1. Assuring us the appetizer would be ""right out"" and then us waiting 15 minutes. 2. Not bringing plates or napkins for the appetizer. 3. Not bringing utensils for the salads.4. Handing us our utensils FROM BEHIND US OVER A COUNTER BECAUSE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO WALK AROUND!5. Forcing us to demand refills instead of noticing our loud straw slurpy noises when we were done6. Leaving empty cups and plates on the table when bringing refills7. Forcing us to tell him we were out of room and that he needed to take the empty stuff away.8. Taking frickin\' forever to bring things we asked for; it was later determined that his slowness was because he refused to take a trip out of the kitchen until he had supplied the requests of all three tables he was waiting. So if you were the first person to ask  you had to wait until the other two tables wanted something for him to go get it.9. Placing our drinks at the far end of the table  forcing us to pass them to the appropriate people (this was the trainer and this was done with cold calculation as she did not even lift her eyes).10. Not remembering that my friend didn\'t want croutons.11. Rounding the credit card split charges to the nearest dollar  resulting in one person from our party paying less than the other two.WHAT THE HELL? I have been to other BJ\'s locations during the evening rush and had really good service. This place is just awful. And since this guy was terrible under the direction of a so-called trainer  you can rest assured that future generations of servers at this location will be learning the wrong way to do their jobs."
vivian G.,Whittier  CA,46,2,2,3/14/2011,1.0,customer service sucks! the waitress was rude it took forever to get my food and when i finally got it i was wrong and on top of that when i askd to speak to a manager it took about 15min to get a hold of 1....i am officially never going back its a waste of time since they take for ever and a waste of money!!!!!!
James R.,Long Beach  CA,0,7,,9/3/2008,2.0,There is nothing to complain about the food or drinks served as they were actually pretty good. We had a departmental lunch party of 12 a while back  and needless to say from the other posting  the service is horrendous.We had to wait about 45 minutes before we were seated. The team was pretty much standing around the whole time as there were not enough seats for them. The only form of entertainment we had during that time were our conversations  the menu  and one of the BJ's employee who was pushing water out of the center of the waiting area with a big squeegee as it was raining pretty hard that day.We were planning on having a team luncheon that would last for about an hour or an hour and a half as some of us had meetings to attend to. So after we get our food  I pretty much had to wolf down my lunch so I could make my scheduled meeting which I had to reschedule by 30 minutes. Luckily  no one was upset.So bottom line  the food and drinks are good  but the service needs much improvement  especially for company team meetings.
michael t.,San Gabriel  CA,4,22,,3/26/2008,1.0,"I don\'t even want to give this place a one star. They deserve a .000001 star for just being open and employing idiots so that they aren\'t working at my other favorite restaurants. I have been twice and will never be going back  except to use my free $50.00 ""courtesy card"" that they tried to buy me off with that wasn\'t offered by the manager but instead when I had to waste more of my time to call corporate. The Manager there  Jay Kim was a total idiot and certainly not helpful at all. We were ignored by the service team for about 15 minutes after we sat down and were only helped by a server who was on her way out the door and noticed us sitting there like idiots. I then didn\'t receive my condiments for my pasta and pizza dish that my wife and I ordered for at least 10 minutes after the food arrived and by that time it was cold. BRRRRRR!!!!!!!!  I asked for the manager and there was not even an apology offered which was all we wanted. SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT!!!!!  He couldn\'t even do that  instead he said  ""my server didn\'t apologize?"" I was then super pissed and replied with  ""no i meant an apology from you  the manager""Very Long Story short...........I will not go back and I completely hate the service there and the management team for wasting my money and time."
