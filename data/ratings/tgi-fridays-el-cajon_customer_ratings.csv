199,Judy K.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,8,3.0,1.0,2012-01-22,"I actually like TGI Friday's. They aren't gourmet or anything, but for what they are, I appreciate them.  However this TGi sucks!! Honestly, the service is absolutely terrible. For the last 4 times I've been there, they've been awful. They're incredibly slow. Ridiculously slow. Oh yeah, did I mention they were slow? I've literally sat there for 2 1/2 hours when we only ordered an appetizer, a soup, and one meal. And the last time I went, I went with 3 other friends. We were taken to our table and then had to wait 25 min before our waitress took our drink orders, and then she rolled her eyes at us as she did it. We literally got up and walked out. What kind of crap is that? I mean, do you NOT want our business? None of us were rude or giving her a hard time, none of us even made weird comments. Nothing. I guess she just decided we were just an inconvenience. Never going back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=220,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.7640000000000002,2.16

251,Adam T.,"El Cajon, CA",1,13,,1.0,2012-01-30,I have never been so disappointed in my life! The time that we actually waited for our table was ridiculous. I ordered appetizers and they were brought to the table cold. Our waiter was never in the area and when we ordered our food it took another 45 minutes. It tasted like it was shoved in a microwave and left under a heating lamp. Overpriced food and drinks are what you can expect. One star for the bartenders and they're flaring tricks!

Started off promising at the bar (we had a 15 minute wait to be seated) as our drinks came out fast. Everything went downhill afterward.  Ordered a medium well cheeseburger. It came out well done. In fact everyone who ordered a burger...theirs also came out well done. Overall bland no taste burgers. Drink refills were slow. Some of my relatives drinks were also watered down (sailor and coke with basically 95% coke and ice with 5% sailor). My cousin ordered a burger with onion rings, and they gave him fries.  My fries, seems like they skimped me out with literally a hand full of them.  Ended the meal by waiting 20 minutes to get our check picked up.

Well, today had some papers to correct so I decided to kill two birds with one stone an have dinner and get some work done before I went home to RELAX.  I got a both with some light from a nearby window so I could see what I was doing. This place is just naturally dark, even in the middle of the day. The first couple of benches I passed had crumbs on them, so I passed on them but the third one was okay.  I ordered the Angus burger with cheese and the vanilla bean cheese cake for the $10 deal and a unlimited Iced Tea for $2.99. The burger was good and the Angus beef patty had good flavor. ( ) The bun however seemed a little on the old side. It was still edible but it did not have that fresh feeling. Overall, it was a good descent burger. Instead of fries, I had the mashed potatoes with cheese. ( ) The mashed potatoes were good. They were more on the lumpy side than silky. The cheese was very limited and I would not of known it was there if I did not see the few strands. The vanilla bean cheese cake was great for a chain. The presentation was actually pretty nice as well. ( )  The vanilla bean came through nicely and the graham cracker crust was super. I have to say, the cheese cake was the highlight of my meal.

I could swear all the food was heated in the microwave, even the French Fries, my Parmesan Crusted Chicken was Heated. burgers were really small sizes comparing with its price. I didn't like anything in this TGI Fridays, the prices were good, but for me i dont care about prices comparing with quality. The funniest thing, that we asked for the check, it took the server 20 min to get it, and after all that time it had a mistake, and just to be mentioned the Restaurant had only 3 tables or 4 occupied, so it wasn't that much busy.

They must have a master chef at their headquarters who thinks up creative spices, mixes, and sauces but since it is so unique you become hesitant to try anything on the menu. I like that they have a lot of Jack Daniels inspired burgers and sauces but I am not a huge bbq sauce fan.  We went in the early afternoon so the place wasn't very busy.

I call later to change the time because we would be late and it was still good. Then I called to change back a few but let them know what time to expect us knowing it's a surprise. We were running late but there were about 4 of us there and the rest of us were literally 7-8 minutes away, while the 4 that were there who could've been seated to our reservation were waiting, the hostess (brunette girl who's name i couldn't catch) was soo very rude to my guests who showed up and told them that if we dont show up, they're giving our table away. My friend let them know we were one street away (which we were at a redlight) and my friend was told by the other manager Frank, and the hostess that they're giving our table of 12 away with a ""too bad so sad"" attitude. When I show up, and let the hostess know we're all here, she was BEYOND rude and did not seem to care. I demanded to speak to the manager and Frank came by and i let him have it. He assured me that they were getting our new table together but we had to wait an additional half hour and the birthday girl showed up while we were still waiting!  WHAT A WASTE OF A SURPRISE!!!! after we were seated, our waiter was amazing and everything else went better, but the staff is not welcoming and seemed to be in hell than work....i know restaurant jobs are stressful, (ive had one) but if you hate it that much, (and show it) then get out because the customers see it and dont want to be in that kindof atmosphere, I've been to other TGI Friday's and they've all been amazing!!

The food itself is exactly what you would expect from a chain restaurant. It was nothing special, but it was not anything to write home about.

My GF had a sampler platter with something that looked and tasted like chicken McNuggets, the tiniest ribs you""ve ever seen, a salad and a side.  Nothing special and about enough to feed a bird. We tipped the waitress well and thanked here for her service but came away with the feeling we got the shake-down.  I don't know about the other TGI's but for this one the manager should be fired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=200,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.216,2.44

I went in with 3 of my friends last week, and unfortunately I had a waitress who sucked!! her name was Alisha, she was somewhat a short white girl with a snotty attitude. When I ordered an alcoholic drink she asked for my ID which I gladly gave it to her, than she tells me do I have another ID!! So I go digging in my purse for my PASSSPORT!! I didnt even want that to mess up my night so I was like what ever. She then brings my drink and I took a nice sip and what happens... it did not taste like there was any alcohol in it!! I know my drinks pretty well especially knew that drink very well because Ive had it so many times at other TGI Fridays. I then have to call her over and tell her about it, instead of saying sorry I can bring you another one she rudely says how Im wrong and that everything is measured out blahh blahh blahh, that she can add a shot to it which she will charge me!! To me this was complete bs, she was being so rude about it and basically calling me a lair. So I decide to order a different drink , this time the drink was perfect!! After that she seemed pist off that I told her about the drink, like as if she was the one who made the damn drink, which she is only a waitress so she should stay in her fkn line of serving!! Anywho, she then brings all of my friends their plates and of course she brings mine minutes later!! My food wasn't even warm when i got it!!! Not once did she stop by to check on us and see how we were doing.!! All in all this place sucks, because of the poorly way this waitress was to my friends and I. I do NOT recommend her service or this place!! save ur money and go elsewhere. We bought over $110 worth of food and drinks and left her a shitty tip of only 6 bucks. which not even that she deserved , her service just wasn't even worth a dime, next time she should change her attitude and maybe not be such a rude bitch to customers ! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=220,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.372,2.24

At Fridays, the food has always been consistently good and in past experiences the service has been awesome too.  My first time at the Rancho San Diego location was last night before an 8 p.m. movie.  The food was still awesome (love the spicy queso dip appetizer) - but our server must have been new and needed additional training.  We arrived just before 7 and I was seated right away while BF went to buy movie tickets across the parking lot for an 8:00 show -- it took our assigned server quite awhile to show up at the table.  I ordered drinks for both of us (we were trying to get a jump start on drinks and food before the movie).  I was asked for ID and was told I could not order a drink for my guest until he showed up.  I am almost 52 and my BF is 48 so this was irritating in and of itself (I informed the server when producing my ID that my BF is close to my age but she was clearly not buying it).  Then, when my BF showed up and the the server was not sure if she could serve us when he could not produce an ID (I drove), we almost got up and walked out.  She relented and said it was ""OK"", but then asked if we wanted our drinks (Captain and Cokes) ""on the rocks"".  I guess I kind of giggled and had to ask ""as opposed to what?""  I was then given an education and told that ""well it's a matter of preference really, a lot of people order them straight up"" - really? A LOT of people order rum and coke straight up?  LOL.  At end of meal, we had to keep asking for our check and reminding her we were on our way to movie and then, as we were walking out (we left cash sufficient for tab and tip), the server actually stopped taking another customer's order to tell us she had not run our card yet -- we politely informed her we didn't use a card, and that there was cash on the table - I swear she was going to ask us to wait so she could check to see if we had actually paid.  Anyway, loss of stars for sub-standard service, but perhaps we will return to see if this location can redeem itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=180,2.64,2.43,2.43,1.864,2.5140000000000002

We were patient  but 10mins and not even water or a hi how are you??? Really??? Went again tonight. Got potato skins. They were edible but terrible. As in I didn't  die after esting the nasty crap. After the skins coming out with unmelted cold cheese blobs on top we had them reheated. They came out again very similar, they were still the same skins too. No biggie but seriously? It was nice to be offered alternatives but our  schedule  was a tad limited as we had to get our kids.  My husband  also ordered specifically  nachos with no jalapeños  and still got them.  Seriously  the only reason we come is for the bar because  a long overdue  shout out is needed for Hector. Best flipping bartender in San Diego County.

We tried: Buffalo, cider glaze, miso and Memphis bbq for the boneless wings.   I liked the Buffalo and bbq.  The cider glaze tasted like cinnamon toast crunch.  Miso was an Asian type of taste.

We've been here a few times and have had good food but really terrible service. Every time it's worse than the last time. We went a few weeks ago for Monday night football and our waitress and a few others were to busy drinking and chatting with the bartender to provide any service. Tonight was the worst by far. It was 3:30 on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty. We walked in and told the hostess we would sit in the bar area. We sat in a booth in the bar area and a waitress came by to tell us that the booth is not open seating. She was going to check if someone was waiting. When she returned she told us next time we couldn't sit there because it's not self seating. Then she walked away. We left without ordering. It's one thing to get a lack of service, especially if the place is busy but to get reprimanded then ignored is not something I want to experience at a restaurant.

I have always had to flag down a waiter to get a drink refill and this past time the waiter kept making grunting sounds when asked for a refill. This on top of having to remind him each time what I was drinking (because lemonade is so hard to distinguish from other drinks.) This is also the slowest location I have ever been too. It takes them 2x - 3x longer then the other locations within SD county and there is always an excuse, even when they are not busy. I love TGIF, but I do not like this location.

She took our order at 6:53 and  we waited  30 minutes for the food. The food was good and delicious. But she never came to our table to ask if we need something and we really we need a lot of things. I asked to another server if she can helped us and she did it. So we didn't see Kristen our server for a long time trough she came to brought us the ticket. I'm  disappointed and I felt discriminated because she had 3 more tables and she didn't stop at any time to ask if we need something. My food was not free and I didn't hope it was I paid for it but the serves was really Horrible.

Another bartender takes our drink order, and then starts preparing drinks from the ticker. 10-15 minutes in. I get her attention and ask her to let the other bartender know that we're ready to order. She tells him, he says okay, and then continues his conversation with the couple he has been conversing with for now, the last 20 minutes. Again I get the other bartender's attention and ask for the check for my drink. She tells the asshole who's been ignoring us for, now 25 minutes. He walks to the register, prints the ticket, lays it on the bar in front of us and goes back to his conversation. Until today, I have never left less than 20% tip.

88,Ashley R.,"El Cajon, CA",0,8,,2.0,2016-09-06,"So to start out, usually my experience (I usually sit at the bar) is 4 - 5 stars. Now the reason for my 2 star review (only salvaged from a 1 star because of the wonderful Kevin and Hector from positive past experiences) is because of not one but 2 visits (in the last 4 days (yes that close together)).  The first visit was with my parents, we sat in the lounge area but not at the bar so that was our mistake. Our hostess served us more than our server that day. On average I'd say our server checked on us once every 20 - 30 minutes which would have been fine but our food took over 40 minutes and drinks didn't get refilled until the (third?) stop in by our server. It was really slow that day in the bar area...  The second visit (which is why I've given 2 stars despite coming in and having many positive experiences) was tonight and not only was I checked on infrequently (though not as bad as when I came in with my parents (I sat at the bar this time)) but I was also mis-charged. I believe part of it was because the bartender who was on was newer (I've never seen her bartending before) however the fact I was charged double for the food I ordered is why I'm posting this review. I don't know if this is going to be a norm for this restaurant as I was (up until this point) quite fond of coming here however the last two experiences are making me rethink if I ever want to come here again. I doubt management reads this however if they do I suggest looking over the training of your staff and following through with some type of test or random check to make sure they uphold standards because the standards here are more than slipping of late and at this point it is highly doubtful I will be back.  I'm sad to leave a review like this because honestly if I had posted 2 - 3 months ago it would be 4 - 5 star reviews across the board however the most recent visits have made me rethink where I spend my money. I won't say for sure I'll never be back (if only because of past experiences) but if I experience on more bad experience I can say I definitely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=120,1.96,2.06,2.06,2.216,2.02

Friday's seemed like a safe bet for decent food and a guarantee that the game would be on. When I pulled up to the parking lot, there were so few cars around I wondered if the place was even open. Well, it was - just with two or three tables of customers. I was a little worried about seeing so few people in a large chain like this, but decided to give it a try anyway. Besides, I had my pick of bar tables and the best screen right in front of me. I checked out some previous reviews and most of the negative reviews seemed situational and didn't discourage me.  I ordered a simple breakfast burrito and a strawberry margarita ($6.50 happy hour price). My wife got steak and eggs and bottomless mimosas ($10). The breakfast burrito came with brown sugared bacon and hash browns (got them on the side) and I chose tater tots as my side dish. It was $8 for the burrito dish and was actually really good. The tots were perfect - not greasy, had decent flavor and had good crunchy texture.  My wife's steak was a bit bland but nothing to really complain about.

The burger sliders are amazing the beef it self has this distinguished taste that confuses my taste buds and makes me happy lol , its the standard cheese burger with no othe sauces or dressings that will make the flavourless patty taste good .

135,Sarah H.,"Spring Valley, CA",35,18,1.0,1.0,2017-03-16,"This place was a favorite of mine years back but as time has went on, it keeps getting worse and worse. The last 2 times we went with friends, we were there for almost 2 hours each time. Not by choice mind you. That's how long it took to feed 3-4 people who weren't ordering much. Knowing how slow they have been lately, my family and I showed up for dinner at 4pm hoping to eat by 4:45-5. We had a time crunch and prayed they could hurry up. The place was pretty dead when we arrived and we asked to be seated at the bar area so we could get happy hour prices on the sliders and fries. It was myself, my boyfriend, our 3 year old, and baby. The waitress didn't even get to our table for 15 minutes. Once she got there, she apologized and asked what our drinks were. I let her know we were there for the $10 endless apps that have been advertised heavily during the TV commercial lately. She said she could get the menu but that it was a separate menu. Now the commercials state they are ""here to stay"" which indicates a permanent part of the menu. Why are they not in the menu I was given while I sat down? Anyways, she then goes on to let us know that 1 of the 2 fryers is broken so all of the food on the Endless Apps menu is going to take 25 minutes EACH to come out. My boyfriend asks her to just put in 2 orders for each of us at a time, that way we aren't waiting an hour for 2 appetizers a piece. She says no they can't do that on the endless apps. I was floored. She actually thought I had time to wait that long for our food. Their fryers were broken and instead of making an exception to the rule since it was their problem, they would rather have customers walk out. My family and I wasted over 20 minutes to get no food and have to get dinner at the drive through because at this point there was no time. I won't ever come spend my money here again.

After it was cooked it shriveled up in size and literally was like a bite size taste of lobster. For the amount of money that's paid for in addition I would expect a little bit bigger. But I guess what was I expecting to get quality from a franchise restaurant. If I wanted better I should had went somewhere else!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon,2.04,2.2,2.256,,2.136
120,Nani W.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,3,,1.0,2017-09-04,"The worst service ever. There were 5 of us and everyone but one got there food. The last person sat thru the whole meal without getting his food. When we were almost finished the waitress came to the table and said oh I didn't get your order in, it will just be another moment. Okay 10 minutes passed and all of us were done except the one didn't get his food and after ordering endless apps for 13.99 only getting two orders in because the forget you after you've eaten 2 orders, what a waste. Sure didn't think it was worth it. We asked for a manager and of course all she did was apologize. Gave us the missing meal for free and 20% off the bill, but the story doesn't end there the fries they gave us were cold and salty so the manager said she would get us hot fries with no salt that came when we were done with our burger. The strange thing was there were only about 6 other tables with customers. Not busy at all. It explains why there is only the TGIF in Rancho San Diego left. Wow what an experience. Disappointing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=60,2.0,2.17,2.24,,2.1020000000000003
31,Simon S.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,8.0,1.0,2017-09-18,"This T.G.I. Friday's location is one of the worst that I've visited. Let me start off by saying that right when I entered the restaurant felt like an ice box. It was uncomfortably cold. Second I went to use the restroom and wow I couldn't believe how dirty and disgusting it was. All over the floor there was pee, the toilet was clogged and there was no wax paper to put on the toilet seat. The food is hit or miss. You'll never know if your going to get a delicious meal or an upset stomach. I got an upset stomach. My sister came in with her own water because she can't drink the water they serve because it causes her to get a reaction to her skin. The manager felt that she can't have that water and that she needs to confiscate it and spill it out but we told her that my sister will stop drinking her water from her bottle. Are you kidding me your worried about someone bringing in water from outside but your not worried about your dirty restroom or disgusting food. What a joke. Folks save your money and go eat elsewhere. This place is terrible and not worth the money. Service is basic and food is low quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=20,2.0,2.16,2.24,,2.096

18,Joseph S.,"Alpine, CA",14,181,15.0,3.0,2017-09-26,"Wow! The reviews are tough. But, I certainly understand them. I loved this chain...I took my wife there (in New Orleans) just after I proposed. It was ""our spot"" so to speak. We've been there many times since we moved to SDiego, at Camino Del Rel (now closed) and we've tried this location in Rancho San Diego, but with sad results. The quality and quantity of the food was off-setting. Service was pretty good and the waitress was pleasant as well as attentive. No problem there. I guess we're going to have to find another ""spot"" to call our place because I don't see them lasting much longer either. Sorry to say that I was disappointed, because like I said, this chain has a special meaning for me. It would have been Popeyes Fried Chicken (my favorite) but she was dressed up too nice to take her there after the proposal, right?

2,Adam R.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-08,"If i could give it 0 stars i would at least for this visit. Im a regular and understand when its busy and when its not. I've reviewed this place before since 1. Ive had a hair in my food. The manager was informed by the waitress and i didnt request free food or discount or anything (shit happens).  2. We had a fly in our salad still alive wings full of dressing so it couldn't fly. Again i didnt complain but the manager cam up and apologized and tried to give us free stuff basically. No need we denied. (Shit happens). The reason for the bad review today..... Im fair and give credit when service is great but also when its bad. I visited today and service when busy is usually kinda slow. Sat in the bar area in a booth. Service was extra slow. I usually have 3,4 , sometimes 5 beers. My first beer came about 20 mins after i ordered it. 2nd beer was served and sat at the bar for over 10 mins. My waitress walked passed it and got other drinks next to it. I HATE HOT BEER. i finally got up and asked if that was mine since it had a glass of limes next to it ( not a lot of people asking for 5 lime per beer) that's the how i knew it was mine. Now i fully understand that im not the only customer and Sunday happy hour can get hectic. Im not an a self center a hole that needs to have a personal waitress at his disposal. When i was half way done with my second beer i asked my waitress to go ahead and start the order for my 3rd thus giving them enough time while i finish my second beer. The bartender came this time and brought me my beer to my table slammed it and spilt some on my table, and kindly said ""hope it was fast enough for you this time"". I can deal with slow, flies , and hair in my food is inevitable. (Shit happens). Being a smartass with a customer about not wanting my beer to sit and get hot for 10 plus minutes is not good. Won't return to this location again. Love Fridays and willing to drive further for better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon,2.24,2.19,2.26,,2.2100000000000004

The guy at the bar was rude af. He said a passport id didnt have a full description of you and that u cant drive with it. Last i check i didnt know your ability to drive had anything to do with your ability to drink! Plus he was being super condescending about the whole thing. If you're going to throwing facts about unacceptable ids, atleast get your facts straight and make some sense.

She told us about the half off appetizers so we ordered the beef sliders which were delicious. The one issue with our table was that there was no lighting.
