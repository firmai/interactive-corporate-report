(orange colored) ranch dressing that comes with the bacon raaaaaanch quesadilla.  what?!?!?   we were still hungry so we decided to order wings, one of my favorite things from chilis.  the wings were mushy and not crispy.  some of them were not even fully cooked through.   i wanted desert and figured that they could not mess that up.  i was wrong again.  my chocolate molten came out and did not have that crispy shell over the ice cream.  there was some runny chocolate syrup spread over the ice cream but definitely not a shell.   i am never ever ever coming back to this location.  something is wrong with the kitchen there.  someone needs to check it out for sure.  service was fine but the food sucks!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

In my opinion the best time is after 6pm and even though I stop drinking my husband and I prefer to sit ONLY at the bar if there's no room were not staying. why? for some reason sitting at the table nothing seems to go right or fast enough.

It was decent bar food. It filled my belly, and the BBQ sauce for the fries was nicely smoky. My complaint is related to the service. In addition to the food order mix up need above, my delayed soda refill was regular iced tea instead of the blackberry iced tea that I asked for. Also, the restaurant didn't seem that packed when my friend and I were there yet our order appeared to take awhile.

The ribs were not good at all. I'm not a chef and I could probably cook better ribs with my eyes closed. The sauce on the ribs tasted like sweet ketchup.

It was rather crowded at the bar, but a good kind of crowded. I always go with a group of people I know from Facebook and we always turn the place out. The bartenders know us and the waitresses are very attentive to us as well. For a crowded place (due to the sports games), it didn't even take an unusually long time to get our drinks and food. They even separated the tab for us. Unlike a lot of other restaurants that doesn't like to separate the bill when there's a large party. The vibe was nice, the food was fresh and CORRECT as we ordered, and my favorite team won the game. What more could you ask for?! The restroom was pretty clean and the manager even came over to check on us. Made us feel important lol..  Awesome spot for a weekday or weekend. Very laid back!

I eventually asked the manager to bring a cup of water for my five year old.  He brought it right away.  Our drinks came out after that.  By the time we were about 1/2 way done with our meal another waitress took over our table because the first waitress had to go home.  She asked could she refill our drinks. She took my cup and totally forgot to come back with it.  She also started socializing with other waiters/waitresses.  So...as good as the food was, I have to give two stars because socializing interfered with quality service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,1.512,2.6

They could have shit in my food and I would have had a better experience. I should have listened to all the warning signs not to come here but my gf was so persistent on eating Chilis that we decided to go to the closest one. Where do I begin, first we waited 30 minutes to be seated, which was expected in a weekend. Once we sat down, our waiter did not arrive to our table for a little over 20 minutes. Following those 20 minutes, the waiter did not bring my drink (and there were three of us) for about another 20 minutes, which he spilled in my brand new pair of Air Yeezys.  That alone was enough to piss me off. My sons food arrived first, 40 minutes later, our food arrives. And if u know kids after they are done eating, they get restless. When I get my food, half of what I ordered was missing. The waiter tells me ""they ran out of egg rolls when I went to grab ur food."" Why wasn't I informed about this so I could make a decision on whether I still wanted it or not? My food came with 2 sliders, the guy put both sliders on a regular burger bun and tells me that they ran out of mini burger buns. Wtf. Again, why wasn't I informed?

So definitely don't come here if you want a quick-ish meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

13,Moraine S.,"Miami, FL",80,74,187.0,2.0,2016-08-27,Came here after church for lunch and I don't think I too much like this Chili's location but my fiance claims it's better than the one in Aventura.......NOT TO ME........This is not the first time that I came here and they always seem to take time to seat you. When we finally got seated our waitress came and she was great. I hate that I can't remember her name but she was truly pleasant and attentive to our needs and made sure our drinks were filled and we were ok with everything we ordered. NOW........THE FOOD....... they either need a new cook or they're just slapping things from microwave to plate for you without making sure the food is hot. The steak was ok but my loaded mash looked stiff. The cheese didn't even melt on the mash and the bacon looked like bacon bits that they bought from the gas station.  Next time I'll drive past this Chili's to the one out of my way in Aventura. Find another location......not this one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
8,Rune L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",834,27,2.0,1.0,2016-12-10,"This place gave me the worst service I have ever had in my entire life, anywhere, at any restaurant - ever.  I have honestly contemplated calling corporate to complain about how terrible the service was here. Me and my girlfriend sat in the bar area and we waited for 20 MINUTES and no server came to our table to even ask us what we wanted to drink. That was strike 1. Then we went to the hostess stand ( where there was NO hostess) and waited for like 5 minutes. We were starving so decided to seat ourselves in another section. We sit in a section were there was obviously a server, and still another 10 minutes and nobody comes up to the table. They basically did not want our business. I went up to the manager and he was extremely unhelpful. He seemed annoyed by my complaint that we had been in this establishment for 30 minutes, switched tables, and still nobody asked us what we wanted to drink.  When I tell you I am talking to this man and he is barely even looking at me or acknowledging my existence, I am serious. I could not believe this was the manager. When we FINALLY got a server she was weird and gave us an attitude and said ""I was coming to you"" with this passive aggressive smile. We ordered asparagus fries. God awful. I write these harsh reviews because I feel bad for the owners who let other people run their business and then wonder why they are going bankrupt. The entire staff in this place needs to be fired and replaced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
6,Candy A.,"Silver Spring, MD",64,14,5.0,1.0,2016-12-21,"So I am visiting from D.C. And my family members brought me here to have a few drinks. I have honestly never been this upset about service. It took about 30 minutes for the server to get to us... and the serve was just s....l......o.....w......  we only ordered drinks, chips and salsa, and two appetizers for a party of four, and had to wait about 20 minutes in between each time we asked for something. They ran out of napkins, and the restrooms were also out of the necessary products (per the people I visited with). Our server was unapologetic, and it just seemed like maybe they weren't working towards tips?? Luckily my sister accompanied us, because she got up to get napkins, straws, and almost beat the server to our drinks at the bar because they were sitting there for about 10 minutes.  I hate to be b*tch about about it, and maybe I'm just used to the service up north. I don't know how people go to an establishment like this.  I hope the manager reads this, because I'm not from here but someone else may benefit from better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
11,Crystal M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",139,2,,2.0,2017-02-01,"I decided to come to this Chili's for a quick eat with my boyfriend at 1 o'clock. It wasn't busy so I got sat immediately but our server (Renecca) took about 10-15 minutes to greet us. Took her an even longer time taking our order. When we finally got our food is was cold, like c'mon now really? Thankfully, it was time molten cake! It didn't taste like the original at all and the ice cream had freezer burn. Now I had to speak with a manager. After hearing all that his words were ""my job is not to apologize, but it happened"" WHAT?! We left at 3 o'clock; two hours later for two entrees and a dessert. At least it wasn't filthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
7,Marta S.,"Miami, FL",0,11,1.0,4.0,2017-02-11,"My favorite go-to restaurant that's good on prices and flavor. My favorite deal is the 3 for $10. You get an appetizer, an entree of your choice from a list they provide you with, AND a dessert! Waiters are really nice, but because it gets busy quickly, they can get a little distracted sometimes. Just make sure to put your cup at the end of the table if you're ready for a refill. You won't even notice that they've looked at it when they're coming around with your next drink. Overall a good spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
4,Carlos K.,"Miami, FL",740,73,151.0,4.0,2017-05-22,Visited this location recently for lunch and I must say I had a very good experience. I ordered the half slab of ribs with street corn and they were both surprisingly good . The chicken quesadilla soup was as I expected and probably one of the better soups I've ever had . On my visit I was with my 2 year old daughter and everyone was extremely accommodating and I received constant service . Good food and attentive service is all I ask for and I received it .

5,Semaj D.,"Miami, FL",1,4,2.0,1.0,2017-09-12,"After hurricane Irma my coworkers and I went to chilis to eat, I understood days after the storm there would be some issues but the service I received was subpar. We ordered sodas only to find out the fountain soda were out so we had to pay for individual cans, something I feel the waitress should've mentioned upon ordering. My order margarita chicken and broccoli took an hour to some out, by the time I received my order everyone from my party had already finished their meal, but to make matters worst the broccoli had black spots over it ( not black pepper) so I mentioned it to the waitress and ask her if I could have my bill adjusted. She acted as if I was being unreasonable and I ask her would she eat this broccoli and her response was ""I don't eat here"". If a waitress at a restaurant refused to eat the food she's serving, that says a lot about the quality of service/food at this establishment. This will prob be my last time supporting this particular chilis establishment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
