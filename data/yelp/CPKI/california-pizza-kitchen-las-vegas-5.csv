Sean M.,"Las Vegas, NV",50,58,22,4.0,1/7/2011,It's not about an experience here it's about the food. Everything is virtually gourmet or can be made to your likings. The place is well lit enough and has a great atmosphere for bigger groups and families. We had a party of 7 and they accommodated us perfectly. No reservations and very professional staff awaits your visit. California Pizza is one of kind place to get your grub on.  For starters we tried the avocado club egg rolls and wanted to stop eating the rest of them but could not resist. Next we tried out their Thai pizza and it was delicious. Overall great food and had a good time with friends and family. The child was happy with his wood fired personal size pepperoni pizza as usual Good times!

Cindy W.,"Royse City, TX",8,203,59,4.0,4/25/2011,"I ate here for the first time recently and I thought the pizza was delish!  I liked the modern feel of this place and even though it was pretty busy, we were seated within 10 minutes.  Our server was pretty good, but could have been better so I knocked off half of a star.  I also knocked off half of a star because of the price.  I think the pizza is very good, but just wish it was cheaper.  I mean, c'mon the BLT pizza just had lettuce, one tomato slice on it some mayo and crumbled bacon on it.  I love bacon and BLT's and thought the pizza was good.  I also tried a small tiny piece of cheese pizza from my son's lunch and it was pretty good too.  All in all, I will go back but only when I am wanting to splurge a little on a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=20
Vitorio P.,"Las Vegas, NV",73,91,16,4.0,8/12/2013,"Great place to have fresh tasting salads prices are a bit extreme though. Two fish tacos for $12.00 amongst a few other small portioned things.

Dave N.,"Las Vegas, NV",849,434,210,2.0,3/31/2011,"Yeah, so I've become the douchebag with the iPhone. I've also become the even bigger douchebag with a ton of iPhone apps like Yelp. But since I am trying to be healthy, I also have the Eat This, Not That! App The other day, I was talking around Town Square with my Dad and he was really in the mood for CPK.  I decided that I could find something healthy using this app.  I'm not going to write reviews about the ambiance, or all that jazz. This is a CPK...if you are coming to Yelp to learn about CPK's then you need some serious help (er...Yelp). They have this ""Small Cravings"" menu which is a pathetic joke. Charging 5 bucks for 2 pieces of pita and a spoon of hummus? Are you fucking out of your mind? Yes, I am back to swearing in my reviews. This is lame. This isn't a small craving....its a giant fucking joke. Anyway....I am calm....I ordered the White Pizza. I remembered that although I needed something healthy, I had a long road trip through the desert and I had to keep food in my stomach. The pizza came out, and it was delicious. Thin crust. One downside...it was covered in grease, so I went ahead and de-greased it with a napkin. Once I took off 5 hospital surgeries worth of grease, I had my tasty pizza and was on my way. If you want something healthy...don't plan on eating here. Salads are a joke. Very few dishes are under 1000 calories. Only eat here if you know you need the calories for a road trip through the desert. Or if you want to be fat and have given up on your life. (Disclaimer....I am fat.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=20

( BTW  THE bathroom was discussing!). A TURN OFF RIGHT FROM THE START,  let me just say that I've been to CPK  multiple times and have always enjoyed. My husband ordered the thin crust artichoke pizza, delicious!  I ordered the crunchy vegetable salad with peanut dressing, really bad!

I sorta grew up with it.  Well okay since college, which still seems like forever.  A fusion of asian, american, italian...  It almost has something for everyone to enjoy. Last nite I had: Garlic Chicken pizza.  The garlic are roasted and a little sweet. Not oily.  I didn't have a bad garlic breath or any lingering throughout the nite.   The crab cakes came with 2 pieces.  In the center they have a salsa mix with beans, which is good together. I'm surely going to update this.  Service is great.  They have beers and specialty drinks.  So many memories of birthday dinners with friends.  Its just a nice casual spot to dine = 0) ENJOY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=20

Lauren G.,"Sacramento, CA",15,274,26,3.0,1/30/2013,"Food was decent. Service was terrible! The food was alright nothing too special. I have had pizza and salad and appetizers from here. Nothing has been mind blowing.  Where I have a problem was our server. She was terrible. She gave attitude when I ordered a water only. I had my kid with me. this means I will tip you extra because kids are a hassle. She got 8% for a tip. She took 22 minutes from the time she gave us menus to the time she got our order! 22 minutes!  I asked if they put raw egg in the Caesar dressing. She said ""well of course they put raw egg in it.""  It isn't well of course. I asked because it wasn't obvious. I then ordered an appetizer for my meal because I didn't want to wait another 20+ minutes for her to return. My meal was fine. Everyone else's meal was fine. The server asked me if I wanted to try a different drink besides water. When I'm more than halfway through my meal probably not. She was rude and hopefully I don't get her again.  Yes, I do remember her name but I don't want to put it on here. My meal was $11 plus tax so I gave her a dollar. Normally I would have given her at least $3.50, since my kid was there, but she didnt deserve the dollar I gave her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=20

EJay D.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,367,13,3.0,3/21/2010,I used to like CPK and it has been a while since I had their food. We came here on a Friday night and it was a 25 minute wait.  As soon as we were seated we started to order. The menu was huge. They added a lot of things to the menu since the old days when this CPK was just getting its start.  White corn guacamole and chips - very fresh flavorful appetizer. The corn was sweet and the avocado had a nice contrast to it.  Crispy Artichoke hearts - I love artichoke hearts but these were too breaded and  it lost the flavor of the artichokes. Blue crab cakes -  dense crab goodness but a bit too salty. The vegetables that came with it were awesome.  Mushroom ravioli - very solid dish. quite awesome.  Tiramisu and banana chocolate cake - very good desserts.  The service was alright. The food was above average. decent prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=20

I ordered some sort of pasta and the only thing I like about it was the shrimp.  All the pizza's are pretty standard. My nieces and nephews enjoyed them. The appetizers was pretty good as well.

I've been eating at CPK for about 9 years (started my addiction in the 6th grade when I was 12) and the food tastes the same. I don't eat here often, but I do like the: BBQ chicken pizza, BBQ chicken chopped salad, tequila chicken pasta, garlic cream fettucine with chicken, & hummus.

Linda S.,"Henderson, NV",1687,192,645,4.0,4/15/2013,"CPK is always a winner. I have never had a bad meal here. This Town Square location can get pretty crazy around high feeding time....be careful if you sit in their waiting area as the pony walls are designed for you to bang you head on when you lean back...ouch! You can expect such a successful franchise as this to have their system down which they do. Upon seating, we are greeted immediately with drink order requests. I love the mango iced tea and my wife enjoys the cranberry cooler...a drink she would order before they put it on the menu...cranberry juice, club soda and limes...all with free refills :) You now have to ask for bread as it is not automatically served. Salad, pizza or pasta? That is the question to ask when browsing the menu. Ok 3 words...Kung Pao Spaghetti...whaaat?! I love this dish and surprised other venues haven't copied it yet. Spicy, dark kung pao sauce tossed with spaghetti, green onions, peanuts and dried red peppers. CPK does Kung Pao spaghetti better than most Chinese restaurants do Kung Pao chicken. The bolognese is also very good and better than what I've tried at most Italian restaurants. The fusili with this meat sauce is all my daughter will order. Their thin crust margharita pizza is also another fave. Thin crispy crust with Italian tomatos, fresh mozzarella and basil...simple yet good. Their signature BBQ chicken pizza is also good with carmelized onion and sweet bbq sauce. Their salads are the best and usually the half portion is plenty for one. I like their Caesar salad with salmon pieces for lunch...quick and healthy. They also offer a small cravings menu that has things like a wedge salad, fresh iceberg lettuce wedge, blue cheese dressing (try it with their ranch dressing), bacon bits and chopped egg. The avocado corn dip with tortilla chips is great for sharing. Their latest special offered is the quinoa salad...a great choice for the vegetarian in your group and fills you up.  Whatever you order, CPK has found a way to make it, maybe not in the very best way but in a way that you will like it and come back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5
Emily R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1774,1649,10847,4.0,4/2/2012,"I had a gift card to CPK that was burning a hole in my pocket so we headed here for lunch. I've always have good experiences at this particular location. Service is extremely friendly and efficient. This is usually my deciding factor in how I review chain restaurants typically. The food is usually pretty standard but the service is what makes or breaks it for me. This place has the good in the service area.  The food, like I said, is pretty standard CPK faire. My favorites, and I usually stick to them when ordering, are the pear and gorgonzola pizza, bbq chicken salad and the veggie pizza. They have a small bites menu that I usually can't resist either. We went with the Korean tacos this time and they had a great punch of flavor and texture, so we'll be ordering those again next time we stop in.

Jessie B.,"Henderson, NV",75,776,124,4.0,3/28/2013,"Can I be a fan of California Pizza Kitchen, if I have never actually tried the pizza? I thought it over, and yes, yes I can. CPK may or may not do pizza well, but they definitely can put together a delicious salad!  I had gotten salads to go from this location a few times, but I have only eaten in one time... It was a beautiful spring day, so my lunch companion and I decided to sit on the patio. Sometimes service on patios can be spotty, I am happy to report that was not the case for us. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner, multiple members of staff stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed.  The caramelized peach salad is what we decided to share. I love that CPK offers the option of a full or half sized salad, the full with chicken added was plenty for us two. The cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese and walnuts were perfect compliments to the delicious peaches. To drink we each had flavored lemonades. The lemonade is fresh-squeezed, the fruit flavoring comes from a syrup though. Still refreshing and yummy, but worth mentioning.  Total damage was around $25. Not bad for a yummy and fairly healthy meal!! I will definitely be back, perhaps I will even try a pizza someday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5
Regina C.,"Henderson, NV",303,548,146,4.0,10/14/2012,"Ok, I am one to steer clear from chained restaurant...but hear me out. Twas a Friday and although I brought a delicious paleo lunch (salmon and veggies) with me to work, I decided to eat out with my co-workers, and that it was going to be my cheat meal.  We decided on CPK.   I started with the mango lemonade.  It said freshly squeezed on the menu, but I was very skeptical about that. It sure was yummy though.  Upon closer inspection of my glass, I noticed the pulp.  Maybe it was freshly squeezed somehow...I had two glasses total.  For my entree, I chose the chicken avocado eggrolls  There were a total of six halves, and they came with a ranch and the chipotle ranch sauce.  Both were creamy and delicious with these eggrolls.  They were very filling.  After two halves, i was satisfied. I also ordered a butter cake to go.  This butter cake taste like BUTTA!  As if it came right out of the Paula Deen's recipe book!  Oh so delicious.   I don't mind to go out for a drink here at CPK because I can keep ordering the yummy mango lemonade (free refills)...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5

We have one of these CPK's in Roseville but my first taste had to be in Las Vegas... hmm, to my delight the menu catered to many different taste buds! I thought that they only specialize in pizzas, silly me! Dined here with friends and everything was pleasant. Service was great! Fast even though the restaurant was packed by lunch time on a weekend!), location is just further south of the Strip and there is a parking garage in case side streets are full. One can compare this Las Vegas location to that of The Fountains in Roseville (less the parking garage).  I had the Carnitas Tacos (slow-roasted pork topped with housemade avocado salsa verde, red onions and cilantro)...  the meal came with two tacos, it was yummy but I could only finish one only because we had ordered the dim sum for appetizer, it's actually the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (Chinese dumplings topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Served with our soy-ginger chili sauce) mmmmmm!!!  The menu also came with a nutritional guide for those who are watching their calorie intake. Overall, very nice experience.

It was damn good. We ate them up and waited.  As we waited, our waitress offered free bread to the table next to us. Now this was my biggest gripe last time I was here, so we ordered something, only to find out they give bread away. FML. I got the same pasta [low fat zucchini and shrimp scampi] I had last time, it wasn't nearly as good. Apparently, must've been different chefs?  Shrimp came with the tails on it....drives me nuts and the tails/shell was soggie/soft, gross. Friend got a pizza and she ate it right up.

It's too hard for me to just sit back and not say what's on my mind.  So, I'm going to throw that cliche down the toilet like the rest of my food I ate here at California Pizza Kitchen. Facts: Miso Shrimp Salad - it was a mess. The combination of all the ingredients together did not compliment my pallet nor my stomach. Everything was mushy. My stomach couldn't hold the food down. Needless to say, I finally took Imodium to settle my stomach down. I literally was at the mercy of my toilet bowl all night on Monday. :/  Ingredients: Shredded Napa cabbage with fresh avocado, julienne cucumbers, daikon, edamame, carrots, red cabbage, green onions, cilantro, crispy rice noodles and crispy wontons tossed in a Miso dressing and topped with shrimp. Also available with chilled-grilled chicken instead of shrimp.

Vanessa C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1019,65,249,4.0,8/16/2011,"California Pizza kitchen was one of the first restaurants that my family and I started going to after we change our diet to a plant based lifestyle.  We always start with a bowl of the smashed pea and barley soup.. It's creamy and delicious. This is a vegan veggie broth based soup and I love that they also don't add any oil to the soup either.  I also modify the tri colore pizza salad. I ask for no cheese on the crust or on the salad , no dressing and add garbanzo beans, beets, and basil. I just ask for balsamic vinegar on the side.  My girls and I also love the grilled veggie salad as well as whole wheat pasta with a variety of veggies. They have plenty of vegan options for the whole family. I usually just look at the ingredients on other items on the menu and create the perfect plant based meal.  The wait staff is always happy to create what ever we like without one ounce of stink eye.

David S.,"Las Vegas, NV",570,1050,274,4.0,4/3/2011,"If there are two things I will not pretend to know jack about, they are pizza and burgers. The only thing I will attest to is what my taste buds like. California Pizza Kitchen is one of those places that some find as an atrocity to the art, but I opt for a different opinion.  It had been some time since I had visited a CPK, but after two years, I went there for dinner while on a trip to Disneyland. I had ordered the Moroccan chicken salad. It was so good, that I went back the next day, and have ordered it after coming back to Vegas. This salad is not your run of the mill greens, it is jammed pack with flavor and textures. Avocado, dates, roasted butternut squash, beets, carrots, dried cranberries, bell peppers, with a champagne vinaigrette dressing. With the blazon heatwave to come, I can see this being one of the dishes I will look forward to eating throughout summer. I am disappointed that they removed my favorite pizza, the Peking duck with hoisin sauce, but they still have the Japanese eggplant with goat cheese.   They offer the option to switch out the regular crust with a honey whole wheat. It is a little healthier, gives a natural sweetness, and balances out the saltiness of the goat cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5
Katie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,181,27,4.0,9/18/2011,"CPK has been a staple in my life since 1999 when I worked down the street from one in Palo Alto. Since then in have been addicted to the Chopped BBQ Chicken Salad. It's quite a pathetic addiction. So bad that I cannot bring myself to order ANYTHING else from the menu. Ever. We don't eat out a lot (amateur home chef here) so when we visit CPK I MUST enjoy my favorite. Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Salad Ingredients: Black Beans Jicama Tomatoes Fresh crunchy romaine and iceberg lettuce Corn Crunchy Tortilla Strips Cheese Perfect amount of creamy ranch style dressing BBQ Chicken pieces I love that the salad is not overloaded with dressing and they toss it so the dressing is perfectly distributed. As for other menu items, the Spinach Artichoke appetizer is excellent. My husband is a big fan of the Pear and Arugula Pizza and the Thai Chicken Pizza. I've tried both...yum. This location in the Town Square shopping center. It's always busy but the service is very good. You can dine on the patio, they have a special entrance for take out. It's fun to sit a the bar and watch the cooks making pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5
Brenda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",327,436,1241,4.0,7/26/2011,"This is a review for their salads only... I've been to CPK so many times that I can count all the times with one hand. Yes, that is how many times I come to CPK. In any case all of the times that I've been here (about 2 or 3 times) I've always ordered a salad. Yes, ordering a salad in a pizza joint is probably not the best idea, BUT CPK's salads are pretty awesome. I came here last week, because my friend and I met up for lunch. I looked at the menu online before I went so we could have more time to talk and catch up. I decided to get the Original Chopped Salad (turkey breast, salami, cheese, basil, tomatoes, etc)  with the dressing on the side, no beans added. I ordered the ""half"" portion and it was huge! Lettuce was fresh, easy to eat and tasty. I definitely need to come back here more often when I am in the mood for a tasty salad and I actually had to bring half of the salad with me it was that big! CPK is definitely a winner for the salad department. I've had the Chinese Chicken Salad too which was pretty good but the Original Chopped is my favorite! My friend had ordered their white pizza with NO bacon, but they brought it out with bacon. She tried eating it, but the bacon made it overly salty so they brought out a new one and they took off the price of the pizza entirely. Customer service was good and the manager even came over to apologize for the mistake. Overall, I will be back for a salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5
Napa S.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,15,8,5.0,2/5/2012,"I come to this place all the time.  My favorite is peach iced tea and I always order the wild mushroom pizza and Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.  I love the location because it is surrounding by wonderful shopping (at Town Center).  What better way to end a fun shopping day with friends?  The peach tea here has the best aroma.  Its the best I've ever had.  Just recently they added new items to their menu.  I strongly recommend the Habanero Carnitas Pizza.  It has slow-roasted pulled pork, red onions, cilantro pesto, mozzarella, and queso quasadilla cheese, with spicy habenaro salsa.  Its quickly becoming my new favorite.  I suggest you be careful with the sauce its super spicy.  That's it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5
Tanja L.,"Houston, TX",16,11,2,4.0,7/14/2011,"I would have to say this restaurant is one of my favorite to grab lunch at. The pizza is the perfect size for me at least, and I can't even finish the whole thing (only half), but it is delicious! I always get the Wild Mushroom Pizza and it is the most amazing pizza I have ever had. If you are a mushroom fan, this is one of the meals that you have to try. Our waitress and waiters are always friendly and are on top of their game ! I do not think there is one thing I can say bad about this place! I love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=40
Karen F.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,27,,4.0,3/2/2013,They have a wide variety of pizzas with numerous toppings. The two times I have been there I have not had a problem in getting a seat. The service is good and the ambience is more up scale than your average pizza place. If you are looking for a pretty good pizza place then CPK is the place for you!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=40
B W.,"Atlanta, GA",6,130,27,4.0,8/18/2010,"Idk if this is the one I ate at bc there were so many locations but this was on the stip, in one of the hotels, before you got down to the mall, if that helps at all.  Anyhow, I heart CPK anyhow so my review is stricly on service. Server was very attentive, along with management who came by to check on us as well. No complaints, and glad we got there when we did, bc no sooner than we sat down it started getting crowded. overall good experience, and if you eat spinach get the spinach dip. Also the BBQ, Jerk, And buffalo pizzas are the BEST!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=40

Lymophine C.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,113,20,5.0,9/10/2011,"I'm not a big fan of pizza, but I sure won't mind eating pizza there, I'd say SERVICE is their BEST part, the waiter is constantly being attentive at our table, nice and friendly and quick on the order, their BBQ pizza is awesome, also the desert too, a bit pricey but I totally don't mind it because of the superb service they give, totally worth it. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=40
Allison R.,"Las Vegas, NV",35,52,5,4.0,4/16/2008,"Overall I had a very good experience here at CPK.  The pizza was tasty, and my son's alfredo pasta was delicious.  Service was pretty good, a bit slow at first though.  Only downside is that it is a bit pricey for just a 12 inch pizza, $13.49 for a pepperoni, but I guess that is to be expected there.  The restaurant was very nice inside, I'll be going again very soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=40
Fern D.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,440,1,4.0,2/21/2008,"By far one of the nicest looking CPKs I've eaten at. Maybe because it's pretty new at the Town Square. The food was even better than other CPKs I've been to--especially the pasta. Usually, my expectations aren't that high for a CPK, but this time, they exceeded beyond my wildest imagination. The service was very friendly and attentive too. Definitely the location to go to in Vegas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=40
FoodCritic C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,50,1,5.0,11/14/2010,"OK, being a fan of NY pizza, I have to say this is a totally different experience. I love CPK, especially the garlic chicken pizza. The crust is amazing and the bread they bring to the table, I mean, I could just live on that bread and butta. :) Never had a bad experience at this place. Great service, awesome location. Perfect to do a little shopping and then recharge batteries with some carbs. Yeah baby!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=40
