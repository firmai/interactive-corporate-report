15,Richard M.,"Harwick, PA",15,2,,2.0,2014-08-20,"I like Chili's in general food, atmosphere etc but today eating with someone from work he ordered four tacos but there is only a 2or 3 taco option. Last visit the server didn't know what tortillas were. For shame, I think this is my last visit to this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
16,Brian G.,"Kingston, NY",2,8,,3.0,2014-09-09,"Always a friendly staff and a great place to come to watch a game or two. Bar is set up perfectly for sports. Boneless buffalo wings are great.  I could eat a pound of them. Spicy and hot, go perfect with an ice cold beer. Had the sirloin, which was my first steak in about 6 months. Couldn't finish it. Wasn't great, but wasn't bad. Just average and didn't leave me wanting more like other steaks I had locally at Long Horn. Overall, stick to the simple stuff and you can't lose. Leslie is a great bartender and always greets you with a smile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
13,Celeta S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",45,278,312.0,4.0,2014-09-26,Had a great time. Lunch with my Mom. the food was good and the service was friendly and efficient. They have machines on the table that allow you to order a second round of drinks or pay your check. The way technology is changing shouldn't apply to restaurants in this capacity. I also don't like the fact that if you play games on the machine you have to pay. Mealtime should be a time to talk not escape by using technology.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
10,Cora L.,"Creighton, PA",10,39,22.0,4.0,2014-11-12,"GUH! I love going here. I really love how great their service is. I really think it is quite genius how they have two servers assigned to one table is really great at times when your waiting around or if one server gets hung up on another table.  The food here is always on point. My only complaint is they use too much salt sometimes, which is easily fixed by simply requesting, ""less salt please."" They are always really great at accommodating and giving impeccable service. I'm sometimes not a fan of what I like to call, ""cookie cutter restaurants,"" but if your looking for consistently great service, good food, and kind staff this is a pleasant place to frequent. If your a control freak and want to guarantee yourself a suitable meal and experience I recommend chilli's.  Lets get down to business FOOD. The food here is always on point I recommend the guiltless chicken salad, chicken enchilada soup, fajitas, and pretty much anything on 2 for 20. I really like chipolte chicken crispers.   You ask for perks? If you sign up to be part of their email list they send free app, meals and dessert coupons on a regular basis. Also my kids get post card they get to fill out and send to themselves that have a free meal for their birthdays. I also love the kids eat free coupons.  I really love Their mixed drinks and margaritas are really good too. Nothing bad to say about chilli's only lose a star for being a franchise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
12,Taylor G.,"San Diego, CA",295,121,14.0,1.0,2015-06-08,"Food's ok but service is poor. I called in my order ahead, got there to find out the person who took the order saved a ticket with only my name (no food) so nothing was prepared. I had to re-order, wait 20 minutes, I decided to double check the order before leaving and good thing because we were missing 1/3 of the items. After all of the issues and extra time it took from my lunch break, the staff didn't offer anything for the trouble, no discount, future coupon, a drink while I waited, or an apology for the mix ups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
14,Scott M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,77,19.0,1.0,2015-09-13,"Don't know why I come to these places. Service was just horrible,our server had no personality and just didn't care at all. Food was just not very good! Way to much salt! I ordered the prime rib burrito and it was all tortilla! Hardly any meat in it plus it was just nasty. Probably the last time I will eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
9,Mandi A.,"North Apollo, PA",28,1,,2.0,2016-03-05,"Ordered Queso & guac... Queso was loaded with salt, the guac was under seasoned.  Entrees were fish tacos and a Ribeye and Fish Tacos...  Steak was overdone, fish tacos were cold.  The rice on the side of the tacos was hard and underdone.  On the plus side, our server was pleasant and the beer was cold....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
8,Marcia F.,"Russellton, PA",31,18,9.0,5.0,2016-03-05,"Wow ... This Chillis tops them all !!! ...  The food and service is always spot on and recently they did a fundraiser for our church's student ministry to Cambodia. They actually opened early just to make breakfast and then donated all the proceeds to the ministry for helping Cambodia orphans! Tony the manager came in himself at something like 5:00am and was planning on working another 10 hours after serving over 300 Breakfasts!! What an awesome group! Thanks Tony! Also, a special thanks to some of our favorite crew ... Julie Dawn Chrissy Ryan **** Chillis Corporate **** this is a feather in Corporate's hat!!!! All of the above personnel should be recognized by Chillis Corporate as the glue that holds things together! Thanks again guys! Keep up the awesome job!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
11,Lauren S.,"New Kensington, PA",54,38,20.0,4.0,2016-04-15,This is a place I  frequent. I really enjoy the food and the waiters there are super nice.  This visit I got the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla and a cup of chicken enchilada soup.  As usual I wasn't  disappointed! They had 2 big groups there from big businesses which made our food and service take longer than I liked but that's understandable.  They all kept busy and tried to take care of everyone's needs!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
7,Jessica W.,"Aliquippa, PA",41,54,7.0,5.0,2016-05-21,"I asked for a gluten free menu and was quickly provided with and guided through an app at my table's Ziosk that outlined an allergen menu. This app featured an extensive gluten free/wheat free menu with tons of delicious options!  Food was great, service was satisfactory; I will certainly keep this location in mind for a decent and safe gluten free dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
6,Joseph C.,"Grand Island, NY",0,6,,2.0,2017-03-29,Food was ok but service was terrible. Not enough staff to service the tables and I sat for 20 minutes waiting for a server to get my receipt. I ended up having to go find one. No check in after the meal was delivered and basic restaurant service was non existent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
3,Alisha L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",41,85,66.0,4.0,2017-05-11,"I had lunch at Chili's on a Tuesday and was quite pleased. The menu has changed and everything seems healthier and not so flavorful as I remember. Still worth the price. The music and atmosphere was great and chill, kid friendly, and clean. The customer service was great. I'd definitely return. I paid $8 for lunch and was filled. Lunches aren't big enough for too or even left overs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
5,Theresa P.,"New Kensington, PA",4,5,1.0,4.0,2017-06-14,"My husband just loves this place. We go at least once a week. They do have the best server in town, Julie. She's awesome. Their new flatbread chicken salad is quite delicious. I've had just about everything, except the burger. That's what my husband always gets, that or the ""big"" salad. The fajitas are another favorite of mine. Add chips and salsa and it's a great dinner and not too expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
4,Evelyn L.,"Natrona Heights, PA",0,3,,1.0,2017-06-14,"We had a horrible experience at this location tonight. 1.  We waited approximately 45 minutes for our food and it arrived COLD!  The French fries were soggy. 2.  When the manager came over, he said he was sorry and offered a dessert if we wanted. We requested new food !  It did come out hotter the second time 3 my daughter ordered frajitas, which usually come out sizzling. Guess what they didn't. She also had to ask for the sides ( lettuce, pico,etc) 4.  We also were seated near the kitchen. The ""F"" bombs, and BS this and that type of language coming out of the kitchen was totally unacceptable!! There was a young child sitting near us and I know her parents were not happy! You could also tell things were being thrown in the kitchen. They also had LOUD head banging music playing from the Kitchen, loud enough that you could make every word of the songs! Noticed the manager at numerous other tables while we were there, so I know it wasn't just us!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
1,Sherry M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",37,223,992.0,2.0,2017-10-29,"The worst chili's dinner I have ever had. It was an unpleasant dinner experience for the whole family. The service and the food was horrible.  The food may look good in the pictures, but it was not. The fajita was burnt and I didn't enjoy it at all. They didn't get the orders correct for any of us.  They crammed a family of 8 in the front of the restaurant. It was cramped and we had to have two separate tables away from each other.  We waited for an hour and a half for this horrible dinner.  I don't recommend this restaurant nor would I return to give them another opportunity to disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
2,William M.,"Valencia, PA",0,6,,2.0,2017-11-21,"I have been to a number of Chili's in the past and they do have decent food for the dollar. This particular location did not. We had three orders of fajitas, two with chicken and one with steak. All the chicken was under cooked and the shrimp in the one combo was very very chewy, almost like rubber. I would have liked to thought the server would have said something after seeing the chicken was untouched. Upon exiting the restaurant the manager(I think) did ask if everything was satisfactory which I responded no go look at our table. The response was ""sorry have a great evening"". Oh well, bad food, bad service = no return visit...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarentum,,,,,
