38,Duc L.,"Atlanta, GA",191,190,26.0,1.0,2012-05-22,"I hate to give establishments anything under 3 stars because I feel that if they try, then it should be so-so at best, but this place is just horrible.  I know better to stay away from Applebee's since my last visit which was over 2 years ago and never thought to come back but was over-ruled in a group of friends recently to dine here for a late dinner. The guys were really adamant on going here for half-off appetizers after 10pm.  We had a table of 7 which wait time was about what you would expect for a party that large. When we were sat, the waiter constantly forgot our drinks and failed to acknowledge a new member to the group who arrived a little late. We asked him for a drink twice for the new member, still no show after two attempts. Food arrived promptly after ordering which was one of the few positives I can say. When it came down to checks, we physically had to get our waiter to get our checks since he was in the corner talking to another coworker for about 15 minutes thinking he would notice all of us looking at him. The debacle with the credit cards, not getting it right, not printing out the signature slips with him was just a joke. We had to have a manager override his mistake to give us our signature slip for some reason.  Of course the guys who suggested to go here ordered appetizers all around which I've learned to stay clear from. So I ordered  the cowboy burger, some pink. Burger came a little too close being done than my liking. But the thing that bothered me was that it wasn't hot. It came out just a tad warmer than warm.  My friends ordered everything from nachos to the ultimate trio and some had hot wings also. So with everyone's orders, anything that involved melted cheese (mozzarella sticks, nacho cheese, spinach dip, etc) became hard within about 5 minutes. Mozzarella sticks are good, but when it re hardens before you have a chance to eat it, it becomes gross. I don't know if it's just the quality of the cheese or what, but I wouldn't eat that. The wings were skinny and I think the only appetizer that wasn't critiqued to the floor was the nachos.  I told myself I would not visit this restaurant, so never again. If you're in this area, just go to chili' or steak and shake across the street. It'll save you some disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=40,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

There weren't many people when we were at this location. However, we waited a very, very long time for our salads to come out. Gosh, were they trying to catch the chicken? Why make us wait 40 minutes for just our salads? We were so annoyed at the waiter who did not apologize for the long wait. Just as we were about to walk out the door, the waiter came out with our salads. We politely got back to our seats. I thought salads were pre-made and cut before hand.

We had to yell at each other to have a conversation. The bass on their sound system was cranked so high that it was making our seats bump and our heads ache.  Food - I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and my wife had chicken penne. They were both terrible. The burger was a frozen disc that had no seasoning. It was overcooked and frankly, the Burger King next door do it better and for way cheaper. The chicken penne was cold and the chicken was chewy. Not a good combo for chicken!  Waiter - Our waiter was good. He deserves a tip of the cap for having to serve such terrible food constantly. He kept our drinks full at all times and kept checking on us at regular intervals.  Time for lunch - It was almost 50 minutes by the time we entered this establishment and the time we paid and gladly left.

Well let me start off by saying this, I am a server and have been in the food industry for 8 years... with that being said this place was atrocious. First off our server Brittany was more worried about her cell phone and playing in the kitchen than to take the proper steps of service and make sure we were okay. I ordered my kids food with the app so that they didn't sit hungry. And what happened they sat, and sat, and sat. HORRIBLE! Once our app hit the table we were starving, but of course what did we find? a piece of fuzz in our food! We get Brittany's attention to tell her and she goes back to the kitchen and comes back and says that the kitchen staff said it was from the cleaning rags in the back! ARE U SERIOUS? so not only did you guys have a rag near my food but one you use to clean with that probably had product on it! Ehh! so of course our food comes out and about 10 mins after that the app hits the table. No management visit, no apologies, no nothing! then on top of that I have to flag the waitress down to get our check and they still had the app on the bill! Are you serious? This place SUCKS! I cannot believe that a corporate restaurant would have such low server standards as well as customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=60,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004
45,Peter K.,"Atlanta, GA",47,412,125.0,1.0,2013-07-19,"FALSE ADVERTISING Group: ""We'd like to order from the half-off appetizer menu."" Waitress: ""Is it 11 PM?"" Group: ""It's 10 PM. And the sign says it's from 10 PM till close."" Waitress: ""Well, at this location it starts at 11 PM."" Group: ""Then why do you have these signs throughout the restaurant?""

And you can experience it here at Applebee's On top of this horrible awakening of restaurant service here at Applebee's  along with a 30 minute wait to get seated and another 30 minute wait to order our food, we finally got to place orders. SERVICE: 0 stars. Wait... Yelp only allows you to give 1-5 stars. Yeah, I'm giving it 0 stars. The wait time to get seated, the wait time to order, and not bringing out a salad along with taking another 20 minutes to take our method of payment after you bring us the checks. Awful. Oh, not to mention not honoring the Happy Hour Half Off deal. FOOD: 1 star. I ordered a 7 ounce sirloin steak medium rare, and it came out medium well. By the time I got my food, I was hungry enough that plastic probably would have tasted just as good. The onion rings had way too much breading (probably 60% of it was breading) and the broccoli and mashed potatoes were pretty normal. AMBIANCE: It's a small restaurant that's packed in way too tight. There are very few aisles where you can have two people walk down it so it's just awkward when a waitress/waiter tries to get around you while you're trying to walk into or out of the restaurant. Oh, beware of the multitude of smokers just outside of the restaurant.

28,Renee K.,"Acworth, GA",204,162,47.0,3.0,2014-01-21,"Giant restaurant chains like Applebee's, O'Charley's, Chili's, etc are pretty linear when it comes to food and service. This place gets a solid a-okay. I met an old friend from high school here last night around 7pm. First off, I almost missed my turn because I didn't see the Applebee's sign soon enough and two, the actual sign on the building wasn't on, so I just saw a dark exterior. Not a deal breaker if you can navigate the crazy traffic on Pleasant Hill. Our server was very friendly and we chatted him for a minute. Unfortunately he couldn't super-size my sangria, but he was kind enough to fill it to the brim. Bless him. My friend and I were so busy catching up that we kept forgetting to look at the menu, but our server never rushed us.  We ordered the chips and salsa ($2.99) to nibble on while we chatted. I haven't been to Applebee's in years, so I don't remember their tortilla chips very well, but these chips were pretty greasy. A napkin was required for these chips. Nonetheless, they were crispy and handled the salsa nicely. Functionality ftw! I ordered the grilled shrimp and spinach salad because I'm trying to be healthy and all that jazz. I honestly wasn't too keen on eating salad when I saw they had a special on burgers and drafts that night, but willpower! I'm glad I stuck with my decision because the salad was very good! Fresh baby spinach leaves and perfectly grilled shrimp came together like white on rice. Like Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon rap battles. Like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting the Golden Globes. Like Chewy and Han in Star Wars. I somehow found the strength to save some for leftovers. I forgot what my friend ordered, but she picked at it all night. This place hasn't changed in years. The same booths, the same dim lighting, the same TVs and the pretty much the same food. This place has everything - steaks, burgers, salad, sandwiches, wraps, seafood, chicken dishes and pasta. They don't really have a ""signature"" item they're known for, so most of the food is mediocre and decent at best. Don't expect the food to knock your socks off.

56,Chris L.,"Atlanta, GA",82,47,,4.0,2014-12-20,"This is an Applebee's that's conveniently located off of I-85 Exit 104 (Pleasant Hill Road).  I came here for lunch with my dad and brother. My brother and I wound up getting the 2 for $20 deal. We each got two salads, which were generous portions, enough so that I couldn't finish it entirely before my main entrée came. We also split a sweet potato fries appetizer, which includes three unique and tasteful sauces.  I wound up getting the chicken fingers basket while the other two got a chicken penne pasta and a mushroom Swiss burger. Our food came out in a speedy manner, with all things considering, and our waitress was very attentive and filled our drinks without us waiting. The food was tasteful and enough so that my brother and I had to get small to-go boxes to bring the rest home. I would definitely come here again! A little slow in terms of getting the to-go boxes and too many screaming kids. I know that the second thing is something that Applebee's can't take care of, but then again, it does take away from the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.936,2.0

49,ChrisAnne S.,"South Elgin, IL",10,40,26.0,1.0,2015-02-18,"I could NOT wait to get home to write this review, so I will cut right to the chase. I had not been to this location in a few years because of the less than stellar service, but I was excited about their new Pub Menu so we thought we would give it a try. Big mistake.  DO NOT GO HERE! I literally just left the restaurant and this is what we experienced. Keep in mind, the store was NOT busy, even at lunch time so that should tell you something.  1. We did get seated immediately, but it took the server about 10 minutes to get to us. Once she took our drink order and left, (and about 5 minutes later) another waitress comes over and asks to take our order. We indicated our waitress had already been there, and we were still waiting. She seemed confused because it was supposed to be her table. Once we finally got our water about 5 more minutes after that, we ordered. I ordered the new brisket nachos and French Onion Soup and she got the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken. I asked that the waitress bring the soup and nachos out as my entrée. I really will not quibble about the food coming out together because there were more serious issues at hand. The soup was really the only decent thing - it wasn't piping hot, but it had a good flavor - lots of cheese and a generous portion of croutons.  The brisket nachos looked REALLY good and I decided to order them for a change. ( I usually get the fiesta lime chicken)  The meat was DISGUSTING. I absolutely love beef brisket, but this was shredded beef that looked like it was boiled in water then slopped in liquid cheese.  The texture was mushy, not fork tender like you would expect. It was horrible. It did not taste like brisket either- I can't even describe it. The chips and standard toppings on it were fine, so there is 1 star.  About 10 minutes after I got served, they brought my daughter's entrée out. They served it on one of those fajita plates and was extremely hot, the plate that is. The grilled veggies (onions and mushrooms, and I believe peppers)  were charred, nearly burnt. The aroma was not pleasant. My daughter and I each took a piece of shrimp off the chicken and ate - OMG. It was mushy and nearly raw. We both nearly gagged. Within minutes we were both queasy.  Not one time did our waitress come check on us. We had to ask the hostess to please get the manager. When he came over and we explained our dissatisfaction with the meal, he said we were wrong because he checked the temperature, and then proceeded to pull a blue thermometer out of his pocket and said, ""see? I checked the temperature it was ok and fully cooked."" I looked at him like he was out of his mind. I also let him know about how the nachos weren't good at all.  This is what pissed me off the most. The fact that he would want to argue, and it was an argument, about how we felt our experience and food was and basically just minimize our complaints was beyond me. He said he would take the chicken/shrimp off (chicken was not even touched) but we were made to pay for the nachos. I wish I would have taken a picture so you can see that the nachos were barely touched.  My daughter and I did indicate that we were a bit queasy, but he kept on saying it wasn't his product. It was.  He brought us the check and waited for me to give him payment. I paid- but only making sure I had a survey on my receipt because I am getting with Corporate on this one. He has no business being a manager.  On a side note, two business men came in about 5 minutes after we did and were in seated in the next booth. They waited a hellava lot longer than we did to even get a waitress to order a glass of water. When she finally showed up the guy came right out and said - FINALLY, it took you long enough, we have been here a long time, so we are already starting out badly. She giggled as she said, ""oh sorry"". So to recap, service was slow, food was disgusting, and the manager should not be one.  As we left the building and walked on to the parking lot, my daughter says ""Mom, I don't feel...."" and then proceeded to throw up everywhere. I hope they were quick to clean that up, because no one would walk into that restaurant ever again if they saw that.  Have a nice day!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.5720000000000003,1.96

My appetizer came at the same time as the entree and our waitress was interesting to say the least. It seemed as though she may have been a little tipsy. We actually saw her sit (yes sit) twice and talk to a man for so long we had to tell the host that we were ready to order so she could get her for us. When she made it over we were treated to a very unsolicited conversation about previous customers from days before (this was what prompted us to think she was a little loosey goosey). We had already waited too long to put in the order now we had to sit even longer while she shared these random stories with us. When the food came out another waiter brought it to us and we only received one set of silverware (I was not able to wipe my hands at any point during the meal). Worse service I've ever had.

She took all the plates, small plates, and then she took away everyone's water! Even the waters of the people STILL eating!! She wasn't giving refills because she put the utensils and trash into the cups. We didn't say we were even done or wanted our checks. She stood there at our table after giving out the checks and made us hurry up and give her our credit cards.

She then brings the checks and stands there waiting for us to tip her..... After we put the tips and signed the merchant copies, we gave her the copies and she left.

One of the mysteries of the ages is how this company stays in business. The other mystery is why people continue to eat there. Their new promotion has cost them tens of millions of dollars. Most of the restaurants now have wood-fired grills installed. It will simply add an extra step for the ex-Burger King chef to get that chicken breast a little bit smoky before it's slapped in the microwave and then sentenced to a slow death under the warming lamp while said high school chef heads outside to smoke a blunt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
19,Michelle F.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,5,,2.0,2016-11-12,"I gave this place two stars because of what it used to be. This review is not just based on this final visit but from the last two times that I visited this location hoping things would improve.  Maybe it's the time I visit but they always seem short staffed. The front is disorganized and unkempt. After waiting for five minutes and deciding to leave, the waitress came to our table. She was pleasant enough but seemed distracted. The food is not the quality it used to be. It seems as if the kitchen is taking a lot of short cuts. We had the 2 for 25.00 deal. I ordered the ribs with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The order came with an appetizer. The appetizer was brought out the same time as the food. The broccoli was overnuked and tasteless, the mashed potatoes tasted like dirt and the ribs were underwhelming.  Why the current manager of this once thriving restaurant would feel so complacent about poor reviews baffles me. Maybe he/she can ask the staff to clean the food stains off the blinds in the meantime while trying to figure out how to bring this restaurant back up to the standard it once was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
42,Kayla M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,1.0,2.0,2016-11-20,"This is by far the WORST experience I've had since coming here. We showed up at around 7:45, went to the hostess, she didn't look very happy that she had to do her job so she walked around to go find us a table and we got sat. Server came by and asked us what we'd like to drink, told him and didn't get our drinks till about 15 minutes later. We ordered our appetizer, and then our server came back 15 minutes later to ask us AGAIN what our appetizer was..like really?? So we give him our entree order, and then 10 minutes goes by and comes by our tables and asks us what we ordered??? ARE YOU JOKING!? I'm a waitress, and I would be SO appalled with myself if I was like this to my customers. I still stand by with my server family and I tipped my always 20% as always. But never should a waitress let their customers hang and keep waiting. I will be coming back, but not to have him serve me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6?start=20,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

My friend and I stood there for more then five minutes at the hostess stand before anyone acknowledged us. Crazy thing is, it was a slow night. Literally just walked out and was so turned off we decided not to eat here. Don't waste your time at this location.

Our server waited 15 minutes to come by the table and greet us. All the while he's checking on two other tables in our vicinity. How hard is it to take a drink order and check on your other two tables who are already eating?  He finally comes to the table and at that point my friend is pissed.  His whole demeanor was playful as if he thought we were all old pals. He cracked too many jokes for me. Can't you tell we're not in the mood for that? We quickly ordered food and drinks and the waiter  seemed to handle that fine. Our salads come out and he didn't check us on one time. Once our entrees came out he asked did we want to try the new grateful dead drink. I declined but my friend ordered one.  I had the cilantro lime chicken and switched the rice for fries. The chicken was seasoned well and was pretty juicy. I love the fries here. After my friend gave him the drink order, We watched him walk around and around the restaurant, chatting it up with all of his co-workers and other tables. Comes back 15 minutes later and asks how we're doing?! Ummm waiting on the drink! He says oh let me see what's taking so long. Dude you never put the order in!!! He comes back with the drink and tries to blame the bartender. I was so ready to go. Especially when he kept describing the drink as a grape popsicle. Smh.

12,Marie C.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",0,12,,1.0,2017-09-12,I went there last weekend. There was a bug in my drink. I exchanged it for another. Then I asked for cheddar cheese in my burger. They brought the burger with a different cheese. I ask for my cheddar cheese. The server came back like 20 minutes later to tell me that American cheese is there only one they have in Applebee's. By then my food was cold. I was so mad. I literally always come here and get cheddar every time. To make matters worse there was a roach crawling across the ceiling. They did nothing about it. I was a regular because it was close by and closes late but not anymore. Very disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

I recently heard about their new Topped Steak & Twisted Potatoes Menu. Sounded interesting. Oh I was in for a big surprise.   Our usual hangout is the Applebee's on Pleasant Hill Rd. in Duluth, Ga. Its in a great proximity to the movies and popular shopping outlets. I grew up in this area so its always like coming home.   This unique menu features a 6 ounce or 8 ounce USDA choice top sirloin. Only the cream of the crop for their customers. The options for toppers are mouthwatering. Tavern mushroom & onion, Savory herb & butter sauce and lastly creamy horseradish & gravy. But wait. There is so much more.    Things get real creative when it comes to the potatoes. The classic favorite is the garlic mashed potatoes. Live a little on the wild side with Twisted tots and loaded potato casserole. In addition to this, you have an option for vegetables.    A mountain of food weighed our table down. Savory herb & butter sirloin dazzled on a plate with a hearty side of twisted tots and grilled veggies. The aroma was intoxicating. I didn't think Applebee's was known for its steak. And what an impressive display it was.   My colleague chose a sirloin topped with Tavern mushrooms & onion. It was garnished with fresh broccoli and that tasty potato casserole. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor.    I was tempted to venture into dessert. I am absolutely in love with the triple chocolate meltdown. However, my stomach was well past capacity at the close of this evening. My friend was on the same page and was full too.   The price of these menu items is far lower than the value. Want more food for your bucks? Visit your neighborhood store for the Topped Steak & Twisted Potatoes! Kudos to Applebee's on an incredible promotion. We will be back!   #Applebees #ToppedSteaksandTwistedPotatoes #ashsaidit",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
2,Adalys S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-31,If I could give this place no stars I would! My sister in laws purse went missing. She called Apple Bees to see if it was there they told her it wasn't. Later on in the day they called her saying her purse was found but without the wallet. Not to mention there was $300 in her wallet. So she called the police but conveniently her section was out of sight from the cameras. So since there is nothing we can do I'm going to write this review because what happened was shady and this establishment sucks. Don't waste your time and if you do keep your things close to you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-duluth-6,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
