5,Jennifer R.,"Lawrence, KS",8,38,20.0,2.0,2014-06-07,"I've eaten at plenty of Applebees before, and this was some of the most disappointing service I've ever encountered. The odd thing was that our waitress was the only thing that contributed to the negative part of the experience. The hostesses, food (once the correct item was brought the our table), and atmosphere were all great. Her flippant behavior left such a bad taste in our mouths that this place gets a big ""thumbs down."" It's a chain, try to maintain your reputation with your waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-20,,,,,

6,Emily W.,"Columbia, MO",3,16,,5.0,2015-05-31,"Have always had a delightful experience at this Applebees, Last time I went I got the Philly and it wasn't good, the manager refunded it and gave me another meal, he was extremely nice and I will definitely be returning!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-20,,,,,
3,Merce'de S.,"Saint Louis, MO",53,63,2.0,2.0,2015-07-05,"The food is your regular Applebee's food, which I generally enjoy, but the service left much to be desired. I don't know the waitress's name, but she was clearly ready to be off shift and made no point to hide it. Considering I went on a slow Sunday and with a small group, but we waited far too long on our food. Then she only came by the table three times at most (including when she brought the check to us in a sauce covered check holder), and other staff members ended up clearing the table and checking on us.  The food was pretty good, but the low rating is for the poor service.  Next time I'll just go to a different location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-20,,,,,
2,John S.,"Clear Lake, IA",0,6,3.0,1.0,2016-09-20,"Avoid this place at all cost! We stopped in for lunch. I ordered the southwestern steak salad which looked nothing like the picture. The steak was very chewy. My daughter's salmon tasted very chemically. They brought her a piece of chicken didn't taste any better. The manager was nice and took it off the bill, but the food was really bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-20,,,,,
0,Kelsey A.,"Kansas City, MO",15,1,1.0,5.0,2017-03-10,"DO NOT TRUST JOHN S!!!! I am a Beez' expert and have been to this particular location MANY TIMES. The food is always of standard Applebees quality. The service is ALWAYS like the classic Sylvester Stalone movie. OVER THE TOP! Truly an outstanding group of young people who always provide great service. Tyler, our very nice server, hooked me up with the all you can  eat wings when I tried to order wings with fries on the side LIKE A FOOL. Instead Tyler came in clutch saving me money and getting me INFINITELY MORE WINGS. Also he was on those refills like his arms were MADE OF DRINKS. Thanks, Ty Guy. And, hey--don't worry about lunch tomorrrow, these portions are MAD generous. Truly, a spectacular Applebeez.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-columbia-20,,,,,
