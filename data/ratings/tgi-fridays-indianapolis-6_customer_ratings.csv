74,Police Lives Matter ..,"Greenville, SC",0,187,17.0,2.0,2012-05-30,"The restaurant is connected to my hotel and that is the ONLY reason I ate there more than once. The food is so-so. The Korean tacos had very little meat, the appetizer sampler with fried shrimp, chicken and ribs was over-cooked and the most of the ribs were left on the plate. I sat at the bar and only after I was ready to pay did the server ask how the food was. When told that the food was not good, they did not seem to care.  When a customer leaves half of the food on the plate, they need to ask why and then do whatever it takes to make it right. Managers need to walk through and check with customers, but this never happened. The servers at the bar were friendly but need training in customer satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6?start=80,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.768,1.7680000000000002

Service:  Probably average at this TGIF, though one time in England they had half the restaurant empty and refused to seat us because they had ""no room"".

44,Stacy P.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,718,370.0,2.0,2014-07-16,"One thing going for this T.G.I. Friday's is its location. It is located on the Courtyard/ Fairfield Inn & Suites side in cluster of Marriott properties, and if your staying here or visiting the White River State Park or Canal and don't wish to walk a few blocks, it can be one of the cheaper options when compared to the restaurants in the JW. This Friday's is one the larger size and its crowd seems to vary based on the conventions and other events downtown. Service here can vary extremely. I have had some of the best and some of the worst service here.  In terms of menu, they have most of the typical Friday's options. On the regular menu, they do now list what items can be altered to be gluten free, but I would highly stress your dietary needs and concerns with your server, although you may find that there might be some confusion. I would also recommend to verify what sauces that they use, especially soy sauce.  Also, they do list the fries as being gluten free; however, they don't have a dedicated fryer, so depending on your sensitivity, you should take this into account. Also, like many other restaurants, Friday's is a shared kitchen environment and there is a chance for cross contamination.  In terms of GF food, the choices are limited and kind of pricey for the quality of what you get.

36,Richard P.,"Indianapolis, IN",256,537,123.0,2.0,2015-02-12,"As I was leaving this downtown Indianapolis location of T.G.I. Friday's this afternoon after having joined a party of 9 other co-workers for a going away lunch for a peer, it occurred to me that perhaps my first mistake was visiting a T.G.I. Friday's on a Thursday.  This particular location has a built-in customer base being located in the midst of a cluster of Marriott hotel properties and within a block of several area museums, a baseball stadium, and other tourist attractions. As is true of nearly every T.G.I. Friday's I have ever been to, this particular location has the usual touristy/sports bar feeling to it with pop culture decorations and a number of televisions hung from ceilings around the restaurant. The usual T.G.I. Friday's decor remains in place here.  In terms of wheelchair friendliness, that entirely depends upon where you're coming from - if you're actually in one of the neighboring hotels, then the trip is relatively easy with well placed curb cuts. I will say that their two sets of glass doors are relatively heavy, and I was grateful for the employee who did arrive upon my entrance to help out.  If you're coming from anywhere other than the area hotels, you'll likely have to deal with sidewalks that are in a good condition but there's lots of heavy traffic around. So, it might be best to visit with a companion to ensure maximum safety.  One of my co-workers arrived at the restaurant early to make sure we got a table in a timely manner given that all of us were on our lunch hour. So, I will admit that when we all arrived several minutes later that I was a bit disappointed to see that no real effort had been made to arrange the tables appropriately. It only took a few more minutes, but it was an early indicator that the entire meal's pacing was going to be a tad off.  We all arrived and were seated at grouped together tables that accommodated us pretty well, though it was a bit chilly being near the front door. I did look around and noticed at least a couple areas of the restaurant that were clearly not wheelchair friendly, though I do give the staff credit for actually removing a chair for the spot my wheelchair needed. I ordered a classic cheeseburger that comes with seasoned fries. I ordered the burger medium-well and also ordered my usual unsweetened iced tea. They offer a few ""pairings"" offering lunch discounts, but none really struck my fancy.  Our drink orders were taken. They arrived a few minutes later. Again, it seemed a tad slow to me. The food arrived pretty much all at the same time, which I'm aware is practice but it seems to me backfired here.  What do I mean? The burger, which I'd say was medium rather than medium-well, was cold. I'm not kidding. It was actually cold, not even kind of warm. The bun, which had obviously been toasted, was also cold and bland tasting. I won't quite say it was all dreadful, but it was certainly massively disappointing. The lightly seasoned french fries would have likely been semi-decent if they hadn't also been right on the edge of being cold. The food tasted like they'd allowed it to sit out waiting while everyone else's meals were finishing up. I have no idea if that's what actually happened, but it sure tasted like it.  The iced tea was good, but they broke my cardinal rule by not offering a refill despite the fact that we clearly had down times and my glass was clearly empty. I always expect a refill offer, but that's especially true for a $2.99 drink. The process of getting the check also seemed to be just a tad slow. Jennifer, our server, was friendly but the whole atmosphere just seemed overly casual. You would think you'd be going for a decent tip with a group of 10, but our presence seemed like it was irrelevant.  Overall, I knocked off a star for the accessibility issues and I'm knocking off a star for the slower customer service and lack of an iced tea refill. The final star gets knocked off for serving up cold food. The final bill was just over $12 or so, and I definitely did not get my money's worth.  Indy's really growing in terms of quality restaurants, so unless you are stuck at the hotel with few dining options I can't think of a reason to venture over to this location of T.G.I. Friday's. I enjoyed spending the time with friends, but this won't be a place I plan to visit again unless I just happen to be in the area and am feeling too lazy to wheel a few blocks farther.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.704,2.12

But, it was below zero, so Friday's it is. I bet that's how many people make the choice to eat here. It's not really a place where you say ""You know what? Let's go to Friday's tonight!"" It's a place you go because it's there and a better place isn't.  It was busy due to a nearby convention. That said, I'd give the staff some slack. But I can't give them enough slack for how awful it was. We arrived to no greeting and met our friends who were already seated (we arrived late because parking was kind of nonexistent. Every attached garage but one was blocked off). We then waited roughly 20 minutes for our server to arrive to take a drink order and give our friends a refill. We ordered everything while we had her there. About 15 minutes later two of our four drinks were brought to the table. The other two arrived shortly after. Then, probably a half hour after ordering, three of our four meals arrived, leaving one in our party to stare at us as we gently picked at ours, waiting, hoping his would come.  The food was less that mediocre. And the price was higher than many better downtown restaurants. My chicken breast was small and dry. It was an a-cup in comparison to the menu photo's ""Gentleman, please welcome to the stage Crystal"" (Warrant's Cherry Pie blaring at the chicken strip club full of sad, single roosters) breast.  When the final plate arrived, the steak was overcooked and the plate looked like it had been thrown together.

I was left waiting for fifteen minutes while my boyfriend ate his meal. Once the correct sized order came to my table, I'd lost my appetite and desire to eat at TGI Friday's in the future.

38,Januarie Y.,"Indianapolis, IN",125,147,1073.0,2.0,2015-09-23,"Two stars....and the only reason it's not ONE star is because my sister didn't have the same problem as I did.  I don't like this place. Won't be back. The bread on my burger was old and they were in denial about it. I was offered new bread. And then I was offered nothing else. We were told our Yelp coupons were (and I quote) ""FRAUDULENT"" and were not to be used at that location because it was offered without their permission. The waitress also let us know this was an exclusive friday's location or something. I don't remember her describing word, but it was quite off. This is not an exclusive fridays and they don't deserve a capital ' f ', unless we're talking report cards. This place should be called ""Case of the Mondays"".  Because that's what it was. A big fat Monday with very old bread.  The manager was less than thrilled to address my concerns. Here's my thing:  If I'm paying you TWELVE DOLLARS to eat a cheeseburger (rather than purchasing my own hamburger and fixins for at home cooking), then I deserve for my bread not to feel like I could I break a concrete block with it. The bread was unnaturally hard on one side and soaked w/hamburger fixins-juice on the other. So I basically had what is usually an AMAZING cheeseburger served lukewarm (which I didn't even complain about) on half-n-half bread: Half soggy, half brick. The top bun was old as well. I know what old bread feels and tastes like. It has a different texture and thickness to it the older it gets (I""m speficially meaning hamburger buns). The bread also seemed much smaller than it usually is, or at least smaller than the buns I've had from ALL THE OTHER Friday's I've eaten this burger at. The fries were warm but not hot which meant they were cold and nasty quickly.  Clearly judging by how often I am checking in to a place to eat, I don't have a problem paying someone to cook for me. I do however have an issue w/serving me food that sucks and then looking at me like I should feel honored to eat it. When I told the manager the bread was the type of hard that signifies old bread, she looked at me straight faced and said 'that's not true, our bread is flown in from the South of France every morning'.  Ok I paraphrased it, but that might as well have been what she said and whatever stale face look you created in your head when you read that, is the stale face look she gave me. It reeked of 'I don't give a damn'. And she said that as if because they have bread come in the building daily, that means it can't be stale and old and hard. What reason do I have to spend my time playing with food? I came to eat, I did NOT come to complain, but I do want my food to be of quality.  I told her I didn't want it.  Her response: Ok. *Grabs plate and walks away*  And that was it. o.O ????  Yeah she comp'd the meal but no, she did not bother to say that. She didn't offer me a redo, which I was hungry enough to try it again. After all, I love Friday's and I love this particular burger. She just looked at me, grabbed the plate and walked off. The way she walked up to the table was the same nonchalantness of damns-not-given. I didn't know she was the manager and I definitely didn't think she was headed to our table w/such a lackadaisiscal demeanor. But she did...and as you can see, she stayed true to it.  Oh and how could I forget when I told the waitress my bread was hard as a brick, she asked if I wanted another bun. Another bun? A single bun? A single bottom piece of bun? LOL. No ma'am, I don't want a bun; I want a manager.  All in all, the best part of this trip was the knowledge that I will never again return to this place. It's quite dark and dreary inside and doesn't reflect all the work they put into beautifying the outside. So they can keep their Venice Italy-Flown In Brick Bread and their unconcerned management staff. Maybe they should take their mask off for Halloween and just be who they are: A Bad Case of the Mondays.

Where do they do that at? She wanted a freshly cooked burger. She only had a couple bites so it only seemed right to make another burger. The server got the manager who walked up to our table with no introduction or apology for the inconvenience and then stated that all bread is delivered daily. What does that mean? She snatched the plate and looked at me and said ""What's wrong with yours?"" I said nothing and she walked off whispering something to our server. She never came back. She didn't say what the resolution to the issue was. Nothing. Indianapolis has entirely too many restaurants to have to deal with mediocre service. I don't know why good service isn't part of the entire dining out experience. How do you expect people to come back?

We went to check for a timeframe and were told it would be about 30 minutes. It was after 5pm and they were not opening the bar area for people to sit. Excuse me? Okay, so we figured we'd go sit in the patio area outside. It was a nice enough evening and there was only one table seated out there. We were told that ""Ummmm...I mean, there are people who were here before you waiting for an outside seat."" Oh! Let me make sure I understand. So, you have 12 tables set up outside and only ONE is occupied. There are at least 3 empty tables inside that people could be sitting at but are not.

I would have been sympathetic for the waitress had the restaurant been busy because I know what it's like being a server, but the restaurant was fairly empty. She had not come back to our table until she saw that we were leaving. Definitely do not recommend stopping at this Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6,1.72,1.89,1.89,,1.822
7,M B.,"Seattle, WA",11,168,,1.0,2017-10-16,"Full disclosure: I doubt I'm the target audience for this restaurant. I came to this chain as a kid and haven't been in over a decade. It was steps from my hotel so I figured ""why not?""  Unfortunately I haven't been missing much. The low prices are pretty remarkable. I don't recall paying any more than I did 10+ years ago despite inflation. However, the food is much worse than I remembered as a kid. Could be adult vs teenager standards?  Low prices? Absolutely. Value for money? Maybe. Good food? Nope.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6,1.68,1.86,1.86,,1.7880000000000003
5,Gary J.,"Rock Hill, SC",14,49,35.0,2.0,2017-10-28,Ok it's TGIF and I know what to expect but this was a bad TGIF. We got in early to Fairfield so decided to grab a bite here since it's beside hotel lobby. The bread was stale on my French Dip and the sandwich was very small. They brought out our sandwiches without the fries? The waitress advised us the fries would be about in a few minutes. Never had that happen before. I finished my sandwich by the time the fries got there. Very disappointed in a$12 French dip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6,1.6,1.85,1.85,,1.7500000000000004
15,Rob M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,8,,1.0,2017-11-18,"Friday night, place was empty, asked to sit near tv's and they put us in a back room with a tv the size of a postage stamp.  Waited and waited for service & nobody came.  Finally left.  Awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6,1.6,1.84,1.84,,1.7440000000000004

We visited during the lunch hour and although their regular menu can be pricey for just lunch they do you have a limited lunch menu. This is what we ordered from, and although there are only two options you can get lunch for $8. This included your choice of either a side salad, Caesar salad, or mozzarella sticks and a half sandwich or macaroni and cheese. We also ordered the potato skins as an appetizer and these are pretty good. Although pricey for lunch at just a franchise but the customer service was pretty great, our waitress was attentive and super friendly. The kitchen staff who brought out the food was also very friendly and accommodating. The location is clean and updated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6,1.72,1.87,1.87,,1.8100000000000003
3,Jin S.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,59,1.0,3.0,2017-11-22,We went here for a work lunch a while ago. There aren't too many vegetarian options unfortunately. I asked for a quesadilla without chicken but was told that it couldn't be changed (it was premade I guess). I stuck to the blackbean burger which was delicious as were the seasoned fries. I want to give them 4 stars but was disappointed they couldn't accommodate someone with vegetarian needs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6,1.76,1.86,1.86,,1.8200000000000003
4,Lee M.,"Goshen, IN",0,29,,1.0,2017-12-02,"Went to Winter Lights and was staying at the Marriot. Didn't want anything big so went with appetizers. First I thought prices were high but it's downtown so what do you expect.  Anyway ordered Brussel Sprouts .    I know your not a fan but I am.  Figured they would at least cook them. Came to me hard as rocks after 2.6 minutes in a deep fryer. I complained to the waitress but she just hemmed & hawed and didn't offer relieve. Too tried to get into it so I let it go.  Hadn't been to a FRidays in a while , won't be back !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6,1.76,1.83,1.83,,1.8020000000000003
