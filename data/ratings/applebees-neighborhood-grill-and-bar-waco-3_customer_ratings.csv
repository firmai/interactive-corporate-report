35,Edie J.,"Waco, TX",1,29,,4.0,2012-05-23,This is the one and ONLY place I've been that can cook my steak the way I request it. The service is really dependent upon the waiter or waitress you get. It is hit and miss. There was one older woman who was terrible. I had to wait 15 minutes for her to bring me my check and then another 5 for her to bring it back.

The bartender finally arrives to the area, promptly takes care of the guy that came in after us- he orders a water with lemon. I thought this was OK because he may know him. So the bartender did not acknowledge our presence when he first came in the area,  the next act was most shocking. After serving the water he leaned his butt against a cooler and started a conversation with the guy. Totally ignoring us. We left. Applebee's seems to have a culture of ""I don't care"". Hiring people and training them not to care will not make this a better place. Hiring managers that care will make the most impact.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3?start=20,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003

I also want to mention we have a medical assistance dog, and they treated her like a queen! Provided water, and a ""snack"" for her, and made us feel very welcome.

We ordered an appetizer and a classic and two brunch burgers. All very good. However the appetizer was served with the entree. Asked for to go cups another 8 minutes it seemed. Then the check. Had to track him down by waving the bill and he smiled and said ""sorry they got me running here""   Let's see. About 10 or 12 people, an empty bar, lunch time and 3 servers. Stop and chat with two servers before coming for check. I would hate to see what it's like when really busy.

13,Mike L.,"Woodway, TX",0,1,,1.0,2016-02-26,"I don't really write reviews, but this was awful. I like Applebee's food, but hadn't been to this location yet. I walked in with my wife and 3 kids, and the employee acted like finding a table for five in a half-empty restaurant was going to be a chore. He said ""five, five, five... hmmmm"", and left for a few minutes before returning, and explaining this dilemma to his manager 'Jim'. The two proceeded to ignore my family while they talked to each other about another employee who wouldn't answer their phone and come in. Not the kind of chatter I'd expect them to have right in front of us... while we were waiting to just sit down. Eventually, manager 'Jim' waved at us (not bothering to otherwise acknowledge or greet us) and started walking us to our table. When we finally were seated, we placed our order. My wife and I were splitting a 2 for 20, which includes an appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer never came, and eventually the entrees showed up. We waited for a long time... drinks empty by now... to have a chance to tell the waitress we never received our appetizer. The waitress asked if we still wanted it, and we said yes. I also ordered another drink. Another long period of time passed... still no appetizer or drink. The waitress told us multiple times both were 'on their way'. Then, she told me the bartender had disappeared and she didn't know when I'd get my beer. I told her to cancel the order. She did, and promised the appetizer would be right up. Another 10 minutes or so, and waitress came back and asked if we still wanted the appetizer. I said, no please cancel it. She said she'd talk to her manager Jim to take it off the bill. She came back with the check, and the bill was HIGHER than it would have been with the appetizer. They had removed the '2 for 20' deal, charging for the two individual entrees, leading to a higher price. I explained that I wanted the price of the appetizer taken OFF the check, and that this actually added to the price. She promised Jim would get it fixed. This took 20 minutes. My family was miserable by this point, and went out to the car. Eventually, the waitress came back with the bill EXACTLY AS IT STARTED. They were charging me for the full '2 for 20' again. I tried to explain to the waitress that they should remove the cost of the individual appetizer from my bill. Manager Jim was 5 feet away in the corner by the register, clearly making a point not to make eye contact or acknowledge our table. I actually felt bad for our waitress. I think she was trying to help, and Jim was just refusing to let her. I ended up just paying the bill, rather than sending our poor waitress back to Jim again. Overall, a miserable experience. Sadly, I won't ever be returning to this location again until a big 'under new management' sign is hanging outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3,,,,,

8,Kris R.,"Hewitt, TX",0,91,14.0,4.0,2016-10-19,Been here 4+ times in last year. Each experience has been met with average service or slightly better . They took away the great Queso and chips whole family loved. The same can be said on food taste. Most entrees have been middle of road. Although they have some new items Grilled entrees that were quite tasty. I recommend to Daughter who went and thought so as well. Mixed Drinks can be hit or miss quality. Little to no alcohol. One recent experience upset me in that I am fed up with their tabletops. They need to be refinished they are getting nasty. Otherwise it is usually a pleasant dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
16,Silvia W.,"Waco, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-11-06,"Years ago this was one of our favorite restaurants until either they got bought out or something because their menu and taste went dramatically downhill . Last night we thought we would give it another go since it had been over a year and unfortunately discovered nothing has changed. My grilled chicken Caesar salad had no seasoning on the chicken. It was just plain grilled chicken over salad and croutons with a little Caesar dressing. Nothing special and certainly not worth the $10. My husband's nachos actually tasted sort of funny. When I took a bite of the ground beef by itself without any of the toppings I suspected it was actually spoiled. Another $10 wasted. Not to mention that the hostess seemed not to understand her job as she kept staring at us and not saying a word after welcoming us, until we suggested we might like to sit.  Won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
1,Paulette S.,"McGregor, TX",145,78,18.0,2.0,2017-01-29,"We have eaten at Applebees all across the US, have always enjoyed the food. We have noticed a decline in the qualty of food and portions. We realize that falls on coporate and say shame on them. Tonight it took almost 30 minutes for our meal to be served and they were salads! Mine was mostly white/yellow romaine and the portion was small, my husbands was served with his meat being over cooked and cold.  We did not notice a manger in house and the staff was gathered right by us and it's sad to hear them complain about the earlier shift. Just no management. Sad....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
6,Donna H.,"Waco, TX",12,6,,1.0,2017-04-05,"Went here at 6pm on a Wednesday and was told that it was going to be a 20-30 minute wait because ""they were in the middle of shift change and waiting for one more waitress to show up."" Who does a shift change in the middle of dinner time??? Applebee's needs to hire new management who will bust ass, bring in business (instead of B.S. like this), and have the ability to not only lead, but assist their employees! Better yet, tear down this poor excuse of a restaurant and build  a TGIFridays!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002

4,Ken L.,"Cleveland, TX",0,57,44.0,3.0,2017-05-16,Stopped in for lunch.  Food was great.  Service was also great. Had a wait person in training and she did a wonderful job.  Loved the spinach dip appetizer.  Seating was great. It was about 11:30ish so not a big crowd to contend with.  My only complaint is with Applebees decision to be ANTI GUN. They have chosen to not allow ANY licensed carry.  Because of this I will seriously consider not returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
3,Robert B.,"Harrisonburg, VA",0,13,3.0,2.0,2017-08-06,"We were in town for a meeting in Dallas, visitng Waco to see the Magnolia Market. We decided to eat hear on a Saturday evening the place is very grungy and the windows were so dirty you could barely see out of them, the waitress was very nice and she seated us at a booth, the table top was so sticky your arms would stick to it. We asked to be moved to another booth which she promptly did.........that one was just about as bad, the tables were so worn that they couldnt get them clean if they wanted to. The service and the food were good but i wouldnt recommend this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-waco-3,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
