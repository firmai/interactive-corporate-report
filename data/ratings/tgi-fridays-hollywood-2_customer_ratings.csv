58,Josie W.,"Hollywood, FL",3,97,,1.0,2012-08-20,"I was really disappointed with this location. The gentleman that seated us and the guy that brought our utensils were genuinely friendly and helpful but our main waitress and the two other waitresses that brought our food had bad attitudes and were very condescending in their service. It was obvious they didn't want to be there and didn't want to serve us. One of my dining companions ordered chicken which had to be sent back because it was noticeably undercooked, although our waitress tried to argue otherwise and again had an attitude about taking it back and bringing a new one.  The desserts were quite tasty but save yourself the bad service and go to a different location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=80,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

Let me explain why, shall I? 1. The appetizers. Oh, the appetizers.  I was starving so it was my idea to order the pick three whatever it's called. Pick three but you HAVE to pick boneless or traditional wings? We chose potstickers and loaded potato skins for the other two choices. I believe there are about five disappointing appetizers to chose from. The traditional wings were small. So were the potato skins. They were the children of Papa Potato! It seriously looked like they picked them before they were fully grown. The potstickers weren't small, but they were dry. There wasn't one winner on that awful plate. It was expensive too! 12 something!  2. The entrees.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp cajun pasta. Gross. The chicken was unacceptable. I felt sorry for that poor bird who had gone to waste. It didn't even taste like chicken. Maybe it wasn't? It had no flavor whatsoever but he pasta was covered in oil, of course. The only good thing about that dish were the 5 shrimps it came with.  Hubby ordered the bacon cheddar burger. The picture was enticing but looked nothing like it, unfortunately. The onion ring was shriveled up, the cheese looked dry, the bacon was burnt, and although the waitress asked ""pink or no pink"" and he clearly stated he wanted medium rare, that sucker was WELL WELL done. And the fries? Stale and flavorless. I wasn't surprised at this point.  3. The service.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine. Horrible waitresses that look like they not only hate their job, but life itself.  She had no personality, and looked annoyed to be taking our order. She hardly checked up on us and it took foreverrrrr to order!  Sorry, Fridays, but you are no longer one of our ""okay let's just settle for this"" restaurants. Bye bye PS...

Friday`s you and fantastic memories go hand-in-hand like two giddy school girls in pigtails skipping towards their favorite ice cream shop:   Parties of 15+ early twenty some-thing's, BFF's chattering aspirations of future ventures...   Sharing hopes and dreams and good laughs.  Servers singing ""Happy Birthday"" off key and out of tune.  And everyone thinking it was a hoot! Who cared if the service wasn't stellar? We never thought this was Barton G's. Just a decent place to get some food before heading out to the movies.  Besides, we were having a party!  Coming to T.G.I. Friday's one should not expect the type of service that you would get at a boutique or  high-end restaurant. Thinking this way will only lead to a bad experience as certainly much rests on expectations. The servers are green just getting their foot in the door before they move on to better things.  The service can often be slow, or too fast, or too pushy- or not pushy enough.. not quite on the money, but never overwhelmingly upsetting.   They aren't rude or smell funky.  They mean well, and aren't ever offensive.   The food is for the most part a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  There isn't anything horribly or extra special, just middle of the pack.  But they are open late night, they have drink specials, offer meal deals, there's enough space for a baby cart, the bathrooms are pretty clean and they have enough space for large LOUD PARTIES!  Sure you can go to a swanky club at SoBe and drop 3K on your B'day, but that's not everyone's price point.

40,Vick O.,"Hollywood, FL",135,51,153.0,1.0,2014-05-27,"I'm going to be brutally honest on this. First of all,  upon arrival, the host was no where to be found.  We waited a little long and all the servers or bartenders didn't even bother to welcome us let alone sit us down.  Just very poor management,  and lack of hospitality. The place had gone a new make over but I'm not feeling their new looks.  I prefer the way it was before.  When we were seated,  host told us the server will be right out shortly in a moody tone kind of brushing us off. He basically placed the menu and took off before we were even seated.  That's already several red flags and at this point we don't even feel like eating there anymore.   Server didn't come out shortly as promised.  We still had to wait longer. She took our drinks and also our food order since we use the time to figure out what we want.  Waiting time was decent.  When the food come,  I enjoyed it.  Surprisingly,  my steak came out the way I ordered.  Service wasn't that attentive though.  Plus,  my friend was waiting for a refill on his beverage which the server forgot after telling him she was going to get it.  Overall,  I was satisfied with everything BUT their poor customer service and bad management with the staff.  Especially the host.  If you're always in the back, how are you going to see and know when customers come. Unprofessional. Also if you're a host and wants to play with your phone texting your friends, at least do it in a slick manner. Don't have your phone out like you're on break. I will not be back.  I prefer ale house across the street.  Service is a lot  better there. In my opinion,  just a simple hi how are you is enough to acknowledge guests.  You won't get that kind of friendly service there.  At least with that particular host.  Vent done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=80,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

47,Steve N.,"Hollywood, FL",2,3,,1.0,2015-02-15,Fridays used to be the best but we were down to this location as the last good Fridays.  Today it joined the rest of them as substandard. I ordered takeout from there as we have many times in the past. When I got the food home the tostado nachos were completely charred black and just piled in the container on top of each other the condiment containers thrown in on top of the food. The mozzarella sticks were ice cold and the marinara sauce was cold too. When I drove all the way back to the restaurant to have them fix the order they apologized and brought a new order that again was just piled into a take out container.  I'm afraid that I will not be returning to TGI Friday's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=80,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.372,2.0

Lauderdale, and finally had someone take notice after nearly 10 minutes at the bar.  One bartender was too busy hitting on the women in the other side of the bar (who arrived well after I did), kitchen help was behind the bar getting himself something to drink. When I was finally served (I got ribs), I had to ask for ketchup for my fries, and wet wipes for my fingers. Worst restaurant customer service experience I've had in years.  I think I'll skip TGI Fridays in the future and go to Chilis or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40,2.04,2.04,2.04,2.536,2.04

49,Meli T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",35,5,,1.0,2015-04-06,"If I could give less than one star for this location, I would. I have been a customer of this particular location for over 12 years. I loved it so much to the point that even though I moved to Pompano Beach, I would still drive all the way to Hollywood for Fridays. My last 2 visits here were atrocious! Last night took the cake! I'd been celebrating my 30th birthday all weekend and wanted to end it with dinner at Fridays with my family. I should've left immediately after being seated. The Host(?) that seated us was awful. He did not speak a single word to us. When we were led to a table he simply pointed for us to sit. The table hadn't even been bused yet and the floor was covered with food underneath! He set our menus down (which is how we knew he REALLY was going to sit us there). My husband asked if he could please have someone clear the table and sweep the food off the floor. The guy rolled his eyes and moved us to a less dirty table. The prior patrons checks were still on the new table. The ""Host"" picked them up and we sat down. Luckily I keep some disinfectant wipes in my purse. No one cleaned the table so we did it ourselves. The waitress was inattentive. We had to ask for everything! Napkins, bleu cheese for our wings appetizers (we got the pick 3), utensils for my son, refill on my soda and water for my son, it was awful. When the plates came back for the appetizers, they actually had black, dirty water on them. My husband asked for new plates, which seemed to be an inconvenience. ""New"" plates came out, still slightly wet as if a rag had been passed over the top plate and had a particle of food on it. We asked another waitress passing by for new plates because these were still wet and dirty. This seemed like an inconvenience for her too. Again, the SAME plates were brought out. How do we know they were the same? Because the top plate had a distinct chip on it. It was the same chip in the same location all 3 times. The dinner was awful. My son had the chicken skewers with pita and broccoli (he LOVES broccoli). The chicken was somewhat edible. Broccoli was gross. It tasted very old. (When I saw my son wasn't enjoying his food like he usually does, my husband and I both tasted it) I had the JD ribeye with mashed potatoes and the tomato/mozzarella salad. The steak was tough and very salty, mashed potatoes were dry, and the tomatoes were waaayyyyyyyyyy over ripe. They were soft and wrinkled. I love caprese salad....this was gross. I took 3 bites of my steak, 2 bites of potatoes, 1 tomato,  and one mozzarella. I left most of my food on the plate. My husband had the JD full rack ribs. Let's just say he had to cover it in ketchup to be able to eat it! We asked for the manager and he removed the appetizer from our bill (the only  thing we actually ate!) We tipped because they have to make a living. We usually tip 20% or more depending on how happy we are with our service. They used to have a waitress named Andrea about 10 years ago who was amazing! We always tipped her 50% (on bills of $100+) because she was fantastic! The girl from last night got 13%....and that's only because it would round up our total to $60. I will never...EVER go to Fridays again. Not to ANY location! Food and service has deteriorated immensely!! Stay clear of them!!!!

The 2 of us were seated in a large booth but the table was so close on either side of the seat we had to squeeze in. I moved the table practically all the way to my abs (or what are supposed to be abs!) just so she could get in.  She is much shorter than I, so her boobs touched the table. I didn't want to complain since it was only my 2nd meeting with her, so I think we both pretended we were perfectly comfortable.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  My client ordered off their lunch menu- soup and fried shrimp.  I  had the black bean burger with mac n cheese instead of fries. The burger was topped with onions and sliced avocado.  It was tasty and the mac n cheese wasn't bad either.  When the food was delivered they brought out 2 burgers but I only ordered 1 so they took it back.   Our waitress presented our check and I rarely look at my bill but when I saw the total was $30+ for 2 lunches and water, I was a little suspicious. I was charged for the 2 burgers. I brought it to her attention and it was quickly rectified.

Once we were seated, we waited... & waited... until eventually we flagged down a server. One of the guys in our party decided he was going to order to-go in the hopes he could get his food quicker. The waitress laughed & told him that it would make no difference as all of our orders were being placed at the same time.  Fast forward 25 minutes later when his food was given to him. He had ordered quite a bit of food & yet it was here & ready. We wait... & wait some more... one full hour after he had eaten his meal(he graciously shared with us as we sat starving) our food started to trickle in. With my luck, my order was wrong & I had to wait even longer for it to be replaced. After quite an extensive search, we were able to locate the manager on duty to explain the horrendous situation. We were told the order had been placed in the system wrong which caused the delay. I don't know whether this was the case but we took her word for it.  The manager brought a free dessert for our friends birthday & gave us a small break on the check which was a nice gesture.

Heck, go out and buy a lottery ticket because you must be one in a million.  I told the server the burger was horrible. His response was, ""Good to know.""  Duncan, I'm sorry you obviously don't care about your job and that's fine with me.  Can I have a different server then?  This was honestly the worst hamburger I've had. It's the type of hamburger that makes Burger King taste gourmet. My dinner companion took a bite and told me he thought it was ""disgusting.""  He said, ""It almost ruined burgers for me, completely.""  I could barely eat 1/2 of it.  Michelle stopped by and did her best to make it right. I appreciate her honesty and sincerity. Apparently Duncan is new. I'll chalk it up to a learning opportunity; however, I wouldn't come back.

She basically told me the kitchen was closed and nothing they can do. I went back tonight and Vinny was super helpful. I told him the issue and he took my receipt to head towards the back. In less than a minute he came out and said wait 10-15 minutes for your ribs. Within 10 minutes he saw I was waiting and automatically went to check. He then immediately came back out with my ribs and fries were now added. It was such an inconvenience to have to go back to Friday's but glad I was helped by Vinny.
