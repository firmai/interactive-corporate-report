20,Aubrey S.,"Worcester, MA",4,94,49.0,1.0,2012-01-25,I recently went here for drinks and dessert and was disappointed. I got the Oreo madness and lets just say the only thing mad about it was myself for ordering such a cheaply made dessert. It was one of those frozen Oreo ice cream cookies you can buy at convenience stores for like 1.50$. What a joke. Of course they charged 5.79$ for it too. A complete disappointment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=60,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

They have no entrees for vegetarians and, frankly, not much more than a smattering of so-so sandwiches and overpriced meals.  To top it off, they screwed up our order, bringing one diner's meal well after the rest of us had finished.  At least they comped us on that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=40,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

My husband and I went here tonight for dinner and decided to sit at the bar to watch the football game. The bartender, Lindsay, gave us our menus as soon as we sat down, but didn't come back for our drink order for 5 minutes. She brought my beer and walked away. A few minutes later she came over and my husband asked for his and she stated "" you never told me what you wanted."" . No admitting she forgot..We asked for second drinks and she obliged by taking our glasses and not coming back. We had to ask her two more times before receiving our drinks.

25,Heather Z.,"Auburn, MA",18,7,,1.0,2014-01-05,"I usually do not have to go online and read reviews for ""chain"" or ""franchise"" restaurants.  I would expect them to have a strict training regime and would anticipate the same service, food etc. at each location. Not EXACT, but similar.   No matter where it be.  Well, it was a rainy Sunday early-evening.  We decided to pop in for a quick bite and continue on our way home.        Upon arriving we did notice that it looked somewhat busier than normal.  Understandable due to the time of year.  We walked in and stood waiting for a good three minutes before even seeing someone in eye-shot of the reception desk.  ""Odd,"" I thought. ""There are two people waiting, a lot of empty tables, but no one is seating guests.""        Then, around the corner came two young girls.  They both appeared to be training each other, on their first day.  They still, did not say a word to us.  Then, appeared The Chef, of all people and noticed that we hadn't been acknowledged and made a point to mention to the girls that we were waiting to be seated.  (Thanks, Chef)  Without saying a word, two menus were picked up and the greeter started walking away.        Unsure if she was seating us or the other couple, they gave us a nod and we began to follow.  She started walking into the bar area and we requested that we sit in the dining section. (Don't you think I would have seated myself if I wanted to sit near the bar)  Anyhoot, we were seated, FINALLY!! Let's grub.        More waiting.  Ok, I get it, it's busy, so whatever.  We just got two sodas.  Good thing.  The people that were seated adjacent to us waited OVER 10 min for their drinks.  Their apps came out almost immediately after they arrived.         While sitting and waiting for our orders we enjoy watching people.  Happened to notice quite a bit of food being brought back to the kitchen.  Considering we were seated right there, it was fairly noticeable.  I am unsure if it was due to lack of quality or not knowing where the plate was going to, but either way, it didn't look very good.      Ordered:     The quantity of the food was good, quality varied       *HM bnls Chkn bites- were good However, due to the fact that we requested HM rather than the normal buffalo, it arrived with extra HM (points for that) and celery.  BAD move!! Although they were a great size, they were not any good.  One stalk was so dried out, the end of it was split into four curly ends on one side.  And two of the other three were covered in brown soft spots.  Ewww... *Potato Skins- Cold, not much else to say about that *Pretzels- BURNT disappointing, the cheese sauce was DELISH.  Nice job *Pork tacos,didn't try *Brushetta- outstanding!! Unless you are not a big fan of garlic.  I absolutely LOVE garlic.  So the over abundance in this plate was not a problem for me.  And the balsamic reduction glaze....OH MY I have to create that!!  Perfect *Bacon Mac & cheese bites-eh, nothing fabulous.  Was expecting bacon INSIDE of the bites, rather than small strips on the top of the dish *Philly CheeseSteak Stack Burger- To begin, this was the reason we came.  My partner was craving a burger for weeks.  Perfect!!  When it arrived it was undesirable.  Ok, I understand that a burger with that particular name is going to be greasy, but this, NO WAY!!!  The grease was pooled in the bowl type piece of crisp, cool lettuce, that had been placed under the bottom burger.  And when it was attempted to be picked up and bitten in to, fingers penetrated the bottom bun, like sticking your finger in bread marinating for bread pudding.  Gag me with a spoon, that is THE ULTIMATE pet peeve, heebie jeebie - type situation.   Dis-gus-ting!!!!      We told the waitress right away and she promptly removed it with out any question.  And took it off the bill.  Good job, and thank you.  Was a bit confused as to why the manger had not come over and said anything.  Under any usual circumstance, if something needs to be voided, a manager is notified.  They normally make an appearance to the table, just to even check with the customer Unless, this staff is doing voids on their own...?!?!        Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised.  The place is run by kids.  Highs school and early college-age kids.  Not speaking badly of that.  I did the same thing when I was that age.  But on every shift, I feel there should be some more ""experienced"" staff to at least manage situations.  I do not feel it fair to a young staff member to have to apologize for a mistake that the kitchen made, which in the long run, falls on the manager.  Sorry to say.            I used to enjoy drink and apps at the bar from time to time.  Unfortunately,now that the reno has been done, I will be relocating elsewhere.  There is no separation between bar crowd rowdiness and the other dining areas.  The music is overpowering, as are the Tv's.  And it's only a Sunday, and there weren't even any sports on!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=60,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956
48,Shane L.,"Scarborough, ME",326,289,621.0,1.0,2014-01-07,"I am going to truly say that this had to be a trip to a restaurant with the family that was more of a scene from the Twilight Zone rather than an enjoyable experience. First I will start off by saying that it seemed that there was no management present on the floor while people were being sat throughout the restaurant. When we first came in, we waited about 10 minutes without even a hello (with no one waiting)  before having someone that looked like they were inconvenienced to sit us but finally sat us in the cramped area of a stool seat with a small bench for the three of us.   The dining room floor was cluttered with garbage all over the area where the waitstaff was punching in the orders.  The waitress that came over and took our order stated that the restaurant was almost out of napkins so she was not supposed to give us any napkins so she stole one off of a table that was uncleaned and gave me the napkin.  What??? The food that was delivered was both cold and gummy.  We were sorely disappointed with our experience here.  To top it all off three of the waitstaff were flirting with each other and touching each other at the place where they punched orders in. The bathroom was out of paper towels and my son said it was out of toilet paper.

Waiter was very personable but I think pretty overwhelmed with his amount of tables along with our group. The food is where they failed horribly!! The portion size was small compared to the price and it took forever to get food to the table. When it did come out it was overcooked and dry gruel! Overdone chicken and broccoli that tasted spoiled! We also ordered drinks that were great! The bartenders did well by me. In the end the service wasn't bad and the management tried very hard to make things right. That is why I gave 3 stars !

6,Jade B.,"Westborough, MA",116,66,45.0,1.0,2015-04-16,"They get ONE star for service. Our waitress was very attentive considering how busy it was. I went with three friends last night. None of us had been there in a long time, so we decided to give it a try. We were seated in a booth with the  sun glaring in our eyes. They have sun shades, mind you. They don't use them, apparently. We ordered drinks. The beer and wine list is fairly decent. I ordered the cheapest red. A 9oz pout was $9. And it's safe to say they didn't even fill it to 9oz. The glass was dirty on top of that. The menu was huge, but only one vegetarian dinner on the menu. A black bean burger. Described as spicy, but it was very bland. The bun was greasy, and the burger itself fell apart and had to be eaten with a knife and fork. The fries described as seasoned? Only drenched in salt and pepper. They were so salty I needed a tall glass of water.  I can't describe my friends' meals taste, but you think they'd accommodate. One friend wanted a particular burger, but without mushrooms. They wouldn't do it. Portions were small for the ridiculous prices. One veggie burger. 2 glasses of wine. $30?!!!

We ordered drinks and the kids meals first, along with boneless wings. The kids meals took a while. The drinks took forever. When the drinks finally came, the waitress apologized for the slow bar service. I could then see her apologizing to other tables as well. Time to cut bait. Since we still had not received our appetizer, we decided to forego any kind of main dish and just ask for our check and have the wings to go. You know when eating with 2 small kids, when their food is gone, it's time to go. They would not have waited patiently for daddy and mommy to finish their meals. No problems with the food quality. We had boneless wings with miso sauce. They were yummy on the ride home. Kids had Mac n cheese. It was Mac n cheese. My kids were crazy the whole time.

The second (which I feel needs justification) was due to the other options in the area having longer waits.

I had my best friend try one and she also said they were awful, but that they were worse than she remembered.

8,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565.0,5.0,2015-12-12,"I had the BEST experience at the Millbury TGI Fridays today.  Literally, my favorite restaurant now. Even better than the amazing Milford TGI Fridays (and that's saying something!) Visited today, while shopping in this amazing shopping center (called Shoppes @ Blackstone Valley), which by the way, is right off Route 146 (Worcester Providence Tpke), 5 minutes from Worcester and 15 from Northbridge and Grafton, and had an amazing experience with waitress Dawn and manager Jeremiah.  Before today, I had never been to this location and didn't know what to expect. My first impression today was great, as the interior is extremely clean, and everyone is amazing. The host was very friendly and got me to a wonderful booth, which was clean, comfortable, and HUGE (in comparison with other restaurants). Plus, this location is renovated (which means it's even CLEANER, more modern-looking, and the storefront says just ""Fridays"", without TGI). So first impressions rocked and the experience was even better.  I had a coupon I got in my email for a free entree with the purchase of an entree and 2 drinks, and it was valid at the Milford location. Since my phone was very near of losing battery, I wanted to ask the manager / waitress if they would ever be able to accept it. This is when manager Jeremiah came over and said he would be ever so happy to take the coupon, as well as being extremely friendly (and not seeming annoyed like they are in other restaurants). Following, he came back over and provided the BEST customer service I've received EVER. Since my iPhone was at 10% battery or less, he offered to plug it in in his office (as he has the same phone). So did I not only get great food and service, but my phone was able to be charged while I was at it! So impressed and thankful that he charged it for me. Following, Dawn came over (who was our amazing waitress), who was very friendly, efficient and helpful. She made everything go smoothly, fast, and incredible throughout my visit to the Millbury location. Also, I consistently order a classic cheeseburger whenever I go to TGI Fridays and this was the best burger I've ever had throughout my many visits to any TGI Fridays.       Amazing experience. There is no way I won't be returning to this location. I guess I'll have to make the special, nearly an hour trip back to the amazing Shoppes @ Blackstone Valley.  DEFINITELY make this your ""lunch"" spot for a shopping day in Millbury. 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.004,2.44

When we got our bill yesterday we were surprised to find out that drinks are now $12. They were great drinks, they were not $12 drinks. I've had plenty that were worth $12 or more, these aren't on that list. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken over mac and cheese. The m&c is now a small dish on the side. The chicken was about 3 oz (maybe 1/4 of a breast) and it was smothered in some mustard sauce that was completely disgusting with a sprinkling of saw dust like parmesan cheese on top. After it took 40 minutes to get these, I wasn't going to send it back. I ate the ""tomato and mozzarella salad (2 small balls of cheese cut in half with a ton of dry tomatoes) and the m&c and tossed the rest. We were there over an hour and all we had was a main course.

The selection of $3 drinks and $5 apps, can't go wrong. The only thing that's a huge pain every time going is dealing with the food specials. You see commercials like the unlimited app for $10 or the full rack of ribs for $10 and say, oh hey awesome, I want those. It's always a circus trying to work it out with staff because the tv advertised food specials are never listed in the menu and the wait staff is always clueless when asked. That means whenever there's a special, it goes something like this for me, and I suggest you do the same: I call ahead of time to ask about the special and they confirm it. I get there and ask for the special, and the wait staff is clueless. They call a manager over to ask about it, and they say the special isn't available. I say I saw the special on tv earlier that day, and I called before coming to make sure they offered it. More back and forth, they go talk to their manager, they give me the special price. They need to list their current food specials on the menu and avoid the three ring circus.

When we received the steak 20 minutes after ordering, which was ordered medium rare, the steak was cooked far past well-done. Throughout the dining experience I waited upwards of 20 minutes (3 times!) in between ordering the next round of appetizers and receiving them. At one point, it took 20 minutes for our server to even come back to the table to even ask if there was anything that we needed. I eventually asked to speak to a manager. A young woman dressed exactly like the servers came out to talk to me. From her demeanor, it seemed like she was just one of the servers whom the other servers had coerced into talking to me as they did not feel like addressing the issue themselves. I voiced my complaints with her, and all she could offer to do regarding my complaints was ""pass it on"" to the kitchen. I received no resolution from taking to the ""manager"". After we requested the check from our server, we were handed a lone receipt. We paid in cash and awaited our change. Our server then gave us change but had left out the loose change we were owed! It seemed as though she assumed that the change was to be part of the gratuity for the bill. It was the perfect cap to one of the worst dining experiences that I've had. We were very disappointed by the staff's conduct, as they seemed to enjoy talking to each other more than tending to the few patrons in the dining room and the lack of supervision.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
