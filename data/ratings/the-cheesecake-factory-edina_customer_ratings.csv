52,Monica B.,"St Paul, MN",4,47,1.0,2.0,2012-01-25,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, I absolutely love it.. BUT--I hate that it is a 50-50 chance that i will get bad service when I go. I have never gone twice in a row and had good service both times... NEVER. This visit the waitress just seemed to be sidetracked. I dont know if she was close to getting off or what, (or maybe she was just an airhead) but we had to repeat EVERYTHING we said, because she was never paying attention. I asked her if the Mac and Cheese was baked, she didnt know, so i told her that if it was, and if it came with Bacon (because it usually does when its baked) to leave the bacon off. 10-15 minutes later, a chef brings me out Mac and cheese.. and annouces they removed the ""breadcrumbs"" as i requested!! What? no, no i wanted my breadcrumbs!!!  At this point i was so hungry i was just like screw it, so i didnt even ask if they could fix it. I just hate going here not knowing what/who i will get.

28,Blessed A.,"St Paul, MN",0,25,,1.0,2012-03-06,"oh man. Am i ready to give Cheese Cake factory a review. *(cracking my knuckles)*  food was ok. Cakes were good. no complaints there. NOW... let me begin halfway through our dinner with my loved one. the waiter comes over with a smerk on his face. i could tell he didnt want to be there by the look on his face. or maybe moms just dropped him on his face one to many times while watching Oprah with a pack of Full Flavored Kool 100's in one hand while juggling him and the bottle of Scotch in the other? so....... he comes over stares at me with a David hasselhof look and says anything else. We said No thank you. he reaches into his pocket and pulls out some sort of stick, leans up and over into my food and starts to sweep off some of the pepper that i accidently got on the table. Shocked with disbelief in my mind i was like WTF yo?!? he takes a step back, this time gives me a ""The Apprentice"" your FIRED!!!

146,Jean L.,"Rockford, IL",3,6,,1.0,2012-03-27,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. I was traveling to MN and discovered this location. The food of course was amazing but the service was absolutely horrible. As I walked in there were a few girls standing at the hostess podium. It wasn't until after they were done chatting did they acknowledge my party. As we were waiting on our food, which took FOREVER even though they weren't even that busy, I witnessed 2 waiters picking at their nose without ever washing their hands or removing themselves from the floor to go to the restroom. Absolutely every employee that worked there looked miserable. Not one employee was happy or even pleasant to talk to. Our waitress never refilled our drinks and I had to sip on my boyfriend's until we left. She was so rude and seemed like she absolutely hated her job.

50,Mere W.,"Minneapolis, MN",37,172,12.0,2.0,2012-04-12,"Sigh.  Yes, the cheesecake factory has the largest menu in the Twin Cities.  It is probably a great spot to go if you have a group of people that all want different cuisine.  You can get breakfast, Mexican, Asian, burgers, and pasta all at the same place.  However, the food is only okay.  And the wait is worse!  They do not take reservations and the wait times are crazy.  Furthermore, I have never had good luck with the hostesses.  They always seem really annoyed to be working that particular day.   I will not deny that the cheesecake is huge.  They do have a take-out counter specifically for the cheesecake.  I say use that counter if you must and otherwise try to avoid the wait times here.  There are so many other unique and delicious spots in the Twin Cities - go to these spots!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=160,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.7280000000000006,3.2400000000000007
32,Mike C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",16,131,11.0,3.0,2012-04-12,"Visited the Southdale location yesterday and was mildly impressed. Upon entry I was pleasantly surprised by the decore. I don't know if I have actually ever been to a Cheesecake Factory and if I have it has probably been a while, so it is completely possible that subconsciously definition of The Cheesecake Factory has been slowly built through the many episodes of ""Big Bang Theory"" that I have watched. The floors are white marble, the booths and tables are constructed of some sort of dark wood, and the lighting is a bit brighter than dim which helps make this place seem more classy. I ordered the Chicken Marsala which was served on a bed of bow tie pasta and one stray tube of penne pasta. Chicken Marsala is typically one of my favorite Itallian dishes as it offers the perfect balance of sweet and salty with the nice Marsala wine flavor. The portion that came was fairly large and came with a good amount of chicken and mushrooms and a nice brown gravy. If presentation were the only catagory I was judging this place on they would have certainly earned at least one additional star. After the first few bites I noticed that the chicken did not really have any flavor itself, and the Marsala sauce resting on the chicken was the only thing giving the dish any life at all. This immediately made me think of a large metal tin resting gently on a tub of hot water, in the kitchen, piled high with chicken breasts and ""chefs"" pulling from this pile, throwing them onto a bed of (insert pasta type here) then going over to the sauce bin, slathering the plate with (insert sauce type here), right before being served. More or less your high end production assembly line type of food service (for clarification: high end for this catagory is at best 3 stars). The Marsala sauce had nice initial flavor, unfortunately the back end tasted a bit watered down. I don't like wasting food, so I finished the chicken and mushrooms, but the pasta and watery sauce was too much for me to be able to put it down. Being that we were at the Cheesecake Factory and that I love Cheesecake, this made for a very nice arrangement! If you are an avid Cheesecake lover such as myself they basically have every variety of cheesecake you would ever want. Fruit toppings, chocolate toppings, candy bar toppings, Orea toppings, combinations thereof, the list is endless and one should literally decide by throwing a dart into a board. We ended up with the Snickers Cheesecake and it was delicious! Had we just come here for dessert, easily 4 stars. It tasted like the whip cream was made in-house; it was nice and cold, thick, and paired very nicely with our cheesecake, and I can easily see it pairing well with fruit topped cheesecakes as well. Overall the experience was enjoyable, I just wish the food tasted better (especially for the price), and that the server came around a bit more frequently. Their long list of cheesecakes will probably bring me back sometime in the near future, but unfortunately probably not for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=200,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9240000000000004,3.2000000000000006

They are open till 12:30am on fri and sat.. regular days till 10pm I admit, I'm a fan of this chain. the service is always satisfactory and the price is very reasonable. Because this is the only cheesecake factory in the state of minnesota, it's always busy. Expect to wait 40 mins during dinner hrs BUT only 10 mins during the late weekend. Like I've mentioned on my tip, I'm a devoted  lover of their Fettuccini Alfredo w/ chicken. I've been ordering the same dish for the past 12 years. It's so rich in cream and the sun dried tomatoes definitely adds a zest to the taste. I also would recommend their miso salmon- the glazed salmon and rice goes perfect together. i tried to mimic their garlic noodles at home- mission failed. I'll stick to ordering from cheesecake instead. as far as cheesecake goes, i like their white chocolate truffle and the Oreo one is great too.... but if you like red velvet like i do, skip the cheesecake and go for the ultimate red velvet cake instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.056,3.2000000000000006

Now, on to the other food.  It was just okay, and we all ordered different items.  Nothing stood out exceptionally except for the prices which are extremely high.  A beer was over seven dollars?  Are you kidding me?  Our bill came to over one hundred dollars.  The best part of the meal was my pineapple upside down cheesecake, it was yummy!!!!!!!  Probably had three thousand calories though!  It's not a bad restaurant overall, we would probably go again, but it is overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=200,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7960000000000003,3.2800000000000002

I am usually skeptical of a restaurant that tries to do too much with its menu, but I have to say that they do a wonderful job with all of their menu items, I have onlyonce had a bad experience, the food was cold, and the waitress switched our meals when she boxed the food, we didnt find out until it was too late to swap.... i took a trip to bummer town that night bc i was really looking forward to leftovers for lunch the next day... oh well!

16,Tamera B.,"Plano, TX",196,214,174.0,2.0,2013-06-18,"We're from Chicago and visited Minneapolis for Father's Day weekend. My husband and I couldn't agree on a ""new"" restaurant to try, so we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory because in Chicago it's always a solid choice; food is always good and you know what you're getting. Sadly, this wasn't the case at this location. We ate here twice on this trip and we were disappointed both times.  The first meal was dinner. I ordered the Ne Orleans Shrimp, which is a dish I've had frequently at Cheesecake Factory's all around the country. On this particular occasion, it was cooked with the wrong sauce (it was yellow) and it had a curry-like taste to it. This ruined my entire meal and it was really late, so I didn't have the energy to complain and wait for a new meal to be prepared. The next meal we had here was brunch on Father's Day. We ate here mostly be use of convenience. Every other restaurant had a long wait and we were trying to make it to the Twins game. Anyway, my husband ordered egg whites, ham, and toast. My son's ordered ""crispy"" bacon with their meals. So, all of the food came out except my husband's. The waitress said that the cook forgot to only cook egg whites. So, about 7 minutes later, my husband gets his food with steaming hot eggs and cold meat and toast........yummy!!! Next, they only brought bacon for one of my sons and it was no where near crispy. We requested crispy bacon again and the waitress attempted to take my 4 year olds entire plate of pancakes back to the kitchen, just to get crispy bacon. The distraught look on his face was all she needed to sit the plate back down and she said she would just bring a side of bacon. So, she shows up about 1 minute later with some COLD crispy bacon. I imagine this was pre cooked bacon used to top salads and/or soups, because it obviously wasn't cooked that fast. We were tired of going back and forth an my son starting eating it so we just left it alone. My other son's bacon was never brought out, but we just told our waitress to take it off the check. So........on future trips to Minneapolis, we now know that Cheesecake Factory IS NOT an option and we would NOT recommend this place to anyone.

They definitely need more of these around the Twin Cities.  The food service and decor is a draw, but the lack of parking, long waits and crowds are a real turn off.  Try to plan you meal earlier or later than the normal times and it will be a better experience.  I would stay away on Friday and Saturday nights, it is just too crowded, expect a long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.056,3.3200000000000003

127,Andy M.,"Edina, MN",5,27,31.0,3.0,2013-11-30,"Emphasis was on ""Factory"" that night (11/26), especially with a party of 8.  It started off odd. We had been told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. We were standing around (all seats/benches occupied with other wanna-be diners) for about 5 minutes when the pager went off. Excited that the wait was shorter, I showed others in our party and turned around to the host stand. Some host/manager guy said, hey, it's going to be about 15-20 minutes. I didn't know how to process the information, so I just said, ""um, yeah, you already told us that."" I thought about it and the people behind me that thought we were going to sit down and said, ""really, you paged me over here to tell me that? I thought our table was ready."" If it was a huge change in wait, I could see that, but it was more just odd. The food was mostly well-prepared, but the service was uneven. Any time you have people at the table going, ""oh, you guys go ahead and eat,"" you know there's trouble because enough time has elapsed that everyone's wondering where everyone else's meals are. There was about 5-10 minutes between the first plate and the last plate getting laid down. And no, no one ordered anything unusual or wanted special modifications. It was a weird night service-wise. The server was very personable and attentive at the table, but it took a while for drinks and bread, then we'd have these gaps of time where we wouldn't see him for a while. Their drink menu has a section of martinis - but none of the drinks on it are martinis, they're just these weird made-up sugary concoctions of bizarre flavor combinations. There was - honest to God - not a single martini on the page. I had to manually order a martini, specify an actual gin, and ask for olives. Sheesh! And it basically sucked. I hate that word, but it fits in this case. Made me feel like a idiot even ordering it. Oh well. Oh well, and about the menus, this is rich. These guys are so hard up for money, that they actually put ads for other stuff inside their menu. Not some food tie-in, just other stores at the mall (Southdale). So while I'm looking over the ridiculous non-martini Martini section, on the opposite page, I have some model leering at me with tacky-looking jewelry from some store in the mall. Ha! Another pet peeve - I ordered one of their burgers with fries. The fries came in a little metal bucket with a paper liner. The fries were just luke warm. Everyone that wanted to try one did what I did - ate 1-2, then no more. They're just gross when they're not hot. Oh, and if you're serving a burger with fries, you bring ketchup. Don't make me ask for it. That's another few minutes of waiting right there. They didn't even bring a bottle, just a little dressing bowl with a dollop of ketchup in it. Boo! Okay, soapbox mode off, but it was a strange dining experience. Oh, and yes, they do serve cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=120,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.9240000000000004,3.1600000000000006

I got the chicken madeira and a lemon drop martini, and my bf got the smokehouse bbq burger with a long island iced tea. I'm really glad that we decided against an appetizer, because zomg big effing portions. I was so stuffed and couldn't finish my chicken, which btw was delicious! I had asked the waiter to recommend some stuff to us, since their menu goes on forever (it truly is out of control), and that was one of the things he recommended, so I took a shot. It comes with mashed potatoes, a whole mountain of them, and two flattened chicken breasts breaded with....something, covered in cheese and asparagus, and then there's this sauce....idk it's like some kind of gravy that involves crack. All I know is that it was really really good. This could also be the lemon drop talking...I'm not sure. It's entirely possible that they booze you up before the food comes so you think it's amazing. We got cheesecake to go. That tuxedo business...it's got a lot of chocolate in it, so it's probably going to be good.  I can DEFINITELY see how annoying this place could be on a busy night, though. For as much as we enjoyed the atmosphere and the lack of other patrons (although their decor features a repetitive ""eye of sauron"" theme), by the time we left the annoying mall people and their tiny, loud children were arriving. Don't get me wrong, I love kids, I just don't like dining with them. So, I guess what I'm saying is go. Go during lunch time...maybe around 1 or 2 pm, and bring a lot of people so you can all get different dishes and then eat off each other's plates. Then get cheesecake to go.

By the time I left, I had experienced a number of emotions: shock, sadness, horror, anxiety, embarrassment, contempt, and apathy to name a few. My first observation on walking in is how vast the space is, with it's large booths, presumably to better service it's large patrons.  As I took my seat I was given a menu the size of a novella. The sheer amount of choices was immediately overwhelming. For the first time of many that evening, I was forced to face some of the worst traits of American culture. How could a kitchen possibly handle such a hyperbolized variety? Only if your goal is to flame the culinary vanity of a mundane crowd. It seemed like mere minutes after I ordered when the food arrived. Apparently in America, you're not supposed to order slow, and have a relaxed multi-hour dinner with camaraderie. The dining experience here has been reduced to an inhuman mechanical action: get in, eat, get out. In addition, the portions are offensively large, often achieving a caloric density not previously thought possible, perhaps even hitting the upper limits of physics.  I felt as if I was being grasped at the back of the head, forced to gaze upon America's disgusting gluttony, to revel in all the waste, to force me to contend with the obesity around me. The worst part? The Cheesecake Factory has no shame; it offers no apology. It accepts this cultural degeneracy, and happily promotes it. There is no noble goal to skirmish with the ignorance of it's customers, but further raises the curtain. There is certainly no complaint from the eaters, as they stuff their bloated faces.  Of the things I tasted, they ranged from okay to bad--expected given the size of the menu. The best thing I tried was this delightful little salad that came with my tacos. A tiny paradise amongst the sea of butter, cream, and grease. The disturbing experience left me enervated, leaving me to ponder my existential place in this country, and the future of our people. Let this review be a warning to all: if you have any decency or respect for yourself, go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=100,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.7280000000000006,3.3600000000000003

237,Rachel B.,"Minneapolis, MN",59,126,89.0,2.0,2014-06-04,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains I really enjoy. That said, the Southdale Cheesecake Factory is lacking. One problem is simply that this is the only Cheesecake Factory in the state, so the place is always crazy crowded.  You absolutely have to eat here at an off time or you'll be waiting for an hour. The other problem is the service. For the most part, the hostesses and the servers treat their jobs like they work in, well, a factory. They see the customers as products to churn out on the production line as fast as possible before their shifts end. No friendliness or warmth, and they spend as little time at your table as possible, which means that orders get messed up.  Also, one server gave us an extremely nasty look when we ordered a lunch portion to share, even though everyone knows perfectly well that their lunch portions are enough to serve at least two people.   As for the insanely sized portions of rich food that everyone complains about, well, I'm not so put off by that. Yes, I realize that this place is almost a satire of American gluttony, but use common sense, people!  There's no Clean Plates Club at the Cheesecake Factory. Share a dish family style or bring home the leftovers. I did eat an entire slice of cheesecake once, but I was seven months pregnant, and unless ths is the case or unless you are having a VERY bad day, do not engage in such foolishness. Share. Also, order the avocado egg rolls before Michael Bloomberg tries to make these illegal.  These may be more decadent and joy-inducing than the cheesecake, and that's saying quite a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=80,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.7920000000000007,3.2400000000000007

19,Matthew K.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,17,,1.0,2014-07-09,"The first time I came here, I was blown away. The menu is huge, there are endless choices, and they really live up to the cheesecake part of the name with a wide selection of expensive slices. Unfortunately, they also live up the ""factory"" part of the name, which is really not a good thing. Their portions are generally large, which is sometimes a good thing, and other times you wonder how you are going to get rid of a plate full of subpar, bland food. If you plan on drinking, make sure to ask for prices. They don't have a price list, but they will ""guess"" how much each drink is. Mixed drinks run around $10 and up (and aren't very impressive), and beer runs around $5. Happy hour is only at the bar.  I also feel it's my civic duty to warn any non-meat eaters: STAY AWAY! I have had meat in my meatless dishes not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. Each time, staff was apathetic. The first time, there was chicken (small shreds, everywhere, so at first it wasn't completely apparent) in a non-chicken fettuccine. The manager came over and said, ""oh, well, someone in the kitchen must have used the same tongs for chicken as they did for the pasta."" Basically, he shrugged it off, didn't offer to replace our dinner OR compensate us, and said, NO BIG DEAL. JUST CROSS-CONTAMINATION IN OUR KITCHEN.  Actually, it is a big deal, and it literally made me sick. I had to email the company and they gave me a gift card, which I used to buy their portabella and zucchini fries. Nearing the bottom of the batch, I poured them out and found, guess what? FRIED CHICKEN SKIN. I gave one to a meat-eating friend to verify, and she said it was definitely chicken. I had to stop there and laugh, but I also quickly got the check and got the hell out. I really want to love this place. It has so much potential, but between the apathetic staff, the long waits, and the subpar food, there isn't a whole lot to love. Not to mention the whole cross-contamination problem, which for some reason doesn't seem to phase the managers or servers. To be honest, the only saving grace of this place is their bread baskets.

Mom and I went on a Saturday evening, but thanks to our early 5:30 arrival we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Our server was a young guy who was very excited about everything. We were both a little irked that neither the drinks nor the cheesecake listed pricing on the menu. Mom was more than a little shocked to find out at the end of the meal that her chinsy watered down sangria was $9.50, especially compared to my $5 Sierra Nevada. When I asked him what the price was, he admitted he didn't know. I wanted my Farfalle pasta with sundried tomatoes, roasted garlic, peas, and pancetta. It is so delicious that I do NOT want to know how many calories I just ingested.  Mom asked the server for a recommendation and he had raving reviews for the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish. When they arrived, hers was a huge mountain of rice surrounded by the meat/shrimp. While the flavor was good (mostly just the coconut), she did note that there was no essence of ""bang-bang"" to be found. He got very defensive and snapped he never said it was spicy, and that white people don't understand what spice is. Odd... Our food was good, we were full with little leftovers, but somehow two drinks and two meals added up to over $50. He dropped the bill off with three other tables' tabs also in there which was odd.

Portobello mushroom avocado and zucchini fries $6.95 - I liked the texture of it except the fried avocado was not my favorite.

I only ate half of it and saved the rest for lunch tomorrow. The sauce it as glazed in was sweet. This meal came with a few vegetable peas but I wish it came with broccoli or more. It comes with white or brown rice. I'd recommend this dish at least once to try.   Dessert:  Lemon raspberry cream cheesecake - hands down light, fluffy, smooth, and all worth it!

The sausage looked more ground up than what I'm used to (more like chorizo form). There were large chunks of ricotta, which was nice. Ahi Tuna Tartare: Also solid. I feel like Ahi Tuna and Pork Belly are falling into the same category. Sad day. But, I digress. It's a solid eat. Kale and Apple Salad: Again, solid. Light and airy.

Ever notice that the cheesecake factory menu is mainly just chicken and cheesecake for the most part? I wasn't in the mood for chicken. So I went with fries. You know why I went with the fries?

My chicken and cashew was not good enough for crows to eat. A gross unflavored breaded and deep fried chicken (the same chicken in one of my kids Orange chicken) with a sauce you couldn't make that bad if you tried to make someone sick, no spice and flavor of dirty leather. One had the catfish and liked it, one pasta (which is always fair) the other Sheppard pie ( better than mine but thyme and burger I can make at home in 4 minutes) .

My favorite being the Chicken Bellagio on their Specialties menu. Angel hair, basil pesto sauce, crispy fried chicken breasts and my favorite part, the prosciutto and arugula on top. Wow.  Their Chipotle Chicken Pasta is also good, and their Avocado Egg Rolls are delicious for an appetizer.  Having a husband who does not eat avocados, they are all mine! Yay. Their hamburgers are good, probably similar to what you would find at Applebee's, not Red Cow. The Mac and Cheese burger is a yummy choice if you are looking for something different. Their French Fries are thick and fresh! Probably some of my favorite restaurant fries ever. The bread they serve with the meal is a French baguette and a Wheat Oatmeal loaf. Very good. For dessert I would recommend their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, Godiva Chocolate, Lemoncello cheesecake and this seasonal one I tried yesterday, the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. Everything about that last sentence screams incredible and you should try them all if you are a cheesecake lover! What this place does best is utterly behemoth portions that last 2-3 days in the fridge and you can get lots of leftover meals from it. Cheesecake included. It looks like Vegas inside, with lots of ceiling decorations and painted walls. Reminds me of the Luxor and Caesar's Palace, very pretty.

231,Ryan S.,"Lakeville, MN",0,39,,2.0,2015-06-25,"We normally love The Cheesecake Factory. The food and the service are usually great. This last time we were very disappointed in the temperature of the plates and the food. After the food runners brought our two kids meals and set them down in front of the children, they told us the plates were pretty warm and to be careful. I immediately moved the plate from in front of my 2 year old toddler and was astounded by how searing hot the plate was. I couldn't even manage to slide it over in front of me without using a folded napkin. My wife and I were both shocked that they would even consider serving children food on a plate that hot. It's weird because none of the food on the plate was very hot. It could have all been eaten immediately if it weren't for the ridiculously hot temperature of the plate.  Shortly after that our food came out, and again the plate was molten red hot magma temperature, but the food was barely above warm.  Seems like a silly thing to get worked up about, but the part that really made us mad was the manager Jennifer Madison's reaction to our concern about the plate temperatures for the kids meals.  She basically insinuated that we were terrible parents for not cutting our children's food and letting it cool before giving them the plates. (Even though HER runners are the ones that placed the plates in front of the children.) She stated that it was either company policy or a health code issue that required them to place all plates for service in the food window before being brought out to customers regardless of food type or age.  (Horse crap. I've eaten at PLENTY of restaurants where I've been served food on room temperature plates... and the food was actually hot to boot.) She gave off an air of indifference.

The female manger was completely rude and unprofessional and our food arrived far beyond late. I live in California and came to Minnesota to spend the holidays with my family. Needless to say, our time was rather precious, so imagine our huge disappointment with the atrocious service we received. Sit tight because there is quite a story to tell! First off, our server was a really nice guy, but he did put in the order for our appetizers late. We get it, it's New Year's Day, it's going to be crowded, but after waiting for an hour to get our table, we were not expecting this.  Even with the late order, the appetizers arrived exactly 50 minutes after ordering. Our appetizers not only took this long, but came one by one! Our first appetizer (the avocado egg rolls) was brought by a man who, after hearing about how long we waited, rudely responded by saying ""do you want it or not"". Our appetizers soon followed after 2 hours dedicated all to this restaurant. Oh yeah, the food! The two tables sitting next to us all received their food even after coming at least twenty minutes after us. One of our family members had to leave because he had to work!!! Our food came and it was fine, but at this point, we lost our appetite honestly. The manger, Jennifer, was INCREDIBLY RUDE. She took two appetizers off out of an order from a group of seven people and made far too many rude comments. She said that she would take care of the food of my family member, but we didn't realize she would take it off completely! When we asked to order it, she said that she would have to charge us. Really?!? He left because we had waited far more than an hour, and know we have to pay?! At this point, we were livid and wished to speak to the general manager. As Jennifer left, she said that she had been here for 12 years and was experienced for the job. She has been here for 12 years; that doesn't mean they were good years! Absolutely horrible. Anyway, in short, the general manager came, but none of the ""reductions"" could fix this horrible experience. I will certainly be contacting the main facility as this was beyond absurd. The food was fine, but the process to get it was beyond crazy. The manager was absolutely rude and the length for food arrival was absurd.

108,Ellen C.,"Oakland, CA",148,710,23.0,4.0,2016-01-02,"One of the greats when it comes to chains. All Cheesecake Factories deliver consistently on service and food. There always seems to be a wait for this place, but unlike in SF, the wait is generally around 30 minutes to an hour. Ambience is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory, strangely pleasing despite being a chain, they've really got the design and experience down pat!  We got the grilled salmon (comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli) and the chicken bellagio (lightly crisped chicken breast on top of pesto spaghetti, prosciutto, and arugula). I've never been let down with any of the dishes I've had here, their pastas are always delicious (if you're not expecting hand made pasta), their avocado egg rolls are amazing. I've never had anything sweet or savory that I regretted here, so it's a safe choice and a great place if you just want a good, reliable meal without figuring out where to go.  This is located in the Southdale Mall, so if you don't want to wait you can try the other restaurants they have in the same mall (PF Chang's, Rojo's, an Italian fast food place) or you can go catch a movie @ AMC. There's always shopping! But remember that their buzzer doesn't work anywhere outside Cheesecake.  The only thing they could do a little better is to have a bigger bar area to have a place for people to hang out before they get their tables - it gets way too crowded in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=20,3.2,3.26,3.26,2.7359999999999998,3.2360000000000007

But me and my boyfriend came in a Saturday knowing there would be a wait, so we came at 5pm. We were told that the wait was going to be 1 hour and 10 minutes, which we were fine with waiting. After waiting 1 hour and 35 minutes I decided to check to see where we were on the list (which I never like to be the person that always does that) and the girl looked at our pager number and looked on the computer and told us we were next up. So we stood closer to the host desk, so we were ready to go. After a table of 5, then a table of 2, then a table of 3, then another table of 2 got seated, I was getting confused and annoyed. I asked a different person why we haven't been seated and that we've been waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes at this point when we were told it would only be 1 hour and 10 minutes and he quickly sat us and told the other hostess that the pager wasn't ever working. While we were waiting, we saw the hostess sometime go out and call for peoples name and we have never heard our named called, even when we were told that we were next up. So I wasn't furious for waiting that long, I was furious that they gave us a pager that didn't work and didn't attempt to call our name. After we got seated, I assumed that someone told them to put our orders on rush since we waited so long, because there was a couple that got seated 5 minutes after us and we had already gotten all of our good before they received their appetizers. We felt rushed to eat our 2 appetizers to have room for our entrees.

Let's start from the top and work our way to the desert. Waited maybe 20 minutes, which was a relatively short time compared to other places (which were way better to eat at) that I have been to. Sat down and started looking over the long menu of 200 something items. I'll stop you at this point, that's a list of 200 disappointments to choose from. While everyone in our group had something different, not a single person was impressed with their meal. Ordered a couple of things to try off the snacks/sides/appetizer sections of the menu. Was not impressed really with ANY of it. Placed our main order in and half of the table's order came out. Waited several minutes before our waiter realized that only half the table got their order. Waited a few more minutes to get our plates. I had the bacon-bacon cheeseburger. There's nothing I love more than a good classic. This was the complete opposite. Bacon was BURNT to a black strip of what had appeared to be bacon. I almost cried for the bacon abuse! Started conversing with everyone else and their thoughts about their meal. Not a single dish was really worth the cost nor taking more than a couple of bites worth and feeling sick. Fries were salty as BLEEP! Had a glob of what appeared to be the 2 different cheeses on top of my burger. The special sauce really isn't a sauce, but more like some random ingredients pureed to a disgusting blob on the bottom of my burger. Everyone pushed their plates aside and waited, for what seemed like an eternity for our waiter to return. Ordered some deserts and was hoping at this time in the night that our horrid experience would make a turn for the better. Was let down yet again, and wasn't surprised. A hot fudge brownie sundae was ordered, was nothing more than some mere few pieces of brownie (that tasted old) and ice cream with-get this-Hershey's chocolate syrup that was cold served up. Whip cream? More like whipped milk! Even their so called famous cheesecakes were a joke! Over sugary, old, hard as a rock icing, thrown together mess of a desert better describes it!

193,Jody M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,13,,2.0,2016-06-15,"I've been hesitant writing a review of this Cheesecake Factory as the overall experience has been so inconsistent. However, my last experience, made me see life through Gordon Ramsey's eyes.  The first thing I will say is that the avocado egg rolls were amazing. So excellent job. Most appetizers I've had here have been great.  Yet, unfortunately the main course was anything but. I'll keep it short in saying we ordered our daughter buttered noodles, a nice simple meal as long as it doesn't sit under a heat lamp for too long. By our estimates, the buttered noodles were under a heat lamp for at least 20 minutes. The end result is severally brown, and hard noodles, you can't put a fork in. I am not joking when I say this. Even the person helping our server looked at the dish when they were putting it on the table, paused before putting it down, looked curiously at the dish and then layed it in front of our 2-year-old. A piping hot plate, and dried food.  I thought maybe it would have ended there, but by order of enchiladas were dried too, the sauce was entirely baked into the tortilla meaning: no sauce. The beans had a cooked layer of dryness, and the cilantro rice was so baked on the top layer, I could practically remove the entire layer as it's own cover. I tried one, bite, but it was hard and I couldn't finish it.  My son said his spicy chicken sandwich was okay, except that the spice was inconsistent. One part of the chicken had almost no spice and the other was way too hot for him to eat. While this is an opinion of his, I would agree with him that there shouldn't be so much disparity on a single piece of chicken.  Our server was friendly when she took our orders, but never brought the bread she said she was going to bring, and only showed up once after we received our order. That was to give us a check. When she asked if I wanted a box for the pasta we didn't eat, she looked down at the bowl, and said, ""Oh. Probably not."" I thought about saying something to management, but frankly I've had similar experiences, and was just tired of saying anything.  The cheesecake was of course very good.  End result of my many experiences here: Appetizers are always amazing, service can be great, or shoddy depending on the server, main entrees are wildly inconsistent. Cheesecake is always very good.  Overall, the inconsistency is very difficult as I don't know if I am going to have a nice meal, or a bad experience. I've yet to have an overall good experience, but I'm hoping it does happen. I keep rooting for them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=40,2.88,3.1,3.1,2.6640000000000006,3.0120000000000005

117,Heidi H.,"Minneapolis, MN",53,4,,2.0,2016-06-27,"Last Tuesday I went to dine here at 8:30 pm. The waiter seemed very nice and we got our drinks after a few minutes. I ordered the raspberry lemonade and it was so incredibly sour I could not drink it. I asked for the hibiscus instead. It took 30 minutes for that to come out.  When our food came, it was not what I ordered. The waiter who brought out the food told me he would have the manager come talk to us, that never happened. The waiter came back after 10 minutes and I told him the order was wrong and he said ""Oh yeah those 2 are right next to each other in the computer, I'll get it changed"". This would've been fine if they just re-fired the food right away. I know, working in the industry in the past, that you need to let the kitchen and manager know when you mess up an order so they can get it pushed to the front and it won't take long to make. I ordered the chicken picatta and it took ANOTHER 40 MINUTES for me to receive my food. By this time my date was done with his food (I told him not to wait).  We only saw the waiter during these couple times and he never came back to check on us and we never  saw the manager. Finally, the bill came and we were charged for BOTH drinks I had ordered even though I did not even drink the first one! He said he couldn't take it off the bill since it came to the table.. WHAT?!  For all the time we wasted (it wasn't even busy) this was not worth it. We weren't offered a discount or even free cheesecake or anything for all we went through.

My boyfriend suprised me and took me here for the first time after he popped the question last weekend. I ALWAYS wanted to come here but never had the chance. First we waited 40 mins to get seated WITH a reservation. Second of all they brought me the wrong food! I ordered farfalle chicken & garlic which had tomatoes in it and I told the server I am allergic to tomatoes when ordering and on top of that they did not include the mushrooms in the dish which I love mushrooms. I had to send my dish back due to the tomatoes and was told it would be 30 mins to get it remade. Instead of waiting my fiance shared his chicken Madeira which was good but Luke warm when they brought it to our table. The best part of the meal was the calamari, the banana cream and white chocolate rasberry cheesecake. The service wasn't that great either we had to wave down our server for drink refills and waited 30 mins after we were done eating for the check. Sadly this is not what I would of expected for a nice restaurant.

187,Kurt M.,"Minneapolis, MN",277,230,3.0,4.0,2016-08-18,"The impulse to look upon chain restaurants with disdain is understandable. Too often they tend to live down to already modest expectations. That said, on the multiple occasions I've enjoyed lunch or dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, I find them a cut above average. Ordinarily a menu as voluminous as the one offered by CF would be a bright red flag. No place can be all things to all people. Right? While this may hold true in general, and while CF may have an occasional miss, I've found the majority of items that I've tried to be hits. I particularly like the Chicken Piccata (I substitute mashed potatoes for the angel hair pasta). It probably has more sodium than a family of five needs in a week. But it's rich, savory and chock full of mushrooms and capers. It invariably makes for two meals since I end up taking about half of the serving home with me. The other day I ate here with my daughter before a visit to the Apple Store (my next review). She ordered the Vegan Cobb Salad described as ""Crisp Lettuce Topped with Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa, Almonds and Sunflower Seeds with House Vinaigrette."" It was bright, crisp and filled with fresh veggie goodness. She can be quite critical of commercial salads but pronounced this a winner. She added to it an order of falafel. We both found them to be appealingly crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside. I've never experienced anything other than cordial and professional service. Iced Tea and water are promptly refilled without asking. Food arrives in a reasonable time frame and is typically at the proper temp. There have been some longer wait times for a table but nothing too onerous. Most recently (on a Tuesday evening) we were seated immediately. This is not a hipster, foodie destination. Nor does it aspire to be such. It really is one of those relatively rare destinations where in my experience everyone should be able to find something much to his or her liking. Finally, of course the cheesecake is very good. I especially like the Dulce de Leche Caramel and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. I also enjoy a very occasional slice of the Chocolate Tower Truffle cake. Extremely indulgent? Yep! Excessively caloric? You betcha! Completely over the top? No doubt. But I rationalize the dessert overload by noshing on it for a few days, pulling a huge slice out of the frig for a few bites at a time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina,2.8,3.04,3.04,3.216,2.9440000000000004

I met a friend today at the Factory for brunch and arrived right as they were opening, so there was no wait and I was promptly seated.  It had been almost a year since I was last at the Factory, so when I went there today, I was surprised that the amount of calories was listed next to almost each item.  The calorie count of certain dishes and slices of cheesecake that I had eaten before shocked me a bit!  One certainly does not go here if one is on a diet!  ;)  At any rate, the server was polite, courteous, and attentive.  I ordered avocado toast, which was OK, and some coffee.  I felt the avocado could have been slightly more well seasoned with a little extra lime and salt, but that's just me.  I did enjoy the multiple fresh sprigs of cilantro but not sure why there were radishes included.  My friend ordered an omelette with ham.  She assumed the ham would be cut up and incorporated into the omelette, but instead, she was brought a whole slice of ham on a plate.  She told the server about it, returned her plate, and the problem was promptly rectified, and she seemed to enjoy her food.  The serving, of course, was huge, so she wasn't able to finish it all.   As an aside, one of the fun things I like about coming to the Cheesecake Factory is, if it's your birthday, they will give you a special plate with ""Happy Birthday To You"" written on the plate in chocolate sauce as well as receiving a free miniature sundae with a candle.

He was extremely nice and prompt when we needed something. He had the perfect server personality, charming but not so charming that you can tell it's fake. He seemed genuinely concerned with making sure we were taken care of and enjoying our meals. The drinks from the bar were excellent and beautifully presented (they used all fresh mint, fruit, etc.). Food was great, including the pumpernickel bread or whatever it was that came free. We got the Cobb salad as an appetizer. The vinaigrette dressing was light but still flavorful and the avocado was soft and ripe. Will definitely order it next time. The cheesecake we took home was also bomb! One thing I appreciated was that we were there for almost 2.5 hours and James never made us feel like he was in a hurry for us to get out of there. I've worked in the service industry for a long time and understand the pain when tables ""camp out"" in your section. I even apologized to him but he assured us that we can stay as long as we want. Granted we did continue to order drinks and dessert so it's not like we were sitting there sipping waters for an hour or anything. I briefly chatted with someone who i assume was a manger of some sort, and he was very personable and outgoing. Overall I was super impressed with our experience! I was shocked to see The Cheesecake Factory only had 3 stars on Yelp, so I wanted to be sure to leave a review. The only thing that i was less than impressed with were the bathrooms. It was a bit unkept and most stalls were out of toilet paper (something that's understandable at 7:30pm mid dinner rush, but like I said it was like 4-5ish). I will definitely be back and will probably request James F!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=60,3.52,3.09,3.09,3.124,3.262

After perusing the menu he settled on a personal pizza with a good size Caesar salad. He commented that it was quite a hearty portion. I had the lunch size chicken and avocado salad. We washed our lunches down with a few beers and a bloody mary which was subpar. Nothing too special about that bloody mary. Service was great as always. Lunch time conversation, gabbing with my friend in the back booth was a perfect combination of food, great service and fun and we didn't have to wait to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina,3.6,3.05,3.05,,3.27

The interior decor must be what people are hooked on about because the food left me less than impressed. Everything we had was subpar. The chicken wings were burnt...I couldn't believe they actually brought the wings out like that. My friend asked for light sauce in her alfredo and it still came out drenched. My omelette was good, but you really can't mess up an omelette. My side potatoes were burnt. I didn't even take any leftovers home because I don't want to eat it again! The waitress was nice and understanding, that's why this is a two star review. My friend was able to have the wings taken off her bill. Unfortunately would not come back here :(. Also the menu selection is huge which probably contributes to subpar food. They include everything from American, Italian, to Vietnamese and Chinese.

170,Nikki M.,"Minneapolis, MN",645,53,131.0,4.0,2017-07-26,"Leaving the famous Cheesecake Factory a 4, ONLY because I go often and usually have a great experience there. Though in my last visit, I would've ranked it a solid 2.5, and that kills me 'cause I love CF. Went last night for the boo thang's early birthday dinner. The breakdown of last night's shenanigans: Drinks: - Asian Pear Martini: Yuuum! This more so felt like a dessert than anything. It was sweet, smooth, & delicious. Only complaint is that it felt like there was barely any alcohol in it (granted it's supposed to be a sweet drink). If you're looking for something boozy like me, this might not be the drink for you. Apps: - THEIR BROWN STARTER BREAD: That sweet, delectable, soft, brown goodness that they serve before every meal. Just... wow. I think I more so come just for that than anything else really. If I could start my days with that bread, I couldn't pasta-bly (ha) ask for more. - Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls: probably should've expected this 'cause... I mean... it's a pasta restaurant... but the their take on Vietnamese spring rolls were a huge no-go for us. We were pretty sure they pre-made it and left them in the coolers all day. Wasn't fresh AT ALL. Entrees: - Farfalle w/ Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Pasta: Now THIS was bomb. You'd have to order it to see what I'm talking about. Normally comes with chicken, but I switched and paid the upgrade for shrimp. Only complaint is again- last night being the weird variable- I was pretty sure they forgot about us 'cause the food took way too long to come out, and it also came out barely warm. Normally a great meal though and still highly recommend. - Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp: the boo somewhat liked it. Huge portions which was a plus and had a colorful variety on the plate. First time ordering it so perhaps if it came out hotter, we might've enjoyed it more. Overall- though last night's experience was off, in general, they're a great place to eat. Didn't get a chance to eat their cheesecake last night, but note that it's one of the best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina,3.6,3.16,3.16,,3.3360000000000007

I've been to a couple of locations and this one is just like the rest. Food is average but you get huge portions. They also have tons of staff... yet always seen to offer very poor service.

We had avocado egg rolls and crispy Cuban rolls for our apps, both of which were hot, fresh and tasty. We had a slight wait on the bread because it came right out of the oven, which is OK by me! My savory Chicken Madeira hit the spot, although I also had a bite of the Chicken Costoletta, and I would definitely order that next time because it was light on the breading and the lemon was fresh in a tangy but not overpowering way. I was told the chopped salad was also excellent. We had cheesecake, of course! I branched out from my favorite (White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle) and I was not disappointed with my Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. My friends highly enjoyed their very chocolaty cheesecakes, too, of which there is quite a variety.  The server was fun and friendly, but also gave us our space. We enjoyed the outdoor patio setting, which was much quieter and pleasantly warmer than the air conditioned interior, though this was my first time on the patio and I've had equally pleasant experiences on my previous visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=20,3.48,3.18,3.18,,3.3000000000000007

In any case, I got the Cherry Cheesecake (traditional with cherry topping) and hubby got a chocolate mousse (?). Both were fantastic!

I ordered an vegetarian pasta recommended by our waitress, it was super chewy and not edible. They were gracious enough to take it off the bill.

However I do not get the same feeling about the Cheesecake Factory here in Minnesota. Here's my experience: Last night me and some coworkers visited this establishment in edina for a Christmas celebration. Being a Saturday, we knew there would be a wait on getting a table. However, at check in the hostess said it would be an hour wait. So we went over to partake in a drink at the bar while waiting. We saw that the high top tables were available and was told we could eat there and they were open seating. So we took two high top tables and the waitress brought us our menus, water, and bread. 15 mins later she came back and took our orders, I order the Fish and Chips and there was 10 of us. So it took about 30 mins for ""our"" food to arrive so multiple people brought our food but not our server. Any who after the last waitress showed up with a plate I still was missing my food. Waiting 5 more minutes my food still didn't arrive and nor did our waitress come to make sure everything was ok. So midway through my party eating my waitress final shows up, which was about 20 mins after the food was served. It was clear that I had an empty place in front of me and I had not received my food but she went to the other side of the table with the people who were eating to ask if they were ok. So I motioned her to ask her where was and asked her where was my food. Her answer, ""oh you didn't receive your food, I don't know what happened well what did you order I'll have them remake it for you."" So I said, ""remake, what do you mean it was never made, and what do you mean my coworkers were almost done eating."" I proceeded to say just cancel my order because at this rate I cant enjoy my food because my party was done. So as she brought the checks she came to me first and tried to tell me the reason I didn't get my food was because I sent it back. So I said why would I do that, that makes no sense, then she told me the wrong item I ordered. I was so distraught, I couldn't eat with my coworkers, I was really hurt and to have my coworkers sharing their meal with me because I was hungry. This is totally un acceptable after being there in total for about an hour and a half I had to go to wendys to get a chicken sandwich because I was hungry.
