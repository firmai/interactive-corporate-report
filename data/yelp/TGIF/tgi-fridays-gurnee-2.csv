Claudy C.,"Chicago, IL",11,184,119,4.0,10/28/2017,So... my experience at this location was a delight. Our waiter was so friendly and courteous. He always checked up on us if we needed anything.  Food... was better than expected. I think TGI Fridays is better than chilies. My Mac and cheese is good and the Jack Daniels burger was very good. My friends got mostly chicken entrees and they were satisfied with their meal.  Great atmosphere and clean place. The service was amazing and our food was good. I will give 4 stars for now. Really good food and will come back after a day at six flags.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2
Tiffany B.,"Palatine, IL",216,309,930,5.0,10/16/2017,"I must say i was impressed by this location. My husband and I arrived and there was a wait, shortly after we sat and waiter took our orders, super friendly staff and organized. Took our orders and was in top of out table to ensure we were OK. Prices are not bad for what we had. I have a great time/experience which is hard to say for chain restaurants. Did  it visit lavatory so I cannot comment. Place was clean and good flow when they are busy which is important. I reccomend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2
Billy D.,"Grayslake, IL",0,11,,1.0,9/7/2017,"I don't normally comment on large chains as they are pretty cookie cutter establishments. This visit was a repeat of an earlier sitting in August. Same loud, inattentive bar tender. Staff sitting around a side bar table being loud and acting like children.--with a manager standing next to them... Last time we cancelled our drink orders as we had nothing brought that we ordered after 15 min. I often wonder how a mega Chain like this can ever close, especially in this area. However, I remember an Applebees being here when I first moved here. Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2

Kaye G.,"Grayslake, IL",20,3,,2.0,12/1/2017,"My husband and I typically love going to TGI Fridays, and usually, we dine in. Tonight, we both had a particularly long day and a longer night ahead of us so we decided to order carry out and we were very disappointed with our food. First of all, we ordered buffalo wings and they were basically inedible because each one was bloody inside. We also got two entrees: the grilled salmon and the 10oz sirloin. We asked for the rice to be substituted to the mashed potato for the salmon meal and we still got the rice and we asked for the sirloin to be medium rare and it was closer to well done than it was to medium. I'm not quite sure if it was because it was carry out that was the issue because we have never had this experience when dining it. It's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2

Bill C.,"Volo, IL",1,5,,1.0,2/27/2017,"Service was nonexistent. The hostess was in a corner that we couldn't see when we walked in and didn't greet us. We had to figure out who to ask for help. She rolled her eyes when we asked how long it would be. 15-20 minutes. A half hour later, we've been staring at four empty tables, three of them have been empty for twenty minutes, and nobody's being seated at them. We ask the manager, and he says ""we'll get to you when we can."" Other people were giving up and leaving, and eventually we did, too.

Jess B.,"Chicago, IL",14,87,1,1.0,8/4/2017,"To start, we waited over a half hour to be seated when the place was practically empty. It was pouring outside, so we just decided to wait it out. Then we were served cold food. When we asked for boxes for the food we clearly hadn't eaten, we were given the smallest boxes available. Our entire plates were full and we had to cram our items into the boxes. There was no apology, no offer to send the manager over though we did see our server speaking to the manager. It was unclear if they were ever made aware of the situation and by the unenthused look on their face while walking around the restaurant the manager probably wouldn't have been much help anyway. Won't be going back. $30 for food that is mediocre at best even when served correctly isn't worth the trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2

Nicole F.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,5,,1.0,7/28/2017,I had the Jack Daniel's Chicken with mac & cheese and fries. Literally everything was awfully.

Alex M.,"Antioch, IL",0,74,85,1.0,4/18/2017,"4/16/17: This visit was worse as compared to then.   At first impression the menus are filthy dirty and falling apart. (I will try and post a photo).   As for the meal let's start with the easiest thing to prepare: pot stickers, they were dry and shriveled in appearance - either over nuked or sat in the window too long. There was no sear on the bottom and was discolored almost as if they spilled some of the sauce on them while it sat in the window. The wings were okay but most of the sauce was on the plate and not tossed properly.  The parmesan crusted chicken was rubbery / fleshy in texture and had an odd taste. It wasn't spoiled it just had odd flavors.  The chicken fingers were stringy, salty, and dry. I'm assuming they no longer hand batter them to order anymore. They had the texture, taste, and appearance of being prepared and frozen.  I mean this whole heartidly I serioulsy wished we went to Wendy's. The meal would have been so much better. Never again will this restaurant be an option under any circumstances. Our waiter Jordan (I think) was very attentive and polite - he was the only positive part of the meal. We still tipped him well. We almost felt sorry that his tips are dependent on that poor, low quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2

TGIF food is a level better than chili's or UNOs or Applebee's. I feel like their food is much more ""trendy"" with new flavor fusions.  I come here for after party food with friends like I did for prom, homecoming, get togethers and all that because they're open late.

I called and the told me I had specifically say I wanted to add chicken.  That is not true Bobbie.  You can order without out chicken if you ask, but it comes standard with chicken.  He offered me a free app and kept trying to make it seem like my fault.  No thanks Bobbie.  Never eating there again.  The only thing worse than a wrong order is a bad manager who blames the customer!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2

Carl F.,"Effingham, IL",65,382,424,4.0,6/8/2014,"Glad I came and gave them another try.   It has been over 8 years since I've been to a TGIF on account my past experience has proven they were just a lousy place to come to... poor servers dishing out lousy food.  The menu, not surprisingly has changed over the years and I find more accommodating.    The server was upbeat, knew the menu, gave suggestions and was very tentative to our modifications to the menu items when ordering.  He came back to the table frequently and was able to balance well on being attentive and yet not bothersome.     The appetizer and main meal came out with good timing (nothing worse than getting the appetizer and two minutes later getting the main meal).  Each dish presented well, was to order, and at the temperatures you would expect.  Most importantly, it was very good!!    Granted, this is a chain store, so it can change from location to location, but as I mentioned, it has been some time since I've come to one and this location has changed my tune.    So, if you're in the area, I would highly suggest giving this location a try... perhaps I'll see ya there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2?start=40
Jen T.,"Beaumont, TX",105,78,187,3.0,9/7/2015,"TGI Fridays to me is like any other chained restaurants so I wasn't to excited about their food.  When we arrived with a party of 6, we waited about 10mins before being seated. I ordered a Chicken Salad which was huge for me.  It taste like any other chicken salad.  My family ordered some Burgers (sorry, I forget which burger) and they liked it.  They said it was very flavorful and juicy.   Overall, it was an okay experience.  The waitress was nice but she wasn't great.  She didn't refill our drinks until we asked for it.  On the day we went, when you order a Burger, you get a free one the next time you come back.  We ordered a burger to go while we were half way done with our food, and they gave it to us as our free one.  We didn't expect that, that was nice of the waitress to do that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2?start=40
Mark F.,"Gurnee, IL",178,328,16,4.0,7/30/2014,"We didn't go to Fridays expecting exceptional service or wow-me food but for something quick enough and a consistent flavor. Fortunately for us, we ended up with a guy named John as our server and everything went uphill from there. Our server, John, didn't do anything crazy like blow up balloon animals or breathe fire. What he did was better. He was attentive, informative, intelligent about the food, casually inviting during our experience and engaged our 3 year old like a seasoned pro.  We recently moved to the area and have been eating out a lot lately. We've encountered an array of mediocre and sub-par service wherever we've gone, unfortunately. Last night, we chose Fridays on a passing whim and I'm glad we did.  Our food was pretty tasty; we appreciated the reduction in meal sizes from the last time we visited a Fridays. Despite a couple of small ""meh"" things (menus were dirty and my beverage tasted flat like the tap line wasn't clean) - it was all overshadowed by John's awesome.  Even watching his interactions with the other tables around us reaffirmed how good he is at what he does - which is make their Fridays experience a memorable one.  We'll definitely be back more often now because of John.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2?start=40
Maria R.,"Waukegan, IL",0,5,1,1.0,1/13/2017,"Went out for a nice dinner with two family members and my friend. The waiter came by to clean our table and didn't greet us. He asked us to remove our phones so he could wipe it down. Came back to ask for our order of drinks, never told us his name. He all around had a terrible mood. My sister in law asked for a side of jack Daniels sauce that was brought to her along with her food by a waitress. This is when the evening got worst. When the waitress turned to leave the side of jack Daniels fell to the ground as the waitress had left it close to the edge of the table. Some splashed on my sister in law's jeans. It also splashed on the couple's items next to us sitting at the bar. They became upset as it is rightfully so. The gentleman stated his shirt was a hundred dollar shirt and began to be rude to us. I was quick to correct him in his unnecessary statements towards us. No employee ever bothered to come clean the mess that a few customers continued to step on and over. No employee came to offer anyone an apology. I had to ask for another jack Daniels sauce and when I did ask I was given unnecessary negative attitude by the waiter. At one point I saw his eyes roll. Needless the expectations have gone terribly down.

Caitlin C.,"Redlands, CA",1,27,11,2.0,7/12/2015,Some of the slowest service I have ever experienced. We waited 15 minutes to order an appetizer.

George H.,"Cary, IL",125,401,67,1.0,9/29/2013,"Went here for lunch yesterday and wasn't impressed - most of the food was good (bacon mac'n'cheese bites, corned beef sliders and Thai pork tacos stand out),  some was poor (the ribs were overcooked and mushy) and the service was really bad. We sat in the bar area so we could watch the games - it was not even 1/4 full, yet it took 10 minutes for her to take our drink order and another 15 to return with them.  We then ordered a variety of apps and entrees, informing her that the apps were to be served at the same time as the entrees because they were apps for those people and not sharing with the table. Our plates came out one at a time over the next 30 minutes - the apps didn't even come out at the same time!  Plus, to make things worse (if that can actually occur) our drink glasses were empty for so long we had to get up and go to the bar to get refills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2?start=40

Kevin N.,"Gurnee, IL",1068,357,1855,2.0,3/20/2013,"There's nothing particularly wrong with the food or service here. It's quite busy and very popular with families and boozers who want to whoop it up barside. The food is fine, the drinks are fine, and the service is a bit slow. What really gives me pause about the place is having to wait to get a table on a weeknight because there are so many families with kids. It's not really a good value if you have drinks. I'm skeptical about casual dining establishments which don't print prices for drinks on the menu. Beware of this practice. Two house margaritas and a special value entree with appetizer and entree with dessert had my total bill with tip upwards of $40 just for me. I want more for my money.

Nicole K.,"Spring Grove, IL",0,7,1,1.0,8/17/2017,"I'm sorry, this place was just awful. Our waitress saw us 3 times while we were there, and each interaction she was very abrupt and gave us very little attention. My mother waited 30 minutes for a cold appetizer she ordered for her main meal, and despite letting our waitress know that she intended to have it as an entree it still came out 10-15 minutes before my turkey burger. I asked for my burger to be done medium well and it was white it the middle. White. (If you haven't seen a turkey burger before, they are NOT supposed to appear white, so basically my food was either microwaved or severely freezer burned or something). The bun was soggy and gross. Our celery that came with the appetizer plate was ancient and turning white on the ends. My mother asked for bleu cheese with her food and got ranch. We waited 10 minutes for our drinks. 20 for refills. The manager was running around like a chicken with its head cut off and despite letting our waitress know that we had an awful experience we were given no apology, no one took responsibility for the awful meal, and we paid full price for inedible, cold 'food'.

Melissa G.,"Gurnee, IL",156,33,95,3.0,7/29/2015,"This place would've had four stars if it wasn't for the couple mess-ups on my receipts.  Friday's is my go-to place for a good meal and some drinks on special. Mondays and Wednesdays are my favorite days to go for drinks because they've got a lot of good drinks for only $3 that are normally around $8. Today I had a couple appletinis which were made very well - not too strong nor too sweet.  Whenever I go to Friday's, I usually order their 6oz. sirloin steak. For only $11 and two sides, this is a great meal! I always ask for my steak medium rare, but it always comes back a little more medium (which I don't mind). It's still better than a lot of places that serve steak and you're not really breaking your wallet here. My servers are always super nice, and I've never waited long for a seat when it's crowded (max: 15 minutes). In all my time coming here, I've only ever had one bad server. He was rude and forgot about my table constantly.  Today, I was just there for drinks and an appetizer. During the week, they've got appetizers on special when you eat at the bar. Their bar area has booths, which is really nice! I had the bacon wrapped jalapeños. I liked them although they were somewhat bland. The bacon was really sweet and it was only $5. When my server handed me the receipt, he made a mistake of charging my appetizer full price. When I brought it up, he was really sorry. This has happened to me twice at this location, but the other time was ages ago.  They've got Bingo on Sundays, which is always a hoot. But I've got to say, this is one of my favorite places to grab drinks with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2?start=20

Christina K.,"Round Lake, IL",88,79,44,3.0,3/30/2016,"The highlight of the meal was my Pink Punk Martini. It was on a $6 special, and pretty strong. I have a fairly high tolerance for alcohol and one drink got me buzzed.  If like to start by saying that I think there should be a better method for the all you can eat APPS. They would have to charge my two children (10,and 4) $12 each to share the endless appetizers. I understand why there's a rule. But really, my kids don't eat much. Maybe a few bites. It was cheaper for me to just order two separate appetizers (and we didn't even eat them all). It'd be wonderful if they maybe did a $5 charge for kids instead of full price.  Anyway, onto the food.  Spinach dip- Good. Better than others.  Pretzel w cheese dip- bland. Disappointing.  New York Strip- Under seasoned, lacked flavor, and quality. Was cooked correctly.  Mozzarella & Tomatoes- good.  Fresh Spinach- Good.  Burger- asked for it cooked medium and it literally came back burnt. No, seriously. Burnt. They made a new one. Daughter enjoyed the second.  Brownie Sundae- Really Good.

Then we ordered our food... the burger with wings that was cooked medium and the sizzlin chicken and shrimp. About 25 minutes after ordering, a food runner served my food which should have been done after the burger considering it was shrimp. Not only was my served food first, I also didn't have silverware on the table so that took ten minutes to receive. Five minutes later, the burger was finally served, cold along with the fries being cold. I've never been this upset with service. I myself am a server and I made it clear to my server that I came here to eat with my boyfriend, not without him. She knew I was upset and ASKED if id like her to get the manager... well you don't ask in that situation, you just get the manager when there is problem after problem from the minute you walk in.

Edwin M.,"Gurnee, IL",0,59,1,2.0,9/30/2012,"TGI Friday's used to be my favorite casual restaurant chain.  Back when I traveled heavily for work (in the late 90s), I would often seek out a Friday's location for those times when I just felt like having something good and reliable.  It seems that at some point, they changed and are now simply average and barely so. For some unknown reason, they removed the host podium.  This creates a rather awkward situation when entering the restaurant as there is no longer a defined place to go to ask for a table.  The last time I went, I was the only one waiting and an employee was on the phone.  I waited for him to finish up and at least acknowledge my presence, but he just hung up and left.  So, now I am left standing there with no one around and no indication of when someone would return.  I suppose that I could have eaten at the bar, but there were a few loud and obnoxious groups already in there and I wasn't in the mood.  I wound up leaving and dining elsewhere. I probably wouldn't have bothered writing a review except for the fact that this isn't the first time this has happened and other experiences at this restaurant have rubbed me the wrong way as well.  Hopefully, they can pull themselves out of their current downward spiral, but until then I will be making extremely rare appearances here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gurnee-2?start=60

Just ask yourself, ""would i rather eat something like this at a fancier restaurant?"" if your answer is yes, then do just that. It is TGI Fridays, not the chateau.

It tasted fine, just incredibly soupy and I soon regretted not sending it back. My husband said several time that if he had bought the Friday's brand freezer food at the grocery store and baked them himself, they would have been significantly better than what he got at the restaurant. That's real sad. Our server, he was super awesome, and attentive. He could tell we were dissatisfied, even though we weren't keen at all on making a stink. When we turned down the to-go boxes, he made a point to ask what had been lacking. I politely explained how the dishes missed the mark in a few ways.
