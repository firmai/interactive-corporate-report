6,Eric C.,"Bethlehem, PA",70,2,1.0,1.0,2012-10-13,"I went to the store in Bethlehem, PA for lunch, our server was absent most of the time but would make a very brief check on our table from time, staying long enough for us to hear what she said, then starting to walk away before we answered, on top of that we sat around for the first 5-10 minutes waiting to place our order, so when our server did come over she had little to no knowledge of the menu items, nor specials for the day, she did not even know the soup of the day! I placed my order and got the cherry limeade to drink, please note NONE of the non- alcoholic drinks had any kind of price next to them, then our cups of ice were brought to us, I say cups of ice because it was a cup full of ice with some liquid in it, I did not make a big deal of this, because I saw on the menu they give free refills, after finishing my first drink our server came around and asked if I'd like a refill I said ""Yes, Thanks"" when I should have asked ""Are you going to charge me for it?"" Because apparently only the limeades are an exception to their refill policy. That was all before we received any food, when our food did come out the soups were cold, my fries were luke warm, I didn't even bother to try my sandwich, because I was already disappointed enough. Other people in our group got a soup and salad which is supposed to come with breadstick""S"" we received one and after asking for more bread sticks our server brought out only one more. This is the 4th time I have gone to this store and I have never had a good experience there. The first time I had a bad meal and complained about it, the manager offered us a coupon for a free lunch, really it was a coupon for free, lukewarm, below mediocre food. I would never go to this particular store again and I am now skeptical to ever go to any TGI Friday's again. I would never suggest this store to any of my friends or family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=40,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005
46,Steve S.,"Beverly Hills, FL",12,141,9.0,1.0,2012-12-20,We've been to this TGI Fridays for lunch at least 6 times.  It is a real hit or miss as to whether you'll get decent service or not.   We won't be going back after our most recent visit.  When 2 business people go in for lunch and it takes 15 minutes to get your order taken and then another 1/2 hour to get your food it really blows your lunch hour.  I ordered a chicken club sandwich and my friend ordered spinach ravioli with chicken (don't remember the exact name of the dish).  I think there was 5 or 6 of the little raviolis (it was not a lunch portion).   Poor value for the money plus lousy service.  Not a good combination.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005
2,Lauren W.,"Easton, PA",17,115,5.0,3.0,2013-09-06,"When I started coming here about a year ago, I really liked the customer service. Doors are opened for you as you come inside. Sitting at the bar tables, the server clears away the menus, condiments, etc. with an able single swipe.  The food is quite good, and value priced. Especially if you are a points member and use the coupons in the newspaper. Happy hour specials are awesome, save $1 or more on beers, drinks, etc. It was heaven. Apps were half-priced. One time they gave out free wings. Why can't this happen every week on a designated night? My main problem, then, is that I love the mixed drinks. There's more ice than drink in my $8 mixer. And when you're mixing the liquor with multiple juices, there's no good reason to fill the cup with ice. I drink these in two sips. I have tried asking the servers for light ice, and I feel like a picky elderly person, and I'm really not either of those things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=40,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005

Tonight was a miss and regretful we went and not to other ideas.  Starting with the host totally confused.   Table service was prompt and considerate.  Order appetizer and a meal. And all delivered at the same time. When waiter is serving and apologizing at the same time was good indication of problems with kitchen.  Her salad was nothing to write about.

Bathroom is always clean and servers are quick and attentive. I love their stripes program. I've been disappointed once and annoyed once.  Disappointed because I had a coupon for ""buy one entree get one free"", both my fiancè and I ordered a steak entree with half a rib and I informed my server that I had a coupon for buy one get one. Once the bill came I told my server that the coupon didn't go through, that's when the manager came up to our table and said, ""the coupon doesn't work on steaks or ribs"" .... What?  It didn't say anywhere in the coupon that it did not accept steak or ribs! I don't have to write down how much the bill was because you can imagine how much steak costs there. But you live and you learn, next time I'll ask twice before ordering. Now I've been annoyed once because we've had this female serve, I always forget her name but whenever I go there with my partner and baby she only pays attention to my fiancè and gets a little TOO friendly. Like.. TOOOOO friendly to a point where my fiancè gets uncomfortable and I'm just there like, ""Yo, I'm right here.""  Now I'm not going to go all out and throw these hands but just respect a little.

28,Riza Jane B.,"Union, NJ",0,2,1.0,1.0,2016-06-09,"If there was a no star button I'll press it in a heartbeat. Before heading to this establishment two days ago, we were coming from a high school graduation and were extremely hungry. Upon entering the establishment and being greeted by the host, we told him we were a party of 15 and he unprofessionally rolled his eyes and let out a hugh sigh. Looking around the restaurant, it seemed there were a handful of customers and was not busy at all.  We were taken to our seats near the entrance and greeted by our waitress promptly and accordingly. It went completely downhill after that. After taking our orders (appetizers, entrees, soup, and salads) and receiving our drinks. The first plate that was brought out took 20 minutes after ordering, which was a french onion soup. The bowl was completely messy and appeared as if someone just threw it on the bowl without care. Another 20 minutes had passed and finally received our first appetizer and it was cold. The potstickers was dry and overcooked and the loaded potato skins had a miniscule amount of cheese and was dehydrated.  After waiting another 5-10 minutes, I finally went up to the host booth. The host seemed uninterested and was fiddling with his phone while on duty and told me he would check on it. The waitress finally came back knowing that we were complaining and angry. She kept apologizing and finally told us the food was running late after spending more than an hour waiting for the food. Mind you there were people that came after us and they already received their food and starting to leave. It wasn't crazy busy, but it was the right amount of customers to make you work a bit.  The manager finally appeared and looked disheveled. He didn't seem to care about the situation and said he will go check on the food. Once the food finally arrived, it was sloppily placed on the plates. Sizzling plates were no longer sizzling. The food was hard, burnt, and dry. And still we were missing one entree. The manager was extremely unprofessional. He was trying to seem apologetic, but felt no sincerity behind it. The manager stated that the plates were piling up and had no more counter space and that since we were a big party (basically putting the blame on us for coming there as a big group and making them suffer) it was difficult on the chef. But, looking at our orders it mostly consists of salads and appetizers. I've never been talked to in that manner by a manager and I was already livid. He kept asking me ""What more can I do for you?"" I responded back to him saying ""What more can you do?"" I am a paying customer, you don't ask a customer what to do. As a manager you troubleshoot and find solutions. His only solution was comping three of our plates and be on his way.  He also stated that the store hours were wrong on the website and that they were ""technically"" closed earlier then the 2 am time stated on the website. On top of that he wrote down the phone number to his general manager Chris Eppers. After handing me a piece of paper he turned around and never came back. But the number that was given to me was non-existent after trying to call multiple times the following day to file my complaint.  The manager I spoke to last night didn't even give me his name so I had to ask the waitress. Mr. Jake Swazdale (?) the way you handled yourself last night was a disgrace and it reflects to why the TGIF franchise is going downhill. This is a message to all the paying customers, be wary of this establishment and save your money and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

For example, I had been very excited to get some mashed potatoes, which I remembered as being creamy and delicious when we last ate here.

A few years ago, I stopped in with my parents. We could barely stand how loud it was. Seriously, the inside of a jet engine at full thrust is quieter than TGIF. Maybe that's what today's high schoolers want. Now, it seems to have, or is trying to, become a sports bar. Also not my thing. But ... Since I'm older than eight years old and I don't have a bedtime, I sometimes need a place to go after 10:00 P.M. TGIF is about the only place in the Lehigh Valley where you can get food after 10:00 P.M. (The TGIF kitchen is open until 12:30 A.M. The bar is open until 2:00 A.M.) That late (i.e., after 10:00 P.M.), no surprise here in the LV A.K.A. Tinytown, even TGIF is nearly empty. They turn the noise down to just below deafening. I like the food here. It's not great, but typical chain restaurant, i.e., on par with Olive Garden, Red Robin, etc. Given the customer-to-server ratio late at night, the service is a little slow, but not terrible.

The food was order and came out at different times. The brought food to the table which wasn't ours and left a plate we didn't order at the table.

He asks us if everything was okay he's like my name is teddy i'm the manager. I said we actually met before. He said i do look familiar, but the family as a group he couldn't recognize. So then we're like our server wouldn't sing happy birthday to her, talking about my niece. He's like ooohhhh wow i remember now. He said that was not a good memory it never sat well with me and i felt so bad, he's like here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take her meal off your bill her meal is on me. So then he walks away to the computer, he's looking back and forth thinking so he walks back to our table and says i did a little more then what i said i was gonna do. I was so shocked at what he did. I'm thinking he paid our whole bill, but still what he did was amazing and i pray that God blesses him for what he did for us. He said i took off 50% from your bill. He talked about how that night effected him, how it didn't sit right with him. He really felt bad about what happened to us, the horrible service we had from our last server. When he said that to us we were so thankful to him like wow what a gracious act that was. He apologized about what happened to us last time we were there. Teddy you really made our night, that was so amazing what you did for us. My whole family is grateful. Thank you Kevin our server& thank you Teddy the manager. We look forward to seeing you there again! Five stars*****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
18,Adrienne C.,"Moscow, PA",43,35,7.0,2.0,2017-01-04,"No go on the Bourbon Mahi mahi. Was cooked way to long cause it was tooooo dry. AND for $18.50...wayyyy to small. I'm not one to reorder, or send food back so I just let the waitress know. She day she would  tell the cook & manager. Ordered the rice pilaf and spinach as my sides. Rice too was dry and I told the waitress spinach and she bought me some melted  butter to put over everything.  Really not good. The strawberry ice tea was too watered down so I ordered less ice for second round. Worst meal at a TGIF at a In a while. Won't be returning to this one.. OH and a gentlemen complained to the manager while we were already done about the mahi as well next to our table. So don't order it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
16,Rob M.,"Brick, NJ",5,86,32.0,4.0,2017-02-18,"We stopped here after snow tubing in the Poconos. It's right off the highway. The ambiance is what we have grown to expect from Fridays. Fun atmosphere. The food was good. We did the $10 unlimited Apps deal. There's a list of Apps that you can choose from, the list is pretty long. We had a good experience and close to our hotel.

12,Sami L.,"Easton, PA",7,22,62.0,3.0,2017-02-28,"First time there last week. Was seated right away. Great waiter, he came by often. Made sure we ha plenty at the table. Lol. The manager came around  and checked on us. We got the $10 appetizers. They were fantastic. You have plenty of choices. So definitely worth it. I'd go back there again. Update. 4stars to 3.  Now went there a second time yesterday at 5. Got seated fairly quickly. Waitress was prompt at first. We ordered endless app again. The food looked tossed quickly together. Seems like the busier the less effort they put into it. Plus waited a long time in between.  If you decide to go. Do it closer to when they open. That way they put better effort into making the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
22,Paige E.,"Emmaus, PA",206,3,4.0,1.0,2017-03-12,"Myself, two friends and our 4 kids came here for dinner after we were at FreeFall. Our server name was Kelly she seemed very attentive when greeting us but not so much after we got our drinks. We asked for mozzarella sticks and boneless wings &  for our 3 kids meals as the appetizer came out. Then another server brings out the boneless wings & there's no garlic parm or buffalo, all the sauce was on size & that's not what I ordered & he didn't bring out our motz sticks. Then Kelly comes asking if we'd like to order any more appetizers & I told her we never received our motz stick. Shortly after we get the motz sticks (all four of them) our entrees come out & our drinks are empty & our kids still haven't received their meals I did tell Kelly & she then finally brought them out. The chicken tenders were very salty & our little girl did not want to eat anything after that. I also did not enjoy the parm crusted chicken so we just sent our food back & ate only the appetizer. The manager did help & discount the price. I love T.G.I. Friday's I just will never go to this one again or recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
24,Lindsay L.,"Boynton Beach, FL",245,9,12.0,2.0,2017-04-22,"Our experiences were just ""ok"". First time we went the server was friendly and manager checked on us. He gave us a free app/dessert card and checked on us through the entire night. The food was what was expected but a little pricey for corporate American cuisine. When we went back a second time, our server started off friendly but then when he saw we had a coupon he seemed to not care anymore probably thinking we were just there for a freebie. The parts that really bothered me are 1. I had two drinks. The first one was good, no issues but the second one was clearly way stronger. Being in hospitality for 13 years, consistency is huge for me. 2. The tomatoes that came with my mozzarella and tomato salad were frozen together.. literally. There was ice on them and completely grossed me out. For the price, there are way better quality restaurants in the area. I don't think we will be returning. Tomato popsicles aren't my thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

Knowledgeable about the menu options. Took our coupon (why we came in today) with no problem. We where seated in a timely manor. Had the JD Ribs, not bad at all.

15,Carl D.,"Wind Gap, PA",0,111,1.0,3.0,2017-06-18,"Not been to fridays in awhile. Menu changed since last visit with good choices and gluten free options too. I'd say 4 star food, 5 star waiter, but 1 star kitchen/management. We ordered potato skins (very good) which took awhile to get but when they showed up seemed like a small portion. 3 minutes later a much larger (full) portion arrived. Waiter apologized for initial 1/2 order which we ended up getting for free.  I ordered buffalo wing burger which was sloppily delicious!  Didn't come with a few wings as I expected and shown in the picture so I asked our friendly waiter who again apologized and went to the kitchen to fetch my wings. He returned explaining ""sometimes you have to fight for what you need"".  Waiter (Cory) was great. Food was pretty good. We'll go back. Hopefully they get more organized in the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
9,Gene G.,"Hempstead, NY",1,11,3.0,1.0,2017-07-24,"I only gave them one star because the drinks were decent. With that being said I can began to tell you about my terrible experience here. My family, girlfriend and I came to Pennsylvania because it was my birthday weekend and we were spending it together at dorney park. Saturday July 22nd the day before my birthday we decided to eat here after a fun day at the park. It started off bad because the restaurant was empty but for some reason we waited 45minutes for a table maybe because we were a party of 12 but anyway, We were seated and greeted by our server ""Amanda"". We ordered our food than began the longest wait for food ever !. Skipping forever and a day ahead our food finally comes and this is where the problems began. First off our appetizers and entrees came out together, they were giving wrong people the wrong meals and a few of the meals had some ""issues"" ill say. Me: ordered chicken fingers with a side of mashed and my chicken fingers were raw and had to be taken back to be re-cooked. My mom: ordered salmon and her side of spinach was still frozen. She didn't want to complain so she just decided not to eat it. My cousin: ordered a chicken sandwhich that came out over cooked. Our server was terrible disappeared for extended times often, we had to tell other servers to find her. I'll end my review with this, this was my worst experience at any restaurant EVER. I will never come back to this location ever!!! We constantly complained and no manager came to resolve our issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
17,Zachary P.,"Bethlehem, PA",6,15,1.0,5.0,2017-08-02,"Great dining experience at this TGI Fridays! Definitely much better than the other TGI Fridays location in Allentown by Dorney Park, which we tried just a month ago and had a terrible experience service wise even when the place wasn't crowded! Anyway, this location has speedy service and friendly servers. The food is excellent and the menu is large with many different options. Parking is great and surrounds the restaurant. The restaurant is also located in a prime spot, right off of Route 33 and just a few minutes away from Route 22. Endless Apps are also available here! If you're looking at reviews for TGI Fridays in the area and happen to be closer to the Allentown location by Dorney Park, take a few extra minutes to drive over to this location instead!

8,Parmjeet M.,"Hellertown, PA",6,19,2.0,5.0,2017-09-21,My wife and I stopped in to check out the menu as we are vegetarian we weren't sure if we could have anything or not. We took a look at the allergen menu and noticed almost all the food we wanted had egg in it. Just then we were about to leave but the manager John came over and sat with us and went over items that he could make for us. This manager was amazing he made us stuff that had no egg and made sure everything he brought out to us was delivered by himself. He went above and beyond for us and I really appreciate his kindness and understanding of our diet needs. John keep it up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
