194,Jeronimo L.,"Miami Beach, FL",49,71,64.0,5.0,2012-04-09,"Yummmm!!! Red Robin has arrived in South Florida and as a lifelong fan of the burger chain I couldn't be more happy. Having grown up in Cali, where Red Robin restaurants are in abundance, I have enjoyed the food at Red Robin since I was a kid.  My go to burger is the Banzai Burger, which is a hamburger with pineapple, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and teriyaki sauce.  It is messy, but absolutely delicious.  I order it 99.9% of the time.  It is served, like all burgers on the menu, with bottomless steak fries.  The menu also features chicken burgers, chicken fingers, clam strips, wraps, various appetizers, soups, and salads.  In addition to the main dining room, they also have a full-bar section with TVs.  Word on the street is that the chain is set to open a Pembroke Pines location this Summer.  Hopefully, they do well and continue to expand in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=200,3.4120000000000004,3.4120000000000004,3.4120000000000004,3.4120000000000004,3.412000000000001
256,Burny K.,"LOXAHATCHEE, FL",0,13,,2.0,2012-04-11,"so my friend told me about this place opening up 3 weeks ago. him and i made plans to be the first customers since many other places give out a prize thats worth while for waiting to be the first customer... well to start off the owners let us in about 30 mins prior to the official opening since they saw us waiting in the car since about 8am. (dont ask why). we were told by the owners we had free drinks, then someone else told us we could have a free appetizer. so when the bill came, sure we had our free appetizer but not drinks. we told the waitress to speak with the owner and to call him over here. i didnt really like the fact that they never came to the table, but yet again my friend was telling me to just forget abuot it and let it go. for being the first customer and got treated that way i would think twice... the food was good and so was the service.. but like i said. i basically got treated like a regular customer but just got a free meal like if i had a problem with a meal since places will discount a meal if your not satisfied.. it was the grand opening so they are supposed to give the best customer service to customers and if that was the best, then i have to say. i dont want to see their customer service in a couple of months... oh and even tho they have bottomless steakfries. id idnt like them. but the burger was awesome",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=240,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005

The wait was suppose to be an hour according to the hostess but it ended up being much less, thankfully we stuck around to wait. They have a system that you give them your phone number and they text you when it your turn to be seated. Great that they are keeping up with technology.  Okay the food! I ordered the Blue burger with bottomless sweet potato fries and the freckled lemonade. My burger was juicy and it was a big burger the sweet potato fries were not the best but they were fresh I personally like them crispier. Now the best thing was the endless refills on the freckled lemonade I even love the name. It was minute made lemonade with strawberries and it was really refreshing.  There was a huge amount of employees working that day so we were attended quickly. Our waitress had the refill coming without us having to act like we were chocking. Overall I was happy with the service and food and hopefully it remains that way. Will be back soon.

151,Shandi B.,"Davie, FL",70,218,133.0,3.0,2012-04-13,"We visited for lunch, so there was no wait.  I have been to Red Robin in Cali, so I knew what to expect.  I had the Whiskey River burger, which came with cheddar, onion strings, and bbq sauce.  I added grilled pineapple, which worked.  The burger was ok, but the onion strings were too greasy, and the burger itself was pretty ho-hum. The overall consensus at the table was that Red Robin is just okay.  Burgers are around $10 with bottomless steak fries (which are better than ok).   I guess it's nice to have one in the area, so when their commercials come on TV,  you don't have to feel left out.  There are definitely better burgers to be had in Miami, but if you are comparing this place to casual chain restaurants, Red Robin is one of the better ones.  I might stop in again if I'm in the neighborhood, but it's not somewhere I would travel out of my way for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=160,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
191,Jacob C.,"Miami, FL",512,464,184.0,4.0,2012-04-13,"Not quite as good as I remember when I went to Red Robin in Texas...but I've got to give them credit for having good service and being very accommodating. I showed up with a friend and we got a table for 4 because we had two other friends coming and we got our table in less time than the estimated wait time (maybe its just me...but it seemed like less time) even though there was a huge group of people waiting outside. After being seated at our table for 4 we found out that 2 more friends were coming and our table would not accommodate 6 people. We spoke to one of the managers and he informed us that he had two parties of 6 that had been waiting for over an hour that they were just seating...so it might be tough. He told us ""come and find me when the rest of your group gets here"". So we did and he managed to clear a larger table for us and move us over without any extra wait. I thought that was very nice of him. As for the food...it's not that it was bad...but it just wasn't as good as I remember. It could be because they just opened and they are working the kinks out of the system...but I wasn't ""wow-ed"". I do recommend asking for garlic fries instead of the regular fries...they are pretty darn good. I didn't see them on the menu...but they will give them to you if you ask (at no additional charge...but don't quote me on that)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=200,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248
126,Lissete D.,"Miami, FL",283,558,220.0,3.0,2012-04-13,"I love Red Robin and was really excited that we were getting one so close to home. I concede that this rating may not be very fair, since we did go on opening day.  But, it is what it is. We arrived pretty early, around 4:30. So the madness had not started and the restaurant was only about 1/4 full. There were TONS of employees milling around. All were smiling and friendly.  Service, however, was extremely slow.  We didn't leave til after 6:30 and by that time, they were on a wait. Our server was nice, all smiles but inexperienced. I don't think she's waited on a table in her life. Which is all well and good, but she should have had an experienced server assisting. Especially on opening day. We would sit waiting for stuff, including her taking our payment. My husbands burger came out first. Five minutes later, I flag her down and ask about mine. When it arrives, my cheese is no longer melted. Bottomless fries? Not quite. We did ask for a refill but she forgot.  Also had to beg for drink refills. When I asked if it was Happy Hour, she said that it was. Yet we did not get happy hour pricing on apps & drinks. Are not all locations the same in regards to Happy Hour? I wonder. Now the food is still good. No denying that. The freckle lemonade, my favorite, was disappointing though. Tasted like water with strawberries. I'll give it a couple of months and then try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=120,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

Once your table is ready they sit you right away. We tried the burgers which were delicious with bottomless fries, or you can switch them free of charge for a side salad, carrots, or other choices. Their drinks were a really good price too, lots of different choices. Their dessert portions are very generous.

Everything has been consistently great and this Miami location is seemingly no different.  My waiter was attentive even though it was crazy busy since I went on the first Saturday it was open to the public.  He got all the items right and they came pretty fast considering how crowded the restaurant was.

I was able to make it out to the sneak peak twice and then was there at 11:15am the day they opened to the public. My burger was perfectly grilled and tasted perfect. The burger isn't the largest of burgers but then again I tried to Monster (dbl patty) and it was actually to much. I'll stick with a single and just double up on fries.   The menu has some really great items but I highly recommend the burgers.

The burgers were a little greasy but packed with cheese dressing all the goodies, endless fries, and I ordered a freckled lemonade""light"". Yeah.. well....  The girl at the front told us 15-20 minutes but it took maybe 4 minutes and they take your cell number so they call you when the hostess is ready to seat you. The  lemonade was mixed with strawberry syrup and free refills(5.00).. my glass was chipped so the waiter brought me a new one and was very apologetic ... It took a really long time to get our burgers. I ordered a cheeseburger and my husband got peppercorn burger w bacon. His was very rich and mine was ok... The biggest complaint here was the wait and the noise. Its SUPER loud. other than that it was ok. Our meal came to 27.oo for two and I didn't feel it was worth it.

42,Sergio F.,"Miami, FL",765,1259,5162.0,4.0,2012-04-21,"The hype has a base of reality!  I was visiting some friends down south and had the chance to check out RR today. To be ""that guy"" I went for their teriyaki chicken burger (instead if the regular burgers they're known for). Size of the bread and chicken piece was pretty fair for the price, and the pineapple, teriyaki and cheese gave a good kick to the lean chicken breast.  My dessert of apple pie bites - basically apple pie nuggets - were hot, crunchy and filled with sweet apple filling. The caramel sauce was a nice extra bit of sugar. The endless raspberry lemonade was good, refills were on point, and the strawberries filling the drink tasted pretty fresh. Debra my waitress at the bar was pleasant and pretty attentive, recommending desserts without being pushy and going to get extra BBQ sauce for me when the busses overlooked it. She also told me they're planning to open a location later this summer by Pembroke Pines, closer to my neck of the woods. My only complaint is that the sweet potato fries could have been a little crisper. I couldn't taste a difference of ""sweet potato  taste"". I'm guessing maybe it was the same cooking oil. I also saw here on ""quick tips"" about the loyalty card which wasn't mentioned to me. Decor is a fusion between sports bar and bistro, with TV's by the bar and retro wine and food posters.

The wait lately has been ranging about 30-45 minutes, but for me it is worth it! They take cell phone numbers at the hostess stand so you get a text confirming you are on the wait list and a text when your table is ready. This allows you to walk around The Falls if the wait is a bit long. The atmosphere and decor are great! Lots of TV's for sports and really casual and laid back. The menu is absolutely delicious. One of their best features is ""bottomless drinks"" and ""bottomless fries"". My boyfriend ate an extra basket of fries at no additional cost. (Great when you are feeding a group of hungry kids or men!!!) My Royal Red Robin burger was DELICIOUS. I love burgers with a fried egg on top.  The only down side was that since this place is still so new they are trying to get their shipments coordinated. They were out of a few appetizers and a few desserts, but I'm sure that issue will resolve itself in the upcoming weeks. I must admit the service was phenomenal. Everyone was very attentive, happy and courteous. I know that I will probably be visiting again soon, probably this week! Reeeeeeed Robin...

There is an extensive menu with a variety of burgers, soups, salads, wraps and other sandwiches to choose from.  We ordered the grilled chicken sandwich because it was one of the few lower-fat options on the menu.  Many of the menu items look very tasty but have a lot of calories, sodium and fat; so you have to be selective if you are watching your weight and cholesterol.  The grilled chicken sandwich was good, what you would expect from a grilled chicken sandwich. The service was excellent; the waiter was very attentive and brought things right away.  The manager came around to check if everything was ok.      I looked at what other diners were having and the burgers and onion rings were very popular, as were the shakes and the freckled lemonade.  They also have a bar and serve alcoholic drinks.

My first time here at this location I gave RR 3 stars but after the way my second visit went I'm bumping them up to four.  The food was the same but the service was amazing. We had ordered a Queso dip app & a few minutes later a manager passed by to apologize because they had run out. We ordered something else to replace it free of charge. That is customer service! Our server, Jonathan, was on point with drink refills & passed by the table often enough just to let us know he was around if we needed anything without being overbearing. To our surprise, the queso dip arrived as the manager made it his mission to keep us happy & satisfied. The place is still new, so the staff is really trying hard to make a first/second impression on its guests.

They also chugged down a couple cups of Bottomless Chocolate Milk. I ordered the Burnin Love and my boyfriend ordered the Royal Red Robin. I liked mine a lot-- it was spicy but not unpleasantly so. The steak fries were very yummy. The Royal Red was just ok. I don't understand the point of a fried egg on a burger if it's overcooked and there's no runny yolk dripping everywhere. The egg was cooked all the way through and that was disappointing. The Freckled Lemonade was delicious.  The Mountain High Mud Pie was a bit challenging to eat-- ice cream but it was frozen to the core. But it was quite tasty.  The vibe is more like a Friday's than a fast food place. It was SO loud in there, honestly too loud. We could hardly talk to each other at our table. People were screaming everywhere. It was a little crazy-making.

Onion rings were pretty good. I had the mushroom burger with Swiss cheese and fries on the side. I sprinkled a little of the red robin seasoning sitting on the table on my burger for a little extra. Be ware with the seasoning a little too many sprinkles and you may actually ruin your food. Service was good they assigned  2 waitresses to our party (we were a party of 12). I thought that was helpful and it speed up the process. Drink order took a little bit to get to our table however the waitresses did make efforts to accommodate every possible need (specially with the young ones). Prices are  reasonable.

We wanted to try Ruby Tuesday as it opened a few months ago and we did not have the opportunity to dine there before but always saw a big crowd waiting for their turn.

Once we entered the restaurant, we found out that for a table for 2 could take 30 minutes.

I told my boyfriend, I am not waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a table rather go to another establishment in the mail.  Luckily, we got our table in the right amount of time. Our waitress was really nice and was aware that we were in a hurry to get our food and drinks as we needed to be back at the theatre. I had the lemonade and my boyfriend had a Sprite. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich which comprised of a tender grilled chicken breast with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions served on the side and a side order of French Fries. My boyfriend ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger which had Garnished with crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, pickles, onions, mayo & Red's pickle relish with American Cheese. It took about 10 minutes for our food to come. His cheeseburger was great. But I only got only the grilled chicken and bun only and not the other ingredients that the sandwiched contained. I informed the waitress and immediately she served me the rest of the ingredients. I found my grilled chicken burger too plain but I guess it is my fault. I did not order it with cheese or did not put any mustard, ketchup, or anything on it; just the lettuce, tomatoes, and raw onions. It was just ok. I did not want to order a beef burger b/c I already had one in the afternoon with my mom at another establishment. Oh well, but DEFINITELY got to give the kudos for the FRIES. They were hot, tasty and scrumptious. I ate them all. OMG! They were awesome which compensated my meal from the bland chicken burger.  I would like to go back again and definitely with more ample time before a movie. I a great experience anyways!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=160,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

Not a good first impression on his part. The milkshakes  were the only decent thing. After waiting another half hour, we got our burgers.

I agree in the ""Red Robin....yummmmmm!"" slogan, but the slogan should be this particular location, ""Red Robin....uggghhhhhhh!"" I love Red Robin, don't get me wrong with the three stars, but when this location opened they were just not trained properly nor prepared to open! I have been to Red Robins in other states so I have other Red Robins to compare to. I love the food and the service always is pretty good, but this particular location has terrible service while at least the food is consistent in flavor when compared to the other Red Robins.  We went for lunch on Saturday afternoon and the wait was an hour for a party of two. Okay it's Miami and its Saturday so this was expected. We were hungry and we didn't to wait so we found two vacant spots at the bar. It took at least 20 minutes for any of the waiters or bar tenders to even acknowledge we were there and when they acknowledged us, the bartender said ""Hi, we are a bit busy so could you give us a couple of I minutes."" We must have waited another 10 minutes and the waiter hadn't even taken our drink orders! After 30 minutes of what is supposed to be a faster service at the bar, we got frustrated and spoke with the hostess. They sat us at a table and at least our waitress at the table was pleasant and attentive. We ordered a pick two appetizers, onion rings and the fried mushrooms, which were as expected good. We ordered two burgers which were tasty as well. We asked the waitress for a milkshake go.  The runner (person who delivers food) brought our milkshake but in a glass cup thinking it was to drink in the restaurant. We told the girl that the milkshake was to go, so she went to the bar, grabbed a styrofoam cup and transferred the milkshake from the glass cup to the styrofoam cup. So now, the whip cream was on the bottom of the milkshake and the cup was only half full!  We called the manager and told him if he would sell the milkshake (we showed him how our shake was given to us) to a patron and he said ""no, this is unacceptable."" He ended up taking the shake off our bill and didn't even swap it out with a fresh one.  Overall, the food is good for a relatively cheap burger restaurant but if you want to have a pleasant experience, please save your time and go accross the street to Outback and I promise it'll be a whole lot better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=220,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.54,3.5600000000000005

He looked away when speaking and didn't do a good job of refilling drinks or asking us how the food was.Because they advertise as gourmet burgers and hype them up, I was expecting a great, amazing, one of a kind burger. The burger was okay. I've had better. There was not a lot of BBQ sauce on it which made it dry, however our server went AWOL and I couldn't ask for a side of sauce. the fries were okay, just average steak fries.

My mom ordered the Petit blue cheese burger with no chipotle mayo since she hates spicy and her burger came with EXTRA chipotle mayo. It was covered in it! Moreover, when we got the bill we noticed that if you order a Petit burger, you only get $1 off!! LMAO. Really? The burger was half the size of the normal ones and yet you're only taking $1 off?!  Wow...that's definitely something the menu needs to state or the servers need to tell people when they want to order that.  The manager, the entire time, was eating two tables from us while his employees often came up to him to ask him questions. It seemed so unprofessional!  And while my server was absent from our table the entire time we ate, he was in the back by the kitchen chatting it up with his coworkers (I saw him the entire time).

They soon came to get our entrees. Although the burgers may have taken 15-20 minutes for our table, I think that's reasonable. I loved my Cantina-Jack Style Tavern Double with Bottomless Sweet Potato Fries. It was only $7.99! And I paid about a $1 more to switch the Regular Steak Fries to Sweet Potato.

He apologized and said we wouldn't have to pay for the burger. Our server then finally appeared to place the check on the table and quickly left. The burger was not removed from the check and after waiting 15 minutes for someone to come by the table we just payed the check and left.

Hostesses walk around with Tablets and grab your info and they text you when your food is ready.  Secondly, out of all the times I've eaten here I've never ever had bad service. For the most part, all the servers are pretty young but the service is pretty impeccable here. They got my order wrong one time and they gave me two burgers in compensation lol.  Thirdly, they have a pretty decent Happ Hour. Beers are cheap, Wine is cheap, drinking is cheap and you're drunk pretty fast on a small budget. I always enjoy sitting at the bar with my coworkers and the environment and atmosphere is always so lively and casual. You'll end up talking to the neighbor to the left or right of you in no time.  Fourthly, you can adjust the menu however you like.  For example, next time try getting the Garlic Fries with your burger, they are AMAZING!

Their food however, mediocre at best. Their burgers, which is essentially their star items, are greasy, the buns always soggy and they fall apart. They hit the spot, but not for the price. Especially considering that their sides don't compensate for the price. Their fries are shit. However, the sweet potato fries are YUM, but they cost like $1.50 extra. It's too damn much!

In our quest to identify the best veggie burger in town, we had lunch here.  We needn't have bothered! First, the service was appalling.  There were plenty of empty tables, and several servers, but our waitress (a dark haired girl who identified herself as being from Rhode Island) seemed preoccupied, and not particularly interested  earning in her 20%.  While we died of thirst, she spent at least 10 minutes standing at a nearby table discussing The Heat.  We finally flagged down another server, who managed to bring us one drink for the whole table.  We shared.  When the check came, the Red Robin ""how did we do?"" ticket was missing...I guess she knew. The food itself wasn't stellar.  Yes, they give you ""all you can eat"" french fries but they are only slightly better than Ore Ida.  The veggie burger was really bready...a giant stale bun with a tasteless patty.  When I asked my dining companions about their meat burgers, they said, ""meh.""  Actually, one did point to the television that was playing a Checkers ad and say, ""See that  juicy burger for $1.99?  Now I feel stupid.""  Ours were at least $8 each.

There is mostly fried stuff and a million different burgers.  But, there was also a big array of salads and wraps.  The menu is extensive, so you don't have to eat anything unhealthy if you don't want to.  Tho, I would imagine if you ate here every few days, you would weigh 600 pounds!  The menu in the restaurant is much bigger than the one I looked at online. Our server was fantastic; a friendly and very nice guy named Tyler.  He explained everything and was really great.  I noticed that most of the servers are young, energetic kids; I like that. It is a burger joint, for sure.  But, I liked the fact that any meat burger can be substituted for a vegan Boca burger or another type of veggie burger - as a vegetarian, that's great for me. I had the vegan Boca burger and substituted regular fries for sweet potato fries.  It was delicious.  Fresh, soft bun and a gigantor Boca burger.  The sweet potato fries were great.  My one complaint is, the Boca burger was not grilled (it was cooked, just not grilled - to clarify).  So, it came out kind of brownish-looking. It wasn't as appealing as a burger on a grill, and it had no crispness to it.  But, it still tasted good.  It was like it was nuked rather than grilled.  That is just an aesthetics complaint, tho. My father had the ""burning"" burger, or something like that - some burger that sets your mouth on fire with jalapeno peppers.  He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfect for him.  He said it was delicious.  My mother had a crispy chicken sandwich which she loved - she had coleslaw that was very good. I liked the decor of the place, and it is very clean and lots of space.  There are tons of booths and tables.  We were too full to try any desserts. The prices are probably what you would expect.  The average meal (burger with all the fixins and a side of fries) averaged around $9.  There are plenty of sides that you can substitute the fries for.

We called ahead and learned that they don't take reservations and were looking at an hour wait. No problem, it's the birthday boys choice! What was a problem was the fact that for an hour and a half we waited with no check in from a manager or the hostesses. We had to check in 3 times and never once got a ""just a little longer"" or ""would you like me to send some appetizers over?"" I work at a restaurant and was absolutely livid at the lack of attention a group of 10 that was about to drop a lot of money got. Had we not been so hungry and eager to give the birthday boy a good night, we would have left way sooner, but alas. After basically begging for a table (nearly 1:45 min wait) we sat in a very bad mood. the saving grace was our waiter (i think his name was Colby? He's from N. Carolina)  He absolutely saved the night, the perfect definition of a good waiter. All the orders were correct, things came out as timely as they could, and everything was relatively tasty. My veggie burger was pretty acceptable, and the fried zucchini is really nice, though the fries are pretty lackluster and appetizers are fried to hell.

This one is a little different and the setup is far different than I was used to...  I must have been to the best of the red robins in PA because I wasn't impressed by this location. The food was hot but the service was close to non existent. I am pretty sure the bartender had tables in the back or was doing something back near the bathrooms. We only saw her three times and we were sitting near the bar. Some tvs so if you are  into sports you can prob get the bartender to change it to your channel on slow days. Things to try on the menu: BBQ Whisky Ranch Wrap Royale Burger (has an egg on it) Pros -You can order the burgers how you want them cooked. Medium for me. -Freckled Lemonade is like a dessert with real strawberries. -Bottomless french fries. yessir.

Ok, so here's what's bad: The service.  I don't what it is about Saturday afternoons, but Red Robin is not bringing their A-Team to the field for Saturday's lunch.  We've arrived after the lunch rush, so there's no wait for the table; it's as if our waiter goes off to the hinterlands between taking our order, and returning with the check.  Where was he in between when I wanted more water?  Or when my five year-old decided she needed a booster seat?  Please check on me at least once while I'm eating, preferably a few bites in BEFORE my food gets cold and I decide it's not worth it to send it back. Not family friendly.  I know there are a thousand t.v.'s on the walls.  They are showing sports; that makes Red Robin a sports bar, not a kid place.  But worse, and why Red Robin is only getting three stars from me: last time we were there, the table behind me was being bussed by two kids who were swearing strong enough to blister paint...18 inches from my kids' ears.  That's just not ok.  If you're in the public eye, you need to keep a lid on your drama and on how you choose to express it.   We may yet return to Red Robin, but only if someone in my house begs to go, which I doubt will happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=140,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.9880000000000004,3.1200000000000006

I ordered the clam chowder soup, only to be told 10 mins later, by Mandy that they would have to make a fresh soup which would take long so if I wanted to wait I could or change to a different soup so I changed the order to the french onion. Now the soup was delicious so I was happy. When our burgers finally came, my boyfriend had the shroom n swiss and it was dry and like he said,""had no love put into it"". I ordered the chili burger and although it was good, it couldve been a lot better. She also forget our sauces we had asked for our fries which was a chipotle which was a disgusting too much mayonaise flavor and a melted cheese sauce which tasted like fake cheese ...yuk!!!! The evening manager was great, he kept coming around (more then our waitress did) making sure we were taken care of along with the rest of the tables in our area. He truly showed great customer service. We've decided although he was great, our waitress and burgers weren't worth coming back and paying $11 a burger. I am sadly disappointed though cause I am a true burger lover . . .I guess we'll stick to other burger joints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=120,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.0480000000000005,3.1200000000000006

The prices were on par for ""gourmet"" burger joints in the area... but for quality and service I would choose a Five Guys over this place if I wanted a burger. Advantages this place has would be that it is kid/family friendly and also has a full bar. It's a restaurant that tries to have something for everyone but misses the mark on service.  The operations side is what needs work. When seated our table was cleared off but had oily globs and gummy residue all over it.  We were sat in a mostly empty restaurant that had one large party (10-15 people) and a few booths occupied and it took over 30 minutes just to get someone to take the drink orders (hey, we've been here staring at menus for a half hour, why not just take the complete order and try to make up for lost time?).  The drinks came out but then they never returned to take our meal orders for a while.  I wont get into the details of every little mishap, but we were there for three hours.

Had to break out the flatware and plenty of napkins. Onion rings were crisp and well prepared (but a bit greasy too) and the fries were great.

Let me begin with these two words...  HOLY HELL!!!   If you have not done so, please rent the movie, ""Waiting"" and you will understand that I just lived through that movie (you will also never want to go to another chain restaurant again). First, we walk in, wait 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us (BTW, there was a manager who just came off of a smoke break there the entire time, just never wanted to say ""Hi Bastards!  Table of 5 suckers for what's about to amount to a game of Russian Roulette?!?"". Finally, she finds enough digits on her hand to count to the #5, correlates that with the amount of menus required, argues with a lazy ass server who is angry that she's working on Sunday and wants to give her shift up anyway and finally gets us to a table.  We didn't know if we should feel proud or disgusted that we were surrounded by a carnage of unbussed tables and trash and we just happen to get the VIP treatment to the one good table in the section...  One side note, they were never cleaned during the entire meal.

We were starving and looking for a place to eat. We were nearby so we decided to head over. My wife called while we were on our way and was told there was no wait. We get there and there are 2 groups ahead of us, so we were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait. 30 minutes later we were taken to our table. There were 5 other groups of diners in the section that we were seated. We waited, and waited, and waited some more but no one ever came to us. We weren't given so much as a glass of water. I would've complained except that I never saw a server or manager in our section. After about 15 minutes we had had enough and got up to leave.

Waiter/waitress takes their time, they chitty chat with other servers letting food sit before serving, main course makes it to the table before the appetizers. Today we asked to have our burgers sent back and done again so they wouldn't be cold by they time we finished the appetizer and the second set of burgers didn't look as appealing and the first ones, as if the cooks were upset or something.

We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated at one of the booths. From what I could see, it's very clean and decorated with an assortment of vintage Americana on the walls.  Our server was Robyn. Very friendly and accommodating, as well as knowledgeable with regards to the menu and the company's customer loyalty/rewards program (yes, I joined and began earning points immediately!)  RR's specially is burgers, and the ability to custom build them to your liking. There are, however, other entrees available, along with a decent variety of salads and miscellaneous appetizers....VEGETARIAN options are available by the way!!! Prices range from as low as $3 for certain appetizers, to upwards of $20 for certain entrees. There is also a fair amount of beverage options (alcoholic and non) at very reasonable prices as well.  I chose the Smoke & Pepper burger, sans the bun (in an attempt to cut some calories) along with a small order of fries (which are ""endless"" by the way--carb addicts beware!). The burger was well done (as I requested) and very tender, seasoned without overpowering the natural flavor of the beef. The bacon wasn't as peppery as I'd expected, though. Lettuce was crisp and plentiful (in lieu of the bun's absence), and that worked perfectly for me!  Fries were fresh, not too soggy or crispy, and the made from scratch sauces provided (BBQ, ranch, spicy ketchup) all delicious!  We decided against dessert in an effort to not ""overdo it"" and I left with a happy tummy. I would definitely recommend this to the burger lovers out there.

With a name like Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, you would think that there's something special about the main act. Well, you'd be wrong. It was the most mediocre burger I've had in ages.  The atmosphere is sports bar meets Friday's, with a sprinkling of the old Bennigan's. Remember that place....? Uniformed servers with happy peppy attitudes run around with smiles on their faces while pushing burgers and appetizers on patrons. They must be on commission or something, because no matter how many times I said NO, my server kept insisting I try half a dozen things on their menu that I just wasn't in the mood for. They get an A for effort, but that's all. My order was simple, an Avocado Burger, no lettuce, with Onion RIngs and Fries. Now, I was expecting a nice fat and juicy ""gourmet"" burger that would wow me. Instead I received some cookie cutter patty that looks like it came out of a box from one those large wholesale frozen beef companies. You know the kind that you buy at those big box discount places when you have to feed fifty kids at a backyard pool party. The Onion Rings were good though....

95,Stefanie M.,"Miami, FL",85,143,259.0,2.0,2015-05-24,"We went to Red Robin for lunch today. We've been there several times before too, but never because we selected it. Quite frankly, we're not sure how or why this place is still in business.  We walked in and the rest of our party already was seated. They had ordered chips with some type of ranch dip as an appetizer. The dip was gross and I'm not sure why people eat that dip with tortilla chips. The chips were not fresh and had a bit too much salt. I ordered a Southwest chicken salad and my husband ordered a chicken wrap. The other people in our party also ordered salads. For some strange reason, although the restaurant was almost empty, it took 30 minutes for our food to come out. Then we had to ask our server for silverware so that we could eat.  The chicken salad had wilted pieces of lettuce in it. Aside from that, it was ok (meaning I guess I can eat it when I have to). I didn't have it with dressing, though, so I can't say whether the dressing it comes with is any good. My husband said that his chicken wrap had some strange sauce that he didn't like. We also tried some garlic fries which were brought to our table already cold and hard. We're not sure why they couldn't bring them out hot given that there was barely anyone in the restaurant. As we were leaving we noticed a bunch of people waiting for tables. That was quite puzzling, as we had a bunch of empty tables all around us, so we're not quite sure what those people were waiting for -maybe take out? Anyways, I think we might have enjoyed a Wendy's meal more than our meal at Red Robin. At least fast food restaurants are able to bring out food hot and fast.

80,Au-co N.,"Miami, FL",460,127,521.0,4.0,2015-07-01,"I have been to multiple Red Robin's before but this one was by far the best one I have ever been to merely because of their excellent customer service. My friends and I were looking for a place to have a few drinks and appetizers and we stumbled upon Red Robin.  Environment: Red Robin is a chain restaurant and they all have the same look with lots of pictures of oldies/vintage American pictures and a sports-like bar in the center.  Food/Drinks: I ordered a Vanilla Porter and the clucks and fries.   And now when they say bottomless, they MEAN bottomless. I was the only one that ordered an entree and yet the waiter kept bringing us fries for the whole table of 6. Their fries are large and soft. It tastes best when sprinkled with some of Red Robin's own seasoning salt. They also have bottomless sweet potato fries for an additional price. The clucks which is actually chicken tenders which were very crispy on the outside and juicy white chicken meat in the middle. One of my friends ordered a Blue Haze which is a limited time drink which I learned from my waiter that it is for Terminator Genisys that is coming soon. The drink is made out of Cap Mo, blue curacao, pineapple juice, agave nectar, sweet and sour and lemon. It came out in a glass tiki head with a cherry and was refreshing and not too sweet.  Service: Now I wish I knew our waiter's name, but he was by far the best waiter I ever had. He gave us all a basket of fries and also was very engaging. I ordered an Angry Orchard, which is on draft later on and he unfortunately told me that their container of Angry Orchard actually exploded when they try to get me a drink so I order a Blue Moon instead. However, some miracle happened and he salvaged a Tall Angry Orchard for me and also gave me a Blue Moon (on the house) since they already poured it. This waiter really went above and beyond his job description and I had to tip  him handsomely because of it. I hope all servers at this Red Robin are similar to him. Overall, I would go again, because who doesn't love bottomless food/ drinks (their lemonade!)! Also, although I didn't have a burger during this visit, I always liked their burgers. My favorite is their famous Blue Ribbon which never disappoints if you like blue cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=60,2.36,2.89,2.89,2.6719999999999997,2.678

208,Naty K.,"Miami Beach, FL",282,1043,10006.0,3.0,2016-03-16,"I'm sure you've seen the constant commercials about Red Robin and their bottomless fries.  It piqued my curiosity, but not enough to make a drive to the Pinecrest area just for a burger, but I decided that next time I find myself in The Falls mall (since the restaurant is located within the perimeter of the mall), I would give this place a try.  I saw a few of my Yelp friends checking in often, so I figured it must be decent.  Prior to Red Robin, there was a Hops restaurant (a casual dining microbrewery which apparently, abandoned ship in Florida altogether and settled in Virginia), and then the space had been empty for some time before Red Robin moved in. My opportunity to try Red Robin for the first time came a couple of weeks ago, when I took my daughter to a dinner date after we saw Zootopia together at The Falls.  The place was somewhat loud, so if you're craving a quiet or romantic dinner, this is definitely not the place for that.  It's more of a family-oriented restaurant, as they cater to kids with their videogame gadgets (more about that in a bit). The expectation is that people will bring children, so you will see quite a few as you dine in.  The ambiance and attire is extremely casual, so don't worry if you're in shorts and flip flops, most diners are too. As soon as you're seated, you will see this interesting device at your table.  As you look around, you will realize that all the tables have a device just like this one, and the device doubles as a way of getting your server's attention and paying your bill, as well as offering video games for children so they won't start to act out, due to boredom. They also have games for an older crowd, like trivia.  If you want to accept the services, you pay $1.99, which is added to your bill, and you have unlimited access to all the games on the little tablet-like device.  There is no obligation though.  It's a fun way to keep your kids entertained, and if you have a table full of kiddos, it can alleviate the stress of having to find ways of keeping them seated for an hour or longer.  My daughter likes playing on my cellphone, so this device was a welcomed alternative to having her drain my phone battery. As she happily played, I browsed the menu.  Wow, so many different alternatives! There were over 20 different types of burgers.  They also had a kid's menu which offered burgers, pasta, and other options.  Drink refills are free, which is nice.  My daughter chose the Little Red's burger, with the bottomless fries, and a strawberry lemonade to drink.  In case you're wondering what ""bottomless fries"" means, it means unlimited fries, as in you never feel the bottom of your plate because you're given so many.  You can get refills on the fries as many times as you'd like.  This is an interesting concept, and I wonder why Five Guys and other burger places have not copied it, because it's quite attractive, especially when you're starving and a burger only makes a small dent on your hunger.  I chose the sauteed 'shroom burger, which came with Swiss cheese as well.  Just so you know, each burger starts at about $10.  This one was one of the cheaper ones, and had mushrooms, which I love. My daughter said her burger was okay.  They bring ketchup to the table, but not mustard, which I thought was a standard condiment for burgers.  She asked why the burger didn't come with pickles, onions, or mustard.  I guess I will interpret that to mean she prefers the cheap dollar burgers from the fast food drive-thru establishments like McDonald's.  I guess she wasn't impressed.  I thought my burger was decent, though it had a good amount of mushrooms, and they were not the canned type either, which is a plus.  Was it mouth-watering or amazing? No. My mother makes better burgers on her barbecue grill, to the point you have juice running down your wrists from the seared meat because it is so juicy, thick, and smoky-flavored.  The Red Robin burger meat just isn't very flavorful, and it wasn't very juicy either, it was average, though not a flat pancake of meat as you'd get in a McDonald's burger.  I think the mushroom Swiss burger at Denny's is better, or comparable.  I did like the concept of the bottomless fries, but once I realized how busy the waitress was, it became more of a hassle and awkward to keep asking for more fries.  After ordering just one refill for my kid, I was done.   Red Robin is a safe choice for dinner and burgers, though not the most economical choice.  At the same time, it is much cheaper than neighboring Benihana, and no one can turn down a burger -- especially kids.  While it was not amazing and you probably can find better burger joints elsewhere, the convenience of having it within a mall, plus the cool videogame gadget makes it a worthy choice to consider when trying to decide where to get dinner.  I do think their burgers are less greasy and of a better quality than Johnny Rockets', for what it's worth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami?start=40,2.8,2.75,2.75,2.444,2.7699999999999996

There's mostly booths to sit at which I love. However, the experience is different each time I come in.  Today we arrived and there was no hostess at the front counter to seat us. It was only a couple minutes before a woman came out to greet us and sat us at our table. She gave us a choice for seating and got us our high hair for our son. She also became our server for our dine in experience today. She got our drinks out to us quickly which were delicious and we ordered the promo they are currently offering.  Both my husband and I were able to customize our burgers to our liking which is very appealing. He got an egg on his burgers and I skipped the buns and got them wrapped in lettuce so I could avoid piling on too many calories. It's always a plus when you can customize your order.

I signed up for their loyalty program many moons ago, and received an e-mail for a free birthday burger. I figured this would be a good time to try Red Robin again. I was pleasantly surprised that they had redesigned the entire store. The kitchen is less visible and there is a nice partition between the main dining area and the bar which is nice as the restaurant is very family-oriented and if you want to sit in an adults-only area, away from screaming babies, you can. I also like the Ziosk table management system. It is a wireless Android tablet that enables you to view the menu, play games (for a fee) and best of all, pay the check and calculate a tip with your credit card at the table, which saves a LOT of time and trouble. My birthday visit entitled me to a free gourmet burger. The offer doesn't cover their premium burgers or other entrees. I had an A-1 peppercorn burger which was ""just OK"". On previous visits, I have found their D.G.B. (Damn Good Burger) to be their best offering. My wife had their new ""Marco Pollo"" premium chicken sandwich with bacon, arugula, and tomato aioli which she really enjoyed. App of zucchini slices and jalapeño coins were good. I'd initially ordered their new app, fried ""Pickle Nickles""only to be informed they'd run out. What burger restaurant runs out of pickles at 6:30?! The bottomless fries were the regular ones and they are just MEH. The host seated us quickly and cheerfully, and the server was also quick and cheerful.

When down in the South Miami area to visit my folks, my wife and I do love our Red Robbin. Whether with a deal in hand or just a casual night out, the experience is nice. We are typically able to walk right in and sit right down, that is, after being greeted by the friendly staff right at the door. The parking lot in self-contained and vast, and being on the outskirts of the Falls mall, there is only a little bit of possible overflow from the large mall crowds Once inside and at a table, the drink and dinner menu is presented to you while being surrounded by an eclectic style of design and a bit of Americana nostalgia. This is similar to a lot of American style causal dining, sure, but Red Robbin is, well, Red all around for the most part, and alive and vibrant with color and flair. When we typically sit in the bar outskirts booths area, service is fast and friendly and attentive, just what one might hope for. The overall food quality is great, for the vast menu they do have and an option for all palettes. The of course is also a vast drink and desert list, but make sure to save room and not order too many extra sets of the endless French fries; yes, they are bottomless and the servers have no problem bringing a re-order as soon as the original plate comes to you.

200,Samantha F.,"Miami, FL",139,279,96.0,1.0,2016-12-04,"After receiving numerous emails a month regarding specials and seeing advertisement around the local mall, The Falls. I decided that it's been too long (almost 5 years) and dealing with too many holiday shoppers, I figured I deserved a burger. With my mother, we figured Red Robin sounds good. I was way too hungry and tired to wait to drive to the nears Five Guys. Upon arrive, the hostess seated us quickly at the bar. Our waitress came over and introduced herself--very friendly. I did take time ordering my burger, I had to get an appetizer to hold me off. Our waitress seemed to be catering to other tables and anyone who order a head to pick up. To me it seemed like she was the only person working the bar area, when there was 7 tables--plus take out. That did not look right. After a very good while, our burgers came. My mother order the guck burger and I order the Red Robin loyal. I was starving at this point, I cut my burger in half and barely taking my first bite to find my egg undercooked. In my defense, I order the burger with the sunny side up egg. I know the yolk part is going to be runny--that's normal. However, my yolk was not the only thing undercooked. What came out of my burger in my first bite was the raw white part of the egg (the part that can make you sick). After waiting to get my waitress attention, I informed her that my egg was undercooked, some one gave me the wrong fries, and the previous server who brought the food forgot to give my mother her honey mustard. Waiting, waiting, and more waiting, my waitress even asked after what feels like 30 minutes for a hungry person (my hunger weighs more than my disgust level), she was shocked to learn that they did not bring my food out. I think you see where this goes. I had to ask my mother for a piece of her burger our of sanity. At this point, I did not want my food, I just wanted to leave. If it was not for the waitress's friendly attitude, I would have put my money on the take and walked out. When I saw my ""new"" burger, I tried, I honestly tried to stomach at least half the burger. I could not. I felt sick with looking at the about of mayo that the cook put on it. I'm a mayo girl, but having too thick layers of mayo would make the religious mayo eater sick.  In my honest opinion, I felt that paying $33.12 was on worth my service or the food. I did tip the waitress because again her friendly attitude and her willingness to fix the situation. When I met the manager towards the end of my meal, I just wanted to leave. I do not even know why I took left overs. They ended up in the trash can.  The only reason it received a star is because there is no ""no"" star option. I'm disappointed by the fact that its been almost five years since my first review and I have to update it with a completely negative of my first review.

To my surprise, the hostess informed me that the wait would be around 15 minutes. When I asked why? She said the kitchen was running behind. When I asked if we could sit and at any of the nearby empty tables to look at the menu and at least order drinks, she said she'd check with management. She returned and said ""You cannot be seated at this time. You're going to have to wait."" I was flabbergasted. I was not the only one complaining. Others seemed just as dismayed.

I returned today after my friends convinced me to give it a second chance. Since I ordered a simple cheese burger last time I thought this time I'd try something different. I ordered a burger called Burning Love. This burger was advertised as being ""hot"" and ""spicy"" with fried jalapeños all over the burger. Not only was it not "" hot"" and ""spicy""  but it yet again was cold along with the fries, and the fried jalapeños on the burger were absolutely burnt. It was like biting into ash.

Just silly not to know for customers.   Then one of my daughters got sick and threw up after she ate.  I'm not blaming the food because it could have been a number of things.  Thank goodness I had plates around and some napkins.  Waitress came back and I said that I apologized as my daughter had thrown up and I cleaned as much as I could.  If she could bring more napkins.  As I'm still cleaning and organizing so she doesn't have to deal with much throw up she never comes back with napkins.  Then she starts to clean the table next to mine and I'm asking very upset where are my napkins and she's like oh I forgot.

I hope they fix it!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.32,2.48,2.48,,2.416
17,Jules V.,"Miami, FL",41,19,19.0,2.0,2017-12-16,"This place gets 2 stars only because I enjoyed the flavor of my burger. However the service? Holy crap. I am not one to complain about little things and I even let certain bigs things slide. Tonight, my order was never put in. I informed the person who brought everyone else's food because our server was nowhere to be found. It then took 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge it and tell me they had put order in and it would be right out. We were never offered more fries for our ""bottomless"" fry orders. A dessert was brought with no utensils. We asked for a spoon and 10 minutes later had to walk over to kitchen and request it again. We asked for a to-go box that came 20 minutes later. They have these tablets at the table where I assumed I could pay because we weren't offered our check. Then when using the tablet the server comes around and says that we shouldn't use the tablet because it doesn't split the checks correctly(I guess I was supposed to magically know that.) someone at our table orders a refill it's brought to the wrong person. Seriously the list goes on. This place was 80% empty and I mention that because if you're swamped and the place is packed, I get it, servers work their assets off. But this was the last time I go to Red Robin. Shame because I really like their burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.32,2.48,2.832,,2.416
10,Leslie R.,"Miami, FL",25,33,,2.0,2017-12-19,"Came for dinner at 8pm on a tuesday night with my family. The service was great, but the food was mediocre. The fries were cold, my margarita was not filled to the brim, the toast that came with my clam chowder was stale. My first time, and probably my last time-too many other options to settle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.32,2.48,2.82,,2.416

3,Vanessa L.,"Miami, FL",339,116,260.0,4.0,2017-12-22,I love coming to Red Robin when I'm craving a burger. Why you ask? Because the service is always good quick and they have a large selection of tasty burgers.  When you come in normally there is a server greeting you at the front.  This one time I came I was waiting for the rest of my party so I decided to sit at the bar.  There was NO ONE at the bar.  Literally no one.  The bartender was there and he appeared to be cleaning and whatnot.  Completely ignored me.  Like I wasn't even there.  I tried making eye contact and waving him down.  nothing.  wow.  I sat there for about ten minutes when I realized this guy was not going to take my order.  So I stood up and luckily my party arrived.  I was quickly seated and thank god the experience got better after that. My family and I were sat down and the server came immediately (Andre but he said we could call him AJ). He quickly asked us for our order and made some recommendations.  Thanks to him I had one of the best burgers ever!  They also had what seemed to be an infinite amount of fries.  Thanks to AJ the experience improved tremendously.  If it weren't for him this place would of gotten a 2 just because of the service. The burgers are always good here.  I have been here a few times and their specialty burgers are amazing.  I always love trying different combination of flavors for burgers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.56,2.55,2.836,,2.5540000000000003
2,Camila O.,"Doral, FL",184,34,73.0,4.0,2017-12-25,"Im surprised at how much Red Robin has improved. They have entirely revamped their menu to offer a great selection of burgers and sandwiches. Their manager is very sweet and attentive, as well as the waiting staff. They have endless fries with your order which you can swap for endless salad if you want. I am so happy I decided to give this restaurant another shot!  Great place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.56,2.58,2.836,,2.572
0,Vanessa E.,"Homestead, FL",5,56,34.0,5.0,2017-12-28,"Love this Red Robin location! It's in a perfectly central place, and right in the Falls Mall shopping center. We've been here a few times already and it's never disappointed. We always receive a smile and friendly and attentive customer service from every team member we encounter.  Their burgers are delish, as well as the onion ring tower appetizer, and of course, their milkshakes! I've had the Oreo one a couple of times and it's always very creamy and delish. Everything is served hot and fairly timed.  Will be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.72,2.59,2.844,,2.6420000000000003
1,Eddie G.,"Miami, FL",0,1,2.0,1.0,2018-01-01,"Our table was forgotten after the order was placed. The waitress totally disappeared and the bartender had to attend us. Later our waitress showed up at the table next to us , but never came to ours. So the bartender didnt come either since its not his job.  We were left totally unattended. 20 minutes later our food is delivered by the kitchen personnel. My burger had rotted avocado slices. If i dont remove the bun to put ketchup i would have never caught the rotted avicado and it would end up eating it. Thank goodness i saw it. I called the bartender over for him to please address it to the Manager whom didnt seem to have any concern about it. So i requested new gresh cut avocado and that was brought by another employee. After I affixed the ingredients myself, In the end I didnt eat all of it.  The burger meat was cold and hard! Overcooked! Terrible Service! Terrible food! And no Concerns for the customer! Like most businesses,  They start really cool then the responsible Company Asset allows it to rot down! If youre gonna take a job, make sure you get it done right  That goes for all positions. If not, let someone else who is willing to do it right have it. * What good is the menu if you cant provide the right service. *",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.6,2.59,2.828,,2.5940000000000003
6,Huston C.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,3.0,2018-01-13,This place always has poor service every time I walk  in here. Very poor management. The only I come here is because it's convenient when at the Falls and the food is good.  10 minutes still no server....ugh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-miami,2.56,2.59,2.82,,2.5780000000000003
