Carmen P.,"Bronx, New York, NY",28,1,,2.0,1/14/2018,"Let me start by saying, that it was freezing in this establishment. When I bring it to the attention of staff, it was told to me that has been this way for the past 3 weeks. Then , I order appetizers... pop stickers always come with some sort of roughage such as salad and because it was half price it came without it. I ordered a cup of coffee, and I actually stuck my finger inside of it , that's how cold it was. When my order was brung to the table, the waiter did not remove the appetizer plates leaving us cramped up with our platters and empty dishes. Overall service was horrible. I felt like I was having dinner in the North Pole. Strongly would not suggest this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers

Laura D.,"Bronxville, NY",185,15,3,1.0,7/26/2017,"This is probably the most disgusting place I have ever been to. I understand if there had been a rush that just left and the place was a bit disorganized but it seemed like there was no one there for a while and the place had not been cleaned since they opened in the morning. No issues with service because we didn't even get to that point. The host pointed us to a booth, there was ketchup on the booth and food residue from the previous table where he place the menus.  The floor had so much dirt in it it was hard to walk by and not notice how disgusting everything was. As we walked towards our booth we looked at all the tables, everything so disgustingly dirty OMG.

Tenisha D.,"Queens, NY",52,49,189,2.0,10/29/2017,"I came here with a business colleague this evening for dinner. It was rainy Sunday late afternoon and not that busy. Although we were seated quickly it took someone from the waitstaff 15 minutes to come and take our order. When the waiter finally came he took our drink and food orders at the same time. It took forever to bring our drinks and water. The appetizer I ordered was good (green bean fries) but then it took a while to get our food and when we finally got it it was barely warm. While waiting we notice some questionable things; ice buckets sitting out in the open for dust and hair or whatever else to fall into; waitstaff talking and checking their phones while supposed to be working; another table next to us the waiter got their order wrong and they were complaining; then someone came in and was asking for the manager because he was waiting almost 30 minutes for a pick up order he placed over the phone. He asked to speak to the manager and was very upset. On top of our observations, our waiter neglected to ask us if we were ok or if we wanted more water and when he asked if we wanted a second round of drinks he asked for ID, but never got it from us when we ordered our first round of drinks, smh. I love Friday's but this was a bad experience. Maybe today was a bad day to go but I won't be going to this location again, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers
Letier S.,"Bronx, NY",2,4,5,1.0,12/26/2017,This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. The waiters were nasty and taking forever. They dropped other people's plates when giving the customer's their food. The waitress had a nasty attitude. She sneezed on my mom. The last straw was when the waitress carried 4 of our cups without a tray holding them against her breasts. Worst service ever. I felt like i was going to eat in a homeless shelter. We picked up and left because we were afraid of how the food would arrive seeing how nasty and uncleanly the staff was. Never going here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers

I think I overheard the hostess discussing her outfit for that evening with another employee.  On top of that the floors and tables weren't even clean.  Our waited was William I think that's his name. He was very polite but just slow as can be for a empty restaurant. Mozzarella sticks took about 30 minutes to come out and our entrees about the same. Had to wait forever for a refill on water.

Jay T.,"New Rochelle, NY",115,13,16,1.0,12/13/2017,"I use to enjoy coming here instead of gun hill but last couple of visits it's been like a sinking ship. I went there with my son figured no one was there a quick in and out there should be minimal wait time for the food to come out. Proven wrong again my kid ordered chicken tenders and fries and pot stickers and i had to mention to the waitress bring his food first because he was hungry and yet still mines came out first anyway and that was still disappointing . The middle of the pot stickers was cold , plating was bad and my sons food took forever as well . Mind you there ain't no one in there but me and and couple in front us not busy at all. Now the best part is that over all i had at first the empty app plate on my table waitress came by ignored it I'm like ok then entree plate empty ( now they all stacked up) she came by because i had ordered someThing else ( she saw plates and ignored it) then she sat a few tables over to play on her phone but no time to take the dirty plates off my table ???  Like wow and gain NO ONE WAS THERE NOT BUSY AT ALL!! at this point i didn't want to talk to her i just paid my bill with the ziosk and that's that.

I stopped in for a quick lunch before work and was seated at the high top tables at the bar. After being seated I had been approached by an employee who informed me that the server serving me would be coming in between 7 and 15 minutes, so I was given the option to wait or sit at the bar, mind you I was on a tight time schedule. I moved to the bar and the food came out about 15-25 minutes, yet all I ordered was mozzarella sticks and sliders. The mozzarella sticks marinara sauce was dry and the buns of the burger were hard.

Christine R.,"Edenwald, Bronx, NY",16,23,10,3.0,1/30/2017,"Not all TGI Fridays are bad but this location in Cross County was very different. First let me say that we were seated in the bar area. When I tell you that the waitress behaved like she didn't want to be there that would be an understatement. We ordered our food and drinks. First of all, she slammed the small plates with napkins on the table. The delivery of the drinks was with the same attitude. Lets not talk about the delivery of the food - we waited and waited and waited and waited. People that came in after us received their food and we were still waiting. The waitress never came back to say anything - at first I thought she went home. I had to ask another waiter to go get my waitress and my goodness she really had no personality. She definitely wasn't trained in customer service. When I inquired about my food order she stated that it was coming - I was saying it's almost an hour. If I wasn't hungry I would have left. When my food finally arrived I really didn't want it but I tried to make the best of it. When it came time for the check I just looked on the handheld device that they had on the table and got my total and called her over and paid in cash. When I think about it I should have used my debit card on that device and paid and left I'm sure she wouldn't have noticed that we left. I recommend that the mangers do a better job at training their wait staff because I'm sure this is not the first time this happened. I gave them 3 stars for the food not the service - sorry TGIF in Cross County - you're not there yet",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=20

Cold late and to add insult to injury we complain that the order is not complete apparently the waitress says she put it in the system so we should wait an additional 30 mins for beans and the wrap and then she takes the next order. sweetheart if you cant get mine correct why are you taking another. The manager wearing a blue jacket came out said im sorry ill send everything right out after 20 mins we decided to leave i said just bill me for what we ate he sends out a bill for the items i never got only after i complained was it taken off.

Carolina T.,"Tuckahoe, NY",165,64,216,2.0,6/11/2016,"Coming in on a Friday afternoon there was no wait time. I was unaware that there was outside seating, I wish we would have been seated outside but its ok next time. The tables now have a tablet that you can order certain foods and drinks on them! They even have games for 1.99 each for children! The tablets also have a bell where you can call the server over which is neat.  The menu was fun it had a lot of pictures of certain dishes. They offer children a page to color with crayons. I ordered the Jack Daniels New York Strip with fried shrimp and two sides of fries. WELL, one server told me i got the flat iron instead but my server insisted it was the new york strip. I have ordered this before and it was definitely the flat iron. I got one side of fries and the shrimp is the only thing that came right in that order. They forgot the Jack Daniels sauce with my meal.  The food was good, fries are crispy, and steak was flat so it wasn't juicy! I always love fried shrimp!  When it came to the bill they tried to charge me TWICE for the shrimp on the bill. I told the server she immediately took the extra charge off the bill. The server was nice. I just knew that they gave me the wrong order, charged twice and they charged me for a new york strip instead of the flat iron (flat iron was much cheaper).  I was not impressed with the service and not only was the order wrong but the bill was wrong and if i did not check the bill that would of sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=20
Bella V.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",27,11,3,1.0,11/18/2017,"Terrible service the place wasn't even full and we had to wait an hour and a half to even get drinks because apparently they ""didn't have any clean cups"". Our food never came and when we asked for the manager he gave us attitude. Around ten to twenty minutes later we called our waitress so they can at least bring us our silverware however when she arrived we asked about the food and that for some reason upset her I guess because she threw the ""silverware"" on our table. Another complaint I have is they gave us plastic sporks like any fast food chain not like the restaurant they appear to be. We finally had enough and decided to leave and at the door we discovered another group of around six people leaving because of the poor service and they even told us that they saw around three other smaller groups leaving also. My father decided to go back and voice his complaints to the manager and asked security to get him but he was dealing with a already complaining client at the bar, he didn't even show face to my father. Terrible service. And the drinks that took over an hour to arrive...my lemonade was watered down to nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=20
Julio S.,"New York, NY",63,47,1093,2.0,5/17/2016,"OK, most of these chain restaurants all have decent food. I didn't come here expecting to be blown away but did want everything to be cooked well. I had to cut the edges of the ones I ate bc they were not cooked, it's like somehow they only managed to cook the middle.  The Jack Daniels sliders were only tasty after I asked for a side of the sauce and dunk it before every bit.  The chicken fingers were the star since they tasted the way they should have along with the fries. This is why I try to pick a family owned restaurant when going out for food since you know they will put some love in preparing your food. I will say the staff was pretty nice and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=20
Lovely L.,"Yonkers, NY",0,6,1,1.0,9/2/2017,"Not sure why I keep giving this place a chance. So let's start by saying... staff here definitely need training. Last time I came our server wanted to joke around with other staff instead of tending to our table(which took him 25mins to even acknowledge us)... this time around the sarcastic server lacks proper training yet again.... professionally. Bless her heart she tried. But word to the wise do not refer to a woman as ""sweetie"" or ""honey"" and her date as ""sir"" and ""mister"". Bad look and quite disrespectful. DRINKS-- I indicated what drink I wanted (a drink that the very helpful bartender always makes for me) welp when ready the recipe the server tells me oh I don't know about this and that she's not sure how to ring it out. I explained I had it before. She leaves and returns to indicate ""let's just go with a safe route"" and presumes to place an order for another drink. 25 minutes later. Still no drink. When they finally came the pineapple mojito taste like medicine and the passion fruit tea was someone's creation gone SO WRONG. Any question on why the long wait... well we watched Meanwhile as the bartender assigned to make drinks for the servers flirts instead of works. FOOD -- oh it will come out hot. OUTSIDE. Inside. Not so much. When I placed my order for my food and made the adjustments needed she told me I couldn't do it become they don't accommodate such needs anymore. Well what do you guys do?!? Not to mention the food came out before the drinks and of course the order was not correct. Burgers were bland and rare when I clearly ordered medium well!!!! As we sat patiently waiting for our food. We watched as 4 staff members attempted to pick something floating out of a customers drink before bring it to the table (see attached photo)All this to avoid making another drink. I think the only thing they managed to do right was sing happy birthday for a staff member. This place needs serious help. It's run down... staff isn't professional or trained and management is no where in sight. LIKE EVER!!! Oh wait. There he is. Watching the game... smh.

So my point I know how Friday's was 5 years ago it was Amazing.  I visited Friday's last night and I was excited because I used to work there. Wanted to go because it's convenient too.  Let me tell you, as a WARNING. DO NOT GO THERE!!! It's extremely gross...everywhere from the front door to the bathroom the place is disgusting.   I got there at 9:00 pm me and my son. So a table for two. The girl at the front the Host were so unorganized and petty. I was sitting for the longest and apparently she had already call my name when asked what the hold up was. She sat everyone before me and I watched her do it too. So she made me wait saying she'd alreasy sat the table.  I'm became irritated but still wanted to stay and eat. Didn't sit until 9:45 pm.  Bit when I get to the table the chair is disgusting I mean filthy dirty I said to the host the chair is dirty. She comes to wipe it and it smears off but it's still dirty I removed the chair. Then I'm uncomfortable the table is right on me the one behind that  I literally have to sit outside of the table from my child.  Then we go the Bathroom, smh OMG! HORRIBLE, it's so disturbing how could people even eat there it may as well be a dirty club. It's crowded everything is filthy and old. Maybe they don't have enough staff because the appearance and service was no where to be found. After leaving the bathroom so grossed out my son said he'd seen two roaches crawling up the wall.

A friendly waitress took our drink order after walking back-and-forth with nothing in hand for about 20 minutes We ordered appetizers which came 30 minutes later. The pretzels and cheese were very good but as we looked around everybody else was eating  even though we were seated first. At first it was amusing because my friend and I just kept watching  the waitresses and servers walk around with nothing in hand and no one even attempted to pick up a bucket or clear these filthy tables all around us. I thought we were being punked because everybody was walking around but nobody seem to be working . We witnessed people walking out due to the very bad service ( or no service at all)the restaurant was a mess 80%of the tables were dirty the entire time we were eating our lunch. But the best and the funniest part is my friend wanted the Oreo ice cream dessert which is the only reason why we even came to Fridays and stayed through the bad service. She received a plate with a melted moosh liquid ice cream that couldn't be eaten with a spoon maybe a straw ?? we laughed so hard. The waitress said they were having trouble with their freezer but clearly someone put this Oreo madness cookie under the heater because it came flat and completely melted how she served this to us was beyond ridiculous Please do not go here and waste your money it had to be one of the worst service ever in my 53 years on the planet",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=20

I think they made a mistake in the kitchen and gave me sirloin. That would have been OK except that the meat tasted bad. I let Mark know and he got Arthur, the manager. Arthur was awesome. He apologized and asked if he could get me something else. I said I would go for another steak. A whole new plate arrived with everything fresh and the steak was great.

We then waited about 40 minutes for our entrees (the floor was not busy). The table next to us seemed to have been going through the same wait, since they stood up and left when the food finally did arrive, without touching/eating anything. The presentation was terrible, we both ordered the steak and lobster. I ordered mine with broccoli and she didn't tell me there wasn't any until she brought the dish out with only mashed potatoes. We hoped the presentation didn't reflect on the taste. Unfortunately, it did. Our steaks were supposed to be medium well, and were over well done, dry, and lacked in flavor. Our lobster was not cooked well either, it was very hard to eat. I planned to order a dessert when I walked in, but decided not to risk it. Everything about the experience was very disappointing. We will never come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=60

We all work and some of us have kids. Veterans Day was on a Wednesday so it's went on like any day. I got out of work and met up with veteran friends at this TGIF because it was away from the city.  Anyways. Long story, short. They stop serving veteran meals at 3pm. We all left and went to Applebee's because they served meals for veterans all day and night. I know it sounds booshie...

One of my co-worker wanted place her dessert order a head of time and when she ask the waitress about the items on the dessert menu the waitress didn't know it and then told her to remind her about her dessert because she will forget, umm what??, red flag # 3. We waited for 40 minutes with no food in sight and all we ordered were 2 salads, an appetizer platter and a hamburger.   We decided we were going to leave, while talking to the waitress her attitude was very nonchalant so we ask for the manager who proceed to apologize and tell us that she see that our ticket time was 12 minutes. Now how is that possible when we have been waiting for our food for 40 minutes. We tell her that we will pay for what's on the table and she brought us a check for everything we order. Common sense would say take off the items of the food that never made it to the table which was damn near everything. We sat in this restaurant for 1 hour and ended up going back to work hungry.

One waitress, who has a shaved head, was on her phone the whole time. I am pretty sure she was still on her shift. Regardless, it took FOREVER to place our order. We waited another 10 minutes for sodas. We then waited a half hour for our burgers. The customers around us were not pleased either. Some of the staff worked their butts off, yet the ones around us today were terrible. At one point, one of the cooks and a lady in a red shirt (not sure if that means she is a manager) went outside, while we were waiting, to see ""their friend"". As a person who was worked in customer service for a few years now, this is not acceptable. Luckily, the seasoned fries were good. I made my own burger, and I asked for it medium well. It came out pretty rare, but it was a decent burger. I will not be coming back to this location. At a time where it was not busy at all, the staff failed to serve. I suggest trying out the locations in Scarsdale, where I had a pleasant experience. Also, I love how NONE of the managers noticed the slow service. Do they not care?

How hard is that? You put dressing with salad. Not that hard. I called and the manager apologized, and issued me a credit for the salad. I was pissed but thought, oh well, things happen. Tonight I placed another order and guess what... no chicken! I usually don't write reviews but this place is ridiculous. This is salad 101 and if they can't get that right just imagine what else these idiots are screwing up.

Tamara H.,"Bronx, NY",19,19,99,1.0,3/26/2017,"I've been to this location before and it was actually pretty decent, but tonight's visit was overwhelmingly horrible. First off - it took about 30 mins before we were seated. We had a party of 3: 2 adults + 1 child, it didn't look as though they were very busy, but what I could tell is that all of the staff seemed to look as though they were all very confused and stressed. The looks on their faces expressed that fully. After being seated by the host, we sat at our table for another 15 minutes without a waiter/waitress ever coming by.  A busboy passed by and I had to ask him if he could please send a manager over. When the manager arrived I let him know that we'd been sitting unattended for some time and he had to find someone to cover our table. Long story short: we made simple orders without any substitutions - in fear of them getting messed up, seeing as how the table right next to us seemed to be having difficulties with their order, nevertheless our order still managed to come out messed up and flavorless, even down to the dessert we ordered. Not to mention, while waiting for our food to come, we were approached 4 times by different servers with other orders, asking if we had ordered them. I don't know who this particular location is owned and run by but there is definitely a lack of everything.. I'm scared to even give this location another try. P.s You know a place is bad when your waitress tells you ""I can't specifically tell you what's in your meal, because the cook we have does what he wants to do from day to day, he just throws stuff together""!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=40

I must say I was so disgusted and disappointed just one foot in to the restaurant.  I walked in to no hostess at the host stand, all the bar tables were open and dirty as if every table walked out at the same time. I walked through the restaurant looking for assistance and a waitress was cleaning off the tables herself.  The hostess finally appeared we asked to be seated at a bar table and she said it would be a wait. Me asking why if everything was empty and just needed to be cleaned off.  I asked how long would the wait be for seating,  she then responded ""i dont know"". I immediately walked out the restaurant.  I was so turned off with the response and lack of partnership that I knew if I waited for a table service would be just as ruff.  I would never walk foot in here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=40
Dana M.,"Yonkers, NY",2,37,20,2.0,2/22/2016,"Went here today for the first time, around 2pm... Quiet, not busy at all! Place was clean except the seats in the booths were all ripped! The hostess tried to seat us in a booth where the sun would be shining directly in your eyes, something that would not be fun while trying to enjoy your meal! When I asked her if we could be seated else where (mind you only 2 other tables were taken at that time in the same area) she rolled her eyes and made a ""annoyed"" sigh!! Really?!? Sorry did not realize all of your tables were taken!  To the food, tried the endless apps, which are 12$ per person! Not ""just"" 12$ as advertised every where, but ok no big deal they were good!  Decided to have a burger today, try one of their new ones, the New Smoke Stacked Burger! It did not look anything like how it was pictured in menu (which can be understandable)... But unfortunately it was missing a few of the listed ingredients!! These are the ingredients listed in their menu : ""Beer-braised sausage & onions, Asiago & cheddar between two fresh hickory-smoked burgers with sweet Memphis seasoning, melted sharp cheddar, Tennessee BBQ sauce, BBQ ranch aioli, applewood-smoked bacon and coleslaw.""..... The two patties have to be well done, you do not get a choice! The sausage tasted like a cheap sausage from dunkin donuts, and was very small! I had no onions on mine but I guess they made up for it with the one pickle they did throw in it!  To the service- our server Ceana, was not good at all!!! Could not recommend a good burger to try, everything she said was ""eh its pretty good, I like it, its ok, people order it""... Nothing truly special or something to rave about! Not good when their own employees can not say anything impressive about the food... She did sell the endless app, threw in the $12 each thing at the end while I was already ordering so we barely heard her, and honestly were confused by the way she was trying to explain it... Simple! For 12$ each person you get to choose from 6 or how ever many options and have endless refills... Not to hard! Also, never once did she come to see how we were doing or if we needed anything! We had to get up several times to find her! She had us and one other table in our section, and that couple was waiting just as long as we were and left just unhappy as we did!  Another thing- they were training a new young girl and 2 tables away from us, a female and male were yelling at her and made the poor girl cry! IN FRONT OF ALL THE CUSTOMERS! What kinda employer does that?!? Go to a private area to have a discussion, do not do that in front of paying customers!  So at the end of our meal, we were in a happy agreement that this will not be a place we will be going back to! And establishment becomes successful from the quality of their food and customer service! To me they both go hand and hand!

The music was so loud you could not hear yourself speak. The orders took a long time to arrive and when the food finally came the food was terrible.  I ordered a steak, cooked rare, with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was over cooked to a medium well to well done. The waitress took the steak back and eventually brought another one which was completely raw!  The meal also came with a lobster tail. I should have known something was wrong because the moment the plate arrived it smelled very fishy. The lobster tail was not only a tiny portion but the texture was as if it had been frozen prior and defrosted in a microwave. The texture of the lobster was complete mush.  My family ordered the ""Friday's shrimp"" with French fries. The shrimp were very salty but that's not unusual for fried food. The French fries were also good.  The manager was nice enough to comp the meal and apologized to us, as well as provided us with two coupons for a free appetizer. I appreciate that she did the right thing.

My brothers chicken had more fat then actual meat. About 15 minutes after I placed my order for a French onion soup, they came back and told me there was no soup.

Rebecca B.,"Bronx, NY",4,63,9,2.0,3/30/2015,"This TGIF location gives franchises a bad name.  It's in a busy mall complex (Cross County) and it has a strong brand name... so they are always busy. The fact that they have a built in base of customers at the mall has allowed them to perform on a sub-par level and not see repercussions to their business.  Let me just start with the line.  We were there about 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and we were told the wait was ""about 25 minutes.""  OK fine.  The waiting area was filled up with people and even people waiting in the vestibule and outside (in the cold!).  We went inside to use the bathroom and saw that there were TONS of empty tables throughout the place.  Many of them sitting with dirty dishes on them which weren't bussed for 10-30 minutes!  There were more than enough tables to accommodate everyone in the waiting area.  It is either a case of poor time management or understaffing a busy location on a weekend, or most likely both.  Now on to the service.  While we could see all these empty tables, many waiting to be bussed, at any one time there were 2-6 staff members hovering around the hostess stand.  One was the hostess, one was the girl who seats tables.  Then anywhere from 1-3 waitstaff were standing around there talking with the hostess.  And a tall man in a suit who appeared to be a manager but I'm really not sure because I didn't see him managing.   We had a waiter station near our table and several times there were 2-3 waitresses standing there talking for minutes at a time.  Also, when I went into the ladies room, a waitress was standing in there texting on her phone. No wonder they couldn't fill all the tables - all their servers were TOO BUSY to be serving them! The food... We had 3 burgers and a steak.  The burgers were pretty tasty.  The fries definitely old and soggy, which was a shame because they looked like they would have been great if they were fresh.  The steak was pretty good too, not Peter Luger but better than I expected at Fridays.  One burger we ordered was the Philly burger - we asked for it without bacon and bacon jam (?!?) and when it arrived it looked nothing like the picture (I know, no food ever looks like the picture but this was ridiculous.)  We check it and realize that they didn't put the philly steak between the two patties - the entire point of the Philly burger!  So we had to send it back and ask for a new one.  That was kind of a pain but our waiter James did get a new one, properly made, and it looked MUCH better and tasted good too.   Our waiter, James, was actually pretty good, I have no complaints about him.  Friendly and fairly attentive.  I'd recommend he gets a job in a more reputable establishment because this one is managed terribly!   Oh, one other plus, they had half price appetizers so we got two orders of Buffalo wings for the price of one.  I'd give the wings a B+ but definitely worth what we paid for them.

James F.,"Yonkers, NY",0,13,2,1.0,2/1/2016,"This is, quite possibly, the worst TGIF I've ever been to.  I understand that not everybody can be happy all the time, but part of your job, working at a restaurant, is to be pleasant to your customers.  1. The hostess sat customers who arrived after I did. When I made mention of it, they explained that they were on the list, pointed it out, and basically proved that they were on the list after me. Then, I was seated immediately.  2. There were many available tables, yet the waiting area was filled with people. When a customer asked why there were so many tables, but no one being seated, she explained that they didn't want to seat anyone while the kitchen was backed up. So, basically, the kitchen staff couldn't keep up with a restaurant that wasn't even filled with people.  3. Cleanliness. Although, I had been seated, we noticed that the table behind us hadn't been cleaned off yet. It stayed that way for about a half an hour.  4. Waiting staff was inattentive. We finished our drinks and appetizers and we sat with empty cups, and plates for quite some time. When the waiter did remove our empty plates, he just moved them to the next empty table, instead of bringing them to get cleaned.  5. The wait for the entree took nearly 40 minutes. I ordered Cheddar Mac n cheese as a side. It was basically macaroni covered in grated Parmesan cheese. The garlic steak fries were only about 5 fries covered in some kind of sauce, and the bourbon chicken was just a small piece of chicken with seasoning on it. Not bourbon.  The person I went with got lobster tail and steak. The steak, lobster, and mashed were all cold. After waiting as long as we did for our food, that meal should have been immaculate. He was so angry, he sent the food back, and the waiter didn't even apologize.  The manager came and expressed his apologies, but did very little to make sure we'd leave feeling better about the situation.  6. All else failed, we went to Red Lobster, where my buddy got a fulfilling meal, piping hot, and I got my dessert there.

The service is the worst, the waiter took our appetizer plate before we finished it and the he went and lied saying that he asked if we were finished and saaid we responded yes. He never asked and never got a response. He also lied by telling the manager that we asked to speak to her when we never did. Overall I feel that tgif is not as good as it used to be, say five years ago and before.

Went there because the week before I had visited the one at Palisades Mall and loved their Jack Daniel's ribs (juicy fell off the bone); that was not the case here. Aside the table being a bit sticky, it took to 10 minutes  after we sat down for the waiter to acknowledge us and take our drink order. The ribs were HORRIBLE, I had to use a steak knife to cut them, very dry and hard to chew as if they've been sitting there for a week and reheated, the waiter never came back to check if we needed refills or to clear the table; I called him over to return the ribs and ordered the JD Burger, which took another while. Well, it seems the cook was on a roll, because the steak was well done (I asked for medium well), chewy , and the cheese was already ""glued"" to the meat as if it was sitting at the warming station for a while, plus the bread was stale.

The apps were a( chicken flatbread) little cold for my taste and the chicken skewer dish was ok. Place has a sluggish feel to it,can't understand why, Dessert was fine the Oreo madness of course.

Vanessa S.,"Bronx, NY",18,18,1,3.0,9/26/2014,"3 star service about 70% of the time. I come to this Friday's often because I work in the mall. Service is very dependent on the bartender or waiter that you get.  There is a handful that are exemplary. One that even has my beers ready when she sees me coming in.  One security guard recognizes me as a regular and always finds a seat for me by the bar.  There are definitely ""safe bet"" appetizers you can order. The wings with the bone are good,  ask for the jack Daniels sauce on the side for a tasty tangy twist. Mozzarella sticks vary by the day. Happy Hour (10pm-close everday, all day on sunday) is the best time to go. Later at night and on the weekends can get busy and finding a place by the bar can be difficult. After a few cheap drinks in your system, you'll hardly care about the appetizers you're eating to prevent you from getting too drunk.  No, this will never be a 5 star restaurant and the service is subpar to say the least. But for quick drinks, it does the job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=120

Yonkers F.,"Yonkers, NY",0,6,,1.0,7/30/2015,"Awful service, my family members and I walked in yesterday afternoon we waited inside for 15 minutes and left because nobody was there to get us a table. This place is a mess, really Fridays? Your supposed to be a great restaurant, whats wrong with the manager at this place? Do they exist? You don't think people pay attention to the way you treat customers? I am sick of being treated like this especially in Cross County a newly renovated mall. You need to SERVE your customers thats your job to SERVE US! Stop thinking that the customer needs to wait for you, we are not getting paid YOU ARE, so serve us and stop being distant and rude to your customers. I feel like this place does not want the people's business, now next time I come in to a Fridays there better be somebody at the front ready to serve me and my family.

April C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,10,,1.0,5/31/2014,"This was my second trip to this location, and THE LAST! The first time my husband and I went it was a disaster. We stood at the hostess station where 3 people ignored us, then we sat in the bar (where it was filthy). I ordered Jack Daniels sirloin medium and they brought it out Well Done , TWICE. By the third time I wasn't even hungry anymore because of  all the drama. The manager Joe came over and apologized for all the troubles, he gave us a few $5 gift cards and said that they were just very busy. He bought me a beer that took almost a half hour to come. I also must mention that all 3 steaks were on the bill.  We decided to go back when it wasn't as busy and it was the same thing!   A dirty restaurant, Steak well done, cold fries, mushy veggies, and the waiter Dennis brought my sons ice cream melted all over the sides of the dish (I wish I took a pic).  And again both steaks were on the bill!

Nai W.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,7,,1.0,3/23/2015,"I've been coming here since I moved in the area 4 years ago. Let me first start off by saying I have been a waitress before so I know the struggles of being asked to bring several things to different tables and trying to remember it all. It took 45 minutes to bring Jack Daniel Wings and my son's chicken fingers kids meal. Upon receiving this my son requested mash instead of french fries. We still received french fries but that was no biggie. We overlooked it, reminded him that I also asked for honey mustard as well and he brought the mash out right away. 20 minutes later he brought out my husbands other appetizer. I placed my order a little later than my husband and son but there is no way appetizers were taking so long. At this point I assume a friend of his came to visit so he not only talked to her but he also sat at their table. He then got up walked passed our table pivot... looked at the table went to the back and brought it out immediately. Still no honey mustard. I then asked for to go containers because we had been there for so long. He brought it out to us. If a table is asking for to go containers then you may want to bring the bill as well. Instead we waited another 15 minutes just for him to come back to the table and bring it. He then continued to converse and my husband ended up taking the bill to him.  Worst Service Ever. I ended up bringing all of  the food home. I wish I could have gotten a refund. DO NOT EAT HERE! GO TO GUNHILL RD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=160

We were seated in a booth and when asked for a high chair were told that they couldn't give us one because it was blocking the aisle which is understandable. The waitress pursued to move us to the table next to us where there was another waitress counting sugar packets, she told our waitress not to sit us there because she was going to leave and didn't want to do anything else. She then moved us to the other side where the waiter started cursing at the other employees, asking who the hell sat us there. He then proceeded to walk around the restaurant like he didn't notice us. He looked me dead in my eye a few times. He went around asking who the F sat us there. Everyone looked confused and nobody said anything. We sat there 25 mins and nothing not a word to us just kept walking around cussing up a storm. My husband didn't notice a thing because he was to busy looking at the menu. I got so tired at looking at this guy disrespect us talking smacking and ignoring us so I told my husband to let's leave and explained why. While we were putting on our jackets (40 mins after going in and being seated) the waiter had the audacity to ask us if we were okay.

Alex W.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/8/2013,Okay so when we first arrived we noticed that the hostess left from the front counter. So thinking okay cool she will be back in a few. We waited about 10 min to be seated and thats only after the lady behind us went and flagged down a employee. A couple of employee's passed the group by clearly no concern for their business or any kind or a tip. After the girl returns she never apologizes for making us wait. She then starts walking really fast like she being chased to seat us.She never welcomes us to fridays makes eyes contact or nothing. She seats us at a table that was dirty and broken. So at this point we took it upon ourselves to move to another table. At this point we are left with dirty menus that are sticky. Sanitize sanitize sanitize the guys comes takes our order cool smooth sailing. Then the food comes SMH Why are my sliders burnt 2 out three and dry talk about over cooked. Only 1 burger was good and cooked properly. It took extremely to long to get the check. My friends steak was overly cooked she stated she would chew it like gum. There never cleared the plates from the table.  The service here was very disappointing for the price they charge. The service I received here was like eating at a self service buffet.

Off the top of my head I can't really think of a time that I've been immensely disappointed and that's including any of the locations.

We asked for the check and it comes the the late bug infected drink not only charged but double billed! When pointed out and asked (because I was clearly not offered) for some sort of compensation for the wait and the drink the manager incredulously told me he replaced the drink so what's the problem!

nasanta n.,"New York, NY",1,34,,2.0,10/10/2012,"It was a crowded Saturday evening, and a party of three was pleasantly surprised to find their estimated 15 minutes wait cut down to less than 10. The server was pleasant and friendly. The wait for the meals was a bit long. The alcoholic mango drink that one of the party ordered tasted watered down with only a faint taste of mango. The requested medium rare rib eye was not as rare as that one in the party liked, but she liked the sauce. The other two in the party did not care for the sauce. The potato strips with a sour cheesy sauce were pretty good, and so were the vegetables. The fries were a bit salty but still good. A second rib eye dish was ordered with a specific request to make it medium rare a bit rarer. Another long wait, and the server was less attentive, busy with the other customers. The second rib eye dish - well, it was practically a disaster. The vegetables were way too salty. The potato strips barely had any of the cheese sauce on it. And the rib eye? Despite the request to make it rarer, it was more on the medium well done side. At least a third of it was plain fat. And the sauce that the one had liked was practically nonexistent. When the server finally came to ask if all was satisfactory, a polite complaint was made. The party had had a coupon that would have made the cheaper rib dish free. Instead, the second rib eye dish was free. At least that was something. For the writer, the establishment gets 2 stars. She would not mind coming back. For that one? She was very, very unhappy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yonkers?start=180
