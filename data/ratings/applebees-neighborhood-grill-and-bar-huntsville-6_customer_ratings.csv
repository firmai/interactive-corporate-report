0,Candy A.,"Huntsville, AL",0,12,,5.0,2013-11-06,Excellent service and great value.  You wouldn't think steaks on the 2 for $20 would be good but they are TENDER.  And cooked correctly every time.  I frequent this Applebee's about 3 times a month.  The servers are attentive.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  They even have a brownie and ice cream dessert for .99 Cents!  The menu changes enough to keep it interesting yet they keep the good old standards.  Another great thing about this place is that it is OPEN LATE.  There are very few non-fast food not a smoky bar restaurants in Huntsville to eat at after 10 p.m.  You can order food until 12 or 1 a.m. I think.   The management checks on the customers and you are always greeted at the door and made to feel welcome. Lively without being LOUD.  I like this Applebee's--can you tell?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-huntsville-6,,,,,
2,hugh j.,"Auburndale, FL",0,2,,1.0,2014-09-11,"the worst dining experience ever. not only do i want my money back, but i want my time back. that's 90 minutes i'll never get back. the food was gross except for the fries - they managed not to screw up fries. the ""crosscut ribs"" were chopped up bits of old blade steak full of bones and tiny bone shards, fried i guess, and then smothered in a syrupy ""sauce"". maybe they have better food, but i'll never know.  the service was VERY slow, and not just for our table. please, dear reader, spend your time and money anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-huntsville-6,,,,,
1,Gregg H.,"Zeeland, MI",17,22,5.0,1.0,2016-10-16,"Started off with a 10 min wait and dozens of open and I cleaned tables. Next, waitress didn't know the menu. Then, 1 of 3 meals showed up with the appetizers. It was cold, but the plate was hot. Other meals came later. Fries were soggy, waitress forgot drink refills. Oh, and the place was filthy. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-huntsville-6,,,,,
