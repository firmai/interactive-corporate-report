Thank god for those kids eat free coupon.

Our waiter looked like he was annoyed with the fact that we were sitting at the bar area with 2 toddlers. Yes I know it looks horrible but hey mommy's are entitled to at least one drink.

Dryed out tacos with pitted brown avacado   Watered down pico salsa and boiled un seasoned shrimp,.... I kindly looked at the waitress and sad really,..  She looked at me like I was crazy and was surprised when I rejected both plates,... So the waitress takes it back, and instead of making new ones the cook took the boiled chicken Breast and slapped it on the grill then back on the same plate with the now cold grey mash and cold watered broccoli back to my table,..... I said with a smile,.. I kinda knew you would do that,... So I paid for my tea,... And still left the retarded waitress a tip,...

This is commercialism at it's best. So when you get crap customer service, just makes it worse. I asked for water like 5 times, ok probably 3 in actuality but that's a lot considering it was like 100 degrees outside and the water never came. This was 3 different times throughout my meal!

151,Ritu G.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,9,,2.0,2012-10-27,"I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal...but when you're hungry and in a crunch, what can you do? As far as chain restaurants go, Chili's is usually pretty decent.  They seated us right away, which was great but it took awhile for the waiter to come and take our orders.  We had my one-year old nephew with us, so we needed to get a kids meal for him. We ordered the mac and cheese, which was basically boxed kraft mac and cheese. Don't get me wrong, growing up I used to love that stuff but I just feel like they could have had their own homemade type of deal. So we ordered our drinks and our meals. Luckily we asked to put a rush on the kids meal because my nephew was getting hungry. Good thing we did because our meal took another maybe 20 minutes after his meal came out. I started picking at the mac and cheese...what could I do?  Here's the kicker though... Finally our meals came out and we started to eat when I saw something crawling down the wall from the corner of  my eye. When I looked over I didn't see anything but I asked my sister-in-law who had a better angle to see behind the stuff on the table. She definitely saw something. Of course, I slid over to the opposite end of the table as far as I could go. She told me not to think about it, but I couldn't help it. Finally the little creature landed on the table. It had two really long antennae. We tried to get the waiter's attention, which eventually he did and grabbed the bug with the napkins sitting on the table.  Eek. Not what I had in mind when I went out to eat.  A few minutes later, another person came out and asked me if I was ok. She didn't introduce herself so I didn't know if she was a manager but she did apologize for the incident and said they were going to call an exterminator right away. I know this sounds snotty but I was really hoping they would have somehow compensated for the meal-perhaps a free dessert or drinks? When you go to a restaurant, you go not only for the food, but the experience...and this was not a good one.  Aside from the bug incident, not once did a waiter come to ask how our meals were, if we needed refills on anything and when we needed our check I needed to find someone who was not our waiter since he was MIA for a good part of the meal.  I'm ranting, I know but I had to do it....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=140,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.568,2.48
183,Jessica B.,"Winnetka, CA",6,23,,4.0,2012-10-30,"A group of friends and I went there last night, and overall we had a good experience. We got seated right away, drinks were brought to us quickly - with refills. The place was clean, and our waitress was nice enough. I shared their Triple Dipper platter with my boyfriend. It's an appetizer where you get to pick any three of the choices offered. We had the Southwestern egg rolls, Boneless Buffalo Wings, and Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers. The egg rolls were a bit spicy, but really flavorful; the wings were good; and the chicken crispers were ok. I didn't care for the honey-chipotle sauce, it was almost as if they didn't mix it enough because some bites would be only honey flavor, and other bites would be only chipotle flavor. Maybe the original would've tasted better. I asked for extra sides of ranch for the table, which we got, but one of them was blue cheese. Personally, I HATE blue cheese so it came as quite the unpleasant surprise when I dipped my egg roll into it and started chewing. Anybody could make that mistake since they both look alike, but still you don't pay to have your order be incorrect. We had a good time, and might go back there again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=160,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.8320000000000003,2.52

209,Danis H.,"San Gabriel, CA",4,6,,1.0,2013-02-16,"I would give this place a ""0"" star, but Yelp doesn't let me.  I'll just add to the list or horrible reviews for this ill-fated restaurant. I have never had a worse experience with customer service in any restaurant than at the Chili's at West Hills.  I went in on a wednesday night and ordered the $20 meal for 2.  Our server seemed somewhat friendly, but was very pushy about ordering drinks.  During our entire meal, only once did he, server ""Wood"", ever come by and offer to refill our drinks.  It was nearly 10pm by this time and there were almost no more customers.  I mean, who else could he be waiting on?  A table across from us left and there were only 2-3 tables now.  I noticed another server had picked up Wood's tip and brought it to the back.  When Wood came back, he was confused and thought the patrons had left without paying.  Puzzled and frantic, he went to speak with the other waiters to find out that another employee had already finalized their bill.  I never had a good vibe with Wood.  At the get go, there was something peculiar about his actions.  At the end of my meal, I paid him a fair tip for his more than lack luster service.  I felt that I was generous, but he obvious didn't.  I never ever check my receipts at the end of the day or week to find out if the posted tip on my credit card matches what I wrote for the waiter.  But something about our server Wood made me think differently.  The next night, I checked the posted amount and lo and behold, the TOTAL AMOUNT DUE was NOT THE SAME.  He changed my tip and deceitfully added an EXTRA $10 for himself.  I wasn't all that surprised because of his interactions with me and the other customers.  I just didn't trust him. Side:  I couldn't figure out why the server WOOD would dare to cheat someone and add a $10 TIP to a $20 meal?  Have some common sense.  Obviously, my total amount would be around $25, not $35.   I called the manager, Chris, and reported the problem.   He said he would call back.  Chris never called me back.  Strike 1.  I called and he told me that ""Well, he kinda put a ""1"" in front of your tip.  You can tell he changed it, and also changed your total amount.""   I asked: ""What are you going to do about it?"" Manager: ""Well, we can give you $10 credit or $10 coupon.  Which option would you like?"" Me: I was thinking are you serious.  Why would I ever want to come back to Chili's again.  Did you even have to give me an option.  I might as well give you my bank account number.  And seriously, just $10 credit for the all crap you put me through?!?  STRIKE 2. Me: ""I'll just take the $10 credit.""  Trying to hide my frustration.       ""What are you guys going to do with the server?"" Manager:  Oh, well, we.. uhm.. we have to look into it. Me (Thinking): Look into what! You already told me that your CROOK server changed my tip amount.  That is ILLEGAL.  It is a CRIME.  6 days later: I patiently waited for a credit back to my card.  However, I never received one.  I called Chili's and spoke with Chris and he informed me that he needed my credit card # to process the refund through accounting.  Well why didn't he tell me 6 days ago!!  I have to personal call just to get my money back.  This is ridiculous.   I asked for cash instead, and he responds, ""Well, I can't, I have to ask my general manager, and he doesn't come in until tomorrow.""  Then take the darn initiative to call him. He abruptly hangs up before I do.  They lack even simple customer service.  STRIKE 3!   I know these managers could care less about their jobs.  To them, it's EXACTLY that: JUST A JOB to make ends meet.  If they truly cared about their job, I wouldn't have to waste my time.  All the time spent typing this review and getting my money back won't be in VAIN if all of you Chili's patrons don't ever visit their restaurant AGAIN!   If you want to keep your money, then stay away.  If you feel like donating your hard earned money to despicable and conniving servers, then visit this Chili's at your discretion.  But you've been WARNED!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=200,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.372,2.56

Our appetizer came out missing the chicken but it was quickly corrected and 2 people apologized for it.   Having sam Adams Oktoberfest on tap is a plus by far too.  The food was pretty good. Everything came out hot and tasty. We ordered one rack of ribs with mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese and they split it for us nice and even so we could share.  We had just come in for a beer and appetizer but ended up getting more food cause everything was so good.   It was slow in there for a Friday night but I did not mind that at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=120,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.544,2.84

You have your choice of soups and salads to choose from and they give you a ginormous bowl of chips with salsa. You can get unlimited refills of the soup/salad. The bf took advantage of that. He was hungry. I ordered the chicken enchilada soup with a house salad. I've always loved the chicken enchilada soup. It was tasty and satisfying.  Yum yum.

This one is always packed, but it seems like it's never too bad with a big group, we only waited about 25 minutes, and we weren't squished into a little table. As packed as they were, they actually sent over 2 servers to help us, and take our orders. With 4 kids, you would think they would have had a problem, nope, not these guys. They brought the kids their food while the adults had our appetizers, and our salads. Service-5+ Their burgers, chicken crispers(usually, when they aren't soggy, yes sometimes they sit wherever they are, and the bottoms get a little soggy, try ordering the chipotle ones, you will never know)salads, chips and salsa, southwestern eggrolls, shrimp tacos, chicken fajitas, and of course their ribs, are all personal favorites of mine. Oh and the Chocolate Molten Cake, and Brownie Sundae for dessert. Food is always a 5+, unfortunately this time, because of the soggy crispers, which were still good, and the fact that we had to ask for extra dressing with every salad(they give you one little cup, and a HUGE plate of salad) I had to mark it down a little bit-4 The bar, try the MARGARITA, I suggest starting with that. Its a signature. The Patron or the Platinum Presidente are my 2 favorites, you can also try the trio as well. The bartenders can make almost anything, and they can make a Scooby Snack, unfortunately it just wasn't to her liking so because of that.

So I've decided to try it and went there for my lunch break. My waitress, Kasi, was very nice, sweet and professional. She got my order right away and brought it to my table as soon as it was ready. I wish more wait staff was like her. I've ordered lunch combo: Salad, Chicken Sandwich and fries. They didn't have Caesar salad in the lunch menu, but Kasi told me that I could still order it and it wouldn't be a problem.  The salad was good, fresh romaine lettuce, cheese, croutons and dressing, as soon as I finished that Kasi brought me the sandwich and fries.  I was really surprised to see only 10 (TEN) potato strips on my plate :) It was kind of funny though, 'cause you'd think if you're going to serve someone fries, you could at LEAST cut up and fry one whole potato :) Seriously, I've never seen smaller side order of fries :) It didn't bother me that much though. The sandwich was VERY good. The chicken was just off the grill, seared on the outside, juicy on the inside. I don't know what sauce did they use, but it went very well with grilled chicken. I loved it. The sandwich was A+, I will definitely come back for more. The only problem that I had with my order was WATER! It was UNFILTERED, tap water. I know it's free and I shouldn't expect much, but I shouldn't be drinking water with chlorine dioxide taste ... My best guess is that they haven't changed their water filter in a while, so I asked Kasi to bring me Iced Tea and take away that horrible water.

Our waitress was attentive and checked in a couple times, asked if we wanted to-go boxes and brought by the bill without us having to ask.  Today was a good day. There have been times though, when I've stopped in for dinner on a weekday and it's crowded and your order may get taken quick but wait times for food are long and we sometimes have to track the waitstaff down for the check at the end. Food? It's yummy, salty and calorie-laden and most people know that when they decide to go dine here. I love their burgers and Cajun chicken pasta. They also still do their dinner for 2 at $20; an appetizer to share and two entrees, a good deal if you're on a budget.

Long wait for the food.  Server not at all friendly nor engaging.  We ordered bottomless chips, fajitas, mini burgers, soups & steak with avocado.  Food was honestly not that great.  Steak I should say was tasty.  However, I was really expecting that their serving would be larger than what I've expected.  It's way smaller now & I don't feel the money was worth paying for the meals in those quantities.

Chad S. of Customer Service did his job and made things right and the bad is now all good once again!  Thank you Chad! Glad to see the customer service is much better and the AC issues got taken care of. Our waiter tonight was Anthony and he was excellent. We never really had much of any food issues here, the food is always good and the Triple Dipper is a great bargain and their new mashed potato skillet is awesome. This last year (2014) was a bit of a rough one for this location but things have improved greatly. So when Chad says he wants to make things right with customers that might have had a bad experience, he means it and takes care of it. I will be back to location with my family like we have many times in the past. Just very happy and pleased all the issues got fixed because I always loved this Chili's and didn't want to have to drive the extra miles to go to the Northridge location. Thanks again Chad S.

68,Brian S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,586,137.0,1.0,2015-05-01,"Question: how much is 99 cents worth? Answer: less than a dollar. Question: How much can 99 cents cost you? Answer (preface): Last night had a perfectly acceptable meal with perfectly acceptable service.  Booths were a tad uncomfortable (seats too far from the table for a normal sized person) and the light fixture was disgustingly dirty.  But other than that it was perfectly acceptable. Until it was time to pay the bill.  Waiter disappeared and no bill was delivered.  Instead he brought a mobile terminal and said, ""Oh... this was supposed to be at your table"".  No bill and we needed to go and this terminal was staring us in the face offering to settle the tab.  So we did.  So far so good. But the tip is defaulted to 20% which made me look like a cheap-skate in front of my date as I slid it to a more reasonable number.  Not just looked like one, she actually called me one.  Thanks Chili's... you made me look like a buffoon, and a cheap one at that. Then the bill shows up with a .99 charge for using the terminal. So here's the answer:  a 3-star review is now a 1-star review (minus 1 star for each issue cited above) and I'll never suggest going to Chili's again.

We appreciated that, because at some places, we had to track down our servers after they disappeared for a long time. The chips and salsa were so good! The cocktails were great, too. The Triple Dipper and Flatbread appetizers were delicious!  I have to say that the food here was tastier and had more flavor than at some of the fine dining establishments I've patroned.

55,Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148.0,3.0,2015-08-11,"Came here on a recommendation of the promise of a new menu and innovative tabletop kiosks that allow you to get your order faster. I've been to Chili's all over the country and know them to be in the Applebee's and TGI Fridays department. My expectations were low so there was room for improvement. We walk in the two front doors carrying a baby carrier and navigating our young child and see the host standing by the host stand patiently waiting for us. Realized that holding down the stand was more important than grabbing a door for us. Seated on the side, most tables were crowded. People like their Chili's. We got a nice big booth. They have some nice big HDTVs in the dining area so it's ideal to watch a game. We had grown-up drinks and they were fine. Meals were mediocre and I had no idea what to order. Probably should have gone with a sandwich or salad but the new smothered burritos looked good so I had one. My wife had the quesadilla salad without meat but apparently they don't take a dollar or two off the price even if you hold the protein. If I were in a part of the country without Mexican food, I'd welcome a burrito. But here, it was bland and I could find a better burrito a block or two away. Chili's is the national chain for when there are better options and you don't know the area. We live nearby and know of a several better options. The kiosk/tablet on the table is fine. They have games for kids ... or adults for $1 all you can play. Didn't do that. I used it to sign up for their rewards program. I also ordered another drink and dessert using it. Made it easier but kind of negated the server's job. She asked for a drink refill at one point but I had already told the bartender through the modern technology. Their Oreo topped molten cake, which is according to their menu and website only available for a limited time, is literally their molten cake with one Oreo cookie crushed over it. The photo looks so enticing. It was not desirable and we could be more satisfied going home and eating Oreos. Service was mediocre. I ordered twice from the machine and it felt like the server didn't come around much. I wanted water but never got the chance to order it. I don't want my Chili's. We won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=40,2.36,2.67,2.67,2.572,2.5460000000000003

My wife and I really enjoy Chili's fajitas. So we got dinner for two for twenty bucks. We each got the chicken fajitas. My granddaughter's each had a child's meal at no charge. All in all, dinner for 4 for twenty bucks. Now that's a great deal. Ambience: typical Chili's restaurant. The booths are large. The restaurant is clean. Lots of TVs throughout the restaurant. In addition, each table has an iPad type device that allows you to view the menu and pay your bill. But more importantly when you're there with young children, there are video games that are appropriate for fairly young children to play for a nominal fee ( unlimited games for $2). A big hit with my granddaughters. Service: the service tonight was exceptional. Our server, Jacqueline, was to our table within minutes of our seating. She brought our drinks promptly. The service was well-paced. In addition, we had a minor problem. The manager, Jen , came over and handled it in an extremely professional way leaving us very happy. Food: The 2 for $20 comes with an appetizer to share .  We chose  the  guacamole and chips .  A huge portion  of chips with a very generous portion of guacamole and an equally generous portion of salsa. Way more than anyone should eat as an appetizer.  And the guac was delicious. The fajitas consist of a fairly generous portion of grilled chicken, grilled green peppers, and side dish with guacamole, sour cream, cheese, salsa, and chopped tomatoes.

Food is pretty good, and the customer service is always amazing. To-go food is also very efficient, although very time consuming. They say the food will be ready in 15 minutes but really it's 30 minutes! The best thing about this restaurant is their chocolate molten lava cake. It's probably the best dessert known to man.

I usually get take out at every location because it's the safest and quickest way to go. I'm usually a TGI fridays person, but hadn't been to chili's in a few years. Doordash to the rescue.  So...game 5 of the NBA finals, wanted food but wanted to be in my living room. I went with the triple dipper appetizer and 1/2 rack of craft beer ribs. A lot has changed on the menu (WHY did they get rid of the chicken with the bacon, cheese, and green onions?! It was amazing), but the ribs were great. I chose corn and loaded mashed potatoes and as usual, no disappointments there. As for the triple dipper, I chose big mouth bites, boneless honey-chipotle wings, and crispy cheddar bites. The first two were good, with the boneless wings being the best and I wish i would have just gotten those and the sliders. The crispy cheddar bites are disgusting and not crispy. Nor were they hot.

It took another 10 minutes for the server to return so that we could have some fresh food brought out. She took our fries and never returned. I had to get up and request a manager to come speak with us. Insert Andrew the rude manager! He approached the table with an attitude and spoke to us with such a condescending tone, and asked if wanted to box our food up that was cold and not very good. Why would we want to take anything home? Andrew was extremely rude and borderline disrespectful telling us ""we could just get up and go now"" and blaming the horrible service on the holidays (the restaurant wasn't very busy at all).

Her first bite was was an exercise in pain as they forgot and put it on anyway. It took a while to flag down our waiter and she asked that they fix her food. I was almost done eating at this point. It took quite a while to get the re-done chicken so I had long since finished my dinner and got to sit and watch her eat hers.

I went there the other day and it was marvelous. Bad selection of beers, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=40,2.32,2.59,2.59,2.504,2.482
48,Tani A.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2.0,5.0,2017-09-10,So happy I live next to a Chilis!  We always get great service every time we come. Even when I wanted something that wasn't on the menu one time the waitress asked in the back and I was serviced the Monterey Chicken since the cook knew how to make it. And I love that the molten chocolate cake comes in a smaller less comatose serving for when my husband doesn't want any.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=40,2.48,2.61,2.61,2.868,2.558

37,Sally A.,"West Hills, West Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-27,"I don't often write reviews but after just having a terrible experience I thought I should - as a warning to all patrons. Our main server (gabby) was wonderful but even her pleasant demeanor did not make up for the food. I ordered the low calorie chicken dish (which tasted like rubber and was inedible). My son had the crispers (batter soggy). I ordered a cup of chili as I couldn't eat my dinner and that had a sour aftertaste so I couldn't eat that either.  Gabby graciously took my dinner off the bill....and all was good ....but then along came Mark who prompted this review. We paid at the table kiosk and filled in the online review and marked things less than satisfactory. He said ""oh no you can't give us that review - it impacts us"" and promptly took the console and changed my review! I took it back, and told him his logic was backward and changed the scores back again. In my field of work, I've worked with many restaurants/restaurant chains and can spot when there is a need to implement drastic change .....hoping corporate pay attention and implement change as a result of these kind of reviews before it's too late......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills,2.44,2.64,2.64,,2.56
26,Raquel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,82,73.0,5.0,2017-09-27,Not sure why this location has such a bad rep. It has a huge parking lot that you can pick and choose to your liking. That is a huge perk in LA. As soon as you walk in the host greets you with a huge smile. That is a huge plus for me.  The waiter came right away and took our appetizer order and drinks. Hubby and I ordered the smothered fries. Sad to say we practically licked the plate lol. They were so good!  For our entrees we ordered the blackened salmon and the shrimp fajitas. Food was hot and delicious just as we would expect from this franchise. For dessert we had the salted caramel molten cake. It was to die for! We did not even have to wait for the waiter to ask us because we ordered it right at the table. Love that! The waiter was really nice and kept giving us refills for our drinks. It was great. Had no complaints therefore they get a five star review that simple! :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills,2.6,2.64,2.64,,2.624
19,Mark R.,"West Hills, CA",0,11,2.0,1.0,2017-09-29,"Went there on a Monday evening around 7. The place was pretty empty, except for the bar area. Took a while for the hostess to show up and seat us. Took another 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were there. There were only 4 tables with patrons, but no servers to be found. We had actually thought about getting up and leaving, when a server finally showed up. He indicated that he had very needy customers and that was why it took him so long. The server was pleasant and the food was okay. But, service took a long time and refills were scarce. Don't know what has happened to this location, but probably explains why it was so empty.

15,Loves Food D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,52,,1.0,2017-10-05,"I remember years ago Chilis was the place to go when i wanted to have a special mother/daughter bonding time prior to us going wheat and gluten free. Last night we decided to go with the whole family and it was nothing like I remembered. We asked the server if they have gluten free menu and he gave us this list of which dish has no wheat in it, very slim picking. So we ordered GRILLED chicken for our son, steak for our daughter, salad for me and fajitas for hubby. The kids food came first which was great except they gave my son this deep fried chicken with tons of batter on it. Told the server (AGAIN) we have wheat allergies and we ordered grilled. He took it back and we had to wait another 10 mins. My salad came along with the grilled chicken which is so microscopic that my son asked for dinner after he ate his dinner! Mind you my son is a light eater and it didnt even fill him up. Once everyone was done with their meal, hubby's fajita finally came with FLOUR tortillas. No regards to allergy at all here. His $17 fajitas also had tiny portions. He was only able to eat half of it as we were all still starving so we were picking at his plate. All in all it was a true disappointment to come here and waste all that money for HORRENDOUS service, baby portions and zero regards to people's allergies. The whole family agreed that we will NOT be coming back....sad!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-west-hills?start=20,2.44,2.62,2.62,,2.548

54,Terry K.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,2017-11-06,"Was there for lunch on a Sunday. Our drinks were awful. The blended margarita, served in a tall tumbler, didn't taste freshly-blended. My spouse's coconut-pineapple drink was so sweet that we couldn't even drink it. The chips were good. The salsa was good even though it looked and tasted like it had come from a jar. The guacamole didn't look or taste freshly-made. The burger and fries were very good. The fajitas were delicious, although the beef was quite tough. We received the wrong fajitas initially. They were removed before we touched them to be given to another party. The burger sat on the table for several minutes while waiting for the correct fajita order to arrive. It came with flour tortillas instead of the corn we had ordered. The server was friendly and we were bid hello and goodbye at the door, but we probably won't be going back any time soon.

Where do I begin.   Ordered a selection of appies including the onion rings, fried pickles and buffalo chicken strips. All were sent back for being over cooked and almost burnt. The replacement were mostly an insult. The chicken strips came back uncooked and drowning in sauce.  I guess they are pre-cooked are sitting by waiting for an order and only then dropped into the frier....resulting in dry and rock hard chunks of chard chicken. The onion rings came back still dry to the core but at least we're not dark coffee brown as in the first go around The pickles better but MOSTLY BATTER PIECES leaving you to dig for the actual pickles in the oily mess. Come to main dish items was not much better.    Service was a little better than the food....but only slightly.

My dad was in the restroom and my mom did state we wanted to wait for him but still the waiter just stood there to ask us for our order.  After taking our order he just stood there because we only order 3 huge plates (we were a party of 5) and made it seem like it was weird to share food.  When our food arrived, I forgot to ask for ranch. I waited for the waiter to come back and ask ""if everything is alright""...the waiter never came!

The bar is usually a happening spot, and of course the dining area side will depend on times and days. Of course it's a casual place with a similar look and feel to other locations....so there's that.  I've had good service the times I've been with a nice greet at the door, and nice servers/bartenders. To help with service they use the tabletop ordering tablets for ordering, paying bills, and more. So that helps with somethings.  Lots of parking around available in the lot.  ---FOOD & PRICES--- I've been coming for some years every now and then, and I can't really say I've had bad times or bad food.  I'm a sucker for the Triple Dipper. Three appetizers featured with some dipping sauces.  Somethings I like: Boneless wings and bone in wings Southwestern eggrolls - crispy flour tortillas filled with chicken, black beans, corn, cheese, red pepper, and spinach.  Nachos - These are individual pieces of tortillas with the ingredients on each one (chicken, cheeese, beans, jalapenos, queso) Texas cheese fries - How can you not like cheese fries?!
