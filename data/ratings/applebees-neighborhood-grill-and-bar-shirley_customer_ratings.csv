37,Erik D.,"Medford, NY",229,131,20.0,3.0,2015-09-02,"Okay, well... I had a good experience and a bad one... I'll dish the veggies first. I'd say a month and a half ago... I went here with a bunch of friends i'd say around 8pm-ish? It was a bunch of us, 7 guys total. When we first got seated, they placed us in a tight booth, practically sitting on top of one another and also behind us was a really sweet family with young kids. Knowing how rowdy our conversations could get, plus the size of the table, we asked kindly to be seated at a bigger booth.  So at first it seemed like the waiter was rather bothered by it, but we didn't think anything of it. After a few moments, same waiter came over and asked what we all wanted to drink. A few of us got beer. Others got regular soft drinks and few waters. The waiter doesn't return for approx 35 some odd mins. At this point we are all ready to order apps and even our dinner. When the waiter did return, he dropped off our drinks and then left again, we all watch as he walks over to his Co-Workers just to chat. He finally decides to return and take our order after chatting it up for 15mins. We place orders and 30mins later it comes out. Night goes on... Place starts filling up now due to the 1/2 off App'fanatics.... We basically can't find our waiter for the check. Completely like MIA... wasn't taking orders, wasn't serving food in the section, nothing... It was bazaar. Finally after another 20mins we were able to pay. As I go to leave, I notice my keys are missing. So I look around the table, on the seats, on the floor... Can't seem to find them. So I assumed that maybe I had lost them when we moved seating.. so I walk over to our old bench and had asked if anyone has seen my keys. They all said ""no the seats were cleaned before we got here"". So now I go up to the hostess desk and ask the girls if they have seen a set of keys or perhaps had someone turn a set in.. They all replied ""no"" Nobody continued to help, nobody really cared. Yeah its my fault I lost my keys, but I figured someone would of at least help spread the word for me or something. Being 5 of us came in one vehicle.. we couldn't leave.. I keep searching for our waiter.. finally he came into sight and I asked him and he ended up saying ""yeah, its in the hostess desk""... Soooo for 30mins of not knowing where my keys are they were at the hostess desk where I asked if they were there before...  You would think when we got moved and our waiter found a set of keys, he would of asked if it was any of ours. I guess that's what really urked me about this particular Applebees. However on the flip side... perhaps 2 weeks ago I went once and the waitress was wonderful! she was really sweet and she interacted with us. Right off the bat she asked what we wanted to drink. She threw our drink orders in, and then came back asking if we knew what we wanted, She even gave a whole recommendation on the new items that were on the menu. We had a great time chatting with her. Our drinks were always full, she came back to check on us a few times. Once she saw the napkins on the plates and such, she asked how everything was, and asked if we were ready for desert or if we wanted the check. That's quality service. Also keep in mind, this was again prime time dinner time so around 6:30pm. She was just able to hustle and keep customers happy. Employees like that is what makes experiences at a restaurant, fun and enjoyable I guess this place is just a 50/50 shot when it comes to service. So 3 Stars for now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shirley,1.5800000000000003,1.5800000000000003,1.5800000000000003,1.5800000000000003,1.5800000000000003
