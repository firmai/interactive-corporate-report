33,Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",177,394,49.0,2.0,2013-08-22,"Came here and was a little underwhelmed with the service. The only server who seemed to be on his game was a younger male bartender. We walked in at an odd time (I think it was around 4) and there were only about 7 or 8 tables full. One group walked in ahead of us, and needless to say the hostess panicked and was obviously overmatched. After waiting for a couple minutes twiddling our thumbs, we ended up just moving to the bar. It took forever to get our drink order and food order taken, but I won't hold it against this guy b/c he was the only one behind the bar and  about 60% of the patrons were there...so not only was he personally serving half of the restaurant, but he was making drinks for all the rest of them. Maybe he should give a few pointers to the chick who was overwhelmed by walking 2 sets of people to their seats. The middle-aged female bartender who came and started helping him later was rude. I was staring at a pile of to-go containers on the other side of the bar directly across from me. When I asked her for a container and motioned to them (she could have grabbed them with one hand, and without moving handed them to me...for a sum total of 3 seconds worth of work) she acted annoyed and told me ""hold on one minute,"" then proceeded to walk around and look busy doing a whole lot of nothing for the next 5 minutes before she just completely forgot. Needless to say, the dude who had made about 35 drinks in that time period ended up grabbing us the containers and our check. The food tasted just like TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2?start=40,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864

We were seated at a table that is right next to the kitchen/bathroom/server station. The waiter training the trainee was kind of rude and forgot my drink and didnt bother coming back until our appatizers arrived. The worst oart about him not coming back to check on us was he was sitting at a table 20 feet from us just staring into space. When the entrees came out my girlfriends sandwich was missing its onion straws and it had tomatos on it even though she asked for no tomatos. after dinner i wanted to order one of their drink specials (a mojito) but they did not have any mint.

The average appetizer is $10, burger $13 and entree is $15. We arrived early on Saturday night, about 4:00pm. Most of the restaurant was empty and yet the hostess who was clearly confused went back and fourth with another employee as to where to seat us for about 2 minutes. We should've turned around there and left but we stuck it out and got seated. Our waiter who was nice, was also easily confused by us ordering their non-alcoholic slush drinks. When my fiance ordered he replied with ""those aren't free refills"". The menu states the slushes do have free refills. And we had to point that out to him. We ordered an appetizer, she got chicken fingers and I got a burger. The food was as expected and enjoyable. But sitting through my whole meal without a refill on my or her drink is quite ridiculous. For that reason alone, I won't be back. And now that we gave it a shot while we were in the area, and saw the escalated prices and poor service, we'll be taking our future business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2?start=60,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

We walked in and were greeted promptly and were seated immediately due to the time of day.  The restaurant was empty to the exception of a few tables. The greeter gave us menu's and told us the server would be right over.   I remember it was around 2:15 PM because my friend asked me what tie it was when we were seated.  We chose what we were wanting to eat and sat waiting for the server.  And waited.  And waited.   Time is now 2:25PM  Viewed a man looking around like he was searching for his server.  Flagged down greeter who sat us and asked her to find a server since we had been waiting. She said she would. During the entire time we were waiting we heard copious amounts of laughter and roughhousing in the kitchen area.  Time is now 2:30PM and we stood up and walked out the door.  SUMMERY : fifteen minutes of waiting for our server in a close to empty restaurant while listening to what seemed like a crazy gossip session going on in the kitchen area and watching another customer searching in vain for his server did not leave the favorable impression that Friday's wants in a Yelp review.

Our server was difficult to flag down and service, especially to start, was very slow, but she was good about replacing our waters and refilling our appetizers.  We ordered:  1. Potstickers: The sauce is sweet and interesting (definitely not Szechuan), but the potstickers themselves are bland with strange textures that definitely don't belong in a potsticker.  2. Loaded potato skins: I love these, but even I have to admit that we seemed to be getting a bad batch here. Excessively oily, and one of our potato skins had a huge black portion at the bottom (had it gone bad? I honestly don't know).  3. Boneless buffalo wings: these were particularly bad, even for T. G.

THIS PLACE WAS AWFUL.  One of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant.  We sat for quite a while before anyone came over.  It was a quiet Sunday afternoon.  Drink order was not too much issue.  F We waited a loooooooong time for the food.  When it came, it was clear that the burger had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time.  The rock was literally solid.  The burger which had been ordered MR, was a hockey puck.  My wife's chicken salad was the same.  The chicken was rubber from being under the lamp and the lettuce was hot. The kids meals had about 6 fries on the plate.  It was amazing that any server would even think to put those things in front of a customer. We are not complainers - but this was ridiculous.  We sent both back - and the replacements were not too much better - but we just wanted to eat and get out.  The manager came over and apologized - but seemed like he had said the same words 1,000 times.  It was like he was going through the motions - it was clear that he didn't want to be there. Then I respond to the standard survey on the receipt - assuming I'd at least get an email from TGIF recognizing that they heard me.  Nothing.  If you're going to ask to hear from a customer - at least acknowledge what's communicated!

I felt like I was surrounded by zombies. It made me feel sad, and I wasn't sad.  2. We sat at the bar. When we finally attracted the attention of one of the two bartenders working the service bar it felt as if we were putting her out.  3. The floors were dirty...and there was no one there. If you can't be spotless when there is no one there, when can you be clean? 4. The food was, in my husband's words - ""not the worst I've ever had, it's edible"". Normally his standards are higher than mine. Not this time. I thought it was bad and it took way longer than it should have. We both split the pretzel appetizer. Incredibly buttery. I didn't finish mine and I ALWAYS finish pretzels. I'd eat pretzels until I pop. We also both got the Jack Daniel's burger. First the BBQ sauce was runny with chunks of something or other in it. The burger was unseasoned and at the same time had an odd taste. The bacon was rubbery. The bun stuck to my teeth. I finished less than half. Clearly it was not fresh. The sweet potato fries were the only bright spot. They were yummy.  I will not be back. This is one time where I actually agree with the ratings from fellow Lehigh Valley yelpers.

TGIF used to be  our favorite restaurant, but we will never visit the Allentown location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002
61,Teresa G.,"Emmaus, PA",32,1,,1.0,2017-09-04,Service was terrible and the food was less than mediocre. Used to be a decent place but their standards have gone down hill,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002
69,Ed F.,"Creedmoor, NC",0,7,,4.0,2017-09-19,"I do confess, I've never been a big fan of TGI Fridays. I've eaten in a few different locations around the country and wasn't very impressed. This one is near the hotel we stay in when in Allentown and has been consistently good. Staff turnover must be a major issue, but the service has always been acceptable. The beer is good and cold. The food has never been anything less than excellent. While I generally avoid this chain out in the world, I will return to this location as they have never let me down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
60,Ty B.,"Philadelphia, PA",13,1,,1.0,2017-10-14,"Me and da boyz went to TGIF to get ready for Saturday's events. Because Saturday's are for THE BOYZ. Food was undercooked, staff wasn't ""peppy"" enough to our standards, we hold a high standard FYI. AND THE DRINKS....  Weak. Even the beer was like they poured half out and filled it with water to top it off. But kuddos to Samantha. She was cool and very cute ;p But everyone else.. no.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
55,Y B.,"Allentown, PA",0,40,25.0,5.0,2017-10-27,"I was impressed with both the customer service and food. From entry into restaurant we were greeted by at least 3 employees. We sat and had a very friendly and helpful waitress. The food was very good and filling. And the manager of the restaurant even came to our table to see if everything is ok. Very pleased with this restaurant, will definitely go back. Good job tgif!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

70,Ethan H.,"Allentown, PA",0,19,,2.0,2017-11-06,"This place has changed over the years, unfortunatley not in a good way.  The dining area and restrooms were clean, and our server was very nice.  However we went in because my wife wanted ribs, and we've had them there before and they are excellent.  They have new ribs theyve been advertising on tv for only 12.99 for a full rack.  We ordered 3 full racks and waited 45 minutes which was odd because it was not busy at all on a tuesday night.  The new ribs were awful, no flavor even when drenched in sauce.  We told our waitress and asked if we can order the old ribs from the menu and she apologized and said all the ribs were that new version now and half her customers since the switch have hated them.  I hope that alarming ratio makes it to the corporate purchasers before its too late.  Won't order that again unless they switch back.  The old ribs were fantastic thats why we went in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
65,Ce C.,"Allentown, PA",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-15,"This place is ridiculous. If they aren't messing up orders they are not putting orders in their system at all. I placed an order today, spoke to the same voice I've placed orders with in the past only to be told when I go to pick up my to go order that they never received said order. I was asked if I'm sure I called the right Fridays as if there were more than one Fridays in Allentown. Horrible service, horrible staff. The only thing good at this place is the food, when the order is correct,  that is. Save yourself a headache and go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
56,Michael A.,"Allentown, PA",0,4,,1.0,2017-12-24,We were there last night at 6 pm.  The two or three greeters should not speak down to customers.  And why do the greeters seem confused about the table rotation. Not that hard people.  Food mediocre service very good.  The waitress came over enough times and the food took twenty min to come out. Why were we seated in the dark dungeon when the restaurant was empty? Go to Wendy's or Wawa better food and service. We left and the three greeters never noticed while talking among themselves.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
58,Dory S.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",28,57,8.0,3.0,2018-01-11,"Originally I was only going to give 1 star. We ordered a nacho appetizer. It was terrible. There were a couple of beans thrown on it. The cheese was like they took white American sliced cheese and stuck it in a microwave. That was bad enough, but we didn't see the waitress again until after we finished the nachos (we finished them because we were starving). When she finally returned she asked if we were ready to put our order in for our meal. At this point we said just bring the check. The manager came over and asked how everything was. We told him everything that happend and he made it right by comping our meal if we would stay. (We did get charged for the nachos) but that was a fair deal. I ordered the bean and avacado burger.  I have to say it was very good. A bit stingy on the avacado.    I probably would not return only because in general it wasn't the best experience, but I commend the manager. He handled the situation correctly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
