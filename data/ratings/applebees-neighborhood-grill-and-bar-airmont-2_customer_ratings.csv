28,Jen M.,"Suffern, NY",1,26,,1.0,2013-05-20,"I used to dine at this Applebee's fairly often and always had good service until this past year. I have been noticing a slow decline over the past year and now it has hit rock bottom. I can't complain about the food because it is just chain food and the same at all of them unless they go out of their way to mess it up. Ok so we went there around 7 pm, was not busy at all. We had to wait for about 5 minutes for the host to even come seat us, and he had a horrible attitude. After we were seated our waitress walked by our table at least 10 times, and didn't take our drink order for 15 minutes (drinks didn't arrive for another 10 minutes). We normally would have just left at this point but had had a long day and just wanted something to eat. I ordered the Chicken fajita roll up with no Pico De Gallo. When she finally brought our food what seemed like a lifetime later, she had chicken fajitas (totally different meal). I told her that that was wrong and she just looked at me with a blank stare and told me that that is what I ordered until another server stopped and helped us and told her to take it back. It came back about 20 minutes later but with the pico on it. By this time the table sitting behind us had asked for the check and the table behind them was complaining because she brought out the entrées, but they had ordered soups and salads and apps and the server did not understand why they wanted her to take the entrées until after they were given the app, she actually stated ""Ohh so you don't just want to have them now or after?"" I asked to just have my meal prepared to go because I was not going to make my partner wait for yet a third attempt to get what I actually ordered. She finally brought me my to go food. At this point the table behind us with small children had been asking for the check for over 45 minutes. It was a joke in our whole section because she had messed up everyone's meal. The couple behind us asked to see the manager. He came over about 10 minutes later threw his hands in the air and yelled, ""Well what do you want me to do about it!"" I believe the couple was just in shock and said they just wanted the check, he stormed away and came back and literally threw it on their table. That was not a pleasant experience and I did not go back for a very long time. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to get the car side to go. I called and ordered and the girl just hung up after I said the last item. I called back to give them my info for my car and a different person answered the phone. He said ""Oh..you want her to actually bring it out?"" I replied yes and asked if they were still doing that, he says, ""Yea I guess."" So I get there and park in the car side area. I waited for about 20 minutes. I didn't want to go in because I have a broken foot and didn't want to walk up the curb, hence why I was doing car side. Finally she came out and handed me the check with out even a hello (There goes your tip right there). She went in and came back out with my cold food, gave me my credit card rolled her eyes and shook her head on the way. That will be the last time myself, family and even friends who I told will ever be going to that establishment. Very sad because it used to be good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-airmont-2?start=20,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
26,Elizabeth B.,"Nyack, NY",3,2,,4.0,2013-12-07,"Did lunch here on a Wednesday. Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. My friend ordered the Napa chicken- wasn't very impressed with it. I ordered the grilled chicken caesar salad and it was good. The server recommended the dessert 'bites' which we tried- strawberry cheesecake and brownie bites and both were very good and exactly the right portion for wanting something sweet but without being overly indulgent.

I've had waaay too many bad experiences at Applebees so generally I avoid it like the plague. However, when he mentioned it was half-off appetizers after 10pm, I had a change of heart aka I went into ""ballin' on a budget"" mode.  I've got to say, even if our bill wasn't 50% off, this place would still be pretty good. Portions were huge and the food tasted fresh. And best of all really good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-airmont-2,,,,,
22,Sandra D.,"Suffern, NY",0,3,,2.0,2015-02-01,Friendly staff but the quality has done down at this location.  We've been going to this Applebee's for a long time and now it seems to have a weird odor - like a kitchen smell when you walk in.  not very appealing especially if you get seated near the kitchen. Too many menus were given to us too - and 1 of them wasn't even valid as it was the mon-fri lunch options apparently.  Not worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-airmont-2?start=20,,,,,

17,Robert M.,"Ramsey, NJ",3,6,,1.0,2015-07-19,"Not only did everyone seem to hate being there but no one wanted to even talk. We were ""greeted"" by the greeter and she didn't even say hello. She actually looked scared. Then we got to our table, waited 10 minutes to have a woman come over and go ""are you getting a drink"". No hello no introducing herself just a rude what-do-you-want attitude. After we got our drinks she then left with out asking if we were ready to order and we were. When. She finally appeared we had to call her over to tell her we were ready. It took 30 min just to get our appetizers and then another 20 minutes to get our food!!!! The worst part was they were not even busy! Our waitress was so rude and curt that when I asked why is it taking so long she actually snapped at me and said ""you wanna see the ticket of when you ordered? Ya that's what I thought"" and walked away. DO NOT EAT AT THIS APPLEBEE'S!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-airmont-2,,,,,

I was surprised that the place wasn't packed! The game was on last night. Anyway, I tried something new: the Chicken Fajita Rollup and while it did taste delicious, I didn't taste any chicken!! But I didn't let the waitress know because I didn't want to be such a burden nor get charged extra haha. Overall, I guess I can say I had a nice time.

The appetizers arrived before the drink from the bar, (which were incorrect), part of the order never arrived, and the pricing was inconsistent with what was on the menu. There was a parade in the town the evening we went, but it was widely publicized and if the restaurant was worried about being busy, they shod have put extra staff on.

I was flabbergasted, who talks to a customer like that? So since these people have my food, I didn't say anything in fear that they would do something to it.

I haven't the faintest idea why I chose to dine here and am frankly embarrassed that I did so. The place was mostly deserted, and, as we found, with good reason. The boneless wings were more breading than chicken, slathered in a sloppy (in all senses of the word) sauce, and absurdly salty. The steak was overcooked despite my clearly having stated it be cooked rare. The broccoli had a slightly metallic aftertaste. Even my mother's drink was watery. I am giving two stars out of politeness, but I suppose I should be polite to myself first and foremost and go back to steering clear of places like this.
