Laura O.,"Anchorage, AK",215,6,37,4.0,8/19/2017,"We went for birthday lunches and were not sure what to expect after reading reviews of this and other locations.  The food was good, just what we expected from other Red Robin locations. I had a gluten free bun for mine which is drier than regular bread. It costs a little more, but is easier to eat than with a lettuce wrap. Our server, Chelsea, was attentive and checked on us at regular intervals. The manager, Angel, came through as well to check on things. He saw my boys had demolished the fries and personally went to get refills for them.  Overall, we had a good experience with little wait time to be seated for a late lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada
Jennie H.,"Northeast, Denver, CO",17,3,2,2.0,12/30/2017,"The food was great, the service however was unacceptable. I went here with my boyfriend for a date and we had to ask for silverware, which they brought. We also has to ask for napkins which didn't come the entire meal so we had to wipe our hands on our pants or lick our fingers off. Then while we were seat the tables next to us left and while the busser got the plates and drinks off, he didn't clean the table off at all before the next group was brought to the table. I was just disappointed in the service overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada
Richard F.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",3,56,7,4.0,8/18/2017,Once again I have to say that this national chain is quite good! The burgers are delicious and come with fries or you can get a salad instead. I took two grandkids and the kids meals look decent and for a little more you can get an unlimited root beer float. The tavern burger is just $6.99 so not bad at all! The service was good though I can see where the place can get quite crowded. These places deserve recognition and just because they are national does not mean they are crummy. Inside is attractive though it can get noisy.  Just pick a good time and you'll be fine. The menu is large so much to choose from. I see no reason to bypass this place whatsoever! The food is good and it worth stopping in for a meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada

Chris W.,"Arvada, CO",3,49,14,5.0,10/3/2017,"I've loved Red Robin since the late 80's and they've stayed consistently great over the decades to remain a favorite spot for my kids, family, and friends. While their burgers are among the best anywhere, it's the endless friend (with ranch!) that really keep us coming back. Glad they haven't spoiled this feature and realize it's a valuable signature feature. Most locations also have very friendly and efficient wait staff (though I've had a few stinkers over the years, to be sure). In short: for kids (with their own huge menu) and adults alike, Red Robin never disappoints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada

Sarah D.,"Arvada, CO",0,73,2,1.0,12/20/2017,"We used to come to this Red Robin all the time when I was younger.  It was fun, clean, the food was good...it was the place to go for weekend family dinners and seemed like everyone in town went there.  Went here for the first time in a few years last week and was really disappointed.  We got there at 4:45 on a Saturday and were told there was a 30 minute wait for 3 people.  When we were finally seated, there were tons of empty tables.  It seemed like the wait was due to short staffing, which shouldn't happen at dinner on a Saturday night.  My menu had food all over its pages and the floor in the area we were seated in was absolutely disgusting.  It looked like they hadn't swept in days.  We ordered a single order of mozz sticks, which the people we were with had done just a few months ago, but where told they don't do that anymore, you have to get a double order...seems like they could have easily made the single order and priced it anyway but just wouldn't take the time or effort to do so.  The food was fine, nothing outstanding and nowhere near as good as I remember it.  Luckily the service was pretty good.  I just feel like this restaurant has gone down the drain.  It used to be really really good and fun but I left this time feeling sad and kind of gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada

This place was really busy but there was only one waiter for the whole dining area so service was really slow. I ordered the Bonzai Burger which came with a grilled pineapple and a tangy sauce.

Tobie T.,"Denver, CO",0,26,,1.0,12/18/2017,"Everything was going good in the beginning. We had a large group, and they seated all of us in a timely matter, which was great. Our server Rosie was nice, but we waited for our beers for about 20 minutes which was a little frustrating, but we were patient because they were busy. Food was good, other than my hamburger was a little pink and I asked for Super well done. I go to pay, and she comes around to get which items were on my ticket. I told her which ones, there were about 5 orders, I asked if my discount was applied, and made sure she got them entered correctly, which she says yup I have it all here. Then my balance comes up which is all she showed me on the screen, I pay, she added in her gratuity tip, and she tells me please take this survey for me, which I did. And we were done. I had my receipt emailed to me, and after looking it over that night at home, I was charged for things I didn't order. Kinda upset me because I repeated to her my items and she said yes I got it. I should have looked it over myself before paying, but she was so quick to get her survey, and check us out, I assumed everything was correct since she said it was 2 times. I ended up paying almost $20.00 more than what I ordered. Either someone in my group had a less amount due, or she pocketed it. Not very happy, I work in the Marketplace and eat here a lot for lunch, but I think I'm good here for a while....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada
Sandy N.,"Arvada, CO",32,43,13,5.0,3/15/2017,"I love going to Red Robin at this location because the servers have always been nice and attentive. We always get our food fresh and hot. My parents always order the Banzai (I think that's what it's called) and I always order a regular cheeseburger. We have noticed that as soon as we get our food, we have to place an order of more fries because they give us no more than 10 the first time, but that way we get a second round of super hot fries. One time only we did get our burgers very cold (this might have been a couple years ago), but the manager at that time fixed it quickly, and we honestly haven't had any bad experiences here.   BTW, they have a Brazilian server, I totally forgot his name, but he's such a sweetheart... and very handsome, by the way! He's been awesome the couple times we got him.

She is a larger girl with excessive makeup. She was sitting on her butt when we walked in. She could have taken her trash it at any point.  We asked another hostess to move tables, I was holding a sleeping baby and they put us in chairs. We asked to move to a booth so I could lay him down, she said, ""no im sitting someone here.""

Lance L.,"Arvada, CO",115,105,468,1.0,11/12/2016,"Sorry folks.  Downgrade on this place. Seriously NOT told about added charges and extras, even when I asked. First off my order was wrong. This is not the Whisky River (onion straws? Could I have a pickle?). I asked to have a few dipping sauces. ""Is there a charge I asked""? ""No"" was the waiters response. So I ordered some garlic aioli and a smidge of cheese sauce to dip my fries in. Note the picture of the amount of cheese sauce. $1.19. Garlic Aioli .75 cents. Played the Ziosk game at the table. This one I assumed was free like at Chili's. It's not. $1.99 entertainment fee? Could you please put up a little notification sign?   Free Birthday burger, which was nice, but when I asked the waiter about the charges he was like ""sorry"". People, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is coming to the same location soon. They are truly awesome and you can have all the condiments you wish for free AND a free birthday burger.

I know I'm sounding like a fat kid, but come on.  They were also described as coming with a dipping sauce, which they didn't.  We couldn't find our server most of the time, and even when she was in our area she seemed to circle around all of her other tables and ignore ours.  Our entrees also took way too long to come out for a salad and a wrap.

My husband made the smart choice and went for a traditional burger. That's what you do in a place like red robin. You don't do what I did which was try to upscale a red robin burger.  My choice was a burger on ciabatta topped with garlic aioli, roasted tomatoes and arugula tossed in olive oil. The olive oil was dumped on the arugula so much that I had a layer of oil on the bottom of my basket. Everything was soaked in oil. I literally could not eat it.  Our waitress was great and brought me a new bun, making sure I was happy. She was awesome.

Hain-Lee H.,"Mountain View, CA",72,93,156,1.0,5/11/2016,"Like others have mentioned here, the service is pretty disappointing.  1. They refuse to cut the burgers in half for you, and the wait staff say it's because the cooks don't want to. Uh, what? It sounds entitled but every other burger place gladly accommodate this request.  2. Drinks took 30+ minutes. Our party had people get the bottomless strawberry lemonade as well as root beer floats. They took forever to come. Servers seldom came by to refill so we had to be on high alert every time one was near. And my friend at first was told (after like 20 min) that the root beer float machine was broken or something and asked if he was ok with just a root beer. He said no just cancel it then, and then the waitress said ""Okay, let me try the other machine and see if that works."" Why didn't she do that in the first place? 3. Burgers also took forever after the drinks 4. When we paid, we opted to all lay separately using the tablet since it lets you split the check however many ways you want. A convenient option, except the waitress kept coming back and hovering over whoever was currently paying, which is awkward because she could totally see what you were tipping. And frankly we didn't want her to see because we were not happy with the service. So we just ended up always waiting for her to walk away before tipping. Basically, when we wanted refills on drinks or fries she is nowhere to be seen. And while we are paying she is back every minute.  Sorry Red Robin.

Teresa T.,"Denver, CO",6,23,44,4.0,9/6/2015,"We came for my birthday lunch and I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered a Merry Moscato Punch, French Onion Soup with A1 Peppercorn burger.  My son ordered the Banzai burger and the Bottomless Root Beer Float.  The drink was delicious, the soup was delicious the burger was okay.  It was dry, but it's always dry when I ask them to cook the meat.  I always ask for extra sauce on the side. The onion bun was hard.  My son's sesame seed bun was soft.  Fries were hot and that's always a plus.  The waitress was nice, but not the most attentive.  We had to ask for refills.  She'd walk up and ask if everything was tasting good and we'd reply yes and she'd run away before we could ask for refills. I actually interrupted her when she ran away from us to talk to the table they just sat 2 tables away.  We came at 11am right when they opened so it was basically empty and really no excuse for not having refills done promptly.   I'll go back again, probably not often though.  My son loves burgers, but we can find burgers closer to our home.  That's just my experience with one waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=20

Pamela G.,"Boulder, CO",141,33,8,1.0,8/19/2016,"Never again people NEVER AGAIN! Now before you jump to conclusions about how I am an impossible to please, one star giving monster, feel free to check my record. This is the first one star Yelp review I have ever given. I love giving out 5 star ratings but this place deserves to be my first one star review! So my BFF and I decide we are going to go out for a girls night on the cheap and decide Red Robin was a great idea for apps and drinks ( I personally have not been to one in over 3 years but my experiences always have been good before last night). We order the onion rings (which were fine) pretzel bites( the beer cheese sauce was probably a 3 out of 10 but still edible ) and the nachos. Who could believe someone could mess up nachos?? They bring out a burned mess of chili dumped on stale chips with a glob of sour cream on top. The first thing out of my friend's mouth is ""where is the cheese?"" We eventually found the cheese under the chips, crusted onto the plate. The kind of crusted on where you use a fork to pry it off and it has the consistency of the burned edge of a grilled cheese sandwich. This could have been overlooked if the chili was not absolutely disgusting. It obviously was the powdered kind that you have to add water and warm up and was not done properly because the middle of the chili chunks was still dehydrated powdered meat and beans! All this would have made for a less than desirable experience but the straw that broke the camels back was the behavior of one of their buss boys. We had been seated in one of those 2 seaters where one side shares a long bench with two other tables and the other side has individual chairs. Anyway we were sandwiched between two other 2 person parties who finished and left around the same time. The buss boy came to clean up the tables and set the dirty dishes bin full of glasses and dirty plates right  on the bench directly next to my friend and started loudly tossing half full glasses and dirty plates into it. Then he proceeded to do the same thing  with the table on the other side of us. He finished and while he was leaving he bumped her shoulder with the bin full of sloshing drink glasses  and dirty dishes  and did not say anything! I understand you have to clean up tables but do you really need to put your dirty bin on the same seat as one of your customers and then when you accidentally bump them with a nasty tub you don't say anything??  Between the gross food and insanely bad service I personally will never be back.

Jenny C.,"Golden, CO",152,578,110,2.0,4/1/2013,"Both times I've been here, I had the fish and chips. On our most recent visit, there were very few fries included with my meal. The fish comes in 4 battered pieces, and it's decent. I found I needed to use all my and my husband's lemons, and add salt. My son enjoyed his pepperoni pizza and ate most of it. The mountain mud pie was okay, although it could have thawed a little before service, as it was rock hard.  The service on our last visit was terrible. She took a long time to greet us (besides saying ""just a minute""). We gave her our drink orders, along with our appetizer order, and told her to come back for the dinner order, since we hadn't decided on that part yet. It took a lot longer for our kids' drinks to come out. I realize that chocolate milk comes from the bar, but it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes for them to be ready after we receive ours.  We were two chips into our artichoke dip, which took a long time to come out, when they brought our dinner out. Then when we were about halfway through dinner, she asked if we wanted 'to-go' boxes and/or dessert and didn't take note of our empty glasses, which we set at the end of the table. Before taking our dessert orders, she brought out balloons, which was a nice gesture, but we would have preferred for those at the end of our meal. We ate our dessert, during which she refilled our drinks and dropped off the check, standing up. She checked again and put our check holder flat on the table ""since we weren't ready to go."" I took the kids to wash their hands while my husband paid the bill. She still hadn't come by to pick it up by the time we came back from the restroom.  We felt rushed our whole meal and we didn't enjoy it as much. It was not worth the $60 we paid for it.

It has those yummy fried onion strips on it. You can also order clam strips as a appetizer even though it is not listed on the menu.

When we got our food 2 of the 4 burgers were dry, and burnt. Sent them back. New burgers came out slightly juicier, but still not flavorful.

What now floats my boat is their tavern double burger. In spite of having two patties (not my normal pick), it's smaller than all of the other burgers on the menu. It's also cheaper at just $6.99 (and about half the calories and fat grams too, if you dare to look at their nutritional info). But during football season, when the Broncos get two sacks, their tavern double is free with another purchase on the Tuesday after the game! That burger reminds me of a Smashburger with muuuch thinner patties, a smaller and softer egg type bun and even a ""smash sauce"" type of condiment. I seriously love it.  I also like their rotating seasonal tap because I've tried a bunch of brews there that I'd never have picked on my own, especially a variety of Sam Adams seasonals, most of which I've liked even though I hate their Boston lager. The servers and bartenders surprisingly know a lot about their beers. Side note: if they bring you a beer and you don't like it, they will bring you something different out right away. They also have Alaskan Amber on tap which is pretty dang hard to find in Colorado, and one of my favorite basic easy-drinking beers. Another side note: this is actually an alt bier, not an amber! Yum. Their draft, well, marg and wine prices are ridiculously cheap during their twice daily happy hour which we caught last night at 8:30pm. I had a glass of wine for $2.50! My husband's schooner of craft beer was $4.

Jeremy C.,"Denver, CO",195,59,23,2.0,4/15/2012,"Red Robin: A chain restaurant that specializes in overpriced hamburgers and ""bottomless"" this and that. Needed more flair for sure.  Despite calling ahead to make reservations for our party of 13, which were accepted over the phone, we were notified upon arrival that Red Robin does not take reservations. WTF? Fortunately, the wait was mostly bearable and nobody had to run next door to (shudder) Bennett's for some survival chow. My burger was plain and tasted fine except for the lack of anything resembling meat flavor. The ""bottomless"" fries were OK but were greatly improved by a generous dash of the ""bottomless"" imitation Lawry's seasoning salt and a few squirts of the ""bottomless"" house ketchup.  Those of us who wanted mustard had to share a single bottle that someone in our party had to go steal from the kitchen area. The tortilla soup was tepid, gelatinous, and as exciting as a trip to a gas station restroom. My ""bottomless"" root beer float was soft serve and root beer. Could any less effort be expended?

First off, the atmosphere in there had everyone at my table feeling uncomfortable. I know having worked at red robin that when cooking a burger your customer should be fed within about 10 min. We waited about 20-30 min for our food, during our wait I discovered our silverware had a huge chunk of lettuce on it so got up and asked for a new one. The waitress grabbed a new knife looked at both sides and gave it to me only for me to realize it also had food on it. We got our food finally and to no surprise my burger was undercooked, fries were also undercooked and flimsy.

Mason H.,"Denver, CO",3,95,29,1.0,10/12/2013,"Avoid like the plague, the poor service plague. I've been here twice since the complete redesign. First time took me off guard and the Royal burger I ordered just sucked and totally disappointed compared to what I had remembered and loved. But that's not the point of this review... So my most recent experience was what convinced me to never again visit this RR (maybe all RR). I came because I had a birthday reward on my Royalty Card and was hankering for a delicious burger. The place was practically dead and there were many many tables open but where were we sat? Next to a huge family table with crying babies! Geez thanks. Course they didn't start crying till after we placed our order and got our waitressed pissed at us, which brings me to my next point. I was informed that my birthday burger wouldn't actually be taken off the tab, but instead the cheapest burger would be removed. Wth, how is that worth it when I order a $12 burger and my guest orders a cheapo $6 regular? So I say I want separate tabs so I don't stick my friend with a high bill because of my overpriced burger and $4 lemonade. So then the waitress totally takes on a sour attitude and starts answering with single words and dirty looks, geez. So the babies start to cry, the chairs suck, the water tasted like shit because of the recent flooding and our waitress is avoiding us and acting like a total B. Which is why I didn't ask to move, whatever, just wanted to eat and leave. Didn't even care to speak to manager since I will for sure most definitely never go back. Fries were cold and limp, burger was pink when ordered med no pink, and by the time we were done and offered a sundae for my Bday I just couldn't wait to get out of there, so I politely declined, paid, tipped (we all have bad days so who knows what was really up with her) and vowed that was the last time. I don't recommend this place. The wait-staff seems extremely inexperienced and uncaring or fake, and there was no sign of a manager anyway.

The first time I had noticed was a few months ago. We had waited about 30 minutes AFTER we were done eating to receive our check. Then another long wait for our waitress to take it. We had to put the big guy on-top the little book at the edge of the table for her to finally pick it up. They were not busy at all so we don't know what the hold up was. A Monday at 8. Then just a few weeks ago we came back. That was because I just turned 21 and wanted to experience my first public legal drink. Well the waitress we had was rude. I had asked a simple question (Just moved to Colorado). I asked her even though I am 21 and my ID says im a minor, Colorado state License, but my birthday states that it was my birthday a few days prior of coming to the restaurant, if I could still drink or do I need to wait to get a new id. She was looking around the room and said ""no you have to have an id"" I told her I had an ID telling you I am 21, but I don't have a new new one yet. Well then she avoided the question, said, ""like a glass of water? great I will be right back for you all."" and left. None of us WANTING glass of water. Well I shrugged it off, fine whatever. Well she came back IN A HURRY to leave once again. We told her we were ready to order our food and drinks. Well it came my turn to order and I wanted their fruit smoothie. She gave me a smart remark, ""You know there is no alcohol in there right?"" I could NOT believe she even said that. I told her I knew that's why I HAD to order it. She rolled her eyes! I was furious at that point. I wanted to talk to the manager, but I didn't feel like making a scene. I was actually going to let it go at that point. Well, we received our food, ate for a minute, and she brings us our check. Like really? Are you not going to ask if we would like it separate or dessert (Which my sister-in-law and I wanted after we ate). Well my husband wanted more fries. We tried catching her and she completely ignored us. Well lets just say we didn't get our dessert and she got a very low tip. That completely ruined my night. Where I am from there is NO Red-Robin.

Lari-Ann R.,"Arvada, CO",30,12,,1.0,9/18/2011,"I came here for homecoming with a group of ten people and a reservation, but we all still had to wait twenty minutes to get seated at the bar. Seating ten teenagers at the bar in seperate tables and areas should have been our first indication of how bad the service was going to be all night.  We all had bottomless drinks, but we spent much more time waiting and asking for refills than actually getting drinks. Getting any sort of attention from a passing waiter was a battle in itself. Personally, i had a waiter walk by and ignore me twice. Between the ten of us, we probably asked for a re order of steak fries at least five times, but no one ever got a single order. Although all of our orders were taken at the same time, by different waiters too, the food came out seperately. Two people get their food; wait ten minutes; four more people get their food; wait twenty minutes; two people get their food; wait five minutes;  the last two people got their food after over half the table was finished eating. I was the last person to get my burger after everone, so I was always watching the clock.  After watching all my friends eat their food, I was even more disappointed to find that the waiter had mixed up my order. I got my friend's date's rare burger, and he got my over well burger. We asked the waiter to swap out our orders,  and he said ""Ya no prob"", and he didn't come back until twenty minutes later when he came with the check. Exhausted by our attempts, we sucked it up and ate our cold and unappetizing food, minus the steak fries we continually asked for. However, it was okay because we didnt get to finish our meals because most of our group was ready to leave by the time we were halfway done anyways.  I understand that it gets hectic on a saturday night, but service should never be this awful, especially after you just spent all afternoon prettying yourself up for senior homecoming. I've been to this Red Robin a few times in the past and had okay service, mind you, it has never been on the ""great"" side of the spectrum. It was unfortunate that i was the one who recommended going here for dinner, and I ended up with the shittiest dining experience of my life.

One of our favorite things about RR is getting the bottomless fries while you wait for the rest of your party and look over the menu. A couple of months ago they started making us order BEFORE we got any fries. That was bothersome, but the last time we went in was the final straw. Now they are actually CHARGING $1.99 for the ""free"" fries. That's like a mexican restaurant charging for the chips & salsa.

Mark S.,"Denver, CO",309,333,74,4.0,2/18/2013,"You've most likely already been to a Red Robin at some point in your life. Or at the very least, you've heard those annoying ""Yuummmmmmmmmmm"" commercials they've had running for the past few years. Red Robin is like an Applebee's for burgers. Often scoffed at, but they've gotta be doing something right to have so many restaurants open, right? I've been to Red Robin a few times and have always gotten the famous Royal Red Robin burger (with a fried egg on top). This time I opted for the Guacamole Bacon burger, which comes dressed with guacamole, bacon, swiss cheese, tomatoes, onion, and mayo. With bottomless steak fries it checks out at $9.99. They also ask if you want it ""pink or no pink"" in the middle, which I kind of like as a cop out for them. Besides the dirty undertones, that question leaves them a lot of wiggle room. There's no attempt on their part to cook it EXACTLY how you order it, which we all know rarely happens. And yes, you have to get a little pink in the middle. Here's the crazy part: You know how major restaurant chains take ridiculous pictures of their food for advertisements, and it looks NOTHING like that in real life (See Red Robin pic in the gallery below)? Well, this time, it pretty much looks like advertised. Cut this burger in half, and it stands up big and tall just like the pics. And oh by the way, it tastes as good as it looks.

I showed her how pink the half of my burger was and she asked me if wanted it cooked more. ""Yes, I'm sorry, I can't eat this."" Meanwhile, my son ate his meal and no one came by for 15 min, by then my son was done with his burger and he asked for more fries. The manager brought my meal, apologized and we asked again for more fries for my son. I indicated that my son is already finished with his burger so ""can I get my meal to go?""  Cory brought my meal in a to-go box. Still no fries for my son. Then the waitress asked if we needed anything and at this point I'd had it.  I asked to speak with the manager...waited about 5 minutes. Cory came back and asked, ""what can I do for you?"" I replied, ""What can you do?"" He offered to give me dessert. Wait. 45 minutes of waiting and he wants to give me dessert? ""No, I don't want dessert. I really just want to go and I don't want to have to pay for my meal. He said ok and walked away. We waited for the receipt so I could pay, for about 5 min and the manager walked by. I asked him if I can have a receipt and he advised I could use the tablet at the table. I didn't know how to use the thing so he pushed a couple buttons and said my meal had been taken off the order and walked off. I then noticed a $1.99 (Entertainment Fee)!? I pressed the button to ask for the server and waited...The manager walked by and I told him ""there's an entertainment fee,I'd had enough entertainment for one night and I don't want to pay this."" He said he'll get my server. Waited about 5 min and the server looked upset. I asked for a receipt and she asked if I wanted to see it before I gave her my credit card. ""Yes please."" She left and came back shortly, I reviewed it and gave my card. I informed the manager I would never return. He didn't seem to care,he just walked off. I wrote on the receipt that the manager needed better customer service skills.

Clay M.,"Westminster, CO",1,5,,3.0,3/5/2012,"This is a place I've tried sporadically over the years, and always found good but not outstanding. Yesterday I found myself in the area and, since I was in the mood for a burger (which I usually am), decided to try it again. I had the peppercorn burger and found it... okay. The best thing about it was the little onion strings liberally scattered atop the patty (I love those things!), but other than that it was a pretty routine sandwich. I think the standard for a good burger is rising these days, what with places like Smashburger, Five Guys, and Larkburger appearing all over the Denver landscape, so maybe Red Robin needs to step things up a bit with a little fresher ingredients and higher quality beef (not that there's anything inferior about either now, they just didn't really rise above the competition). I'd say the steak fries are also fairly standard, but the fact that they're an all-you-can-eat proposition makes them an excellent value (but I swear I only had one modest refill besides my original order!). My Blue Moon Ale was tasty, especially after a morning outside in windy weather, which really made me thirsty. The waitstaff was also very polite and reasonably prompt, and seemed to be holding up well under the onslaught of families with little kids that stormed the place while I was there (eat here before noon on a weekend if you like quiet dining!). Overall it was a pleasant experience. Next time I'm in the neighborhood and hungry, I'm sure I'll go back again. There are some interesting chicken and fish items on the menu, so if I can overcome my seemingly unlimited addiction to cheeseburgers, maybe I'll find something to get a little more excited about for my re-review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=100

People who don't know good food come go this place! The bartender wouldn't even take my order for the first 15 minutes. Every one else in the group got their order taken. She apparently had issues that night. But for suburbia food, it's still crap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=100
Alexis R.,"Denver, CO",104,47,3,5.0,2/22/2014,"We eat here once a week, so maybe thats why they're so nice to us, also the rewards card actually saves money we often get whole meals taken off the tab, never any complaints, keep the good work up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=100
Tom W.,"Arvada, CO",1,30,1,1.0,11/30/2008,"Sung like the commercial: ""Dead Robin!  ...Y-U-U-U-CK!"" My favorite place for burgers in Denver is a little place on the northwest edge of town.  The burger is always cooked exactly the way I want it, favoring the rare side, but with nice caramelization on the outside.  Fresh tomato, onion, etc...  They make fantastic steaks too.  There's only one table, but the meal is always free to guests.  Only catch, you have to be invited because this is my house. I'm a little baffled about going out for a ""gourmet"" burger, but on occasion I can be cajoled into trying a new place.  I'll go along if that's what the gang wants to do.  But I avoid this place. What is there to recommend?  A zoo-like atmosphere with a thousand screaming kids (and I like kids!), a ho-hum burger (They all are, unless you go to the place I mentioned above.), and fries over-salted in a desperate attempt to get you to run up a bar bill.  They have thought of lots of different ways to serve a burger.  I guess I'd recommend reading the menu for ideas for next time you barbecue.  Oh yeah, I don't recall anything of the non-starch vegetable species on the menu, other than lettuce.  Green beans ROCK with a burger. Funny anecdote.  Years ago I went here with coworkers, one of whom was/still is in a wheelchair.  A car pulled into a handicapped spot about the same time we did, but we noticed the people wouldn't get out of the car while we were in sight.  We eventually surmised that they had a handicapped tag so their morbidly obese asses wouldn't have to walk all the way across the parking lot and they were embarrassed to get out of the car in front of someone who had real spinal damage. Anyway, I'm guessing this place is all about the kids (except for the bar, which is all about exhausted moms & dads).  But if you care about your children please challenge them by going somewhere on occasion where they have to behave and where they try something really good and interesting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=100

Amanda M.,"Arvada, CO",0,1,,4.0,4/19/2015,"Overall my experience was great. It was busy but we were sat quickly, Earl was prompt and got everything right, but as a server myself I don't agree with how things are done here. It took 20 minutes to get a fry refill because the kitchen was backed up and we were sat next to a larger party that had a woman seated at it that had a hard time getting out of her seat because our table was too close to theirs. When they got up so did the table next to them and the manager immediately came down to tell him they were putting two parties down at once. That is not a way to treat your employees or your guests. Sure, they got sat quicker but it results in the server rushing the dining experience and usually it's obvious that they are overwhelmed. That is not the ideal dining experience. I think they need to work on their seating techniques and the host staff in general. But other than that complaint our service was great and I would give Earl and the servers around him five stars for their friendliness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=100
Jason M.,"Westminster, CO",66,158,3,2.0,9/4/2008,"Perhaps I'm getting crotchety as I sneak up on middle-age, but there are certain things I expect when I go to a restaurant.  I expect that there will be a spoon available to stir the sugar into my iced tea, and that I shouldn't have to ask for one. I expect that, when ordering a burger, mayo/ mustard/ ketchup should at least come on the side. You shouldn't have to hunt down your waitress, ask for the condiments, then have her look at you like you just honked her hooter. I also expect that, when you discuss your plans to make a movie time with the waitress, then ask for the check in the same conversation, she will actually bring you the check in a timely fashion. I could go into detail about the condition of the restrooms (pre-dinner-rush) at this point, but I think my job here is done.

Dorian H.,"Denver, CO",101,213,15,3.0,9/8/2009,"There's a couple things that keep bringing me back to Red Robin. #1. I like their steak fries. #2. I am a fan of the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. That is some greasy goodness! The employees have always been friendly, but the actual service has never been great. I always get nervous when a) the waiter doesn't write the order down b) comes back to the table a few times to reaffirm the order c) the food still doesn't arrive to the table correctly. Yikes!

Terry J.,"Denver, CO",8,5,,5.0,1/16/2014,"I went here with my 5 year old daughter.we had went to the one in Westminster at first since it was the closest one to us but when we got there the place was a little but the greeter didn't even greet us.she just stared at us Without saying a word. Finally after after about 5 minutes i went up to her and ask how long of a wait was there she said about 20 minutes and then had the nerve to ask me if i wanted to be put on the waiting list after starring at me for 5 minutes. So I grabbed  my daughter and left but I was still in the mood for red robin I decided  to try this location and I am glad I had did the service here was excellent. From the greeter who greeted us right away to the wait staff who went out of their way to make our visit a good one.from bringing my daughter another balloon without me even asking for another one after my daughter had accidentally pop the first one to bringing our food out in a reasonable amount of time and prepared the way we had order.and refilling our drinks and fries,without me having to ask or beg for more  like other places i been too.Oh and the food was pretty good too but the service is what makes this red robin special to me",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=120
Greg Q.,"Denver, CO",36,17,50,2.0,7/8/2012,"Went to Red Robin yesterday with my Wife and Daughter and we have not been there in a while.  When we sat down we were looking over the new menu and it looked like some really good changes were made.  Our server came over to get our drink order and came back promptly for our food order.  I ordered the fish and chips and my Wife and Daughter were going to share a Royal Red Robin burger. Both of these dishes come with bottomless fries. Like we do EVERY time we go there my wife ask from some fries to start with and some ranch. We waited and waited and no fries came. I asked the waiter he then told me it was a new rule that they can not bring any out before the meal and he said he thought it was a stupid rule and he would bring some out.  Well, our meals came and we never got fries to start with.  I asked to speak with a manager because the waiter should have given me the option to order fries as an appetizer or maybe even have my fries first and no fries with my meal or at the very least to tell me about the rule after I asked when placing my order not right before my food came,  The Manger came over and crouched by the table and started giving me a story about why the do not allow fries first and stated it was because people will ask for fries first then order a bunch of salads.  I told him that it would have been good of him to come out and ask why I wanted to speak with him instead of assume and go off on a rant about their rules even though we had ordered our food already before asking for fries so his explanation didn't really mean squat to me at that point.  This is not the first time we have had issues with this Red Robin as a matter of fact last time the situation was much worse and that is why we had stopped going there for so long.  I guess it's time not stop going there again. I understand rules and I have no problem following them but customer service is about giving options and I did not get any.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=120

I had the california avacado chicken sandwich..it was good, but I have def had better. my husband got a wrap...not quite sure what he thought of it.

Shawn J.,"Henderson, NV",450,792,202,2.0,12/12/2009,"Every restaurant has an off night. Things happen. But my most recent visit to this particular Red Robin left me very disappointed. For the first time in a very long time I ended up sending my food back to the kitchen because it was cold. And the steak fries had to be sent back as they tasted more like ice fries than steak fries. The greasy, soggy, but now semi-warm second batch of steak fries was sitting in a pool of grease 1/4 inch deep and that's where they stayed. I ate two of them off the top and spit them back out. The two others with me voiced similar complaints about their orders. Our server was great, but the manager who brought our second orders out to us didn't adjust the bill. I ended up paying the equivalent of $20 per person for soggy and cold food and iced tea that rated barely above the taste of Lipton Instant Tea. The only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review is our server hustled. But I seriously doubt I'll ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=120

Levi D.,"Rifle, CO",0,8,,1.0,5/12/2013,"Woah, what happend to this place!  I haven't eaten at a Red Robin in a couple years as we've moved out of the Denver area, but when we did live here we loved Red Robin.  We popped in the other day and were very disappointed.  This location has remodeled and we don't like it at all.  It now has a very stark somber feel to it where before it was an energetic fun place to visit.  They are clearly changing their model and I don't think it's for the better. The burger wasn't very good, I think they have made them smaller and the meat isn't as high quality as it was.  The first fries our server brought us were stone cold and we didn't get fresh ones until we had finished our burgers.  The service was poor and slow, which went well with the new atmosphere created by their remodel.  Even the uniforms are bland now; they used to wear bright, chearful colors, now everyone is in black.  Not sure what Red Robin is going for but I won't ever go back to this Red Robin. If the other locations are going this same direction we'll be done all together.  Our over-all experence wasn't by any means the worst dinning we'ver ever had it just wasn't Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=120
