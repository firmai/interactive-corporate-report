Steve S.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",2697,262,51,3.0,10/28/2013,"This is the second Applebees that I had the chance to eat at when I traveled to this town.  I really liked the menu and the service.  Food was good and the drinks were excellent. It would only get noisy when there was thunder and lightning storms or if the little league world series was in town.  Other than that, everything is generally quiet there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Michael D.,"Spring Branch, TX",58,11,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Couldn't have been much worse, except the server was nice. I was served nearly frozen mashed potatoes! How does that even happen? The steak I got was completely inedible--charred on the outside and cold on the inside, completely rubbery, and half gristle. It wasn't even worth complaining too hard about, all I wanted to do was leave and never come back! (And I've always loved Applebee's!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Ali D.,"Fort Rucker, AL",3,2,,5.0,10/14/2015,Kiara was the most amazing server I have had In a long time! The food was good and I would go back in a heart beat to see her! She was very sweet and so nice!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Phillip H.,"Savannah, GA",0,5,1,1.0,3/30/2016,I ordered the bourbon steak and got butter with a hint of steak that was rare and butter with broccoli as a side. The mashed potataos were excellent with a hint of potato and an overwhelming taste of mayonnaise.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Sofia R.,"San Antonio, TX",2,58,2,5.0,3/18/2014,I was staying in dothan and Applebee's was right in front of the hotel. It was easy to walk to Applebee's and back. Great service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Dana H.,"Richardson, TX",27,131,7,1.0,3/24/2010,"The last time we ate here was awful. The music was deafening, the food was wrong and the air was too cold. This place is off our list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Kevin F.,"Rockledge, FL",2,13,1,3.0,8/27/2010,"Typical Applebee's. I was able to get them to turn the TV to the ball game that I wanted to watch. The food was ok, no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Sandra D.,"Enterprise, AL",0,10,4,4.0,12/20/2010,Superfast service.  Good food.  TVs can be loud on game day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
Dan K.,"Seattle, WA",9,76,2,2.0,6/12/2007,"The food's consistent and the bar is quick.  Granted, it's still an applebee's, but what can you do?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-dothan-3
