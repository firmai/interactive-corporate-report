12,Timmy E.,"Philadelphia, PA",179,2,,1.0,2015-08-19,Place is terrible took 3 hours for food. No one knows what's going on. Told me we didn't ask for you to come here you came here. Staff is completely rude. By all means drive down the Black Horse like 15 more minutes to the other one trust me it will be well worth it. It took 5 hours for a dinner. I would give them no stars but yelp won't allow it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
10,Geoff F.,"Littleton, CO",1,6,,1.0,2015-08-30,"Two of us ordered a 2-orders-for-$25 special, of which one of those orders was ribs. Additionally, one of us ordered fish and chips and substituted sweet potato fries in place of the chips. When all the orders arrived 45 minutes later, the ribs and the sweet potato fries were burnt. When we complained, the waitress said she would call the manager. The manager showed up almost half an hour later and said ""We'll replace the ribs, which should take 10 minutes, and the sweet potato fries will take 2 minutes."" We said that instead of the ribs, we would opt to have a sirloin instead. The replacements only arrived another half hour later, and by that point we had just shared the fish and chips order to satiate our hunger. Because of a lack of appetite due to how long we had been there, we asked for to-go boxes and the bill. When the bill arrived, not only had they still charged for the 2-for-$25 deal, but they charged an additional $11.95 for the sirloin. We called the waitress again, and once more she said she would call the manager. We said not to call him, because we didn't want to see him again; the manager is the real problem here. When all was said and done, the only compensation we received was removing the already bogus additional charge of $11.95. A good manager would have removed the charge for the original order that was burnt, or perhaps provided some other kind of monetary compensation, given the outrageous amount of time we spent here. Unless the management changes around here, we can't recommend this Applebees to anybody.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
11,M G.,"Pitman, NJ",0,68,79.0,2.0,2015-09-01,"Came in for dinner. Overall impression was good. Very crowded but lacking substance. My waitress was terribly inexperienced. Ordered burgers. Got our meals mixed up. Why do waitstaff stand around with plates in the air asking ""who ordered this"" when they just took the order 10 minutes before? I don't think I'll return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
14,Angela M.,"Williamstown, NJ",0,5,,5.0,2015-10-02,"Finally were able to get here to enjoy a great meal since we have always loved Applebee's and this one had just opened.  Had dinner there with my family and we enjoyed everything that we ordered, as expected and as always.  Everything came out as it was supposed to.  Waitstaff was polite and attentive.  Manager was very nice.  Will definitely be back there as much as possible and I highly recommend going there.  But if you are one to complain, stay home and do everyone else a favor, as I don't agree with any of the other reviews.  There will always be people in this world that like to complain and nothing is ever good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
13,Dora A.,"Berlin Township, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2015-11-16,"Went in for lunch,  I ordered the ribs, my husband ordered a burger,  it was horrible, food was cold , burger was raw, waitress was clueless and the manager didn't offer anything other than an apology and a promise to do better next time...next time won't be happening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
7,Daniel S.,"Williamstown, NJ",0,20,,1.0,2016-04-19,"Honestly the worst Applebees I have ever went too. Never had my dinner go correct here . Forget food , comes out cold ,forget kids drinks and manager always has an excuse . I just wanna sit and eat with the family . Try one of the other locations around here . Just bad all around .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,

9,Patricia L.,"Monroe Township, NJ",55,3,,1.0,2016-07-05,"My family and I went here for a celebration a few nights ago. We love apple bees but we were very disappointed this trip. The food was awesome as always however our server, Courtney was rude. As I former server, I can't believe she talked to guests in such fashion. When she asked what sides a member of the table wanted she said ""nope not on the menu, try again"" in a very condescending tone. Also, when she brought over plates for appetizers (there were 7 of us) she piled up all the plates, forks, AND KNIVES on top of one another and when my sister tried to fix it, the whole tower fell over. She replied ""throwing things now?"" Then when the appetizers came out, there was a dish in the middle of the table she said in a very mean tone, ""do me a favor and move that"" I don't know if she was just having a bad day, or if her customer service is that poor, but eye rolling and snarky remarks to customers is never acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,

6,Doris K.,"Asbury Park, NJ",20,3,,1.0,2017-03-24,"negative stars - don't eat there! i got food poisoning!!! under cooked food.  i spit it out the second peice and still got sick from digesting. had to go to urgent care.  very, very sick.  Update, corporate calls me and offers me a gift card.  Won't refund my money but will give me a gift card.  That's crazy $49 is worth losing customers.  DON'T GO THERE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
2,Iam B.,"Williamstown, Williamstown, NJ",0,5,,2.0,2017-05-05,"So, I really like Applebee's as a restaurant chain, but this location is absolutely terrible. They don't even provide you with the right amount of food you're supposed to receive for each dish, especially when ordering car side to go, I usually get the 4 cheese pasta and honey lemon pepper chicken(it's super delicious) but they don't even cover the bottom of the carry-out container and or plate with the pasta. Very cheap for this location, considering how busy it gets. They should know how to order depending on their schedule and how busy it gets, so that's not an excuse. Would not recommend, especially on busy days/nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
3,Min L.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,1,1.0,1.0,2017-08-25,never eat steaks here. the servers here in this applebees locations are OK. but the food was awful. the steak i ordered was supposed to be medium rare but came out burned on the outside! i could barely cut the steak. this is also not the first time this has happened.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
0,Lauren H.,"Pitman, NJ",11,10,4.0,5.0,2017-08-30,I just came back from my birthday lunch and our waitress Christy was great!! She was very friendly and attentive. Great customer service!! I would definitely go back again and ask for her.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
1,Zem A.,"Bayside, NY",2,42,6.0,1.0,2017-12-24,Several years now since this location has opened and they still can't get the orders right.  They over cook or undercook the meat.  French fries missing.  But somehow they never forget to upcharge for added items.  This applebees needs to be shut down.  Nothing but disappointment time after time.  Go to turnersville Applebee's it's worth the longer drive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-williamstown-4,,,,,
