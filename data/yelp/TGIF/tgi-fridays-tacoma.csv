Hailee P.,"Auburn, WA",3,67,1,4.0,7/7/2008,"The people that work there are extremely friendly. The flavors in the dishes I've had so far, have been so saviory. The deserst I had there was to die for. This place absolutely had my taste bugs crying for more. Yeap and I do agree that, It maybe has improved since 2006. Try it for yourself. I would recomend this over Red Robins & Applebee's any day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tacoma
Michael K.,"Seattle, WA",299,631,40,2.0,2/8/2010,"When I lived in Minnesota, me and my co-workers would go to Friday's all the time, and the experience was always a good one.  And that isn't just because I was dating one of the waitresses!   Most of these restaurants are pretty much identical.  A combination of booths and tables all fanning out around a centralized bar, with the screaming kids and families generally segregated to one half of the restaurant.  Smart business.   This one is no different, and for that, I have little complaint.  The setup is fine, and the bar is ok, although who goes to a place like Friday's just to get drunk? Yuppies, that's who. Anyways, there are three things I used to get all the time, and only one of them is done well at this location.  The mudslide.  I know, girliest drink of all time, but I gotta be honest, I like getting drunk off of Chocolate milkshakes.  And the fact that they put enough chocolate chips in the bottom to make a batch of cookies kinda thrills me.  Buried treasure, if you ask me. So, one of my favorite dishes of all time (from a mildly crappy american food joint) was the sizzling chicken and cheese.  Simple dish - Two chicken breasts, marianted and flash grilled in a skillet over a bed of green peppers, onions, and tons of cheese, with mashed potatos.  Delicious and not complicated.  Ok so when they brought it out this time, there was literally a piece of american cheese sitting on the top, 1/3 melted.  I'm not hard to please, but that made me throw up just a little bit in my mouth.  Un-freakin'-acceptable. The other travesty?  The spinach and artichoke dip.  Once again, not the hardest thing to do right, if you have good directions.  Maybe it was just the chef that day, maybe it was bad karma, I don't know... The fact is... It tasted like a bag of frozen spinach, thawed in a jar of salsa con queso, although to be honest, i think i would have enjoyed that more. One thing I'll always be a fan of is Friday's drink menu.  I don't know if maybe they just staff a much more efficient bar than kitchen, but we always seem to leave happy, if only because we're often too drunk to remember how bad the food was.  Anyways, you all are probably already smart enough not to go here, but just in case, don't.  They have potential, like so many family style American restaurants, and yet their laziness or lack of dedication or whatever it is simply prevents them from really ever succeeding. Too bad, too, since their three course menu for 12.99 is a fantastic deal, if they just cooked sh*t well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tacoma
Terrance D.,"Seattle, WA",2,40,,2.0,1/22/2009,"I have lived on three different Hawaiian islands, Southeast Asia, Finland, Eastern Washington and now Seattle.  I have also traveled all over the world, and I must say, besides Lawrence, Kansas, Tacoma is the worst city on earth.  After watching Guy Fieri on the Food Network rave on and on about TGI Friday's, I decided to give it a try.  I was driving to Portland from Seattle to visit family and decided to stop at the Tacoma location.  I have one word that perfectly describes Tacoma: GHETTO.  The hostess was too busy texting on her phone to realize that we needed to put our name on the list.  Some ghetto bus boy stared at me up and down as if I just winked at his ghetto booty girlfriend.  Me and Dee then decided to sit at the bar, and everyone around us made the experience uncomfortable.  I felt bad for the wait staff because the Tacoma visitors kept giving them a hard time and complaining about everything.  I guess TGI Friday's is fine dining in Tacoma.  As for our waiter, he was excellent, even though he had to deal with the trash individuals and their repugnant attitude. As for the food, I thought it was pretty good.  Green bean fries, ribs, chicken strips and   potato skins.  Pretty typical pub food, but not bad at all.  My only suggestion would be to avoid Tacoma (at least the area by the mall) if you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tacoma
Judiy B.,"Spanaway, WA",2,25,,2.0,10/16/2006,"I wasn't expecting fine dining but I was expecting a good meal with good service.  I set my sights too high.  I ordered the citrus shrimp and had to repeatedly say that I didn't want it breaded.  Then it came to me in a bowl of lemon butter.  That's the special ""citrus sauce"".  I sent it back and it came to me again, this time charred black with some pepper.  Not edible.  The people behind me complained that there chicken wings were cold.   This is a place to only go when you want to get drunk.  Not when you want to eat something edible sober.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tacoma
minji k.,"Federal Way, WA",3,63,,4.0,7/5/2008,"Actually, the time I went there was much different then the yelper underneath me. I had the Key lime shrimp which was 2 skewers of shrimp with lime and other seasonings. I thought it was soooo delicious. Our server was extremely nice and tended professionally to our needs. The atmosphere was chill and kind of family oriented which I loved. Maybe it's the fact that TGI Friday's has changed since Judiy has been there last but I can't wait to go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tacoma
