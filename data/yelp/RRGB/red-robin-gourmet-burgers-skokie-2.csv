Eric B.,"Skokie, IL",8,99,41,4.0,1/3/2018,"Does Red Robin make the best burgers?  IMHO, they're very good, not the best I've ever had, but here's why we've become loyal fans of this national chain:  1. Convenient location.  The Skokie restaurant is in a strip mall just around the corner from a multiplex cinema and has ample parking. 2. Extensive menu.  The burger selection features a mind-boggling array of combos and toppings, but the menu also offers other sandwiches and wraps, apps, entrées, and entrée-size salads.  Our faves include the Shrimp & Cod Duo and the BBQ Chicken Wrap. 3.  Service.  Consistently friendly and considerate.  Due to the enormity of menu options, mistakes happen.  On our most recent visit, the kitchen botched a sandwich.  While it was being remade (and without our asking or complaining), the server whisked a plate of fries to our table and then the manager stopped by to apologize.  She also comped the sandwich. 4. Walls.  That's right, this restaurant is divided into 3 rooms:  Families with children, teens and millennials, and the 21+ bar crowd.  Brilliant!  I sure wish more restaurants would do this. 5.  Bottomless fries.  'Nuff said. 6.  Red Robin Royalty. This is one of the better incentive programs out there.  You get a free Gourmet Burger during your birthday month, and freebies and discounts by email all year long.  The cost to sign up is free. 7.  Ziosk.  The interactive touchscreens found on each table are fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Lois L.,"Skokie, IL",165,59,208,4.0,11/19/2017,"I came here on a Sunday night with a friend for a quick bite. I like Red Robin if you're in the mood for a nice burger and fries for a reasonable price.  Service was just okay, our server did not come by and check on us as much as I would have liked considering it wasn't busy when we were there.  I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries and I love that they offer endless fries with almost every order!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Marie L.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,7,2.0,10/28/2017,"The appetizers are good and the burger was decent even though you cant get it cooked to your liking such as medium, med rare etc. your only options are pink or no pink. Why such a low rating? Because our sever Amanda absolutely sucked!  The place was not busy yet her service was mediocre. She made a drink that tasted like nothing but sour mix, never came to refill our waters or to check on us to ask how the food was or if we needed anything and didn't even bother to say goodbye or have a nice night or anything as she saw us leaving. The little 7$ tip we left was way too much.....she deserved nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Dev S.,"Chicago, IL",34,109,53,4.0,12/28/2017,Was my first experience at this wonderful burger place. Wanted to go here for years and finally it was destiny that brought me here today. Ordered the newly introduced Veggie Burger and was very happy with it. The bottomless fries and the ability to order different ones is awesome . Would definitely recommend Red Robin if in mood of a quality burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Tonya K.,"Matteson, IL",29,73,130,3.0,10/21/2017,"For starters we had a tower of onion rings with two different sauces. For my meal I had the black and blue turkey burger and bottomless fries. I was so full from my three onion rings that I could only take a small bite of my burger. However, what I did manage to eat was very tasty. My long island ice tea was just juice and tasted as if no alcohol was in it. The service was very attentive and responsive. Would return again but wouldn't order an alcoholic beverage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Samir M.,"Chicago, IL",2,18,,5.0,1/13/2018,"This is my go to spot for a good burger and fries. I've tried a few of the burgers and all of them were great!

Daniel M.,"Chicago, IL",88,64,95,5.0,8/19/2017,"Awesome burgers, bar, fries, and beer. This place is nice. It is clean. The bathrooms are good. The TVs are nice to see at the bar. Not bad draft prices. A birthday burger month is neat. Burgers are great tasting.  Just remember to ask for the Tabasco. They have unlimited steak fries which is neat.

Kanan D.,"Des Plaines, IL",105,43,19,2.0,7/20/2017,I am not sure why I was so excited to try burger place and this probably was not the best to try.  I ordered the Garden burger on a Ciabatta bread.  IT WAS COLD! The burger patty was not even warm not was the bread.  For appetizers we ordered the pretzel bites and onion rings and both were not great.  The cheese sauce on the pretzel bites was so disgusting.  Let's just say that my favorite thing was the house ranch......  Probably would give a 1 star but the server was very nice so added a star for her.  FOOD SUCKED...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Phil S.,"Sauganash, Chicago, IL",127,519,3655,4.0,3/12/2017,"Well I have been hearing about Red Robin from my sister Susan S. (Yelp Elite) for awhile so I thought I check it out.  As usual we were on the way home driving past Village Crossing on Central and as we were driving past it I said we really need to check Red Robin out sometime.  My wife surprised me by saying oh do you want to.  No sooner were the words uttered and I was pulling a U Turn going back to the restaurant that we just passed.   We arrived there this evening and had to do a double take because there were so many kids.  I thought I walked into a Chuckie Cheese by mistake. I ordered the Smoke & Pepper angus burger on a ciabatta bun w/cheddar cheese, bacon & bbque sauce.  The angus burger cooked medium rare the way I like my meat.  It was exquisite, great quality meat blended with cheddar (because everything is better w/cheddar)  bacon & bbque sauce.  The ciabatta bun gave the burger the slightly chewy texture that I really like.   My wife ordered a basic Red Robin burger cooked medium and that in itself took out a lot of the flavor in what I consider an over cooked burger (NEVER OVER COOK YOUR MEAT).  Both burgers came with unlimited steak fries, but for me it's not a huge selling point because I don't eat fries very often.  Still it is a nice selling feature Red Robin holds its burger ingredients to very strict standards; the beef is always fresh and never frozen, all-natural, domestic, and free of preservatives and added ingredients; and the produce is GMO-free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Christine D.,"Chicago, IL",180,69,112,1.0,11/25/2017,"Well this one star is generous.  After an evening seeing a tree lighting we just wanted to go somewhere for an easy meal like a burger where we could also get a drink with our child.  This restaurant ruined that dream.  After being sat by an unhappy hostess we then waited at least 25 minutes with NO ONE greeting us ever.  We had hit the call server button on the little piece of technology on the table and had to hit it a second time as no one came for the cycle of time it was blinking red.  During this time waiting I saw our server make sure and check in with at least three different tables he had who were finishing up more than once.  This included 2 tables next to us where we could have at least acknowledged us.  There was a woman who appeared to be a manager who could have come by while our red lighting was going off and greeted us but no, she wanted to bus tables, but it wasn't because people were waiting to be sat.  This was my first time here and I can say I have not even gotten to try a glass of water here, a doubt I will ever step into Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Aley M.,"Sumner, WA",161,263,6,1.0,3/23/2017,"Ok, this is really a problem with Amazon, but I had some things wrong in my order as well. I had Amazon delivery cued and ordered the food. It said 1 hour and we waited. And waited. And waited. I called Red Robin and got a pretty nasty man on the phone who told me to ""come pick it up"" at 8:15 pm. I asked him when it would be delivered. He did not know, it is sitting here. I was pretty upset. I called Amazon twice so I could find out the status and they wanted me to cancel the order! Finally I called to cancel and got the driver. She told me it was not received until 8:30 which is a full 1.5 hours from ordering. She was on her way. She came and we got the VERY COLD food. The root beer float was a mess. This cost me $35 mind you...for two people! There were no napkins, no forks, no condiments, no onion rings and so the entire thing was a clustering mess. The driver was nice and apologized, but I am not sure she was telling the truth about getting the order at 8:30 since when I called the dude said yes, the food is sitting here at 8:15 pm. Needless to say, I will NEVER go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2

Matt P.,"Park Ridge, IL",124,78,1,1.0,8/26/2017,"My family has been coming to this location for years and loves the wide variety of burgers on the Red Robin menu. The unlimited fries are a big draw, too. The service has been good at this location, even though we usually come on Saturday nights when they are packed. The last time I came however, I had an all-around terrible experience that really soured me on this location. With our one-year-old in tow, my wife and I were seated relatively quickly, but there was a bitterly cold draft emanating from the ceiling above us  We asked no less than four times--the hostess twice and our server twice--to get it turned down or reseat us. Nothing changed throughout the course of the meal, despite the waitress' insistence that she was doing something about it. In addition, we don't really see our waitress much once the food arrived, so I spent most of my meal with an empty Come and the unlimited fries are decidedly more limited when no one shows up to refill them. Thankfully another server took pity on me and made it happen. Beyond the service, the restaurant was filthy. There was salt from a giant pretzel all over the floor under our table. As we were leaving, my wife noticed broken glass mixed in to the mess under our table as well. Before leaving, I went to the men's room  On my way in, I noted a giant pile and trail of salt or sugar on the floor leading to the men's room. Yum! My final experience took the cake though. As I stood at the urinal, an employee--who had delivered our food--emerged from the stall, walked to the sink, quickly rinsed his hands without using soap, and left. I talked to the manager after this because I couldn't take it anymore and she said that I should have told her what was going on during our meal, not afterward. She also thankfully asked me to point out the guy with the potty hands. She gave me a coupon for a free appetizer, but I'm pretty sure I won't be using it at this location. Yuck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Steve E.,"Chicago, IL",0,30,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Tried Red Robin for the first time and it quickly became apparent that I was not missing anything.  Service was extremely poor, despite the fact that it was not busy.   In regard to the food, the burgers we ordered were truly no better than what we could have ordered at Burger King for a third of the price.  Steak fries were completely tasteless and had no seasoning.  Absolutely no reason to return to this or any other Red Robin ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Isaac A.,"Chicago, IL",19,41,4,3.0,5/17/2017,"VERDICT: Decent place for overpriced food and drinks.  The food is good but nothing special, and the cooks will get your burger meat exactly how you want it done whether you like it well or if you like it more rare.  The ambiance is cool and a bit intimate with the dimly lit lights.. Kinda bar-like lighting .. Seating is good.  Pros:  -Great Service -Great atmosphere -Hustle and bustle, always busy, tons of people -Good for a date for young people Cons: -Pricey food -Don't offer any type of steaks or alternatives to burgers except Salmon -Not many options on the menu besides burgers despite it being a dine-in restaurant environment. -Sometimes there's a wait to be seated..  This might sound a bit rude: but in all honesty, my friends told me I make better burgers at home.. P.S. Between 2 people and without desserts or any extras our tab was 56$ before tips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2

Anthony T.,"Chicago, IL",33,95,214,2.0,9/10/2016,"We decided on this for our dinner after realizing the line to Jollibee was still out the door. I had fond memories of Red Robin from when I lived on the East Coast and this experience was far from what I remembered. Our shoes slid on the greasy floor, the service lacked motivation, flies circled us as we had our meal. I chose onion rings as my side (not unlimited and for an up charge) only to find 5 rings beside my lack luster burger. Save your time and money and go elsewhere for a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
AJ K.,"Highland Park, IL",77,185,875,3.0,1/3/2016,"Here's what you need to know: This particular location is the least enjoyable Red Robin I've ever been to: it's DIRTY and the service is extremely slow and just plain mediocre. The staff needs a lot of motivation and training. However, the restaurant manager called me, asked me about the issues, listened keenly to my feedback, and vowed to make the problems right. As such, I am upping the rating from 2 stars to 3. We had to move tables because the smell was so pungent and nasty - in one of the 2 main sections of the restaurant (the third section is the bar and I kids are allowed) - that we almost lost our appetite. Thereafter it took our server over 15 minutes to come get our order... all this while our 2 year old was desperate to eat. Finally we order our burgers and drinks, and the food tasted very good (kudos to the kitchen), but the fried egg we requested be added to the sandwich was - not unexpectedly - left off. Moreover, we bought a gift card from the bar, and he transaction was done incorrectly. We ended up waiting for an additional 15 minutes to get that corrected after our meal was done and paid for. To her credit, the bartender/server who made the error was very sweet and apologetic. Overall, I would say that as enjoyable as the food is, I would avoid this location and visit some other RR restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2
Eric H.,"Skokie, IL",1,9,2,4.0,11/18/2017,My experience with this location was pretty good.

Patti L.,"South Side, Chicago, IL",134,132,267,1.0,6/20/2015,"The service was really bad on a Friday night. The endless fries is only for steak fries. You have to pay extra for the sweet potato fries. I've been to another one and they were included.  We had to ask for another server 2x's just to find our server.

The women's bathroom does smell like hamburgers, which is most likely because it's right next to the kitchen. Regardless, kind of off-putting. The service was quicker than I expected, though. We got in around noon and were done eating by 12:40.  I ordered the Arctic cod and fries, which is way more than I expected. It was four fish filets and a small amount of steak fries. Very tasty and good tartar sauce.

Kelli C.,"Chicago, IL",1,3,,2.0,2/22/2016,"Unfortunately Red Robin was changed.  We have previously dined here and it was ok. We were seated immediately to a table that had been wiped with a sour bar towel.  The table, seats and menus were also wet. The waitress was very slow and she admitted that she was sick.   We ordered, received our order of cold hamburgers and they forgot to add the avocado.  The salad was not fresh.  The lettuce was brown around the edges and looked like it came out of the bag not washed or cleaned.  As we were sitting waiting to be served my partner noticed something coming down from the ceilings.

Lindsey S.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,,2.0,2/12/2017,"The food was between okay and good.  My biggest issue was the service, specifically as it relates to the bottomless fries.  I went on a Saturday around 1:30pm.  It was busy but not full.  There were several empty tables in my section.  The serving of fries I got with my burger was very small.  Maybe 8 french fries.  Our waitress didn't come to check on us for about 10 min.  I tried getting her attention but she didn't look over and I didn't want to yell across the bar area.  I was finally able to order more fries but they took close to another 10 minutes.  I tried to eat my burger slowly to wait for the fries but also didn't want it to get cold.  I ended up finishing my burger right when the second round of fries arrived.  I don't understand why it takes so long if they're bottomless.  Shouldn't they be making fries on a regular basis rather than to order?  Bottomless is pointless if it takes 10-15 minutes to get your next order. We then waited to try to get a check.  We finally figured out, when we saw another table use it, that we could pay our bill on our own at this little computer at the table.  That would have been nice to know.  We thought it was just a menu and games so we set it off to the side. There are much better places to get burgers.  The fries may not be bottomless but you get enough that you won't need more.   The one thing I like is that the menu shows what you can substitute, if the sub is extra, and if the sub is bottomless.  I also like the page of the menu that shows ways to make your meal a little healthier. Our waitress was nice but it seemed like she was assigned to the entire bar area.  No one was helping her by refilling drinks, etc.  It seems a manager could go around the entire restaurant refilling fries, drinks, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=40

Jackie F.,"Hermosa, Chicago, IL",3,8,1,2.0,1/7/2016,"This is my 2nd visit to this location and I left disappointed by the bad service. It was one big flop of a night! I went to dinner last night with my friend and his 14 month old daughter. Our server took way too long to come to our table and once she finally arrived she left because she forgot something another table had asked for. She eventually came back and we put our drink orders in (1 water, a kid's juice and a beer). Those took forever to come to our table. She brought the water immediately but forgot about the juice and beer. Once our food arrived we had to ask for ketchup and napkins from the guy who brought the food to the table. Our server came by the table once during our meal so it was hard to ask for more fries since she wasn't around. She was nowhere to be seen during our meal. Food overall was good but wish I was able to enjoy more fries!  To add on to the bad service, my biggest disappointment was the lack of a changing table in the men's restroom. My friend tried to go change his daughter but had to come back to the table and ask me to help him. I had no problem doing it but what would have happened if I wasn't there?! As a family friendly restaurant I think it would be a good idea to have one installed for all the dads out there!

I don't know why, but I feel like a little kid again when I come in here. It is a happy environment to be in for some reason because you know you are about to stuff your face with an awesome tasting burger. Honestly, there are many good burger joints out there, but what brings me back here is the bottomless fries and freckled lemonade. The beauty about their lemonade is that you can switch to other flavors, so for the price of one, you can try the others. Also, if you have enough people, definitely get the towering onion rings! I have tried many of the sandwiches here before, but my favorite is the A1 Peppercorn Burger. I substitute the regular fries for the garlic fries, which is 10x better in my opinion. I have never left here feeling unsatisfied!

Last time our waiter explicitly stated that the bread was kept under a heat lamp after being baked in the AM. Gross. Entrees were good. But the service degrades the place and the unfriendly atmosphere is rancid. Fool me once... Fool me twice... Never a third!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=40

Gin G.,"Glenview, IL",12,146,472,2.0,7/9/2015,"Been here twice within a week span.  Watching the Hawks play n it was the only place that didn't have a wait to be seated.  Now I know why!   Love a good gourmet burger but this is not the place.  Went with a party of 6 n all got different burgers so we can taste each others.   I always try the basics when trying new places.  So I can taste the actual flavor of the meat without all the other stuff covering it up.  So I got  the plain one...hamburger (no chz) with lettuce tomato onion pickle.  Basic right?  But such a sad burger.  Sadly, none of them were as good as they looked/sounded on the menu.  Not even the one with the egg on it.  And I live a good egg on my burger!!  Buns were soggy. Couldn't really taste the flavor of the meat.  It was all just covered with sauces.  Not how I like my burgers.   Bottomless fries is good I guess but seriously how many baskets can one person eat???   But liked that they offer sweet potato fries.   Onion ring tower was impressive.  Crispy n tasty the first time but the second time we went it was greasy n undercooked.  Certain parts were not cooked n still doughy.  Like they were stuck together when cooking then pulled apart to put on the tower.  Hit or miss I guess. But the Donut tower for dessert was awesome!  Comes with some dipping sauces.  Best part of our meal.   So one star for sweet potato fries n one for the donut tower.  But gonna have to get my burgers elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=20
Mary R.,"Skokie, IL",0,55,5,5.0,5/28/2017,"Seven of us came at noon for a birthday lunch. This was better than our last visit, which was pretty good. Many different options ordered, and everyone was pleased. Everything was served properly by a delightful waitress, as were the other employees( especially the gal who brought out a complimentary humongous chocolate ice cream cake that served everyone.)  We never felt rushed, and the staff turn around time from orders to served food was perfect.  My BLTA, bacon, Lettuce, tomatoe, and avocado on a croissant was perfect. Last month at a far more expensive restaurant my Cobb salad had avacado which was blackened beyond acceptable and those folks were not impressed at my comment when the plate was finally removed, with all that avacdo left behind. Avacado is one of the most perishable foods but these folks can handle it.  That gaming and payment gadget on the table still annoys me, but I guess since I do not have to deal with it, it has become a part of the otherwise perfect experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=20

It was the first 80 degree day of the year and we were melting immediately walking into the place. The poor servers and kitchen workers! 2. Soda watered down to nothing. Our Coke and Dr. Pepper tasted the same.  3. We ordered the ""large"" buffalo wing appetizer. Firstly, it we the same size as the small $5 version we ordered last time.

Regina C.,"Chicago, IL",0,25,4,2.0,10/4/2016,Well the burger I paid nearly $14 dollars for...got to say NOT WORTH IT! Not even close. There was a little burger in the ciabatta bun two ultra thin slices of bacon that showed NONE of the peppercorns it was supposed to be crusted in and lettuce was virtually non existent.  I know the steak fries are bottomless but the initial serving was literally about a dozen fries and sitting there next to the $4 approximate value burger I just felt totally ripped off...and to be honest there are SOOOO many good burger restaurants. .Red Robin..I won't be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=20

Joani O.,"Skokie, IL",143,423,927,3.0,5/16/2015,"Today was a much better experience, at least food wise. My daughter wanted to go here for lunch after dance, so I agreed. I ordered the wedge salad appetizer and the boneless wings again, but this time with the sauce on the side. Much better! My daughter ordered a patty melt on marble rye, medium, with sweet potato fries, and the burger was cooked perfectly and very tasty. The downside was the dirty table on one side of us, which stayed that way the whole time we were there. The family on the other side of us left and their table remained dirty as well. There were many workers there, including what looked to be a manager walking around, yet no one seemed to notice these tables. This was very unappetizing. Unfortunately our main complaint was the service. Our server was very nice, but very inattentive. He took our order, brought our drinks and food, and we didn't see him again for a long time. He only checked on us once the entire time we were there. We had to look for him for salad dressing, extra napkins, refills on drinks, and worst of all, our check. We had finished eating and sat waiting for the check for a long while so we could leave. Mind you it was late afternoon and he had a few tables, but I couldn't imagine having him serve us at night when it's busier. We saw him a few times but he never made eye contact until I went out of my way to get his attention.

Ema B.,"Skokie, IL",0,5,,2.0,1/1/2017,"This dining experience was not good.... My previous experiences at this establishment have been OK, but this one was so lousy that I won't be back. Our waitress must've been working through a New Year's Eve hangover because she wasn't cognizant of her job expectations. I know waiting tables is not easy, but still...she brought the food out at room temperature, and late. Items kept falling out of her apron. She'd walk past our table, speak to us about our order, and then continue talking as she walked away. She wasn't rude per se, just odd. Furthermore, for as long as we waited for our cool (as in temperature) food, we still had to ask for forks, napkins, etc. Then, she couldn't figure out our bill and even confused ours with another party's. And she only had 3 tables. We sat, and sat....and sat some more... And then came Ron, and he helped us eventhough he wasn't assigned to our table. We even cash tipped him individually because he was awesome. Thank you, Ron! Our waitress, who looked wasted, even watched him bust his hump as he did her job.

Nancy P.,"Chicago, IL",84,39,64,1.0,9/13/2015,"Happened to be seated by the kitchen window tonight. I will never return. Out of five cooks in the kitchen, only one wore gloves. Two were eating over the food they were cooking. One continued to wipe his nose and keep cooking. One repeatedly threw fries at other staff. The waitresses were at their service bar eating over the sauces they were dishing up. I watched one waitress cash out a customer who paid cash, clear a table, put her hands on the back of a customer and then went behind the counter and took shredded cheese from the bin WITH HER BARE HAND and sprinkled it on two salad plates. She then served them to customers. The manager was standing beside these people and never said a word. Never again!!! Someone from Red Robin did write and apologized. She sent me a $20 gift card. That wS enough to get me back to the chain again but not the Skokie store.  Three of us ate dinner tonight and two out of three were disappointed. The fried fish was probably slightly frozen when fried, which caused a textural issue and made the coating fall off. The batter was soggy and the liquid from the fish had run into the basket and soaked the fries.  My Banzai dinner salad was written up on the menu as having fresh grilled pineapple, mandarin oranges, almonds, greens, and chicken. The pineapple was canned and fried which was disappointing. The greens included beet greens which have such a strong flavor by themselves and they didn't blend with the other flavors. The salad came with ""garlic bread"" but it was closer to a large Garlic crouton soaked in butter.  Not my favorite meal.  My daughter ordered the Royal Red Burger and she was delighted. It was cooked as ordered and very tasty.  The service was delightful, friendly, attentive, and most enjoyable. Thank you Travis!

When I asked the host why were the other people seated before us she said that the 21+ area was full and the ""family"" area was freeing up which I think it's a bunch of BS since she wasn't asking anyone's age nor did she asked if we had a preference as of where to be seated; she just took names and called names.

By the time we sat down was still a decent crowd. My buddy ordered the spinach artichoke dip. Always a favorite, right? It would have been good if they gave us enough chips. Seriously it was about a handful of chips. The waiter said he'd come back with more but by the time the chips came the dip had cooled down. Kind of annoyed by that. Strike 1.  We ordered everything at once and by the time we received the appetizer it was pretty empty in the dining room. So we'd probably get our food quickly, right? Wrong!  At other locations during busy times, food would come out in like 10 minutes. It was probably closer to 25 minutes. And we would have asked our waiter but he was nowhere to be found during that time. Strike 2.  Instead of bottomless fries I wanted the broccoli with my French dip meal. Did I get broccoli? Nope. Gave me fries and had to wait for him to bring the broccoli. Strike 3.  Since it took so long to get the food it was practically cold by the time I ate it. Strike 4.  When we asked for a refill of one of the freckled lemonade it basically tasted like water with strawberries in it. Had to ask for another one. Strike 5.  Bad service. Bad service. Bad service.

I had worked as a server in college and I understand that customers get frustrating, but this was a new low. This is especially disappointing because this was not a student.

Had they decided to seat people at those tables, they would not have had a waiting list. Very strange. After being seated, the service is slow, slow, slow... Slow to get the drinks, slow to take our order, really slow with getting our food. Our waitress was doing her best, but she was clearly overwhelmed. They must not have appropriate staffing.

They have good hamburgers and sandwiches but their perk is bottomless steak fries. I ordered the California Chicken sandwich and really should only have eaten 1/2 of it. It was very tasty and the chicken very tender and I love guac on anything so it was a good choice.  They have their signature Red Robin spice at all the tables and it goes great with their fries.  They have a decent selection of beers and wines and I like how they have a TV on the floor to view while waiting for a table. Service was good and all of them very friendly.

Last night (Tuesday) 3 of us all over 21 decided to stop in for dinner.  The host tells us 10-15 minutes wait.  No problem for us.  There were 2 families waiting before us.  We sat at the bench and noticed that from the door we could see about 4 empty tables on the family side so we were really confused as to why he had the families waiting.  He got them seated and then took us back to the bar side.  There were at least 7 tables open and no one had walked out while we were waiting.  If all those tables were open why was it necessary to make us wait the 10 minutes.  I really don't understand this logic. We got to our table and I noticed there was only one waitress working on the bar side.  It took a while for her to come to our table, we were actually just about to get up and leave because we had such a bad taste in our mouth about them making us wait for no reason.  We put our order in and had no issues with the waitress she was nice but why was she the only one?  She brought out our silverware which looked disgusting!

The staff was friendly.  The manager greeted us at the door, and check on us in the middle of our meal.  The waiter was friendly and efficient, and refilled our water, and steak fries quickly. The food was alright.  I didn't have very much time to decide what to eat (since one friend started to order).  So I skimmed the menu very quickly.  I ordered the chicken ensenada.  I think the chicken was really really good.  However there really wasn't that much food on the ""platter"".  It is partially my own fault since I ordered 1 chicken breast instead of 2 and did not read the description.  But the platter consisted of the chicken, and a fistful size salad, and 3 kinds of sauces.  If I made this at home I would have had rice, or a vegetable, or something else to take up the other third of the plate.  Sauces should not replace food on my plate. The guys I was with ordered burgers, and they looked okay.  A bit small for $10, but they do come with unlimited fries.  Refills on fries are a terrible idea in my opinion.  But they probably make people happy and cause less waste, so I guess it works.  The fries were kinda bland though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=120

We went when it was pretty empty but still, we were given no napkins (we had to ask for them).

From my fork and knife,  to my appetizer plate, even my cup was disgustingly dirty. I had to ask for everything new.  Well, I FIRST ordered the Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger cause it looked yummy on the menu. However, when I bit into it, the meat had a funny taste to it. So I asked if I could change  my order to a Crispy Chicken Sandwich. Can't go wrong with chicken right....WRONG! It was oily, over cooked and bun was burned. I was hungry so I tried to eat it but I could only eat half. It was so bad! All I can say is before I went in, I was feeling great. When I left not so great.... I was in the bathroom all night throwing up and with the runs. This has been the worst thing that has ever happened to me from eating at a restaurant. And to make matters worse, my total was $57.03!

One more thing I noticed, other than milkshakes, they only have like 3 dessert choices??  What's up with that?  I gave up chocolate for lent so that left me with 1 choice.  So we skipped dessert.  hmmmm, not good.

Dennis D.,"Lincolnwood, IL",1,12,,2.0,5/6/2015,Really. The burgers here are varied and quite good. You get endless fries or veggies or fruit with most burgers.    This location  is clean and well kept up but the seating area outside of the bar area does not give you a feeling of being in a decent restaurant. Feels more like Denny's in the dining room areas.     I would have rated this location higher because the service is very good from the waitresses and bartender but the staff at the front desk is downright rude. Instead of being welcoming to people they act like antagonists. This isn't just one incident nor is  it just our personal opinion. Others were also grumbling at the many times we have visited.     I don't know where their training and manners came from but it wasn't Emily Post or Dear Abbey.     Too bad because the food is decent and the options are many. There are different size burgers and chicken dishes too.     How do the burgers stack up with other places? A little better than some well known burger emporiums but the fall short of the best ones. That said. The prices are reasonable and the bill won't kill you. It's comfortable and really family friendly.     Ask for more fries at anytime. The good waitresses will start you off with some fries. Thick cut steak fries properly done.     They also have  some bottomless drinks like root beer floats.     It is recommended by me if you sit in bar area and can avoid the combat onslaught at the front door. You will like the food.   I added this tag because now they have automated reorder machines on the table where you order from or call the waiter. So much for personal service.  This isn't a drive through fast food place. This makes the service more inattentive than before. With this new feature you do not feel cared for or even wanted.

Too bad I had asked for things that never even made it to our table, like a refill on the ""bottomless"" fries. I have had plenty of great experiences here but this was enough to deter me from coming back. I also had a severely upset stomach from the burger.

Corin A.,"Glencoe, IL",26,7,3,4.0,11/19/2015,First time at this location. Best experience so far! Food was delicious and prepared as requested. Service was quick and friendly and perfect timing for occasion. Smiles from the second we walked in. Travis (our server) was amazing! Friendly during entire visit. Noticed we needed refills without having to be asked! He even gave us 2 orders of refilled fries! Super helpful with figuring out the menu.

Marge F.,"Chicago, IL",4,10,,3.0,9/29/2015,"Well, the food is decent and the endless fries are great... So not bad if you want a beer and a burger.  What I didn't like ( and this may be the new trend or future) is the tablet on the table... At first I thought it was a neat interesting form of entertainment while your haging out.  Little did I know that they want YOU to do all the work for the waitress... From ordering food, drinks and then pay your check on it... Oh and pay the tip for a waitress that basically doesn't have to do much but show us how to pay and swipe on the thing... And beware... I played one of the trivia games on the tablet and it charged  1.99 on the bill for the app!!! I would't pay it and she had to get the manager to take it of the bill...

Well, we must have been on a roll because we had an equally lousy meal. The sticky menu did nothing to set a positive tone, nor did the screaming child, but I was still willing to give it a shot. Christopher liked the cole slaw that came with his disappointing burger. I liked the glass my margarita came in. The margarita itself was ok, but nothing special. I had a cup of French onion soup that was tasteless. I also had their riblet appetizer which was awful. I got a side of broccoli with it instead of fries. It was totally unseasoned rabbit food. We will not be back again.

Amanda J.,"Chicago, IL",21,35,,1.0,7/16/2013,"This restaurant is a disappointment. The food was mediocre, but the service wasn't exactly par to Red Robins in other states or towns. I'm also trying to figure out if our server was passive-aggressively racist. My friend and I got out of a movie, and she likes fries so I thought ""endless bottom refills"" would be great. I typically like Red Robin when tried in other states, but the restaurant chain was new to her. The server only talked to my friend when taking her order. After that, she blatantly only talked to me, or actually waited to talk to my friend when her mouth was completely full as if to make her look dumb or socially awkward. I actually asked, ""Would you like to talk to her? She's sitting right there,"" in a calm, personable voice when the server was asking me about her food before my friend had taken a bite and long before she finally turned to ask. The server completely ignored us while nearing the end of everyone else in her section being cleared.  That wasn't the biggest thing noticed, though. I'm Caucasian and my friend is African American. Neither of us drink alcohol, and I wondered if that was the issue. We were sitting in the bar area (faster time for being seated), waiting for service while a table within a foot of us with two Asian American gentlemen who were seated after us got waited on faster and finished first, leaving first, with the same or more food.  At first, the server was almost in our faces every two seconds asking how the food was when we hadn't had a chance to take a bite yet. My friend's food was cold and they got her order wrong twice. The first time, I thought that maybe they tried correcting it, but there were other issues that made her unhappy like the food not being what I should be, and then items that looked like they were leftover from other people's orders. I wasn't sure what was happening, but afterward my friend pointed out that every non-""white"" person she served (and yes, there were plenty in the section), she took a long time doing it while the white tables changed out rapidly and received food earlier.  I have friends of every nationality and ethnicity and haven't seen this before moving to Chicago although I've lived around the country. Was the server treating us oddly because my friend is African American or because she was wearing a scarf on her head? No one should ever be treated badly or with less than superior service anywhere they go no matter what they look like, etc. Unacceptable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=80
Jackie B.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,12/7/2014,"Absolutely awful !! A complete waste of money. My mushroom swiss cheeseburger was so greasy and slimy that the bun completely fell apart. My son's grilled cheese was dry as a bone-- two giant pieces of stale, toasted bread with a tiny piece of dried out cheese in the center. I told our waitress that the food was virtually inedible. This was met with a blank smile and the priceless suggestion ""Want more fries ?""  Um...noooo... The bill for an adult and a child came to about 20 dollars--for food we couldn't eat.  Though we were extremely disappointed ( I am a single parent so we treat ourselves to a sit down restaurant maybe once a month) we at least got a good laugh at the whole fiasco and a new category when we play ""Would you rather"" Save your money and get a good meal much more reasonably at any number of local restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=80

Alex M.,"Chicago, IL",1,28,,2.0,7/10/2014,"I generally like and go to this Red Robin because it was better than the one at the Hip. I like it because they typically seperated the adult couples with the teenages and families. This being said, they need to train their hostess' better.  I went there last week at around 7pm during a weekday. They had a few but not alot of customers. There was no one standing in line. I don't think this is their closing time. The hostess greeted my wife and I, and sat us next to 4 teenage girls and walked away. The family section was open with a few groups. Plenty of space everywhere. I am guessing the adult section was full and this why we were placed in the family section. I asked to be reseated so she sat us next to the changing/dish station. Was this out of spite? I asked to be reseated again. She gave me this attitude like ""just sit, I've got things to get done.""  Restaurants need to understand that we dont care which server is next in line for customers. We dont care that you are trying to close a section for the night. 7pm is not late. The cleaning/ dish station, the seat by the kitchen door, next to spoiled brats, and by the restrooms are the last locations an adult couple would like to be seated. So unless the place is packed, don't sit us there. The preference is not yours, but should be the customers. If there are seats open, please seat us in the booth on the big wall. The food and server were good but the attitude of the hostess spoiled everything.

Dude. Red Robin is overrated than a mo-fo. Talk about a letdown.  The hostess was efficient. The waiter friendly. There weren't kids running around screaming like I had feared.

The taking out of the arcade game also very much disapointed my son who had been looking forward to it all day. The service has slowed to a snails pace with things being brough out in random order. One appitizer brought out before simple drinks. Meals being brought out before the other 2 appiztizers, having to flag someone down for refills, servers you had to ask multiple times for simple things. I'm a reasonable person if the place had been packed I'd of over looked this and said well there busy but they weren't. Our side of the restaurant was practically empty. Only a few other tables. Now granted I couldn't see the other side but it didn't seem like they were swamped by any means. But now lets get to the thing that coujld have turned it around the food. Sad to say it didn't. The food like the service and the atmosphere has gone down hill. Maybe the kitchen was just having a bad night I don't know. My chili had no flaver and was like meat with water in it, my husbands soup  was watery, and our burgers were just greezy and disgusting no flaver and just weren't appealing at all.

Kids menu with crayons and puzzles, pictures of the food to help them order and $3.99 for parmesan noodles, a side AND bottomless chocolate milk? Holy cow!  I got their mac n cheese which comes with some kind of garlic bread and a side salad. The salad was good for a chain resturant and the mac n cheese was delish. It was ALMOST too cheesy, so I would probably only get it if I was very hungry. They also have the option to substitute a veggie or vegan patty for any burger. Nice! I love veggie firendly places!  Our waitress was extremely friendly, and the owner was checking tables to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal.

We were pleasantly surprise that it was a sit down joint.  My husband and I got a little nervous because we had a McDonald type budget  so we didn't know what to expect price wise. We asked to sit in a booth, the waitress was nice but she stationed us right by where the waiters go in and out to serve. Note, there was a bunch of empty booths in more desirable areas.

Not the best quality though - just a bit better than a fast food burger - but def more expensive.  Still, lots of variety and some sandwiches, like their grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, is tasty. They also offer other healthier options like their turkey burger, natural burger, and garden burger.  Haven't tried yet but i do appreciate the choice. Apps are decent.

G R.,"Chicago, IL",334,776,935,3.0,4/24/2009,"I had to look  to the Yelp stars for guidance on this one. I really was stuck between had better and A-OK. Because I've had better, however this was A-OK. Say what? Well I'll give this a go: Greeting- Fast and friendly, however the hostess tried to seat at at the worst table, the one right up in front to the left, the one that is right next to the hostess station and everyone coming/going. Many other tables available, this is just a pet peeve of mine. Waiter- A quick hello, then it was a hello where did that guy go, we need to order. I was out with a friend on a lunch hour. Ordering- Damn, I can't get my burger medium RARE, the waiter says can get some pink, I deliberate while friend orders. Well okay I guess, I'll try it, since I've been trying to limit eating out and I really want a burger. Food- Not bad, some pink. Meh, what can you do it's their policy and they did tell me upfront, so I can't blame them there, not like other places that say okay medium rare and comeback with something that looks like a lump of coal between the bun. Ah the bun, it fell apart nothing like ketchup getting underneath your finger nails, it was a mess. They must be buying the buns from the same place that the Sox are getting theirs from. Waiter redemption- When he checked back with us and wanted to see if we needed anything else, we explained the time crunch. He delivered the check stat and brought back my credit card right away. Cost- Yes, I usually don't charge lunch, I think this place is a bit, just a bit pricey. I could see this adding up real quick for a family. Overall probably won't seek this place out, but if in the area and hungry well okay. It's a chain, and I generally don't like places like this, but that's certainly not their  fault. If I used that as a decision then we'd be at one star and I don't think that would be fair.

She was actually at the table next to us chatting with a lone patron for over 15-minutes.  We waited 40-minutes for our orders in a not so busy restaurant. I ordered chicken fajitas and they arrived luke warm. Our meal was interupted four times by waitstaff loudly clapping and singing a happy birthday at various tables. Kermudgeon I'm not--this was overkill. The restaurant is extremely loud with no soft surfaces to absorb noise. It's difficult to carry a conversation, even at close range.

My friend that got the burger was sorely disatisfied too.  The company in the restaurant was somewhat confusing, screaming children mixed with an old-timer hick dive-bar crowd....

The hostess struggled with the reality that the first few tables they selected for us, after we'd waited for 30 minutes for a table and they'd already called us, wouldn't work with a sling for the infant carrier we had with us.  Eventually they got that working, but I've knocked two stars off for the wait and the lack of tables to work with an infant carrier.

Chris W.,"Chicago, IL",347,512,42,3.0,4/24/2009,"Our first experience at this Red Robin was AWESOME. (Our server was a younger high school aged kid who was SO on top of taking care of us and he even stopped to chat a couple times and we tipped him real well for the experience, as well as his good recommendations on the burgers. The bayou burger and bonsai burgers are the best there I've had so far. The mushroom and swiss burger is loaded with mushrooms but that's about all that's memorable about it...Mush and Swiss I got the second time around by the way...) So then a couple days ago we were back, we had a waitress this time who hardly checked in on us, gave us 2 napkins after we were practically done eating, did not bring us fries outside of what came with our burger and did not let us know that they WERE bottomless fries. However, she did re-fill my strawberry lemonades (so good) as I finished them and got us our check in a timely manner. What else was kind of a slap in the face was that it wasn't busy at all. I've worked in the restaraunt buisness and I've seen better service even on busy nights...anyways. There was no real awesome customer service and had we had this experience the first time we went I can almost assure you that we wouldn't be interested in coming back :(.

With that said... this location has only been open a few months and you can tell.  The food is good (well, at least, the burgers and fries since that's all I've tried), but the service still needs to improve.  I haven't necessarily received bad service; however, I wouldn't rate it highly either.  The first time I went the server was really good (and cute too), but it took a while to get our bill at the end.  The second time our server just had her own personality (maybe one that doesn't necessarily click with mine).  I felt rushed even though it took a while to get our order.  Plus, my shake was milky (aka runny aka watery)... and that's a big no-no for me.  Shakes MUST be THICK!  Otherwise, I would order chocolate milk! Anyhow, I definitely plan on going back.  I'm just hoping they work out a few kinks by then and that service gets a little better.  Oh... and that the shakes get thicker.

After seeing the line out the door, we asked to sit at the bar so we could just order takeout. My man and I were perplexed as to why anyone would wait for an hour just to get a table at a chain burger joint.  The service was mediocre at best, and there seemed to be a ""twice"" theme going on -- they asked us to order twice (already ordered...) to pay twice (I already paid...), and then brought our food out twice - once on a plate and then again in a to-go box.

Doe L.,"Chicago, IL",64,173,193,3.0,2/10/2009,"As soon as we drove by, my friend yelled, ""RED ROBIN!!""  The jingle came up and we decided to eat there after our movie right around the corner. The decor is cheesy (as other people have mentioned).  But it kind of reminds you of high school days.  ""Random"" would be the term I would use to define this place.  Very lively for a family dinner with the kids yet there's still a bar in the middle of the place... (although you're restricted to a max of three alcoholic drinks per person... it IS a family restaurant people!) If that wasn't random enough for you, how about the constant jumps between the hitlist songs right now and then back to random 80s and 90s? The service was probably the worst part.  She disappeared on us for a while... and then it took at least half an hour for her to finally put our order in.  Perhaps it was the fact that she came back every 5 minutes to tell us of a new item that the kitchen has ""run out"" of...  Of course I don't blame her for the kitchen running out of things but I'd prefer that she found ALL of them and THEN asked for our changes. The burgers came out and since I've never been to a Red Robin before, I had no clue if I got the right one.  It lacked the guacamole that was the main reason I chose that particular burger so I had to ask for it.  It was really good though.  Afterwards, my friends and I realized that our burgers had been switched... so apparently I ate a Blackened Burger instead of the Santa Fe. Since the burger was still delicious, plus bottomless garlic parmesan fries (make sure you ask for the garlic parmesan or you'll get regular for burgers) and you can get a bottomless strawberry lemonade... the experience was still very yummy.  Service needs to be improved though.

They had movie posters, Rock and roll memorabilia and a homoerotic Andy Warhol poster all on the same wall.  The food was good, but quite over priced. I really can't justify $9.00 for a burger. We also split a onion ring appetizer that was $7.00.  They do have a wide variety of different burgers to suit just about any palliate, but none of them are worth the $8.00 to $10.00 price tag.  It was also a very weird crowd demographic. It was a mix between a bar crowd and Chucky Cheese. They serve beer, so I thought that it would be an more adult crowd. But there were kids there having birthday parties. They also did the annoying birthday singing that Bennigan's started.  I have heard good things about Red Robin, and I'm""m glad that I gave it a try, but it's just not my cup of tea.

Gayle R.,"Forest Park, IL",0,20,,1.0,2/17/2012,"My daughter and I went to Red Robin last Sunday, we just had to have a burger!!!  Our previous experience at this restaurant was a rude and inattentive waiter, but we decided to give it another try.  We walked in just after they opened, we were the first people seated on the restaurant side of the restaurant.  Our waitress came she was nice, friendly attentive (unlike last time) we received our drinks, and placed our order.  While waiting for our food, a single lady came in and was seated 2 booths over, and then a few minutes later and the family with 4 children under the age of 5 came in.  Can you guess where they seated them???  If you guessed RIGHT ACROSS THE AISLE FROM US, you are correct!!!!!!  There must be at least 20-25 other tables, and the hostess insisted on seating them across the aisle from us, even when the Mom asked to be seated near the windows the hostess said here would be fine.  Now I do not blame the parents, nor the kids, for being kids, I blame the hostess and the management.  Within 3 minutes the kids started screaming, and shrieking.  I got up walked toward the kitchen area and asked the gentleman there if he was the manager.  He indicated he was, I explained the situation, and he said he would talk with the hostess.  When I went to sit down the shrieks were continuing and we grabbed our coats and left.   When I got home I emailed the customer service department about our experience, and received 2 phone calls this week from management, which proceeded to eat my voice mail.  Today I got an email from the Customer Service Manager stating the management was trying to contact me, I feel at this point WHY BOTHER???  There is nothing they can do or say at this point that would change my mind about ever going near the restaurant in this lifetime. To say this was a dismal experience would be an understatement.  Does it not occur to businesses that sometimes adults want to eat a meal in peace and quiet without kids screaming in their ears?    I can see at 3:00 in the afternoon, but at 11AM on a Sunday?  We go at that time TO AVOID THE KIDS CHAOS!

Andy C.,"Cary, NC",84,413,913,3.0,7/19/2009,"Perfectly middle of the road experience, balanced at the ends by some high points and some points that I would consider to be less than stellar. Objectively: A) The location isn't too bad for either north suburbanites or people who live in the city.  On a Sunday afternoon, it took roughly 30 minutes to get there from the loop via 90/94.  Return trip was about 25 due to less traffic.  Touhy West, take a left at Carpenter, and it's in that little area by BW3 and the movie theater. B) The decor is something that sort of makes you scratch your head.  Upon walking in, you'll notice the following things in no particular order: little crane and arcade games where you can win a prize by lining up moving lines; the lcd tv in the floor; the balloons hanging from the ceiling; the oddly shaped and oddly colored lighting.  The LCD screen in the floor isn't a bad touch especially if there is a wait, but something about the brightly colored conical cylinder lamp coverings sort of screamed ""cheap circus.""   C) This type of establishment attracts a lot of different people, which means that it has more than just limited appeal.  While eating, I noticed couples that were in their 20's and 30's, families replete with parents, grandparents, and grandkids, older couples (AARP style), and local tweens/teens/late teens.   D) Layout of the restaurant is spacious.  No problems getting back and forth, which is always a plus.   Subjectively: A) Service was attentive and fast, at least from the server that I had.  Quick to bring drinks and food, and also the check.  Not necessarily a bad thing that he brought the check fast, and he did preface by saying, ""No hurry.""  Personally, I don't mind this type of behavior, but some people may take umbrage to it.  Suck it up.   B) The menu selection is based off of ""the world's best burger.""  WRONG ANSWER.  A burger consists of the following key items: the bread and the meat.  The bread here was ok.  Not great, not bad.  The meat?  They claim that it's ""fresh"" and ""cooked to order.""  You know who else claims that?  Wendy's.  Sure, I had a non-specialty burger.  I wanted a double cheeseburger, no lettuce.  In no particular order, these are the places that make a better double cheeseburger: Chili's, Portillo's, Poag Mahone's, Bar Louie, and Beer Bistro.  My personal stance is that if you can't make a basic burger to an exceptional quality, you can't make a specialty burger to an exceptional quality.  It's not a bad burger, but it's just not great.  Perfectly average, I would say.  But who knows - their other items may be much better.  They do offer chicken sandwiches and other types of entrees, so I would be willing to go back and give those a try. C) A second cornerstone of Red Robin's appeal is their ""bottomless fries.""  I didn't even want to finish my first order of fries.  Yes, they were thick steak cut fries, and I enjoy those.  But it was clear after eating one or two that that the frying temperature was not high enough and the seasoning was not well defined enough.  The seasoning available at the tables is fairly decent, however.  Unfortunately, the sogginess and paper mache texture of my bottomless fries was a definite turn off.   Overall Ratings: Location: 4 out of 5 Service: 4 out of 5 Decor: 3 out of 5 Atmosphere: 3 out of 5 Food: 2 out of 5 Hype matching expectations: 2 out of 5 Overall: 3 out of 5.   I would be willing to give Red Robin another shot, maybe just with a different (non burger) offering next time.  For now, Chili's, Outback, or Chipotle just down the street would be viable alternatives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=200
