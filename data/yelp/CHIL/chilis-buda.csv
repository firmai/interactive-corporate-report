Gustavo C.,"Austin, TX",127,81,393,3.0,11/10/2016,"Have visited this location a couple of times. Have received good and bad service as well as good and not so good food quality. Food: Have visited on different occasions. The food quality is a hit or miss. Have received overcooked food and on other visits good quality. What is unusual is that the restaurant is usually not busy during the times that we visited, so I am not sure about what the reason behind the quality is. Good restaurant for appetizers during happy hour with their free chips and salsa. Drinks: Drinks are of good tasteful quality. I opt for El Nino because of amount served, and quality of flavor and liquor strength. Other margaritas are good as well. Service: Service can be hit or miss. In one visit, it took a while to be seated even though the restaurant was almost empty. Servers may take longer than usual to come back and check up on the table. On other visits, our server was attentive and checked up on us often. Mostly hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda

Shannon V.,"Buda, TX",3,165,13,4.0,7/7/2017,Still love this place :) we always sit at the bar- Caleb has been our bartender last several times and he is always staying on top of everything- makes sure we have drinks and the food comes out quickly- usually eat the margarita chicken or the spicy chicken breast plate and its always juicy and delicious.

JoAnn K.,"Kyle, TX",21,32,24,4.0,1/26/2016,"Usually I avoid chain restaurants but today I was in the mood to try out my local Chili's for lunch. I didn't expect much because... Well, you know...  However, I ordered the New 10 oz. Char-crusted sirloin when I saw that it was on a bed of asparagus (my favorite!) And I don't regret my decision! Try on this description... ""100% USDA choice 10 oz. Sirloin with ancho-garlic rub & chopped green onions, served on a bed of grilled asparagus & garlic roasted tomatoes with a side of homestyle fries. Served with a side of smoky pasilla-honey Chile sauce.""  I didn't really like the sauce which isn't surprising since I'm not really a BBQ sauce person, but the steak was SO GOOD (medium-rare) that it would have been a shame to put a sauce on it. The asparagus was also good. The fries would have between delicious any other time, but nothing could compare with that awesome steak!   The staff was friendly, efficient and made the original recommendation, for which I am grateful. I also like their tabletop order kiosk system. I like to be pleasantly surprised and today's experience was just that. I will be back for one of their delicious looking desserts sometime when I'm not so stuffed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda

Andrew G.,"Houston, TX",0,16,3,1.0,1/2/2017,"So here we are again! The wife asked for a salad and the closest one to us is the one I vowed never to go back to. I placed an online order for 2 salads with some extra items added and a spinach dip with chips. Thinking to myself do I place the order for another store and make the drive or just take my chances with the store I've had problems with in the past? Well as you guessed it pick the store that less than a mile from me! This time it's shame on me because I should have driven to another location that I trust as it happened again. Please tell me what is so difficult about making a customer happy? To keep this short, I was missing paid for items on one salad and what I asked for as extra was not visible to any of our 6 eyes. I say that because I wear glasses! I have to say we have been ordering our salads from The Texas Roadhouse and not 1 time have they made an error with our meal. As well the service we get there is fonominal.  Way to go for them! At this point I am going to contact someone in their corporate offices to file a complaint and get the message across on customer service. I am also in the field of customer service in another capacity however I will never let a customer of mine ever go away without what they have paid for or without excellent customer service. Don't get me wrong the young lady working the register and whom like she stated "" put our order together ""  did so with a smile and very polite just may need more training? Not her fault. The Manager needs to give them the tools to do their jobs with the idea , the customer is all ways right. Please understand the only reason I went there was to please my wife so that said, I'm sure I'll return to only be disappointed again! I don't claim to be the master of customer service but if you specialize in one craft you should better know more than how to punch some numbers in the back office. I have been on all sides of it including management so please don't punish me or my family anymore and create that wonderful experience everyone looks for when they crave your food!

beth s.,"Austin, TX",9,21,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Ugh, just don't. It looks so convenient, right after your trip to Cabela's! And honestly, if dirty tables that are never cleared for the entire duration of your visit doesn't turn you off, this might be your place. If you don't mind waiting ten minutes for a server before you walk to the host stand and wait for someone to acknowledge you before you request a server, this is a may be a hot spot just for you.  I don't mind long wait times for food as much as I mind looking at other hungry guests who have been waiting even longer than I have. As a former server, this gives me anxiety. And generally makes me feel sad for the inconvenience others are facing - particularly when they are elderly or have small children. Which is everyone in Buda. Service was not terrible - not great. But who cares when you spend your entire visit kicking yourself for walking in? Food? Meh. It's Chilis. This place is badly managed. Or not managed. I can't get over how dirty it was. As a server, at every restaurant I worked at (over 16 years), managers would remind us, ""Never leave the floor without something in your hand."" In other words, clear tables, whether yours or not, constantly. I didn't see a single server bother to pretend to attempt any variation of this. Don't they have corporate training? No? Something? It's a bad scene, don't be a part of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda
Melaine O.,"Austin, TX",23,74,17,1.0,12/17/2015,"3 PM - on a weekday.  Thought it would be nice to stop in and grab a bite to eat after spending a few hours at Cabela's.  Waited about 5 min before being acknowledged. Hostess was a very tall female - unsure of name, but I am sure that she wasn't interested in providing service. No greeting after long wait time. We didn't mind the short wait, but a smile would have been nice - or at least a 'Hello'.  We did explain to the hostess that we needed to sit by the windows - because we wanted to be able to see our car.  She said something along the lines of "" well OK, but it's going to be a few minutes cause she's really busy"". We told her that we didn't mind the wait - as we just wanted to be able to see our car. And we weren't terribly concerned about it ""taking too long"" since we could see that only 3 tables were occupied.  she proceeded to sit at an interior table with absolutely no view of the parking lot.  We again said that we wanted to be able to sit by a window because we had valuables in our car and wanted a clear line of site - she 'huffed' and said ""there is only one person working this section"".   I turned to my husband and said ""ok, let's go"". We walked out.  There was no valid reason she could not sit us where we could see the parking lot & frankly I don't have time for that kind of lack of service. Someone needs re-training. Or a new job that doesn't involve customer service.  Strike one - wait time without acknowledgment Strike two - obvious bad attitude and lack of any cheer after finally being greeted.  Strike three - refusing to listen or care enough to accommodate a very simple request.  Bye Felicia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda
Rusty S.,"Ponder, TX",6,22,11,3.0,11/24/2015,Wait staff was very attentive. A+ there. Cajun Chicken Pasta. My signature dish. Salty tonight. Garlic bread a little over toasted.  Other than those comments. Very tasty!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda
Dave F.,"Austin, TX",7,11,,2.0,10/21/2015,"Don't like the feel/vibe of this place. I go to Logan's and Texas Roadhouse plus numerous other ""local"" establishments all the time but tonight running late so had to go here. Been in here before but sat at the tables (not the bar). Overall is ""Corporate"" national chain and they like Trashelbees (Applebees) trying so hard to cut costs every way possible. Most noticeable is in their beer pours. Use to be just a dime size below the top but now a Quarter or more. So I accepted the first time but when came to second beer after ordering $25+ in food alone was given this stupid bambi in the headlights look by the big Amazon bartender. Also given the same look when I was just new into my first beer and saw the keg run out realizing the beer kinda flat.  Then the food not so great. Steak overall Ok but easily 30% of the 10 Oz. for $17 grisly or fat. Fries had some weird kinda taste too, not so much an old oil taste but something else unlike ANY OTHER fries I had in a long time. The the salad with enough wilted leafs to only be able to eat half at most. Morale of the story: Visit only your local chains and drive these greedy chain restaurants with fat bloated Corporate overhead draining the local stores out of business.

Kacy W.,"Austin, TX",1,8,,1.0,2/13/2016,"Don't go to this place. This location is very dirty and nasty. I ordered food to go and when I went in the store to pay for the food, my friend was able to see into the kitchen based on where I had parked and saw employees eating off plates with their bare hands!! Gross. Then I ordered another dish a second time and had hair in my food. I complained to the manager & he didn't care.. I wouldn't do here unless you are okay eating dirty, nasty food. Horrible place. Should be closed. Go to Zaxby's instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda
Lauren S.,"Buda, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/20/2015,"If I could give this restaurant negative stars, I would. I have never had such terrible service as I have at this place. I've been there 2 times, and once ordered food to go.  The first time, the food took over 40 minutes to get to the table. Once it arrived, I noticed that the top bun on my sandwich was cold and hard as a rock. I told my server once she finally came back around (I'd say ehh close to 10 minutes later), and instead of grabbing my plate to take it to the back, she grabbed the bun off of my sandwich with her bare hands and took it to the back to get a new one. I don't know about you guys, but I love eating food that hasn't had my server's hands all over it. It took over 5 minutes for her to bring me a new one and by that time I had lost my appetite.  The second time I went there, it was a little later and there were three tables in the rant. It took a close to 30 minutes for the food to come out and once again it was cold. By that time, I just didn't even care anymore because I thought it was my fault for coming back.  Months later, I decided to order food to go. Now I know if you order food to go, you stand a risk of it not being as hot as you'd like, but I live less than five minutes away, and my fries felt like they hadn't let them thaw out from being in the freezer. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, and they didn't even make it right. I ordered sides of ranch and honey mustard and none of that was in my bag to go. I work in the service industry so I'm completely understanding of the business...IT'S NOT THAT HARD!  I am so frustrated with everything about this restaurant, I will not be returning. Chilis has lost my business for good. And if you were smart, you'd stay away from Chilis too, or at least this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda

That means our order was probably sitting on the counter for a while, which makes sense because they took forever to give us our food. They weren't really that busy today, I've seen them worse.  The waiter was very apologetic, and was pretty attentive otherwise. He did work to make it right for us, comped us the child meal and our drinks after bringing out our remade food.   As far as taste goes, once we got our reheated food, the crispy shrimp tacos were pretty good, did not even have to add salsa to them and got the sweet potato fries on the side which we're good as well.

James F.,"Driftwood, TX",413,721,1800,2.0,1/13/2010,"Count this one under there were no viable food options in the area; plus my pregnant cousin wanted to go there. So, its Chili's. The one place that Bourdain pointed out as the enemy on his US/Mexico border episode.  Service was adequate but it lost momentum right away after the hostess seated us in an elevated booth with a baby in my arms. Little Rooster is tall; I opted for a rare booster seat so he wouldn't be picking the gum off the underside of the table. Minus some common sense here don't you think? My Taco Trio was uneventful. Crappy rice, beans, pulled pork with Shiner Bock BBQ sauce; and a minimal score for the shrimp tacos. The Chips, Salsa, and queso were the only highlight if there was one. I honestly didn't detect the usual hint of vinegar in the salsa which I normally cringe over. Cousin's meal was a ""eatin for the baby"" experience. Everything tastes good when your knocked up! Would I recommend you drop everything your doing and run down here? The answer would be an enthusiastic no. The enemy did its best to impress. It might have won me over if I ordered the Mushroom Jack Beef Fajitas. Here is my advice for you folks in Buda; go to Austin and try something that is not a chain.

Sylvia K.,"Kyle, TX",0,7,,1.0,1/3/2016,"On New Year's Day my daughter and I went to Chili's in Buda, TX.  What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  First we were seated behind two booths that were filthy - food on the table and floor as well as spilled drinks puddling on the floor.  Those booths were left filthy and unattended for the duration of our meal (approx 1/2 hour).  After ordering, the waitress never came back to check on our table nor were we offered refills on our drinks while we waited for our meal.  Approximately half an hour after ordering the waitress came over to our table and told us that she had lost our ticket and asked us to tell her AGAIN what our order was.  I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager that appeared at our table was frumpy, frazzled and hyper and did not want to hear what the problem was, he merely told us to reorder our food and that he would ""pay for our lunch"".  He took a dirty wadded up napkin from his pocket (it looked like he'd used it to blow his nose!) and once again wrote our food order on it.  I tried explaining the problems we'd had with our waitress being rude, etc, aside from the fact that she lost our order; the manager was also rude and would not allow me to speak.  He acted as if though he did not want to be bothered!  Not more than five minutes after the manager left our table the waitress approached our table again and explained that she ""had not actually lost our order but had merely attached it to the wrong table"" (as if though that would make a difference!).  She had delivered our meal to the wrong table and when it was rejected by those patrons she had placed it under a heat lamp.  Once she figured out her mistake she brought it to our table so we never got a fresh meal.  The food had been left to sit under a warming lamp for more than half an hour and was no longer fresh or appetizing.  The final straw was when the waitress set down the old food she was also going to hand me the tab.  I advised her that we were not paying for the (old) food, and we stood up and left the restaurant.  The service was horrible and management was a joke.  Upon leaving Chili's there were quite a few customers standing by the door waiting to be seated; meanwhile inside the restaurant there were filthy floors and unoccupied tables sitting empty and left unattended by the cleaning staff.  That was strike three for us at Chili's (both Buda and San Marcos); I will never again patronize Chili's; their food is mediocre at best, the service has always been terrible and management leaves so much to be desired.  I give Chili's ZERO stars in my rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda?start=20

Oh- those cheese fries, btw, were supposed to be an appetizer but she brought them with the meal.

Dennis S.,"Kyle, TX",3,5,,3.0,5/27/2011,"Not too bad at beginning. Only had 15 min wait for arriving at 5:30pm on a Fri.  Once we were seated then the screaming kid attacks started!! Why do parents wait for ever to take screaming kids outside. Thank God for menu cuz waiter speaks so fast and low in a loud restaurant it makes it very hard to understand!!! Other than this food came out in good time and was pretty good! Just tired of Chili's probably will make another place our ""go to"" restaurant pretty soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda?start=40
Brittany W.,"Buda, TX",0,6,1,2.0,4/3/2014,"Well it's chili's. There isn't much more to say. The food is covered in grease and never cooked the way you ask. I ordered a burger, stressed the importance of it being well done and of course it was still red in the middle. When I asked if I could just get Chicken instead they said no problem which was nice. They brought me another burger, 20 minutes later after my husband had already finished eating his lunch, and it was made wrong again, but at least it was cooked all the way! I asked if I was getting charged for the burger I ordered, she said of course, so I said great, can I have the bacon and onion strings that I'm paying for since this just has lettuce and tomatoes? Other than that the waitress was great. You could tell she got annoyed and assumed that we weren't going to tip because we had a coupon and a gift card (the only reason I would eat there), but of course I still left a good tip. They need to work better on customer satisfaction and taking care of your guests. The food really won't change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-buda?start=40
