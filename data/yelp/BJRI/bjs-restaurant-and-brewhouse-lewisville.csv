Vinodh Kumar C.,"Irving, TX",183,116,359,4.0,12/23/2017,"This is the Lewisville outlet located right next to Costco and Best Buy. Reaching this spot by GPS is very easy. Parking might be tough because there are too many restaurants in the complex. As we went in, we had to wait for the table to be ready for quite sometime even though there were many empty tables. May be they were short on staff the other day. Once we got our table getting the order in was fast. This is a brewhouse which means we need to try out their beers. Harvest Heiffivusen is one of their beauty products. The range of alcoholic items are very good like other outlets. Even though they specialise in beers, their food options are also good. Please try the chicken potstickers. Dinner at BJ's is never complete without a PiZzooKie. The staffs are very professional and friendly but some of them are not too good at explaining their products.  The only and major drawback here is the price. Yup, make sure you have a FAT wallet if u planned to have a long dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville
Urvashi S.,"Nashville, TN",69,3,12,4.0,11/9/2017,"Went to this location first time. My four star review for this location here goes.  1. Ambience: very nice, relaxed environment with him lighting perfect for a nice dinner with family or date night. +1 star 2. Promptness of seating: slow very slow. I had to wait quiet some time in order to be seated so had to drop a star there. -1 star 3. Server: my server was Chris. He was prompt in taking my order as soon as I got seated helped me with the wine selection they had brought samples to try. Over all helpful and kept checking if I was doing ok +1 star 4. Food: Food arrived fairly quickly and was tasteful. I tried Bjs deep dish pizza. Try it if you like deep dish I am very happy I choose that food item. +1 star 5. Overall it was a great experience and my server drew a Thank you note on my check. Which was the last cherry on the top +1... =4",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville

Daniel T.,"Dallas, TX",8,46,41,4.0,10/7/2017,"First time going to BJ's. Overall, I had a good time here. The thing about BJ is that, they don't specialize in anything, so they have LOTS of options. A lot of different genres of foods to choose from.  1. I got the strawberry lemonade as my drink. Very refreshing. Get it on a hot day and you're set.  2. I end up getting the bone in pork chop. Absolute fantastic deal for the portion. They only serve the pork chop after 4PM!Comes with two sides. First side I chose was the chicken tortilla soup. Very delicious. I love that they add the avocado!  3. Pork Chop was decent. Not the best but still pretty good. This was mediocracy at its finest. Big size in my opinion so you can take it home. I chose roasted asparagus as me second side. Well done on the asparagus. Tasted amazing.  Ultimately, enjoyed the visit. Not anything to go crazy over but the variety of the foods served here makes this place a great place for groups. Great place to come if you're looking for a lot of options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville
Howard S.,"The Colony, TX",13,358,440,3.0,7/29/2017,"This is your typical BJ's restaurant. An extensive variety of good food, draft beers, creative cocktails, and a reasonable wine list. The highlight of the visit was our server, Robin. He was one of the best servers I have ever had at a BJ's. Very attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, it seemed to take a very long time for our food to arrive. I ordered the pork chop with sides steamed broccoli and brussels sprouts. Although the Porkchop was at a very acceptable temperature, both sides were lukewarm at best. All in all, A good experience for a BJ's restaurant.  As a member of their rewards club-it was very cool but I could pay for my meal through my phone and not have to wait for the server to take my credit card, run it, and bring it back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville
Ted A.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,143,58,3.0,7/22/2017,"An updated post for this location for a new dish, chicken fried hamburger.  According to our waiter, just added menu item, looked different, so gave it a shot  Its exactly what it says it us, a hamburger patty that has been lightly breaded and fried. Also the fried egg on top adds taste and a bit of a mess. Overall, not a bad burger, but honestly the fried  patty taste got lost in all of the other flavors. Its worth a try, just get a lot of napkins up front, and then keep asking for more napkins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville
Santanu S.,"Flower Mound, TX",15,144,75,3.0,6/2/2017,"If I could name reviews, I would call this ""The Case of the Secret Sides"". I heard about the new slow-roasted menu and wanted to try one of the items. Although it looked appealing, the prime rib would have been too much food with the addition of the soup or salad. The Double Bone-In Pork Chop did not come with an appetizer, so I chose that. I chose the rice pilaf and white cheddar mashed potatoes as my sides. The pork chop tasted great especially with the rub. It was neither over- nor undercooked. Before the first bite, I was a bit hesitant because there was no sauce or gravy. The rub made them unnecessary. As for the sides, I enjoyed the rice pilaf. I could have done without the mashed potatoes. Only if I had known there were more sides available. Unfortunately, the menu is designed terribly. The only sides listed on Page 1 were the standard ""Signature Sides"". Page 9 had both the standard sides and the ""Premium Sides"", such as, honey sriracha Brussels sprouts, turmeric-roasted cauliflower, Peruvian quinoa & brown rice blend, etc. I was correct in ordering the pork chop. As I barely touched the mashed potatoes, I had room for dessert. For a chocoholic, there was only one option... Triple Chocolate Made With Ghirardelli pizookie. Unlike other pan cookie desserts, this one was not too thick. As a result, with the two scoops of double chocolate chip ice cream, it was the right amount of dessert for one. Although, it did come with two spoons. Although there were plenty of tables, I decided to sit at the bar today. There were a few folks behind the bar and always someone within earshot. As a result, I never had problems getting service. I would have posted this review when I was still at the restaurant. At the time, their free wifi was useless. The firewall was misconfigured and would not allow access to legitimate site including  .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville
Connor B.,"Lewisville, TX",180,1,,1.0,12/26/2017,Be careful with what you tip here. They stole $20 dollars from me after I said pay half cash and half card they went ahead and charged the whole bill to my card and kept my $20 in cash anyways. Wasn't I mistaken tip either because I put it clearly on the bill that I would tip $7.50.

Robin W.,"Spicewood, TX",71,344,184,5.0,6/7/2017,Fantastic service and food.  We had the chips and queso as an appetizer and it came out at a reasonable time before the rest of the food. We had an order of avocado eggrolls as a meal and 3 burgers. One of the burgers had to be on a gluten free bun and it tasted very good.  The burgers came with fries and they are very generous with the amount of fries.    I was very happy to see a lot of gluten free options on the menu.  Highly recommend this place when you have a group.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville

Michael H.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",314,77,48,2.0,4/26/2017,"I really hate to leave bad reviews, but our experience here was just horrible, and it was by no means the first time. We went in at 5:30p on a Thursday when it was slower, so I thought we could get exceptional service (or at least decent) service.  We got seated immediately, however, we waited for about 20min with server after server passing us by (and no drinks at the table so we clearly haven't been helped) before I finally got up and went to the host stand in which they found someone to take over our table immediately. The 4 of us eventually ordered our drinks (a couple beers) and then a variety of food off the menu. 10-15 minutes after, still no beers but here come the food runners with our food, and boy am I thankful for the food runners so our food didn't get the lack of attention like everything else seemed to that evening. Giving BJ's 2 stars because food actually came out warm, in a timely manner, and tasted great.

Wonju R.,"Houston, TX",154,163,65,3.0,5/7/2016,"Upon arrival, the host was friendly and seated us within minutes. We were seated and received the menus. The waitress took our drink order and as we were looking over the menu, we realized the table was still dirty and sticky. They had cleared it but not wiped it completely. I had to wipe the table myself.  Moving on, we ordered our food. We got the jambalaya, deep dish ziti, shrimp penne and the chipotle glazed salmon.  The jambalaya was SALTY! I'm not sure if that was their intention or not but it was very salty. The flavor however was pretty good. The ziti had mild saltiness and was a bit oily, but other than that had a good flavor to it. The shrimp penne photo was misleading with the abundant amount of shrimp. We got maybe 5 pieces of shrimp. The glazed salmon was the best of all the order. It has great flavor and the sauce was perfect, not too empowering.  The waitress was very friendly and the atmosphere overall is pretty good. I would say for what we got the price is on the higher end. I would consider coming again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville
Godley V.,"Queens, NY",152,374,690,4.0,4/15/2016,"Packed house last Friday night so my party of 3 ponies up to the bar to watch the game while we waited and just ended up staying there and ordering our food right there. We ordered 2 pizza to share - a Spicy Hawaiian Chicken and a Great White. Both were tasty enough but can't compete with the legendary New York slices or Chicago deep dishes. The pizza crust was very bready, albeit not too dense or oily, and it housed the toppings very well.  The flavors were good but not intense. The bartender who took care of us was super friendly and chatted it up with us, even on this busy evening. He was eager to provide suggestions and offered a few beer samples to try out. They do have several house beers to try plus many well known faves on tap. We also split a dessert...the apparently famous (Chocolate Chunk) Pizookie. Being that we were all pretty full after the pizzas, sharing was the perfect solution. The Pizookie was pure chocolate goodness, basically a brownie topped w. chocolate ice cream. I love me some chocolate so I had no problem with getting the lion's share.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville
Samm S.,"Lewisville, TX",0,8,,1.0,4/28/2017,"I want to like this place. In fact when the food comes correctly, it's pretty good! However, that is IF it comes correctly. My husband and I order curbside pick up a lot and I would say 90% of the time something is wrong with our order:  -sides we ordered through a selection on the website aren't included in the bag -food has sauce when asked for no sauce -food is missing ingredients -food is overcooked -food is undercooked -food is SO heavily salted that it is inedible I've given this place so many chances to get it right. I've sworn this place off a few times only to go back. I've reached out to management about this multiple times. We're given a $20 gift card instead of having our meal comped (Which I guess is nice, however, it forces us to go back to use it). It's not even worth calling anymore when something is so far below standard.  If you're going to eat here, make sure you dine in. Most of the time I've had a good experience. But I'd strongly suggest staying away from curbside pickup. The order will always be incorrect or unsatisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville

J P.,"Lewisville, TX",26,40,8,4.0,5/19/2017,I am giving 4 for one reason. The seasonal beer that comes out around November called The Grand Cru. That beer is the bomb. It's a triple Belgium that's 10% ABV. They now limit you to three but but as long as you walk out of the restaurant and not knock over a table you can get more than three.  I had five of these and don't remember how I even got home. I woke up the next day with a new tattoo and only wearing socks. Pretty good beer. As far as the food....the food is ok.

Katherine W.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",1157,452,3291,4.0,7/14/2015,"One of my favorite American chain restaurants, beers come cold, and pizookies come hot. This place can get pretty busy during prime lunch and dinner times, but I've always had decent service. I recomend getting any of their craft beers because they always taste fresh and crisp.  Foodwise I recommend coming for their lunch specials which range from mini pizzas with a single topping (plus it comes it side salad or soup), or half sized sandwiches and pasta. You definitely must not forget to finish your meal off with a pizookie, trust me you won't regret it.  They have a rewards system which is nice, you need to download the app and sign up, but points can rack up pretty fast, just be sure to show your user ID to your server before you check out so they can add the points to your account.  Overall I've always had a great experience and the food is always tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=20
Joel A.,"Irving, TX",142,17,12,5.0,1/10/2017,"Location is meddled with construction along 121 and 35 but the restaurant is not hard to find/navigate through the streets!  Came here with a large party (12 people) during lunch and made reservations beforehand and the table was ready well in time so kudos to their preparation. They have a wide array of beer selections, so I suggest giving the drinks menu a look! They have a bar, large style sitting areas and one on one sitting areas so this place is perfect for almost any time of the day! This place was not super crowded during lunch there was a steady flow of people coming in and out and the restaurant definitely had enough seating (i.e. No wait time).  I recommend their deep dish pizzas the crust is very soft and the sauces perfectly complement each other. The most popular ones I've been told are buffalo chicken, chicken bacon ranch and bbq chicken! The only thing is their chicken falls off the pizza a lot and it looks like the chicken was added on after it baked. Nonetheless, the pizza was still great! You can also do a half and half pizza as well. You can easily split a medium with a friend if you're hungry or a small if you guys aren't that hungry. Pizzas came in about 15 minutes from ordering so definitely can be a stop for lunch if you have an hour! Pizookies are an absolute must if you're a first timer. Perfectly baked cookie with ice cream. The kind of cookie and how much ice cream depends on the size of the pizookie you get but they have a wide variety. Overall great experience and they also give you a free pizookie if it's your birthday so that's a definite reason to head over there on a birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=20

Brady L.,"Denton, TX",36,15,1,2.0,9/22/2016,"On Thursday, September 22nd, two of my co-workers and I decided to eat at BJ's for lunch. When we entered the establishment, it was about half-filled with patrons, and we were promptly greeted and sat by a smiling and personable host. Unfortunately, this concluded our positive experience.  Upon being seated, we were informed our waitress would be Heather, and that she would be with us shortly. At least ten minutes had passed before being acknowledged again, even though our supposed waitress passed by our table countless times. A gentleman reluctantly approached our table, informed us that Heather was a little tied up, and that he would be taking our drink order. We ordered our drinks and he brought them out to us promptly, reassuring us Heather would be with us soon to take our food order. Another ten minutes passes and no signs of Heather, aside from her passing by to tend to her large 10-14 person table; it seems to have monopolized all of her attention. The original gentleman who took our drink order was bussing and cleaning the table behind us when he rhetorically asked if Heather had taken our food order. Frustrated, we laughed, told him no, and he once again tended to us, albeit reluctantly.  Within a reasonable amount of time, a food runner brought us our entrees. The food was delicious. Everything was fresh, hot, and tasty. In the midst of dining and near finishing, Heather finally made her grand entrance; she inexplicably brought us three small plates, all of which remained untouched. No introduction, no apology, no ""can I get you guys anything else,"" or ""how is everything?"" Three. Plates. POOF! Back into non-existence, as far as we were concerned.  We finish our meals (again, to reiterate, the food was delectable), and begin the waiting game for our checks. The gentleman who took all of our orders asked if we needed anything else, to which one of my friends requested another root beer. He responded by telling him he would let Heather know. He pretty much knew he wasn't going to see that refill.  Much to my amazement, here comes Heather, two root beers in hand! They would've been much more enjoyable had they been brought out while we were eating, but alas, it simply wasn't in the cards with Heather's vacuous (at best) attentiveness. When she dropped the drinks off, she gathered our empty plates, and made her exit. Still, not a single word.  At this point, she returned to our table with checks in hand (quickly too! ""TIP TIME!"" PSSSHHHH!). We opened our checks, and what do you know? She managed to mess that up! She split an appetizer evenly amongst the three of us, even though only one person ate it. She walked off to rectify the issue, but turned around after realizing she had no idea who had what entrée; hard to discern when you've had absolutely no involvement.  She returned with corrected checks, and had even removed the cost of our drinks in what I assume was a feeble attempt to make up for her dismal service. We paid, left a deserving $0 tip, and concluded our visit.  In conclusion, my experience at BJ's has always been fantastic on all fronts: food, service, and environment. Unfortunately, Heather's HORRENDOUS service has left a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. I doubt I, or the other two gentlemen I was in the company of, will be returning any time soon. Bravo to the chef, host, and other wait staff who picked up Heather's slack. Heather, maybe look into another career choice, because attitude and customer service are lacking. Try smiling, saying hello, and maybe performing minimum job duties of a waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=20

As far as light eating options go, the Barbacoa Chicken is out of this world! A must try if you are looking for a healthy option.  Other than that sandwiches, pizza, pastas - all are delicious!

It was really jumping for a Tuesday night and we had to wait in the bar for a table. The bar was packed, too. So, we snagged a couple of brews (they have Stone IPA on tap!) and waited. Soon the buzzer went off and we were seated. We were seated near the server station. Our server was right there, offering us drinks and an app; we commented that since we hadn't fully reviewed the menu, could he please come back in a few? Sure. Meanwhile, we perused the extensive menu and settled on an app. He took our app order and asked if we were ready to also order entrees. Since I don't much care for having apps and entrees delivered together, we asked if he could come back. He seemed a little annoyed. Once the app was delivered, we said we were ready to order. Giant got the Chinese chopped salad, and I ordered the Tavern Cut Pizza; I asked if I could add some items? Sure. I'd like to add Roasted Red Peppers. Red Pepper, he asked? Or Bell Peppers? Roasted Red Bell Peppers, I repeated, knowing they are on the menu. Also, green olives. OK, he said and off he went. Short time later, he delivered the Giant's salad, and my pizza with green bell peppers and kalamata olives.  The food was good; pizza had a nice thin crisp crust and the Giant appeared to enjoy his salad.  Now, I'm tired. I've been traveling and up since before dawn, so when server came by to ask how everything was, I didn't lie, but I didn't complain, either. Just ordered another beer. Through all of this, the server appeared a little annoyed. Not sure why; he seemed to be having a great time congregating at the server station with his buds. There are so many other outposts of this chain around DFW. I think I'll stop in at a different one next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=20

I went during Sunday Night Football. I was seated immediately. They happily changed the TVs closest to my table to the football game and also the NLCS baseball game that was on. The waiter came immediately to take drink orders and was prompt and attentive. The food came out quickly, hot and delicious. I ordered a variety of apps for the table: potato skins, southwest egg rolls, carnitas fries and stuffed mushrooms. The carnitas fries are amazing and by far the favorite!!! Everything else was also really delicious. The servings were large for the price. Finished off the night with a chocolate chunk pizookie-WOW!  So, I'm not sure what poor service others got but my visit here was stellar and I'll definitely go back.

Michelle Z.,"The Colony, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/28/2017,"EAT AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! A mere $40 dinner ended up costing me over $3000 which included an ER visit and missed work!! My husband and I stopped for dinner, he had the pizza, I ordered the jambalaya. About an hour after leaving the restaurant I started feeling ill. Several hours later I got sick!! Fluid was pouring out of every orifice of my body. I can say I have never been this ill in my life. That spicey jambalaya is awful coming up!! This went on for several hours until my body started cramping. I called a Dr who advised me to head to the ER. At the hospital the er Dr told me I was well on my way to dehydration and it was a good thing I came in. While in the hospital I had an allergic reaction to the pain meds I was given which caused additional issues! After getting everything under control I was sent home. It took me a couple days to recover... My body was exhausted! We called Bj's prior to heading to the hospital to let them know that I had gotten food poisoning from eating their tainted jambalaya, just wanted to give them a heads up. Didn't want anyone else going through what I experiencing at that moment! They were uncaring! The manager took my number down and said someone would call back. They turned my number over to their headquarters Risk management department. After 3 months, BJ's determined that they were not the cause for my food poisoning. Not sure how they came to that conclusion since my husband and I had eaten the same things over the previous days except that one meal and I can assure it was jambalaya rapidly escaping my body! We never asked for money, just wanted them to be aware! They just don't care! STAY AWAY or really.... Eat at your own risk!! We won't EVER be returning to this BJ's or any of them for that matter!!

Adam M.,"Irving, TX",3,26,,1.0,3/1/2015,"Poor service. Very disappointed because I love BJs. Do not recommend this location.  We were seated on a small table. No prob there. Asked the server about the difference between the vegetarian pizza vs. the veggie prime. She said they were basically the same but in reality she did not know the difference. Ordered a large pizza, clam chowder in a bread bowl with Cesar salad, fried calamari and a side of fries. The calamari was soggy and soft. All the food except for the soup was mildly warm. Almost room temp. So in a couple of minutes they did become room temperature. Everything tasted good though but not fun to eat room temperature food.  So initially we were served the calamari. The rest of the food was brought to the table except for the fries. The server left the calamari plate. So we had all the food plus one of those drink menus at our table. There was very little room to eat at all. No biggie, I'll just tell the server to clear away some stuff. We also wanted Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper for our pizza. The problem was that our server did not come back to our table for the whole meal. So it was really uncomfortable to eat our cold food cause there was no room. Also we didn't have Parmesan cheese and red pepper so we could not eat our pizza the way we wanted to.  I was trying to look around for our server and couldn't find her. When I finally found her she was just talking to the other servers! I saw her talking for a couple of minutes then I lost track of her. When she came back I told her to cancel the fries, to get us boxes and the check. It was a very frustrating experience because the food tasted good but the temperature of the food and the service sucked. I was so upset I didn't even order a pazookie...

After 5 minutes our drink order was taken. A few minutes later drinks arrived. Drinks are great as usual. Service not so hot though , we ordered and she didn't take the menus, also I will add that we are at the smallest 2 person table. The guy dropping off the food also wasn't gonna take the menus , we had to ask. We also had to ask for silverware.  The happy hour flatbreads were very good. After the flatbreads were gone now the server and staff will not take our dirty plates and dirty glasses, we have no room on the table. We got up ourselves and handed our dirty plates to a passing food runner. Our waitress passed us many times without clearing our table.  Understanding that this is busy night we came in knowing that service might be slower than usual however, after noticeably seeing that multiple staff (ie. servers, bussers, food runners, and even management) have passed our table multiple times, it is crazy to me that a few simple things were not noticed after maybe 20 minutes. (Not to mention the many tables around us)  To summarize it all: If you come here, you can expect above par food however, expect for your dining experience to be double it's time and to feel pretty much forgotten. Not sure what's going on with this location, but they definitely need a heavy change over of staff.   I give this location two stars because I know that I can come to every BJs and expect to get the same quality of food, however if I could rate purely on service it would most definitely be a zero.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=100

The manager on duty was Tiffany, And the hostess was Kelsey.   Upon entering the foyer the hostess Kelsey was looking lost and disinterested.  She did not attempt to ask who was first, which made the three parties standing there uncomfortable.  It was a busy night around 10pm.   I told her we had a party of two, and she gestured over to the bar as said we could sit there if we wanted to.  It was packed and I said, is there any seating? Which she shrugged and said ""I don't know you have to look."" I looked, and when I came back she was already helping another party who had arrived AFTER we had. Eventually we were seated, and as soon as we were seated I asked our seated for the manager immeadiately.  After five minutes Tiffany came to our table.  I told her that I understand that  it was really busy, but her hostess was unnecessarily rude for no reason, and it made me feel uncomfortable.  Her eyes got wide and she said ""okay I will get preston to take care of you."" And ran away. After Preston took our drink orders, I asked him for a business card with the managers name and store number.  Tiffany came back with a rewards card and said that if we wanted to we could join the rewards program so we could fill put surveys.

They've got a decent lunch menu that's actually managable to read. I had the mahi mahi fish tacos. They were superb. Good crunch and texture and the fish was nice and flaky.  The fish is served either blackened or fried. I opted for lower calories and went with the blackened fish. Place gets pretty packed during lunch but there's enough space here so it's a good spot for a power lunch and for under 10 bucks. Service is inconsistent and very slow at times. They sat us near the bathroom. It smells. Avoid sitting near the bathroom. Which is located straight ahead from the facade (i think). Overall, not a favorite but if you've got a picky crowd of guests this is the place to go because they've got entrees from burgers to pizza to salad to chicken tortilla soup.

Yeah, Pizza on a gluten free crust. The crust was thin and had herbs infused in it. I had my three favorite toppings Mushrooms, onions and anchovies, along with cheese & sauce.

Nothing ordered was out the ordinary. Just a turkey burger. The thing that really set off the night was when she tipped over a martini into a nearby glass of water. About half the glass was gone and the water looked like lemonade.  The waitress didn't offer a replacement until the persons' drink she spilled, asked for another martini.  The waitress said she only spilled a ""little bit"" and would only bring out that much (as she pinched her index finger and thumb together).  That was AFTER she already gave out checks and also forgot the desert we ordered but still billed us.

When my friend asked for some additional bread for her pasta the waitress went out of her way to get my friend more bread. The splitting of the wine was fine amongst the bill. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because we had to hunt down our waitress to get our bill.

My wife and I both ordered the pot roast.  It comes with mashed potatoes and crispy veggies.  The dish was perfect!  The pot roast was as soft as butter, the mashed potatoes full of flavor, and the veggies added crispy texture. The beer is excellent!!! They have dozens of options brewed at the restaurant as well as abroad.  I ordered a Jeremiah Red, an Irish beer that balances malty hops and light fruit flavors.   We were too stuffed for dessert, but all in all, 2 pot roasts, an Iced Tea and the beer cost us $35...what a value!  If you're ever in Dallas on the way to Denton I suggest you check out BJ's Brehouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=220

In the end I got the pizookie cuz I wasn't really stuffed from my ""meal"" (the calzone just comes as is, no sides) My friends were all raving about this deep dish cookie. I had the oatmeal raisin. It was good--hot, gooey, and chewy with quickly melting ice cream on top, what's not to like? But really, I could have made the same slice and bake cookie at home and I was expecting something really yummy and unique. The good thing though is the cookie profits go to charity for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=200

Steven S.,"Arlington, TX",138,225,32,3.0,1/8/2010,"Service - 3 Stars Food - 3 Stars Overall decor - 4 Stars House brews - 2 Stars I wanted a pizza. Did I know of any great 5 Star pizza places in Lewisville? Did I have my computer with me to check yelp reviews? When the answer is no to both those questions, sometimes you got to just settle for a chain restaurant you know. I've started eating at BJ's because my son took me there, saying they had some good pizza. Since my son knows good pizza like the Pope knows the Bible, this was recommendation enough. He was right on. I devoured that buttery tasting crust, perfectly cooked, without that burned edge some places like to put on. I mean, why pay for burned pizza edges, when I can do that at home for free? But anyway, the toppings were ample, and they came all the way to the pizza's edge, not just clustered around the center like some places put them. The pizza sauce allowed you to taste the tomatoes, but without drowning the other toppings. A little more cheese might have earned an extra star in my food rating. Who knows? The home brewed beers, though, they were another thing. I may be old and crotchety, but I just don't get this tiny brewery stuff. I mean, who's got that kind of beer palate? I mean, being able to distinguish all these little flavors they describe on the menus, like wino's do. Opps, I meant oenophiles. The Gospel Truth is, after the first two beers, I barely can taste any differences in beer. Except for the mule p*ss beers, of course. I mean, my taste buds don't die after a couple of beers, they just get less discriminating. Like some people.  I tried a flight of BJ's home brewed, and I just  had no desire to fly any of them again. Like my experiences with US Air, once was way too much. I did enjoy the decor. I'm no HGTV wannabe, but the overall effect of the layout, the lighting from the numerous TV's, the wide open area, and the black leather/faux leather booths were soothing to my masculine tastes.  There's nothing wrong with chain restaurants, as long as they do their food properly, and its hard to compete with corporate money when it comes to the size and quality of the restaurant's furnishings. Sometimes, its alright to settle for 3 Star today, while you're waiting to discover those 5 Star finds. That could be a dating tip, as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=200

All kidding aside, If you want to get together with some friends or coworkers for a drink and some ""bar"" food then this is a good choice.  If your friends are dragging you here and you want something really tasty then get the clam chowder; its a surprise hit on a minefield of a menu. Everything else is pretty much corporate, food by committee.  The pizza is alright nothing spectacular, and the meatloaf has a taste you won't be able to wash out of your mouth.  Everything else is hit and miss.  You'll just have to experiment.

However I finished my appetizer and beer in 10 minutes and waitress was still MIA during that period.  Manager asked the table nearby how things were but skipped over my table.  Then the busboy came by and I asked for table to be cleared. I wasn't chasing down the waitress to place my order after waiting a while. It wasn't that busy to me.

John A.,"Dallas, TX",87,25,4,5.0,11/18/2010,"I would live at this restaurant if I could. I first went to a BJ's when I was in Reno, NV, visiting my college roommate, and I was very impressed with their pizza, microbrews, and overall menu. When I found there were a couple in Dallas, I was overjoyed.  It's basically a step-in for Two Rows, which to my knowledge finally closed their last doors in 2008: a brew pub with fantastic food, lots of televisions, and a good family-friendly atmosphere. Don't worry, people without kids, it's not a frustrating experience if all you want to do is get hammered and watch sports. I'm sure they have annoying birthday rituals, but it's nothing that I've ever noticed.  The pizza is fantastic - deep dish Chicago-style with lots of toppings and incredibly well prepared. I love their Heffe-Weisen as well as their Pale Ale; all of their beers have their own unique names and great taste.  This particular BJ's is 21 miles from my door, and I have no problem gassing up the car and making a road trip. If you're ever in the area and are looking for great food and beer in a good environment, I'd highly recommend BJ's.  P.S.

Edward S.,"Flower Mound, TX",6,3,,3.0,4/14/2008,"Largely Forgettable... So after I discovered that Costco closes the gas pumps after 7PM on Sunday we decided to give B.J.'s a try.  They have a cute story on the menu about the guys who started the chain, but it is obvious that the personal touch has escaped them since. This is one of the remaining places that brew their own beer, and the Pale Ale was tasty, as was the Blonde my wife had, but $4.50 for a pint of beer? The service was pretty good, but at 7:30 on a Sunday evening when the place was sparsely busy, they managed to quadruple seat our waitress.  We had to wait on several occasions and flag down other servers/managers because she was tied up taking orders etc. The food was average at best also, with the only bright spot being the chicken fingers we ordered for my son - tasty breading and served nice and hot.  My wife and I split a burger with cheddar and bacon - the bacon looked like it came out of a pre-cooked package and they used sliced cheese which was not fully melted.  The wedge cut and seasoned fries were pretty tasty, but I had to call the manager over to replace the ones they served us ice cold with the burger - he very quickly delivered a hot side dish. I also love the places that say that they proudly serve ""Kraft Mac & Cheese"" and then charge you an arm and leg for a serving that you could have made at home for far less $$$. So overall I rate a place based on whether or not I would return and this is one that I will probably not give a second chance.  Too many other choices!  The only reason I might go back is that we did not try their signature item...the thick crust pizza - perhaps they get that one right more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=240

HOWEVER, i will give incredible respect to bj's corporate. a quick e-mail got me in touch with the regional manager who let me know the manager was being re-trained and the waiter would no longer be an issue. she then sent me a gift card for $75. i used it at the bj's in lewisville where we had great service and left the entire $75 on a $30 meal.  needless, to say it's because i won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=240

Jaime A.,"Dallas, TX",12,37,,4.0,10/14/2008,"So friend of mine recently purchased a home in Carrolton off 121 and Hebron. Nice house nice area, but that's not part of this review. I met him and his girlfriend for dinner and few drinks. He suggested BJ's in Lewisville off 35, which I politely agreed to. I arrived first and not wanting to wait in the entry way amongst a sea of acne faced teens I proceeded to the bar. My timing was perfect as I was able to secure a table just as a few patrons were exiting. The bussing staff was quick to clear the table and wipe it down and as soon is he was done my waitress arrived to take my drink order. Normally that wouldn't be that impressive except for how crowded and packed the restaurant already was. Oh! Let me mention now that I am impressed with the eye candy of Lewisville!! I may have to come back this way more often. Back to the review I knew it was a brew house so I simply asked the waitress to bring me their house ""Red"". She said it wasn't a problem, and again I was impressed because now I'm excited she knew what I was asking for. I later took a look at the local flavors and realized there is quite the selection. Nothing like the New Belgium brew houses in Colorado, but then again nobody's perfect.  As my friends arrived we were able to converse in a normal tone for as crowded as it was the high ceilings probably aided in keeping the noise level down. After exchanging pleasantries and cracking some jokes the waitress came back to take their drink order. I was hungry so I asked my friends to order a good appetizer. They insisted the Avocado Egg Rolls be ordered. Knowing they had been here before I went with their selection and I certainly wasn't disappointed. The tamarind sauce they are served with really compliments the avocado. The dinner menu has quite the selection and if you're with a group of people with different tastes everyone should still be able to find something that suits their appetite. I personally had the BBQ chicken chopped salad. Be warned it isn't a small salad! Unless you are really hungry I recommend ordering a half order if possible. I never made it to desert because I kept putting down the red beer they had, so I apologize for not being much of assistance in that category. A casual evening with some goof friends really was a great time. The atmosphere at BJ's was festive and plenty of TVs to watch some college football.

One of the people in our party managed to flag a server down who told us she knew nothing about our order.  We asked her to get the manager and he came back and again took our order.  We managed to get our pizza that we ordered but still no drinks.  Not even water.  We ate the pizza and were very upset at this point and wanted to leave.  When I attempted to tab out the pizza was on my check as well as 4 drinks I never got.  I again twirled my napkin in the air, since this seemed to get the manager's attention.  When the manager came back to our table I explained that we got the pizza and ate it but never got the drinks.  I didn't feel I should have to pay for them.  The manager then took the check and came back after a while and the pizza was removed but the drinks I never got were still on the check.  At this point I just wanted to get out of the restaurant and didn't care what it cost me.  So, I paid the check with no further question and left.  Later I found out from a business colleague that the pizza wound up on his check????  I think overall this is a good restaurant but I was so upset with the management this particular night I will probably never go back again.  I really don't know what they could have done worse than charging people for things they never received.  I do not recommend this location but I have had good luck with other locations in Addison, and Dallas Area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-lewisville?start=240

Check out the happy hour m- f 3:00-7:00. They feature $1 off beer and cocktails, $2 off apps., & 1/2 priced mini pizzas.

This is not the kind of thing that I would normally order at all but a friend of mine ordered it once and I have been hooked ever since. It's especially yummy if you asked for extra bruschetta vineaigrett. If you server is newer they will have no idea what you are talking about and they'll bring balsamic. The bruschetta vineaigrett is almost black in color and has a tangy kick. Oh, one last thing no Bj's meal is complete without a pizzookie. It's a cookie baked in a pan like a small pizza toppled with ice cream.
