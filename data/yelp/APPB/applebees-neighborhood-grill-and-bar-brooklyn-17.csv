Lee R.,"Manhattan, NY",29,61,82,5.0,8/26/2015,"Took my kids for an evening out to dinner before shopping. The restaurant was spacious, nice and clean. Our waitress was very pleasant, she kept checking in on us which was appreciated. My kids got the chicken finger kid's meal. They loved them. I think it's great that you can add an additional side for .99.  The waitress suggested that I try the brunch burger which consisted of bacon, onion, fried egg, crispy hashbrowns, American cheese and ketchup. It was delicious. My drink of choice was a frozen strawberry lemade. I can't wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=40
Ariel S.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,153,20,4.0,7/31/2015,"Im actually surprised at the low rating for this Applebees, have ya'll  been to the one downtown Brooklyn? That one deserves zero stars. This place does have hits and misses. Sometimes the food sucks, sometimes you get apathetic staff but for the Happy Hour special ALONE, how clean the place looks and the fact that the drinks ACTUALLY have liquor in them makes me quite happy.

Yvie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,2,,1.0,7/30/2016,"This is by far the absolute worst Applebee's I've ever been to. The service was atrocious. The orders took incredibly long and all the while the wait staff was huddled together in one spot conversing. It took about 20 minutes for someone to come to our table to ask if we needed anything. I, then, placed an order to go and got home without a full meal. When I called to explain, the manager was ridiculously rude and gave me no choice but to return to the establishment to get the forgotten order or I'd have to pay for a meal I didn't receive. It was a complete inconvenience and they showed no sincerity whatsoever. Needless to say I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=40

There was one waiter who was running from table to table while another one was casually strolling from one table to the next.  My friend and I both ordered the steak sirloin and shrimp. We waited a really long time there from waiting for someone to take our order to us receiving the food, took almost an hour. When the food came, the meat was tough.

Alice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,6,1.0,5/13/2016,"This Applebee's was probably the worst service I ever had.  My co-workers decided that during spring break we would try to treat ourselves to a nice lunch because we rarely get the chance to do so, especially since we have a very short lunch break.  There were only 8-9 of us, there was barely anyone in the restaurant when we arrived and we ordered fairly quickly...I'd say within 10 minutes of arriving. We expected good food for the amount of time we waited, but that was not the case.  Usually a restaurant would serve you water or drinks right away, at least a good restaurant would.  Some of us ordered soda, I ordered a strawberry lemonade and another co-worker ordered a peach green tea..or some,other kind of mixed drink with no alcohol.  We waited a while, we were talking and the sodas came, but there was no water, strawberry lemonade or peach green tea.  We asked maybe 20 minutes after we ordered the waitress went to check on it.  She said that the bartender had to make it and they were waiting on her.  We waited another 15 minutes and I approached another waiter about the drinks...10 more minutes later, I canceled my strawberry lemonade and the peach green tea.  I don't see any manager on site, so  I called corporate and I kid you not, once they heard me calling corporate, we received water and a pepsi, I canceled my drink and told them to just give me a pepsi if that would make things go faster. The representative from corporate was nice and tried to help, but I'm sorry that did,t do much.  He contacted the manager and the manager came to the table.  I told the manager about our issue and that it was not okay for a restaurant to take 45 minutes to bring a drink. And that we still had not received any food, meanwhile other customers were already receiving their food even though they arrived to the restaurant and ordered later than we did.  The food came about 15 minutes later and the manager said he would figure out the check later.  The bonelss bbq wings that my colleagues ordered were cold.  Another colleague's chicken salad was cold.  My colleague and I ordered steak with broccoli and Mac and cheese.  I said I wanted the same exact sides as in the picture.  We got peppers instead of broccoli and the steak was over done.  My colleague's steak was probably almost double the size of mine and the waitress didn't even ask me how I wanted my steak.  They gave us a side of broccoli, but it tastes like it came from a bag.  Another colleague ordered a cheeseburger with fries, and the cheese want even melted.  I'm not sure whether she asked for no lettuce and tomatoes or not....but there was nothing to dress the burger up. I've never heard of a restaurant just serving a cheeseburger and fries with no lettuce or tomatoes...maybe no pickle and coleslaw, but no lettuce or tomatoes?  Another colleague had to wait an extra 15 minutes for her salmon dish.  She said it was good, but if you just saw what we ordered you'd be repulsed that this Applebee's is even still opened.  The manager wasn't even helpful at all.  He kept mentioning that our group was a big group and saying that the waitress was New.  We argued that if we're such a big party, why would they send us a new waitress to serve our group.  He then said that we should call ahead of time,next time,so he could prepare. It didn't make sense either way.  He even tried to get more business from us By asking if we wanted to have any graduation party since we're from a school.  I was shocked at how he seemed to believe the fault was not with him.  We asked for the check and that took another 10-15 minutes...maybe even more.  Then after we were finally given the check, they only gave us 50% off...the order was not even correct on the receipt, so no wonder the order was wrong. The total came to about $75....we quickly got our money together and no one came to collect the bill...it was probably another 10 minutes or so and then I just got up and gave him the $80.  We should have honestly just got up and left, because that was not even close to a $75 meal. I told him that we should not even have been charged for the sodas and he just nodded his head.  This Applebees should be stripped of their title as a restaurant or needs to be put under new management, because it doesn't seem like the manager cares about their service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=40

Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",613,1079,2515,2.0,9/9/2013,"So here is the problem with Applebees @ the Junction... there is absolutely no sense of urgency in the entire place.  Waitstaff/kitchen is sooooooo slow.   I've been there 3 times now.... being the optimistic gal I am I thought maybe, just maybe it wouldn't be so bad this time around. I was wrong. The most recent occasion took place last Saturday night.  It wouldn't have been my first choice but my guests had been traveling all day and were just in need of food- any food.  So Applebees it is! We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday evening and found a crowded restaurant (as to be expected) and were told our wait would be 20 minutes (ok..) so we headed to the bar and waited it out.  The service we received at the bar was the highlight of the night.  I don't remember our bartenders name but he was just lovely.  He acknowledged us immediately, placed napkins down, and offered up a couple specials.  It only took him a couple minutes to deliver our drinks.  Mine, a jumbo peach sangria, was delish.  We should have just stayed at the bar...  Not long after we finished our drinks one of the hosts came by to seat us.  He led us around the restaurant to a booth and sat us.  But didn't give us any menus.  Hmm, ok.  Fast forward another 10 minutes... we still don't have menus or a waitress.  We so should have stayed at the bar...  Waitress finally arrived, took our drink order, apologized for the lack of menus, delivered menus and disappeared.  After what seemed like a lifetime our food made its way our of the kitchen.  Appetizers up first.  They took a while to arrive but both were good.  The fried green beans are strange but really good.  The boneless buffalo wings were  served on a plate (don't they usually come in a basket?) and I counted 7.  Call me crazy but I'm almost positive that any other time I've visited an Applebees I've gotten at least 10 wings.  I bet the bartender would have given me 10. Our table ordered 3 meals- steak, talapia, and a salad.   The Lemon & Pepper Steak was cooked correctly and was decent in size.   The Oriental Chicken salad came with a good size piece of teriyaki chicken and wayyyy too many almonds - like a whole bag of almonds (overcompensating for something Applebees?)   The Blackened Talapia was forgotten.   So we wait.  and wait. and wait.  The waitress was no where to be found.  When she did surface again she went and sat in the booth behind us for a little visit.   Hmmm ok.  Meanwhile we're still missing a meal.  The whole operation took nearly 2 hours.  No one seemed to care that we didn't have menus.  Waitress was terrible at refilling drinks and was more interested in socializing than serving.   And then our table received their meals in 2 different batches about 20 minutes apart.  So frustrating! My favorite part- when we received the bill my friend looks it over and finds out that the cocktail he ordered was made with Grey Goose.  At no point did he ever tell the waitress he wanted Grey Goose.  Unless specified the bartenders would make a drink w/ the house liquor, right?   So waitress thought she'd be smooth and order up Grey Goose.  Awesome. $18 and 2 drinks later... we left Applebees.   Next time I'll just stay at the bar... or skip Applebees all together and go for pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=40

Cynthia L.,"Manhattan, NY",186,746,1300,4.0,3/22/2015,"The service is great - the waitress was very patient and kind, allowing my friend and i more time to think about what we wanted to order. She came back several times to check up on us too. However, the wait for food was longer than expected (probably 30 minutes for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer to come out).  My friend and I had the 2 for $26 deal + one appetizer. They're a bit scant when it comes to appetizers. We got the mozzarella sticks and our dish had 4 pieces; I really enjoyed eating it and wished they had more.. :( don't rely on the online applebees menu or pictures. I saw 8 mozzarella sticks, and we only got 4. Pictures are deceiving! I ordered the fiesta chicken something (forgot the name) and my friend had the shrimp and fries. My order came with a woven basket thing under my plate. It felt very authentic and I loved it. The plate was beautifully executed with colorful edible chips, rice, a variety of cheeses on my chicken and a slice of lemon to top it off. My meal tasted absolutely divine - everything complimented each other quite well. The chicken was cooked to perfection - juicy and tender.  My friend's order had fried shrimp, French fries, a small portion of cole saw and a super tiny ketchup dip (which didn't matter because all tables are provided with a big ketchup bottle, so you could add as much ketchup as you'd like). The fried shrimp was good, however the French fries were very stale and dry. It was hard to swallow and digest without chugging down water after each fry. We ended up abandoning more than half of the fries. The restaurant is pretty clean. The plates and utensils are spot on perfect. The booth that we sat in was in new condition and the restaurant itself was on it's A game. They also have a bar for you drinkers out there!

And I actually like kind of weak, foofy cocktails. You can people watch from the big windows that open on the Junction foot traffic and the staff is nice enough. Dallas BBQ around the corner is the same sort of deal but the atmosphere is too rowdy for me to relax with a drink there.

Djinou J.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,54,20,1.0,7/23/2012,"I agree with the rest of the reviewers that this Applebees SUCKS. I live only a few blocks away but I will be starving and bored on a Friday night and I still won't go here. I've been here numerous times and each time it's half assed service and half assed food. Now I understand this is Applebees AKA a fancier version of McDonald's, but there is no reason for it to be this bad. This establishment is just ghetto in terms of service. I do disagree with the other review that you'll need a bulletproof vest; thats a bit of an exaggeration , its def not that crazy or dangerous over there. Most Applebees in nyc are terrible and i dont know why. When i lived in upstate NY, the Applebees was so good you would think they were a completely different chain than the ones in the city. The appetizers are literally half of what I'm used to gettig at my upstate location. We ordered the boneless wings and got 4 pieces that barely had sauce on them. The mozzerella sticks come cold. The burgers canbe good but the meat is always cooked wrongly.  I order medium-well and I receive well done. Dont you dare order well done or you will get it a rock on a bun. Maybe I should order medium-rare next time and they'll get it right? Idk. Servers usually disappear after dropping off your food and never check back in. Everytime I eat here I feel like I should have saved myself the wasted expectation of okay service and just eaten McDonald's or some other crap, at least I know what to expect with them.

Wonton tacos is ok. Comes in 4 - quite salty. Basic wonton skin fried with cole slaw and chicken. Apple Reuben with fries is very salty.

James F.,"Brooklyn, NY",292,295,280,4.0,12/30/2008,"3.5 stars Nothing more hated than chain restaurants; that is unless you live in East Flatbush, an area dominated by fast food, chinese and west indian takeout. It's seen as a triumph, as if the neighborhood has reached some level of desirability if a major chain opens around here. When I was considering moving back to the area one of my mom's arguments for it was that there was a Starbuck's and Duane Reade within walking distance :). This Applebee's is probably going to be successful whether it's good or not. It has no competition and it's located near Brooklyn College, several bus stops and the last stop on 2 train. Having said that so far it's a pretty good addition to the neighborhood. The service was great. Approaching the bar, the bartender put out her hand, so I instinctively reached for my wallet to give her my ID. Turns out she was trying to shake my hand and introduce herself. Courtesy like this is, unfortunately, not that common in this area. Additionally she directed me to a lunch special which was similar to but cheaper than what I initially intended to order. I ordered a french onion soup with 2 bacon cheeseburger sliders. I have no complaints, the food was satisfying. Actually it was quite good, tasty bar food. I can see myself eating here again.

The first time was when my parents were visiting and they ordered take out before I even came home from work.  The food was fine for what it was but I can't speak for the service because I wasn't involved. The second time I wasn't actually succesful in eating at the place.  I decided to pop in during lunch on a day off, thinking maybe an appetizer or a salad would be a good decision.  The host sat me fairly quickly at a booth three booths away from the host stand/entrance.  The place was pretty dead, I'd say maybe 15% to capacity as it was pretty late for lunch.  I sat at this booth for nearly 15 minutes without anyone saying so much as one word to me.  To add insult to injury, they were playing some sort of gospel music quite loudly over the sound system and without the din of people speaking to distract me, it was painful.  I mean, I'm all for religious music if that's what you like, but only in the privacy of your home/car/office.  Not in a chain restaurant. Toward the end of my wait, they seated an older woman in the booth in front of mine.  Within two minutes, the host was over there asking her if she wanted anything to drink while she waited!  By the time he made it to my table a minute later, I was in the process of standing up to leave.   ""Would you care for something to-"" ""Yeah, no.  I'm just gonna go."" ""Too long a wait?"" ""Yeah.  Thanks anyway!"" I mean seriously?!? If you know why I'm pissed, why did you let me sit there waiting for so long?!   I didn't want to tip whatever neglectful ass that would've been waiting on me for food I'm not even that fond of then, and I doubt I'll go back anytime soon for the same reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=80

Called ahead so I could just walk in and walk out, but it still took them 15 min to bring out my order (even though I called head and waited the 20min they said when it would be ready.   I brought it back to the theatre and had dinner in the projection booth -- nice and quiet indeed!  BUT then I opened the food.  The steak was as tuff as rubber, worse even, because rubber wouldn't get stuck in your teeth -- I swear, grizzle lodged between every tooth.  The tilapia was OK...broke apart nicely with a fork so that means it was fresh and it was seasoned nicely, although a bit too salty for my taste.  But then come the magic union rings -- they were rings alright, but EMPTY...no onions inside the over cooked-on-the-verge of being burnt -- HOLLOW rings of batter -- no onions. The spinach dip was slimy and had enough salt to make your lips get all puckered...salty raisin lips.  And then there was the tomato basil soup.  Tasty soup indeed, but unfortunately the container was 1/4 full.  I checked the bag...perhaps the top opened in transit and soup spilled out -- but no, not a drop.  While I was looking in the bag, I also checked to see if, hey, maybe somehow the onions fell out of the batter rings (I still can't figure out how you can make hollow rings with no onions inside). While I was pissed at not getting any onions,, I admit I was fascinated on how they did it...like when you are amazed at how a magician does a magic trick!  How they did the quarter cup of soup was not magic...just sloppiness. Aside from this particular take-out, I had gone back for sit-down meal and everything everyone has been saying here on Yelp unfortunately is true -- everything that has to happen once you walk in the door takes a half hour -- to get a waiter, half hour; to get your drinks, half hour; to get your food, half hour; and gawdforbid you need to get something extra, like butter or water...half hour.  Need to get a check so you can get your butt out of there....could even be MORE than a half hour.  I kid you not. That said, I must add that the waiters and waitresses, spread thin as they are, are usually pretty friendly, and that is saying a lot because given how pissed people must get with the long wait times, they probably get more nastiness thrown their way than they deserve.  Complain to management, not the poor put-upon lower level workers.   Yah, so downgraded to one star...like so many other reviews here.

Christian V.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,109,,3.0,1/11/2016,"Living in a food city like New York, one can easily become quite snobbish when it comes to chain restaurants - I know I can.  But, is it snobby when you know you can find superior food for the same amount or less elsewhere?  That's what I've never understood about those who rush to chains in this fine city; there are so many great joints where an awesome meal can be had on the cheap.  By the way, I feel the same about many overpriced ""fancy"" joints that really feed the elitists.   Applebee's is always conveniently located near a shopping hub, and typically lures you in because you've neglected to eat; feeling a rumble in your tummy, you survey the land, and\ Voila!, there's an Applebee's.  Each time I've eaten here, I've vowed never to return.  The food often has a not-so-fresh taste, and cleanliness is not a priority for many of the locations.  Needless to say, I never plan on eating at an Applebee's, but it happens, either from aforementioned hunger attacks, or after simply having too many beers at the bar. True to form, after a few hours shopping at the junction, I find myself here, because there really aren't an abundance of places to dine in the area.  Believe it or not, I would consider returning here just because....just because I enjoy it.  It is, in my opinion, definitely the best location in Brooklyn, with the most comfortable (read sensible) bar I've encountered at an Applebee's.  The food, while not the best, at least emerges from the kitchen on clean plates; no scraping of crud before chowing down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=20

But I went there on a Sunday afternoon with my bf to grab a bite, it was the worst decision I've ever made. Frost they asked us to move from where we were seated, because they needed to make space for a party of 12, which was fine by me and to make it to us the manager even over us free dessert, so I was totally up for it. When we reminded her to let our server know she moved us, she stated that the section we're in isn't the server's section, someone else will take care of us. By the time we moved our server had already gotten our order, so the new girl didn't want to serve us. Something about not stepping over the other server's toe. Totally understandable I used to work in commission. So our server come give us our food. I had shrimp with steamed broccoli and my bf had medium rare steak. Nothing special about the scrimp dish but the steak was not our my bf wanted it, he was like whatever let it go. The whole time we were there no one came to check on us and ask whether or not we needed anything else. None of the servers came back to our tables we couldn't even get a refill on our glasses of water.  I was over it, so I called a random server told her if we could have our check please. 30 min went and gone and no one check, no one, zero customer service. I was so mad that I thought about walking out of there without paying. But as a regular happy hour college student customer I added up our meals n drink together and left the cash on the table.

Ana X.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,16,3.0,8/3/2012,"I believe service has improved over the years. I remember once when a group of 4 went to dine in and the appetizers (quesidillas and buffalo wings) took 20 minutes to come. In that time our drinks didn't arrive yet. After eating the appetizers and still no sight of drinks we called the manager who told us she was sorry and when we asked to be compensated she told us that wouldn't be necessary as the drinks are coming now. The drinks didnt arrive until our meal did another 20 mins after. I stopped going for a while but recently started night classes at Brooklyn College. So the after class hang out spot was none other than Applebees. We come almost every Tuesday and Thursday. We request happy hour where a select few drinks are 5$. The appetizers are half price which makes it about 4-6$ for each item. Everything else is regularly priced. Food:  The food is hit and miss. With going so often I try many different dishes. Today its great, next week not so much. Sizzling dishes are always a MISS. It's ALWAYS burnt. When I asked the waiter if there's anything the chef can do to prevent burning (after having 3 burnt meals with rubbery rice) he said no. Its a hot plate blah blah blah the chef doesnt set the temp blah blah blah. Apparently some people like the burn. I do not. Service: Some waiters are great and since we go so often we are known by face by a few. There's one in particular that always has a scowl and a nasty attitude. My friend once requested hot water to place her utensils in and his response was ""People who do that are stupid. Hot water wont clean it anymore than it already is. Theres no soap, theres no scrubbing. Do you still want it?"" Seriously!?? She proceeded to curse him out. And where the tip line is on the receipt wrote ""word of the day: tact"" We now avoid him wheneever we go. Wait time is only long if you request happy hour and theres some kind of game for the night. Crowd: You can never control who comes to your establishment but often times I wonder what were these people thinking. Ive now seen a girl at the bar drink so much she projectile vomitted all over the place. Luckily we were done with our meal and left immediately after. People around her stayed put and just avoided the vomit. YUCK!!!! Ive seen girls with their nasty behinds sitting on the bar counter. Ive seen females so drunk and loud ready to throw down at anyone who even glance their way Females being escorted out by friends because they are so drunk A female so out of it after being escorted out she was outside banging on the  glass wall Funny Ive yet to see an out of control male patrton.

David F.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,5,,1.0,10/29/2009,"We like to go to Applebee's as a treat during particularly hard work weeks. The service, once again, was awful.  Our waitress was very polite, but does it really take twenty minutes to get drinks and take an order? I understand that it's lunchtime and the restaurant is busy, but is that really an excuse for such poor service? The fact that they have a mandatory gratuity for parties of six or more is just insulting given the level of service provided. If that was the extent of the poor service, I am not sure I'd be complaining.  But it continued. We waited over an hour for our food, which is pretty awful because we only get an hour for lunch. People at the tables around us came and left. When our food finally came out, some of the orders were mixed up. We couldn't even start eating together because our food didn't come out at the same time. Each time she brought a dish, the waitress scurried away before even asking if we needed anything else or if everything was satisfactory. I had to flag her down so I could get a little mustard for my burger. A member of our party asked for a refill on his Pepsi; she took his glass and disappeared for another ten minutes. After flagging her down and politely asking about it, she huffily replied that she was ""getting to it"".  But we didn't complain until she messed up the checks. We asked for separate checks and with each one the initial check she brought out differed from the credit card receipt--in one case the credit card receipt had a balance that was ten dollars more than the initial check.

Sarah K.,"Manhattan, NY",103,282,27,1.0,1/18/2009,"I have been to this Applebee's 3 times since it opened up in December.  The first time was for birthday drinks after class, since it's right next to school.  I got the tiniest whiskey and coke for about $9 and the martini my friend got was equally as tiny for a similar price.  I know we're in NYC, but we're in Flatbush, and I'm sure the rent here is not as expensive as Midtown. The second time I had lunch with a classmate and was hungry enough and desiring a beer enough to let him convince me to go to Applebee's.  Our waiter was very nice, but he was obviously very new to waiting tables.  I ordered American cheese on my burger but when it arrived, it had cheddar.  I was surprised it was incorrect because our waiter seemed to triple-check everything.  Not that I detest cheddar cheese or anything, but it just looks unappetizing when it's melted to me. We asked our waiter after we were done if there was a happy hour, because I thought I heard they sort-of had one from 10pm till closing.  He then told us, oh well it's going on right now, but you have to sit by the bar.  It's half price for certain beers only, 3-6pm and 10pm-close.  I think that's it.  The Applebee's I lived near a few years ago in Boston had half-price appetizers and drinks every night after 9.  I think that's a way better deal. The third time I went with a friend who wanted to try it out, and again I was persuaded to join because I had been at school working for a little too long and was starving.  We ordered off the lunch menu - it is a 'pick a pair' setup.  The restaurant was almost empty.  Our waiter seemed to be the only person waiting tables, however, and it took quite some time for our drinks and our food to come.  I had decided to get soup and the grilled cheese BLT, which comes with chipotle mayo and I asked for it on the side so I wouldn't have like a pound of mayo on my sandwich.  When it arrived, my sandwich consisted of 3 slices of bread, 2 on the bottom one on top, and a regular BLT.  I didn't notice this till after the waiter disappeared and we didn't have the time for me to flag someone down and ask for my food to be redone.  Afterward I explained to the waiter that my GRILLED CHEESE BLT didn't have any cheese on it, and the side of mayo that I got wasn't the Chipotle mayo that it came with.  That was the deciding factor in me choosing that sandwich so I was a bit disappointed.  He then said the cook didn't quite understand him when he put in the order.  I just don't understand how a cook can forget the cheese on a grilled cheese sandwich.  We finally got our bill and had to run out of there, so we didn't make a fuss, but it would've been nice to have the bill reflect that I didn't get what I ordered.  I guess next time I'm in a restaurant I'll have to make sure to get someone's attention right away if my order is wrong rather than just eating what I'm given to save time.   I won't be back at this Applebee's.  It's let me down 3 times.  I know it's new, but 3 strikes and you're out I guess.  I really wanted to like it too, because it's practically on campus.  Well now that I don't want to go back, I'll probably save some $$ by just going to the Halal cart on Campus Rd instead when I need a quick lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17?start=100

Delano R.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,19,1,1.0,6/27/2017,"If I could leave zero stars I would.  Seating was pretty quick.   However once we sat down the shit started.  Ordered three separate drinks from the bar in successsion...none of them were made.  No mint, no ginger, can't make the other drink for some other reason.  Ordered the fourth and they say well we can make the mule for you.  Worst drink ever.  Super sour.  Bitter gross.   Appetizers were hands down the best thing to happen to me all day!   Just before we finished the last two wings, the server asked us to grab the last couple of wings off the plate so he could clear it.   As for the meals....we were a party of seven....not one meal was edible.  We all got our food around the same time....but that's is when the disappointment rained down on our table...with a might vengance.  Server brought the manager over to swap out my plate....no apology, waited another 25 min and the original server brought out my replacement meal.  No check from manager....just a drop of the food.  I don't blame the server.  Wesley did his best...but I completely blame the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17
Kevin C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",32,117,159,3.0,4/27/2017,Im not the biggest fan of apple bees. I came for a quick lunch meal. I was at work. I came with somebody from work who i take care of. He really enjoyed the food. The customer service was great. I came with someone in a wheel chair and they gave us the perfect seating.the food was ok It was made fresh. Im just not into apple bees like that anymore. However my experience here was better than previous times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17

Julie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,15,,2.0,10/8/2016,"The food at this place is decent, I suppose the same as at any other Applebee's, but the service, my god, the service. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or what (but then, like... why??), but everything with these people takes half an hour. After you are seated, you have to wait half an hour before someone actually takes your order. After they bring your order they don't check on you, even if it's been a while and you are finished eating.  I was there once on a date, and our waitress passed our table several times without making eye contact - we had to flag her down to ask her to take the dirty dishes away. Another time I was there by myself, I needed to ask my waitress for something, and she just kept walking as I was talking to her! I mean, she turned her head to listen to me, but she didn't stop, and I had to rush the words. Really, are these people trained in customer service AT ALL?? And I suppose basic common sense is not a strong suit with the people who work there, either... Then you have to wait half an hour for your check, then they take half an hour to come back and take your credit card - you get the picture. Once I was paying with cash, and no one even came back to check if I needed change - once again, I had to flag someone down to ask for it. At least twice that I was at that Applebee's I or my date only tipped 10% because the service was just so unsatisfactory. Unfortunately there are very few restaurants within walking distance of my house, and that's the only reason I ever go there in the first place. P.S.: by the way, I once called them to inquire if they have a Sunday brunch menu. The girl who answered the phone did not know what ""brunch"" was. This was an English-speaking young woman. I was astonished that someone in the food industry could be unfamiliar with the concept of brunch, but I guess given the level of service there it's par for the course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17
Sha'velle D.,"Queens, NY",383,19,72,1.0,10/14/2017,"Let's talk about false advertisements I came here this evening with my expectations with a party of 6 including myself. What do we expect from Nostrand avenues Applebee's. Let me begin with the false advertisement of the $1 margaritas  after we googled this location and it was stated on Applebee's website that this location specifically had that special. We are told that only Coney Island and upstate new york are offering that. I asked to speak to a manager about this and no one ever came. We decided after such a long drive we might as well just eat anyway. After ordering our meals my friend and I had the 2 for $20 in which we order spinach dip as a appetizer, I had the blackened salmon with mash potatoes and broccoli and she had the chicken tenders with fries. We also ordered a two additional chicken tender orders one for a child and one an adult. The adults were shorted of their chicken tenders by one as if we wouldn't notice. We received all of our appetizers after we nearly completed our entrees. The service was definitely lacking in the effort to satisfy us the customers. I don't think we'll ever return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17
Mike J.,"New York, NY",0,10,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Omg idk what to really say, the food takes forever to come out that's one and the place is really dirty and the menus are really dirty they meet to be washed with hot water or need to to be wiped down",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17
Issac L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12,61,21,4.0,5/7/2017,"Ate here only once back in 2012, I got the food to go but while waiting i ordered a few drinks ... I enjoyed the food once I got home and the alcohilic drinks were surprisingly strong and not watered down garbage like most places. It seems to draw a continuous crowd so it must be a go to place for people looking to dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17
Marie Ernande J.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,"My friend and I walked into Applebee's and we were told the wait is 20 minutes. We said we were ok with the wait.  The wait was 35 minutes long. We were escorted to a table; the booth was wet with water. I wiped it out because I didn't want it to take another 35 minutes. The waiter came to our table to take the order. We gave our order and 10 minutes later he came to ask us what was our drinks. We gave him the order again. He brought the drinks and the drinks had no taste. Our entree came 20 minutes later with no knives uto cut the steak and chicken breast we ordered. When I asked the waiter about our appetizer, he said he didn't know what happened to the appetizer but he's still waiting for the mash potatoes. I was extremely disappointed with the service and the drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brooklyn-17
