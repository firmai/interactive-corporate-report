ED D.,"Rockwell, AR",113,241,115,5.0,12/29/2017,"This place is the bomb. Yes, they might have a dirty kitchen, it's prob a given. The service might not be awesome, then you aren't sitting in the bar. So if you aren't sitting in the bar...why you at chili's?  For HS, this place is a gold mine of cold beer and TVs.  I love this place! The food is par AF, but you know this man!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Jessie B.,"Leander, TX",2,75,26,2.0,12/19/2017,The food was good. Had Sky for a server. I ordered the 3 meat platter and later requested a to go box for the left overs. Left the table and headed off without the box. Hadn't left the building before realizing and sent the wife back for it. Bus girl  had already thrown it away without making any effort to catch us. Zilch customer care in my opinion,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Michael L.,"Mena, AR",5,1,,1.0,4/30/2017,Terrible experience... Everything was old and crusty.. I've never had a worse experience at a restaurant...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Christina S.,"San Francisco, CA",44,35,4,4.0,11/22/2016,I saw all of the bad reviews but after a few horrible meals including hair in my breakfast at a local diner I figured a chain restaurant might be safer. I'm a bit of a food snob but our meals were actually really good. We both ordered salads that were fresh and the bartender was very friendly and attentive. Not amazing fall off your chair food but definitely better than anything we have had in the last 3 days in Hot Springs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Vicki B.,"Spring, TX",36,75,28,3.0,8/10/2015,"We stopped at Chili's tonight to celebrate my birthday, as well as my husband's birthday. We expected to be served in a reasonable amount of time, and to get our order without any mistakes or mixups.  Unfortunately, that isn't what occurred. Even making allowances for servers and cooks in training, it took more than twice as long for our order to arrive. The servers in training were rude. The cooks completely forgot to make my husband's food.  The veteran server did not clear our table as requested, and was slow in refilling drinks.  It's as if this restaurant is running without a manager.  I give 3 stars because the food was cooked properly. And because the veteran server comped us for my husband's meal. We had to cancel our order for dessert.  Not my idea of a happy birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Jim D.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",0,10,,1.0,6/4/2017,Was unable to eat here tonight. Love their honey chipotle ribs but ask to see the pic 3 menu to see what my choices were and it was never brought to me. Server returned to take order and I informed him was still waiting on menu. When he returned the menu was tossed on the table with a grunt...Asked to see the manager. Informed her of the attitude of her server and came to Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Nancy M.,"Arkadelphia, AR",0,6,,4.0,11/22/2016,"The meal was overall great along with the cheesecake! I had two people with me and both of them said they loved the food they ordered. Chili's staff were very nice and willing to help. After we ordered I timed how long it would take to get the meal out for three people and it took about 18 minutes! Which it is not 20 minutes which would have made me leave. Also the dessert Only took 3 minutes to get out. The bathroom was average, although the floors had paper towels on the them. The Kitchen floor was truly dirty, but no one is going to eat there. They also had a Ziosk, which was pretty cool. You could play games on it, order on it, and even pay on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Angel A.,"Tampa, FL",19,47,568,3.0,7/4/2015,"We had my regular fajita...we did a double steak and shrimp.  Southwest egg rolls and honey boneless wings.  Flavor on wings is fabulous, but the term ""boneless wing"" is not accurate.   It's more like a chicken nugget.  We also ordered the smoked wings (with bones).  The bbq dipping sauce is really good.  Not busy or loud today.  Our server, Jeff, was great.  My review lost 1 star because of the boneless wings.  They really are tiny flavorful nuggets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Steve J.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,2.0,10/23/2015,"We have been on the road for the last two years, and found this Chili's to be the worst one we have visited. The menus in our bar booths were covered with grease and other things. It was a hour into the lunch period and they were out of the potato soup. The rest of the meal wasn't up to the usually high Chili's standards. We have visited Chili's all across the states.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
R M.,"Jones Mill, AR",0,1,1,1.0,9/20/2013,We just left b/c the two idiots working the lounge couldn't decide who was supposed to wait on the two of us. We took our $50 and $15 tip to Outback!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Kristi C.,"Hot Springs, AR",34,169,877,4.0,9/17/2011,"The Chicken Club tacos with black bean & rice is my favorite. The burgers are really good too. Try the mango frozen margarita, yummy. Hubby like the ribs, they taste like their off the grill. We enjoy eating the bar more lively and watching the football games.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Charles D.,"Lake Hamilton, AR",13,47,4,1.0,1/9/2015,Watch out for the half tattooed bartender guy for the Friday lunch shift. He loves to chat and not do his job :((  I just left after five minutes of no drink.  I should have brought my own tea.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Clint S.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",0,2,,3.0,2/8/2016,Our waitress's jacket she was wearing had dog hair all over it and smelt like cigarettes....pretty disgusting! The children's high chairs were also filthy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Nathan P.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",55,81,,5.0,11/19/2014,Ate the two for $20 chicken fajitas. It was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in Hot Springs. The chicken fajitas were absolutely delicious. You get PLENTY of food and flavor for the price (their salsa appetizer on the two for $20 is delicious as well). The restaurant is clean and the background music is pleasant without being distracting. Our server Renee was excellent and even gave us stuff we needed before even asking. I had a fantastic time and can't wait to go back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Brandy L.,"Stoughton, WI",0,75,25,1.0,9/16/2014,This is the worse Chilli's I have ever been to. We had a party of 13. We ordered 3 of Chilli's famous Quesos. They were cold and watered down. It was gross. We sent them all back and canceled 1 order. The waitress brought back 2 hot Quesos that were still watered down. We were informed that the queso was fresh that's why it looked like liquid poop. I have ordered the queso many times in the past 20 years. Never have I seen it look like water. My sister ordered a Santa Fe grilled chicken salad. The chunks of ice burg lettuce were brown. More than half of the salad had brown lettuce. She picked around it and ate the salad. We were starving and had somewhere to be. So she didn't send it back. We were very disappointed in the food. I looked on Chilli's website and corporate to try and let them know about the food. I couldn't find even an email address for the manager of the store.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Amber M.,"Memphis, TN",79,210,34,4.0,9/26/2013,This chilis was great in some aspects and not in others. Its to be expected from a chilis. The burgers were charred and bread was hard as a rock... but the nachos and potato skins were extremely good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
Joshua T.,"South Padre Island, TX",65,22,1,4.0,10/30/2012,"It's Chili's. I give this one four stars because the service here has always been good for me. I usually eat the ribs or the honey chicken crispers, good stuff. The drinks off of their bar are pretty good, but the reason this gets a four star over a three (standard for chains for me) is their service, and their hours are decent on weekdays to accommodate those that like to eat after nine. That's a rare quality here, but don't go too late, or you'll be stuck with that crapple down the road (if you get my drift).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
michelle f.,"Denton, TX",8,37,,2.0,8/19/2011,"Alright...i'm not rating chilis in general...you know what it is...chain food, whatever.  I needed a place for lunch to balance my calories out for my little weekend getaway.  I wanted to eat something that listed the calories for me and that usually means eating at a chain.  I found myself at chilis having the old guiltless grill chicken sandwich.  I just wanted to rate this particular chilis and say that it is one unorganized mess.  The service was crazy and my order was totally messed up.  My server was very polite but a little absentee.  As a solo diner, i had nothing to do but watch other tables and everyone seemed to be getting bad service even though the restaurant was about 20 percent occupied. One large group waited so long for a server to come back with their drinks that they had time to write down their entire order for him to make it easier on him.   I would give it one star but i don't know, maybe it was just a really frazzled off day for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hot-springs-3
