Justin E.,"Mequon, WI",26,149,202,4.0,2/28/2011,"For the most part, I always enjoy my experience at Chili's. Meal was good, service was good, military discount was less than 10%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3?start=20

Becky S.,"Milwaukee, WI",113,223,22,2.0,2/4/2012,"Meh. Chili's is okay. This isn't a place I go to too frequently, but we had a gift certificate to use. It took a while for someone to come and greet and seat us, even though they weren't too busy. Our waitress was literally frowning and scowling and looked like she'd rather be anywhere else in the world. We took advantage of the $20 deal which includes one appetizer and two meals, which is a pretty decent deal. Food was adequate and tasty enough, but service was lackluster, and Chili's really isn't one of my favorite chains. We won't be rushing to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3?start=20
Judy M.,"Germantown, WI",6,2,,4.0,1/9/2014,"Tonight my husband and I had a delicious meal. We enjoyed the 2 for $20 special. I had the wonderful grilled chicken salad and my husband had the new chipotle butter sirloin.  We chose chips and guacamole as our appetizer. Our meals were very tasty.  My only complaint is when I asked our server about the senior discount at the beginning of our visit, she was unaware of any.  She knew of the military discount and a birthday special.  I requested she check it out. I was told there is a 10% senior discount on more than one occasion and on many websites.  Our server did not check it out and we received no senior discount. However, our meal was great and our server was very attentive (other than checking for the discount). I will return. But I do want to clarify if there is a discount for seniors or not before I return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3?start=20

Mark P.,"Milwaukee, WI",258,285,532,4.0,11/23/2017,"So you don't like Chili's? Why? Honestly? Because it fits in with Applebees, Fridays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Bennigandays & all the neighborhood-bar-n-grill chain ilk? But have you BEEN, though? Because I have.  I've see the mountains of babyback ribs. I've braved the appetizer trio. I've heard the sizzle of fajitas for two on a hot platter, shrimp, beef & chicken coming together as one.  I've ordered extra ranch & downed obnoxious margaritas big enough to baptize a baby in. The menu is an encyclopedia of American food with an appendix on Tex-Mex. It's hilarious in both scope & Michael Bay's approach to sensory overload. The place is packed every night of the week, even with a dozen high quality restaurants serving similar fare nearby. Order apps, margs & some ridiculous entrée. Instagram pictures because it's probably going to be the most interesting thing your scrolling friend notices among artisan donuts & #fitness gym selfies. A star subtracted because the tablets at each table are lame as hell. Let the servers serve. Also, getting rid of your busboys is a weird move. Too many tables left dirty for far too long. But anyways, if you haven't been in a while, get to Chili's & eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Jason L.,"Stoddard, WI",13,13,,4.0,10/3/2017,"Good food, I had the old timers cheese burger with cheese. The service was fast and friendly even since we showed up 15min before closing due to traveling for work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Andrew G.,"Germantown, WI",25,62,35,5.0,1/2/2017,"My visits at Chilis were sublime and the food was delicious as always. I would highly recommend the Big Mouth Bites, Boneless Wings and Southern Egg rolls for the Triple Dipper Meal. The service was great and the staff was very friendly. Also they have special deals including happy hour and many selections of meals at reasonable prices. I would definitely come back to Chili's for any special occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Matthew V.,"Hartford, WI",118,30,40,2.0,10/10/2014,"Not too impressed today. My family and I have been here several times before. For some reason we must have caught them with their pants down today.  It took 10+ minutes to become acknowledged as a customer once we were seated at our table. And once we were acknowledged, she'd be with us in a moment. The restaurant wasn't busy enough to warrant such a response. Needless to say, we're not off to a good start here. The meal didn't really finish with a flare, either. Our waitstaff checked in with us maybe once. On the plus-side, you can get and pay your check right at the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Max C.,"Richfield, WI",2,12,,5.0,5/24/2016,"Fairly basic menu, but with Chilis it doesn't matter. However, the variety is just ok. Lets get to the food: Tasty, served exactly at specific temperature it is supposed to be at, comes out fairly fast. I am pleased with this restaurant, delicious sides and sauces. Desserts at Chilis are also very good like the chocolate molten cake with ice cream on top. The Burger deal with unlimited fries for 5 or 6 bucks is a good deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Breanna T.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,18,6,1.0,1/1/2016,"Table side guacamole was a joke! Everything was brought out on a serving tray pre cut and just added to a bowel.  Very flavorless and small portion. Once our entrées came out they were cold and just didn't taste good.  Service was blah,  not very attentive. I'll be just fine with never coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Jessica K.,"Germantown, WI",22,22,1,1.0,10/18/2014,"One of the male managers became combative when I asked to switch out the appetizer on the 2 for $20 for 2 soups (as other managers have readily okayed considering the fact that I have Celiac disease and can't eat any of their appetizers)  He didn't seem to know what I was talking about so I asked him ""Do you even know what Celiac Disease is?"" to which he replied ""No."" I paid for our drinks and left because I didn't feel safe eating there at that point.  Unfortunately I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Tom D.,"Venice, FL",0,2,2,1.0,11/23/2015,"My wife and I ate here on a Monday night. The food took forever to be delivered.  When it was finally delivered, they got half of my order wrong. The manager offered some nachos because the kitchen was so slow. The manager also offered to reduce the bill. But when the bill arrived, the bill was at the full price. Told waitress, she talked to manager, who finally adjusted bill. Although food was slow arriving, it tasted good.  The waitress disappeared for a long periods of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Marissa B.,"Oak Creek, WI",1,28,,3.0,11/18/2014,Service was fast and efficient but very cold. I was unimpressed with the tiny portion we had compared to how it normally seems. It was extremely underwhelming.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Jana S.,"Menomonee Falls, WI",6,10,3,4.0,9/17/2014,Dine here every so often. Service is generally good and the food is better than Applebee's. Our favorite server is Alex. Be sure to ask for him. If you check in with the app four square you get a free chips and salsa appetizer. Food is priced right for what you get. We will keep going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Jenni K.,"Butler, WI",35,17,,2.0,9/8/2015,"My family and I have gone to this Chili's many times. We went last night for dinner and it was complete different than any other time we've ever gone. We were seated at a table that was not wiped down. We had to ask for it to be cleaned, the waitress asked for our drink order and then brought the drinks to the table one at a time. We ordered a beer, soda and a child's milk. The waitress came back 10 minutes later to take our order, which we thought was a really long time. Our food came and I was not happy with my salad, it was very watery and didn't look fresh at all. I wanted to have it sent back but our waitress never came back to ask us how we were doing. We were looking for her and saw she was on her cell phone talking on it by the bathrooms. At this point we were just done. We tried to pay on the tablet they have at the table but ours was broken. The waitress came to give us our bill and we asked for a box. She came back to run our card but no box. Came back for me to sign the receipt and no box. We asked again and she took 5 minutes to return with a box. We will go back but will request not to be seated in her section. There was no reason for her to be so slow. The restaurant was not busy at all. Also, I won't get that salad again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Jeff G.,"Cedarburg, WI",0,63,35,3.0,3/25/2012,"First time at this Chili's location in Germantown as we had a gift certificate.  The restaurant was clean and appeared to be well organized. I had a bacon burger, my wife had a chicken fajita.  We both had a draft beer.  I ordered my burger medium and it came out a bit under that but not too far off.  I would have liked it a bit more cooked however.  I did not send it back, as you know what can happen in the kitchen when they have a complaint.  It was tasty and the french fries were also good so I ate it, as is.  My wife enjoyed her chicken fajita.   Overall, the food portions were adequate for the price.  My burger was around a 1/2 pound of beef.  The beef did not have much flavor or seasoning to it. The diner experience was what I expected it to be.  We don't frequent Chili's that often so it will be a while until we come back.  There is just nothing on the menu to pull you back as a repeat customer. Waitress was attentive, but did not know the menu very well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Ken M.,"Norton Shores, MI",12,77,,3.0,5/27/2014,"Fast seating, excellent service, very nice waitress....food today was just so-so. Fries were not warm, chicken crispers were luke warm not hot....everything else was very good and well done!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Damon S.,"Jefferson, WI",68,67,10,3.0,3/9/2014,"I've been going to Chili's in Germantown for years. This location is always clean, and the service is usually pretty good. It's the standard Chili's food that they have at every location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Tim T.,"Germantown, WI",70,24,1,4.0,9/2/2011,"My visits to chilis are common. I appreciate how my order has always been correct, cooked perfectly, and the service has been outstanding every time.  Sometimes a burger is greasy, or my drinks aren't refilled at my preference, but I am taken care of here, and I will continue to return again and again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Angela S.,"Milwaukee, WI",53,98,,4.0,3/7/2014,"Love there chips, salsa,and tortilla soup. They have now added more Mexican food to there menu which is very yummy- shrimp tacos, and enchiladas, etc. The margaritas were very good also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Calla M.,"Jackson, WI",1,2,,5.0,8/5/2015,Our good was as good as it gets. I had a turkey burger that was so juicy with flavor the best I've had in a while. My husband loved his big mouths and y the fries are fantastic. Service was outstanding,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Geoffrey R.,"Milwaukee, WI",47,100,5,3.0,3/30/2012,"Chili's of Germantown was about the same as Chili's in Florida. The food is consistent and their decor never changes. Normally when i eat here i grab one of their giant burgers or fajita's, but this time i was feeling a bit more adventurous. So i ordered their half rack of Memphis dry rubbed ribs. The rub was great, the ribs were cooked decent however i felt like i was on a diet. What meat there was on the ribs wasn't substantial enough to feel full after the meal. Thank god they had french fries or i would of really felt like i missed something. So if your looking for good burgers and fajita's, check out Chili's. If you want ribs, go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
Kathy H.,"Germantown, WI",5,20,2,5.0,5/31/2014,Our waitress was awesome! She was very nice and polite! We just came for desert but it amazing.  I will definitely go there again!

Lacey B.,"Milwaukee, WI",43,70,,4.0,9/16/2011,"""Chili's is the new golf course, it's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine."" -Michael Scott What can I say about Chili's that hasn't been said before? Generally tasty food, reasonable prices, and usually good service. I just ate at Chili's for dinner tonight. My boyfriend and I ordered from the 2 for $20 menu, I got the Fried Shrimp and fries and he got the Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers and fries. With this, we also got an appetizer- chips, guacamole and salsa. All was delicious. For those that don't know, Chili's salsa isn't the most authentic, but it is very, very delicious. The server was very good, bringing food out promptly, yet giving us enough time to finish our appetizer before bringing our meals. She was even attentive to our 2-year-old daughter, offering to refill her sippy cup with milk, free of charge. Aside from what we ordered on this visit, Chili's has some great things on their menu. I'm partial to their Chicken Enchilada Soup (something that wasn't on their menu for the longest time, you had to ask for it specifically) and their Country Fried Steak (delicious, but a real artery clogger). There are definitely some things that I wouldn't order at chili's. For instance, anything that comes with bacon strips (their strips are so thick that the texture and taste of the rest of the meal is overwhelmed.) Or some of their more strange dishes like Bacon Ranch Quesadillas. Also, don't expect to be seated right away (or even find a parking spot)  if you show up for dinner at 7pm, any day of the week. They get packed around dinner time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-3
