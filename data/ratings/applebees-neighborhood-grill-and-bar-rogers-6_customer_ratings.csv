10,Jonathan B.,"Brainerd, MN",1,9,3.0,4.0,2015-09-03,"My first visit to Applebee's in Rogers. I came in with a couple of friends and ordered my favorite, the Quesadilla burger.  Our waitress Hannah was friendly and food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. The manager did not pay us a visit must have been busy. I def would come back again if in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
7,Chris O.,"Plantation, FL",13,35,6.0,1.0,2015-11-02,"This place has No Vibe, a boring bartender ""Lynn"", and if you want personality.. Bring affirms to talk too cause she won't even look at you... Atmosphere is cool as far as decorations but no vibe or friendly personality... !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
9,Mike D.,"Clear Lake, MN",12,3,,1.0,2015-11-17,We walked in at 11:45 am. Nobody  around.  Seated ourselves.  Waited 5 minutes  for a menu.  And another  5 for our waitress.  Another 5 for our drink. Our margareta's  on the rocks had pulp floating  in it and my wife's straw had greasy slime on it also no salt on the rim. Sent it back and walked out. Applebee's  in st. Cloud is a 5 star. Never  going back to Rogers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,

4,Kevin T.,"Rogers, MN",53,87,1.0,2.0,2016-02-21,"Global chains have their advantages. You can go into a global chain anywhere in the world and more or less get the same meal.  Applebee's is no different, they are consistent.  Consitantly disappointing.   Our intent was to go to a local chain restaurant, however their 40 min wait and our young family was incompatible at the time, so to save our suffering, and the suffering of everyone else in the restaurant, we opted for the chain restaurant with no wait, Applebee's  The decor of the place was refreshingly local, the restaurant was clean, and the staff was friendly...   Thats more or less where the positive experience of the restaurant ends.   Lets start with the alcohol.   The draft beer selection was nothing but a massive disappointment.  Applebee's had Macrobrewery ""light"" beer on tap mainly with some of the macrobreweries attempts to pan handle a massed produced swill as a micro.  I don't consider Sam Adams a microbrewery any longer.  MN has so many great microbreweries with kegging capability, why not display some of the talents of local brewers to match the local nature of the restaurants decor?  My wife had a long island lce tea which I have found to be over iced, underpoured, and missing some the clear liquors a proper long island ice tea should have.   For dinner we did to the 2 for $20/25.  My wife had the Fiesta Lime Chicken.   This item has been on Applebee's menu for more than 20 years with a name change or two along the way, its also one of the few items worth ordering again in my opinion.  While the chicken was tasty, the rice, as usual left a lot to be desired.   I decided to venture away from the well worn path of Fiesta Lime chicken and tried what turned out to be a bland, calorie bomb that is the 4 cheese mac and cheese with ""honey pepper"" chicken.   Initial presentation was sad at best.  Missing was the creamy four cheese blend I was expecting.  The small shriveled, fried chicken tenders were greasy mostly breading, apparently tossed in what turned out to be the oily ""honey pepper"" sauce.   The whole mess then had bacon sprinkled on top.  Bacon should have been this dish's saving grace.  Bacon is a little like sex, even when it's bad, it's still pretty good, but this bacon must have had all of bacon's goodness tortured out, not unlike Theon Greyjoy from the Game of Thrones, having been tortured until he broke.    At first bite the mac and cheese was bland in both flavor at texture.  There was a sweet flavor that must have been the honey pepper sauce but the honey and pepper flavors were notable missing in action in this culinary genocide.  The four cheeses?  Where's the cheese?  Even stale cold kraft mac and cheese had more cheese than this dish.    Salt and pepper shakers should be used to slightly adjust a meal to the consumers liking, in this case they were used in combination with copious quantities of tabasco in the attempt to bring life back into whatever this dish was supposed to be.   While the food left a lot to be desired, the staff was friendly and attentive.  While it will likely be a few years, I am sure I will return to applebees one day to be disappointed again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
6,J W.,"Newnan, GA",0,203,13.0,3.0,2016-04-14,Order the half rack of ribs and even though they are not smoke the flavor was good but there was very little meat on the bones. I usually have a half rack at famous daves and take some home. These I went away hungry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
5,Mason B.,"Ames, IA",11,13,,1.0,2016-07-24,"Surprised by customers on a Friday at 6pm! Not enough staff to handle average crowd. We were seated right away then waited 20 minutes for water and an hour for salads and chicken strips. Salads were warm and chicken cold. Bar back was training new bartender, waiting tables and monitoring host staff. Many empty tables but people waiting 30 min for a seat. Caesar salads had corn bread croutons and some sort of watery mayo dressing NOT a Caesar salad and some weird cheese. I think a chef in training in kitchen. With all the other choices nearby I would pass on this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
2,Roy A.,"Memphis, IN",21,24,,1.0,2017-04-19,"Way over cooked food. I ate there twice. The first was salmon, it was disgraceful! The second was bourbon chicken, when it came out you could smell the burn! Just awful, I will never return to this Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
3,Caroline L.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,7,,5.0,2017-06-01,"I love this place. It's so cozy and the service is so friendly. Try their happy hour...it's twice a day. And I love Burger Monday, phenomenal prices!! Pitchers too!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
1,Paul S.,"Rogers, MN",1,60,3.0,1.0,2017-08-10,"Why does this place continue to provide such poor service. The food is decent but management clearly has no control over this place. Consistently we don't ever see our server to even greet us for 5+ minutes. Got seated next to Applebee's employees that just got done with their shift and it was a party between workers clocked in and out, very unprofessional. Not surprised there was an article online that they are closing 100+ stores.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-6,,,,,
