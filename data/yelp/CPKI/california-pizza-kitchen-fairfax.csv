mimi t.,"Centreville, VA",8,41,,3.0,7/5/2017,"I had my 2 older kids playing at the fountain today. I decided to try their app for the convenience and it was perfect. the kids and I walked over when the food was ready. I haven't had cpk in about 2 or 3 years and loved that I could get a small pizza with a nice sized salad. the pizza choices for the kids meal was great. we ordered Hawaiian and the mushroom with sausage. kids loved it.  I didn't give this place 5 stars bc of the hostesses. when I came up I figured they didn't see me in time to help with the second set of doors. I had 3 children total, 2 in a stroller. but when I asked again where the takeout counter was they seemed annoyed with me. then when I left they didn't offer to help with any doors and this time I was carrying a bag and a drink caddy. there were 2 hostesses doing nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Ray F.,"Springfield, VA",3,16,37,5.0,2/25/2017,Kaylee is the best server! Our food arrived promptly and accurately. Elvis is a master pizza chef . My BBQ pizza had bright flavors and a zesty sauce ! Yum !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Sheila H.,"Vienna, VA",354,42,88,4.0,6/19/2016,"This was my first time at CPK and the service was great! Our server was friendly and not intrusive at all. We went for dinner on a Saturday night and our food came quickly. We ordered the California club and the Spinach and Artichoke with extra chicken. The pizzas came in fresh, hot and bothered. Delicious! However, my only complaint was that the pizza was a little too salty, especially the bacon on the California club. I felt dehydrated for the rest of the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Umer M.,"Fairfax, VA",70,1,,5.0,7/19/2017,Only been there once and the service was impeccable. My waiter was Anthony and I couldn't have asked for a better one. Very respectful and attentive. Made conversation but not too much to the point where it was annoying. If I go again I'll definitely want him to be server again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Crystal X.,"Fairfax, VA",191,110,552,2.0,2/27/2016,"Meh. Came here for dinner because I had finished a hot yoga class with my friend and this CPK was conveniently situated right across the street. The food is mediocre and not half as good as I remembered it to be back in my high school days (at least five years ago? wow). Anyway, my Spicy Chipotle Pizza was like a promising first date that quickly headed southward... while the flavors were there and the colorful toppings added a kick of spice to the pizza, the dough was completely soggy in the middle. I couldn't pick up a slice of pizza without the whole thing falling apart! I ended up eating with a fork and knife. Service was attentive and our glasses were always filled with water but that didn't matter as much to me when the food was so disappointing. Who wants to pay $13-14 excluding tip for a soggy pizza? Not me. For a pizza chain, it's imperative to get your pizzas right! Considering all the other options in this area, I wouldn't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20

Tina T.,"Fairfax, VA",312,312,152,3.0,2/18/2016,"CPK is mediocre imo and looking at the crowd during the time I went for lunch confirmed that. There were teenagers and kids everywhere I turned (granted it was a holiday and a school closure). It definitely reminded me of all the times I used to go to CPK when I was a teenager and thought the food was awesome. I got the lunch special of BBQ chicken pizza and Mediterranean salad and it was just alright. Nothing really satisfying about it, but for lunch is ok...  Our waiter was very tentative and nice though, so that compsenated for the bland food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20

Wendy K.,"Fairfax, VA",0,2,,1.0,5/11/2017,Ordered delivery and they completely messed up order.  The poor driver had to come in and go order by order with me and call them three times to get help.  He went back to get rest of order and the manager game him a hard time took him an hour to go and pick up two sandwiches- ridiculous!

Trinity P.,"Woodbridge, VA",7,52,25,5.0,10/30/2015,"Great service on a busy Friday night, yummy food & the strawberry basil margarita is ahhhhhmazing! I had 2 and could have had 5 more but I'm a classy lady lol :) we had the guac and corn with chips as an appetizer - my fave every time. The yellow corn is sweet and rounds out the flavor of the guac nicely. He had the Sicilian pizza and loved every single bite!! I had the Moroccan spiced chicken and although it was a teensy bit over dressed, I still really enjoyed it. Dates and butternut squash really made the salad and ""spiced"" doesn't mean spicy, which is good. We ended with the butter cake (no judgement, please!!)  The manager was on site checking on everyone and she served my second drink. That was very nice, even told us the recipe and chatted a bit :) the seating in the front area is pretty tight so we got to know the ladies beside us :) CPK has been one of my fave spots for years and I still highly recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Ted M.,"Manassas, VA",81,48,458,4.0,5/18/2016,"It's been a long time since I've been here and keep wondering what has kept me away?  However,  I was pleasantly surprised and happy we did stop.  Our party of three stopped after a 6:30 movie, so it was close to 9:00pm on a Friday night when we arrived.  We were promptly greeted with smiles and were seated immediately.  Our waitress (I'm sorry I forgot her name) was stellar and catered to our every whim for the next hour.  The menu was substantial and offered many details, including what wine pairs with that entrée.  I had a hard time choosing what I wanted as there were so many dishes I wanted to try.  We tried the Mahi Mahi Tacos which were full of flavor and the roasted salsa was delicious.  On top of the panko crusted mahi, they used a sriracha ranch, fresh cilantro, cabbage and avocado slices - delicious!  I tried the Hearth-Roasted Halibut, and it was amazing!  It was cooked on a cedar plank and laid on top of asparagus, squash faro and kale.  It was bursting with flavors.  Lastly, we ordered a kids meal of grilled chicken and pasta. Unfortunately, the chicken was dry and the pasta was over cooked.  The kids meal is what prevented that 5th star.   I will definitely make plans to come back soon and explore this menu, and let's not forget to mention this is a budget friendly restaurant too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Abigail G.,"Fairfax, VA",2,19,3,1.0,3/15/2017,"Update: -1 star. It turns out they comped one entree, but then charged an extra one. I guess we were in such a rush to catch our movie last night that we missed it. Nice try, CPK. Nice try. Definitely lost a few customers now... **************** Needs improvement. Manager said they were short staffed tonight and I can understand that, but what I can't understand is why the tables next to and behind us (both arrived later and therefore placed their orders later) managed to get their food before our table. Possibly because our server forgot my order and didn't actually put it in til much later. Lame. This is why it's helpful to write orders down instead of trying to memorize, especially when you're short staffed.  Then we noticed that my friend's pasta had been sitting out for quite some time. I guess they didn't bring it to our table because they were waiting for our other orders to be ready. The problem with that is by the time it finally got to our table, the pasta was dry and cold. My friend complained and the server tried his best not to show attitude, but eventually he couldnt hide it anymore, gave up and called his manager. She apologized for the wait, comped the cold pasta and refilled our waters (something the server failed to do).  I want to think that maybe we just had a crappy server tonight, but then again...the roasted artichoke and spinach pizza was dry, the garlic cream fettuccine was also dry (and cold), and the spicy buffalo cauliflower's portion size felt more like a $3 plate than the listed $6.99. Oh well...at least the bread was soft.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Lila S.,"Chantilly, VA",0,3,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Just had dinner, worse chicken dish I have ever had. The chicken was tough that I need a steak knife to cut it. I bit in to it and i thought I bit into cartilage...nope the rest of the chicken was as bad. I returned it and the ""manager "" said sorry for the cold chicken...it wasn't cold, it was inedible.  We went to the same restaurant all the time in Colorado and we had good food and serves. Oh, and I was charged for the replacement dish. Do not go there, the manager was pointless. Oh and the hostess mumbled for us to follow her to the table, another hostess had to tells us to follow the first one. When I told her we didn't hear her or understand her, she said ""my bad"", (which drives me crazy). I let her know that it was ""her bad"" and she probably shouldn't address customers that way. Long story short...SAVE your money!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20
Victoria L.,"Herndon, VA",491,535,912,4.0,9/8/2015,"I've been here plenty of times and most of the time it's pretty good. They recently renovated the restaurant and now it has like a farmers feel to it. Nice, big chairs and it feels a bit more spacious. The service is always prompt and attentive when I come. I've never had a problem here before, even gave a guy a 50% tip before because he was just that good. The food has gotten better also! My favorite appetizer is the spinach dip with the warm tortilla chips. Also, the fried mac and cheese bites are good, it's lightly fried with a creamy cheese sauce. The Thai chicken pizza is the best pizza they have and a must try, the secret is to ask for extra peanut sauce so you can pour some more on the pizza. The jamaican jerk pizza is my second favorite with a honey glazed sauce with chicken and ham. It doesn't taste anything ""jamaican"" but its still good. Kung pao noodles with shrimp is spicy but has a great Kung pao sauce and the shrimp is cooked perfectly each time. Their drinks are actually pretty good too, alcoholic and mixed lemonades/teas. Overall, it's a bit pricey for pizza but it's delicious non-the-less. Very family friendly and really great service. I enjoy coming here every once in a while, especially when I'm in Fairfax Corner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20

CPK Wonderful and reliable pizza location, with a surprisingly large menu, which I endeavor to explore in the future. I've had the garlic chicken pizza (not too good, but maybe that's because I don't love garlic...probably not a smart decision 2/5), the Carne Asada pizza (amazing!!! 5/5), the Jamaican jerk chicken (pretty good, 4/5), and the Sicilian thin crust pizza (5/5).

Upma K.,"Herndon, VA",26,16,19,4.0,10/3/2015,"Really good service! In the past, it's always been so-so, but tonight was astounding with the pizza game strong. Their veggie items are always underrated, but the California Veggie Pizza was incredible this evening. I opted for no goat cheese tonight and they still sprinkles the pizza with some mozz. The brocollini is generous, and with the addition of a peppers, a filling veggie meal!  Our server may have forgotten our bread, but was still incredibly attentive and made fantastic recommendations. My parents, uncertain as to what to order, asked for suggestions. The waiter recommended the tostada pizza with regular crust and 'lo and behold, my parents were pleased!  Finally, pumpkin cheesecake is seasonal and good. It's hard to compare it to Cheesecake Factory or Cheesecake Heaven in Warrenton, but it stands well on it's own with lovely presentation and a rich chocolate crust.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20

Minus one star because unfortunately the service here isn't the greatest on a consistent basis.

Lissette G.,"Herndon, VA",19,51,34,5.0,4/13/2016,"BBQ Chicken pizza of course is the best. Their asparagus quinoa salad is really good too, one of the best salads I've ever had actually. Other noteworthy menu items include the sandwiches and tomato basil pizza even that pizza with the avocado on it.

Sarah G.,"Herndon, VA",63,190,63,4.0,11/13/2017,"This was my 1st time trying this CPK and it was pretty good. I got the sausage, mushroom & pepperoni pizza which was good. The pizza came to us nice and hot, the sauce was better than the other chain pizza places (I grew up in an Italian family, nothing compares to grandma's sauce), it was light and tasty. They loaded the pizza with toppings which is good because you're paying $15 for a personal pizza. I also tried a slice of my bf's BBQ chicken pizza and I liked that a lot, not too much sauce or onions. Overall their pizzas have a nice balance of flavor and toppings.  The service was fast and fairly friendly. We went on veterans day, I think they had a discount for veterans and active military. In order to get discounts for something like this you need some kind of valid ID proving you're telling the truth, some customers don't understand that and give the employees a hard time about it. I felt sorry for the employees that had to deal with that, I remember the days of dealing with that working at a movie theater, it's not fun. If you're ever a customer in that situation, be kind the employees are just following policy.  Overall I would come back and try more items on the menu like their veggie pizza (yes I'm a weirdo who likes vegetables on their pizza).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax
Ivy H.,"Chantilly, VA",0,7,11,1.0,8/23/2017,"A friend and I (fans of CPK) walked in on a Tuesday evening excited to grab dinner. The host hesitantly told us there would be a 10-15 min. wait. I was confused because from what I could see, there were 2 booths (4-seaters) and 1 two-person table in plain view that were clearly vacant. ""So, are those seats reserved?"" I asked pointing to the vacant seats. ""Oh, no but we're just going to need a few minutes to set up, etc..*trails off*... so it'll probably be maybe 5 min."" I don't understand. First it was 10-15 min. wait then it was 5 min. - did they simply not want to service us? Is this CPK location seriously so understaffed that they don't have the capacity to seat 2 customers for dinner? To me, this is poor customer service and if it's an issue of being understaffed, then it needs to be addressed by management.  Needless to say, we walked out as there are many other restaurants in Fairfax Corner and lo and behold the very first one we walked into was able to seat us right away, no excuses or issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax
Kristen I.,"Washington, DC",96,89,578,4.0,11/25/2017,"I was craving me some pizza! This place has been consistent with their flavors and decent service. Being located in Fairfax corner, they do have ample parking, but during the dinner rush time, you might have to park a bit far.  Between two of us we ordered: the works pizza on thin crust. Reminds me of papa johns for sure! They do charge extra for making it thin crust... $2? And to keep it somewhat healthy, we ordered quinoa & arugula salad. Love this salad! But I can see some people might not like it as arugula can be a bit bitter. Overall food was freshly made and our server was fairly attentive. I'll be back for more works!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax
Shanique W.,"Woodbridge, VA",22,24,178,5.0,1/6/2018,"Th food here is remarkable! Absolutely loved the Jambalaya Fettuccine, it has a little bit of kick to it but not too overbearing. The Butter Cake is the best I've had so far, still dreaming about it. The restaurant itself is very quaint and everyone there was really nice. There's also a lot to do in the area after lunch/dinner. Perfect for short family outing and well suitable for kids. My daughter loved her Hawaiian bbq Pizza. They were even nice enough to customize it for her. Parking can get a little hectic, as there are many other restaurants/stores around so make sure you're aware of that.

I got the dumpling for an appetizer, which was very delicious as they were nice and soft, and had very good flavor.  There was a nice drizzle ok top with some green onions to garnish.

John K.,"Fairfax, VA",304,379,1882,2.0,9/5/2016,"Saturday found us rushing to Fairfax Corner to make movie time for ""The Tunnel"", which by the way is about a man who gets trapped inside a tunnel after it collapses as he's driving through it. I really would've preferred neighboring Ozzie's, but it was rather busy and we were in a mad rush. No matter, let's get on with this review of the vapid and uninspiring eats at California Pizza Kitchen.  I've been to California Pizza Kitchen all of four times in my entire life and this being the fourth. Two times were at airports when I was either delayed or on a layover and once with a friend for drinks. Perhaps, I can focus on something positive. The host and hostess were very polite and might I dare even nod towards charming? And, this is where it pretty much ends for me. Service *** / ***** Accommodations | Atmosphere **** / ***** Value ** / ***** Spaghetti Bolognese ** / ***** BBQ Chicken Pizza ** / ***** Salmon | Corn Medley *** / ***** Our server was rather humdrum and she spent more time on her phone versus paying attention to her patrons. Unresolved on eating pizza, I impulsively decided on spaghetti. I want to avoid sounding harsh, but the spaghetti was likely on the same level as that served to me and the other 8th grade kids in the cafeteria when I clearly had an immature and less discerning palate. The pizza was dry and boring. No personality other than the pineapples that my good wife asked for. Possibly and just a possibility in that there might have been some redeeming qualities about my daughter's salmon entree. Salmon was tender and cooked through without tasting rubbery, but the corn medley was off the charts in terms of salt. Can't figure out America's infatuation with salt. Price point is contentious here. Food quality doesn't quite chart high enough to justify the prices. You won't burn a hole in your wallet, but there is a disparity in money spent and appeal. Lesson learned. Leave early enough before the movie to dine at an establishment that will deliver in terms of overall value and appeal. Well, it is within a stone's throw of the theatre, but this point alone is not compelling enough to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax
Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, VA",211,594,214,2.0,7/27/2016,"I went to the California Pizza Kitchen for dinner with my husband on 7/21/16.  Before I go into why I not giving the restaurant a higher rating I will say what I liked about the restaurant. I liked the ambiance and, as far as a family friendly restaurant it is a great choice. The service was good. I also think parking and getting to the restaurant is super convenient.  I am not rating the restaurant higher is frankly the cost of the food and the portions you receive. The menu is divided into small bites and appetizers (and when they say ""small bites"" they mean it).  The food options for a pescetarian such as myself are also somewhat limited which was surprised because pizza places are usually very vegetarian friendly. On that note, I ordered a mushroom pizza (one of 2 vegetarian pizzas available) with truffle oil (which by the way has upcharge for a table side portion). It was satisfactory but I didn't feel like it was work coming back for.  It is called California Pizza Kitchen but appears the menu is pushing more pasta and their expensive entrees than actually pizza.  I was also slightly annoyed that I signed up for rewards at an event where they were promoting their food (and started to receive spam) and yet the restaurant had the incorrect information (i.e. showing I had previously been to restaurant and was not entitled to a free appetizer).  In a nutshell, with all the fantastic dining options in the shopping plaza I would only go back to the California Pizza Kitchen if I was in a real pinch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax
Marion D.,"Centreville, VA",0,1,,5.0,12/9/2017,"Before I start my review, I have to apologize to Elli & Jorge that it's taken me so long to write it.  My husband and I have been going to this CPK regularly pretty much since they opened. In all those years, we have always received the most wonderful, friendly, and attentive service. Several servers come by our table just to say hello, even if we're sitting at another server's table. One such server was Elli. She always gave the most amazing and friendly service and came to chat for a few minutes even when she wasn't waitressing our table. Well, Elli is the manager now, and we couldn't be happier for her! She still comes by our table every time she sees us. She has told us that she loves what she does, and it shows!  At our last visit to CPK, Elli told us that one of the chef's, Jorge, had come up with a ceviche pizza for a company-wide competition. She asked if we would like to try it (of course we did!!), so she asked Jorge to bake one of his special pizzas just for us. It was beyond amazing!!! I feel kind of guilty, but my husband and I polished off the entire pizza; we just couldn't stop eating! It certainly proved that Jorge is an excellent chef in his own right who is capable of so much more than just following CPK's recipes. Elli asked Jorge to come to our table so we could thank him personally, and he was so nice; he seemed genuinely happy to hear how much we liked his pizza. Which brings me to the food-part of my review, although I'm sure you could guess by now that we're not regulars at this restaurant just for the excellent service. The food is excellent as well and has been so consistently through all these years. In too many restaurants, the quality diminishes over time, but this has never been the case at this CPK location.  I could list some of our favorite dishes here, but honestly, I might as well just insert a copy of the menu! We've had many different dishes, from salads to pizzas and pasta dishes, and they are all amazing. I can't wait to find out how Jorge did in the competition. I hope his ceviche pizza won, because that would mean it would become part of CPK's menu, and it would definitely become one of my absolute favorites! Thank you Elli, thank you Jorge, and thank you everybody at CPK Fairfax Corner!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax

Slow on refills and such. But it didn't go down the hill until we started getting our food.  4 out of 8 peoples orders were messed up. They took all this time to make caesar salad with chicken. And then when we got our checks, it was all mixed up. Ones food into others and such. Hot mess. My friend who ordered Caesar salad had to get it to go because they didn't bring it out until we finished paying for our checks.  Manager waived the check for people's messed up food and gave us free small plate for next time, but oh boy it does not do the justification of our trouble.

Kyra J.,"Washington, DC",55,122,237,4.0,9/17/2016,"I came here to celebrate my birthday dinner. Food is consistent nothing too fancy, but the atmosphere is very relaxing. I ordered a spiced chicken salad with champagne dressing on the side. This is of their better dressings. My friend ordered pasta with a side salad. Their side salads are huge, almost as big as a regular side. They serve complimentary bread which is nice, but the portion size is a little stingy and they didn't have any refills. So why the four stars? Because they served an amazing birthday ice cream with whip cream  drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with a cherry. It was actually one of the best birthday treats I have had at a restaurant. They served it in a nice square chilled glass container. Overall service is decent and I will be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax

It has been awhile since Ive gone to get pizza at CPK, and it was still a great time out. Our server came and got us water right away and gave us our time to look at the menu.  If you get a chance to get the buffalo cauliflower bites, GET THEM. Although deep fried into deliciousness, it really did taste like I was eating wings with bleu cheese. Even if it was actually just cauliflower. And no funky cauliflower smell either! The man got the original bbq chicken pizza, which is one of their classics. He thought it was great, I didnt think it was bad but I loved my pizza more haha. I got the Jamaican Jerk pizza, so forgive me for being biased; I love this pizza, it never disappoints me. It came with huge crispy chunks of bacon and has a sweet and spicy kick to it with the sauce and red onions to compliment. The chicken on it was a little dry, but I hardly noticed.

Our server was more than apologetic and the manager came over and said she would ""fix it.""  She certainly did!  Took the price of my pizza right off the bill, which is way more than I expected!  The Arty Spin Pizza was great, with plenty of roasted artichokes on a very thin but not crunchy dough.  I really enjoyed it.  Was in the mood for something different and it paid off.  My husband had the White Pizza with sauteed spinach (we were trying to catch up on our iron intake, apparently), and he said his was also very tasty. The crust was delicious. We shared the Butter Cake with vanilla ice cream, which was basically a moist pound cake.  It was good and sweet, a nice way to end dinner.  It's larger than it looks in the picture, by the way, so be prepared to be stuffed.

Once seated our server got to us right away and he was on point the whole night. Now on to the food. For starters we shared the humuus and I also got a small appetizer of chips with white corn and avocado. Both were yummy. There was also bread served on the table with a nice olive oil. My wife had the traditional pepperoni which she said was good and my little one the pasta with meat sauce which he definitely liked as it was all over his face. I was in the mood for some pasta too tonight and got their Jambalaya. I love cajun food so I knew I wanted it as soon as I saw it. Pretty solid, but I've definitely had better. Shrimp was cooked perfectly but the dish overall was a tad too salty.  Overall its more of a 3.5/5 (wish we could give half stars!) But I'll round up bc of the service.

Oh man- it was filled with squash and various vegetables. It was Creamy and filling but wasn't incredibly heavy or thick. Perfecto!  I don't believe this soup is a seasonal item but it screams Autumn! If you're looking for THE soup to have this fall then pick the Farmers Market Soup! It will keep you warm and full!  BTW: I went on a Sunday afternoon. Perfect Post-church hangout with friends or small groups or family!

The store is small and crowded. The bar area to the back of the restaurant was equally small but my husband and I managed to find a couple of seats.  I ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza expecting tons of flavor and spice. I found the salsa they served with it to be flavorless and not all that hot. I did not enjoy this pizza very much at all. The bartender was kind enough to bring me another type of salsa which helped with the flavor somewhat. My husband ordered a pepperoni. Flavors were ok, but it was really greasy.  On the upside, service was friendly and efficient. I am going to have to agree with Leslie L. This restaurant has definitely seen better days.

The cost is definitely worth what you get! Same with the pizzas. I like the Thai Peanut Pizza the best because it's a flatbread pizza. I also like the mushroom one as well. The Tortilla Sedona soup is also a favorite but I will warn you, it's very salty! Same with some of the pizzas. But the pasta dishes are really good and they are full of flavor. I don't think I've gotten anything I disliked. My favourite salad to get is the Thai Crunch salad. So yummy!! Service is always the same, quick and nice servers.

The wait: it was a Saturday in Fairfax corner so clearly I was expecting there to be a wait. We waited around for 20 min when they told us 10-15 so it wasn't so bad. When the hostess took our names she was kind of rude to my husband when she misunderstood his name and he corrected her but she was probably just stressed out about them being busy.  Seated: We got seated the waitress took our drink orders promptly.  Ordering: Our friend had ordered and in mid ordering she told us to hold on went to another table to take their order then came back to us, I was like uhh.... what? but I didn't care to much, I was just hungry! so It annoyed me at the time.  I got the 5 cheese and fresh tomato pizza. It took us awhile to get our food because like I said they were busy and just kept getting busier.  The food: Personally I loved mine it was delicious. So good I ate the entire thing :-O My husband got peperoni pizza (BORING) it was way to greasy for my liking but it was still good and he enjoyed it.  The waitress was very nice, only down fall was I didn't have water for a really long time and she kept passing by our table to go to the 3 tables beside us.

The corn, tortilla strips and jicama add a nice crunch and it is really good if you add avocados. I usually get that or the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza. I've had a bunch of other items off their menu, but these two are my favorites. The strawberry lemonade is really yummy too, but if you don't like super sweet drinks, I wouldn't get it.

However, portions are a bit small for the price.  Considering that a larger pizza at chains cost less than this, they're clearly inflating the price as a premium pizza, but I doubt the materials cost that much more..basically, I feel like I was paying more than it was worth.  This is a pretty bit hit to me, so I will not be frequenting cpk.

Prior to that I hadn't been since the final Harry Potter film came out, for good reason. After seeing the movie, my manfriend and I went for dinner and he found a long strand of hair in his sandwich. Yuck. We left and haven't returned.  So when my mom decided to treat me I figured it'd been long enough since Hairgate. I even had a free bday desert coupon in my email to use. Of course CPK has a rule that you can only view that e-mail 3 times before it slaps an ugly warning sign on it when you print. I printed it anyway and nicely asked the server if I could still use it. I have an iPhone, an iPad, and a computer. The email had been opened more than once while browsing. If I couldn't use it... No big deal, but its always nice to ask. He said he couldn't promise anything but would ask the manager. (Shocked to see the manager working there is still the one from Hairgate, this should have been my warning).  The server was okay, checked on us here or there, not really attentive. When we started packing up he asked what piece of cake I would like. I asked him if it was only for the red velvet (listed on the email) and he replied, ""Well I guess if we're allowing you to break the rules whats one more?"" Sigh. So I asked for my cake to go.

Their cocktail drinks are expensive, maybe since it's located in Fairfax Corner but my mojito was close to $9 I think. I always get either their Thai Chicken Pizza or their Chipotle Pizza.  Both have great flavors and I can never eat a whole pizza by myself. Their appetizers are lacking and a disappointment.  The Korean Tacos did not have the profile of Korean food at all, more Chinese since they used Hoisin Sauce instead and were very small portions.  I hate when American restaurants try to be trendy and try to add some asian dishes on their menu and automatically think that using certain ingredients will transform their dish into Asian just because you throw in some oranges slices or sesame seeds or some plum hoisin sauce...

D L.,"Fairfax, VA",10,31,,4.0,12/12/2012,"I have always been satisfied by this place. When I hang out in the Fairfax Corner, this is an easy choice among the crowd of restaurants for its price, portion, and overall quality of food. At peak times I often had to wait to be seated, but since the wait never exceeded 10 or 15 minutes, it has never been a concern. There is a huge variety of pizzas, ranging from meat-lover's favorites to vegetarian pizzas if you are watching your calorie count. Just make sure you order pizzas, not pastas or tacos as they are definitely not their specialty. As long as you order pizzas, you will be satisfied by the freshness of the ingredients, proper amount of serving, and rich, balanced flavor. My favorite pizza is California Club, which is full of softness of avocado and mayonnaise, and rich flavor of bacon and chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=60

I will admit, it doesn't matter how much I work out or how good I am with dieting (I'm not very good mind you)..I will forever eat bread that's served while waiting for a main course. The olive oil, seasoning mixed dipping sauce was amazing...seriously I wouldn't be able to recreate it ever..and the bread was warm and yummy. While we were noming away we realized the time and asked for our check to come with the meal. We each ordered a half caesar salad and it was decent, it's hard to mess up a salad but it has been done before and this one was good. The funniest thing about the experience is I was being blinded by the sun through an adjacent window and when our server noticed she asked if we wanted to be moved, I declined and scooted to the edge where I could see....no less than 7 minutes later..we see another server lowering a BLIND to block out the sun, we had a good laugh after realizing there was a solution right off the bat.

We ordered the Jamaican jerk pizza, one of my favorites because it's slightly sweet and also a little spicy. The crust was thin and crispy. The mango iced tea was good, not too sweet and syrupy like at some other places. We also ordered a bbq chicken salad and ended up having more than enough food to share and also take home.  The real highlight of our meal was our server Dale, he was very friendly and happy to help us even on a day when so many people were coming in for free pizza. I know what it's like to wait tables during promotions and many people don't tip correctly on discounted checks so the servers usually dread those shifts, however Dale kept a smile on his face the entire time and was just as happy to help us even after we told him we were there for the discount. I overheard him thanking other tables for their service and I was really impressed by his customer service, even on a shift when so many people were just there for free food.

I was also bothered by paying 15.00 for a 22oz bottle of beer that my waiter poured incorrectly into the glass.

Sadly, they don't make this one anymore. I came here a second time with my girls friends and ordered the Japanese eggplant. OH MY GOODNESS, it was so bland! When I say it is card-board tasting, I MEAN IT. There were barely any eggplants or broccoli on the pizza. Furthermore, each slice I had seemed dry. I was hungry that day, but I didn't even eat two of the slices of pizza. My friends ordered one with mushrooms, that tasted a tad better... I'm really dissapointed in CPK. The first time I went was WONDERFUL. The second time... ew.... The service here was bad, too. My group and I ordered 3 pizzas for 4 people. Is that really stingy? I mean, the pizzas aren't THAT small. The waiter obviously had a problem with it. She didn't even give us the free basket of bread at the beginning.

Dave C.,"Herndon, VA",56,167,30,4.0,7/20/2008,"Let's start with some basics: This is CPK. It's not a gourmet pizza joint, it's a chain that specializes in quirky toppings. It's a glorified Pizza Hut with the salad on your pizza rather than on an all-you-can-eat bar. So, with that said... This CPK provides generally fast service for large groups or couples. Our family qualifies as the former all by itself, and we've only had one slightly underwhelming experience with slow service. Otherwise the food's been swift, tasty, and not overly expensive. Their range of pizzas relies on some basic ingredients -- lots of grilled chicken, a few salad dressings, and whatnot -- but there are good options for the leaf-eaters among us as well as the carnivores. (Just don't anticipate eating a nice steak here. Or a nut cutlet.) Note that this place is next to a big movie theater, and gets HORRIBLY busy at times. Yesterday we had a wait of 30 minutes for a party of 6...which, considering the time of day and temperature outside, wasn't a bad wait at all. And we actually got seated faster than that.

I love the buffalo chicken pizza, bbq pizza, and the white pizza.  So yummy :) The reason I am giving this location only 3 stars is because of the service.  I have been here before and had great service but yesterday it was bad.  My fiance and I went and was seated very quickly.  The hostest was great but our server was terrible. 1.  I ordered my water with lemon and I didn't receive it with lemon.  Annoying, but stuff like that I let slide because I have waited tables before and know it can be HARD work. 2.  I wanted to try the greek pizza without olives but because its premixed I could get it to order.  This was not the servers fault my was disappointing. 3.  We were never given any silverware or napkins.  After our pizza were delivered I had to ask for silverware.  When our service returned he only gave us one set of silverware, eventhough there was 2 of us.  Which meant we had 1 napkin between the 2 of us.  So I then had to ask for napkins.  I know its just pizza and yes you can eat it with your hands, but really you should at least give someone a napkin when there paying $13 for a pizza. 4.  We also went around 6:00 on a Thursday which seemed to be the time where everyone brings their kids.  I love kids but prefer to eat with out the yelling, screaming, and beating of hands against the table.  Next time I will make a point to go later so I avoid to day care that CPK turns into. So bottomline there pizzas is great and are a great size.  I usually leave with some in a take out box.  Just don't count on wonderful service.   Also I have not had the Jambalaya personally but my fiance has tried it and said it was good, but wouldn't order it again.  Its wasn't very authentic, not that he was expecting it to be.  Just average at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=120

Little did we know, that this was a mistake.   We waited about 5-7 minutes and got our drinks and our appetizer, which was fine. So we start digging away at the appetizer (Tuscan hummus - not bad in my book. I've had better.) Anyways, the waiter comes by when we're done a few minutes later and takes away our plates. So we're waiting for our meal...and waiting...and waiting. 30 minutes go by and we haven't even seen our waiter, even to refill our drinks. Mind you we were there on Tuesday night around 8:30 pm, so the place was not jumping at all. So we finally see our waiter come by with our food and the order is completely messed up. My order and fiancee's order was fine; however, my brother had ordered a normal cheese pizza with chipolote sauce on it and instead he brought out two different pizzas. He takes both back, leaving my brother and mom with nothing to eat. And again, we wait. 10 minutes go by and we finally see the waiter, who says it'll be another ""few minutes."" At this point, my brother lost it and tracked down the manager. Told him how ridiculous the whole thing was that after an hour of sitting at their restaurant, we still didn't have the right food and the waiter was no where to be found during any of this.

Then I guess she finally ""realized"" that we were sitted then took our order. I was already pissed off at that point. No apologies about the wait, NOTHING!

I didnt want to make a big deal out of it so I just let it go then my fiance ended up sayin something and this dumbass of a waitress just shrugged it off...""ohh..i gave you the wrong drink?

Julie S.,"Northern, VA",1,73,,3.0,3/6/2013,"This is a combo review.  Been there twice for dinner in the time span of 1 week.  First visit would have been a 4 star.  2nd visit barely made it to a 3 star, so I am only giving it 3 total.   First of you have to get the salted caramel pudding.  TO DIE FOR!   Pros:  Jambalaya pasta was bountiful and pleasantly had mucho shrimp/crawfish/andoullle (sp?) sausage and ham. Very flavorful and delish. Fish Taco's were wonderful. Caesar salad wonderful...the freshly shaved parmigana cheese makes the salad. Kids meal of buttered fussilli got great reviews from the munchkin - but seriously can you screw that up?? Salted Caramel Pudding - awesome dessert! Cons: Crust on the BBQ chicken pizza was WAY overdone...super crispy/hard as a rock.  At 1st visit it was not well sauced and barely tasted like a bbq chicken pizza.  At 2nd visit the taste was MUCH more flavorful but unfortunately the crust was way overcooked. Service sucked at both visits.  They were slow the 1st time and VERY slow the 2nd time.  At 2nd visit they appeared to either be shortstaffed or just idiots handling the restaurant.  We stood at the hostess stand for several minutes while wait staff just looked at us from the back of the restaurant.  Very bizarre.  Munchin ordered a side of pineapple with the meal - it never came.  We told them to take it off the bill and they did and they apologized, but they still lose points.  Along with the fact that we had to ask twice for a chocolate milk refill cause it never came the first time.  They did refill ice tea multiple times, but it took forever to flag someone down to box up the leftovers, then to get the check, then to pay the check.  Service sucked. Another con: The booths are oddly very small.  Comfortable enough for 2 people but VERY tight for a standard family of 4.  Under the tables there is not enough room for 2 normal people to sit directly in front of each other without their feet stepping on each others.  It's weird.  Like the seats are too long for your butt and make your legs stick out too far under the table. Also weird was that on our 1st visit, we never received bread (and didn't ask because we didn't know if we were supposed to or not, but we both commented that it would have been nice to have gotten some bread to nibble on while we waited for our food.)  On our 2nd visit we were given bread and butter at the start of the meal.  So I assume that they neglected to provide it to us at the first visit and that we should have received it grrrrr....lose points for that! Next time we will probably just get our meals to go as there are still several dishes we want to try and we like that they have multiple 15 minute parking spaces right by the door to quickly run in and grab your take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=100

Their pizza is different and delicious.  I hate that I can eat an entire Greek pizza alone, but it's just so good. I am also a huge fan of their Hamburger Pizza nom nom NOM. If you prefer wheat, they can make any of the pizzas on honey wheat dough as well! If you're not in the mood for pizza, that's okay because their other menu items are pretty flippin' fantastic as well - from drinks, to soup and salads, it's good. The tortilla soup is perfect and I am pretty obsessed with their Miso Salad (minus the sea food, add the avocado!) The tequila lime fettuccine is fantastic. I'm so glad they created the ""Small Cravings"" menu - small portions if you just don't feel up to a whole meal. As for desserts, I'm a huge red velvet fan, theirs is okay but nothing to boast about.

Michelle P.,"Fairfax, VA",108,428,13,4.0,2/17/2009,"In college whenever we went to the King of Prussia Mall, my friend and i always plotted to have two meals there.   One for a late lunch and then dinner before we came home.  And i always wanted CPK for dinner because they had a philly cheesesteak pizza that was just awesome.    And so ever since then, even though they nolonger make it, i have held a special place for CPK in my heart.  This location is definitely not designed well in order to accomodate large groups (or even any groups bigger than 4), so the waiting area was crowded with people when we got there.  We only had to wait 5-10 minutes, which was good for a sunday night in Fairfax Towne Center.   Our waitress was really friendly, but it bugged me that she didn't write down our orders.   It makes me so nervous when they do that!  We got the spinach and artichoke dip to start with, which i liked because it came with regular and blue corn chips.  I like a variety!  Plus it was definitely not too artichokey, which is a plus in my book.   Then I decided not to get a pizza and instead got the chicken ceasar sandwich.  Pretty much because i really wanted the chicken tortilla soup and the sandwich came with it.  It was good, but had WAY too much bread.   Dont get me wrong, the bread was good, but i really wanted some meat!   Everyones pizza looked good.  I like how many options they have, and how you can get thin crust or the honey wheat crust.  Options are always good.

Amitabh A.,"Arlington, VA",9,53,8,5.0,2/7/2012,"We have been coming here for quite sometime now, and prefer this location to the Tysons Corner one. The service here has been consistent, and we always leave satisfied with the experience.  We always order the same thing:  1. Greek Pizza with the vegetarian option, which my wife loves 2. Asparagus and Spinach spaghetti 3. Lettuce Wraps 4. Pineapple Colada. Pineapple Colada is my wife's favorite. So when we went the last time, and it didn't taste the same as usual, we checked with the server if this was the version with alcohol. He confirmed it was not, and asked if we were not happy with it. We said it was ok, and he left. I didn't much of it, since he didn't say anything, but a few minutes later the manager came over and asked if there was an issue. We explained it wasn't a big deal but the Pineapple Colada tasted different than what we had before. The manager offered to get a new one without us asking for it. It was a really nice gesture on his part, and as a result we were happy with the experience. The service has always been competent at this location, except for one bad experience a few trips ago. For the most part, there is a reason why this place is crowded and has wait time of 15 minutes to an hour during peak hours.

I wasn't impressed with the sit down service - waiter was non existent and we ended up having sit next to a party of tweeners.

The pizza came to us nice and hot, the sauce was better than the other chain pizza places (I grew up in an Italian family, nothing compares to grandma's sauce), it was light and tasty. They loaded the pizza with toppings which is good because you're paying $15 for a personal pizza. I also tried a slice of my bf's BBQ chicken pizza and I liked that a lot, not too much sauce or onions. Overall their pizzas have a nice balance of flavor and toppings.  The service was fast and fairly friendly. We went on veterans day, I think they had a discount for veterans and active military. In order to get discounts for something like this you need some kind of valid ID proving you're telling the truth, some customers don't understand that and give the employees a hard time about it. I felt sorry for the employees that had to deal with that, I remember the days of dealing with that working at a movie theater, it's not fun. If you're ever a customer in that situation, be kind the employees are just following policy.

Ivy H.,"Chantilly, United States",0,7,11,1.0,23/8/2017,"A friend and I (fans of CPK) walked in on a Tuesday evening excited to grab dinner. The host hesitantly told us there would be a 10-15 min. wait. I was confused because from what I could see, there were 2 booths (4-seaters) and 1 two-person table in plain view that were clearly vacant. ""So, are those seats reserved?"" I asked pointing to the vacant seats. ""Oh, no but we're just going to need a few minutes to set up, etc..*trails off*... so it'll probably be maybe 5 min."" I don't understand. First it was 10-15 min. wait then it was 5 min. - did they simply not want to service us? Is this CPK location seriously so understaffed that they don't have the capacity to seat 2 customers for dinner? To me, this is poor customer service and if it's an issue of being understaffed, then it needs to be addressed by management.

Reminds me of papa johns for sure! They do charge extra for making it thin crust... $2? And to keep it somewhat healthy, we ordered quinoa & arugula salad. Love this salad!

John K.,"Fairfax, United States",304,379,1882,2.0,5/9/2016,"Saturday found us rushing to Fairfax Corner to make movie time for ""The Tunnel"", which by the way is about a man who gets trapped inside a tunnel after it collapses as he's driving through it. I really would've preferred neighboring Ozzie's, but it was rather busy and we were in a mad rush. No matter, let's get on with this review of the vapid and uninspiring eats at California Pizza Kitchen.  I've been to California Pizza Kitchen all of four times in my entire life and this being the fourth. Two times were at airports when I was either delayed or on a layover and once with a friend for drinks. Perhaps, I can focus on something positive. The host and hostess were very polite and might I dare even nod towards charming? And, this is where it pretty much ends for me. Service *** / ***** Accommodations | Atmosphere **** / ***** Value ** / ***** Spaghetti Bolognese ** / ***** BBQ Chicken Pizza ** / ***** Salmon | Corn Medley *** / ***** Our server was rather humdrum and she spent more time on her phone versus paying attention to her patrons. Unresolved on eating pizza, I impulsively decided on spaghetti. I want to avoid sounding harsh, but the spaghetti was likely on the same level as that served to me and the other 8th grade kids in the cafeteria when I clearly had an immature and less discerning palate. The pizza was dry and boring. No personality other than the pineapples that my good wife asked for. Possibly and just a possibility in that there might have been some redeeming qualities about my daughter's salmon entree. Salmon was tender and cooked through without tasting rubbery, but the corn medley was off the charts in terms of salt. Can't figure out America's infatuation with salt. Price point is contentious here. Food quality doesn't quite chart high enough to justify the prices. You won't burn a hole in your wallet, but there is a disparity in money spent and appeal. Lesson learned. Leave early enough before the movie to dine at an establishment that will deliver in terms of overall value and appeal. Well, it is within a stone's throw of the theatre, but this point alone is not compelling enough to return.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax
Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, United States",211,594,214,2.0,27/7/2016,"I went to the California Pizza Kitchen for dinner with my husband on 7/21/16.  Before I go into why I not giving the restaurant a higher rating I will say what I liked about the restaurant. I liked the ambiance and, as far as a family friendly restaurant it is a great choice. The service was good. I also think parking and getting to the restaurant is super convenient.  I am not rating the restaurant higher is frankly the cost of the food and the portions you receive. The menu is divided into small bites and appetizers (and when they say ""small bites"" they mean it).  The food options for a pescetarian such as myself are also somewhat limited which was surprised because pizza places are usually very vegetarian friendly. On that note, I ordered a mushroom pizza (one of 2 vegetarian pizzas available) with truffle oil (which by the way has upcharge for a table side portion). It was satisfactory but I didn't feel like it was work coming back for.  It is called California Pizza Kitchen but appears the menu is pushing more pasta and their expensive entrees than actually pizza.  I was also slightly annoyed that I signed up for rewards at an event where they were promoting their food (and started to receive spam) and yet the restaurant had the incorrect information (i.e. showing I had previously been to restaurant and was not entitled to a free appetizer).  In a nutshell, with all the fantastic dining options in the shopping plaza I would only go back to the California Pizza Kitchen if I was in a real pinch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax
Marion D.,"Centreville, United States",0,1,,5.0,9/12/2017,"Before I start my review, I have to apologize to Elli & Jorge that it's taken me so long to write it.  My husband and I have been going to this CPK regularly pretty much since they opened. In all those years, we have always received the most wonderful, friendly, and attentive service. Several servers come by our table just to say hello, even if we're sitting at another server's table. One such server was Elli. She always gave the most amazing and friendly service and came to chat for a few minutes even when she wasn't waitressing our table. Well, Elli is the manager now, and we couldn't be happier for her! She still comes by our table every time she sees us. She has told us that she loves what she does, and it shows!  At our last visit to CPK, Elli told us that one of the chef's, Jorge, had come up with a ceviche pizza for a company-wide competition. She asked if we would like to try it (of course we did!!), so she asked Jorge to bake one of his special pizzas just for us. It was beyond amazing!!! I feel kind of guilty, but my husband and I polished off the entire pizza; we just couldn't stop eating! It certainly proved that Jorge is an excellent chef in his own right who is capable of so much more than just following CPK's recipes. Elli asked Jorge to come to our table so we could thank him personally, and he was so nice; he seemed genuinely happy to hear how much we liked his pizza. Which brings me to the food-part of my review, although I'm sure you could guess by now that we're not regulars at this restaurant just for the excellent service. The food is excellent as well and has been so consistently through all these years. In too many restaurants, the quality diminishes over time, but this has never been the case at this CPK location.  I could list some of our favorite dishes here, but honestly, I might as well just insert a copy of the menu! We've had many different dishes, from salads to pizzas and pasta dishes, and they are all amazing. I can't wait to find out how Jorge did in the competition. I hope his ceviche pizza won, because that would mean it would become part of CPK's menu, and it would definitely become one of my absolute favorites!

And then when we got our checks, it was all mixed up. Ones food into others and such. Hot mess. My friend who ordered Caesar salad had to get it to go because they didn't bring it out until we finished paying for our checks.

Their side salads are huge, almost as big as a regular side. They serve complimentary bread which is nice, but the portion size is a little stingy and they didn't have any refills. So why the four stars? Because they served an amazing birthday ice cream with whip cream  drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with a cherry.

He thought it was great, I didnt think it was bad but I loved my pizza more haha. I got the Jamaican Jerk pizza, so forgive me for being biased; I love this pizza, it never disappoints me.

I couldn't pick up a slice of pizza without the whole thing falling apart! I ended up eating with a fork and knife. Service was attentive and our glasses were always filled with water but that didn't matter as much to me when the food was so disappointing. Who wants to pay $13-14 excluding tip for a soggy pizza?

Dates and butternut squash really made the salad and ""spiced"" doesn't mean spicy, which is good. We ended with the butter cake (no judgement, please!!)

Unfortunately, the chicken was dry and the pasta was over cooked.  The kids meal is what prevented that 5th star.   I will definitely make plans to come back soon and explore this menu, and let's not forget to mention this is a budget friendly restaurant too.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=20

I guess we were in such a rush to catch our movie last night that we missed it. Nice try, CPK. Nice try. Definitely lost a few customers now... **************** Needs improvement. Manager said they were short staffed tonight and I can understand that, but what I can't understand is why the tables next to and behind us (both arrived later and therefore placed their orders later) managed to get their food before our table. Possibly because our server forgot my order and didn't actually put it in til much later. Lame. This is why it's helpful to write orders down instead of trying to memorize, especially when you're short staffed.  Then we noticed that my friend's pasta had been sitting out for quite some time. I guess they didn't bring it to our table because they were waiting for our other orders to be ready. The problem with that is by the time it finally got to our table, the pasta was dry and cold. My friend complained and the server tried his best not to show attitude, but eventually he couldnt hide it anymore, gave up and called his manager. She apologized for the wait, comped the cold pasta and refilled our waters (something the server failed to do).  I want to think that maybe we just had a crappy server tonight, but then again...the roasted artichoke and spinach pizza was dry, the garlic cream fettuccine was also dry (and cold), and the spicy buffalo cauliflower's portion size felt more like a $3 plate than the listed $6.99.

We went to the same restaurant all the time in Colorado and we had good food and serves. Oh, and I was charged for the replacement dish. Do not go there, the manager was pointless. Oh and the hostess mumbled for us to follow her to the table, another hostess had to tells us to follow the first one.

They recently renovated the restaurant and now it has like a farmers feel to it. Nice, big chairs and it feels a bit more spacious. The service is always prompt and attentive when I come. I've never had a problem here before, even gave a guy a 50% tip before because he was just that good. The food has gotten better also! My favorite appetizer is the spinach dip with the warm tortilla chips. Also, the fried mac and cheese bites are good, it's lightly fried with a creamy cheese sauce. The Thai chicken pizza is the best pizza they have and a must try, the secret is to ask for extra peanut sauce so you can pour some more on the pizza. The jamaican jerk pizza is my second favorite with a honey glazed sauce with chicken and ham. It doesn't taste anything ""jamaican"" but its still good. Kung pao noodles with shrimp is spicy but has a great Kung pao sauce and the shrimp is cooked perfectly each time. Their drinks are actually pretty good too, alcoholic and mixed lemonades/teas.

The food was decent and the staff/management at the time treated me very well. I don't know what I was expecting at this location, but it was somewhat of a letdown - just very average. The store is small and crowded. The bar area to the back of the restaurant was equally small but my husband and I managed to find a couple of seats.  I ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza expecting tons of flavor and spice. I found the salsa they served with it to be flavorless and not all that hot. I did not enjoy this pizza very much at all. The bartender was kind enough to bring me another type of salsa which helped with the flavor somewhat. My husband ordered a pepperoni. Flavors were ok, but it was really greasy.  On the upside, service was friendly and efficient. I am going to have to agree with Leslie L. This restaurant has definitely seen better days. I doubt we will go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=40

The dinning area is small and narrow with the female restroom a few steps from the booth we were seated in. The habanero pizza was ""okay"" I thought it would be better. The jerk chicken pizza was too sweet (half/half pizza). My gfs daughter ordered the white pizza and thought it was tasty but what teenager doesn't like pizza.

Lynn F.,"Fairfax, United States",388,253,1769,4.0,12/4/2016,"I've been here so many times and I just really like it. The only reason why it loses a star is because the food is just SO UNHEALTHY. Even the food they spew as ""healthy"" still has more calories than fast food places. But anyway, I have been here and ordered, almost all the pasta dishes and I love the portions they give! The cost is definitely worth what you get! Same with the pizzas. I like the Thai Peanut Pizza the best because it's a flatbread pizza. I also like the mushroom one as well. The Tortilla Sedona soup is also a favorite but I will warn you, it's very salty! Same with some of the pizzas. But the pasta dishes are really good and they are full of flavor. I don't think I've gotten anything I disliked. My favourite salad to get is the Thai Crunch salad. So yummy!! Service is always the same, quick and nice servers. They all seem attentive and they know the menu well so if you have questions, they are knowledgable. All in all, it's a nice sit down and talk place.

They came with two dipping sauces, one more zesty and one was ranch. I ordered a caesar salad. I was not impressed by this salad. Most of the lettuce was not very good (obviously not fresh) and the dressing was lacking. The highlight (which is pretty much always the highlight) was the barbecue chicken pizza.

The wait: it was a Saturday in Fairfax corner so clearly I was expecting there to be a wait. We waited around for 20 min when they told us 10-15 so it wasn't so bad. When the hostess took our names she was kind of rude to my husband when she misunderstood his name and he corrected her but she was probably just stressed out about them being busy.  Seated: We got seated the waitress took our drink orders promptly.  Ordering: Our friend had ordered and in mid ordering she told us to hold on went to another table to take their order then came back to us, I was like uhh.... what? but I didn't care to much, I was just hungry! so It annoyed me at the time.  I got the 5 cheese and fresh tomato pizza. It took us awhile to get our food because like I said they were busy and just kept getting busier.  The food: Personally I loved mine it was delicious. So good I ate the entire thing :-O My husband got peperoni pizza (BORING) it was way to greasy for my liking but it was still good and he enjoyed it.  The waitress was very nice, only down fall was I didn't have water for a really long time and she kept passing by our table to go to the 3 tables beside us. She apologized once she realized she had forgotten and got it for me right away.

It's a good place to stop at before going to see a movie, except the crowds are crazy on the weekends.

That being said, the food is pretty good. My favorite thing off their menu is the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped salad. It's tossed in a house made ranch dressing and BBQ sauce. The corn, tortilla strips and jicama add a nice crunch and it is really good if you add avocados. I usually get that or the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza. I've had a bunch of other items off their menu, but these two are my favorites. The strawberry lemonade is really yummy too, but if you don't like super sweet drinks, I wouldn't get it.

C R.,"Washington, DC, United States",18,247,32,4.0,22/4/2014,"I went for dinner on an early Saturday evening amd was immediately seated.  I ordered a soda, which has unlimited refills.  We ordered 3 pizzas..thai chicken, california club and artichoke/spinach.  All were very tasty.  The cali club was interesting with bacon, raw lettuce-slawish and avocado.  Thai chicken pizza was interesting, not a bit fan of the raw beansprouts and cilantro.  I would love to come back, except 2 small things adding up to 1 lost star. However, portions are a bit small for the price.  Considering that a larger pizza at chains cost less than this, they're clearly inflating the price as a premium pizza, but I doubt the materials cost that much more..basically, I feel like I was paying more than it was worth.  This is a pretty bit hit to me, so I will not be frequenting cpk. Also, service was a bit weak.  Granted it was Saturday, but we just want to get on with our lives.  We were ready to pay the bill and willing to give our seats to new customers, but apparently, that was not a priority.  Oh well.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=60

Sarah J.,"Fairfax, United States",67,48,6,1.0,22/1/2013,"Oof. This is a long time coming. I gave CPK another chance on my birthday a few weeks ago. Prior to that I hadn't been since the final Harry Potter film came out, for good reason. After seeing the movie, my manfriend and I went for dinner and he found a long strand of hair in his sandwich. Yuck. We left and haven't returned.  So when my mom decided to treat me I figured it'd been long enough since Hairgate. I even had a free bday desert coupon in my email to use. Of course CPK has a rule that you can only view that e-mail 3 times before it slaps an ugly warning sign on it when you print. I printed it anyway and nicely asked the server if I could still use it. I have an iPhone, an iPad, and a computer. The email had been opened more than once while browsing. If I couldn't use it... No big deal, but its always nice to ask. He said he couldn't promise anything but would ask the manager. (Shocked to see the manager working there is still the one from Hairgate, this should have been my warning).  The server was okay, checked on us here or there, not really attentive. When we started packing up he asked what piece of cake I would like. I asked him if it was only for the red velvet (listed on the email) and he replied, ""Well I guess if we're allowing you to break the rules whats one more?"" Sigh. So I asked for my cake to go.  And guess what?  I got home to put the ice cream and vanilla cream in the refrigerator only to find a damn black hair in the cream.

Their cocktail drinks are expensive, maybe since it's located in Fairfax Corner but my mojito was close to $9 I think. I always get either their Thai Chicken Pizza or their Chipotle Pizza.  Both have great flavors and I can never eat a whole pizza by myself. Their appetizers are lacking and a disappointment.  The Korean Tacos did not have the profile of Korean food at all, more Chinese since they used Hoisin Sauce instead and were very small portions.  I hate when American restaurants try to be trendy and try to add some asian dishes on their menu and automatically think that using certain ingredients will transform their dish into Asian just because you throw in some oranges slices or sesame seeds or some plum hoisin sauce...

At peak times I often had to wait to be seated, but since the wait never exceeded 10 or 15 minutes, it has never been a concern. There is a huge variety of pizzas, ranging from meat-lover's favorites to vegetarian pizzas if you are watching your calorie count. Just make sure you order pizzas, not pastas or tacos as they are definitely not their specialty. As long as you order pizzas, you will be satisfied by the freshness of the ingredients, proper amount of serving, and rich, balanced flavor.

We ordered the Jamaican jerk pizza, one of my favorites because it's slightly sweet and also a little spicy. The crust was thin and crispy. The mango iced tea was good, not too sweet and syrupy like at some other places. We also ordered a bbq chicken salad and ended up having more than enough food to share and also take home.  The real highlight of our meal was our server Dale, he was very friendly and happy to help us even on a day when so many people were coming in for free pizza. I know what it's like to wait tables during promotions and many people don't tip correctly on discounted checks so the servers usually dread those shifts, however Dale kept a smile on his face the entire time and was just as happy to help us even after we told him we were there for the discount.

Sadly, they don't make this one anymore. I came here a second time with my girls friends and ordered the Japanese eggplant. OH MY GOODNESS, it was so bland! When I say it is card-board tasting, I MEAN IT. There were barely any eggplants or broccoli on the pizza. Furthermore, each slice I had seemed dry. I was hungry that day, but I didn't even eat two of the slices of pizza. My friends ordered one with mushrooms, that tasted a tad better... I'm really dissapointed in CPK. The first time I went was WONDERFUL. The second time... ew.... The service here was bad, too. My group and I ordered 3 pizzas for 4 people. Is that really stingy? I mean, the pizzas aren't THAT small. The waiter obviously had a problem with it. She didn't even give us the free basket of bread at the beginning. On the other hand, the other table with two Caucasian boys got as many refill on bread as they wanted. Rude, I'd say. I cannot say I would NEVER come back here again.

I decided to go with cup of soup and 7"" Pizza. the soup was butternut squash soup; it was sooooo delicious. I will definitely order it again and again and again. and I chose Thai Chicken Pizza; it was good but was not my favorite. 5- my sister also decided to go with the lunch menu; and she ordered green salad with 7"" CALIFORNIA VEGGIE. the pizza was very good and will try it again. So over all, the food experience was good for our first time. however, the service was not that good. our servant never checked on us after our order came out. we wanted a drink refill but it was hard to find someone to get our request.  I think they can be better with their customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=80

Julie S.,"Northern, United States",1,73,,3.0,6/3/2013,"This is a combo review.  Been there twice for dinner in the time span of 1 week.  First visit would have been a 4 star.  2nd visit barely made it to a 3 star, so I am only giving it 3 total.   First of you have to get the salted caramel pudding.  TO DIE FOR!   Pros:  Jambalaya pasta was bountiful and pleasantly had mucho shrimp/crawfish/andoullle (sp?) sausage and ham. Very flavorful and delish. Fish Taco's were wonderful. Caesar salad wonderful...the freshly shaved parmigana cheese makes the salad. Kids meal of buttered fussilli got great reviews from the munchkin - but seriously can you screw that up?? Salted Caramel Pudding - awesome dessert! Cons: Crust on the BBQ chicken pizza was WAY overdone...super crispy/hard as a rock.  At 1st visit it was not well sauced and barely tasted like a bbq chicken pizza.  At 2nd visit the taste was MUCH more flavorful but unfortunately the crust was way overcooked. Service sucked at both visits.  They were slow the 1st time and VERY slow the 2nd time.  At 2nd visit they appeared to either be shortstaffed or just idiots handling the restaurant.  We stood at the hostess stand for several minutes while wait staff just looked at us from the back of the restaurant.  Very bizarre.  Munchin ordered a side of pineapple with the meal - it never came.  We told them to take it off the bill and they did and they apologized, but they still lose points.  Along with the fact that we had to ask twice for a chocolate milk refill cause it never came the first time.  They did refill ice tea multiple times, but it took forever to flag someone down to box up the leftovers, then to get the check, then to pay the check.  Service sucked. Another con: The booths are oddly very small.  Comfortable enough for 2 people but VERY tight for a standard family of 4.  Under the tables there is not enough room for 2 normal people to sit directly in front of each other without their feet stepping on each others.  It's weird.  Like the seats are too long for your butt and make your legs stick out too far under the table. Also weird was that on our 1st visit, we never received bread (and didn't ask because we didn't know if we were supposed to or not, but we both commented that it would have been nice to have gotten some bread to nibble on while we waited for our food.)  On our 2nd visit we were given bread and butter at the start of the meal.  So I assume that they neglected to provide it to us at the first visit and that we should have received it grrrrr....lose points for that! Next time we will probably just get our meals to go as there are still several dishes we want to try and we like that they have multiple 15 minute parking spaces right by the door to quickly run in and grab your take out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=100

If you prefer wheat, they can make any of the pizzas on honey wheat dough as well! If you're not in the mood for pizza, that's okay because their other menu items are pretty flippin' fantastic as well - from drinks, to soup and salads, it's good. The tortilla soup is perfect and I am pretty obsessed with their Miso Salad (minus the sea food, add the avocado!) The tequila lime fettuccine is fantastic.

This location is definitely not designed well in order to accomodate large groups (or even any groups bigger than 4), so the waiting area was crowded with people when we got there.  We only had to wait 5-10 minutes, which was good for a sunday night in Fairfax Towne Center.   Our waitress was really friendly, but it bugged me that she didn't write down our orders.   It makes me so nervous when they do that!  We got the spinach and artichoke dip to start with, which i liked because it came with regular and blue corn chips.  I like a variety!  Plus it was definitely not too artichokey, which is a plus in my book.   Then I decided not to get a pizza and instead got the chicken ceasar sandwich.  Pretty much because i really wanted the chicken tortilla soup and the sandwich came with it.  It was good, but had WAY too much bread.   Dont get me wrong, the bread was good, but i really wanted some meat!   Everyones pizza looked good.  I like how many options they have, and how you can get thin crust or the honey wheat crust.  Options are always good.

Asparagus and Spinach spaghetti 3. Lettuce Wraps 4. Pineapple Colada. Pineapple Colada is my wife's favorite. So when we went the last time, and it didn't taste the same as usual, we checked with the server if this was the version with alcohol. He confirmed it was not, and asked if we were not happy with it. We said it was ok, and he left. I didn't much of it, since he didn't say anything, but a few minutes later the manager came over and asked if there was an issue. We explained it wasn't a big deal but the Pineapple Colada tasted different than what we had before. The manager offered to get a new one without us asking for it. It was a really nice gesture on his part, and as a result we were happy with the experience. The service has always been competent at this location, except for one bad experience a few trips ago. For the most part, there is a reason why this place is crowded and has wait time of 15 minutes to an hour during peak hours.

Dave C.,"Herndon, United States",56,167,30,4.0,20/7/2008,"Let's start with some basics: This is CPK. It's not a gourmet pizza joint, it's a chain that specializes in quirky toppings. It's a glorified Pizza Hut with the salad on your pizza rather than on an all-you-can-eat bar. So, with that said... This CPK provides generally fast service for large groups or couples. Our family qualifies as the former all by itself, and we've only had one slightly underwhelming experience with slow service. Otherwise the food's been swift, tasty, and not overly expensive. Their range of pizzas relies on some basic ingredients -- lots of grilled chicken, a few salad dressings, and whatnot -- but there are good options for the leaf-eaters among us as well as the carnivores. (Just don't anticipate eating a nice steak here. Or a nut cutlet.) Note that this place is next to a big movie theater, and gets HORRIBLY busy at times. Yesterday we had a wait of 30 minutes for a party of 6...which, considering the time of day and temperature outside, wasn't a bad wait at all. And we actually got seated faster than that.

I love the buffalo chicken pizza, bbq pizza, and the white pizza.  So yummy :) The reason I am giving this location only 3 stars is because of the service.  I have been here before and had great service but yesterday it was bad.  My fiance and I went and was seated very quickly.  The hostest was great but our server was terrible. 1.  I ordered my water with lemon and I didn't receive it with lemon.  Annoying, but stuff like that I let slide because I have waited tables before and know it can be HARD work. 2.  I wanted to try the greek pizza without olives but because its premixed I could get it to order.  This was not the servers fault my was disappointing. 3.  We were never given any silverware or napkins.  After our pizza were delivered I had to ask for silverware.  When our service returned he only gave us one set of silverware, eventhough there was 2 of us.  Which meant we had 1 napkin between the 2 of us.  So I then had to ask for napkins.  I know its just pizza and yes you can eat it with your hands, but really you should at least give someone a napkin when there paying $13 for a pizza. 4.  We also went around 6:00 on a Thursday which seemed to be the time where everyone brings their kids.  I love kids but prefer to eat with out the yelling, screaming, and beating of hands against the table.  Next time I will make a point to go later so I avoid to day care that CPK turns into. So bottomline there pizzas is great and are a great size.  I usually leave with some in a take out box.  Just don't count on wonderful service.   Also I have not had the Jambalaya personally but my fiance has tried it and said it was good, but wouldn't order it again.  Its wasn't very authentic, not that he was expecting it to be.  Just average at best.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=120

So we start digging away at the appetizer (Tuscan hummus - not bad in my book. I've had better.) Anyways, the waiter comes by when we're done a few minutes later and takes away our plates. So we're waiting for our meal...and waiting...and waiting. 30 minutes go by and we haven't even seen our waiter, even to refill our drinks. Mind you we were there on Tuesday night around 8:30 pm, so the place was not jumping at all. So we finally see our waiter come by with our food and the order is completely messed up. My order and fiancee's order was fine; however, my brother had ordered a normal cheese pizza with chipolote sauce on it and instead he brought out two different pizzas. He takes both back, leaving my brother and mom with nothing to eat. And again, we wait. 10 minutes go by and we finally see the waiter, who says it'll be another ""few minutes."" At this point, my brother lost it and tracked down the manager. Told him how ridiculous the whole thing was that after an hour of sitting at their restaurant, we still didn't have the right food and the waiter was no where to be found during any of this. The manager apologized and actually comped the whole meal. Although the manager was nice and we eventually got the food we ordered, so I just don't think we'll be going back to this restaurant. If they can't get our orders right when it's not busy, then I don't want to go there when they actually are.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=120
Jam M.,"Centreville, United States",24,12,2,2.0,20/8/2011,"We used to come here a lot since its right infront of a movie theater BUT...our last visit was NOT a good one. Im a firm believer that the whole experience comes from the SERVICE you get from a restaurant. My fiance and I are BOTH working adults yet we were treated like we were kids. We got sat down and waited 10 minutes (yes coz we actually timed it) a group of older people sat down 5 minutes after we did and the waitress that we were suppose to have took their order before us. She looked at me and kept on going. Mind you, we were sitted 10 minutes before they were yet didnt get NO HELP. IT WAS NOT EVEN BUSY!!!! Then I guess she finally ""realized"" that we were sitted then took our order. I was already pissed off at that point. No apologies about the wait, NOTHING! Then...we finally got our drinks and gave me the wrong drink. I didnt want to make a big deal out of it so I just let it go then my fiance ended up sayin something and this dumbass of a waitress just shrugged it off...""ohh..i gave you the wrong drink? ((shrugs))""..REALLY? REALLY? I used to be a waitress in college and there was no way I would act such a way to my customers. I literrally wanted to get up and smack the shit out of her o spill my drink ""by accident"" and have her ass clean that shit up.  so I just let my fiance talk to the manager. The manager was of course nice. What was he suppose to do? Of couse he offered us a free meal, of course he tried to get us to come back... my respond ""sorry but i would def not come back to this location"" he said ""was it that bad"" I replied ""hell effin yes..are you serious..waited for 10 minutes to get our drinks, treated like we werent even there, not apologetic for the wait, gave me the wrong drink then shrugging it off, who the hell does she think she   YES IT WAS THAT EFFIN BAD and im yelping this experience!!!!"" LOL.. I was mad beyond belief that I kind of felt bad for the manager. the he goes...""oh keri, shes always on point with her service..."" then I said ""well..keris boyfriend probably just broke up with her or something..coz shes wayyyyyy off today"" SMH SMH SMH... I will not come back to this place...the food is good if youre asking but the service that I received...was beyond horrible! Im offended!!! a paying customer for some really fancy ass pizza...their pizza is just too fancy for me..shouldve just ordered pizza from the HUT and called it a day!!!! SMDH... food good..service.. BLEH! go when u have a group of rude friends so they wouldnt even care for bad service but dont go with ur significant other and def DONT GO if youre hungry!!!! or..to add to my frustration...a family of 3 had to wait 45 minutes for their food also (how i know that? Coz i heard em say it to eachother..they were right behind me) but they didnt complain but was giving us the eye of approval when we did. UGHHHH Never again!!!!THAT IS ALL!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-fairfax?start=120
