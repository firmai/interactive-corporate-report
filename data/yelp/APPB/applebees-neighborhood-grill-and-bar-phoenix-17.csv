Jean S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",26,124,34,4.0,9/22/2017,"My original review was for a location in Texas.  This one is for the Phoenix one at 24th and Baseline.  It was excellent.  We chose it for the new lunch pairings.  I had tomato basil soup and 1/2 club sandwich.  It was hot, crispy and well flavored.  It is not often you can get away with a decent lunch under 15 bucks!  The server was also top notch!  I think her name was Breanna.  Thanks Breanna!  Your location is top notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17
Sara G.,"Chandler, AZ",158,7,,1.0,1/3/2018,"A family in here was visibly harrassing a server and management did nothing to protect the employee. The family was causing a scene and even told the server to meet them outside to fight, while everyone near them had to hear the altercation.  The family should have been asked to leave, but instead it looks like they got their meal comped or taken care of... which is probably what they wanted. The manager should GROW SOME and back his employees, especially when they are being threatened. The food took forever, had to ask for everything twice, came out hard and not enjoyable. 0/10 do NOT recommend.... unless you're looking for Jerry Springer type fighting at a family restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17

Chef J.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,11,1,1.0,3/2/2017,"Should be a -5 (minus) star. A complete waste of money. Never, ever, have I seen such a disgraceful presentation of a 1/2 rack of ribs in my frikin entire life. You should be ashamed of putting that on a plate to serve to a customer. I feed my Toy Chihuahua bigger portions. Looking at the size of the ribs were compared to what my dogs ribs looked like. Funny my dogs ribs had more meat.  Mr District Manager, you need to check whats going out on the plates. If you sitdown and order this meal, you would be just as disappointed as my wife and I were. Both of us being in the restaurant business for a total of 80 years combined, cooking and managerial,  we know if you wouldn't eat it, don't serve it. Your people need to take ownership and speak up when they see something wrong. I just cant believe this was allowed to be served. It looks like it was boiled all night and then re-heated in microwave. It was as tough as jerky. Shame, shame, shame on you. The funny thing about this ordeal is that I made the mistake. I was supposed to go to Chili's for the ribs which looked good on tv, and I mixed up the names and went to you guys.

Brian J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,98,158,5.0,7/17/2016,"We had a wonderful experience with this place! We've eaten at Applebees in the past and have never been let down; however, up until now, we had always dined at the restaurant. This time, we decided to try something new so we placed our order online. As you can imagine, ordering online turned out to be a very simple process. We got to pick specifically what we wanted with each meal and appetizer. For example, I ordered a burger so I got to specify how I wanted it cooked, what toppings (including sauces and type of cheese), and I even got to specify that I wanted my fries seasoned with garlic. We then set the time for when we wanted the food to be ready. At the specified time, we drove to the restaurant and parked in the space designated for car-side pick-up. Within minutes, a very polite gentleman approached us and asked to confirm our order. Soon afterwards, he brought us our food, which smelled absolutely wonderful on the ride home. The food was terrific. My burger was just fantastic. It was made exactly as I had ordered. My wife had the chicken tenders (which I sampled) and those were awesome too. We also got the boneless barbecue wings, which also rocked.  I can't wait to have Applebees again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17

Maybe the reasonable prices, the happy hour... but I always leave feeling under satisfied. The food is mediocre. I can think of so many other local places that serve quality American food but for some reason, we find ourselves at Applebees at least twice, maybe 4-5 times a year. It's a safe choice for late light munchies. And this location has friendly, attentive staff. You'll always be seated right away. And one of their charming bartenders does magic! Try to find him.

We ordered the unlimited soup, salad, and bread for $9.99. The salad was ok. I guess that is hard to mess up. The soup was not soup. It was the consistency of tomato paste. It glooped off of my spoon. When I asked for another, the waitress said ""well it's the same soup, so..."" And then just kinda shrugged like I was the problem. Then I asked for our bread which we didn't receive. She said ""we don't do that anymore. If you want bread it's a dollar extra."" I explained that it was on the menu.

I asked my son if he wanted to go visit our old Applebee's.  We use to live in South Phoenix for 8 years, and Applebee's on 24th st & Baseline became like a family/friend hang out for us. So off we went, it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait, which we thought was pretty cool.  When we got to our booth, we talked about the times we had been there , and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery, it was fun talking about the old memories. We went with the 2 for 20 deal, and the food tasted great, our service was friendly and fast, it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my, I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on,  he said mom, just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feet...I said WHAT!! He said yes, it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go, let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right then....but I didn't, I left the tip, because she was good, and we left. Yes I did tell Patrick the Kitchen Manger that my son had saw a mouse, he told me that they come from across the street and that he will notify his pest control guy. BUT OMG!!!

Rick G.,"Phoenix, AZ",999,396,11390,1.0,4/13/2015,"My wife and I have frequented many a fabulous Applebee's across the country and have always been fascinated by their ability to offer very good food, great atmosphere and some of the best service of any chain eatery around.  Something really wrong seems to have happened at this location. Food was just okay, and the service atrocious.  With multiple tables clear and available we were told there was a twenty minute wait.  When asking about the tables that were clean and clear, we were told they were reserved - at Applebee's? Another family ahead of us, made the decision to go next door to IHOP!  We eventually did something we've never done before, we confiscated one of the various empty tables.  By the time dinner came around, we found the servings were adequate, but the taste and apparent quality of our fare was less than noteworthy!  At this visit we tried the Club Grill Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries which was nothing to write home about, and the Fish & Chips with French Fries.  As a traditional Fish & Chips lover, and often ordered at Applebee's, I found the fish and its batter was considerably bland, unlike many others I've enjoyed over the years in many another Applebee's.  Although the server was nice and very apologetic for the inconvenience, and the on duty manager also apologized, we found the incident very discomforting and aggravating to experience from what usually has been a favorite. Hopefully this a one-off incident, but it may take a long time before I frequent this Applebee's again.

Therefore it is obvious that service and food may take a little longer than usual.   I don't mind having a busy server as long as they have a good attitude.  Out server was great. He was not the problem. Our wings came out extremely dry and crunchy, it is obvious that it was thrown into the frier a couple times. The wings were so dry and and crunchy they were clearly old wings.  The fries came out a while after the wings and we're dark brown. Clearly those were refried a couple times and they tasted awful.   This has been about the third time I've come and each time the wings come out tasting very old. I will not be coming back and would not recommend this location.  Food is awful.  Except for the Wong tong chicken tacos. Those are the bomb. Also, I had a Pina colada and the drink was extremely watered down.  The drink tasted more watery than it should've been.  Could have been due to the fact that the server was busy and it may have been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes.  It came out shortly before dinner was out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=20

The best thing on the menu to me is the 2 for 20 or 2 for 25 you won't be displeased with anything on that section. Now my wife likes the pub grill diet salmon but I've never had it. I get ribs or the sirloin and for a chain the steak is pretty good. The management is quite friendly ironically they speak and are very cordial but quite a bit of the wait staff is impatient, rude, and could condescending.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=40
Lisa B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,,1.0,3/27/2015,"Poor service! The food however, is great! I suggest calling your order in and picking it up.

Cupcake M.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,57,25,3.0,8/10/2011,"No more breadstick for you ...    My co-worker and I went  to Applebee's for lunch, it was after 1, so we figured the rush would be gone. We each ordered the USS (unlimited soup and salad). While we were eatting our server asked if we wanted to have another go around of soup and salad, while I love love soup, I am not big on salad, so I said I would have soup and another breadstick, he said sorry we are only allowed to give one breadstick per USS deal. What? Really? Yep, if you want unlimited breadsticks you better head east to Olive Garden. I will say that it is a good deal for the $6.99 price, if you are a salad fanatic, then you will love the 8 varieties to choose from and the cup of soup is a hearty portion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=40
Anthony S.,"San Francisco, CA",36,15,,3.0,8/28/2012,"The Applebee's on Elliot is a Big NO for me. Service is very slow & they didn't even give me the correct amount of food I paid for! I will say that I do go to the Applebee's on 24th & Baseline quite frequently. It's good for a quick drink, food is average, service is ok! Go during non-busy hrs to avoid the crowd.

Greg M.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,190,100,3.0,12/30/2012,"It's applebees what can you expect. The server had too many tables, the drinks were slow due to the bartender serving too many guests.

Stacy G.,"Laveen, AZ",8,15,2,1.0,3/26/2012,This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier.

Ed P.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,76,34,2.0,1/4/2013,"Ok, it's been a while since I've been to any Applebee's (6+ years) but I think it will likely be longer before I go back again.  I brought my niece who was visiting Phoenix with her husband and kids figuring it would be easy for everyone to find something on the menu they could enjoy.  Things started out fine with the service and we ordered some appetizers.  Food order was taken and we were enjoying our visit.  It wasn't very busy but yet a different waiter brought out the first few dishes of lunch and asked ""who had the shrimp?""  Several of us ordered a shrimp dish but my niece said ""I had the wait watchers shrimp.""  ""Ahhh, this must be yours then"" said the waitress.  After a few bites my niece realized it was not the shrimp dish she ordered.  The remaining plates had still not arrived and we explained to the waitress the error when she delivered the remaining plates.  We asked for a new meal to be prepared for my wife and she left with the plate.  Now this is where it gets good.   Our waiter then comes back to our table with the original dish that my niece had eaten from and proceeds to place it in front of my wife saying ""this one's yours, right?'  We agreed that was what she ordered but that my niece had been mistakenly served the plate and had taken a few bites from it.  His response????  ""That's ok, your all family right?""  He seemed shocked we asked to have a fresh plate created.  Family or no family that is quite an assumption to be made!  My wife had never met this part of my family and being a registered nurse has a little thing about proper preparation, etc of food.  Wow, was all we could say.  He reluctantly went to the kitchen and 10 minutes later returned with a fresh (hopefully) dish. Food was ok but nothing to get us to overcome the odd service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=40

Waited 40 minutes on a Wednesday at 2 pm. there was a line out the door and only 3 tables were taken. no one came up to us for 15 minutes and he was rude and dirty. waitress was rude and had dirty fingernails. she kept sighing and grunting and would just throw stuff on our table. hamburger was served raw.

Alexis B.,"Sun City, AZ",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2013,"Applebees is a restaurant that serves American style food, such as burgers and salads and soups.  The food is mediocre and not the highest quality that I have ever had.  I went out to dinner with two friends before a movie we were going to see.  We had arrived an hour and a half earlier then the movie would start ensuring we would have enough time to eat and make it to the movie on time.  We were seated in a decent amount of time.  The server took about 20 minutes to come over to take our drink orders.  Once we had ordered, she came back 30 minutes later with our drinks.  At this point we were a little frustrated with the service.  We asked if we could order right away because we had a movie to get to and she was aware of this.  She took our order and said it would be out shortly.  We waited for 40 minutes before we started to get impatient.  After about 55 minutes we grabbed another waitress, since ours was no where to be found and asked her what was taking so long.  She said she would go check on our food for us and came back to inform us that our order had not even been placed.  We were furious.  I immediately went and complained to the manager about how horrible the service we had received was and how our waitress had taken over an hour and had not even placed our order.  The manager apologized profusely and said that she would get our meals out right away and that they would be on the house.  We were so angry and disappointed in the service and once our food was finally brought out we were continually disappointed by the low quality of the food.  Once we had finally left the movie had already started and we were forced to wait until the next showing of the movie.  Ever since that experience at Applebees,  I have not been back to the establishment and will never recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=40
Chilon K.,"Berkeley, CA",0,35,2,4.0,9/28/2011,Excellent Service. I am usually not a fan of Applebee's food. Of the corporate chain food restaurants Applebees has great deserts but usually below par for dinner entrees. But this Applebees has amazing service and an excellent staff. Definitely the best atmosphere of any restaurant in the area and definitely a much better bar than any in the area. I would recommend going here before any other Applebees from California to New York. The bar staff has excellent service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=40
Michelle S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,5,,1.0,9/11/2012,"Horrible... I ordered car side to go because I was in a hurry and thought it would be a good way to save time. I placed my order with a server who didn't know anything about the menu or lunch specials. I was told my order would be ready at 1:30 and asked what type of vehicle I drive. Pulled up in the car side spot around 1:40 and continued to sit in my car and wait another 8 minutes. Finally walked in the side door to a server who was standing there talking on the phone. He acknowledged me while still on the phone and I told him I was picking up an order to go. He looked at a few tickets and didn't bother to check the bag that was sitting right in front of him, said it would be a few minutes and then moved to another station to get on a personal phone call. Waiting another couple of minutes another server came out bringing drinks and asked what I needed. Finally he was able to get me my food that was sitting at the station the whole time. I let him know I was out there waiting 10 minutes and that there was another car there waiting too. This is just ridiculous whats the point of car side. I may be able to understand if it was busy but the place was dead and servers seem to care more about their personal phone calls then their customers agenda.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-phoenix-17?start=40
