3,JD M.,"Aiken, SC",88,89,171.0,4.0,2015-06-12,"As good as any Chili's around. It's going to be hard for any Chili's to get 5 stars from me, as much as I like the food. I started one of the first in FL back in the 80's when they were all about the chili, had 13 different burgers, tacos, and were the first to introduce fajitas to the world. Back then, there were no steaks and the fries came in a huge basket, not a tiny wire container.  Anyway, this is as good as a Chili's can be in its current iteration. The place is clean, the service is very friendly and it is what you'd expect from the chain these days. I noticed the Presidente margarita is smaller and so is the glass to drink it in from since back in 2000 when we got our own mixer and the recipe from the Chili's in Augusta.  Still a good place to eat compared to its competitors- Applebee's, Chi Chi's, etc.  The highlight is their new kiosks that let you pay your bill and leave when you are ready, rather than waiting on the check!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aiken-2,,,,,

2,Michael B.,"Charleston, SC",307,187,161.0,1.0,2016-03-10,"First off, I hate restaurants that use both servers and kiosks for ordering. This Chili's utilizes the tableside ordering system, but also has servers. I sat in the bar area, which I usually do. We were assigned a server, the bartender, who would come up to us and ask us what we want. She then told us we could ring it in on the kiosk. What's the point of a server? A lot of the time she wouldn't even come to our table, but rather talk across the bar to our booth. The food was typical chain restaurant food, which I can't complain about. You get what you pay for I guess. The server though was abysmal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aiken-2,,,,,
0,Big D.,"Aiken, SC",8,166,248.0,4.0,2017-08-05,"Went to Chili's for lunch. This was my first time at this location. We were greeted right away and given a booth. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu, and was attentive throughout our meal. I got one of the specials which had jalapeño sausage, ribs, Mexican corn, fries, and garlic bread. It was pretty good. We also got chips and salsa as an appetizer, which were also good. My wife and daughter liked their food as w Overall, the restaurant was clean, the service excellent, and the food pretty good. I'll come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aiken-2,,,,,
1,Jenny A.,"North Augusta, SC",0,16,,4.0,2017-11-20,"I love going out to eat at Chili's. This is usually reserved as a ""girls night out"" location, either with my friends or my daughters. This is my first time at the Aiken location. First of all, I want to say that on this particular occasion we went there with our softball team and their families. We completely mobbed them on a busy evening. We had to wait awhile, but we were all able to be seated together at different tables. You could see that the wait staff was a little confounded at first but they had a meeting and got a game plan going. Parents were sitting together and the girls were sitting together at other tables, and all the tickets were separate. The food was good, I believe I had the chicken quesadillas. Again, with our large party it did take some time to get our food but that was understandable. The waiter that served us was courteous and held it together in this stressful situation. He checked on us regularly & kept our drinks filled. I only had one complaint. The server that was assigned to my daughter's table was not nearly as professional as mine was. She had a bad attitude with the girls (who are loud but all of them are well behaved and have manners). She visibly would roll her eyes when my daughter would request something or ask a question, and she completely ignored her when she asked for a refill on her drink. I would still come here to eat. I think that she wouldn't have acted like that if my daughter had actually been seated with us. But my daughter is a customer just as I am and deserves to be treated with respect. Otherwise, I would have given a 5-star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aiken-2,,,,,
