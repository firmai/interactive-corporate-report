240,Kara M.,"Leesburg, VA",57,105,10.0,2.0,2012-01-06,"I've been here twice. First time was during the summer. We sat outside. Waitress was super nice. My usual cocktail and louisiana chicken pasta was awesome. The bf got filet also delicious.  Last night we visited because I desperately wanted some avocado egg rolls. From now on I will definitely be requesting a booth from the get go, so we don't have to walk to a squeezed in tiny table next to randoms (at which time I say oh actually we'd like a booth thanks...)  Sooo when our waiter came he seemed all rushed even though we hadn't been waiting long. He wreaked, obviously having just come back from a smoke break. Fab.  I decided to be adventurous and healthy so I ordered a barbecue chicken salad. Every ingredient in this thing looked and tasted like it came from a can. I know the portions are gigantic but that just made it worse... because this salad sucked.  The cheesecake slice that I always end up taking home was good though... Anyway from now on I will be less adventurous and may just end up getting take out to save all the hassle.  Oh and whatever other yelpers have said about parking in the take out spot seems to be true, because I watched someone walk out of LA fitness last night and over to their car parked in the Take Out spot. Nice. Parking sucks because everything noteworthy in this craptastic mall is crammed into the same area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=160,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.6960000000000006,3.1600000000000006

I know that the food is exactly the same at every restaurant, and that should lead me to question if it's really made fresh, or if they're just microwaved bags of food, BUT I can't help it. I like the Cheesecake Factory. I've liked it ever since the first time I went there back in like 1999 or whenever it was. I've liked every single one I've been to, including this one in Sterling. My wife and I go here about once every one or two months, and we always have a good time. The food is good, the service is good, the ambiance is good. I usually get the Jambalaya Chicken Pasta or the Pasta Da Vinci, or the Chicken Marsala. But really, almost everything on the menu is delicious, and it's always more than enough food.  The Cheesecake is five-star delicious every time. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle are two of my favorites, but I have yet to have a cheesecake there that wasn't really delicious. The Key Lime is good, but a little overpowering after the first couple of bights.

226,Rita M.,"Tallahassee, FL",232,174,9.0,2.0,2012-08-18,"For as celebrated of a chain as it is, I am not sure I understand the Cheesecake Factory hype. The dinner menu is extremely monotonous. I went with the chicken alla panna and it was kind of tasteless and dull. I enjoyed the heaping side of mashed potatoes it came with but that should hardly be the high point of a dish. The cheesecakes were extremely tasty, albeit so dwarfed by mountains of whipped cream that I had to scrape off some of the topping to enjoy the actual cake. I wish they would add a fruit element to the vanilla bean cheesecake because it gets super sweet and one-dimensional after a few bites. Two stars off because out waiter looked like he truly hated his existence on Earth and was sweating uncontrollably.

Service was okay; our server disappeared from times to times and had to ask him to refill our waters. The calamari appetizer was pretty tasty and was never disappointed with it. Our favorite entrée has always been the chicken marsala pasta. Their cheesecakes were pretty yummy as well.  However, our entrees this time was very unappetizing. My girlfriend got the wasabi crusted ahi tuna and I got the hibachi steak. My girlfriend said her ahi tuna was very mushy and wasn't fresh. My hibachi steak (which I have had numerous times and was delicious) was missing the sauce, it was just the steak itself and I had to ask for the sauce separately later.

The only complaint I have about Cheesecake Factory is that their tables are soooo close together, its a bit awkward.  (they all are like this, this location is nothing different)   I had the ahi tuna appetizer and arugula salad for dinner the other night.

The appetizer dishes are even sized like regular entrees here, so if you want to leave room for a cheesecake slice or two, beware.  Since the menu is so large, I've been trying not to eat the same thing twice, SO, I can only say that I've never been disappointed.  I wish I could describe my favorites to you, but really, you just have to go and see for yourself.  This place isn't some 'out of this world' restaurant, but it's a definite stand by, especially if you're craving cheese cake.   The cheesecakes I've tried:  banana cream, red velvet, chocolate mousse, dulce de leche, vanilla bean, pineapple upside down, caramel pecan turtle, carrot cake.  That's quite a list!  They're all good and of course it all depends on what you're craving but the banana cream cheesecake ranks high up there for me.  :)  They're creamy and really FULL of flavor.  They're so sweet your teeth are likely going to hurt after one bite.  I don't think I've ever finished a slice due to the richness. The service is good, I've not had bad service here yet and I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factories.  They don't have call ahead seating or even take reservations, so be prepared to go there for an early (before 7) or late (an hour or two before closing) dinner; if not, you might be in for a long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=140,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006

The server acknowledged the request but the bread never came.  We had to flag down our server 25 minutes later while we were already half way into our meals and made a second request for some bread.  The server nods and came back with a basket of bread 10 minutes later (to which we had just finished our meal).  Not once did the server ask how our meal was.  We had to flag down the server to order our desserts.  The dirty plates were left on our table for a good 15 minutes until our desserts finally arrived.  We also had to wait a long time to get and pay for our check.  While the server is a nice guy, he seems inexperienced and very preoccupied which made it very difficult for us to enjoy our dinner.  Being a family of three, we had expected to be in and out of the restaurant within an hour however we ended up sitting in the restaurant for over 2 and a half hours, mainly waiting for our server.  We are extremely disappointed with tonight's dinner service at the Cheesecake Factory and wished we had chosen another restaurant for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=220,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.6920000000000006,3.0400000000000005

Hence the name Cheesecake Factory, if you're hungry for one of their exclusive cheesecakes, I recommend the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  My family and I have tried a few others, but none of them are like the Oreo Dream Extreme, with layers of fudge cake and Oreo cookie mousse, topped with milk chocolate icing and an Oreo cookie!  Not only that, for every slice of Oreo Dream Extreme you have, 25 cents is donated to Feeding America.  Imagine enjoying yourself for dessert while helping hungry families in America.

It can be a bit pricey but they give very generous portions. I always leave with a doggy bag; enough for a full lunch the next day.  We never usually order appetizers because we get trashed off of the honey-wheat bread they bring out and by the time the food comes I can only eat like 4 bites, then it's in the doggy bag. This time we ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. They were pretty delicious. It comes with julienned carrots, beans sprouts, grilled chicken (which honestly they could've given us a little more of for 3 people), noodles, and three different sauces: Thai chili, which was sweet but missing the spicy. A green sauce which was sweeter than the thai chili sauce and peanut sauce. The wraps were very good and a light appetizer to start off with.  I ended up getting my usual, BBQ salmon. The salmon is always juicy and the amount of sauce they put on it is just right. It comes with a side of corn succotash but I always swap that out with steamed broccoli. Nom! The roasted red potatoes and thin crispy red onion straws just complete the dish.

There has only been two or three occasions where my wife and I didn't have the normal standards that we are accustomed to during our many visits. However this wasn't as bad as most places because the service and management are willing to do whatever they can to resolve any issue with our respective meals. For instance they would either subtract that meal item from our bill or prepare a fresh order. I have tried many different food items here but a majority of my visits I find myself defaulting to the Famous Factory Meatloaf which is hmmmmm hmmmm good. Also just a heads up for you health conscious folks that the portions are huge so be sure to pay attention to what you're ordering.  However on this particular occasion I decided to be a bit more healthy so I ordered from their skinnylicious menu.

Location-wise, this particular copy is great. It's convenient to all things related to Dulles Town Center and Sterling, with tons of easy mall parking, and it's standalone, so you don't have to deal with the throng of people inside the mall itself. We've always experienced friendly, efficient, and accurate service here, which is much more than I can say for the Fair Oaks and Tyson's Corner locations. On our last visit, during one of the many ""polar vortex"" nights of 2014, when most restaurants were closing doors early, CF remained open, and even though they were short-staffed, our waitress, Amy, was great.  For those who have a geographic choice as we do in selecting among the Dulles/Fair Oaks/Tyson's locations, we always choose Dulles, especially on the weekends. They just seem to run a tighter ship here all-around, and waiting times are either non-existent or shorter than other nearby locations. Helpful to know if you run with a ""hangry"" bunch during weekend meal times. That's ""hungry""+""angry"", FYI :) Okay, so more detail on my ""beef"" with Cheesecake Factory as a whole, if you're still reading (since we've gone over the nuts and bolts of this particular location). In 2014, it blows my mind that there is still a chain restaurant that REFUSES to publish their ingredients and nutritional information. That irks the hell out of me, as an 80%-of-the-time very health-conscious eater and having a member of my family with an allergy to a certain ingredient, it's irritating to say the least. We want to enjoy CF, as their food is pretty tasty, prices fair, and menu expansive, but it's almost as though they have ""something to hide"" in not disclosing their full modus operandi.  I realize they offer the (deceptively) ""Skinnylicious"" menu, but only offer that the items are ""under XYZ calories,"" but what about fat/carbs/sodium/etc.? They would probably attract even more folks such as myself who would seek out a special ""healthy"" menu if they were to disclose ingredients, portion sizes, and full nutritionals. Okay, rant over. I remember eating at CF for pre-Prom dinner one year in high school, and although my days of carelessly indulging in their cheesecake are over, I do enjoy their breakfast/brunch items and salads, especially the Tuna Tataki Salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=80,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8640000000000003,3.4800000000000004

Ohmygosh, I've had tuna tartare at high end restaurants in D.C. that don't even compare to the one here. I'm serious guys. As for the Vietnamese summer rolls, four words of advice: do not get it.

The rice paper wrapper was hard and cold...like it had been pre-made and was waiting in the fridge for us to order.  We sent it back and received another one with the same issue which makes me think it's how the food is made. For our entree, we got the BBQ salmon that I thought was just okay. My boyfriend though enjoyed it very much. It was served over a corn salsa and a side of mash potatoes.

Yet, despite being a mid-tier chain restaurant that doesn't specialize in anything, CF tries to act like a super-classy hotspot for cuisine. In reality, it's become not much more than a place known for an OK happy hour and oversized portions. Don't get me wrong, there are certain dishes I find really good -- such as CF's orange chicken. But it's not worth dealing with the CF 'experience' for when several actual Chinese places do it better and cheaper. And of course, the main event, the cheesecake, is amazing -- but that's a once-a-year treat no one's waistline dares have regularly. On my most recent visit to the Dulles location, I was instantly annoyed. Despite half the restaurant being open (it was a Tuesday night after happy hour for crying out loud), the hostess quoted a 10-minute wait. is that supposed to make CF seem fancier? Because instead it just makes it annoying and inefficient. At least hide the empty tables from my view. Don't have enough people to staff them? At least let me go ahead and sit down with some bread and a Coke. (Oh, and plan better.) The service was fine. The food was fine. I'd never had pizza from CF (have had just about everything else and wanted to mix it up). The pizza reminded me of a DiGiorno. The crust seemed to indicated a previously frozen dough, and the cheese and sauce had that cafeteria-quality flavor. The toppings varied slightly from what was in the menu description, and the mushrooms and veggies were seriously underrepresented. The meats, however - pepperoni and sausage -- were piled high.

I love the cheescake but the food is always hit or miss.  The menu is so big that even if you order the same thing twice it always ends up being a different dish.  I think they should scale back the menu and put more focus into fewer dishes.

76,Sean P.,"Ashburn, VA",70,180,65.0,4.0,2014-07-30,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory (even if I never really get Cheesecake). It's not perfect, but it's always reliable and there's definitely something for everyone on the menu. Speaking of menus, that's exactly the strength and weakness of the Factory. There literally IS something for everyone, but there are so many menu options, choices, variations and choices that if you're even remotely decisive you may ultimately have an aneurism just trying to figure out what you want. Not only that, but every other page in the menu is an ad. What's with that? I'm looking for food, not perfume. Stop that! Further, I don't want to ""accessorize"" my meal with Diet Coke. The wording is very irksome to me for some reason, BUT that's a pet peeve/personal issue. How's the food? Great! Love it. The food is solid, and I've never had anything bad there. I think my favorite dish is the chicken and biscuits. It's massively feeling (and very rich) but I love sharing it with my wife. The flat breads are pretty good, too. The pasta carbonara is also a favorite of mine, too. Again, it's a heartstopper and rich as can be, but delicious! There's so many amazing options that trying to pick one is (again) half the problem. And yes, the cheesecake IS good (though I rarely get it). The portion sizes are so large for main courses that, between the bread, apps and main course I barely make it half way through the meal before I start getting full. All in all: It's pretty good. I'd give it four stars, but the overwhelming menu and the constant advertising is really distracting/frustrating for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.6719999999999997,3.2400000000000007

Our waitress was very unfriendly. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day, but her greeting had no eye contact or smile. She was sick of us before she even took our order. We ordered two alcoholic beverages, which took way too long to come to the table. We also ordered an appetizer that took 20 minutes to get. Our waitress said she ""is not sure what is going on with with kitchen today"" but she let her manager know that we had to wait  too long for a single appetizer. The appetizer was good (chicken potstickers); however, I cannot say the same for my Salmon Salad. The salad was grossly overdressed and the salmon was in one huge chunk slapped on top. Not very appealing. When our entrees came we requested from the food runner that we get some bread (our waitress never brought us any). He said enthusiastically ""Sure! No problem!"" He was never to be seen again. We would have asked our waitress, but we didn't see her again until after we finished our meal (at which point she filled our empty water glasses with warm water). We noticed that the tables around us were also getting poor service. The table next to us had to order another round of drinks because their first round of mojitos were wrong. The waitress immediately blamed the bartender saying ""he is new"" and took no personal responsibility for the mess up or the wait time. They finally got their drinks after they closed their tab and finished their meal. We were going to order dessert, but really we just wanted to get out of there.

A waitress pushed me out of her way while I was holding my baby just to get to the cheesecake counter while I was waiting to put my name on the list to be seated. The obviously annoyed manager couldn't follow the lines order and put anybody's name on the list that pushed to the front. I will say the only pleasant part of the night was our patient waiter Noah P. He took his time while taking our order. I ordered something that wasn't on the printed menu and my husband had questions about his meal. He never seemed unwilling to help even though the place was slammed and his other table was obviously giving him a hard time about canceling their order after their food was already made. You would think yummy cheesecake would make the night better until we got in line and witnessed the cheesecake server eat the carrot cake crumbs with his gloved hand and then prepare someone else's cheesecake while wearing his saliva coated glove and chomping his gums. We got out of line after that. I've worked in the food industry before and I get it.

Granted the size of our group, and the fact that we WERE NOT allowed to book reservations, we were told there was about an hour wait, just outside the restaurant. It wouldn't have been so bad being that we were with our dates and could take pictures, but it was 2-1/2 HOURS before we were seated! Noisy atmosphere, sluggish service: The atmosphere was faux-classy. Very noisy and crowded and busy. Our orders were taken as quickly as one could expect for 20 people I suppose, but it was still slow. We waited an hour for our food, I'm not sure if that's normal for them or not. It came in generously large portions on nice platters, I'll give them that. Very sweet food! (Not in the good way): I ordered the cashew chicken, thinking it would be spicy as stated, but it wasn't at all! It may be that I'm used to spice, but I think even someone with mild taste would not find it spicy. Much less ""very spicy"" as described in their menu. It was more sweet than anything but it wasn't ""bad"", just not my preference. I couldn't finish the portion even on an empty stomach and I didn't box it up. My boyfriend ordered teriyaki which was even sweeter! Seems to me there is an odd pattern in their menu. Neither of us were ecstatic about our meals. Even MORE waiting!! I think this was the worse part. The service only continued to slow down. my boyfriend and I waited for the check for at least half an hour, waited for it to be collected for another 20 minutes, and he didn't receive back his card and receipt for another hour! This was notorious. I had other things I wanted to do with my night. Even among friends I was growing antsy. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to pay a bill! In conclusion: We were there for a total of FIVE HOURS! At least three and a half of those were from unnecessary waiting alone! I understand 20 people is a lot but that gives no excuse for their slow slow slow service. We could've at least been given a discount or something. And the food wasn't good enough to be waiting that long. I will not be returning to this location any time soon, or at least not with as many people. Granted I would like to try a couple more menu items, I may be retesting their serving skills after a year or so. One more waiting session or sweet meal and I'm done.

As for their cheesecake, it's stellar, you could probably talk me into buying a single piece for $15. I wish the Cheesecake Factory only sold cheesecake and did away with the rest of the menu.

We only went one time to get cheesecake for dessert.  I ordered the combo dinner: the Herb Salmon and Steak Dianne. Hubby ordered the huge chicken burrito dish. First off, both our meals were cold. The chicken in hubby's burrito was tough.  As for my meal... Let's start with the steak. I ate a small piece and thought it tasted weird. I figured maybe it was the sauce. I asked hubby to try a small piece. He spit it out and said it was spoiled. So, I spit out the second small piece I just put in my mouth. The salmon came with mashed potato and asparagus which were actually okay except that they were cold.  Our server came to our table and asked us how our meals are. We told him about the steak. He went to get his manager.  The manager came and he took my plate away with the spoiled steak. We decided to just go with the Herb Salmon when he asked us if I wanted the same dish. He said he'll get me a fresh order of the Herb Salmon.  My husband decided not to say anything about his burrito. He probably ate not even a quarter of the the whole thing. The chicken was that tough for him.  They finally came back with my salmon. I wasn't a big fan of the lemony sauce that came with it. We ended up just taking our food home. We ordered our cheesecakes to go, which they gave us for free.  Hubby ended up throwing the leftover burrito the next day.   It's nice that they have a huge variety of dishes but if you're starving, you better know what you want before you go there otherwise, you'll get a headache from hunger trying to figure what to order from their novel-like menu.

We were there shortly after 5 p.m. on a Sunday.  The place was busy but there were still empty tables.  We were lead to a booth by the friendly hostess.  Our server came along shortly, before we even had time to look at the menu.  We asked her to come back in a bit.  When she came back, I gave my food and drink order.  I ordered a glass of lemonade plus ""Renee's special"" which consists of: 1/2 sandwich, salad and soup.  The soup of the day (and the only soup they have) was sweet chicken soup. So far, so good...then my husband ordered.  He ordered a glass of Yuengling and a turkey club.  They didn't have any turkey.  I asked the server why that was and mentioned how Tysons didn't have it either.  She said they hadn't had any turkey in a long time because there was a turkey shortage.  Then I asked her why they didn't remove turkey items from the menu or at least clip a note to the menu.  She said because they expect to have it again at some point.  My husband then told her that he would need more time to pick out something else. Meanwhile, we figured that we, at least, would get our drinks...but no.  People who came in after us were getting their drinks.  The server came back to take my husband's food order.  He ordered the old fashioned burger and didn't want a side with it. Then the server made herself scarce---still no drinks.  Finally, I caught her eye and asked about the drinks.  She apologized and blamed the bartender (really?)  but she then got the drinks It took less time to get our food to us.  My husband was served a burger and a roll with no toppings.  He asked the food runner about that and the runner offered to bring him some lettuce, tomato and onion.  That came quickly but instead of lettuce, there was shredded cabbage. My dinner was okay.  The 1/2 sandwich was chicken salad with almonds.  the salad was mixed greens dressed in a vinaigrette.  The sweet chicken soup wasn't too bad as it was creamy with a generous amount of chicken in it.  The lemonade was actually good---more on the sweet side and with a sugared rim on the glass. The whole experience left us feeling annoyed.   If they don't have any turkey items at any Cheesecake Factory, at least fix the menu in some way to reflect that.   As we were leaving, my husband said to me, ""Remind me to never go here again.""  I most certainly will do that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=20,3.08,3.06,3.06,2.504,3.0680000000000005

28,Amanda G.,"Herndon, VA",219,279,8.0,2.0,2016-05-31,"Not a fan of that ridiculously large menu. For someone who has a hard time making decisions, it's very daunting.  Our waiter was strange...he had a VERY sharp, brusque personality that could have been almost joking, but nobody thought he was. He gave an air of pure impatience and annoyance, each time he spoke to us we were left speechless with his demeanor, not sure if he was making jabs at us or if that's just the way he is. It made me feel pressured into making a decision and I made some that I sincerely regret. I would have had a much better review to write if it weren't for his attitude...we thought about asking to be moved to a different section but we really loved the seat we ended up in so we thought we could deal with it. I regret not moving. Drinks: I got the Pineapple Moscow Mule which for some odd reason came in a large glass instead of a mule mug, and it was watered down by all the ice within mere minutes and I had to chug it to get my money's worth. It was tasty but would have been much tastier with an actual mule mug, if you don't want to spend the money on the right drinkware don't offer the drink! They also don't list the prices of their drinks which I'm not a fan of.  Food: For an appetizer I chose potstickers (a rushed decision because I felt I was taking up our waiters time) and they were mediocre at best. My friends liked them but I was not impressed. They got some kind of avocado egg roll which was really a guacamole egg roll, they enjoyed it but I thought it was too much. We came in seeking brunch which they did not offer on a Monday, I kind of figured that would happen, but found it odd that they didn't just include the brunch menu items with their breakfast menu since they already offer a ridiculous amount of dishes. Their breakfast menu was almost all omelettes and a sandwich, which I got (again, not really in the mood for it but the waiter was putting the pressure on for me to decide) and it was a big waste. The sandwich tasted fine but it was ENORMOUS (I learned all of their dishes are extremely over portioned) and I took two bites before just giving up. It was just not what I wanted and was terrified of asking for something else because of our waiter's extreme personality. It was partially my fault for not having the, er, gumption to ask for more time to make a decision but the times he did come back he would say something to the extent of ""did you FINALLY decide on something??"" how can you expect anyone to make a snappy decision on a menu with hundreds of choices?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=40,2.88,3.02,3.02,2.3440000000000003,2.9640000000000004

We'd like our veggie burgers to approximate a real burger experience. This didn't. The hubby's fries were very good. He said his burger was average. I really like the atmosphere.

Being new ish vegans were not really sure about who serves what and how the heck you're supposed to eat out when everything seems to be smothered in cheese or butter. Turns out this place could very well be vegan paradise. At first glance we had our choice of basically 6 salads- sans cheese and croutons. But on closer look- this menu is super easy to navigate and lots of leave the meat off options are available. We got the flatbread with basil and tomato no cheese for an app, it was small but delicious. The fresh table bread came with butter which our waitress happily subbed with olive oil- for lunch I went with the vegan salad, cliche but delicious and so huge I couldn't finish it it had asparagus, cooked radish, lettuce quinoa, spinach, sunflower seeds cashews- oh lord it was a mountain of nuts and veggies drowning in some delicious house balsamic vinaigrette that was so good you could wipe it on your face and not be mad! - So the fries we ordered were awesome but the meals were so big they're coming home with us! Ok so, hub ordered the veggie burger which was suspect we weren't sure about the egg dilemma on this one- it's clean! No egg! It was FREAKIN HUGE! Delicious and I was kinda jealous that I didn't order it. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a vegan meal that's going to offer you more than just a side salad of ice burg hold everything else that comes on it at that place you usually have to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=60,2.8,2.88,2.88,2.548,2.848
23,Diana S.,"Tucson, AZ",8,33,19.0,2.0,2017-02-07,"First off let me start by saying I love Cheesecake Factory. However the one in Dulles has 3 times now been disappointing! First visit my salmon was ""burnt"" so they had to remake it. We were on our way to work and don't get to eat our food because it took so long. Manager did say sorry and brought us the new one. We were just beside ourselves like it was no big deal. Sidebar- they weren't busy. Oh well can't win em all.  Next time I was by myself came to bar and had stuffed mushrooms (Delish) and 2 drinks. The bartender a light skinned guy with long braids was bar tending. He seemed less than interested in serving me or the other patrons aside from two younger people who he clearly knew. My thought was what bartender has this much attitude with out even talking to you. I asked for check and left without finishing my second drink. Tonight I am sitting here and the same bartender is here. I walk up and the bar is cluttered with empty glasses and trash. I go to the further end and ask if the seats are open, he states no I think they went outside. Now the signed CC slip and the empty glasses told a different story. So I squeeze oddly between two young men  and another woman sitting by herself. Needless to say the seat I wanted was empty no one ever came back and sat. Back to story. He asks what I want to drink. I get a tea he sets it down and walks off. Just an attitude like I am lucky he is serving me. Never offers me a menu. So luckily I wanted my foto miso salmon. So as he ignores me more. I finally say excuse me may I order the miso salmon. It comes he never asks how it was. The brown rice was undercooked. It made me sad 2 times now I came in for my favorite dish and 2 times I didn't eat. I say may I get this boxed up and he says I can give you a box. So I packed up my salmon and began to write this post. Who ever this bartender is he should learn that a job in customer service means you have to offer customer service... talk to your customers... smile.. if he is too talented for this position maybe he should move on instead of making my dinner unenjoyable. I think I will stick to the fairfax location as they have never let me down... sorry folks but if you are looking for the consistent delicious Cheesecake Factory you are used to don't go to the one at Dulles mall....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=40,2.76,2.89,2.89,2.152,2.838

Finally when someone did come, she brought us bread which rock hard, then took another several minutes to bring our drinks. I asked if she could move us to another location that was quieter, which I asked for when they first sat us and they told us that all the other tables were reserved, but also told us we cannot reserve tables which was really confusing. She ended up taking us somewhere quieter which I appreciated. Later on another server came to our table to take our order. She wasn't very friendly and didn't greet us, just took the order. We got our food later and there was bones in my boyfriends chicken tortillas, and my chicken was hard. My boyfriend and I asked if there were suppose to be bones and she said no, asked if we wanted another one, we said no thank you, then she just walked away and didn't say anything.

The waitress took our drink and food orders. When the drinks came, the waitress set my boyfriend's beer down on a plate causing it to fall over and break the glass. Glass and beer went everywhere, including all over my jeans. The waitress asked if she did that, attempting to take the blame away from her, but barely apologized. She offered to move us to a different table, but for whatever reason, she made us wait for a table to be cleaned when there was an open one right next to it. We sit down and she asks if we need more silverware...we had used the napkins to try to wipe down the beer and she asked after everything had been already cleared from the table we left...so unless we plan on eating with our hands, yes we do. We waited several minutes, but she did not come check on us or bring over bread. I got the attention of the manager and told him what had happened. I said that we are waiting on our bread and I would like them to take care of the cost of the beer considering I was wearing it. He said he would take care of it. As I expected, the bread came out seconds before the food. I hadn't even buttered my piece before having to make room for my plate.

I should've read other reviews before coming in here, I know..my mistake. The hostesses wasn't very welcoming or friendly sadly but I easily over looked that because she wouldn't be the one serving us.  Once we got seated a woman took our drink order - strawberry lemonade & a sprite. About 10 minutes go by, no drink, no waitress, but yet a different girl comes up and asks for our drink order.. okay ""Strawberry Lemonade & Sprite"" again. We finally got our drinks and the first girl, she finally took our order. We got cheesy garlic bread, Caesar salad, & two lunch pasta dishes.  Now, we wait again. 20 minutes go by we finally get our appetizer and salad. Our waitress didn't even bring it out, it was yet again a different girl. By this time we've had 3 different waitresses.  We also got bread with our meal which wasn't very good at all. The best part was the cheesy garlic bread. About 10-15 minutes after our appetizer, our main meal finally came out. Meanwhile the people beside us who got there after us had already ate and left. The food wasn't anything to brag about. I got the four cheese pasta. It was honestly kind of bland and lacked salt. I also wasn't a fan of the huge ball of ricotta cheese just slapped in the middle. It wasn't very appetizing. The pasta was cooked well though I thought, it wasn't too mushy like a lot of places cook their pasta.  Once we were done eating my husband wanted a box for his so the other girl who wasn't our waitress came by and asked if we needed a box & I also told her to get our check. We had already been waiting 20 minutes for our original waitress to bring our check at that point. Our original waitress comes back and says I'll get you a box & the check. I told her someone else already went to get it. She rolled her eyes and said well I will get it too just in case. The other girl came back with a box & the check. Then right after, our original waitress came and acted surprised we got the box and check. Like HELLO we just told you someone else was getting it. She rolled her eyes and walked away. Not even a have a good day, nothing.  Needless to say we paid with cash because we weren't waiting for another 30 minutes to get our card back. I don't understand the hype for this place.

Also their clothing was a bit much it's not a night club.  Our waitress was an older woman who talked so much she forgot to put my order in! The appetizer (pot stickers) we got were terrible! 20 mins go by and my friends food comes out. Then 10 more minutes go by and the waitress comes over and asked how everything was... then quickly notice she didn't put my food in.  All I ordered was grilled chicken, broccoli , and mash potatoes! Another 10 mins go by and she ask if carrots are okay instead of broccoli, which shows she clearly didn't attend/pay attention to their pre-shift. I also had a Cesar salad that just tasted like romaine tossed with water.  My food finally comes out! The chicken is burnt on the outside but one taste and it was clear it was STILL RAW! The mash potatoes were cold and the carrots were hot but lacked flavor. Lastly our server had an attitude when my friend asked for a birthday dessert for me. We then ask for to-go cups and get plastic ramekins  I felt like I was being punked  At this point we're annoyed with the serves and the food was garbage! We express this to the sever and she gets a manager to comp my friends salad. We thought maybe the manager would have come by the table but no one ever did.  After we paid the server NEVER returned. We were trying to get to-go cups so we asked the host, who told us to go to the pastry counter to ask for cups.  We go there and the cashier had such a nasty attitude, she slammed 2 plastic cups down without lids. Clearly we had asked for to-go cups but she was bothered.  We finally locate a manager who said that she had just walked in at 4 but the funny thing is we saw her on the patio talking to serves when we walked by to come in (90mins prior) We expressed our issues and all we got was an ""I'm sorry""  On the 30th I woke up at 2am vomiting and had a fever of 103 I was so weak to the point my husband had to pick me up and carry me to the car and get help moving my body once at the ER! I'm 5 months pregnant and it was terrifying to be that sick and not being able to eat for days to nourish my baby broke my heart!  I contacted my friend to see how she was and she told me she had just been released from the hospital because she had food poisoning!  So I call a few days later to inform the managers and I got yet again another attitude, the female manager said ""well no one else got sick so"" and I told her I have the paperwork from the hospital and so does my friend. I was told corporate would be calling us within 24 hours and now it's June 14!  I've been a server/bartender for years and I've never seen such horrible customer service from the host all the way to the manager!

She also took initiative to package our cheesecakes ahead of time.  The Cheesecake Factory was one of those chains that I dined at back in college. It's burgers, pizza, salads, pastas, entrees, fusion foods, and cheesecake at reasonable prices with huge portions for now and for later. We eat here now because the food is still delicious and there's a little bit of something for everyone. My husband likes to bring his coworkers from Mexico and Europe here.

Then when we went to check out with the cashier, Lan Chi L, my wife had another question. ""What are all the new cheesecakes?"" This question was answered in a hurry and not completely answered, followed by a rude ""are you ready?"" Once we ordered one cheesecake, we felt rushed by Lan Chi L, although there was no line. We also had a family member from out of the country with us and we wanted him to get a cheesecake. We ended up ordering 6 cheesecakes and then were told they all would not be half price. Only one per person. Because we were unaware of that we decided to order one cheesecake each. We were all rushed to order and were asked if that was all, after each item we ordered. Not great customer service.  Lan Chi L clearly did not want to be at work this morning, but she did not need to be rude to us.

44,Ali E.,"Arlington, VA",36,25,7.0,1.0,2017-08-27,This was the worst experience I've ever had at a cheesecake factory. We were seated immediately and given waters and a bread basket. It was 35 minutes before our waitress returned to ask if we wanted something else to drink and if we were ready to order. The tables around us that arrived at the same we did we're receiving food while we ordered. Our waitress never refilled our drinks or asked if we needed more bread. 50 minutes later we received our food and refills. Our food was warm but not hot. We waited another 20 minutes before spotting our waitress to flag our waitress down to request the check. If the waitress had been friendly or apologetic for our delay I wouldn't have minded the wait so much. Unfortunately our waitress acted inconvenienced by even having to take our order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=20,2.44,2.8,2.8,,2.656

It was so crowded loud, and the employees behind the counter could have cared less. If I wasn't getting these for someone, I would have left but I waited to be greeted.  Finally someone looks up and helps me, br co to use on with their task for another 5minutes before I get the cheesecake I had already ordered.  Upon return to the house there was a fly. a FLY on the cheesecake. I wasn't going to drive back there because I was treated so poorly. Horrible quality control.

7,Eddie B.,"Ashburn, VA",88,77,1362.0,5.0,2017-10-17,"We absolutely love the happy hour here. It's only at the bar area which has high top tables a few regular tables. The servers are usually friendly. The happy hour includes 2 or 3 draft beer options for about $4. They bring out a bread basket of tasty white and dark bread. The happy hour food menu is one of the best ones around when it comes to options. There a quite a few things you can order for a very good price between $5 and $8. Some of these item include guacamole, spinach dip, southwest egg rolls, mini chicken sandwiches, tuna tartar, foot long hot dog, hamburger, chicken lettuce wraps, pot stickers, flat breads, fried Mac and cheese balls and more. You can add fries to the burger and hot dog for like an additional $2 and it's totally worth it. Everything tastes very good. We always have a good experience here for a fairly good price. The cheesecake is not on the happy hour menu and is about $8 but it's delicious. It's one of the tastiest cheesecakes you can get around here.

WE WERE DONE! I call a manager to our table, and these are his exact words: ""I apologize for this guys, we are roach infested and we clean every Monday, but it is the time of year. You know how it is right? We spray every Monday and the problem won't go away."" UMMMMM MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS: WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER HAD ROACHES!

0,Olivia M.,"Herndon, VA",0,13,215.0,4.0,2017-11-30,"My second visit to an outlet from the Cheesecake Factory chain and it was as good as the first except for the service again. Too many guests and not enough servers. Food and cheesecake however is the highlight of the visit every time. We ordered chicken samosa - sort of an Indian appetiser. Wheat flour , deep fried (triangle shaped) wrapped minced chicken mixed with spices. Filling was a bit dry. chicken burger - served with yummy French fries the burger was absolutely delicious and quite filling. Shrimp scampi - Succulent fresh juicy Prawns  cooked to perfection sautéed in lemon  and garlic butter  served with Angel  hair pasta  and asparagus  The Chef who invented this tantalising combination gets a big hug from me . Moreover this was from the skinilicious menu, only 590 calories  Dessert - Chocolate truffle cake  wow  this was so Chocolatey and delicious  a must have for all chocolate lovers  chocolate  Our server was warm and good with suggestions but since the restaurant was crowded he wasn't able to give us a lot of attention.

1,Billy L.,"Falls Church, VA",19,36,12.0,1.0,2017-12-19,"I've been here a few times a while back & never had any issues. Recently though, I went with my wife & son and the service was a disaster. After being seated & waiting for about 10 minutes with NO ONE greeting us despite multiple servers walking by, so I took it upon myself to go to the bar to get everyone drinks. Finally, our sever comes over. I've worked in restaurants/bars for over a decade & I know that things happen, so I'm expecting an apology and/or explanation as to why we had to wait so long & run our own drinks. Nope. A quick, listless hello & ""Are you ready to order?"" was our greeting. Alrighty, then. We order, have to ask a DIFFERENT server for some bread since our server was nowhere to be found, get our bread, & a runner brings the app. When our entree comes, my wife's dish was missing a sauce. After waiting for a few minutes with the server again nowhere to be found, I went to the host stand to see about correcting our order. Finally, as we're finishing our meal, the server comes over to see how everything is going. I'm pissed at this point, so I just say ""fine"" to move things along so we can leave. I figured my critiques would fall on deaf ears, so I'll fill out the survey later.  Skip ahead a few days later, post-survey, I get an email from the GM, Shawn, which is a nice, quick response. He apologized for the problems we had, offered a gift card, & even called me to discuss and get details on our visit. We chat for a bit, I give my two cents on things, & we end the call. A few weeks later, it dawns on me that I never received a gift card, so I send Shawn an email inquiring about it. I felt weird doing it as I didn't want to appear to be complaining to try and get something for free, but the feeling of being slighted overwhelmed that weirdness. He replied back that the gift card will be ""mailed from our corporate headquarters in Calabasas, California. Usually takes 5-10 business days"". THAT reply was a couple of weeks ago, so I'm doubtful I'll see it. That weirdness I was talking about earlier makes it awkward to broach the subject with him AGAIN, so I figured I'd vent my frustrations here.  TL;DR - Good food, crap service. Oblivious server & zero attempt made at recovery. General Manager didn't follow thru on promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles,2.72,2.7,2.7,,2.708
