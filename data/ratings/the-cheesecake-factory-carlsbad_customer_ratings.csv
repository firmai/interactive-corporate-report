5,Emma J.,"Carlsbad, CA",731,369,1110.0,5.0,2017-11-11,"I love Cheesecake Factory & so happy we now have one in Carlsbad. Our group was luckily treated to a complimentary dinner before they officially opened doors to the public, and everything was just perfect. One of the best things about Cheesecake Factory is the consistency between locations, and Carlsbad is already keeping up. Every dish came out looking and tasting delicious. Service is extremely friendly. Staff goes above & beyond to take care of guests, and we were even gifted complimentary slices of cheesecakes to-go - does it get better than that?! The city of Carlsbad shuts down pretty early, but fortunately Cheesecake Factory stays open til 11pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends. I'm also looking forward to trying their weekend brunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644
130,Gibson B.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,2.0,5.0,2017-11-12,"How cool is it to have a Cheesecake Factory in Carlsbad? We have been fans since the 1980s and we were regulars in the Marina Del Rey and West Palm Beach locations, but having one here now is awesome this is by far one of the nicest restaurants in the city. If you are arguing over who wants what to eat, this is the place. The menu is an encyclopedia of edible wonders. We were treated to Gold Tickets for the training opening and we were completely delighted. The consistency is always there at CHeesecake but they were jumping through hoops to see that we had a perfect day, as well as those around us. The place was buzzing with energy. Our server Eric was training and what he lacked in beer knowledge he more than made up for with being just as nice as a person could be. He had a pro from another location named Jeremy who clearly knew what the program was and was proud to offer it up. Even the folks from other locations were amped. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (my all time fav). The serving was so big I ate half the night we came home for dinner and the other half of the left overs in the middle of the night last night. LOt's of fresh shrimp and tender chicken with tri-colored buttery pasta, holy smokes I can't wait till Tuesday and their grand opening. MY wife had an Asian Chicken Salad (another Cheesecake classic) my daughter had the Orange Chicken, truly one of the best I have ever had. The chicken is first cooked to perfection in a light batter but the real deal with this dish is it is fresh orange. You can taste the zest. Nothing fake, all real and simple the very very best. We had lettuce wraps for starters. Many perfect butter leafs with sprouts, carrots, perfectly grilled chicken sa-tay and other fun stuff to wrap in them and some delicious sauces peanut, chili and chimichurri .  Dessert was of course cheesecake and as always it lived up to it's reputation for being some of the very finest in the world. Yummy Key LIme Mango and also a 30th Anniversary Chocolate we finished neither between three of us, but we sure did that night.  Phillip from  the Cerritos location was like a conductor seeing that all ran efficiently and covering all the new waiters. Looking around we could see many happy customers eating dishes I can't wait to get my hands on. The place is run by a sharp friendly guy Mark the General Manager. Another Marina Del Rey transplant who managed to keep an incredibly busy place on track all the while comfortably saying hi and greeting guests as if it were his private party in his home. All of his associates are just so positive and love their jobs. Tim his Assistant Manager made us feel quite to home as well. Everyone did.  What a treat it is to have The Cheesecake Factory in our community and we will surely be regulars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=120,2.58,2.58,2.58,2.58,2.58

We ordered curbside pick up with 2 dinners and 2 pieces of what they're named for: cheesecake. My husband gets home with the food and no cheesecake. He calls the restaurant and tells the girl what happened. She says she'll have to talk to a manager and puts him on hold. After waiting 10 mins, he hangs up and calls back. This time it's a guy, husband tells problem and adds that he was already on hold for 10 mins. Guy says he has to talk to a manager, puts him on hold. After 8 mins, hubby hangs up and calls back. Gets another guy who asks if he's calling about the cheesecake, hubby says yes. Guy says we'll have it ready in a few minutes. Hubby explains we live over 20 mins away, he's not coming back. Guy says he has to talk to manager and, you guessed it, never comes back. Hubby calls again, gets another girl who says we can come and pick up the cheesecake. Hubby says no. Girl doesn't know how to credit us the money. Takes our phone number and says she'll call back. That was 20 mins ago. We have no money and no cheesecake. By now my husband is so angry he's no longer hungry and the food is cold anyway. I realize this place just opened. However, they are part of a huge chain, and as such they should have had their shit together before they ever opened their doors.

The food was good, no complaints on the food. The service wasn't nearly up to par. Our first server forgot a drink at our table after being reminded 3 times throughout 30 minutes. We had another server bring it and then a different server was introduced to our table. Our food took WAY too long to arrive after putting in our order. After asking for our check at 9pm we received it at 10:15. We asked twice for it. I even went up to the front and was told I had to wait for our server. We were finally paid for and out the door at 10:25pm. Until they get their act together, I would suggest not going here unless you have no time restrictions.

One of the things that has to be worked through is flow in a new restaurant. Be prepared for long waits. Now that is out of the way. The food when you get it, is divine. I went for happy hour and I spent the whole time waiting for my food. The cocktails were awesome. The bar area inside is great right now because you can watch all the people that are just waiting to get seated.The restaurant has plenty of seating outside, where you can wait. The inside, near the bar is loud, it's the bar. I ordered off the happy hour menu. I ordered a cosmo, so good I ordered 2. My party also ordered the happy hour burger, warm crab and artichoke dip, buffalo ravioli  and avocado egg rolls. The food was delicious.We also ordered a celebration cake.

My first time at the Cheesecake Factory which I was told was going to be a magical occasion with huge slices of Cheesecake everywhere for the eye to see and the food was in abundance and delicious at that. Yet in the great words of a comedian that makes me laugh ridiculously hard ""oh Nae Nae"" it was anything but. First off the option of the waiting locations are horrendous either inside in a very crowded area which left you asses to elbows or if you were there in the evening in a very cold location outside with very heavy cold metal chairs that have no padding so it was even colder. Finally as we were seated we immediately put in our order in hopes of warming up with some delicious food but that was not the case we waited an hour before the manager approached us and told us there was an issue with the sauce on one of the dishes as the reason we waited so long. Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't you have came out here and told us about this early on instead of allowing us to Stew in our anger about the time it takes to bring out some simple dishes like Curry chicken and pasta. When the curry did come out it was not as advertised it was not spicy at all to top it off my pasta was beyond undercooked hell it was still sticking to itself and standing straight up on its own that's not what fettuccine does. The chicken was fine as a matter of fact I think we all eat off of her plate. I returned mine to the kitchen  only being eating a quarter of the way as I tryed to muscle it down thinking it supposed to be this way but just couldn't handle the idea of continuing with my stomach getting more upset with every bite. Finally the option of dessert was upon us I'm not going to lie I was very excited it's what I heard about every time, the whole reason I came to this establishment. The crunch hazelnut cheesecake was good and that's all say on that. The Saving Grace at the Cheesecake Factory was the gentleman that was attending us he was being very prompt after the initial mishap and continued to check on us in hopes of making things better we appreciate him we left him a very nice tip and a message telling him he was great because he was. We summed up the experience to the company being new and still working out the Kinks although it doesn't change the fact that we had a bad experience it will not deter us from coming back in the future to see if they can make good on the stories I've been told about the Cheesecake Factory being a wonderful place.

So it had to be remade and was given the choice to feed the others in the party or we wait for my food to be finished.

The noodles were almost crunchy. Way undercoo ked! 4th... seated at the window booth of the mall entrance is not a great place to sit. All the passersby looking in at you while you eat.

My third visit I decided to avoid the long delay to get my food and ordered to go. They put me on hold to transfer me to the bar. Of course I was disconnected. They said to pick up in 15 minutes but after my previous experiences, I waited 25 before picking up. It still wasn't ready. On the upside, the food was good and our waiters were polite. I just don't like to wait an excessive amount of time for everything from ordering, food delivery, the bill and the return of a credit card.

62,Carol C.,"San Diego, CA",0,65,,1.0,2017-11-27,"The Cheesecake Factory is normally my favorite restaurant so I was excited when this location opened a mile away from my BFs house .  I can not stress enough that this was THE absolute WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Started with a $12 mai tai that was literally ALL ice .  I sipped about 2 oz of drink , MAX ,and the rest of the glass was just jammed with ice .  Ridiculous .  I should have sent it back but our waitress was too busy talking (f o r e v e r)  to a table of guys to even bother asking us if everything was ok . I also had to ask for bread like five times . And water.  I ordered a BBQ ranch chicken salad , which is normally huge at every other CF I have been to , all over the country .  Here , it was it only tiny with NO dressing , it had NO CHICKEN in it . Huh ????   I had already flagged down a bus boy to ask for salad dressing (waited 20 min for that ) before I noticed there was no chicken & by that time my BF and I were so disgusted& tired of waiting for EVERYTHING we just wanted to leave ,not wait another half hour for missing chicken.  BF got a (lousy) burger & cold fries .   On the way out we passed a newly opened Islands restaurant and wished we went there instead. It will be a long time before I return to this location . Hopefully they step up their game in the meantime . I get they have only been open for a couple weeks but when you go in to a huge chain like this you expect consistent food and (expensive ) drinks and this location fell WAY short . The bartenders , waitresses & cooks need to be MUCH better trained or this location will not survive .   It was a complete waste of time and money and both my BF and I actually left hungry .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=60,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.8920000000000003,2.36
9,Gina G.,"Oceanside, CA",150,96,622.0,4.0,2017-11-27,Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorites for great variety of both main menu items and flavors of cheesecake! I was so excited for this location to open in my backyard. I love that they have outdoor patio seating and seating that opens towards the mall. We sat at the seating that faces the mall walkway and enjoyed the openness and casual atmosphere. Our server was very prompt and knowledgeable of the menu items. I had a delicious almond crusted salmon salad and I would order it again! My parents and husband had pasta and all were impressed. They also have a brunch menu on Saturday and Sundays that starts at 10am. The portions are large and the complimentary bread is a nice touch.

55,Vanessa C.,"Oceanside, CA",14,11,,1.0,2017-11-30,"They don't take reservations...even though the site says they do. Since it's newly opened there will probably be a wait no matter what night you go, that I understand. What I don't understand is having staff and managers that all seem to have no idea what they are doing. We waited 50 minutes (checked in 3 times to make sure we hadn't been forgotten) for first available table, let them know we were ok with outside. During that 50minute wait we watched the patio go completely in seated, 7 total empty tables (more by the time we were seated). When I mentioned it to the hostess she let me know that their system for updating which tables were available wasn't working. She also let me know she couldn't leave the front so she had no idea which tables were open. I mentioned that the manager that had been up front earlier had just been outside and why had she not let them know and gotten some people seated, a shrug was all I got in response. We were then seated inside, which was still pretty packed, and a server got our drinks (wrong the first time, but fixed quickly). We were them notified that the gal that got our drinks was sick and had to go home...probably not the best thing to tell to the people she just served consumables to. Dinner service was slow, don't think that was the waiters fault...like I said...the section we were in was pretty slammed (while the patio was still pretty empty). Food was fine, my husband asked for no tomatoes in his pasta, that didn't happen. He didn't want to send it back at that point because we weren't sure how long that would take, instead he just picked them out. All in all just horribly miss managed and seemingly understaffed. If you have 3 hours to spare and aren't very hungry to start out with (because it will be a while till you actually are eating anything) then maybe give it a try, otherwise maybe stick with the Escondido location...it's farther but at this point you'd probably still be fed sooner! **the response from Cheesecake Factory below is the standard one you are going to receive from them...I don't need to go the extra mile to go through your website to address my ""concerns"". I'm not concerned, I'm upset that we wasted our time and money.

57,June S.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,8.0,1.0,2017-12-01,"Stepping into the Cheesecake Factory in Carlsbad is like entering an alternative reality experience of a bumbling mass of stupidity and inefficiency.  I have frequented the chain in Henderson NV - where the food and service and take out have always been wonderful.   CF Carlsbad is the polar opposite & was not ready to open. It was crowded and as you entered you had to give the hostess your name in exchange for a buzzer.  The hostesses hang around inside a circular booth area.  So do all the people who have already gotten their buzzers because they have no place to sit.  The hostess says, ""come over here, I need your name"". But there is no way to walk over to her because of all the people waiting and leaning on her counter.  Finally, we receive a buzzer.  We opt to wait outside.  We notice the outdoor patio area is full of available tables.  We went back inside and asked the hostess if we couldn't be seated outside.  She replied that twe have to wait because hey have to ""stagger the chef"" &  every ten minutes they seat people.   Then our buzzer rings.  Along with three other buzzers.  There are now four sets of people whose buzzers all rang at the same time.  And inside this circular booth - there are two hostess and a seater girl standing around. Now they are too confused as what to do, because all four buzzers went off at once, so the lead girl gathers & collates stacks of menus.  She hands 4 pieces of paper to the seater girl.  The other hostess says, "" Move over here, get in line!"". We were sort of shocked at the commands.  Then the seater girl doesn't know what to do - so the menu hostess shoved a couple menus at her and the girl says "" Who are you? What's your name?"" Then she reads & picks up one of the four pieces of paper and takes us outside to a really nice patio area where the heat lamps ( we went for dinner) are physically touching this two seater table and places us in the table adjacent to the one that is uninhabitable because of the heat. Our table is wobbly, the legs were never adjusted to stabilize it. We ask the waiter to change tables.  He points to the next table with the heat lamp and asks us if we want to sit there.  We told him we couldn't because the lamp is on the chair.  He says, ""Oh. Yeah. Yes.  It is"".  He offers another table and tests it first and notices that one wobbles too.  We asked to be seated inside.  He says he has to ask the hostess if it is ok.  We wait for him to come back eventually, and he then escorts us inside. Our new waiter, Gus, was a delight and on the ball.  Drinks and hot bread came right away.  We order an appetizer salad and dinner.  Gus comes over and tells us it is his dinner time - he now gets to leave & have a break so he can eat, and he introduces us to his filler waitress, Justine. She's terrific, friendly, and experienced. The people next to us who came in after us get served. Hot appetizers.  Justine comes over again and asks us if we wanted our salads first.  We said yes, and since it was an appetizer salad we assumed it would come out before the meal.  She asked if we asked Gus to bring it out first.  I replied that I didn't think I had to  - she said she would check on the salads. She did stop by a few times to tell us it wasn't ready yet and she was sorry. Its about an hour into the ordeal.  In the meantime, while we are waiting, there are waiters and waitresses waltzing around the restaurant carrying peoples' dinner orders, trying to find where to bring them, asking the different tables if they ordered this and that.  The staff had no idea whose table ordered what food.  When I told one of the girls that the food she brought over was not my order, she asked me,"" Why did they tell me to bring it here then?"". Finally, I get my salad and dinner from another waiter .  My husband does not get his food.  We wait. Then yet another waiter comes by and asks if my husband ordered Salmon and a Salad and he says,""Yes. "" The table is so small, and the plates so big ( no room for the salad plate and the very large dinner plate) that the waiter is struggling because he has no place on which to put everything down. Justine to the rescue clears the bread basket & bread plates off the table.  And the food was ice cold.  It must have travelled all around the restaurant or have been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be picked up.  We decide to leave.  We tell the hostess why.  She says she is sorry and Justine comes over and says we should talk to the manager.  By this time my husband is outside and I await the manager. He tells me he is very experienced. He has worked at CF as a manager for a long time.  He is sorry.  He would like us to come back and give CF another chance. That's not going to happen in the near future. It was an experience like no other...There are no systems in place for anything - They are all winging it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=40,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.924,2.2

I have just finished my second meal at your restaurant since you opened and it was a sad experience.  Let me be clear that the food is great and the wait staff are nice. The disconnect is the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get drinks, bread, food, the check, etc. last time, two people in our party of 7 never got their meal until we were ready to leave and we had to ask them to box it because we had to go. We ended up feeding them from all of our plates. The salad didn't come before the meal and we had to cancel our dessert because it didn't ever come until she brought the check. Through all that, we decided to give you another chance and it was the same wait issues. 15 minutes for drinks, 10 more to get our food ordered, felt like forever to actually get our food, missing sauce and she said they were making more for me, never got that at all.

The food was what you'd expect but the service was beyond reproach. We asked to speak to a manager who came by the table and offered a very poor and awkward excuse about the server with absolutely no satisfaction to their customer. A professional restaurant organization offers to rectify and incentivize the customer by offering to comp something (we weren't even offered a slice of cheesecake for our troubles) or a discount for a future return. Our bill for 5 of us was $180 so you'd think they might want to keep a local who would frequent this new location several times a month. But no, nothing except an awkward excuse about the server.

I just finished eating at this restaurant.  I am a loyal customer to the Cheesecake Factory, so when one opened closer to my house I jumped at the chance to go. The line was long, but it is a new restaurant. We waited a while but there were many other people who came after us who were seated before us. When seated I asked what bottle of champagne would be suitable for my father and I and the waited so ""he didn't know."" About 10-20 minutes after we sat down a couple sat next to us. We ordered an appetizer and waited more than 30 minutes for 4 dumplings. We waited for over an hour for our food. The couple next to us ordered and shortly after their food arrived, they ordered one of the same dishes we ordered. The waiter came up and said the food ""was being worked on."" Our food finally came an hour after we ordered it. Me and my mother's food came first and the waiter told my father ""your food will be out in 5 minutes, uh maybe."" I always get the pasta carbonara so I know how it is usually cooked. The dish I received was about 1/4 as big as it usually is and the chicken was extremely dry. My father's portion was extremely small as well. The couple who was sitting next to us, who ordered the same dish, had a bigger portion. I asked the waiter if they had changed the portion sizes, he said no. He brought his manager out and the manager said that they probably gave me the lunch size and that he would only make me pay for the lunch size. I asked the manager why the couple who came after us and ordered the same things as us received their food faster and he said he would look into and get back. We waited for him, he never came back. I wanted cheesecake but feared what mishap would occur if I asked this restaurant to serve me anything besides disrespect. We paid and left disappointed, disgusted, and hungry. I would have rather just lit a $100 bill on fire and I would have been more satisfied than eating here. What a waste! That meal was not worth the time or the money.

Overall, the food was what I come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory. I go with my go-to every single time the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It's breaded Parmesan chicken served with bow tie pasta and a spicy Louisiana Sauce. At this location the pasta was like warm, I'm pretty sure it was sitting out for a while because the sauce was extra dry, almost non existent. I came with a party of six and I had a feeling it would take a while so I ordered an appetizer, the Avocado Egg Rolls. Ye appetizer came out fairly quickly and the sauce and the flavor was muy deliciosio. However, it took almost an hour after the appetizer to get our main dishes and for any restaurant that is unacceptable. At most Cheesecake Factories they give the obligatory, ""Be careful, the plate is hot."" Not so with this place, which again leads me to believe that our food was sitting sad and lonely, waiting for someone to bring our food to the table. Service was great, our waitress was awesome and I really felt bad for her. She was doing her best, I just think they need to rethink the ratio of tables per server. So kudos to our waitress she was a gem! Another note is the traffic in the restaurant. The walkways were so congested by staff and patrons. So quick recap: 1. Our server was a gem. 2. This place needs to rethink the ratio and walkways.  Hopefully, the problems we experienced with the food and congestion was mainly due to the fact that it was opening weekend.

First our appetizer didn't come out until the dinner came out and the lady said because we thought we'd want it together. She hadn't bother to ask. Then the checks took over 45 minutes to get rung out. The worst part is I asked for a refill of water & had to Ask again because she forgot, the whole meal I didn't get a refill & I ran out before we even started eating.

40,R N.,"Long Beach, CA",36,19,7.0,3.0,2017-12-05,This place is still working out some kinks. Service was soooooooo slow........... Calamari was a little soggy and all the breading came off.  We also had the wings - not bad but not worth the cost.   Tried the Chicken Bellagio and that is definitely enough food for 2. Glad that there is a Cheesecake Factory closer  to us now but Yard House opens up soon and they might give this place a run for their money!  Yard house always has amazing food but again this place opens up in a few weeks so we'll see.  Back to this review... it took 20 mins to get our appetizer and we prob should have complained about the soggy calamari but there were like 50 servers running around but no one stopped to help us or check in on us.  A little frustrating but hopefully service is a little better and faster as everyone figures out what they should be doing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=40,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.348,2.28
106,Carole U.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,14,,1.0,2017-12-05,"Before I go into the nightmare that is The Cheescake Factory Carlsbad, I want to preface it by saying I have been a Cheesecake Factory customer for almost 40 years.  My experience was so bad that tonight I did what I only do under extreme circumstances, both good and bad:  I wrote to Corporate.   To you first-time customers:  Do NOT judge all the Cheesecake Factories based on your experience at this one!  Yes, the food is pricey, but usually you get plenty of it and it's high-quality.  This location, as far as I'm concerned, needs to shut down, and the entire staff should be trained, tested, retested and retested some more.  Only after they pass the standard to which The Cheesecake Factory is held, should they reopen.  That will be the only way this place survives, if their current negative reviews continue. Last night I placed an order through Doordash - a Veggie Burger, the Factory Chopped Salad, a side Green Salad and the Famous Factory Meatloaf.  That was my first mistake and they'll be hearing from me, too.  After about a half hour I received an email from Doordash saying the Veggie Burger was ""unavailable"" and they'd removed it from my order and credited my card.  Ooookay.  I called the restaurant directly to see how to add to my order and was told I had to place it through Doordash.  They also said they'd rush it through and make sure it would be delivered with my original order.  Granted, they fell all over themselves apologizing, and they claimed they'd been having trouble with Doordash being able to connect with them, but I wasn't offered a thing for my inconvenience.  Ten or fifteen minutes later, the restaurant called me directly to tell me now the Meatloaf was ""unavailable.""  At this point, it was past time for my order to have been delivered so I just cancelled the whole thing.  They did admit they'd run out of both items...and they were still going to be open for 4 more hours! Today, I took my elderly mom out for the afternoon.  My mom is 91.  She is recovering from hip surgery.  It's hard for her to sit in a restaurant for a long time so it's easier to order food to-go and take it home so she can enjoy her food in comfort.  We were in the neighborhood so we decided to place a to-go order - the same stuff we'd ordered last night, plus 2 slices of cheesecake, knowing we would be set for at least 2 dinners.  We were told it would take 20-25 minutes for our order, which, looking around the not-so-crowded place, seemed like an awfully long time, but we sat down and waited.  It turned out they were very generous with their estimate.  When we arrived we were the only customers at the bakery counter, which is where you place to-go orders.  All of a sudden, at least a dozen people came in at the same time.  They all placed orders to-go.  Then more people came and placed orders.  A couple of parties came and ate in.  One by one all the people waiting for their orders got them and left.  After 40 minutes I asked how much longer it would take.  2 employees looked at me and asked me if I'd checked in.  Checked in?  What does that mean?  I'd been sitting next to the counter for 40 minutes waiting for my order - and they were the ones who took it!  They asked me again if I had checked in and looked like deer in headlights when I told them my name.  By this time it's been an hour, my mother had gotten up and was shuffling her way to the car, and they tell me the order had been sitting waiting for quite awhile, waiting for me to ""chek in.""  Wait, what???  They'd been calling out names for all the other to-go customers so we were waiting for ours to be called.  One of the employees finally went to get the manager, who, like last night, fell all over herself apologizing, but also made excuses about shift change, breaks, and blah, blah, blah.  They did take off the cost of the cheesecake off my $60 bill, but after 2 bad experiences in less than 24 hours and my poor mom having to sit for over an hour, it wasn't enough, as far as I'm concerned.  And after reading all the other negative reviews of the past 2 days, I know I'm not alone.  It will be a long time before I go back to this one, if ever.  It's too bad - I have 2-$50 gift cards for the place and will either give them away or wait until I find a better location.  In the meantime my 1-star review will stand, at least until I hear back from Corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=100,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.18,2.32
53,Meagan H.,"Vista, CA",126,57,22.0,1.0,2017-12-05,So this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory! It all started about a week ago when I attempted to call the restaurant SEVEN times before someone stopped hanging up on me and  picked it up. Finally when I got a hold of someone they weren't even apologetic about hanging up on me. I was trying to see if I could schedule reservation for a work party of 15 people and the person rudely told me that they don't do reservations but that I could call ahead two hours before we wanted to come in to make sure that we got on the waitlist. Well Sunday comes around and one of our coworkers go to the cheesecake factory 2 1/2 hours before we intended to be there. Myself and the rest of the employees showed up at 7 o'clock like we were told to we are immediately told that we probably won't get to seats until 730 8 o'clock. Our buzzer doesn't go off until 820 and the hostess didn't even have our menus ready so we stood there for another five minutes waiting for her to get everything ready we then follow the hostess out to the heated patio where it is completely dead but we were supposedly waiting for one table to clear up so that they can make us a spot but I'm not exaggerating there was probably over 15 tables available. We then sit down where were supposed to they don't even create a table big enough for everybody the sat us two people short. We are then greeted by the waiter literally the first thing he tells us that the kitchen is backed up and that we may not be eating for a while. We attempt to order our drinks they are out of an espresso so one of the girls can't get her drink. We then give our orders for dinner they're out of two of the dishes that our table ordered we didn't get our dinner so almost 945 at night without order dessert they're out of one of the cheesecakes that one of the girls ordered we were compensated in anyway for any of the mistakes or inconvenience that they created. We then tried to pay with a gift card that was provided by our company to have a company dinner it wouldn't work which necessarily isn't their fault. They even screwed up how they brought out the cheesecakes somewhere meant to go Sam were meant to be at the table they then over brought us cheesecake and then when they realized it they took them away. It's really quite unfortunate that it was such a terrible experience because this is such a better location to where I live I absolutely love cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants but I don't think I will ever go to this restaurant again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=40,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.2760000000000002,2.32

All the steps of service were very slow. I ordered the mushroom burger but substantiated a veggie patty and fries. The patty was quite good I think it had quinoa and lentils in it.

My wife is vegetarian and we ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta, with the chicken on the side. The pasta arrived with pieces of chicken mixed in with the pasta.

Party of 2, Wait was long to be seated but that's to be expected, their NEW! their still working out the kincks. We finally did get seated near the bar and our server was April. She came right away   and introduced herself and had a very friendly smile. Ask us what we wanted to drink, and continued to tell us the fish special and the soup. She went straight away and came back super fast! She was quick to take our order and was great about repeating the order ( thank goodness because she miss heard how I wanted my burger cooked) but I'm not going to dock points because she double checked and that's something I appreciated.we ordered americana burger, old fashion burger and a couple of appetizers we did however wait a longggg time for the food to arrive.  BUT this is where it could have gone bad to crazy stupid mad bad! Our server  kept us posted, kept our drinks filled, bread filled and she was extremely intintive to us and her other tables.  She didn't let the stress get to her. She always had a smile on her face when we saw her. When our food did come it was good. Red flags started when I found cabbage on the burger? She came to see how our food was, we asked  her if its suppose to like that, she wasn't sure, so she excused her self to ask. She again came back quickly and explained it a blend of cabbage and lettuce. we are our food and soon we were finished and she brought the menu for dessert. Her explaining some of the cheesecakes sounds delicious! Her favorite she said was , the celebration for her kids. Bottom line is we waited  a very long time but our food was good for a new restaurant and the service was spectacular ,all because of April just taking the time to get to know us a little bit and keeping us updated so we weren't sitting there furious and waiting. You can tell she genuinely cares and puts all her effort. so if your in the area be prepared to wait a bit and ask for April!

Unfortunately it was NOT a good experience.  First of all, I understand that this restaurant just opened and that CF restaurants usually have a long wait time in general but at least provide waiting customers somewhere to sit while they wait! There was no room at the bar and only two tiny benches for people to sit and wait at which were taken. We awkwardly stood around for 45 minutes along with several other parties in the way of the wait staff and passerbys. Being elbowed and asked to move out of the way several times is not a great start to a dining out experience :/. When our buzzer finally went off we were starving and irritated but excited to finally be seated! It was a cold night and we told the host we wanted to be seated inside and would gladly wait for a seat inside to open up. We were lead past an open seat for 2 inside and out to the seating area inside the mall near the escalator. It was freezing out there! The mall's sliding door to the outdoors was left open and it was like dining in a refrigerator! I wanted to complain and ask to be seated inside like we had asked for in the beginning but feared another epic wait time so we stuck it out.  Our waitress was friendly when she finally made it to our table 20 minutes later. Luckily our bread, food and water didn't take quite as long to come out as we were worried it would. The fare was good quality with decent portions but we were so cold we couldn't wait to finish it and leave! Make sure when you ask not to be seated outdoors to also say you don't want to be seated out in the mall seating area. It's just as cold and uncomfortable if not worse because there are no heating lamps.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go which took a long while to get! The waitress kept coming back to apologize and told us the dessert counter was behind due to a large order. Once we finally got our cheesecake we paid and ran to the warmth of our car.  I don't think we will be back anytime soon. It ended up being a 2.5 hour uncomfortable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.152,2.72

Arriving at 4pm on a Sunday it was packed inside. We were told the wait would be 20-30 minutes which it was. Waiting really shouldn't be an issue, there is plenty of seating outside the front doors and around the patio area to wait.  We had a super friendly server and we were all really pleased with her attitude. Warm bread is offered to start, with olive oil and vinegar which was great!  The four of us ordered avocado eggs rolls as an appetiser, they were tasty but they were more room temperature than anything which was a bummer.  It did take a little while for our main meals to come out, mine took the longest- I ordered the sausage and shrimp pasta.  Again, my pasta wasn't hot at all which was as a surprise since I waited so long for it to come out. The others in our party ordered salads and spring rolls, no body raved about their food but it was definitely edible.  After stuffing our faces with the warm bread and eggs rolls, none of us ate much of our main meals but our server happily boxed up our leftovers for us. Having a great server definitely helped the dining experience as it was just very average overall.

Having been to many other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, I was not surprised by the wait so we put our name down and walked the mall for a while.  After an hour, it turns out it wasn't worth the wait. The service was not good and our server made several mistakes which only made the whole experience even worse. My wife ordered the Renee's special (which she's had like 100 times) and asks for chicken salad on a baguette only to get turkey on a Brioche roll TWICE before actually getting the right sandwich. Of course, by this point everyone else is done and are now sitting and waiting for my wife to eat. No manager ever came by.  So maybe it's just the fact that the place is still new but I would think the managers would get that and be all over the mistakes to make sure you come back. Well, guess what. Won't be back. Heading over to Escondido where they actually care about you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=60,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.056,2.76

Since we went at 3pm on a Wednesday it did not take long for us to be seated and get our food. We started out with the avocado egg rolls which were tasty. My dad enjoyed his Thai lettuce wraps, and I enjoyed my vegan cobb salad, but my sister's Evelyn's pasta was very plain and just ok. Definitely something we could have made better at home for 1/4 of the price. We told the waiter that it was my dad's birthday and ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go...but they didn't do anything special for him for his birthday. No free dessert or happy birthday or anything. That kinda bummed me out because my sister and I put in a huge effort to make this day very special for our dad, but there was no effort on the Cheesecake Factory's part. But my dad is a good sport and he didn't seem to care all that much.

Came up to us and told my brother ""STOP Leaning in MY chairs "" she then started to tell us we will receive no discount and began LITERALLY laughing at our request of some sort of compensation for the error, which we would've been fine without if she didn't start laughing , and my brother was beginning to look worried and sad. Keep in mind we came here for his birthday. The COLD food was decent , and the FEMALE manager kept laughing and pointing at us with other workers. She is extremely unprofessional , impolite and a terrible manager. Will never be back here unfortunately this place is so close  to home. Our combined bill was over hundreds of dollars. Not a problem but after finally walking out at (11:00pm) the same FEMALE manager was still laughing about It and mocking us completely.

Upon receiving these plates we questioned the waitress if these are what we ordered and she said yes. So we start to eat. 5 min later a different food server comes with the dynamite shrimp and miso salmon, which looked alot more like what we ordered. Maybe the waitress is new and is not familiar with the menu items?? Cocktails were also wrong had to send back. They did not even offer an apology for all their mistakes.

It was my birthday and I had a party of 25. I expected a good wait time which they quoted me 2 hours after I had stood at the counter for 20 minutes waiting to be quoted by a manager. We checked with the restaurant periodically as our quoted wait max time approached however we kept being told they were waiting for 1 more table. 3 HOURS later, we were finally seated and ordered drinks and apps. The apps came out Farley quickly but had to wait another 25 minutes for  glasses of water and other beverages. When we got our drinks we placed our food orders with our 2 waiters. And had to wait now another hour for our food. Due to the poor communication between the waiters, food came out wrong, not at all what we asked for, and COLD! We were irritated but didn't want to have to wait again for them to remake it so we sucked it up. After our meals we of course wanted cheesecake. Some orders were taken right away and others had to wait yet another 20 minutes for anyone to come back to our table. 15 minutes from then we got our dessert. You can't mess up cheesecake so that was the only positive meal of our visit. As we finished up we requested checks and explained how we were splitting them. It took another hour for them to get our checks together and even then they were double charging people, adding things from other bills to the wrong persons tabs. Again, poor communication and lack of attention. After having to stand at the register bugging them for our cards and change back so we could leave, we finally got everything and practically ran outta there.

The service was not good at all; the waiter made a feeble attempt to seem attentive and friendly but was otherwise preoccupied with joking around and making fun of patrons with his fellow servers.  Then, came the orders... one of the orders had specific dietary restrictions due to allergies, none were followed and when we identified the problem, the server acted like we were wrong for having restrictions and continually rolled his eyes b fire sending the dish back for the correct order. Additionally, another order was ordered mild and wow, was it spicy; Yet again, it was our fault they messed the order up.  It was my daughters birthday as well and we requested a simple birthday ice cream cup with a song, they delivered it to the wrong table and sang for a couple who informed them it wasn't theirs.  The serving staff said ""we happy unbirthday to you"" and mumbles ""you ungrateful **bleep**!""  What professionalism.  My daughter got a cup after another member of our table reminded the server. The coup de grâce was when the server told me they would comp the messed up meal but then informs me that it was billed again because someone has to pay for it and he doesn't want it to come out of his pay.  SERIOUSLY! I have to cover your mistake, no accountability at all! This is what this location has to offer... subpar service, food that is a gamble because you never know if you'll get what you order and if you have dietary restrictions, watch out because you're a big inconvenience to this establishment since the manager blatantly supports his incompetent staff.  I do not recommend this place to anyone... better to eat at Panera or Islands on the other side of the mall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad?start=120,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.7640000000000002,2.32

I came in with a large party of just over 20 people, so of course I expected the whole thing to take a really long time, but it was worse than I thought possible. After waiting an hour for some tables (because of a reservation mistake) we sat down. One waiter took drink orders of one row of the party, and 10 minutes later a different waiter came to take the drink orders of of the other row of the party. The two people at the end of the tables didn't get their waters until 30 minutes after the rest of the table, after asking 3 times. Then, they sent the appetizer order in literally 3 times and brought out like 20 plates of food and we only touched about 10, leaving 10 plates completely wasted. The entrees came out quick and everyone was done eating in about an hour. AND THEN... wait for it... IT TOOK THEM 2 AND A HALF HOURS, that's right HOURS, TO BRING CHECKS OUT. They brought out 2 checks right away, then a couple more after 45 minutes, then the rest except for 2 another 45 minutes later. Every single check they brought out was wrong. Mixed up orders after they triple checked what items were on what tab. Then after the 2 1/2 hours those final people finally got their checks, Myself being one of them. BUT the only reason we even got our check was because we went up to the register and it turned out they hadn't even started processing our check yet. Thank God we demanded they process it or who knows how much longer we would have had to wait. Plus they had been in possession of our debit card for about an hour. We were the only people in the restaurant because they had closed while we were waiting for our checks that, might I remind you, took 2 1/2 hours to come out after the hour or so from when everyone was done eating.

Mark, the general manager, made me feel so dumb and told me he has worked there for 18 years and that is what their angel hair pasta looks like even though Holly thought that the pasta did not look like angel hair. He even went so far as to bring the pasta before it was cooked to show the difference between the pastas which was plain condescending and a way to rub It in my face tp show that I was wrong. The chefs re made a fresh batch of angel hair pasta and put It to go with my meal because my company had been finished eating for over 30 minutes and I was tired of waiting. This time my pasta was actually angel hair pasta and there was a clear difference. Mark did not even care to come check to see if there was a difference.

When we got our food which seemed like an hour, he didn't come by when we were eating to see if we need refills or if the food was okay.

I've come in here a few times now and every time there has been some type of issue with our order and I've also noticed other people complaining about similar things. What really put that last visit over the top was how rude and unprofessional the female manager was the other night to my mother. My mom had ordered a pretty standard dish for dinner and when we all received our food, my mom had not. After a few more minutes she kindly asked the manager if her food was coming since she had been waiting around 40 min already. This lady, in the most condescending tone I've ever seen, tells my mom ""ACTUALLY, you've been waiting 34 minutes on the dot, and we'll do our best to get it right out to you"". I almost wanted to laugh at how horrible she handled this situation and how absolutely terrible her customer service was. As a manager that's like your number 1 priority to make sure floor is running smoothly and take care of any customers who might have issues like this. How they have that lady in staff as a manager is beyond me, and especially for place that messes up so often I can't imagine how many other people she is demeaning. I hope they figure out their kitchen and staff issues soon because until then I will stay away from this location.  2 stars because the cheesecake still good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-carlsbad,2.2,2.32,2.32,,2.2720000000000002

First, 116 dollars was billed to my account even though the check I signed at the restaurant was for 19 dollars, 27 after an 8 dollar tip. I was absolutely shocked at this egregious mistake and overcharge.  Second, I called the restaurant four different times at different times of the day to discuss this issue and four times I was not put through to a manager. The first two times were at 10 AM and 12 PM respectively. Both of those times, I was told a manager was unavailable.  The third time I called, I was put on hold for FIFTEEN MINUTES and no manager came to the phone. I ended up hanging up and calling again, only to be put on hold for another TWENTY MINUTES.  Finally, after the fifth phone call, I was connected with a manager. I explained the situation to him, and he pulled up my bill. He said that on his end the correct amount was reflected, and when I asked why on my end it said 116 he was not able to give me an answer. All he told me to do was call my bank because it must be their problem. He did absolutely nothing to try to ease the situation or help my frustration. I am even more frustrated now, after the phone call, than I was before.

I checked in around 5:30pm and the wait was 2-3 hours for our group size. Okay cool, we waited. Once it hit 8pm, I walked in and waited for about 20 mins to get an update from the manager because apparently she was the only one that could give me an update for my group size.  Once it hit 8:30, she said it would be another 50 minutes...keeping in mind that my entire party of 30 was there since 7pm. We ended up getting sat around 9-9:15pm and there excuse was that they had a section saved for us but another group of people decided to get up from their booth and sit right in the middle of our ""saved"" section. Well if the section was saved why couldn't they have kindly asked them to move and explain the situation?!  In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for large parties whatsoever. Food was good but if you're thinking of having a nice dinner with your friends and family and it's going to be more than like 5...you're better off going somewhere where they will reserve you a table and have everything organized to make sure your guests have a wonderful dinner and not wait 2-3 hours with them not giving you any updates at all.

Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever seen.   I should have known it would be bad when we got a beeper to tell us when the manager would be able to tell us how long the wait was. Yes, you read that right. The next indicator might have been when they forgot to page us. It took two hours to be seated and get food. The staff spent more time singing happy birthday at two tables than they seemed to have spent serving food all night. My friend ordered his drink and ended up having to go to the bar in order to get it. I suppose it was a well planned way to allow us to stretch our legs since we had been seated for over an hour with no food or waitress coming by. Actually, we never saw our waitress again. Had it not been for Ethan the waiter coming to our aid in a vain attempt to salvage the night, we may have starved to death. A couple members of our party nearly did starve since the chicken and biscuits came with an anemic portion of poultry and what I can only assume was the chef's take on cajun bread since the biscuits were blackened and burned. In an attempt to hasten our food coming out, the kitchen staff didn't bother to actually cook the pasta and just served what could have been peeled off of a child's macaroni portrait. The manager didn't bother to come to check on the complaints or offer any kind of restitution until we asked for her name so it could be included in our call to the corporate office.
