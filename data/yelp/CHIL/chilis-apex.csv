Deanna R.,"Apex, NC",0,6,5,5.0,10/13/2017,My night out with my mom and lil sis was amazing especially Alise our server. She made our experience amazing and fun. She was so sweet. I loved how attentive she was. She did something I had never had a server do before. She actually stood at our table and helped me decide on what to get. She is the best server I have had in a very long time.  The food was amazing and perfectly cooked. The steak was a perfectly cooked medium rare and was extremely tender. The shrimp was grilled to perfection. I was beyond happy with my meal. I tried the blackberry iced tea and I recommend that you order this the next time you go in there. If you are just going for drinks get that and try to see if they can make it as a mixed drink because it is that good.  The facility was spotlessly clean other than the one wet spot on the table. It was easy cleaned up with napkin so no problem. This is probably one of the cleanest restaurants I have been in.  If you are ever looking for a place to hang with friends Chilis is the best place to go and make sure you ask for Alise as your server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Donna C.,"Apex, NC",39,6,,5.0,11/2/2017,Always love coming to this place. Food is great every time we visit. Friendly efficient staff with great food selections.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Julie E.,"Apex, NC",1,7,4,5.0,9/21/2017,The 2 for $22 deal is awesome. Chips and salsa are better than my faveMexican restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Kristen G.,"Cary, NC",4,8,1,1.0,9/10/2016,"Just got take-out from Chili's Apex and am super disappointed. But the service was fast - only took about 30 minutes to have it delivered by 919dine, so I was excited when the doorbell rang! All we needed were a few simple apps - queso & chips, fried pickles, and wings. Simple, right? Apparently not! Incredibly soggy errythang except for the chips (I'm sure they were pre-packaged). Fried pickles were basically not breaded and disgustingly slimy. Wings were soggy and basically drowning in sauce. Queso was actually NOT slimy - it was crusty....?!! Like way too crusty to have been even made today. Now I know to stick to ordering from the Macgregor Draft House or Rudy's - their apps are never soggy when delivered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Heidi J.,"Apex, NC",44,28,16,4.0,1/5/2017,I would give it 5 stars but the hostesses aren't friendly and the food comes out slow. It's always delicious though! Ask for Anthony...he is hands down the best server ever!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Sharan S.,"Cary, NC",0,6,,1.0,7/27/2017,"This might be our first and last (unfortunately) trip to this place. I am writing this right after we came out of the restaurant. So I have fresh memory to share everything what just happened. We live in Apex (yeah locals) and kids wanted to try Tex-Mex for the evening. I am a great fan of tex-mex too. Since it is a weekday the place is less crowded and we got seated really quickly. Then comes our friendly (!!) waiter to take the order. Nothing fancy, we waited for about 5-10 mins, the food came quick. An appetizer , Couple of entrees and kids meals. While waiting for our food, we did glance other tables and found chips+salsa was served for the most. Recently we ate in one of the  Chilis in Virginia and got offered a complementary chips+salsa, so my wife asked about it. Our friendly waiter quickly said, it is not free and you have to pay here. Not a big deal, but he could have been polite. A first indicator of what would unfold for the rest of our time at this place. Buy the way, he forgot to provide napkins and we have to wait and remind him with messy fingers right after the buffalo chicken (appetizer). After that not much interaction with our friendly gentleman. Finally it is time to pay, I have a coupon for appetizer and couple of gift cards and spend. Since the gift cards need scanning, he took everything to the back and applied instead of paying through table kiosk. After everything applied, there was dollar and some change remaining so I handed over my credit card to pay the remaining balance. He took that as well and came and said 'just sign on the table koisk and everything will be fine'. Though it was not a great experience, I wanted to leave some tip and asked how do I pay through the koisk. He said don't worry about it, it's all taken care (????). I felt something fishy but went ahead signed thinking I can check the final bill. The bill came and to my shock I saw the tip amount added without my consent. So I asked politely how did that happened? He said since you paid through gift card it applied automatically (??) When asked to explain, he said you might have selected through kiosk (???). And rudely said if you want I can ask the manager to reverse it and I don't get a tip(???) I was confused, my intentions were clear that I wanted to tip, but felt cheated that the tip got applied without my consent. It could be due to the assumption, (1) I may not leave a tip (2) I look like an outsider (Asian) and may not know US customary on tipping (FYI, I have been living and working in US since 2005, and very well know about tipping system). (3) I know nothing about computerized billing and can be cheated easily (he thought he is super smart). The manager apologized for what happened but did nothing to take care of the forced tipping. For all who wonder how much the tip collected.. for the pretax amount of $47.48 tip collected was $12.28. This is my first unethical experience here in US out of so many pleasant and cheerful experiences :( :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Charlotte R.,"Apex, NC",0,49,,5.0,6/5/2017,"If you've been to a Chili's before, you know what to expect. This location is a good one and I've never had any issues. Service is always friendly, food comes out hot, quick, and tasty, and the place is always clean. It's been consistently good whether I've come at a busy dinner hour or a slow time when few others were there. Some people like to hate on chain restaurants, but sometimes it's nice to go somewhere familiar that isn't going to be such a wildcard as far as quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Gail D.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",13,7,,2.0,12/17/2015,"The food is way too salty for me, I will not go back for that reason. The staff was very courteous. I hate those little kiosk they put on the table, my husband played with it for a minute and we were changed for it. Not even a warning of the impending charge, ridiculous. The two stars are for the staff only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Andrew V.,"Asheville, NC",0,4,,5.0,6/27/2015,My wife and i go here often we always get fast service and great food. Keep it up chilis!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Warren F.,"Apex, NC",0,4,,2.0,8/5/2016,In the past this place has been pretty good.  However they seem to have something going on.  Friday night and the place is empty.  Food was not good.  Chicken was dry and food tasted freezer burnt.  Manager gave discount for the meal but didn't really seemed concerned.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Debra M.,"Apex, NC",0,6,1,1.0,7/16/2015,"You may ask how anyone can mess up a salad since there is nothing to cook (asked for quesadilla explosion salad without the meat) all you have to do is wash the produce, chop the larger ingredients and put in bowl. Sounds simple right? Well the salad I received looked nothing like the one featured in the menu since the lettuce was wilted and brown on the edges and drowning in dressing. The quesadilla was cold and greasy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Frankie B.,"Chapel Hill, NC",35,7,,1.0,4/9/2015,"Went in for a late lunch with my sister. We waited for over 15 mins to be seated before we gave up and left. It was not busy, there was no hostess/host at the front, every Server who walked past us didn't make eye contact with us and didn't stop when I attempted to talk to them. A waitress was having lunch at a table near us and completely ignored us. A man in the back by the bar, wearing a dress shirt with the Chilis logo on it looked at us several times and never came over, even when I attempted to get his attention. It was ridiculous. Every time we have come in in the past the service has varied between sub par to decent anyway but this was just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
S B.,"Cary, NC",0,16,,4.0,10/24/2015,"This location is much better than the new Holly Springs one.  I've been to the Apex one many times and the first time I went to the Holly Springs new location, they undercooked my food to the point that I was concerned to consume it. After expressing concern, the staff was condescending and took an extremely long time to resolve the problem. And I ended up paying the full bill. Needless to say, I will drive the extra few miles and continue to go to Apex!!!  Poor server - it wasn't her fault but it could have been handled better overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Nancy O.,"Cary, NC",4,91,41,3.0,9/1/2014,"Service is quick, food is really just average, but the atmosphere is good. It is a bit frustrating to get nickel and dimed on additional comdiments, especially when the meal you pay for doesn't come with enough!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Terri V.,"Ewa Beach, HI",14,31,,5.0,8/3/2015,We went to lunch here on the way to the airport to drop my husband off to deploy to Afghanistan.  My 7 yr old told the waitress we were taking here dad to the airport to go to Afganistan.  The manager came over and thanked my husband for his service to the military and gave him a free desert of his choice. That was so nice of him.  It meant a lot to our family at that sad time. Keep up the GREAT work.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Jamaal A.,"Apex, NC",6,35,5,5.0,3/4/2014,"Went to red robin. Waited an hour. No burgers. Left and came to chilis instead ... got our burgers in abt 10 mins ... now THAT'S fast service. And they were amazing, not to mention the waitress was human and had a great personality ... unlike the red robin waiter and manager. Red Robin .... pshhht ... whatever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Liz A.,"Apex, NC",0,4,2,5.0,5/1/2015,I have never had a negative experience with any Chili's I've been to.  My girlfriends and I love to start our girls night out having a delicous meal there. The service is excellent and there is such a variety in the food choice it's a great place for everyone with different tastes to go!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
T P.,"Garner, NC",7,24,1,4.0,12/16/2012,"Went to Chili's with a close friend of mines for lunch and to do some catching-up.As soon as we walked in were we able to get a seat with no problem, and the waitress was very friendly.  I wasn't to hungry so I just ordered the enchilada soup with chicken. This was my first time trying this soup and I must say it was very tasteful. To all the cheese lovers this is one creamy cheesy dish and I loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Andrew M.,"Apex, NC",4,11,,2.0,8/29/2014,Our waitress was nice but it took 45 minutes to get our food.  When it finally came it was cold and rather disgusting.  Not eating here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Kelly C.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",82,73,19,4.0,2/19/2012,Chili's is a great place to eat. Lots of variety and the servers are always on point.  I will visit this location again and again. Never fails me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex
Patrick W.,"Apex, NC",0,3,,2.0,4/11/2014,"Ordered Chili's to go - told it would be 20 minutes.  Chili's has 4 ""To Go"" parking spots. All 4 were filled, and not leaving.  Drove around and around looking for a place to park.  Finally park - food was waiting - I mentioned the Parking to the To Go Cashier - he said - ""They're in the bar waiting"" - I said, all Four?  He kind of shrugged me off.  Another To Go patron came in with the same issue - no response.  Food was long ready and cold because of the additional wait caused by trying to find a place to park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex?start=20
Santino L.,"Apex, NC",69,11,41,2.0,12/4/2010,"Well, this Chili's is not nearly as good as the others.  Not a very consistent restaurant, seems to change staff frequently.  My family and I had a poor experience there, and spoke with the manager, and they apologized, and said they would send us vouchers in the mail, and that never happened, and that was 2 months ago.  We tried it again, and the food and service is mediocre at best....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex?start=20
Adrian T.,"Raleigh, NC",5,10,9,4.0,12/14/2010,"Although I can't vouch for the experiences of others, I must say that I was very satisfied with this location, both with the food (extra-spicy Cajun Shrimp Penne Alfredo) and the wait staff. I recommend asking for Tomesia; her service was worth the 25% tip that my wife and I left for her!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex?start=20
Kelsie C.,"Cary, NC",0,2,,2.0,4/27/2011,"My family has enjoyed dinner at Chili's at many locations in the past, but our dinner last night at the Apex, NC restaurant was just ""okay"". The Spinach/Artichoke dip appetizer was great and my son enjoyed the cheesy fries appetizer. My wife and daughter both enjoyed a grilled chicken and black bean entree (forgot what it was called). I ordered the Triple Dipper with burger bites, southwest egg rolls, and chicken strips and my son ordered the chicken strip dinner.  The egg rolls were good (as usual), however the burger bites were dry and tough and the chicken strips were hard, dry, and stringy.  Neither my son nor I ate more than a bite of the chicken strips. The service time was acceptable and the server was friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apex?start=20
