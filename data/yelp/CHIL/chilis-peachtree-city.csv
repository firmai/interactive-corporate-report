Jay R.,"Fayetteville, GA",40,1,,2.0,10/9/2017,"After hearing about my server having worked 2double shifts and then having open on Monday, we thought ok we aren't the complaining type, sorry.  And oh she's stressed because she has to serve the manager.  Hope she got that order right.. two out of three orders were right. Mine was not. Ordered the chicken enchiladas. Received the chicken fajitas.  When it was brought, she didn't care just said no that's what I ordered.  What????  Honestly, just didn't feel up to the hassle. I'm on vacation and just wanted a nice lunch out. .But seriously, as someone in the service industry, she needs an attitude adjustment or another career. Another customer would have pitched a fit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Veorncia B.,"Newnan, GA",14,12,5,1.0,12/3/2017,"Appetizers took well over 20 minutes. Our food took 40 and honestly, the steak fajitas were chewy and just gross. Skip this place and head over to Taco Mac where your food will be worth the price.  I sure wish I had. Awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Karen R.,"Peachtree City, GA",454,351,574,5.0,6/19/2016,"3rd times the charm it seems.  Not too busy on father's day...guess because chili's isn't ""new"" and los to have poor management in the past.  Manager stopped by  to see how we liked our dnner.  We chose two of light fares. Mango Chili chicken and margarita chicken and got the two for $20 dinner combo. Guacamole and salsa. & chips for the appetizer. All really good. Great service too! Happy hour on beer & wine!  Going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Tim M.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,6,,1.0,7/16/2017,Poor service and the food took forever. They work in teams of three and it still sucked. We had to request our food and it still wasn't ready. The chips were greasy and poor quality. Poor training of management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Chris G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,12,1,1.0,6/20/2017,"Been coming for a while - it used to be good. Lately each time it has gotten worse. Not sure what has happened here, but we came for lunch over the weekend. Waited for 10 mins to be greeted by a server. Ordered. Had to ask for our drinks. 36 mins later our food came and two out of three entrees had been sitting so long that they were all ice cold. The server offered to bring us others, but after waiting that long? No thanks! My daughter wanted dessert. We ordered it. 10 mins later the server asks if we would like dessert. Ummm yes, the one we ordered from YOU! Everyone has off days and we are very patient people, but this is our third strike out at this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Michael W.,"Fayetteville, GA",51,10,,5.0,3/12/2017,Took my family to dinner last night (3-11-17) for my daughter and mom's birthday.  Food was great and service was TOP-NOTCH!!!  Bree treated us like we were family.  We will definitely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Ana B.,"Greeneville, TN",1,33,37,5.0,7/14/2016,"Definitely a fan of this location. It has great food, great service, and short wait times. I have ate here twice and i was satisfied both times with their delicious margarita chicken platter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Kevin M.,"Sharpsburg, GA",0,16,9,3.0,12/17/2016,Most of the food is good here. We come often. Today I got the quesadilla explosion salad and the chicken was cold and rubbery. The chicken here is usually bad here. DONT ORDER ANYTHING CHICKEN.  The queso dip and salsa was great. Salads good. Classic nachos are pretty good too. Great place to eat if you avoid the chicken!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Stephen B.,"Brooks, GA",0,18,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Second visit in a month, both times horrible. Wanted to give them another chance.  Table was nasty/ poorly wiped down. Server was not busy, but not attentive. Got same order wrong TWICE.  One meal served on a food-crusted plate. Sent it away, lost my appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Spurgeon G.,"Peachtree City, GA",77,4,15,5.0,8/24/2015,Yes I have been here before and the food is always great and the servers are wonderful people.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Chloe B.,"Tyrone, GA",140,31,7,5.0,6/4/2016,"This is a really good chili's in my opinion. I've dined in here many times but I ordered to-go for the first time tonight. My food was hot and ready in the time they said it would be ready. I've ordered to-go from the neighboring Taco Mac many times, which is a few hundred feet from Chili's, and every time my food is either cold or the portions are tiny so I was skeptical that it would be the same at Chili's. I would gladly order take out again. Customer service was speedy and the bartender, who handles all take-out orders, was very polite. I have no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
J W.,"Newnan, GA",0,203,13,5.0,3/19/2016,Excellent food with friendly and efficient wait staff and front desk. Had the carnitas burrito and chicken enchiladas both with green salsa. Excellent!  We will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
T H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,14,,1.0,5/25/2016,"We ate here for lunch and ordered one of their lunch menu specials chicken quesadillas which were ok only with the lunch portion the give you 17 French fries and the dipping sauce was watered down I hate it when the manager goes super cheap with everything what a rip off, all to save a penny here or there but in the end going out of business since we've stopped going there, we're hoping with so many people leaving LA and coming to the new Hollywood Georgia we can get some good places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Chris C.,"Tyrone, GA",0,19,23,5.0,6/15/2016,"Great day, $5 Presidential Margiritas, that's such a great price. Great quality, Spinach Queso dip is great and of course ice cold Stella Atrois",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Paul C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,3,2.0,5/6/2016,"Good good but very slow service. When we arrived the place was only half full. As the evening wore on and patrons filled in, the service went from slow to really slow. Had a mini dessert included in the meal but gave up waiting for it and paid and left. It's a shame because the food has really improved but the service was so slow it overshadowed the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Amy N.,"Peachtree City, GA",28,4,1,4.0,11/16/2015,"Got it to go. Everything was really good,  just wish they would bring it out to the car like other restaurants do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Charles C.,"Newnan, GA",1,25,,1.0,8/4/2015,"We ate there Sunday August 2. The food was just average,the service (pardon my language) sucked. The menu has been changed and some of my favorite menu items were gone waitress said what I ask for had been deleted in the past few months. I am from Newnan and always liked Chillis ours went out of business but just before it went out we experienced poor service and average food was what you got. I decide to give Chillis a try again never again for me. I spoke to my daughter and she said their Chillis in Rome was going the same way. If Chillis management reads these wake up before you go by the way side. The only reason I gave one star is because lowest score possible for this location. Sorry to rant but was so disappointed with this meal. Oh yes so greasy I had heartburn like Loius Grizzard said ""chilli dogs bark at night "".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Linda F.,"Fayetteville, GA",33,149,20,2.0,3/19/2015,"Not a great experience tonight. Slow to wait on from the beginning even though when we arrived it was made clear that we only had a little over an hour to dine. Waitress kept disappearing took about 20 min to place order and then 55minutes from arrival to get food ? Half our party had less than 15minutes to eat and had to run. Food was ok, just took too long. Took another 25 minute to get go boxes and go drink since no refill? If you have a couple hours to blow and don't mind uncomfortable seating then this is the place as our food was enjoyed swiftly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Jack S.,"Albany, GA",99,16,3,3.0,7/26/2015,"Girlfriend and myself went here for lunch. We got here around 1100 in the morning. The service was average, and the food was average like all other chilies. There weren't many people in the restaurant but it still took us forever to get our food. Experience was the same you would get at any other chilis. Go to taco Mac if you have the choice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city
Cathy H.,"Suwanee, GA",2,5,2,4.0,3/2/2015,"Enjoyable time with friendly attentive staff, clean and inviting environment and good tasting food. I had the dinner for two $35 deal and so much food--We loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20

Mary Ann M.,"Peachtree City, GA",6,72,18,2.0,4/17/2014,"I haven't been in a chili in a yr and decided why not try out the PTC location . It is hard to find bad service at any restaurant in the area . People are just nice in PTC. But it was HORRIBLE. The food , the service , the bar was sooooo slow. Will not be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
Nancy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,80,5,2.0,3/4/2014,"Lousy. Yes, the waitress was in training but she goofed up 2 of 3 orders. The steaks weren't cooked right. It took a long time to get them back. The salad had the wrong dressing. The service was generally slow. Lastly, they didn't even take anything of the bill or give us anything for the problems.  Don't bother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
Gee L.,"Odenton, MD",2,30,5,1.0,2/1/2015,"My date and I had lunch on Sunday and the food has really gone down hill. My date ordered the boneless chicken wings and the fajitas, the boneless wings arrived with barely enough sauce to cover them making them taste like just like plain chicken breast. The fajitas contained about 5 slices of both chicken and beef with about 8oz of vegitables. I ordered the nachos with grilled steak. The nachos I received contained beef that had a consistency of Steakums which is nothing like the grilled steak the restaurant used to serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
Sc M.,"Newnan, GA",0,95,64,3.0,4/8/2015,"Had lunch. Food was good. Staff was friendly.  All in all, a decent experience. Nothing special and no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
Verna A.,"Alpharetta, GA",20,135,11,1.0,10/20/2009,"Disclaimer - this is a review of this particular location - not on the food (which was average, like all other locations). I can't say that service totally sucks, b/c I've had some good experiences. Unfortunately the good outweighs the bad - and the last straw was when we found hair in our food and the manager came out and said ""wow, that's 3 days in a row"". Okay buddy, if you've got complaints of not food particles in the dishes, talk to your staff and do something about it. And don't tell me that this is the 3rd one in a row. Does NOT make me want to come back. And I haven't been since. That just does not sit easy with me.  On the other hand - they did give us a crap load of coupons for molton cakes, which i happily redeemed at another Chili's location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
Nick A.,"Pearl City, HI",32,63,13,3.0,11/18/2009,"Ok so it's a Chili's. They food is decent and it's a place to go it you have a big group and not everyone can decide what they want to eat since they have a bit of everything. I love their chips and salsa though. I can't remember a time I have gone and not order them. This particular location is nice enough. I never see them too busy so the staff is always attentive and polite. And they always get the food out fairly quick. A good place to go for a ""sit down"" place that isn't that harsh on your wallet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
Allison H.,"Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany",43,123,2,2.0,5/29/2010,"I met some friends here for lunch a few days ago and was pretty disappointed. The food was fine but the service was definitely lacking. it was around 1:30 on a Tuesday, so they weren't slammed, but the service was slow and unresponsive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
A. R.,"Peachtree City, GA",1,15,1,3.0,12/22/2009,"No problems here..received the level of food and service we expected.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly.  The food came out quickly and was pretty good.  Nothing exceeded our expectations, but it is exactly what we were looking for:  a few drinks and appetizers.  Will visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
Brittany B.,"Jonesboro, GA",0,14,,4.0,5/6/2013,"have been here a few times. had never even eaten at a chilli's until a friend took me one time. anyways, this one is clean. staff are always really nice and attentive and quick to answer any questions or help u make decisions. food is pretty good. im a big fan of appetizers and they have some good ones",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
George J.,"Newnan, GA",36,50,,3.0,4/23/2009,"Not bad, good selection of food, good bartender - Chris, he's very attentive if you sit by the bar, manager checks on diners on a regular basis and is also very attentive to your dining needs or problems",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20
