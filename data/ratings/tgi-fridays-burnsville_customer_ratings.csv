I have my favorites on the menu so I tend to stick to my regular choices and they are always concisely made the same every time I order.  I like TGI's because they have good specials all the time and I don't think I have ever come without a coupon.

9,Taylor H.,"Savage, MN",21,10,,2.0,2012-07-20,"Disappointed here last Monday night.  Horribly slow kitchen service and grossly inaccurate bill ( more than $20 over) are the first things that come to mind.  At least the manager took care of my wife's entree...loaded down with overcooked steak and sriracha.  Hadn't been to a TGIFs in a long time, might be a long time before we go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024
2,Samuel W.,"St Paul, MN",155,147,228.0,1.0,2013-05-01,"I know. It's Friday's. It's a huge shitty chain that's interchangeable with about five other restaurants. That being said, I went into the ordeal wholeheartedly anticipating mediocrity; instead, I learned that there's no way you can guarantee a decoupaged turd is thoroughly cooked. More on that important life lesson later. I do a weekend job with people that have disabilities. There's one guy in particular that has Down's Syndrome. He has to participate in regular huge spend downs (he has a legitimate job--for now--that brings in an assload of money and the government will cut off his already minimal funding if his account gets too high... this will be a real problem if he's forced into early retirement which happens regularly) so I'm often taking him out shopping. He loves places like this and mentioned that he was in the mood for Applebee's. Being that this place is the same damn thing, I took him here because we were close. Damn me. Damn my decisions. Experiencing less than favorable service when I take him out is not an uncommon thing as sad as that sounds. I think a lot of people see him and assume that he doesn't deserve decency or won't notice poor quality. But he does and so do I. Our waitress came over to us and instantly fell to her knees by the table, crouched awkwardly and asked what we wanted to drink. Apparently, standing was hard because this theme continued. He got a coke and I opted for a cherry lime crush. I won't bore to death with the details, but it took me about twenty minutes to get my drink. During this time, she was busy half-ass bussing the empty tables around us and actively ignoring that we were ready to order. Finally, she came back. We started with the pick three option--green bean fries, boneless rum wings and cheese sticks--and Tom chose the Korean steak tacos. I got a small steak with a couple of blah sides that I can't even recall. She wandered off back to the kitchen. And the waiting commenced.  Tom asked me a couple times if she didn't like us because everyone else seemed to be getting serviced. But, you know, he doesn't notice things like that. Our app came out. I started splitting the portions in half and we both had a cheese stick. It seemed lukewarm but it was edible enough. The green bean fries were all right. I went to take a bite of the chicken and thought something tasted off. It was slathered in sauce so I made a clean cut on another piece to check it out. It was so fucking raw that it was craning its neck to eat the green beans next to it. I instantly chucked all the pieces onto the larger platter and we both proceeded to feel grossed out. The waitress walked by us a couple times, saw me trying to get her attention out of the corner of her eye and suddenly changed her path. I noticed Tom kept looking back and forth between the platter of salmonella and I. He reached over, grabbed a corner of the plate, started wiggling it back and forth and craned his head to emit the most glorious 'Bock bock BOOOCK' noise I've ever heard. I'm not an unreasonable person. I know that it wasn't the fault of the waitress; there's no way she could've known it was raw and she didn't cook it. But when I finally was able to get her to the table her reaction was the biggest ""I don't give a shit"" parade sans the confetti that I've ever seen. *insert uninterested voice* ""Oh... yeah, I guess it's raw. Sorry 'bout that."" They brought out more chicken. The lady that came out flopped it down and also handed out a half-assed 'sorry' before wandering off. It was cooked the second time. I will give them that much. Our entrees slowly made their way to the table. Tom nibbled on his tacos but seemed underwhelmed (which is unusual for him, to say the least). When my steak came with a cattle prod and knife rolled up in a napkin, I knew something was up. It was raw. Not medium rare... not even rare. I had to shock it with the prod to stop it from galloping off. Once again, I had to try and flag down the waitress. Her response was even more lukewarm and she asked if I wanted them to throw it back on the grill/microwave. I declined and asked for the check and a box since Tom was done by the time I got her to the table. It took -forever- to get the bill and even longer for the box.  So much was wrong with the dinner that a 57 dollar bill got knocked down to 17 bucks. At no point did a manager approach me and I never saw one walking around. It was pretty dead in the restaurant (Sunday and 6pm) and by the time the dinner was done, both of us were ready to run as fast as we could in the opposite direction. When we were in the car, Tom made the comment, ""that was shitty and I don't want to go back"". I concur, Tom. I concur.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003
33,Kathleen K.,"Farmington, MN",24,293,5.0,2.0,2013-05-04,"I know better, really I do. But my brother picked the restaurant. His burger came out and while they agreed to cook it medium, it was well-done. I ordered the langostino covered salmon and it was over-cooked with few langostinos. In all fairness our server offered to replace the food but we refused. And the manager came by later to offer s free dessert. Service was excellent. Friday's used to be great about 20 years ago and I am not sure why the food has suffered so much over the past 10 years. They always seem to have great staff - just poor food. The vanilla bean cheesecake was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12
14,Heidi C.,"Burnsville, MN",0,3,,5.0,2013-06-20,"Love this place, we're here probably at least every other week. Food is amazing, service is always great. My usual favorite is the 2 for $15 deal, I love the potstickers but with rice instead of the lettuce and the Korean tacos, so yummy. The other night I had the dragonfire salmon with the vegetable medley and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious as usual but the mashed potatoes were seriously the best potatoes I have ever had in my life, no joke. The cajun chicken pasta is also absolutely delectable, I like to add mushrooms to mine but that's just me. For dessert I'd suggest the whiskey cake. I've only been there late at night so we usually sit at the bar but Cory, Amy and Marcus are our usual favorites.

I do not understand how this place is still open.  We only ordered two appetizers, nothing complicated.  The food was poor quality.  Our plates were dirty and when we asked for new ones,  our waitress said ""oh ok"".  An apology of some sort would have been the proper way to respond for those of us who understand the basic concept of customer service.    The meal ended with less than half of the food being consumed.  To end it all my husband pointed at something above us.  I looked up to see the dirtiest dust lined wall I've ever seen except in a condemned home.  I'm sure some of those dust bunnies ended up on our table. I never complain and I always tip.  I'm so easy to please.  Fridays you must be aiming for mediocre and failing.  Yuck.

I was kicked out from the restaurant by Cassie for just having a cup ice coffee. Cassie took the order, brought the food and then later noticed that I was drinking a Burger King ice mocha coffee.  They don't sell ice mocha coffee here. And I was willing to pay $20 for an ice mocha coffee if there was available here.  She wanted me to give up my ice mocha coffee. Instead, I gave up the meal and continued enjoying my coffee inside my car in the parking lot as she wished. My sister decided to give up the meal also. What the heck of the deal!, it was just a glass of a ice mocha coffee. I argued with my sister not to pay for the order we have not touched any yet. She insisted and fooled me to unlock the car to grab her purse and ran into the restaurant to pay for the food she ordered any way. What a looser Cassie, you took her payment. May I remind you this.  You are working in hospitality industrial. You don't know how much effort and money your management put into the promotion & advertisement to draw in both new and repeat businesses.

Made several calls to the restaurant throughout the next day eventually talking with Jim the manager asking if they had been turned in. Of course they hadn't been and Jim had no intention of asking the servers or the bussers if they had found anything. He was not helpful at all and actually pretty rude. I asked him to take my number and call if they found them. Obviously, haven't heard anything.

The server came immediately to get our drinks, so he said he will come back. Kids had some crayons to draw with and knew what they wanted right away. For me I was torn between Steak and Fish. I decided to go with the Mahi Mahi. Our server was great and he was very prompt. I also decided to get a featured drink.  Kids enjoyed their food. But my food took some time to come and I was little disappointed with blandness and way it was cooked. It came on a plank, but the fish was way overcooked.

I sat at the bar and got great service from the bartender. The floor manager checked on me and was very nice. The drinks were less than adequate (i watched the bartender measure everything to a formula so its clearly a systemic issue, not isolated to his abilities).  The food was uninspired.  i used to look forward to getting late night food at another location, years ago. When i went recently everything was updated,  but incredibly bland and overpriced. They are attempting to do stuff thay  is out  of their league. They need to accept the fact that they do mediocre food and just make the best of it. Dont put less food on a plate and try to make it look worthy of top chef when its bland and lacking basic skill.  Additionally, the bar stinks of old floor mats and bleach (or some other strong cleaner). Not a pleasant odor while trying to eat and drink.  Just to re iterate, I wanna say that the staff is very pleasant and accomodating. This location suffers from the insistence of doing things beyond its skill level.
