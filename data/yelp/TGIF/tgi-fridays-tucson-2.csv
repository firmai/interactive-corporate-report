Lauren K.,"Tucson, AZ",81,338,81,2.0,3/21/2013,"Friday's restaurants as a whole seem to have declined over the last decade.  This Friday's is no stranger to that, and it may have declined worse than other locations.  I'm actually quite shocked it's still opened.  It's completely run down.  The stripes on the tables are rubbed off, and what's left of them are stained on some tables.  The tables also don't sit flat on the ground, so they jiggle or are on a slant all the time.  The rest of the restaurant interior is dark and dingy.  For some reason, they still think the decor style of crap on the walls is still in -- it's not.  It's just old and tired.  The place needs a face lift big time. The food has declined, too.  The portions are smaller, and what you do get just doesn't taste that great.  Some food, like the burgers, are just ok.  The pasta dishes that I once enjoyed are now bad and skimpy.  The appetizers are clearly frozen and heated up.  There's just nothing good about the food besides the fact that you basically know what you're going to get in terms of flavors when you walk into any Friday's. The staff is what brings this review up a star.  They've always been pretty nice and fairly attentive.   If you sign up for their stripes program, they also offer some decent coupons somewhat regularly, which is the only time I ever end up going to Friday's.  No coupon = no go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
John T.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,44,2,1.0,12/23/2012,"This place needs to be visited by a wrecking ball.  We stopped in for a an appetizer and desert and found sticky menus, an absurdly crooked table... I thought to myself, man, this place is kinda run down but let's order.  After the order, went to wash up, and the bathroom was nasty.  Not the kind of nasty that comes from not checking on the restrooms every few hours, but the kind of nasty that comes from years of neglect.  This place is in just disrepair and its sad when places go down hill like this. Now, onto the food.  We ordered a trio of appetizers, the mozzarella sticks were fine, the boneless were ok, but the potato skins were awful.  For desert, we shared a salted caramel cake with ice-cream and it was good.  All said and done with a modest tip, $27. If you like mediocre food, higher prices, and a nasty building (if you read this and you go in, really start looking around and you'll see what I mean) --- this place is for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Melisa R.,"Tucson, AZ",115,132,,1.0,4/26/2013,"Drove past there last night and I'm happy to report this place has closed! When you let basic cleanliness and service decline as this location did, closing is sure to follow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Gina S.,"Cottage Grove, OR",1,30,,1.0,12/19/2010,"Being gluten intolerant for over 20 years I have learned to search for a menu online and/or call ahead and/or contact corporate with any questions about gluten free menu items. In this case I contacted corporate and was assured there were gluten free menu items. Great! So off we go to TGIF. We are seated promptly and I ask for a gluten free menu to which I am met with confusion. The waitress quickly gets the manager who proceeds to tell me they do not have any menu items that are specifically GF, but ""depending of the severity of (my) reaction to gluten there are some items to choose from.""  This guy had no idea what he was talking about and apparently neither did corporate who did not respond to my email describing what happened. Gluten intolerance is not a matter of degree. You have it or you don't, and if you do even a small amount of gluten can severely damage the intestinal tract and lay you up for days. Estimates are that 10% of the population have celiac disease. TGIF needs to understand this and not lead potential customers to believe they have something they do not. Needless to say we did not stay, and I would not recommend TGIF to anyone who is gluten intolerant or suspects they may be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Cesar G.,"Broomfield, CO",1,17,1,2.0,3/25/2013,"It's a chain, so it's like any other Fridays.  The service was slow, at the bar, and there was not that many people there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Elizabeth L.,"Tucson, AZ",3,19,,3.0,8/15/2011,"My husband and I haven't eaten at a TGIF in many yrs and wanted to see if it was as good as we remembered it to be, and unfortunately it really wasn't. It's just an overpriced chain with mediocre service. We arrived right at opening for lunch and it still took over half an hour to get a burger and a sandwich. My husband loved his cheddar bacon burger, which consisted of just as much bacon as hamburger, and my club sandwich was ok, but my ceasar salad was soaking wet in salad dressing and so salty it was inedible. The cost was $30 which I thought was not even close to being worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Zack S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,17,,3.0,3/15/2013,"Had the taps steak skewers...amazing! I could bathe in the sauce! And $3 tall Stella or any kind of beer cant be beat! Stellaaaaaaaaaaa! Sat at the bar, bartender was a tool, and the guy across the bar actually made me uncomfortable, awkwardly sucking on some girls neck and face!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Chris F.,"Vacaville, CA",58,334,6,4.0,6/29/2011,"Maybe I been getting the long straw both times I went there.  Love the trivia.  Peanut butter chocolate pie desert thing is good.  My companion had an LIT which was good.  Beer was good.  Ch. Quesadillas were good just too small of a portion, and the chicken strip what have you appetizers were good as well.  Chris the bartender is solid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Angela A.,"Ely, United Kingdom",16,6,3,4.0,7/14/2011,"Great place for lunch. Right around 11 you can get in and out easily. Good selection,  but they are a franchise so not everything online is on the menu. I have also used the phone ahead takeout service. My food was waiting upon arrival. Great for those short lunch breaks. Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Carol S.,"Tucson, AZ",1,41,,1.0,3/21/2013,"After reading all the other reviews on this page, I guess I lucked out.  I had the ""new"" Korean steak tacos (on flour tortillas rather than on corn tortillas) and they were really, really, excellent.  It was freshly prepared, as was the rice, and the seasonings were great.  However, the facility is a total disaster and desperately needs to be renovated -- the bathrooms were disgusting, the chairs are all falling apart, the tables  don't have four even legs (or maybe the floor is just uneven), the floors needed sweeping, and everything just looked OLD -- as though nothing had been fixed since the store opened 30 or 40 years ago.  See John T's review about the facility--It's right on the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Brittney G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2012,"Probably my worst restaurant experience ever. My husband and our friends came in at about 7:00 on Saturday night. We stood at the front waiting to be seated for a bit. There were servers gathered in the back just staring at us. The could have sat us themselves but they were too busy in the back. We finally got seated and waited at our table for over 15 minutes without a server or even the hostess greeting the table and taking our drink order. The same servers standing and gossiping in the back, were still there just staring at us. After waiting 20 minutes without seeing our server, we got up and left and went else where. If you are only kind of hungry and don't mind waiting a ridiculous amount of time for even a drink, the food is good. But other than that, I won't be returning and I suggest you shouldn't even bother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Mallory M.,"Tucson, AZ",1,10,,3.0,7/11/2010,The late night happy hour here is pretty good but you can only get the happy hour prices in the bar area - not pleasant when you have a bigger group. The food is okay and the drinks are good. There is kareoke during happy hour so there is some funny entertainment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
Surranna V.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",38,210,2,4.0,11/16/2008,"One night we wanted a burger and instead of going to the usual spot we tried something new and wild, we went to Friday's on Friday and it was packed. We sat at the bar and it was really nice and with a better selection of beer than I would have imagined, I was impressed. Nothing to exotic but no budweiser.  They have a $4.00 margarita that was pretty damn good. So 4 stars for the bar and the drinks and 3 stars for the burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson-2
