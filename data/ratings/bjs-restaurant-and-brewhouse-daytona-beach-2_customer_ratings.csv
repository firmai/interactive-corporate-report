We were a group of 10 and sat outside. I have a BJ's next to home, but this is where the group decided to go. If you been to BJ's and like beer, its always gonna be good.

87,Jackie S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",28,325,329.0,1.0,2012-03-16,"The atmosphere of BJ's is incredible, it is very spacious inside, and has a trendy metro-feel to it.  When I asked our server about what she would recommend from the menu and her only suggestion was a mixed greens salad.  I had the Baby Back Pork Ribs entree, with the mixed vegetable and a baked potato. My fiance had the New York strip steak, which arrived overcooked, with a Caesar salad and a baked potato.  My entree arrived ahead of my fiance's and it was cold, the baked potato was undercooked (it was still hard in the center), and the mixed vegetable was mostly broccoli (which is okay, but not what the server said it would be). When my fiance's steak arrived, you could tell immediately that it had been overcooked, he had requested it to be cooked medium-rare, it arrived past the point of well-done. Our server really didn't seem to care that much since she stated, ""I told you to get the salad."" Seriously? You've got to be kidding me.  Overall, the meal and the service are deserving of ZERO stars.

75,Kelly H.,"Orlando, FL",775,346,387.0,1.0,2012-12-05,"I will start off by saying that I like BJ's overall as a restaurant (at least with my experiences in the Orlando area) but this particular BJ's was not up to par. My sister, cousin and I came here for lunch and were told to stand by the wall and we would be seated next.  Next thing we know, two parties who came in after us were being seated first because they forgot about us.  So as soon as we said something the manager made sure we were seated immediately. Once at out table, we were greeted by our waitress, Jessica.  She was very quick with us and didn't give off the best impression.  Once our orders were in, we sat and waited.  We finished our sodas at one point and were not refilled for about 10 minutes, and when she would bring us refills, the cups were not completely filled.  My cousin's beer did not come to the table until 20 minutes later.  My sister's food came out first and she was halfway through eating by the time my cousin and I got our food.  When I received my food, the chicken fettucini alfredo, it was cold.  I asked the waitress for hot alfredo sauce so I could poor it on to warm up my food and she pawned it off to another waitress and had an attitude.  The alfredo sauce never showed up after waiting 15 minutes for it and everyone at my table had finished their meals.  Jessica was very inattentive, rude, pawned everything off to other waiters, didn't apologize for anything and was an overall terrible serve.  She also kept my change assuming it was her tip....which is was not. We spoke to the manager and he was great.  He took my food and my cousin's beer off the bill and gave us all mystery gift cards to use the next time we come in that could be worth anywhere between $5 and $500. The only good experience I had was with the manager.  He at least knows how to make things up to the customers, although he needs to hire better staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.7560000000000002,3.3200000000000003
110,Penny L.,"Daytona Beach, FL",5,31,15.0,2.0,2013-01-18,"Not a place to visit if you only have an hour for lunch break! We were there for 2 hours to eat 4 salads, no apps, no alcohol, no desserts. The service is as slow as molasses. Here's the scoop: We ""called ahead seating"" for 4 guests for 1:30pm, but still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated when we arrived, even though we noticed lots of empty tables while walking to our seats. We all ordered salads for lunch, one guest ordering the ""unlimited"" soup/ salad which would later become his demise.  Good luck trying to get refills on empty drinks, let alone another serving of unlimited soups/ salad.  The salads came out sporadically instead of all together, being spaced about 2 minutes apart each. That's strange and annoying. Waitress had to be asked for refills instead of being proactive.  Overall - the steak salad was nice, but not enough to entice me back to poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=100,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9520000000000004,3.2800000000000002

Better service at the bar.  Wait staff is so slow its depressing:( Waited 30 minutes for a pitcher and two shots of tequila Jose silver. A pitcher of there own beer is 17 freakin dollars!  ?????  Waitress also tried to charge us for Jose Gold tequila on the bill. Had to call over the manager to change it after they made us wait another 15 min after we were clearly done. The Food: The Jalapeño Burger was freaking awesome! Fried jalapeños, pepper jack cream cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomato and lettuce.

There sandwiches are pretty tasty but again nothing amazing. They have some pretty good salads i will say. My favorite thing about all BJs across the country are there beer and appetizers. The both of them are pretty good. I have been to lots of BJs across the country and this place is just like the rest....chain food dinning......so its pretty much always the same.

68,Shannon H.,"North De Land, FL",203,161,481.0,3.0,2013-04-18,"My coworker and I stopped here for lunch today and this was our review The good:  We started out with Chicken wonton appetizers and Mozzarella sticks. The Chicken wontons come in tai or buffalo and you get 3 for about $3.00. We ordered the Tai ones and they were very good. I can tell that will be a dish I'll crave and go out of my way to get. The Mozzarella sticks were the best ones I've had from anywhere. They were crispy and flavorful as well as the cheese was nice and melted on the inside.  For lunch, I ordered half flatbread pizza (Black and Blue style) and my coworker ordered the Chicken Alfredo. My pizza was delicious! It had steak, Portabella mushrooms, red peppers, Mozzarella cheese and Blue cheese. It looked like it would be bland but from my first bite I was blown away by how well the blue cheese topped everything off. I'll definitely recommend it.  For dessert, we had a coupon for a free ""Pizookie"" Its basically a cookie baked in a small pizza pan and topped with ice cream as soon as it comes out. OMG talk about melt in your chair, roll your eyes back, and hold it in your mouth to savor the flavor!!! AMAZING! The Bad: I ordered a sweet tea and I received an unsweet tea, our waiter didn't come check on us, so I had to ask another waitress to get me sweet tea. She was very nice and pleasant but then my tea was pretty much Sugar water. I'm very particular about my sweet tea (Its the south in me) and its an honest mistake and a matter of preference.  We asked the waiter for boxes and he only brought us one box and I had to wait for my box for about 10 minutes because he got too busy taking everyone else's orders. My coworker liked her Chicken alfredo but said Red Lobster is way better. When I asked her what would make her lunch better she said its bland and could use some salt and other seasonings. She wasn't impressed. My pizza came with a side of salad and it didn't hardly have any dressing on it...order extra!  The appetizers were way better than the actual meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.34,3.1200000000000006

I can testify to the clean and neat atmosphere, the great selection of beers, soups, salads, appetizers and their amazing burgers. Another favorite is their Blonde fish & chips made from real cod (and not Swai or Tilapia.) I will admit that the service can be iffy at times but that's usually during their peak service hours so I usually plan to arrive there just before or after those periods.

108,Troy F.,"Orlando, FL",10,5,,1.0,2013-08-18,I'll add more after I leave however I was blown away at the price the waitress told me for a rum and coke. I thought maybe it was a mistake so I went to the bar and asked the bartender what it cost and it was actually $1.50 more than the already outrageous price the waitress told me.  I've been here before and it was awesome but even the food prices are way above what they should cost. Not sure if there was a recent giant increase in prices but $10.50 is ludicrous!

125,Michelle M.,"Orlando, FL",28,6,2.0,5.0,2013-11-16,"My husband had an appointment at Eyeglass World right up the street, so we decided to have dinner close by.  He has been to BJ's with his kids a few times, but we had never gone there together.  What a surprise and delight our experience was at BJ's!  We got to our seats just in time because not more than 10 minutes after we arrived, a huge group came in and the lobby was bustling with people and activity.  Luckily, the place is big enough that it absorbed it all and we were still very comfortable and could hear one another talk.   We ordered our glass of wine and within a few minutes our waiter, Dustin, brought the wine to us and remembered to bring the extra cup filled with ice.  I know it's sacrilege, but I like my white wine ice cold!  I decided on a ribeye with baked potato and veggies, and Mike was getting a pizza.  When I ordered, Dustin suggested the two for $35 menu since the ribeye was already on there and, on it's own, was $19.99 so this was a great deal.  You get a salad or soup, the entrée plus two sides and dessert to share.  Mike decided to get the ribeye as well, mine medium rare and he medium, both of us with a baked potato with butter and sour cream and I chose the winter veggie mix, while Mike chose the green beans. Dustin brought our salads very quickly, both with ranch dressing.  The plates were loaded up with the greens, tomato, cucumber, croutons and the ranch dressing.  Oh my, their ranch dressing is delicious!  We both ate every bite of our salads and sipped on our ice cold Chardonnay.  The restaurant was hopping and their waiting area was filled the entire time we were there, but folks seemed fine with waiting and were seated reasonably quick.   Mike and I both commented that it felt really good that there was no rush with getting us in and out of there, just a nice leisurely meal in a place with great atmosphere.  Their bar area has a huge TV in it's center which was playing four different channels, showing various sports events. Our food arrived fairly quickly and it looked delicious.  Steaming baked potato with luscious looking veggies and a lovely ribeye steak.  As we cut into our steaks, we both noticed that they were very rare, barely even warm center on my medium rare, and Mike's medium was almost more rare than mine.  We let Dustin know, and he immediately scooped up our plates and told us he would get the steaks cooked up a bit more and get them back to us as quickly as possible.  Within a few minutes, the manager came up to our table and apologized for the steaks and let us know they were getting them taken care of in the kitchen.  So polite and apologetic, we were very impressed!  Within about 5 minutes, our plates were returned to us with steaming hot steaks, a new baked potato and steaming veggies.  Both of our steaks were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious!  I don't know what kind of rub or marinade they use, but the taste was as good if not better than Ruth's Chris and Flemings.  Every bite melted in my mouth!  The potato was huge and the butter and sour cream, along with fresh chives was a great accompaniment to the steak.  On top of that, my winter mix of cauliflower, broccoli, fresh carrots and butternut squash was to die for!   As we were sipping our wine, and enjoying our delicious meal, the chef comes to our table and apologizes for the initially undercooked steaks.  We told him that we understood and the steaks they sent back out to our table were delicious and we were extremely happy.  He apologized once again and quietly disappeared as we continued to savor our meal. Dustin then came back to the table and asked if we were ready for dessert.   We had pretty much decided right before then that we were going to skip dessert since we were so full, and already taking home half our steaks and sides to have for lunch tomorrow.  Dustin was like, ""no way, you gotta try this dessert!  You won't regret it! ""  We acquiesced and boy, did we make the right decision!  This stuff was manna from heaven, let me tell you!  A deliciously warm brownie with a soft center (similar to ""dump cake"" or molten lava cake), with peppermint ice cream that melted perfectly along with the bites of not-too-sweet dark chocolate brownie, and the crushed peppermint candies gave the dessert a lovely crunch and so much flavor!  I don't typically eat dessert, and neither does my husband, but we ate EVERY single bite of this dessert. We joked with Dustin that ""we didn't like it at all!"" and he hung out with us for a few minutes and joked about his recent honeymoon in Key West and food and restaurant experiences -- he was just a great guy!  You must ask for him when you go to BJ's!  He was a hoot! Needless to say I am sitting in my sweat pants and baggy shirt and savoring my delicious meal and wonderful experience at BJ's ... Mike said that we should go back soon and I said ""tomorrow?  After all, it will be Funday Sunday""!   . Go soon!  You won't regret it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=120,2.84,2.84,2.84,3.636,2.84

The atmosphere was typical for a sports bar - but not too loud that you couldn't converse, music was fine, lots of tvs to watch, a bit chilly for shorts and a short sleeve shirt.  My husband was very disappointed by their beer menu. They list many specialty beers and seasonals, none of which were available when we stopped. They didn't have the first two beers he tried to order, even though they were on the menu. He ended up with a beer sampler of their year round brews. The IPA was pretty good; rest were mediocre, but he has pretty high standards. We ordered the appetizer sampler and a small deep dish pizza, and it was more than the three of us could eat. The avocado rolls were our favorites. The spinach and artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks were pretty classic. The other rolls on the platter tasted like spicy Taquitos (not in a bad way). We also had the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza, which was very good. We would definitely get it again. The server warmed up to us after she realized our child wasn't a screamer/food thrower.

Our waiter was very friendly and informative about the menu. The beer choices were very robust and the food was good, but not anything special. Negatives: The biggest problem I had with BJ's is the menu size. They have everything from pasta to pizza and burgers to seafood. The menu can seem very overwhelming with nothing that stands out. The server took a while to get to us and take our order. Once the food was brought out to us, we were looking around to figure out how we could start eating. We were never given any utensils until after we asked. Verdict: BJ's seems to fall victim of an identity crisis. A place that is ok in everything and great at nothing.

Very easy to get to from 95, plenty of parking, and there's plenty of seating available, so even if it's busy, it won't take long to get a table. We grabbed a seat at the bar to check out their beer taps and grab some grub. Bartender was great, and service was awesome. I'm always impressed by the selection of draft beers at BJ's, and their house drafts are pretty tasty, although I usually grab a Sam Adams. The menu is pretty impressive, offering a lot of different appetizers and main courses, including a few items you wouldn't expect to see at a place like this. We just ordered a couple of appetizers, and the food came out fairly quickly, it was fresh, and most importantly, very tasty. Every time I've visited a BJ's I've had a very good experience, the service is usually great, and the food has always been good.

Great place to have lunch, dinner, or stop in for some drinks and hang out. Nice atmosphere, good food, great drinks, and great service.

While we did stop in the week prior to the race, it was not even close to packed, so our experience cannot be chalked up to an overwhelming amount of customers.  The root beer glazed ribs appetizer were delish. Sweet and tangy, with just the right amount of heat. Yum! Their flatbread pizza appetizers are normally homeruns, especially the really unique ones (sadly several have been dropped from the menu) but this time we stuck with the tried and true pepperoni extreme. Unfortunately it was extremely blah. Couldn't make out the different cheeses, and the pizza itself wasn't crisp. The crust wasn't raw, it just wasn't thin and crispy.   As for our entrees, another ""meh"" performance. The spaghetti and meatballs were good. The meatballs tasty and well seasoned (love that they include some Italian sausage), the sauce decent. My companion had teh ham turkey club ... what a disappointment. The lettuce was limp, edges were browning (UGH). The tomatoes were tasteless, and the entire sandwich was soggy.

This time the waitress wouldnt refill my float and when I asked why she said that I would be charged for the ice cream. No idea, so I said no but now fuming that she refused me something that I know I was able to have, having had it not 2 weeks prior.

Manners really were her thing, we'll leave it at that. The brussel sprouts were burnt.. like char broiled and bad so we sent them back.

We were given 3 or 4 servers that we barely saw and took an unnecessary amount of time to get drinks. It took us 45 minutes to get our food and we had to go in and recruit another server to get us refills because we never saw our servers after food orders were taken. There was no communication for the untimely manner that food arrived at the table. When we asked to see a manager we were told we couldn't because he was cooking. Well if they were short staffed that should have been said early on... we would then understand the food arriving 45 minutes after ordering.  I'm very upset because this was a big dinner and supposed to be be a happy and pleasant experience for me and my kids.

38,Aisha A.,"Deltona, FL",28,21,8.0,1.0,2016-05-11,"i went to this location on Saturday 5/7 with a group of 12. Let's just say from the minute they seated us things were off to a bad start. First off, they wanted to seat 12 people plus a baby sling at a table for 8. They then open the flaps for the table and add 4 inches making another attempt to seat us there. Mind you this was around 1030PM and there were probably only 4 other tables of guests. Then they gave us a server who was highly incapable of taking orders and bringing our food to the table in a timely manner. She would bring 2 or 3 appetizers out at a time right after the previous set of plates were empty. In this case, we werent really able to eat as a group and some of us ended up waiting for others to get their food to the point where ours was so cold it was inedible. We are very unsure of what her issue was with getting drinks but everytime someone asked she'd either ignore them to where we would have to hunt her down for a refill or take the glass with a pompous attitude and roll her eyes before coming back to slam the glass on the table to show how annoyed she was. She miswrote two of the orders at our table and when approached about it she just looked at us like we were speaking an alien language to her and she did not know what was going on. No apology or anything. Upon bringing the new meals back she had so much attitude dropping it on the table she almost hit the guest in the side of her face with the bowl. At this point I was highly irritated and could not deal with her snobbiness any longer. I requested to speak to a manager. I have never seen someone learn their please and thank you that quickly! The manager came over, comped two meals and that was about it (we didnt care to have anything comped but if you dont like to serve people then just dont do it!) Now comes time for our checks.

I'm giving two stars instead of one because of the BJ'S phone app which allows you to schedule on the wait list via phone and our flatbread pepperoni appetizer which was pretty tasty. Everything else went downhill from there.  First our server took ten minutes to get to our table, slow service and not very busy so I was surprised by that. We ordered and had a pretty decent appetizer but our dinners were another story entirely. My wife and I ordered prime rib sandwiches with fries. They were very small and just meat, nothing else. The fries were buried in salt. Now I like salt. I use it all the time but between the massive amount of salt on the fries, sandwich and au jus it was almost inedible. I actually left food on my plate and this was a small order that cost me $16.  My son ordered a burger which came out prepared incorrectly. My wife and I are done and my son still hasn't eaten. After 15 minutes a new burger comes out burnt and nothing melted on it. We asked for a manager at this point. The manager was apologetic and comped the burger, appetizer and threw in two desserts. I'm glad because those meals, drinks and appetizers which were sandwiches and fries would have cost us 67 bucks not including tip.  Our server, by the way, never refilled our drinks. I had to ask another server to do that. The table next to ours  gave up on getting service and walked out.

7,Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419.0,3.0,2017-06-06,"While I'm not a huge believer in Gordon Ramsey, I do buy into one of his most basic ideas that you see him talk about on TV all the time.  It's really hard to be all things to all people when it comes to a restaurant menu.  Better to do ten things well then do a hundred things half-assed.   Clearly BJ's didn't read that memo because it's a little weird to be given a menu that has page numbers on it due to the sheer size/volume of what your being handed.  This is the War and Piece of restaurant menus.  I don't know how many entree items are on the menu but I read an article online that said the chain cut just their entrees down from 181 to 150 three years ago.  150!  And that's just the entrees!  Holy Crap! So we came in just before nine on a weeknight and overall the restaurant was fairly dead.  Lots of TV's everywhere with everything on them from college baseball to hockey to basketball.  Add in music turned up fairly loud and ripping A/C and this is definitely not a spot that you're going to be having a quiet intimate conversation at. The best part of the meal was the service.  It was solid from front to back.  I chalk part of that up to the restaurant being dead but overall our server was very good.   As for the food: Spinach and Artichoke Dip - Overall fairly flavorless.  Lots of chips while the dip was mostly a greasy/oily/room temperature/flavorless mess. Small Cheese Pizza - This is the ultimate ripoff at over eight dollars.  Four small micro slices.  In the real world you could get a pizza twice the size for the same price. Cherry Chipotle Glazed Samon & Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles - The people who ate both of these were very happy with both the flavor and the large portion size. Shrimp & Asparagus Penne - You would think that these things would work well together but honestly I'm not so sure about that.  The marinara sauce is so strong, acidic and bitter that you can't taste anything else.   The other issue here which needs to be discussed are the prices.  The food is way, way overpriced for what it is.  Like I referenced earlier, over eight dollars for a small four slice pizza with the other entrees being over sixteen dollars a piece.  I guess that would be good if everything were great but it's not.  Some portion sizes are really large while others are very small.  Some things have good flavor while others taste like nothing.  That's a lot of dough for food which is this uneven. Within the last year close to home a BJ's opened up about thirty minutes away.  I haven't been there yet and honestly after seeing what this location is about I'm good with not hurrying over because the menu prices are high for what you get and I honestly think that they would be smart as a chain to cut down maybe half the menu. While not horrible, our experience at BJ's wasn't a great value either.  Three stars all the way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2,3.52,3.51,3.51,,3.5140000000000002

19,Woody W.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,9,,2.0,2017-06-18,"We are big BJ's fans and have enjoyed many a visit - including last year at this very location on this very day - Father's Day. I wish that were true this year, but it's not.  Where to start - we had to wait 15 minutes despite there being ample empty tables - and arriving at about 445 pm (pre-dinner rush). Once seated, we enjoyed reviewing the menu, and again, and again, and again. It took. I less than 10 minutes to get just our drink order taken... not to mention another 10 to get the actual drinks.  We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our meal - because we'd had plenty of menu review time. Strongly recommend the Brussel Sprouts!  Half of our table was served about 5 - 8 minutes before the other half. And, it was the adults served first - a big mistake than anyone who has ever even been near a child knows. But, at long last we all had ""food."" I use quotes because my son's and I who each had burgers enjoyed something more of a charcoal briquette on a bun - well-done ain't got nothin' on these burgers!  We got to listen to the table behind us complain about speed and quality and got to watch the manager do virtually nothing about it - look no further than her for this locations speed and quality issues. Folks will follow a leader and rise to meet their expectations - but this leader wasn't leading.  We had to wait for drink refills (iced tea and water - not exactly complicated) twice during our meal. And, our salad/appetizer dishes were left at the table until we asked for it to be removed well after main dishes arrived. We never did get empty glasses removed from the table - they just kept stacking!  We ordered dessert because their Pizookies are awesome. And we were greeted by our bill before we even got dessert delivered to the table. They made a huge to-do about getting our rewards information before we were seated, but didn't ask to use this before bringing the bill.  We will be back to a BJs, but not this location.  And if you get sat in Lora S's section - grab a newspaper, because you are gonna wait! After we settled-up, I asked to speak with the manager, Vivian. I reviewed the entire contents of this review with her. She acknowledged these were problems and let me know that she ""just needs to give her servers some extra help tonight."" At no point did she offer to make things right or repair the relationship with this customer. As I said before - very poor leadership that results in very poor service and quality.

34,Jan T.,"Deltona, FL",0,15,,5.0,2017-08-06,Our favorite place by Daytona speedway. They have the best management and staff. Menu has something for everyone. Kids love the Pizookies.

22,Sally V.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",0,4,,2.0,2017-08-30,"I will start by saying we come here fairly regularly bc we like the beers.  Very disappointed with the food this visit.  Not only was the food slow. It was wrong all attempts and they never got the meal correct.  And knowing this, no manager ever came out nor was our raw pizza (after 2nd attempt and over 45 mins.. we boxed it up) comped.  Don't expect the food to be what the menu says.  This isn't the first time we had incorrect food here, just the most annoying time bc of how long the food took and no manager came out And the fact I paid for a raw pizza they re-made twice.  Bartenders were good. I felt bad for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2?start=20,3.16,3.44,3.44,,3.3280000000000007
3,Stef B.,"Ormond Beach, FL",51,73,93.0,5.0,2017-09-03,"I came here for dinner one night because I heard great things about this place - I was excited to try since we have none in NY. It was pretty busy for a week day night but my dad and I got seated right away. The inside has lots of seating available. Between my dad and I, we got beverages, two entrees and dessert and it all cost us under $40. I was prepared and had a coupon for a free entree with purchase of 2 beverages. Check out their website before coming here because they will post coupons and specials that they have. The food was better than I imagined. Several vegetarian options - I got the veggie tacos with a grain salad - so delicious and fresh. My dad got a chicken dish which he really enjoyed.  Then of course we had to end the night with a trio of pizookies (that's what everyone comes for). We got the chocolate chip, peanut butter and the monkey bread. Each one is topped with ice cream as well. My dad and I surprisingly liked the monkey bread the best. Overall, great food, excellent service and environment, and fair prices if you come when there are specials. I definitely will be coming back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2,3.16,3.44,3.44,,3.3280000000000007
12,Catherine B.,"Daytona Beach, FL",6,13,,3.0,2017-09-14,I have been here several times for lunch if you go for a early or late lunch its not so bad but peak times or holidays be prepared to wait. the wait staff is friendly but not always great about knowing about the meals or how they are cooked or ingredients important if you have allergies. beer is great. generally the music is way to loud for myself and often I have to talk really loud for my friends to hear me or the wait staff. The food is great and reasonable but some days just not worth a wait in the heat outside. parking is often a issue at peak times. you may have to park a ways from the building,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-daytona-beach-2,3.24,3.42,3.42,,3.3480000000000008

2,Tari T.,"Orange City, FL",11,26,4.0,5.0,2017-10-02,"The decor is as provocative as the menu. Lots to look at and talk about. The hostess greeted us with a smile and the VIP question. Seems if you sign up with the app you can earn points. And with our first time trying and signing up with the app we gots us some freebies! Hubs got the portobello mushroom burger and he was near tears. His burger came with a as-big-as-his-burger mushroom on top, which was grilled to perfection. I got the buffalo bbq burger and it was amazing. Our beers were dark; Porter and Tatonka.  Both amazing. Porter was smooooth. Tatonka was a smidgeon sweet but hoppy. Loved them both.  Our freebie was the Pizookie. Salted Carmel. But the choices were difficult. Monkey Bread Pizookie would be our next pic. But there's something for everyone. OMG amazing!  Taylor our server was the best. We couldn't make up our mind about the dozen choices in beer and she let us test a little shot of them. She was friendly and helpful and just a joy to chat up.  For our freebie dessert we chose the Salted Carmel Pizookie. There are just no words for how awesome it was.  The place was clean and comfortable.

And they are the best during happy hour. Mon-fri: 3-7 & Sun-mon: 10-close in the bar area. Most of the appetizers, flatbreads and mini pizzas are half off. And I love appetizers, so I usually order 3-5 of those and get to take some back home with me. With the huge verity for a foodie lover, I'm happy. lol The atmosphere is pretty nice and casual.
