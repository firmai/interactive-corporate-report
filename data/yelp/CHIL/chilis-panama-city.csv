Amy K.,"Jacksonville, FL",22,10,10,2.0,5/3/2015,"For a Sunday night, it's surprisingly busy. I got the nachos and they were mediocre. My problem with this chilis is the smell. It smells so strongly of stale beer, I would rather take my meal to go then eat in. You can definitely tell people come here to party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20
Shannon T.,"Ft Walton Bch, FL",6,15,1,2.0,9/4/2014,This location is terrible. The service sucked and that was putting it nicely. Took forever for anyone to come and seat us in the first place. Ordered drinks and had to go to the bar to actually get them. Food took forever as well. Horrible experience at this location never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20
Hollie D.,"Panama City, FL",111,19,11,5.0,1/28/2015,Great staff. Quick service. Good food. I enjoyed the lunch menu of soup and a burger. Both were very good and still large portion. I ended up bringing half the sandwich home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20
William W.,"Panama City, FL",11,34,23,2.0,10/25/2015,"What can I say. Took forever to get our drinks, no straws. Margarita came but waitress spilled half of it trying to shake it at the table. Waited for our food for 30 min and it wasn't busy. Waitress said mine was ready but not my wife's. Waited 15 more minutes and the food was brought out. My plate was hot but not my burrito. Guess it was under the heat lamp waiting for my wife's food to finish. Here's a hint, don't tell your customers their food is done and sitting in the back waiting for the rest of the order to be done. My food had a ""skin"" on it from sitting. Waitress never refilled my wife's drink, ever! I asked for a second margarita which the bartender delivered 15 minutes after I ordered it. My meal was finished so I drank my margarita while my wife's tea glass sat empty. Waitress asked the guy behind us three times if he needed anything to our ""Zero"" and we were there 10 minutes before him. My wife's prime rib bowl was not supposed to have the avocados and jalapeños. Avocados on top but luckily they didn't put the peppers on it. I got the prime rib burrito which wasn't bad but would have been better hot. Very little meat in both our meals. Mostly rice in mine. Overall not worth the $46 it costs and I still gave the waitress a 15% tip which was 10% more than she deserved. I have only been to this location twice and this was definitely my worst experience. Hit and miss I guess, if you have another favorite place to eat you might want to skip this specific Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20
Bill R.,"Dothan, AL",19,30,5,1.0,7/4/2014,"Very unprofessional !  Servers and bar tender watching videos on the phone. Inappropriate language was used, often loud enough for everyone to hear.

Steve R.,"Tyndall AFB, FL",2,8,,1.0,5/14/2014,"The restaurant was not busy.  The ACID ROCK music was blasting!  The server was nice but incredibly untrained.  We waited 65 minutes to get our food. The server left the empty appetizer plates on our table for at least 50 minutes until the food showed up.   My wife's food was missing.  My daughter and her boyfriend ordered shrimp with their meals and both orders of  shrimp came on the same plate.  My steak that I upgraded to 10 ounces for $4.00 and ordered Medium, was RAW. I did not eat it or send it back because you NEVER send food back unless you want them to spit on it or worse.  Since we had to wait so long, my 6 year old fell asleep before the food came so she ate nothing.  They ran out of beer glasses so we had some other glass that was not as big as a normal beer mug so I'm sure I didn't get my money's worth there either.  This Chili's in Panama City, FL has a bad reputation among the locals and should be closed.  We tried it one last time hoping they had improved, but they have not. I will not be back and I will advise others to avoid it.  Also, don't touch the game kiosk on your table unless you want .99 added to your bill without notice!  Theft is what I call that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20

THIS PARTICULAR CHILLI'S BITES THE BIG ONE!! The service is hit or miss.  Don't get me wrong, I love chilli's, BUT THIS PLACE....NO!  The service is inconsistent.  Once, I went here to get a quick take out order and the bartender didnt even bother approaching me before I left 10 minutes later.  Dont bother ordering something that you dont always get....it will be nasty.  I order the chilli and it was horrific!  Haven't been back since.....

Zachary H.,"Lompoc, CA",67,265,102,3.0,4/24/2013,It's the same as every other chilis.  The service was good though so if you want something safe and reliable you could do much worse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20
Ashley S.,"Panama City, FL",67,98,15,3.0,1/16/2011,"This Chili's is average.  We decided to go to Chilis for the 2 for $20 deal.  The food was good for a cheap meal.  The waiter seemed to be very busy but did keep up with our table.   We did order the chips and salsa and the salsa was very very watery!  We asked for some thicker salsa and the waiter brought us a better salsa!  Why wouldn't you start with your best salsa?  I guess the watered down salsa is first and if you don't like that, then the good stuff is served :-) Nothing else to complain about but nothing really great to say about it either.  3 stars is all I can give Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20
Aimee C.,"Longwood, FL",301,124,40,4.0,6/19/2009,"We had lunch here yesterday.  It was a Thursday, around 1pm, and there was no waiting whatsoever.  We had a party of 8 plus 1 infant. Our server was awesome!  She kept the drinks full and had a great ""table-side"" manner. Four the three kids (one 6 year old and two 2 year olds) at the table we ordered one plate of Big Mouth Bites, which is four mini burgers and a side (we chose fries).  The fries were excellent and there wasn't a burger to be found at the end of the meal.  The kids gobbled it all up! I ordered the Chicken Fajitas Quesadilla.  It was pretty good... it paled in comparison to my husband's entrée of Crispy Chicken Crisper Tacos.  The sauce on these tacos was so flavorful!  He graciously let me have half of one. Anyway, our experience at this Chili's was great.  We'll definitely be back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city?start=20

Jacqueline B.,"Panama City, FL",40,24,1,2.0,7/9/2017,"I would give this restaurant 2.5 stars - because the food was actually GOOD (alas, there is NO 1/2 star on Yelp... sad trombone).  Yes, yes it was.  The chips, salsa, and queso were fresh and correctly seasoned, the booze was buy-one-get-a-second-one-free, BFF had a flatbread for an entree, I had the sliders, and then we shared the dessert - an Oreo molten lava cake.  The food was TASTY. But the service??  No.  Just no.  We should've gone to Pepper's - but since it was so ""late"" (8:45 PM is close to the ""sidewalks roll up"" time here in racy PC) - we decided to go to Chili's - even though Pepper's was still in high stride when we rolled by.  Red Lobster (across from Chili's) was still going strong, Panera was still throwing salads, and IHOP was filled.  My first mistake was even parking and getting out of the car when we arrived.  The parking lot was dismal.  Walked inside and waited for someone to seat us.  Waited.  Finally, a hostess/server approached us!!  We chatted a bit and I asked for a ""fun"" waitress (BFF and I live far apart and don't get together often - and I wanted to drink like a fish - plus we love to gab and crack on each other) - so she seated us in her section.  I don't even know if there was another server, as the place was empty.  The bartender, although nice, was busy telling everyone about BETTER establishments in Panama City and the Great Beyond.  FFS. Fun??  Not really.  Barely FUNctional.  Very little rapport.  Tried, but the server seemed otherwise mentally occupied.  Ordered my first Long Island - BFF gets water (she's the designated driver) - at the same time, we order our appetizer - salsa, chips, and beef queso.  Appetizer comes out before I even get my drink - we're halfway through the app before my booze even hits the table.  Le sigh.  Two drinks come because BOGOF - so I'm double-fisting it.  Server flits by, asks if we're ready to order, I'm not - and then pulls a no-show for a hot fifteen minutes.  The place is dead.  Doldrums.  The music was good - but even that was muted.   Finally ordered.  Food arrives - delicious.  The person running the food out looked like the chef and he looked like he cared (thank you, sir!!).  We enjoyed.  I ordered another drink (meaning another TWO) and they come out.  WAY faster than expected - which was shocking considering how sluggish things seemed to be.  Server keeps breezing on by, asking ""are you guys okay?"" while not even stopping.  She didn't bother to get empty glasses or even simply bus dirty dishes as she went by.  No napkins on the table - so we had to ask the bartender.  The bartender is accommodating and gives us a pile of them.   Both of our tabs are dropped on the table and our server disappears again (split check - specified BEFORE service - I'm paying for the booze, BFF is paying for the food).  So, my friend puts out her credit card - and even though I'm handed my check, I tell the server that I'm not necessarily finished drinking (at that time, I didn't think I was done).  She shrugs and says she can add things to the check... but never came back after dropping off my friend's credit card slip to even bother to ask if I wanted another drink.   One word:  BUZZKILL. Both my BFF and I have been in the service industry - and I'm ashamed to say that I tipped $4.00 on a $16.00 bar tab.  My friend also tipped about 20% (this is NOT our typical M.O. - as we usually start at 30% and only go up from there).  It was... pathetic service (except for the kitchen staff - chef and crew - who did put out some GREAT food).  If I could've given the kitchen staff a tip, I would have merrily rushed in there and handed out tips.  For what little business there was at Chili's - they deserved something extra for just staying open and offering a full menu. Considering the amount of family-friendly casual chain restaurants available in this area, you'd think that Chili's would step it up a bit.**  The kitchen was on point, but the service was pretty poor.  If the owners/operators could get the back of house synced with the front of house, I don't see how this restaurant could go Tango Uniform.   As for me, I won't be going back anytime soon.  Oh, and just for chuckles and whatever, they don't even have free wifi.  Like a final parting crotch shot from a girlfriend who is leaving her boyfriend... NO WIFI.   What is this??  A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY??  Savages!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city

Dayna G.,"Lynn Haven, FL",9,12,,1.0,1/22/2017,"We've always enjoyed coming here, but we just walked out and probably won't be back. We were greeted (if you could call it that) by a man who told us it was open seating in the bar. I turned to my fiancé to ask if he wanted to sit in the bar or in the dining room and turned back to the host. When I went to tell him we wanted dining room, he pointed to the bar and told us to sit wherever we wanted. He took the people in front of us to their table, and thinking he would see us and come back, waited up front to ask for a table. There were maybe five tables seated, so clearly it's not a busy day. He and two other waiters looked at us standing up front, for at least ten minutes, and just left us standing there. We didn't want to wait any longer for someone to acknowledge us, so we walked out.

First impressions are everything and when we sat down the bartender had such an attitude and actually acted and tried not to surge us. We're in the military out here on a detachment. We came in after dinner, went to the bar and started ordering drinks I asked the bartender (older guy white goate and flat top) to order a celebratory drink for one of my guys getting out of the military. He said what do I want cus he's limited on stuff he can put in it. I told him what was in the drink and he said he doesn't have it. I said well it can have anything in to as a base, he said well I don't have time for this so no, and walked away.

Didn't say anything and pointed toward the bar and said have a seat over there. Awesome part, they didn't have anything available in the menu except things that were already or simply prepared. Convenient, right? Asked for table side guac... Definitely got regular guac with the waiter mixing in tomatoes that were placed on top. The reason for no table side? ""The avocados are too squishy.""

When we were waiting to cash out the manager was headed out (home), he stops sees that we are waiting to pay realizing that we have been there far too long...he stakes out check and payment and cashes us out himself, and also gave us gift cards to return and enjoy some of their famous baby back ribs!!!  Just his simple gestures made what was a ""I'm not coming back here for a while"" experience turn into a ""they tried, they were helpful, I'm coming back"" experience!   The fact that the manager went out way meant a lot to me and my family and we greatly appreciate it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-panama-city

Another time, 5?years back maybe ,  was with someone and we sat in a booth in the bar and ordered appetizers. And drinks we ended up Going somewhere else. And the place wasn't busy. Then , my girlfriend and I were taking her parents for her dads b day. We ended up w about 8 people showing for dinner. That was a disaster. The waiter I think was trying to make all the tip himself and didn't want help from the other staff. My salad was soup. Literally soaked like 3 napkins.
