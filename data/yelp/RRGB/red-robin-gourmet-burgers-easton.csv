Steven B.,"White Plains, NY",2,35,10,5.0,8/11/2017,"Went here with the kids for dinner.  Our waitress, Beth, was awesome.  She was super attentive and made sure we always had what we needed. Th food was great, I really enjoyed the ""Black & Blue"" burger and the endless garlic Parmesan steak fries were great as well. Kids Grilled Cheeses were good size and judging by how much they ate - they enjoyed them as well. This was exactly what we were looking for - a family friendly place with good food and good service! Keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton
Joujou N.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,179,402,2.0,1/11/2018,Their service was  5 stars.  Our waitress was super helpful and informative. The food. Ughhhhhhhhhh It was horrible. Soooo bad. How can you mess up pretzel bites? They tasted like they were frozen and reheated in the microwave. Soggy exterior and dry inside. And the cheese dip-blahhhh-lumpy and salty. The burger was all greasy and the chicken teriyaki wrap was dry. The potatoe soup was super salty.  I think the only thing that was half way decent was the steak fries-probably because I requested them not to have them salted.  1st and last time I ever set foot at a Red Robin. The food quality is bad and unhealthy. Also pricey compared to other places in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton
Ross B.,"Parsippany, Parsippany, NJ",0,4,,1.0,1/14/2018,"Based on parking, I thought there would be a long wait, however we were seated immediately... at a dirty table with enough spot lights on it I thought I was part of a display.  15 min after seating we still haven't seen a waitress. One table is waiting for her to show up so they can leave. One table has ordered based on the lack of menus on their table but still no drinks on their table and there before us. The next table near us had something wrong with their food. Manager looked more like the dishwasher and less like a supervisor. Finally get table wiped off and order drink and another 15 goes by still no drinks. We left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton

Jen C.,"York, PA",2,34,5,2.0,5/26/2017,"Came in for dinner after graduation ... I don't typically eat at this kind of restaurant, being the healthier foody sort. So there's my disclosure. But this place disappoints; you place your own appetizer order and pay at the table, again yourself with a table top computer/IPad hybrid thing. First you have to separate the check if you need to- that is not an option when ordering now. The server sort of gets dumbed down to a retriever- silverware when they forget it, salad dressing when they forget it, sauces and sides when they forget it... The theme is- the server is not really trained for customer service here. I feel like servers should be trained well so they can be tipped well for full service.  Food? Solid C: Cold mealy fries and oversized plates with overcharged entrees.  Skip it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton
Carl D.,"Wind Gap, PA",0,111,1,4.0,8/18/2017,"Have eaten here dozens of times over the years and have always had a good experience. Tonight was no different.

Turk M.,"Easton, PA",0,11,,4.0,11/10/2017,"I gave this restaurant 4 stars because the food and service was wonderful. However, I cannot add the 5th star because the seating is less than comfortable.

Dom P.,"Macungie, PA",1,16,,1.0,8/8/2017,"This place is getting worse and worse every time I come here. Their is always a problem. I have encountered times where they ran our of plates! Yes, no plates in restaurant!! I have also had issues with them running out of food, getting the order wrong, and having the wait staff not be around for over 30 minutes! The last time I went their is was about empty (maybe 3-4 tables occupied) and I waiting over 15 minutes before a waiter even noticed we were there!!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, and HORRIBLE!! I left and will never eat here again. This is a shame because the food is good, I may just take a longer ride and go to another RR's. DO NOT COME HERE!!You will run into an issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton
Marc B.,"Bethlehem, PA",15,4,,2.0,3/18/2017,"Went here prior to an early movie so arrived about 5pm. Fairly empty so service was prompt and food was out quickly.  Ordered their version of a French Dip, The Prime Rib Dip, and it was very disappointing. The entire sandwich was only 5-6 inches long and there was no more than 2 thin layers of beef. This in and of itself was disappointing for the $15 price tag but even more so was the COMPLETE lack of flavor and seasoning both in the beef AND in the au jus.  If you've ever eaten when you had a cold and couldn't really taste anything, that was the experience with this sandwich. I thought it must be me so I asked my daughter to taste it and she said the exact same thing, ""it has NO flavor!"" Their sandwich is an enigma and a total waste of 15 bucks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton

Kendra L.,"Nazareth, PA",51,24,,3.0,7/2/2017,Food was ok service was less then ok. Went here yesterday for my nephews third birthday. The waitress seemed less then interested in us. We had to beg for drink refills and the food seemed to take forever and we are a family that doesn't mind hanging out and talking but it surpassed that amount of time. Food was ok and when they sang happy birthday to my nephew it seemed as though we asked them all to do the worst thing ever.

Jenn S.,"Morristown, NJ",0,33,5,2.0,9/16/2017,They never get the order right. I have tried so many times. One time I ordered a veggie burger and somehow got a regular burger with all kinds of random toppings on it. Today I ordered pretzel bites to go. The plastic cup that the dip comes in was melted. I guess from the microwave. Save your time and $ and go elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton
Ryan P.,"Easton, PA",8,1,,1.0,8/20/2017,This place is awful. Long wait and horrible service for mediocre food. milkshakes are terrible and insanely expensive.

C P.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",0,3,,2.0,10/23/2016,"The service was pretty good, from the time we were greeted by the host until leaving. I can attest to the other reviews that the front had a few high school aged workers lounging around. The poor rating, for me, comes from the food. My significant other and I ordered one of the gourmet burgers and the grilled cheese melt. After waiting over 30 minutes for the items on a seemingly dead Sunday afternoon, our food arrived. The grilled cheese melt contained neither the grilled or melt part, just cheese. A few slices of different cheeses that were warm, at best, between two slices of slightly toasted bread. The burger was luke  warm and fairly rare when it was ordered medium well. It bared no resemblance to what was described on the menu. Neither of us finished our meals. Thankfully, their fries are always on point and are bottomless. Fair service, sub par food, will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton
Tony P.,"Kaneohe, HI",1,14,,4.0,6/22/2016,"Everything you expect from Red Robin.  Good food, good value, clean restaurant, friendly service.  The Royal Robin was cooked perfectly with a nice runny egg and the onion rings were the best as usual.

Sabrina K.,"Stewartsville, NJ",0,21,2,1.0,9/19/2016,"I have had terrible service before, but this takes the cake!  My party of 5 consisted of 3 children.  For appetizers we ordered 2 spinach artichoke dips (used to be my favorite around).  They were luke warm at best.  For dinner we ordered Meatballs kids meal, chicken tender kids meal, and a corn dog kids meal.  Then my BF and I ordered hamburgers.  It took almost an hour and some complaining to the manager before our food was brought out to us.  The burgers were delicious...I'll give them that.  The meatballs were good according to my youngest.  The other two both ended up with corn dogs. They were so burnt black that what was remaining of the hotdogs inside the charred cornmeal were peeling apart inside!  How they allowed them to service anyone those corn dogs is beyond me!  Of course we called our manager over again.  He was again apologetic and had new ones made up again.  We didn't bother telling him that one was supposed to be chicken tenders!  Our waitress was so slow that we ran out of drinks constantly and she was no where to be seen.  We almost jumped up and filled our own glasses since the drink station was right there.  Figured that would be frowned upon.  Well, we got our almost warm spinach/artichoke mush and the three kids meal disasters for free, but it was definitely not worth going, even though we fed the entire family for $30.  (So not worth it!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton

Kathy K.,"Flemington, NJ",1,28,9,2.0,12/20/2015,"2 stars because it was edible ... Only Half way decent food, sub par service. This place has no business serving a $15 gourmet burger. Menus were strewn all over the seats around the entry way. The staff was like a crew of high school students working in a cafeteria. Our waitress was too busy cleaning the ordering area & taking trash out to tend to us. Ketchup & salt bottles were empty at our table we had to fetch our own from another table, she didn't even notice. Black & blue burger was just ok almost tasted like meatloaf w/ a sparce amount of blue cheese served with a very small pile of Luke warm French fries. They were supposed to be endless fries  but she never came by to see if we needed more. Other tables had little computer screens on them ours did not. Never going back again. Big over rated rip off.

Michael A.,"Allentown, PA",0,6,2,1.0,9/24/2016,I went to this Red Robin on Saturday 9/24 at around 3PM. I ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. It took about 25 minutes and the place was not packed whatsoever. When I did get my sandwich I had about 10 fries (Bottomless??) and my waffles were frozen. I settled for a different bun for my chicken because I was so hungry. You would have thought the manager would have let me have that sandwich on the house since I literally ate chicken and bread with a measly 10 French fries instead of what I actually ordered. Instead he wouldn't come over to meet me and told the waitress he would take 2 dollars off my meal. 2 dollars?? I didn't even finish my meal because it was gross. I will never eat at this branch ever again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton?start=20

After asking for the manager,who did not believe me, I demanded he find my card or call the police. He then threatened to call the police on me. I offered to call them for him.

Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419,3.0,8/24/2012,"Typical uneven all over the place chain dining where it's guaranteed that either the food or service will disappoint every time. The biggest issue yesterday during our lunch was our server. She was very, very slow and she was assigned apparently to cover tables in various sections of the Lehigh Valley. That plus total inattentiveness equaled taking an extra half an hour for something that should have been much quicker considering that we were there after the lunch rush. The food itself was as advertised in that it was chain quality average. Nothing great but at the same time nothing wrong either. After our food came our server ""K"" right on cue disappeared. Ask how our meal was?  No Drink refill for me?  No Drink refill for the children?  No Thank goodness that the A/C was barely on and that the place was rather hot because at least the ice in our drinks had melted enough so as to keep us hydrated less we may have expired from dehydration. But the best part was for last when after disappearing for over twenty minutes she brought me a big basket of fries while dropping off the check.  The problem was that I never said that I wanted more fries when instead obviously another beverage would have been awesome. Overall this RR is a great place if you are crazy hungry and don't care about how/when/if your food is delivered to you in a proper/timely manner. I'll bump the rating up a bit because the food was fine but the service here was flat out suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton?start=20

Alexis B.,"Easton, PA",0,3,,3.0,3/12/2015,"I've gone to this Red Robin a few times and never had any problems. Service was good, food was good. But I recently went and the service wasn't that great. Our waitress didn't take dirty plates off the table, didn't notice when we needed drink refills. I wasn't even halfway done with my burger yet when she came over and asked if we're paying with cash or credit, and then proceeded to open the check up on the ziosk. She didn't bother coming back after that to get plates, or more drinks, didn't even ask if we wanted to have dessert. She was rushing us out the door and we weren't even done eating yet.

Thad D.,"West Wyoming, PA",0,28,,4.0,3/28/2015,"While this is a chain and they aren't setting the culinary world on fire, my most recent experience here left nothing to complain about. My date ordered a raspberry cream soda and I a strawberry milkshake which were enjoyable and refreshing. The drink menu features many of the latest mixology trends like beer milkshakes and cocktails. My date and I got nachos as an appetizer - the portion was large and the chili sauce tasty. For an entree, I got the Blue Ribbon burger which wasn't overly messy or overcooked. My date ordered the guacamole burger and enjoyed it. We both liked the fries (we only got one portion each). It was a busy Saturday, but our food came out quickly and the server was attentive. It was very loud in the building; large groups with kids took up most of the seating. And of course, the usual chain-style birthday celebrations were taking place. The table-side kiosk allows for quick ordering and payment. Overall, a solid meal and good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton?start=20
Lindsay L.,"Easton, PA",118,12,6,1.0,7/28/2015,"Worst service, food I've ever had!  Suggested Red Robin bc my girlfriend had never been there and wanted decent drinks and good, quick food.  What we got was cold food  and the service was even worse.... we dined outside on a Monday night  (last night).... drinks took atleast 10 to 15 minutes to receive... the food came out cold and not even what we ordered.  My friend asked for her salad dressing 3 times before it even came out.  I found a piece of fried chicken in the bottom of my honey mustard cup... I was not even eating fried chicken.  My fries were cold, which I believe should never be the case, considering that's probably the item they make the most of. The clam chowder looked terrible and was barely warm.  My other girlfriend ordered a wrap and whatever came in it,was not what it said on the menu.... I've been in the food service industry for 15 years and I've never complained once.. but this really got to me.  Everything about the place was wrong.  Definitely not a place I'll be coming back to ever again.... funny thing is, I've worked in this location before and I've never seen it this bad.... the staff,including wait, management and kitchen, must all be new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton?start=20

And this is coming from someone who puts hot sauce on everything. It was too hot for me. I actually had to take the jalapeños off, because that combing with the ghost pepper sauce was simply too much. But all in all, I'd still tell anyone to go there, since it's really great food and good service. The computers at the table are also really great.

Sabrina D.,"Collegeville, PA",34,7,,2.0,12/7/2010,"Just got around to writing this review, but wanted to share my experience. I have never been to this location, I was passing through while coming back home from the Poconos. I ordered a burger and fries, I can't remember the name of it, but it came with guacamole. It was average, and the fries were okay, but I prefer my fries more thinly cut. All in all the service was pretty good. However....once I got back home, about an hour later I got violently sick. I have never had food poisoning before, but I was pretty sure this is what it was. The ONLY thing I had to eat that day was that burger and fries. I wasn't sure if the sickness came from the guacamole or the meat, but let me tell you, I NEVER want to be that sick again, I was throwing up, shaking, chills, headache, severe stomach cramps, etc. I couldn't move out of bed. I called Red Robin and asked to speak to a manager, I got him on the phone and told him what was going on and asked if there were any other reports. Now mind you, I had no intentions of suing or getting my money back or whatever, I just wanted to warn them that something there was tainted. The manager immediately got defensive and assured me that no other cases had been reported and asked if I was sure that is how I got sick. I told him I'm positive as this was the only thing I ate all day, I was feeling completely fine up until an hour after consuming that meal. The manager was very unsympathetic, didn't apologize and didn't ask what he could do or anything. Needless to say I will NEVER eat at another Red Robin again, the thought of that tainted nasty burger is forever burned into my mind...and by the way, I have  not been able to eat another burger since that day....it is December and this happened in August, which  the day I went there was my birthday...happy birthday to me, love Red Robin! Never again...just wanted to give a little warning....I can't be 100% sure, but I think the guacamole is to blame, I was the only one in my party who had it. I'm just turned off by the lack of concern or sympathy by management, the fact he got so defensive really tells me something. No way I wasn't going to write a review about this. Red Robin for the attitude I received lost many customers, because I told EVERYONE I knew about this incident and all of them said they would never go there again. Good job Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton?start=40
