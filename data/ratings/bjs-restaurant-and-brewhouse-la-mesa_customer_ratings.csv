285,John J.,"San Jose, CA",385,506,737.0,1.0,2012-01-09,"This is the second 1-star I have ever given, because this place has rubbed me the wrong way. I never ate here because I was precluded from that possibility on my birthday. I was excited to come here for the free pizookie on your birthday as was advertised, and so believing in their credibility, I came to BJ's. While I had no intention to dine in that night, I was very clear to the front of the house that I just wanted to receive the free pizookie. The front said OK, that I could get it at the bar where it was open seating, since the house was packed. So I sat at the bar. The bartender asked me what I'd like, and I said the free pizookie. Then he said that I actually had to dine-in in order to get it. Perturbed, as the ad did not mention any such stipulation, I proceeded to ask what was the cheapest thing on the menu. The barman said it was probably chips and salsa for $7. After that, I decided to leave. Essentially it was $7 for a pizookie that was supposed to be free.  Even though I wasn't going to eat here, I was offended at their lack of credibility. The front and the bar told me contradictory things; the free pizookie was in fact, not free at all! For $7, I can just make a dozen pizookies at home, and I wouldn't have bothered coming here at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=300,3.76,3.77,3.77,2.6920000000000006,3.766

My favorite is the half flatbread pizza with a side salad for 6.95.  I ordered the California flatbread with cheese, bacon, chicken melted om top with ranch dressing drizzled over the toppings. The side salad came with some fresh dark greens, including spinach, chopped onions, thin carrot slices, tomatoes and balsalmic dressing.  Add a side of happy face potato fries with ranch dipping sauce for yourself or your kid. They are moist and delicious!

Took 15 minutes for our server to even notice we were there. The guy seemed new or nervous or hungover or hell I don't know. The service was awful. We ordered the veggie burger and veggie pizza, and WOW if you love food that is EXTREMELY okay tasting, then totally try these items out. I understand that this is not a restaurant that caters to vegetarians but if you're going to have vegetarian items they should at least be up to the standards of the rest of your food. The veggie burger was almost entirely rice and literally had no taste (thank heavens for onion and ketchup, I would say the cheese helped but I wasn't offered it for some reason). The veggie pizza actually tasted like something if you poured a gallon of red pepper flakes on it.

I have only sat at the bar area and it takes some time to get service there it seems. One time I actually came here on a date and was sitting next to to women. They were in deep conversation with the bartender (slowing down our drinks) and their conversation became so comical that my date and I were mocking them while listening to the ridiculous conversation...not long after the bartender came around from behind the bar to give one of the girls a massage!

417,Mary W.,"San Diego, CA",45,79,,3.0,2012-03-14,"As a chain restaurant I should give BJ's more credit. But for me, the pizza was crummy, had small portions and wasn't all that reasonably priced. The beer selection is decent, but the restaurant itself is really small, so a group of more than 5 will feel really cramped. Also due to the size BJ's is really really loud (like bar loud), which makes you almost have to shout to chat with those you are eating with.

580,Frank C.,"Jackson, OH",6,17,,4.0,2012-03-30,"Since living in La Mesa, I've frequented the Bj's brewery somewhere close to 15 times. Out of those times I've only actually waited to be seated 4, with wait times varying from 5-30 minutes. So, I can't add much input on how quick you are to get seated. I usually just drift over I the open seating bar area. Never have i had trouble finding a seat there with a party size of 2-4.  The customer service is spectacular. Maybe it's because I'm so good looking ;-) but, I always get greeted and treated like I'm at Hooters! The bartenders and waiters/waitresses are second to none. Smiles from the time I sit down until the time I sneak out after leaving my cell number on the receipt along with a MUAH! And a generous tip. =) Any place with a menu that is 10 pages long, with 5 of those pages consisting of just mixed drinks(which are amazing and a wide variety), wines, and craft(A++) domestic, and imported beers, is always a winner in my book! I've yet to have a bad meal here. This would be 5 stars if the jambalaya would have been more spicy. I enjoyed it but, if a guy from the great state of Ohio says it needs more spice, then it needs more spice! Other than that, this is a great place to go sit at the bar watch a ball game and relax with friends!!

396,Beth W.,"San Diego, CA",118,210,18.0,4.0,2012-04-01,"BJ's is certainly not on the top of my list, but for a chain restaurant its pretty good! It has an extensive menu that should please almost everyone in your group - young and old alike. The decor is standard and honestly, if you've been to one BJ's you've been to them all.  The bottom line is that they have a great selection of beers and tasty pizzas. The atlantic salmon filet (blackened) with lemon chardonnay butter sauce, rice pilaf and steamed vegetables is also surprisingly good and the pizookie (a large, hot, melt-in-your-mouth delicious cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream) is a must have.  The La Mesa location is filled with families and is far from being a hot spot. However, if you want to have a low key evening, try sitting in the bar area where the servers are on point and they have several tv's to view from almost every seat.

429,MariGrace B.,"San Diego, CA",61,23,,2.0,2012-04-15,"Very disappointed in my visit to this location of BJ's.  As a chain it is one of my favorite places to eat.  With a menu that can satisfy almost any craving and deserts that are scrumptious, and custom drinks that are killer, what more could one ask for.   How about some decent service?  It started as early as when I was being seated.  I was being seated at a table for 2 - one of the small booths.  There was a section of 4 of them empty, 3 ready to go with silver wear and everything and one that had nothing on it yet and was soaking wet.  The hostess takes me to the wet table.  I mentioned that it was extremely wet and she just said, well yes they just cleared it.  I did not sit and with a sigh she said would you rather sit here.  I cordially said yes.   At first the server seemed pleasant and decent, but then it seemed things were taking a really long time.  He had to be asked for refills of the non-alcoholic beverages and this wasn't only at our table.  The one next to us was out of water and he stopped by both tables and never bothered to fill any water or bring more pop without being expressly stopped and asked.   Also he completely missed one of the items we ordered, and never brought the lemon for my water.   Then there is the quality of the food.  I have never had an issue with BJ's before.  It has always been great.  The avocado egg rolls were as they normally are - yummy.  But then came my Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato salad.  The balsamic on the plate was crusted and dry - seeming as though the salad had been out for a long time.  Also there was a lot of some thin liquid all over the plate - I believe it may have been tomato juice, but not positive.  Next came the pizza, a mini cheese and tomato.  Normally this is my absolute favorite item,  This time it came with one clump of tomatoes directly in the center of the pizza, and not a lot of cheese.  I had to spread the tomatoes out myself, and their texture seemed a little off.  My friend said her salad was good. Then we ordered desert, which took forever to get out of the kitchen, but the runner who brought it was very pleasant and was joking with us.  We had a few bites, but were pretty well stuffed so for the most part we left it.   Overall this is probably my worst experience at a BJ's.  Had I not been to other locations previously I would be inclined to never eat any of them again.  I certainly will not return to this location.  Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=440,3.2,3.66,3.712,2.8240000000000003,3.476000000000001

436,Luckey D.,"La Mesa, CA",2,58,15.0,2.0,2012-05-01,"Hubby and I went with my Aunt and her 3 grandkids as a thank you for doing some work for her.  We got there a few minutes after them and they had already been seated.  We asked the hostesses if a woman had come in with twins and a girl and they had no idea but let us walk around and find them (we found them in the second booth from the hostess stand). The family had already ordered the quesadilla appetizer and it was good.  Hubby and I ordered the small size Sweet Pig deep dish to share.  My Aunt ordered the mini vegetable pizza but was brought the small deep dish vegetable pizza because they ran out of dough for the mini (at 5 pm? you can't just pinch dough from the larger size to make a smaller amount?).  But they only charged her the mini size price so that was fair. The kids ordered from the kids menu--ribs with fries and extra fries, Mac & Cheese (which I swear was just blue box Kraft) and chicken tenders. My aunt didn't want the kids to have dessert but offered to pay for my husband and I to have one.  We tried to explain this to the waiter but he didn't grasp the concept of adding it to the bill but serving it after they left. So, about our server...I wish I could tell you his name but they don't wear nametags--he had a faux hawk and light brown hair.  They also don't write down orders.  While it's impressive to remember larger orders I find it unnecessary in a casual place like BJ's and actually just more annoying for the servers to have to remember all that stuff.  Our server got our orders right but presented my aunt with the wrong, $20 higher, bill.  He corrected it and said ""I think you'll like this total much better"" but he forgot to include the dessert we wanted and my aunt ended up giving us $5 cash. I asked the server for a menu to pick our Pizookie and it took forever to get a menu.  Then we saw the calorie count on the Pizookie (1,000-ish calories depending on flavor) and said forget it!  We took our $5 to See's and got a few pieces of candy to last a few days instead of having to ingest and extra 500 calories each at one sitting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=440,3.2,3.62,3.704,2.8560000000000003,3.452000000000001

371,Margaret D.,"San Diego, CA",823,730,90.0,1.0,2012-07-03,"My group arrived around 5:30 with plans to see a movie at 8:20 at the theater. We had already purchased tickets, so we just needed to walk over. Three hours is plenty of time for dinner, right? It was my mother's group Mom's Night Out and everyone was looking forward to relaxing and eating before the movie. The hostess said we weren't getting seated until 6 because the patio server did not arrive until 6. I got a drink in the bar. When I went to settle my tab, paying for my single drink took about 10 minutes because I couldn't nab the waiter. It was not overly busy-- a Monday night with many empty tables at 5:45. He rang it up for a non-happy hour price, which he caught and corrected immediately.   The hostess then allowed us to sit out on the patio a few minutes early with drinks from the bar.  When the waiter arrived, a couple of women asked toward the beginning for separate checks, waiter said he would do that. There were 2-3 additional servers helping out, so they were not short of staff. People had trouble getting drink orders early on. A friend who arrived later went out of the bar and bought her drink-- she is a waitress and said she hates it when people do that, but felt it was quicker. Waiter asked if anyone wanted apps. We said we were ready to order dinner and did so. Three people got apps, one to eat as the main course. The women indicated they wanted the apps at the same time as the main course. They set out app plates for everyone and brought the apps out before the main. My friend ordered a sirloin, medium-rare. It was well-done. Like, very well done. She waited for someone to appear so she could tell them, but no one did, so another friend went out and grabbed someone. There was a group of servers just inside the door who were not doing anything, though not assigned to our table. The waiter brought her another steak, also well-done. She brought this to their attention again. Finally the manager came out and said the waiter had written down ""medium well"" instead of ""medium rare"" and they had just figured it out. By the time they brought Steak 3, she was full on potatoes and green beans. Another annoying bit: when they gave her a new plate, they did not clear the old. So I stacked them up for her after I was done with my plate.  I got the ""Maui pork chop."" It was supposed to have a spicy glaze but it was dry and hard on the outside with no flavor. My roasted red potatoes were soggy and some of them cold. I did not point this out because it seemed like it would completely overwhelm the staff . The lady across from me got the Hawaii Mahi over rice, and she was salting it heavily and pouring lemon on it because it was bland.  After the disappointing entree, I wanted to order dessert, but nobody ever came by for the order. The lady beside me ordered dessert, grabbing the waiter as he went by. No one else got a dessert order in. 25 minutes later, she had no dessert and asked where it was. He said it was coming and brought it out 30 seconds later.  At about 745 we asked for the check, figuring that 15-20 minutes was plenty of time to pay. It was not. The guy had not separated the checks and went around asking what everyone had had and writing it down. So by 810, we still did not have the checks. Once I got mine, I went out front and got the manager to ring it up. He said the problem was that we asked for separate checks. ""When you ask for separate checks, it takes longer for our system to process it,"" he said. Really? It takes your system almost 3 hours to process it, because that was asked for at the beginning. Also, if they do not want to do separate the checks, that is fine; the restaurant can just say they don't want to. It is unacceptable to agree to it and then not want to do it. And the waiter and manager did know we needed to leave before the checks came. And separate checks have nothing to do with service. I did not argue because all I wanted to do was go see the movie. Anyway, it was a big hot mess. We got movie seats, but down in the way way  front.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=360,3.36,3.5,3.672,2.9480000000000004,3.4440000000000004

571,A C.,"San Diego, CA",67,4,,1.0,2012-09-19,"We had a horrible experience at this restaurant....twice. Unluckily, we got the same waitress both nights. The first night she was not terrible, but not good. Last night, it was so bad that I almost walked out. I do not undertip and I respect waitstaff, because I put myself through college as a waitress. However, this was horrible. Both times, we had some sort of issue, and NEITHER time did we get to talk to a manager about it. The smell in the bar/kitchen area is overwhelming. So much that we couldn't eat anywhere near them. Last night we got sat away from those areas. However, from the second we got there, it took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come take our drink order.  Now, I understand people get in the weeds and need help. So, he was helping our waitress, got our drink orders and brought them to us. Then, from the time we got our drinks to the time we ordered, it was about 20 minutes. And not once did we get a ""i'll be right with you"". Then, 35 minutes later our 1 flatbread pizza and 1 pasta dish.....(seriously) came out. My husband ordered a Jumbalaya dish that was super spicy. We had our waitress walk by about 3 times before she offered a drink refill (and it was out). So, he stopped eating because he needed a drink. Then she grabbed his glass, took another tables order, put that in, came back with a check for another table, gave them to go boxes, grabbed more to go boxes and boxed up their pizza for them, then went and got their check, grabbed the other tables credit card/check...ALL WHILE HOLDING HIS GLASS. So, 10 minutes later, his food was cold and he still didn't have a drink. Needless to say, our appetites were ruined, and the entire experience was awful.  The food was not horrible, but my order was incorrect, and for the sake of time, I didn't send it back. It was mediocre at best though.

That was pretty cool...I'm sure the night gets really crowded so I'm glad we didn't want to that.  It's horrible of me that we got seated so quickly that I can't describe anything about what the restaurant looks like...I really zoned out...plus I was busy catching up so had no time to focus on my surrounding (good thing there wasn't a crime and asked to give a description of the events that took place) Anywho, our waitress was super nice and un-intrusive (that's probably not a word) but we got enough attention to where nothing was missing.

Nothing particularly stood out to me but it was all definitely good.  We made the mistake of ordering more after the huge appetizer. I got the ""gourmet mac and cheese."" It was really good. At first it looked small but you find out the hard way that it's the right size. I ended up taking half of that home. Everyone raves about the pizzokie and we didn't get to try it, but I'll be back. I want to try the chicken bbq pizza since everyone I asked about the restaurant recommended it. The menu is huge!!!!

531,Jennifer M.,"San Diego, CA",83,65,21.0,2.0,2012-11-09,"To sum it up: Good food, but terrible service for a large group! If you'd like to read more, see below.  I recently had my birthday dinner here. We had reservations for 20 people. I'll never do that again! It was an hour after arriving that we received water and almost 1 hr and 15min  before we received our  drinks (beer, cocktails, sodas, etc).  At this point my guests were already annoyed, but we stayed because we had already ordered our dinner. Upon complaining to the server, we were told ""well, that's what happens when you all wanted to order your food right away (nevermind that he asked, ""would you like to get started ordering?""). And the bartenders are really backed up. I'm sorry but your drinks will be here shortly."" I was in shock that he managed to place blame, rather than just appreciating that we were frustrated. Later after our food arrived, I'd say about 65% of the orders were incorrect. The pizza crusts were switched, pizzas that were not supposed to have cheese came out with cheese, toppings were all switched around. We were so frustrated. By this point, I had to cancel my other plans for the evening because dinner had already taken 2+ hours and we were barely eating. When complaining about the mistakes for the food, the server was defensive (again) and not all that friendly. He blamed us for having ""complicated orders"".  The manager had spoke to me multiple times by now, apologizing profusely and saying he was embarrassed and couldn't believe this had happened. In the end, he took quite a bit off the bill, which we all appreciated, however I did not plan to spend my birthday evening chatting it up with the manager. I would've rather been chatting with my friends and enjoying my birthday dinner. I had to argue with the server (who by this point was pretending we didn't exist and only showing up when we actively flagged him over), that I wanted to eat dessert. About 20 minutes after the check had been paid, I reminded the server that it was my birthday (and that the manager promised me a free pizookie, to ease all the troubles of the evening). The server argued about if I could have the small or large pizookie. Sigh, unbelievable. Finally I got my bday dessert, but by this time over half my party had left.   On another note: the BBQ Chicken pizza on gluten free crust use to be amazing, but for some reason they felt like they needed to mix BBQ sauce and marinara sauce together now, so I wouldn't recommend ordering that.   In BJ's Pizza's defense,  EVERY other time I have gone there the service has been stellar, food delicious and no mistakes.   Go with a small party, don't order anything complicated and make sure you have plenty of time and you'll love this place.

That is fine but i really appreciate when I receive outstanding service.  That was the case this time my server in think her name was Jaclyn (SP?) tall with long dark hair was very informative with with regard to my questions about the menu and which would go best with my beer (Tantonka Stout .)I initially chose to drink.  I was not planning on getting an appetizer but Jaclyn talked me into trying the avocado egg rolls which I was not sure I would like,, wrong they were delicious. She made several  entree suggestions  and of those I picked the grilled pork chops a great match with the stout. The entree was prepared very well other than the veggies being a little over cooked. Jaclyn made sure my beer or water were never empty  and she quickly got me a new knife after I knocked my first one to the ground. FInally although I did not need it I was sold that I had to try the Red Velvet Pazookie, hot moist  and tasty.

It is a chocolate chip cookie that is cooked fresh and served with ice cream and a chocolate on top. It is the most amazing desert you will ever have.

We brought all of this to our waiters attention, he said he would get the manager. He came back shortly after and gave us the bill...with everything on it and never spoke to the manager for us. So I took it upon myself to go find him, he was very friendly and made it right by us, which was great. So two weekends later we decided to go back because we love it there. I got a daiquiri, and it was disgusting, so sour I couldn't even drink it. I went up to the bar to ask for a different one and I told the bartender what was wrong. He made me a new one, I watched him dump the sour mix in it, and it was worse than the first one, so I just said thank you and gave up on that. We ordered BBQ wings, and we were brought buffalo wings. We ordered a cheeseburger pizza with no onions. It came out with no pickles, but lots of onions.

222,Sophia Y.,"San Mateo, CA",816,1408,2385.0,4.0,2013-03-26,"PIZOOKIE PARTY!!! I don't know how we ended up with getting that, for I think we actually came for something else. Good choice on our part though. Four flavors of warm cookie topped with scoopfuls of ice cream on top. We got red velvet, raspberry white chocolate, cookies in cream and regular chocolate chip. It was delicious the first few bites. The combination of warm cookie and cold ice cream was SO good. Who would of thought hot and cold ever go together? The sugar eventually gets to you though as it is a humongous dessert. The red velvet was good but was definitely the sweetest. The raspberry white chocolate was good. We only got a hint of raspberry but the white chocolate definitely complimented it. The cookies and cream kinda tasted like a flat brownie. It's good if you like flat brownies. And surprisingly, the normal classic chocolate chip was my favorites. The cookie had a half baked taste but who doesn't like cookie dough and cookies? And I loved the warmness of a fresh out of the oven cookie. We had to wait a little longer because they actually burnt our first one. They came out and let us know that it was going to be a little while longer because they wanted serve us a good one. Fortunately, we didn't mind the wait and found it funny that they burnt our cookie. Like the description says, it's good for a party of 5 or more. That probably holds true as our party of 4 could not finish ours.  Overall, a good dessert!

466,ashley b.,"San Diego, CA",375,3,,1.0,2013-07-08,"I seriously HATE THIS PLACE. The ""chef"" is a complete douche bag. Hate to resort to name calling but there really is no better way to explain him. I have given this place several chances and every time is worst than the last. The experiences that stick out the most are as follows.  1- a few friends and I went out for dinner out food was ok at best but what made this time stick out was the fact that my vegetarian friend asked for the veggie burger and got a regular Burger, then she sent it back, after sending it back she got a cold veggie burger with an unmelted slice of cheese, we asked to speak to a manger and that's when the ""chef"" came over and just kinda rolled his eyes. And had then sent it back. My friend had been her quit a few times like me trying to give it a chance and she has worst story's. so she told him that this was not the first time she had something like this happen that's why he told her well if you keep getting BAD service don't come back. The kicker, she got her burger after the second send back and all they did was throw another piece of cheese on it. Wtf 2- my same friend actually was dumb enough to have her fiancé's birthday here. Well needless to say after telling us they didn't have room for us indoors they would manage something outdoors but we had to wait..... Ummmmm she had set reservations in advance. Don't act like you didn't know we were coming. Well we had a few guest that had to feel like outsiders because they had to sit at a completly separate table away from the group. Then after putting us outdoor on a cold day they said they would turn the heat on. Gee thanks. Well when we ordered our food  and the people who were isolated ended up never getting their food when we asked about it the waitress said she forgot to order it.... So I was very upset about this I asked to speak to the manager again and again he was a douche. And after lots of arguing with this guy he gave them there dinner HALF off. Seriously none if them even ate their food because we were all done by then and actually still sitting and waiting for their food to arrive so they just had it packe to go.  3- the straw that broke the camels back. So my family and I went in one day and we have an elderly grandmother (97) who is very picky about her food. Well all she asked was to not have mushrooms in her dinner. They server said he would take care of that. But when our food returned there were mushrooms. We asked about it and he said rolling his eyes well the chef said he is not rooming them so she is gonna have to herself. I was so shocked seeing how I was in the food industry and ya I have felt with my fair share of egotistical chefs and have been given this line before... They don't are about your tip... But guess what I cared about my tips and my clients being happy so I would take all the mushrooms out myself. Needless to say I'm sure that chef was the same dough bag as before.  So you ask why I have been so many time?!? Ok the food ok when it's made right or you get it. And I honestly thought I would for once have a decent dinner here.... Nope.  Also I think the servers are all just overwhelmed, they are understaffed and not trained well. And that chef is the worst. I'm sure that he is hell to work for and this is probably why all the servers look so overwhelmed and undertrained because they don't care to learn bc try hate their boss.

But the second time I went last night was what did me in.  My bf and I brought our friends along with us. his homeboy my homegirl. We decided to treat them out for the night. So we were seated down at a table very fast which was nice because it was packed. Had a great waitress to begin with until she went on break and we got a new one. Her name was and yes I WILL  name her in the review Carolyn. She was not as friendly or nice or sweet as the waitress we had when we first got there and ordered our appitizers with. I felt a not so good vibe off of her. I had asked to change my order in a good enough amount of time they said even after I told them it's not a problem if you can't or it's to late. First waitress said it's totally fine and she would make sure they changed it. Well the waitress CAROLYN had a major additude about it and for the rest of our night. We finally ordered desert and it just happened to be my boyfriends bf so he got a free one well Carolyn brought it right out and then left and then came back 10 mins later to tell me they didn't have the Binet I craved for about a half hour. 10 MINS LATER after bringing my man his!!!!! I jokingly said to my bf that she was making it up bc I changed my order and I could tell she wasn't happy about it even tho it didn't affect her in the slightest. She wasn't around when I said it so I know she didn't hear me bc no1 else at the table did either. so we were there probablly for a few couple of hours laughing talking enjoying our dinner. then she brought us our check and then we looked at it she left right as I was trying to tell her we needed 2 checks because one was paying cash and the other card. So she comes back 20 mins later we then explained that we needed two but we understand that it wasn't her fault because the first server didn't tell her that. Then she comes back 20 more mins later to give us the checks 2 seprate ones leaves the table comes back and takes my card for mine and my friends and my bf's $100 bill for his check for him and his friends dinner.  So I just happened to look at the suggested Gratuity b4 she put them into seperate checks which was 12 comething. We got our change back and my card i signed and my bf left her a 13 dollar cash tip for both of our checks. ONLY to find out this morning on my account was BOTH charges!!!!! So not only did she pocket the 48 dollars. But my card was charged twice and I was never told about this.  I called the manager this morning very upset and after having me on hold for 20 mins while he looked it up saying his system went down(Trick they use to get people to calm down) he apologized and said he takes full respoinibility for her F up! I told him why are you taking the responsibility she fed everything up. He then told me well she probablly just did everything on 1 card as 1 bill I told him NO bc then I wouldn't have 2 charges and then he told me the charge was reversed right away.SO THEN WHY THE HELL DIDN'T SHE TELL ME SHE MADE A MISTAKE SHE WAS GONE FOR LONGER THEN 10 MINS WITH MY CARD!!! i also told him well thats not true bc my card doesn't reflect that, I still have 48 dollars missing out of my account!!!!!! Then he asked was it a debit card I said yes but so what he then proceeded to tell me well the bank must be holding it and they will deicde when you get it back. He did say this should have never happened and then reiterrated that he takes full responisibility which made me even more mad! WHY THE HELL isn't CAROLYN BEING HELD ACCOUNTIBABLE!!! An why isn't anything being done for my troubles!!! That means I have to do all this work for something that wasn't my fault! They have until Tuesday to give me my money back shoot I might even go back there 2mrow night and raise hell bc everyone I have talked to says that my order should have been comp'd for all of this trouble and I know it should have been I WORK IN HOSPITALITY!

We were seated promptly, then a bright smiling waitress took our drink and appetizer orders. She then informed us she was going on her dinner date and Trevor would be taking over. Seemed a normal thing. We promptly got our root beer and waited eons for my Berry Burst Cider. Another table beyond us, large party arrived after us, had already received all their bar drinks before us. I stopped Trevor as he finished orders at another table and said I think my Cider was forgotten about. He then brought it in a jiffy. I ordered blackened salmon without the sauce due to an allergy. Trevor said he understood and he made the blackened style recommendation too. Food came a reasonable time later. To my dismay, the salmon was covered in the sauce along with the vegetables. *Sigh. Sent it back and the person said she'd tell my waiter. He came and apologized, along with shortly after a gentleman in an olive shirt and tie that didn't identify himself. Waited another ten minutes, food came and was correct this time thankfully. Dress shirt and tie guy came back to check, still didn't know his name or position. By now I was starving and the rest in my party had finished her salad already so I was eating my salmon alone. Desert was correct too. Check came, I honestly expected a discount on my salmon snafu, since I had taken the time to be meticulous about its preparation and my allergy, received confirmation and yet it was still wrong. No discount. I tipped 10%, out of kindness. It didn't meet my expectations and I'm not sure I'll be back, too bad because I'm a local and loooove their berry burst cider.

313,Jeff L.,"San Diego, CA",157,219,69.0,3.0,2013-09-14,"This review is for the bar area only.  I went here to watch a game and grab a few drinks. For Thursday there were happy hour specials as well as specials during the nfl game. I think the beer deal was 3.50 for their house brews, which was pretty good. I got the blonde ale and it was really smooth.  The prices outside of the happy hour menu were a little on the high side but not outrageous. We paid $17-18 for a half rack of ribs. The ribs were ok but not worth 17-18 bucks.  The real deal is that if you are going to watch a big game, they will have a huge tv dedicated. That is really cool but the atmosphere was pretty lame. Maybe the game was just pathetic but honestly the crowd was too eclectic to have any passion behind it.  Bottom line is that for an nfl game we got good drinks, average food, average service, and an average viewing experience. For all that, we paid $50 which doesn't seem like a lot but considering we got the ribs and that took up almost 40% of our bill we could have gotten a better value for our money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=340,2.8,3.35,3.564,2.604,3.13

D.,"San Diego, CA",40,88,,1.0,2013-09-21,"Two and half hours.  That's how long it took the four of us to get a simple one-course meal.  To be fair, we did ask our waiter two simple questions:  1) Was there a way to make a vegan pizza (my step daughter is vegan), and 2) did the kitchen take special care not to cross-contaminate for gluten free options during preparation.  We then ordered some appetizers and waited for our waiter to return with our answers so we could order our meal.  Well, the appetizers never arrived.  And neither did our waiter.  After about a half hour a new waitress appeared at our table (our first waiter was still in the restaurant, just pointedly avoiding us).  Our new server seemed completely unaware of either our appetizer order or our food questions, and she got busy getting those resolved. ....Another half hour and our appetizers arrived.  But still no answers to our questions.  So I went in search of a manager.  After standing for ten minutes or so by hostess station, ""Sean"" finally arrived.  I put my questions to him and, to my shock and amazement, he couldn't answer either one.  ""I'll have to check on that,"" he said, and disappeared.  I got the distinct impression that ""Sean"" was not the sharpest tool in the shed to begin with, and that perhaps the stress of his management position was a little beyond his capacity.  So I waited a few more minutes, and, when it was clear Sean wasn't returning anytime soon, I returned to our table.  At long last the waitress was now taking our order. Since we couldn't confirm any info regarding our dietary needs, I took a risk and ordered a GF pizza, and my step-daughter ordered a salad.  Another half hour later our main entrees began to trickle in...not together, but separately over a twenty-minute period.  It was ridiculous.  Then, as we approached the two hour mark and the last order (my step-son's regular pizza) hadn't yet arrived, I waived down our waitress.  ""Oh no!"" She declared, ""I completely forgot to put in his order!"" You get the picture. This wasn't the worst dining experience I've ever had...my GF pizza was actually pretty good and everyone else was happy with their meal as well (once the dishes finally arrived).  But the service was incredibly bad, even for San Diego's low standards. Lastly, I would also warn against ordering at the bar.  The bartender had little training and no clue about any of the drinks we wanted, or how to customize a drink, or even how to fix a drink he failed to mix properly.  My margarita was truly disgusting.

I mean, come on! How could we not go there and eat all that for $20.  It was pretty good and well worth the $20 but that's my main gripe with BJs. The food isn't that bad, but just like all these other chain restaurants, they charge way too much for the quality of food you're getting. If every item on the menu was about $3-$5 cheaper we'd probably come here for a quick bite more often. But as it is, paying $16 for meh fish and chips is not worth it to us. We'd rather go to a locally owned business and spend the same money there for halibut fish and chips. You get my drift? It's not bad food, but there is much better food to be had for the same amount of money or less. Their beer wasn't that great either.

Promise you'll most likely find something here ! They have a fairly huge menu! I think I have been here at least 20 times and had only great experiences. There was a few times when slower than usual - but that's understandable given how busy this place can be - and that's really just a few times out of the many many I've been.  Came here for the bajillionth time two days ago for lunch. Lunch specials are 11-3 Monday to Friday and they have a great selection ! My favorite is the Southern Fried Chicken for $6.95- it's the perfect portion and it's soooooo delicious. It's delicious mashed potatoes garnished with corn ...a delicious tender fried chicken is nestled on top and a delicious sauce is poured over. This time I got the spaghetti and meat sauce for $7.95 and it included a salad or soup. I love pasta ! Pasta was al dente and sauce was great- huge portions for lunch. Also included two garlic breads. Score! I got the chilli...it was mediocre at best ... not horrible but nothing to rave about. It was a simple chilli- not much flavor to it. I also tried the corn fritters appetizer. For $2.95 ... I couldn't be disappointed no matter what. This appetizer though was amaze-balls(literally !) - it was corn balls with bacon aoili..... Sooooooo good. Came with 4 pieces. Definitely recommend this - esp at such a great price. Knocked down a star because while all their food is pretty good - a lot of it can also be pretty bland and flavorless. Easy classics like spaghetti, Alfredo , soups , and breadsticks are good but just not that great. Luckily great prices and atmosphere make up for most of that :)  Always a hostess/host at the front which is nice. I never once had to wait and look around for someone. Great other selection of food (including their famous deep dish pizzas), unique beers with a great selection, and of course their famous pizookie dessert ...

332,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051.0,4.0,2013-12-24,"My BJ's Restaurant count stands at 3, with this most recent visit being number 3. Despite the fact that it was the last Friday before Christmas, and the fact that we were in a mall setting, the restaurant had a table for us surprisingly quickly. The answer to our question, ""How long is the wait for 2?"" was ""There is no wait."" Can't ask for more than that! The restaurant was pretty packed - and loud - so I was amazed that we were shown to a booth towards the back of the restaurant after less than five minutes. Our waiter was at our table within a minute, and he had our drink order back to our table within two minutes. The best part? I asked for water with lime (because I can be finicky), and when our waiter (Benjamin) came back to the table, he said that they were slicing new limes, and that he'd bring some more by in a bit. Being the cynical ass that I am, I immediately wrote that comment off as fluff, and resigned myself to having one teeny-tiny lime floating in my glass with the ice cubes. Lo and behold, not two minutes later, Benjamin comes back with a ramekin filled with lime wedges...all for me! Sometimes, it ain't so bad being wrong. =) For dinner, I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon and my husband got the shrimp tacos. It was kind of a light meal for dinner, but we were planning on sharing a Pazookie for dessert, and neither of us wanted to order a heavy meal that wouldn't leave room for dessert! The food came out relatively quickly, and I must admit, though I was initially a bit disappointed by the looks of my plate, I changed my mind as I started in on it. I mean, come on - the plate is 550 calories, so it's not going to have food dripping off the edges. There were three small salmon medallions, a small scoop of couscous and steamed veggies, and a red sauce poured over it all. It smelled divine, but looked sad. But once I started eating, I realized it wasn't sad at all. There was enough food to satiate, and the flavors were surprisingly good. Though, I will say that though I could smell the cumin in the spices, I couldn't really taste it on the fish or in the sauce. I think it just got lost with all the other flavors. My husband loved his shrimp tacos. I guess it's his ""go-to"" dish...though I question having a ""go-to"" dish at a restaurant we rarely frequent. At any rate, we did end up ordering a Pazookie: the Holiday version, and boy howdy was it delicious! The flavors of the peppermint ice cream worked really well with the rich chocolate of the Pazookie batter. It wasn't too over-powering, and one dessert was perfect to share. I will say that I was surprised by the service. Benjamin was very friendly and patient, and knowledgeable about the menu. I know he must have been busy that night, but he never made me feel rushed (I couldn't decide on a dinner entree for while!), or crazy for asking questions or the things that I ordered.

We only ordered salads & pizza but we were there for 2 hours, spending most of it waiting for everything. Food took awhile, bill took awhile. You get the picture. To give credit where it's due though, our waitress was incredibly nice. When my friends didn't like their salad (mysteriously their Caesar salad didn't taste like Caesar...) she made sure to get them a different salad of their choice (free of charge) AND had the chef in the kitchen make a whole new batch. Professional, right? Best of all, she didn't make a fuss or give us a hard time about it. I was going to give BJ's only 2 stars because of the slow service but our server was so professional I had to bump it up to 3!

Dew, I love that they have ooey gooey pizookies, I love the potato soup and the chicken alfredo baked potatoes, however, I do not love the poor service we received on the night of March 28th. We brought our friend here for her birthday. She is here from Inner Mongolia learning English, and likes to try new places. We brought her here because she wanted pizza, but we knew the menu has lots of options in case she changed her mind. I told the hostess it was this young lady's 17th birthday and she said she'd ""be sure to tell our server"". We sat for a short while before our server came up and introduced himself. He took our drink order and offered us appetizers, and as he left the table we noticed the table next to us who had been sitting since before we had, and they got his attention. They told him they had not yet been helped, to which he responded, ""I don't know who your server is, but I can help you"". To me that was a good attitude, not looking to place blame somewhere and not trying to pass the buck, but seeing an opportunity to make another tip and hopefully salvage this couple's experience. We received our drinks and ordered some appetizers and dinner. He checked on us once while we were eating the appetizers, but we didn't see him again until he brought us the bill. A nice young lady brought us our pizzas and unfortunately, our young birthday friend likes ketchup for her pizza, which we didn't know when ordering or we would have asked for it when we ordered. Anyhow, not one single person came to check on us while we were eating so she ended up eating half of her pizza but was displeased. My drink had been empty since our dinner was delivered and I was hoping for at least one refill. Our server offered us to go boxes and dessert, but we declined, because by that point there was no salvaging the night for any of us. Needless to say, the hostess did not tell the server we had a birthday girl, the server did not make sure our meal was tasty and complete, and BJ's moved from the top of our ""Let's go there for dinner tonight!"" list, to about mid-way down. The parking can be a real bear, especially on a Friday night, the wait can be long, unless the heated patio has availability, and the trouble is not really worth it when I'm paying to have dinner service but being ignored.  We are not the only ones who left disappointed that night, as the couple who was sitting next to us and had no server for a while would also attest. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess the not so strong service staff works the patio in anticipation that not many people will want to sit out there. Maybe not, but that's certainly the way it felt that night.

225,Kelly P.,"San Diego, CA",106,52,15.0,1.0,2014-08-05,"I dined here tonight after hiking cowles mtn. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken by our waiter, Matt, quite promptly. Unfortunately,  things started going downhill. Our beer and appetizer, the avocado rolls, we're delightful. My partner ordered a burger and i wanted the sirloin. We both requested them medium. When they came, his was well done and mine was medium well. Back in April this happened to my partner who ordered his steak medium and got a well done one. In April we complained to the waiter who brought the manager out and he made things right by getting him another steak. Since the issue was resolved, I did not yelp about it. This situation was handled differently. I'm not sure if it was due to how many tables Matt needed to tend to, or the lack of communication between wait staff, and management. When I told Matt about my displeasure with the food, he said he would have the manager come see us. My partner finished his meal and still no manager. So I sipped on my water and Matt tells us that the manager is in the back cooking (hmmm, could he be the one who cooked my steak?). I tell him it's okay and that we would just like the check. He ask if we want to wait because ""it will only take a few minutes"". I informed him that we may wait but we would still like the check.  The real kicker was when he turned to my partner(who is male) and tells him explicitly that ""I'll get the check for YOU"". Not you guys, just my partner, I guess the assumption is since he is male, he must be paying. It really turned me off, as it was me asking for the check the whole time, and also me who planned on paying for the food his manager overcooked, and also for the tip that I left him. At that point, I really wanted to wait for the manager, but a few minutes after we had paid and we're still not seen by the manager, it was decided we'd better just leave.  Long story short, if you want your steak/burger medium, order rare. And avoid this place unless you are okay with customer service inconsistencies. If you read my other reviews, I gloat about many establishments that I am pleased with,  but tonight BJ's wasn't one of them.

About 45 minutes later, our supper arrives, and she takes off, before we can ask her AGAIN for silverware. Luckly, we caught another server as he walked by, and he grabbed some right away. Unfortunately, our pizza was slighly doughy in the center when it arrived to our table.

142,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,4.0,2014-11-12,"I've been to this BJ's La Mesa location twice since moving to San Diego, and because I went by myself (twice), I never had to wait long. The first time, I went on ""National Pizookie Day"" to get my free Pizookie ... the second time, I just went to try the new ""S'Mores"" Pizookie that had recently debuted. Because I went in the late afternoon/early evening during both trips, I didn't have to wait long to get seated and served.  Here are my thoughts regarding the ""S'Mores"" Pizookie, as well as the classic ""Original"" and some of the other Pizookie creations I have tried thus far: ""BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores"": I have to admit, I was a bit doubtful of this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie because I don't like lots of marshmallow ... in any of my desserts. But I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with BJ's take on the classic campfire treat because THIS version featured a layer of creamy peanut butter. That's right--the BJ's twist features a Ghirardelli triple chocolate cookie (one of my favorites because it's super chocolaty) topped with a peanut butter layer and completed with marshmallow fluff that's baked to a golden finish and vanilla bean ice cream. I thought the marshmallow layer would be overwhelming and too much for me to handle, but I was wrong. I rather enjoyed the toasted marshmallow layer and was able to pair it nicely with the rich, chocolate cookie and rapidly melting ice cream. I felt that the vanilla ice cream melted quicker than usual while I was enjoying this treat, but probably because of the added heat from the torched marshmallow fluff. I very much enjoyed this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie and hope it won't leave the menu anytime soon. The peanut butter layer truly revolutionizes this treat and makes a world of difference. I think the only thing that would make this dessert even better is if graham cracker crumbs were used somehow, maybe to sprinkle the top of the Pizookie. ""Cookies 'n Cream Pizookie"": I've ordered this Pizookie once to share with a friend, and it was definitely reminiscent of OREO cookies. This creation features a rich, moist chocolate cookie that seems to be infused with OREO bits (or at least, it had a more cookies 'n cream-ish flavor). It's then topped off with three scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse. While I'm not a huge fan of mousse, this cookies 'n cream mousse wasn't too bad and the dollop was small; it didn't overwhelm or suffocate the entire dessert. I loved the OREO-like flavor of this cookie--definitely a different texture and taste from the other Pizookies--and it was just perfect when paired with the vanilla ice cream. I think the only way to make this treat even better is to actually use cookies 'n cream ice cream instead of regular vanilla.   ""BJ's Original Pizookie"": When I'm not feeling all fancy and just want a tried-and-true favorite, I just go for the ""BJ's Original Pizookie."" Though you can choose between chocolate chunk, peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia nut when it comes to the cookies, I always do a hybrid of chocolate chunk and peanut butter (you CAN do half and half). I usually just leave the vanilla ice cream alone, but you can also substitute the vanilla with chocolate, if you prefer. But really, this chocolate-peanut butter cookie medley truly brings out the best of both worlds when it comes to Pizookies.   ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"": I've ordered this dessert to share twice, and I have to admit, my first experience getting it was awesome, but the second time, this Pizookie was too salty for my liking. I would expect the dessert to have a sweet-and-salty balance, just because it DOES include salty caramel, but I think the second time I had it, someone went overboard on the salt, which makes this sort of a hit-or-miss Pizookie in my opinion and I would probably opt for one of the other sweeter varieties instead. But it features caramel cookie dough (which was very delicious), pretzel bites (great addition) and white and dark chocolate chips. Already, this Pizookie has a lot going for it, since it features many elements not present in the other Pizookies. It's topped off with caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and a Ghirardelli SQUARES dark chocolate. I'm not sure where the chefs went wrong the second time I ordered this sweet-and-salty treat, but I felt like I was biting into a salt mine. However, I'm glad that I did have a great first experience tasting this salty caramel treat. The cookie itself was great, and I enjoyed the crunch from both the pretzel bits and the white and dark chocolate chips. The ice cream paired nicely with the dish, while the salted caramel sauce added just the hint of saltiness that the sweet treat needed to make it unique.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=160,2.52,2.92,3.224,2.9600000000000004,2.7600000000000002

For starters it took 10 minutes  after we were seated for anyone to acknowledge us. Once we were finally greeted we were already ready to order. 44 minutes after they took our order our food came. My fries were missing. My gf pizza was cold like it was sitting out for a solid 20 minutes. The server knew somewhere along the line a worker messed up firing our order and he messed up not putting my fries on the order so he told a manager to come talk to us. So I'm thinking, here comes the time to save us as customers and split the bill with us (which was only $34) and he goes ""I heard your pizza was cold and it took a really long time to get your food. So I'm going to take the pizza off the bill. You have a good night"" and walked off. Awesome. Not.

475,Savannah S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2015-01-08,"Had the absolute worst experience here last Wednesday night. Mind you, a friend and I came in around 10 on a Wednesday night which is usually pretty late but we had just gotten off of work and were hungry. We got greeted by a host right away and asked if we were wanting to sit in the dining area or the bar area since it was happy hour. We decided to sit in the bar area with probably one or two other tables. Before sitting down I walked to the restroom and noticed there was hardly anyone in the dining area as well. After about 10 minutes of waiting we were introduced to our server (really wish I would have remembered his name) and he took our drink orders. Our drinks arrived promptly and although we were ready to order, he rushed away quickly and was not to be seen for another 15 minutes. When he finally arrived back he asked if we were ready and we ordered. My friend and I both ordered a side wedge salad (with a side of balsamic vinegarette and asked if we could have the salad chopped in the back, which they usually do without a problem) , nachos which were on the happy hour menu, and a medium pizza with pesto, sundried tomatoes, garlic and basil. About another 15 minutes went by and another waiter dropped off our salads. They were not chopped and we didn't receive any balsamic vinegeratte as well. It took about 10 more minutes to find someone (not our waiter who was nowhere to be seen) and asked if we could have a side of dressing and some silverware. He brought them quickly and we began eating the salads. Five more minutes passed by and the same guy dropped off our nachos. They were NOT appetizing at all, it was mostly more of a bean dip and after two or three bites we both gave up and decided to just wait for the pizza. Another 15 minutes later... our pizza arrived and we noticed that instead of basil and sundried tomatoes, they instead put pepperoncinis and artichoke hearts. Luckily, being as hungry as we both were we ignored the fact and dug in. The pizza was probably the highlight of that dinner because it all went downhill from there...  After noticing we were finished, the waiter came back and asked if we were finished and if we wanted to place a dessert. Wanting to get out of there as soon as possible we simply asked for the check. ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by and he drops it off to our table. It came out to be 30 something dollars and I put down a $100 dollar bill. A few minutes later he comes by and says he would be right back with some change. He then drops off the change and tells us to have a good night. By this time, my friend just nodded her head in annoyance to the extremely poor service we had just recieved.. and as I'm counting my money back to myself I realized the change he gave me was short 7 dollars. I could not find the server again for the next 10 minutes so I asked the busboy if he could get him for me. The waiter then comes and says word for word ""okay guys what did I f*** up on now"". By this moment I should have asked to speak to a manager but I was so annoyed and in a rush to leave I just explained to him that he gave me the wrong amount of change back and that he owed me 7 dollars. He then began to tell me that I was wrong and to check it again. He went back and forth from the computer checking the math and then realized that he had ""accidently"" added something to our ticket that was meant for another table. He apologized and said ""so what I owe you like another 5 dollars"". I am in such disbelief that any establishment would allow their employees to be giving this type of service, which seems to be a regular thing as I have read most of the other reviews on here. I myself am a server at a restaurant, and have been for the last 7 years and have never seen anything like this nor would I give any customers a reason to leave me anything less of a 5 star review on yelp.

Well now it's been 45 minutes and our food still hasn't come out. Food comes and we have to send a plate back for the taste being so awful. We ordered a desert and it came but they only brought 2 spoons for 7 people. Had to ask a bus boy for more spoons bc we couldn't find our waitress (again). Spoons that were brought were wet and covered in grey goo. By the end of everything we talked over how awful it was and realized we were never even offered refills on our drinks!

We decided we wanted to get some apps so we let one of our servers know and said that we would have separate checks. She informed me that because she had entered drinks that she couldn't separate anything. As someone who served for several years I knew that that was untrue. (If this is how BJs systems operate then some upgrades are severely needed!) She also told me that I did not indicate multiple checks when I made the reservation. I let her know that I was not asked our preference. In the end, we ended up writing our checks out individually ourselves and she divided them up on the computer. It took her an hour of our time to do so. I think the manner in which she handled this was very unprofessional.

349,Blair C.,"San Diego, CA",151,61,130.0,4.0,2015-02-09,"We had dinner there this evening and it was seriously wonderfully delicious. I had the chicken bacon ranch pizza which is always to die for. My boyfriend had the New York steak with cheddar mash potatoes and clam chowder. He wasn't very stoked with the mash potatoes or the soup. He said they were both very basic and bland, with the potatoes being a little on the cold side. But he thoroughly enjoyed the steak saying it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. We also got the Santa Fe spring rolls which were good but not the most amazing ones we've ever had. Cheesecake Factory does them much better. These were fairly basic, small with a good taste but nothing to die for. But the main reason I always come to BJ's is for their amazing deep dish pizza which is always the best and their amazing selection of craft beers. Their seasonal double IPA on tap right now is pretty superb. Besides all the food one of my favorite parts of the experience was the service. Our waiter was so friendly and attentive! He was constantly there when we needed him and even when we didn't. He knew all the beers very well and was able to recommend a few beers to both my boyfriend and I based on what kind of beers we normally drink and let us taste them to choose. And my favorite part, the pizookie!!! Delicious and perfect no matter what BJ's you go to:) I loved it!!!

Every time he's helped us out, he's been the only server in that section and has still done above and beyond.  Of course with that many tables, there's gonna be a bit of a wait. Trevor does the best he can with his time- takes our order, drinks come out right after, food comes out in a decent time, checks up on you multiple times and still waiting on ten other tables at the same time.

After seating us, I  immediately asked to move as we were seated next to two swinging doors that the employees use to enter & exit the from the dining room to the kitchen. After moving, we got two cold beers & ordered dinner. However, the waitress couldn't multi task or  organize herself to handle more than one table at a time after she got a few more tables. At this point, we barely saw her. Someone else served our dinner which came out quickly & tasted good!!!! After the dinners were brought out, my husband immediately signaled for the waitress since his beer glass was empty.  The waitress kept rushing by empty handed but kept putting her finger up saying she needed a minute. We did finally flag her down & corner her but she never brought the 2nd beer my husband ordered due to the fact that she said the keg was getting changed. By then, my husband's meal was long gone. Interesting enough, the busboy never picked up our empty plates. He walked by often enough but only seemed focused on clearing & setting empty tables. Our dishes stayed until the end of the meal when the bill arrived. The waitress came over & said she felt bad & offered to take off my husband's first beer, which never happened. We paid the check up at the hostess stand as we were tired of waiting for her & spoke to the manager. Just thought he'd want to know....NOT THE CASE. He apologized  robotically & stared at us.

Two nice size pieces of deboned chicken breast, lightly breaded, seasoned very well with shaved Parmesan and a wonderful lemony buttery sauce on it. Still delish. I am a saucy girl, so I asked for a little extra sauce on the side to dip my broccoli and mashed potatoes in. Broccoli cooked perfectly and comes pretty plain, so the sauce was a good dipper. Their potatoes though.....so dense and not a lot of flavor. I do remember them like this and I wonder why they can't make a lighter version, would be SO much more appealing.

Our service is often great, but our waitress (Gabriela) decided to go AWOL and we did not see her until she brought out check.

356,Paula C.,"Santee, CA",0,5,,1.0,2015-06-21,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Last night, my family and I got take-out BBQ chicken salads and a pizookie which both were very unsatisfactory. The salads consisted of old lettuce, corn, and a few pieces of dry chicken which is 3 of the 8 things the salad was supposed to have on it. The pizookie was very hard and looked like it had been sitting for a few hours.  We then returned to BJs for a refund or remake of our food and were treated horribly by the young girl at the take-out counter. It then took about 10 minutes for the manager, Ryan, to come out to remedy the situation. Ryan was very rude and did not apologize for our experience. We decided to get a refund after he said it would take 20 minutes to prepare two salads and a pizookie. He did not seem willing to refund us, but after an ""I guess we can do that"", he took about 10 minutes to find our order on the computer and give us our money back. We tried giving our unappealing food back to the young girl at the take-out counter, but she replied while looking down and chewing her gum, ""nope, you can keep it"".  Overall, BJ's service has greatly declined and I can say without hesitation that they have lost our business. Both Ryan and the girl in takeout were very rude and were not apologetic in the least.  I would not recommend going to this location let alone this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=320,3.16,2.99,3.136,2.6280000000000006,3.0580000000000007

259,Trish C.,"Lakeside, CA",0,4,2.0,1.0,2015-06-23,"Food was decent... Crappy service. Shame on waitress Carla for her behavior; shame on manager Ryan for allowing it.  My husband and I went to BJ's at Grossmont for an early dinner last Friday night. It was crowded but we got seated fairly quickly.  On our table was a card advertising happy hour specials. We checked the time, we were within the time frame, so we decided to order drinks off of that menu. To be clear, the happy menu was on our table in the dining area, and there was nothing on the card stating that that menu or those prices were only available in the bar area. It took a while for the waitress, Carla, to actually make an appearance at our table. When we tried to order off the happy hour menu, she said we could only get that menu/those prices at the bar. The difference in prices for the drinks we wanted on the happy hour menu versus the regular menu was about $10. I asked Carla if there was any reason we couldn't order our food through her off the regular menu, but get our drinks ourselves at the bar. She said we could do it, but clearly did not like that idea.  And here's where our experience at BJ's turned bad - After my husband went to get our drinks, Carla, the waitress, pretty much stopped waiting on our table to the point of rudeness.  When my salad arrived, the silverware set at my seat was dirty - I mean the fork was crusty-dirty, it should never have been wrapped up. This was not her fault, of course (unless she rolled the silverware) but it was her job to replace it once it was pointed out to her.  It took me a while to get her attention to the point she would come over to the table. I finally flagged her down and asked her for clean silverware. Not only did she NOT apologize for the dirty silverware, she left me sitting there for several minutes with my salad in front of me and no way to eat it - all while she went to other tables in the section, smiling, chatting with other tables, other customers. Me, not so much. Without slowing down, she finally scooped up the dirty set without stopping, on her way to somewhere/someone else, and several minutes later, dropped ( and I do mean ""drop"") off a new set, again on her way to someone/somewhere else - all without pausing, all without a word. It was obvious at this point that she was punishing us for getting our own drinks.  The food was brought by the expediter. Carla never once checked back at our table. She avoided our gaze, never made eye contact, never stopped to ask or inquire if everything was OK or if we needed anything else. She would avert her eyes when walking past our table. I am not kidding or exaggerating, I wish I were. She was that rude and nasty. Meanwhile, she was smiling and seemingly happily waiting on every other table in her section. The difference in service between our table and the other tables was very noticeable.  At the end of our meal, after we had been sitting there for some time with empty plates in front of us. She finally came up and without looking at me, addressed my husband and asked if we wanted our plates cleared away. And when she brought the bill, she again addressed him, ignoring me, and gave him the bill. I picked up the bill, put my card into the folder and set it down on my side of the table. She picked it up with out a word, and when she returned it for signature, she AGAIN placed it on his side of the table, ignoring me, not making eye contact with me, not speaking to me.  She never thanked us, never said any pleasantries, nothing. IMO, with that attitude, she had no business waiting tables in a sit down restaurant.  Before leaving I stopped and spoke to Ryan, the manager. And, although he apologized for the bad service, and even said that it wasn't a big deal to order off the happy hour menu in the dining room, I felt at the very least we should have been offered something, some kind of compensation, but that didn't happen.  Carla, it was obviously your intention to give us bad service and to negatively impact our meal and our night - and you succeeded, so good for you. Do you feel better now? And shame on manager Ryan for allowing this kind of service in his restaurant. If it happened to us, I'm sure it has happened to other customers as well. Shame on both of you. You're in the service industry, have some pride. I'm not quite sure what number of stars to rate this place, as the food was decent, but the service we received was really awful and rude - how does that translate in stars?

I know, that sounds blasphemous considering how DELICIOUS they are ...but we're trying to lose 5 pounds....

They are crunchy to the right amount, and I love the seasoning here. They have new flavors for the dry wings, and they ALL tastes great. Everyone needs to check 'em out!!  I docked one star because the service at this restaurant is never consistent. We've had some of the crappiest waiters, and some of the best as well.

Based on a few experiences at this location years ago, likely would have rated ~4 stars for price, food quality, customer service, and overall value. Unfortunately, this was a BJ's experience unlike any other I've had. Arrived at ~8:10pm this last Monday night, and was promptly seated; It was not a busy Monday night. Drink orders went fine and delivered in reasonable time. Entrees were ordered by ~8:20pm. A little after 9pm, began to be concerned regarding where the food was, especially considered the restaurant was largely vacant. Food arrived a couple minutes after complaining. My friend and I had both ordered the Mahi Mahi taco plate, and substituted one of the two fish tacos with a shrimp taco. Seconds after my friend had bit into her fish taco, she exclaimed ""this fish as BAD!"" Having worked in a high-end seafood restaurant for years, I was unwilling to take her word and took a bite of my own fish taco. Yep, it was bad alright. RANCID, would be the correct term for this spoiled, not to mention cold, fish. This review would be a solid 1 star had it not been for BJ's management offering to purchase a replacement meal. Because if was 9:20pm at this point, I declined and received a gift card for future use. Based on that I debated between giving 2 or 3 stars, but as Yelp describes 2 as ""Meh.

We didn't have to wait too long for our foodies to come out and our server was still good on trying to keep everyone's drinks filled.

The last time i have ordered sliders with extra cheddar and onion and 2 jambalaya no sausage  The sliders  has no onions and the cheese looks sad and covered less than quarter of the slider.  The jambalaya it has sausage  when i called they put me on hold for long time. The manager spokes to me saying that the sausage its 100% chicken it's not pork.

La Mesa's BJ's is located within the busy Grossmont Plaza. The parking lot is huge but parking can be hard to find at lunch hours as there are so many stores in this center. Ordering to go is a snap with their online system. I've dined in as well as ordered online for togo. The restaurant is big with multiple seating options so large parties can celebrate here. Service is prompt and efficient. The staff has always been friendly and welcoming. The menu is huge with many options to satisfy various cravings. Healthy eaters will be delighted by the enlightened menu with entrees scaled down in calories. Portion size for those entrees are run a little smaller on average. On this recent lunch trip, I ordered a bison burger meal that came with a side of my choice. I had the bison meat cooked medium rare and opted for grilled asparagus. The burger was delicious. The bison patty was cooked a bit over medium rare though. I enjoyed it but would have liked it more if it was right at medium rare or a bit under. The portion size was filling and could have passed for dinner as well. The price for this meal was very good at 11.50. You would be hard pressed to find a bison burger meal with a side at sitdown restaurants for that price.  5 stars BJ. Good food, good price, good service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=140,2.84,3.23,3.08,2.7399999999999998,3.074

The drink was 7.25 and I was charged 8.50 for an extra shot. If I knew it cost more to make it a double I would have just had 2 separate drinks. I asked the bartender about it, she was very pleasant and had it changed to the price of 2 regular drinks. But again I would have liked to try a different flavor drink if I knew it was going to be the same price. The price was not on the menu and I guess I should have asked about the price but I didn't want to be that cheap ass / I'm a bartender and from my experience it has been cheaper to get a double than order 2 drinks. Maybe if you don't offer a double price you should tell the customer when they order.

They also have my favorite GF beer, Omission as well as as the BJ's berry cider and another pear cider. My husband and I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup, caesar salad and a GF pizza to share. Our friends' ordered the wedge salad, sriracha mac and cheese and the grilled salmon with rice and asparagus.  The salads were both good. The lettuce was crisp with not too much dressing. The soup was terrible. It got cold really fast so it was thick and goopy and I couldn't eat it anymore. My friend loved her sriracha mac and cheese. I wish they had a GF pasta option so I could try it! Her bf loved the salmon too but thought his asparagus was weird because it was really skinny and soft. Our GF pizza was just okay. It definitely was not the best GF pizza I've ever had. I've honestly had better GF pizza from Dominos. The crust was too thin and hard and the toppings just fell off the crust every where.

Then it took thirty minutes to get someone's attention just so we can order drinks. I repeat FOR DRINKS. And all I wanted was water because I was so thirsty from our previous time at the beach.  Then when we ordered food our waitress corrected my husband twice in a condescending tone and as soon as she went to me she asked if I wanted to be skipped as soon as I was going to talk because she was rushing. When my soup came out it wasn't even warm!! Good but come on who likes cold soup. And by the time we got our entree we were so hungry and as soon as we start to dig in we realized none of us have silverware and napkins!!! And of course our waitress was gone. The manager was nice enough to knock off 25% off our bill and throw in two free pizookies but it honestly should of been completely  free. I mean if we're willing to pay $17 a plate which I could make in the comfort of my own home for way less then I don't expect to get worse service than a fast food restaurant. And when we ordered the pizookies we asked if she could bring spoons since our silverware doesn't come with them and we said it all nice and then of course in a rude tone she was like it comes with it so do you want extra silverware? I was all nice and said no but in my head I was thinking well she must think pastas and spaghettis are finger foods because we didn't get silverware for that until we asked. And when we told her about the pizookies being free for us she said again in a rude tone really? Because he didn't tell me that. So we were like just go talk to him because we were so fed up with her. And she was like I will. Of course she came out all like I'm sorry he didn't tell me. Then the pizookies were cold!!! I only had pizookies at the BJ'S in LA but every time I got a pizookie (which is a lot) it was fresh and so warm that when you take a piece of the cookie the chocolate chips were melted and gooey. If your reading this I'm sorry it's so long but if you think about it, if my post is this long that means to many things went wrong. I'm sure not all the staff is like this but this was our experience and that one waitress honestly ruined BJ'S for me and I've been going there for years.

This is not my restaurant of choice to be honest, my son likes it here.  I'm not a fan of their pizza. I think it's way too doughy, the sauce is too sweet, and it lacks flavor. If we come here I usually order soup or salad. Don't shoot me, but I also do not get the hoopla over the famed pizookie either. It's way too sweet. To me it kind of tastes a little disgusting. I'd rather go out for gelato.  I think I prefer coming here during lunch. It's way too noisy at dinner time. I mean seriously noisy, and the drinkers get obnoxiously loud. I don't care to hear their opinions on sports or women's breast sizes shouted into my ear while I'm trying to eat. Especially if they're commenting on my server.

Our mishaps started a few weeks ago I placed 3 orders to go, I got home and one order was missing, drove back and it was STILL the wrong order.. (You may be asking why didn't I check before I left the 2nd time, well the order was for some kind of deep dish lasagna and I got some other red cheesy pasta which looked like lasagna until you but into it). The manager gave us a gift card for 30 dollars for our mishap.. GREAT!!  TONIGHT: i decide to put my gift card to use.. Placed another order to go.. This time i checked everything!!! Bacon and cheese on burgeR .. 2 orders of fries .. 3 main dishes .. I just glanced at the ice cream that came with the pazooki through the lid to make sure it was chocolate and not vanilla (which is my fav dessert of all time) ... Everything is great at home until I eat the ice cream.. First there was a small piece of plastic in one spoonful, I just shook my head and disregarded it cause shit happens I guess (that's the understanding side) but as I kept eating a HUGE PIECE OF PLASTIC WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ice cream.. At this point I'm disgusted.. This is a huge safety issue for small children.. Thank god this happened to me and not a child..  I will not be revisiting this location..

T-I-N-A."" She asked the name again, so I said and spelled it a second time. She verified the number as 4, we bid each other farewell and hung up.  1) We show up and check in for our res at 7:20, and are told we would have to wait 25-30 minutes. The whole point of making a reservation is so that you don't have to wait more than 5 (10, if I'm being gracious) minutes for a table.  2) They could not find my reservation on their computer. The gal said there was a res under the name of Lisa for 14 people, and that someone must have misunderstood me on the phone. I spelled my name out twice. We verified the party count twice. That is not a misunderstanding. That is incompetence.  3) The manager sat us and apologized. He claimed they were under staffed, yet I saw at least 10 wait staff, plus the 3 that were constantly on their personal cell phones.  4) The other couple we were with ordered a buffalo chicken pizza. It came out as a BBQ chicken pizza. Thank God none of us are allergic to anything in BBQ sauce. My shrimp pasta had 4 shrimp on it. I've paid less for shrimp and gotten more. I was also brought the wrong wine. 5) No compensation of any kind was offered after this nightmare date. Initially we had asked for two checks, 1 for each couple.

Took at least an hour to get our food and another hour before we could flag down our server, who in the mean time sat down with a couple dining to chat for awhile, to bring us our check.

But this passed Friday we went to celebrate our friends bday, I called in advance because we were a very large party (18 people). They made the reservations no problem, we arrived alittle early just so we all were ready when they called us that our table was ready. Our Reservation was at 830, I went in about 8:15 or so just to let them know we were here just hanging out outside so they didnt think we didnt show up.  I knew we were a large party so I was not stressing on them seating us at EXACTLY 830 but roughly around it would have been nice. 8:45 rolls around i go inside and just ask what the status was on our table. one of the hostess informed me that they were just setting up the table for us. and she would come on out and get us as soon as they were done. Few minutes went by and they came and got us.  Sat down, and a waitress immediately started taking our drink orders. I thought wow thats awesome. After taking our drinks it took her FOREVER to bring us the drinks,and when she did some of the sodas were watered down almost like they were served and sat ona counter for a bit before she brought them to our table. I get it its one of her 18 of us. But i mean dont they know how to pace their time? this is what she does for a living? we couldnt have been her first LARGE party table before. Ask for help? I say this only because the resturant by this time was not busy  where i dont know why she didnt get help.  There was a bus boy which i wish i remembered his name seemed to be the one helping us with our needs because our waitress was no where to be found. he came and removed plates, gave us refills. at one point we asked out waitress several times for Napkins and silverware there were NONE on the table. when we sat down. then some other girl heard that we needed silverware and started to bring some over. I guess she ran out and said she would be back with more. She disappeared also, and when i seen her standing near our table she was on her phone.  all in all, the food was great but the service was the worst i have every experienced before.

I'd say we average eating here 25 times a year and we've always had great food and great service, with a few exceptions throughout the years(it happens). Tonight we had a play at the kids school that didn't end until 8 so we decided to use curbside pickup for the first time. Order was supposed to be ready at 8:15, we arrived at 8:10 and called to let them know we had arrived and to pay so we could get the kids home, fed and in bed(they're 6 months, 7 & 9 years old). They didn't come out to take the card until 8:20 and said the food will be right out. 8:35 rolls around and the guy comes out with just our card, no food, and says they messed up the kids cheese pizza(didn't put cheese on it?), he said we took those off the bill and the food will be right out. 8:45 he brings the food and we head home. When we get home I noticed my pizza was missing the garlic and cilantro and my wife's baked potato had no topping on the side. No sour cream, butter, cheese or anything.... and of course the only meals that were hot was the kids pizzas. Very disappointing having to microwave our meals after sitting in the car waiting for 35 minutes with a baby screaming and daughter crying because she's hungry and tired. Overall very disappointed with the curbside experience. Will it stop us from coming back?

101,Peter M.,"El Cajon, CA",107,3,,1.0,2016-11-20,"Im not one to complain...ever, but tonight we experienced the worst service i have ever had at a restaurant. And a corporate restaurant where money is spent to properly train each worker rather than just throw them on the floor and see how they work out!.. My wife, her friend,husband and child and I chose Bjs in La Mesa and once we walked in the door around 10 p.m we were greeted and seated very generously by the hostess. Then took our server about 8 minutes to finally greet us and take our drink order. Then it took about 10 minutes to receive half our drinks and not even the child drink yet ,the child drink and the rest of our drinks came another 4 minutes after that! Again we came in at 10 p.m and restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of servers on the floor since Bjs is open till 1 a.m. We ordered an app and our food, then that was the last we seen of our server..(till later on in the story). 10 min later our app comes,by expo.(ok timing) 20 min later again only half of our dinners came,by expo...then finally another 15 minutes the other half of our dinners come,by expo and since the first half waited to eat till the rest came ,their food was cold.. And none of us at the table have complained or asked why the time issues and where is our server yet, we were just trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and think maybe there is something happening we dont know about that is causing them to have food time and or server issues. By this time our drinks are empty and we have dirty plates crowding the table from the app. about 10 minutes after we are trying to eat our cold dinner without any condiments cause we havent been checked on and no drinks to wash anything down..we see a HUGE party, 35+ people walk in and before i knew for sure everybody would be busy i finally get up and seek a manager and simply ask for assistance at our table. And at this time i see our server walk out from the back and go straight to the party. So a manager and another server come prebus our table and just bring the condiments we needed 20+ minutes and about 6 more glasses of waters and tea that instead needed to just be  ""re-filled""..so now we have more stuff crowding our table again. Then didnt see the manager or any server for about another 25 min. Finally the ""expo"" comes and takes our plates and the manager comes and ask for any more drink refills from the bar, seriously? Way too late now! But friends husband orders a dessert and gets that brought out in about 12 minutes. Finally we get our check..from our original server!?!.and 1 check! when we asked in the very beginning to please split only 2 ways and he even took the order split in his notepad. So i wait 7 min for him to come back and ask him to fix it. But he never comes back so i get up and ask the manager to check me out and i mention that it was supposed to be split but im just going to pay the whole bill so we can leave now and specifically not to split it anymore. I go back to my table and then the original server walks up to the manager and has her split the checks and brings them back to me. Then i got a lil angry and told him i told the manager not split it and just run my card for the whole bill..he already ran it for half!!! So now he goes back and runs it again for a  second time for the other half of the bill!!! Then he proceeds to stay at the table and explain there was nothing he could do to of been of more help to us cause he was busy with the HUGE party! Then i got a lil more angry and said who was in charge of assigning the party to you and not assigning another server to take over our table? He said the manager but there was still nothing he could of done. Are you kidding me? We paid the full bill a lil over $100. We didnt even ask for any comps..we didnt even get an apology.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=120,3.0,2.95,3.088,2.02,2.9700000000000006

He apologized and our food was brought to us shortly after that. He explained that the kitchen was cray and we were understanding.

BJ's was one of the restaurants participating in the Veteran's Day specials, so I went to this location with my sister and brother-in-law because the wait for the Chula Vista location was too long.  The Vet's special at BJ's was a free entree (for up to $12.95) and a free beer. My bro-in-law got a deep dish pizza and was going to pay the difference, my sister got a flatbread, and I got a burger. The food took a really, really long time to get to us. We waited patiently, and we understood how busy it was, but our waiter didn't really check up on us. Other people got their food before us, as well. Not to mention, our waiter took a long time to get us our waters, and forget to give us our lemons despite us asking several times. He even had the chance when he gave us our appetizer, but forgot. The food was delicious, and we were all very satisfied. The main problem was the customer service. Davis was our server, and not only did he not check on us a lot, he messed up on the bill multiple times. He failed to do the Vet's special (for the entree and the beer), so we had to remind him. Also, he didn't make one of the beers free. Then it was the wrong entree that he took the money off of.  There were multiple mistakes, but after having him fix it (and take long to pick up the check), we just let it be. Another note! When we called the Chula BJ's location, the person who answered the phone was sweet and you could hear the smile in her voice. Whereas when calling the Grossmont BJ's location, the girl who answered sounded rude and impatient. Although it's busy, customer service is still a thing.

We ordered a classic deep dish pizza, only the 9 inch since deep dish is denser and more filling.  I understand that deep dish usually takes longer to cook so we were prepared to wait. When it arrived 40 minutes later I was disappointed because after all that time the look and taste was comparable to a frozen DiGiorno pizza. Nothing like any true deep dish I've ever tasted. We decided to order a mint chocolate pizookie which tasted good but in my opinion overpriced. Basically $7.50 for a cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  I guess it's the novelty of it.

He checked in on us to make sure we were doing well and that my kids had everything that they needed. He even asked if we wanted our kids food right away or if we wanted it made shortly before our meals so their meals had time to cool down before coming to the table. He was so sweet, funny, sincere, and all around an awesome server. These days, in all fields of work, people lack customer service skills, but not Nathan. People are too quick to complain when they receive bad service, but don't take the time to give praise when they receive great service.

I asked to speak with the manager her name was Nastasia  she was very rude passed me twice and pretended not to see me until I got another waitress to get her for me she seem frazzled, annoyed, irritated, could care less,I explained I am a regular customer who comes often here with my family and I was surprised that there salads were so small for amount we payed for them and if I knew they had changed the portion I would never had ordered them. She blamed corporate for the change and removed only 2 out of 5 and walked away I just felt she should have removed all of them and at that point the next time I come I would not order them anymore. But I will say the waiter Toby was a sweet and patient and very helpful with us with our order and when he went on break Summer took over and she was also sweet and very caring to finish us up.

92,Chris A.,"Bonita, CA",123,63,8.0,2.0,2017-03-11,"Where to begin...I would have just written this off as a bad experience that was a serious comedy of errors by the staff of the restaurant, but I noticed that many other customers also had similar complaints  So what's the problem? Leadership and training.  From the beginning of the ""call ahead"" where we were told there was a 50 minute wait from the time of our call (turned out to be an hour and a half). Prior proper planning prevents poor performance.  The fact is that they didn't have a table and it appears that in an effort to prevent walkways  they give a time that they cannot live up to.. I knew there was a problem when the hostess told me that they were trying to get a table from outside to put one together for our group..finally we were given a choice of a booth for our group of 7 or wait around until a table became available. Having waited for so long my wife wanted to take the table (I ended sitting in a chair in the isle. So they are trying right? While I appreciate effort from the hostess (they were embarrassed) it got worse.  As we were sitting at the table my wife slipped and fell on the floor.  In an effort to turn over the tables quickly they did not clean up properly. Again this  is not  an anomaly, other patrons have complained about the same situation. The floor was wet and greasy.  While the effort was made to clean it up the experience at this restaurant was just going from bad to worse. So we make our order and we wait again. So...food on a busy night one should expect some additional wait time.. no big deal, but when it comes it should be hot and ready to eat. My wife's Pizza was barely warm and so I asked them to warm it up. They took the pizza and we waited again...10 minutes...15 minutes...20 minutes and finally the pizza. The young woman tells us that they dropped our other Pizza and had to remake it. No one came to tell us and so we waited. By now half of our party was done with food and we were staring at a large Pizza and we had had enough. The only reason I gave 2 stars was that the manager or supervisor came by and apologized and gave us a gift card for all the mistakes. In summary, the restaurant does not have bad food not great but it's what you expect when you go out to a chain establishment. But even a chain establishment should be organized in such a manner that they should be prepared for this type volume of service. Training, training, training. As a business owner and a manager of service personnel I would say that there is a deficiency in the area of organizational management at this establishment. The other reviews appear to back this up. Whomever has the opportunity to read and consider these reviews should rethink their training program.

Food came, wrong fries , plus they were room temperature. Waitress took my drink away with still about 1/3 left. Took 5 minutes to get a replacement. This is not typical bjs service . . .

My point of view I don't know why we had to wait to get our table. It wasn't as busy yet.  After awhile once we sat down we all orders our drinks. I'd order dr. Pepper, once we got our drinks I had a sip of it. I realize it wasn't dr.pepper, I made my hubby try it and he said it was a diet drink so then I waited for the waitress to come back and tell her. They finally got the right drink. We all notice at the table there were no utensils at the table. They finally provided us the utensil before the food arrive.  My hubby utensils was dirty which had food still stuck on the forks and knives. My sister in law, mother in law ordered some type of salad which had no dressing on it. We all asked if she wanted dressing but she didn't want to fuss about it, so she said no.  The waitress were next to non existence throughout our time there.  At the end of the meal I asked for my drink in a Togo cup she never brought it to me, so I was like whatever. That was the worst customer service I ever had there. The waitress name was Paige b. So I finally saw my email which showed a response to my review that I posted. I read it and the manager Braxton wrote back, saying  he wanted to talk to me. So I decided to call him back and see what he wanted to say to me. He said he apologized for what happened, and wanted my feedback to improve the restaurant for the near future.  I was surprised what he gave me because I told him it wasn't just me that was in the party.  He gave a good amount of gift cards. I provided him my email address so that he can email me the gift cards.

Well on Tuesday, i tried to order some and after being on hold for 10 minutes, the lady said she couldn't sell me just the rolls. I didn't understand why because i had literally purchased them the night before and money wasn't the issue. Hell, i would have paid 10$ for a half dozen. That's over a dollar for each roll.  I am pregnant, and anyone who knows anything about pregnant cravings know when you want something, that's just what you want ! well yesterday, Wednesday, my husband called in and tried to order them again, because that's all that i want, and after crying on Tuesday because of the fact that this damn place denied to sell them to me, an employee by the name of ARIA J, was able to inform me, that they offered 4 rolls and marinara sauce for $4.95. I was very close to literally never ever eating here again, and i was going to do a horrible review because i am an emotional pregnant woman who was refused some rolls. lol But Aria made it better for me. Because of her, i will continue to eat here, and i will make sure next time i order rolls, they honor it for me.

One person in our party received the wrong order then had to cancel it because it took so long to come out. Waitress was nice enough to deduct the plate and wrap it up.

After standing around like morons for far too long, we asked again about our wait and were told that we were not on the list... The front door staff got us seated shortly after, so, ok... Then after waiting for what now seemed like eternity, I finally got up and stopped one of the waitresses that were doing their best to skirt our table and asked if she could find who our server was. She reluctantly said that ""apparently she would be our waitress..."". Again, ok. Our food was all pretty simple: burgers, fries, salads, pizza, etc. after 45 minutes and the last of my hair falling out, a different server brought our meals. The burgers seemed to be the hold up, because they were pretty fresh. Everything else had obviously been waiting for the burgers, because it all pretty much sucked...

Basically, that's the equivalent of Biggie vs. Tupac of the serving world. I hope they can work it out because their rivalry, while entertaining, interfered with a family celebration and made it awkward.  And to add insult to injury, the bathroom isn't clean?! Nah. That's just nasty. Almost EVERY surface was wet. They tried to make it up to us by giving us free dessert. And guess what?! They even brought that out late. Free is too high a price at this BJ's.

Each month this pizza is delicious, and the ever- rotating pizookie flavor is more delicious than the last. Though we must admit- the monkey bread is probably one of the best desserts we've ever had!

I wanted to take advantage of the happy hour menu but it turned out that we had to sit by the bar to take advantage of that.  Our server showed us the daily specials and today, Wednesday, the special was loaded burgers with unlimited fries.  We ordered the portobello Swiss, hickory brisket bacon, guacamole deluxe on a veggie patty (yes! vegetarian burgers were also an option) and a couple bacon cheeseburgers.  There was no need for extra fries because our meals very very filling. As busy as the place was, our server made sure we had our glasses refilled when needed and checked if we were enjoying our food.  Today was also one free pizookie per table day.  Oh, how I missed this dessert.  The warm gooey goodness of chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream did not disappoint.  We also ordered the white chocolate pizookie.  I have to admit, that was clever marketing I saw on Facebook.  I'm such a sucker for free food ads. That was the main reason I came here.  However, I was hoping to save a little bit more money by also taking advantage of the happy hour menu.  Nevertheless, we still enjoyed our meals.

Here's the lowdown about BJ's La Mesa; The stores GM, Braxton is truly fabulous.  He genuinely cares about the customers and the restaurant.  I have no doubt he's doing his best with what he's got to work with.  Also, the food (when and if you get it) is usually pretty decent.  We've had a few bad servers once in awhile and some messed up orders here and there, but the real complaint is with ""that"" woman manager.  Why and how she still has a job in the hospitality industry is puzzling.  We have seen her put her fingers in food, throw her servers under the bus, treat busboys horribly, had her been rude to us, make unprofessional comments, ignore guest requests and more.   I haven't taken the time to write a review because some of the experiences we've had are just unreal and I didn't feel it was worth my time.  I'm only writing now because it's my last straw and this latest fiasco didn't even involve us.   So the man and woman seated next to us apparently had cold, not great food.  They let their waitress know and were both very nice about it.  Waitress was super nice, promptly apologized, offered to replace their food and was letting the manager know.  It took 10-15 minutes and guess who comes out?  Yep-""that"" manager.  The guests explained the problem with the food to her and added a nice compliment about their waitress.  Manager spent all of one minute speaking with them in a not friendly tone whatsoever, offered ZERO apology, completely ignored the kind words about her wait staff and simply said she would take it off the bill and walked away.  Even with our past experience, our jaws hit the floor.  I turned to look at our neighbors who just looked dumbfounded.  It took another 10-15 minutes for them to receive their check.   Having ""that"" manager treat us regulars crappy is one thing-but it was entirely different seeing it happen to someone else.  We will be calling ahead to make sure she's not working before going back.  Pretty sad from a group that used to visit 1-3 times a week.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=40,3.16,3.06,3.152,2.8880000000000003,3.1000000000000005

We took bites of the salad while waiting for soy sauce for the Ahi, the salad was very good HOWEVER the Seared Ahi was still frozen!!! Really???? It tasted hard, ice still on it and extremely fishy. The Runner ended up finding some soy sauce in the back, but when he came back to the table we asked to have the manager come over to speak with us.

Once the salad arrived I took a few bites and it was just drenched with dressing so I had to be that annoying customer that asks for a new one with dressing on the side and you could tell that the server was irritated. I received my new salad and after that she wouldn't make eye contact with me.  But I got my ribs and they were to die for! And it was a Tuesday so the pazookie was only $3!!!

I'll go back for the food but not the service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa,3.44,3.27,3.168,,3.338
8,Charles C.,"La Mesa, CA",54,200,772.0,3.0,2017-11-02,"Corporate owned and managed restaurants are pervasive in San Diego and elsewhere, and they can have a value when you seek the experience they offer. That value is usually one of consistency, of meeting expectations. You know what you will get and what you will NOT get.  All I wanted was to sit quietly at a large booth in an uncrowded room, sip white wine and nibble on something familiar. No challenges or unnecessary interactions.  I was intending to attend the 5:30 p.m. All Saints Day Mass at Our Lady of Grace Roman Catholic Church in El Cajon on Tuesday, so I wanted to eat at 3:30 p.m. in the area.  I knew BJ's Restaurant [where I have been before] was just down Fletcher Parkway from the Church at Grossmont Center, so I decided to eat there. It was very quiet when I entered BJ's at 3:30 p.m. The cheerful hostess greeted me immediately, and led me to a large, semi-circular booth, as I had requested [there are only five such booths in the restaurant---ask for them]. I inquired of the hostess if the Happy Hour applied only to the bar, or if it also encompassed the dining room. She stated it was in the bar only, adding ""but I am sure your waiter will be able to accommodate you since we are not busy"". When the tall waiter arrived at the table, I inquired about Happy Hour wines and he stated ""He did not have the menu and he would need ""manager approval"". I replied ""Don't bother"", since the hassle and effort was not worth it. Regardless, the regular price of the House Chardonnay at BJ's is only $6.50, which beats a Gaslamp ""Happy Hour"" $10.00 wine price any day.  While I was looking over the menu, another waiter was in a loud personal conversation with another server which was distracting. Happily, after about five minutes of my hearing all about his life, that waiter went back to work.  The WIFI works perfectly.  I noted the restaurant seems fond of squeezing twosomes into tiny booths squashed against a divider, even though there were many more commodious tables available. The menu is presented in a plasticized spiral ""notebook"". On the cover of the menu is a photograph of a large dessert [""Salted Caramel 'Pizookie'""]. I do not like to see a photograph of a dessert on the cover of a menu from which I am ordering my meal. It makes it looks like a dessert menu.  I ordered the Chicken Club Sandwich on grilled sourdough, served with French Fries, which was delivered with lightening speed.  The after-dinner Irish Coffee was properly made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa,3.36,3.28,3.172,,3.3120000000000003

1,Jerry P.,"Escondido, CA",74,94,87.0,5.0,2017-11-12,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's restaurant.   I enjoy the beers they brew, almost everything I have tried on the menu has been fantastic, and I have never had bad service.   The place is popular, so when you go, prepare to wait.   The Stout and Red beers they have are amazing.  I just tried their IPA and wasn't that much of a fan of it.  I like Double IPA's b/c they have more of a bite to them, so that may be why I didn't enjoy it as much.   I tried several of their pizza's, but think the spicy chicken is my favorite.  I had their spaghetti and meatballs more than once and love it.  The portion sizes are large, so I always have the remainder the next day.   They have Pizookie dessert,  which comes in several different flavors, and you can mix two of them...  they are to amazing.  If you download their app, checkin with it, they will give you one for free. I've been to the North County location, Mission Valley, and now Grossmont Center here in California as well as a location in Maryland.   I have never had bad service, in fact, every employee I dealt with had great attitudes, excellent sense of humors, and were very prompt and attentive.    I definitely recomend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa,3.4,3.33,3.192,,3.358

24,Suzanne C.,"San Diego, CA",19,70,27.0,4.0,2017-11-18,The food is good. Our server was very sweet and attentive until we got our meal but that all changed when she notified us that she was going on her dinner break and another server was going to take over. He only showed up after we were finished eating. We ran out of drinks by the time he showed up. We then ordered dessert and it took about 20-30 mins for us to get it. During that time no one picked up our empty dinner plates until he brought the dessert out and by that time we were out of drinks again. Then we had to wait forever to get the bill. Thankfully BJs has an app that allows you to just pay through the app otherwise we would probably still be waiting for our bill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa?start=20,3.28,3.33,3.176,,3.31

We had ordered a deep dish buffalo pizza and it was super good. (Could have used a little more buffalo sauce though) I really liked the dough and tge flavors mingled well together. We also had a flat thin market pizza, Italian something. It was also very good. Only thing that sucked here was that we had to ask fir for the channel to be changed 3x before it happened. It was the manager who was in charge of it but it felt like we didnt matter to him. By the time he changed it we were almost done with our pizza. Oh well kinda sucky.Anyway the server was good and so was the food. I'll definitely come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-la-mesa,3.52,3.35,3.176,,3.418

50,Rachel B.,"Lakeside, CA",0,7,,1.0,2017-12-03,"We have been here many times before but lately service has been less than satisfactory. Tonight we made a reservation for a party of 8 for 6:30. We arrived around 6:25, and when we went to check in we were told by the hostess we would have to wait about 30 minutes. We argued with her a bit and were able to get it down to 20 minutes. We were seated in the back, our waitress was friendly but didn't seem to know what was going on. She mixed up some of our drinks and at the end mixed up our checks as well. It took them two reminders to get them to bring us some utensils. One person in our party didn't get her meal until we were all almost done. And one of our drinks was served in a cracked glass. The last time we were here we had a similar situation where a pizza we ordered was made incorrectly and then the new one didn't come out until everyone was finished. The manager was not very understanding and she did comp the pizza but we could tell she didn't want to. The menu is good and the wait staff is usually nice but the service just isn't worth it.

I called in fridah night at 9:16 pm was instantly put on hold okay no biggie. . She came back to the phone with an attitude.. I order the great white pizza (it was my favorite) I ask for tomatoes and mushrooms on half the pizza only.. she repeated my order back to me correctly.. . I proceeded to go get my order... rude as hell at the register not sure the gals name.. they brought my pizza out completely wrong mushrooms on all the pizza no tomatoes at all. So I let them know that they messed it up .. they took it back with a bunch more attitude.. 15 mins later brought me another pizza (great white) completely cold no mushrooms an tomatoes on the entire pizza and still had the nerve to cop an attitude.. at this point I'm completely frustrated. I'm allergic to these veggies. My pizza is cold. So I let them know it was WRONG AGAIN. Another 20 minutes later I finally got the pizza I ordered. && It was completely dried out also. The customer service running thru this business is SHIT.  The job of a waiter an waitress is to  listen an write the order down. . Completely disappointed an WILL NOT RETURN. Mind you they mess up the same pizza every time I go in. This time I did curb side to save time.. it was a 35 minute ordeal when it should of taken 5 minutes. Booooo.
