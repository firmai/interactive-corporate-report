Trebla H.,"Bayamón, Puerto Rico",13,45,103,5.0,4/2/2015,"I've come here at least 3x and have not been disappointed. I highly recommend the salads (ie tuna tataki, mandarin chicken, kale salmon) and the cheesecake (ie Godiva omg!!!). The ambience is great whether you eat inside or out. Service is great. Their steaks are often a miss, so I usually avoid those. Overall one of the better places to eat here in PR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Ruth S.,"Tomás de Castro, Puerto Rico",1,35,2,3.0,11/14/2015,The food is mediocre.  Only thing worth buying is the cheesecake.  You'll never have a cheesecake as good as these.  Favorite is the pumpkin flavored one!  So good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Mario B.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,10,4.0,5/7/2015,"My wife loves it! Great variety of cheesecakes! Came hungry before my wife and 4 more people, asked for a table and was told: ""Let me know when your party arrives!"" Very nice way to treat regular customers! Will add more stars thanks to manager Freddie Jusino who was excellent handling the situation! Excellent manager and human being who knows how to treat the customers!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Maria-Bonnie C.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",135,18,18,3.0,11/15/2014,Huge portions! I always have leftovers! Service is great very fast and efficient.  Always clean. The bathrooms are well kept. The drinks are good but a bit pricey.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Michael T.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,11,4,4.0,7/8/2015,Friendly service good food for decent price. I recommend it. The bathroom is clean you don't have to wait for your table most of the time. It is in a good area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Nihal S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,51,21,5.0,5/31/2015,"We can be counted as regulars of the Cheesecake Factory in Atlanta. After having more than enough Puerto Rican food, we decided to go back to basics and have a dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. The food was amazing as usual and the service was really fast, our waiter was very attentive and nice. Overall we were quite happy about our experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
George R.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,6,,4.0,5/25/2015,"Nice food. Great cheesecakes, beautiful and perfect location at Plaza las America. A bit expensive but I think its worth the money.

Mya W.,"Washington, DC",0,48,49,2.0,5/22/2015,Came here for a quick bite to eat before shopping in the mall. The food was mediocre at best. Got a skinnylicious sausage ricotta flatbread and a passion fruit margarita both was just average.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Nicola D.,"Newark, NJ",10,82,134,3.0,7/18/2014,"I ordered a factory burger without pickles and tomato. My burger came with American cheese and bun. The burger should of been accompanied with grilled onions, lettuce and cheddar cheese. The waiter was super polite but did not do a good job as a server. However, with all this my meal was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Christopher P.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",13,3,1,1.0,7/14/2014,"BAD SERVICE!!! waiter was never around when I needed something. Horrible service. Not coming back, felt like it was a waste of time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Chiqui C.,"San Sebastián, Puerto Rico",1,63,40,3.0,4/28/2014,"The food is over price and is as common as you can get. The cheesecakes are really good, but the place is too crowded due to people wanting to try the new place. Go, take a dessert to go at the entrance store and don't eat common food very pricy. If you want a better food, and better cheeseakes, more fresh and better taste, go to Cheesecake Shoppe in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, and you will try this place for desserts only when you don't have the time to travel and the feeling of saving, because you will pay a Puerto Rican chef half the price for the best pizza in the world and the best Pumpkin Cheesecake ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Luis A.,"Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico",18,8,8,2.0,8/10/2014,"I don't mind expensive, if it comes along with great food and service. In this case it was just expensive. I don't anticipate coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Walter M.,"Guaynabo, Puerto Rico",0,30,,3.0,10/24/2015,"First time wasn't too thrilled about my experience. But I decided to go again for a quick bite, and give the place a second chance, and I must say that the experience was much better. Shared a Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread and the Firecracker Salmon. Both were wonderful. Had a couple of drinks (Cosmopolitans, actually, never had one before), very good. The waiter even offered the suggestion to bring mine in a normal drink glass, and the bartender actually even sent the leftover mix in a different glass. I would say that was very decent and honest of the place and wait staff (have actually seen places were the drink didn't fit the glass or cup and the bartender either drank the left over or threw it out...not cool). Also shared a cheesecake, The Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake with Ice Cream on the side...wonderful but be careful if you do not have a sweet tooth. Overall service was wonderful; our waiter really made the effort to make us feel welcomed and very helpful, though not overbearing. Also the woman behind the dessert counter took some time to explain the cheesecakes and to offer her favorite when asked by my companion. In all, a very good experience. I'm glad I decided to try once again. A little pricey, but I will go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
The W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,17,,3.0,9/1/2013,"We visited on the 28th during the grand opening at Las Plazas Americas. An hour wait or so, typical of the Cheesecake Factory. I had the dynamite shrimp, which was excellent. She had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta which was very good as well. Services could've been better definitely, but since it was their first day I gave them a pass.. and it was certainly crazy in there.. very long lines!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Carlos R.,"Caguas, Puerto Rico",0,3,,5.0,6/9/2015,"Excellent food with a great service. I went there on a Friday and the place was full...still, the food was delicious and hot. I ordered the hibachi steak and it was very good for the price. I am going back ....this place is much better than chillis!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Ricardo M.,"Hormigueros, Puerto Rico",0,2,,2.0,9/28/2013,"Visited the restaurant for the first time on a Friday afternoon. After a long  over 45 min wait we finally had a table. Our waiter was very enthusiastic and helpful. We quickly had our drinks delivered and order a couple of appetizers. They were tastylicious. Then we order our entrees. Our waiter did a good job selling us the Kobe burgers . We ordered them medium rare. Unfortunately they came medium well. A $15 burger that was dry , and a little on the bland side. Not worth the wait or the money. May go back maybe in a year or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan?start=20
Kai W.,"Kahala, Honolulu, HI",114,32,62,5.0,9/18/2017,"We came here to use a $75 gift card. The super anti oxidant salad started us off with its delicious blend of baby field greens spinach and baby kale. Halved grapes, cubes pear and dried blueberries added a hint of sweet to this delicious salad that was topped with slivered almonds sunflower seeds. A little more Texture included white radicchio and broccoli heads for that satisfying crunch. I dined on the Thai coconut chicken while my boyfriend has the ribeye steak. Excellent all around!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Diane C.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,29,54,4.0,11/18/2016,Had lunch here today with my family in San Juan Puerto Rico.. I ate the kale and quinoa salad with salmon. It was delicious. We were a party of 10 and the service was amazing. The whole party enjoyed their food. We will definitely be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Angel G.,"Fort Knox, KY",6,41,22,5.0,3/22/2017,Everything you would expect from a Cheesecake Factory. The only thing I was overly impressed about at this location was the attentive service. My waitress Nicole was very on top of things. She was always anticipating what may be needed next.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Elsie M.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",4,8,5,3.0,4/21/2017,"I do not like spicy food, I ask for for something that was not, my beef have so much pepper that I did not like it. Good service and great cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Jose H.,"Orlando, FL",34,67,318,4.0,3/11/2017,"Beautiful dinning well ambient with great service.  Options are infinite.  We had chicken madeira plate, four cheese pasta and a salmon.  All highly recommended.  One of our favorite places to have a good time with top notch food for all different tastes.  A bit pricy but is worth considering portions and quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Tamara F.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,7,7,4.0,6/13/2017,The staff have it down. We love sharing an entree here because they're so huge. Happy hour is a must! The happy hour burger and avocado egg rolls are my favorite!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Lashanda L.,"Baltimore, MD",67,273,777,5.0,1/1/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory in Puerto Rico. Let's face it...every place I have gone to in PR operates on island time. Things are slower, but not to a fault. The wait was not as bad as you find in the states to get a table. We were seated within 15 minutes of arriving. We only came for dessert and drinks, but I couldn't resist ordering the avocado rolls. They were quite good and the same as any CCF. The Mai Tai I ordered was large and looked amazing. The chocolate mousse cheesecake was over the top chocolate-y. Just as I expected. Service from Anna was good and attentive. Good music entertained us, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Clayton C.,"Inver Grove Heights, MN",42,15,1,2.0,8/8/2017,We were greeted kindly by the staff. Good first impression but It seems we were just another table to get in and out when the meal was over. $35 for two coffees and two cheesecakes. :( Also we never received any bread.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Ms B.,"Palmdale, CA",2,89,54,5.0,6/24/2016,This is probably one of the better places to eat in PR for the service and amount of food you get. The food seems to be made fresh and the cheesecakes are awesome no matter what kind you get.  I just had the tiramisu cheesecake which was to die for and I ate it so fast with my kids that I didn't even take a pic.  You really can't go wrong here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
S R.,"Tempe, AZ",1,21,,1.0,7/12/2017,Horrible experience! Our waitress was terrible we waited almost 30 minutes just to get waters around the table. Complained to another waitress and the service continued to be poor the rest of our evening. It was a very disappointing experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Jennifer N.,"Sacramento, CA",581,458,1084,4.0,4/30/2014,"This was my second time at this Cheesecake Factory.  Food:  Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp: Curry, coconut chicken and shrimp sauteed with vegetables served with white rice. This dish was sooooooo good! The portion was huge. I took half home and it was still delicious the next day! I want some more! I now have a favorite dish at The Cheesecake Factory :) The chicken didn't pick up as much flavor as the shrimp, so next time I think I will order shrimp only. I love the Bang-Bang sauce, I wish they gave me more. 5/5 White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle: yummy! 4/5 Service: I came for a surprise birthday dinner on a Monday at 6PM. We requested outdoor seating for 10 people in the back of the restaurant so the birthday girl would not see us. The staff were very accommodating. It only took them 10 minutes to set up the tables. I was very impressed with the service we received. 5/5 Final thoughts: I cannot wait to come back for more Bang-Bang!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Sarah A.,"Milton, MA",159,1158,145,4.0,6/21/2015,"Pretty typical Cheesecake Factory. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a pineapple mojito, eggs Benedict and a cafe mocha. Everything was great. Service was excellent throughout the meal but slowed down a bit when I was trying to cash out. Bathroom was clean and they have a cool looking sink. The outside waiting area is also nice with lots of seating and shade. Valet parking and patio dining s well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Derman O.,"New York, NY",167,96,180,4.0,1/28/2016,"At plaza las Americas. If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, then you've been to them all but I doubt you've tried it all so I had to give it four stars. The bar is usually empty and except for a few times I've been here, the service has been great. Food is fresh and comes out looking like time was spent making it which is rare in PR. Recommended for sensitive stomachs who havent been able to eat food on vacation in PR. This will let you eat and you definitely have more than enough choices to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4425,2442,5446,4.0,9/2/2014,"For some reason I feel off the wagon and went into a food and sugar coma and started eating cheesecake again to feed my carb starved body, which just means lots more workouts and exercise to make up for it, but in the end it was worth it as their cheesecakes are delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Isabel G.,"Manhattan, NY",167,14,12,5.0,2/12/2016,"One of my go to places to eat when I don't have no idea what to eat. The staff is usually friendly and helpful. On weekdays they have the happy hour with drinks at 5.50 and appetizers are cheaper. My fav appetizer is the mac and cheese fried balls which are amazing. Be sure to go there with your stomach empty because even the lunch portions are pretty huge. Also, be sure to get the godiva cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan

Bhajneet K.,"Queens, NY",0,1,4,1.0,12/10/2016,"Ordered the vegan Cobb salad, disappointed in the portion and there was one piece of asparagus , like 10 kernels of chick peas and a pinch of seeds with loads of iceberg lettuce.

Alberto R.,"Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico",26,56,49,3.0,3/20/2014,"Great expectations often lead to great disappointments and this was no exception.  After the overwhelming first impression of the size and décor of this restaurant that now dwarfs the entrance of the Plaza Las Americas shopping center you will have to wrestle with the largest menu ever seen for a casual family restaurant. Service was quick and attentive in spite of the lamest black or white uniforms last seen on insane asylum workers.  The expensive décor apparently left no budget for more cheerful clothing.   The listing of a ground Kobe beef burger made my choice an easy one. Setting aside the fact that grinding Kobe beef should be outlawed, this sounded like the promise of the best burger ever. My wife chose the Chile Relleno burger done with Angus beef. Both were good, but not up to the star billing promised. In traditional gringo burger style, neither meat is seasoned and depends on the provided salt, pepper and ketchup for any flavor. The included lettuce, one slice of tomato, overcooked onions, and bland mushrooms did not redeem the meat. (See picture) Kobe beef import stopped being allowed in the USA until recently and remains scarce and very expensive. This burger did not say Kobe to me, and their web site calls it ""American Kobe beef"" which is as deceitful as saying ""American Champagne"" In addition to the questionable food, my rating dropped a full star upon seen that all the cutlery is placed right on the table surface at each table. No place mats. No napkins. Right on the top that every hand  rests upon. (See picture). I asked for all new cutlery and was promptly brought new napkin-wrapped sets. Still this is an unhygienic practice that cannot be condoned. The restaurant is also leaving itself open to a major fine by the Treasury Department by not giving the IVU Loto tickets with the bill or credit card transaction. You will only get  your ticket if you ask for it - and are willing to wait until the additional transaction is separately performed.  I am reporting this to Hacienda and I hope that management changes this practice before they are heavily fined. Finally . . . the cheesecakes . . . the raison d'être of this location. They all looked good, but at about $8.00 a pop for a very modest slice, we chose to pass on dessert. Our two burgers, one beer, and one coffee ran a $45 tab after tax and tip. A bit too rich for a lackluster experience. No real reason to come back . . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Chinemelu E.,"Istanbul, Turkey",65,274,315,4.0,6/21/2015,"The service wasn't the best, but when we did attend to they were extremely nice. The food was pretty good! So many people around you enjoying their meals with laughter. Just let's you know the type of place your dining at, which is a good thing! Of course the dessert is one of the main appeal's of Cheesecake Factory and they do not fail in this regard. I would recommend everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
Lisa G.,"Guaynabo, Puerto Rico",94,33,142,3.0,5/13/2015,"Good service... For some reason The last two times I've ordered my favorite flatbread pizza, they taste like it's made with water from the faucet.. Actually from a water hose",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-juan
