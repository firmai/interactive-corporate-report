162,Concerned P.,"Glendora, CA",1,6,,1.0,2012-05-24,"This has got to be the worst Chilis on the face of the planet!  The service is lousey and the staff seem like its a chore to serve you.  Not one of our orders was right and it took forever to get appetizers.  They blamed it on a lack of skillets.  Hello it's a resturant...how can you not have enough skillets.  Thats why you hire minimum wage workers to clean the dirty ones!  The last 2 times we were there, at least one of our meals ended up on the floor.  The last time I had to get up and refill my own drink!  We wont be going back to this Chilis again.  The Chilis in Glendora is awesome, though, and J.P. will treat you like a king AND get  your order right!  Do yourself a favor and skip this Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=160,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

143,Brian B.,"La Verne, CA",1,16,,2.0,2013-03-16,"This Chili's is disappointing compared to others Chili's I've been to in different areas of the country. The servers are sub-par as well as the food. The only reason it has a crowd is because it is the only restaurant of that type in that immediate area so the choices are limited. Last time we were there my wife order a steak - medium and it came out bloody. The manager came out and was awkwardly nonchalant about it. He said several times that the steak was very rare.  They took it off the bill and gave us one to go. When we got home and opened the box it was a different steak but just as bloody.

Baby back ribs were VERY VERY dry and over cooked. Barely had any meat on the ribs. It was mostly bone. The fajitas weren't too bad. Had few steak, chicken, and shrimp chunks but I wouldn't call it good either. There's not enough meat for the onions though. The cheese pizza, the dough was so thick! It was just like a thick dough with some pizza sauce and cheese on it. I'm not sure if that can even be consider a good pizza. Don't know how you can mess up on pizza anyway. Their free salsa and chips were the best.  House salsa was really good If service was good, maybe it would've made up for the bad food and I would've given another star.. First, the food took forever to come out. I believe it took 30 minutes and they weren't even busy. The place was pretty empty...

I was already in a bit of a bad mood because my drink was so packed with ice I could barely get my straw in (grapefruit juice). I hate that! Anyhow, come to find out my supposed to be meatless nachos had meat in them. I specifically told the girl like 5 times no meat. There's nothing I could have done to make it clearer. I gotta be honest, I was PISSED! She might as well have just spat in my food right there at the table. I wanted to just leave, but being 35 weeks pregnant and starving that wasn't really an option. The manager made it right though. Even though I feel bad about getting free food. That's the only train I hate complaining, I don't want them to think I'm just trying to get a free meal/discount.

The price of a chicken and steak fajita is about 13.95 with rice and beans is an extra 99 cents.  The food was sorted for easier transportation. However, the quantities for rice and beans was small due to the small packaging containers.  The half rack of ribs was about $14.95. The quantity was small.

Our server got there quick after being seated, but it took a little longer than usual to get our drinks and our appetizers. I get the tablets on the tables making it a bit easier to order extras and pay your bill, but it seems to take away from customer service. It seems as if the servers depend on them more than they have to and makes them try a little less and they seem to come around the tables less. We asked our server if we could take it off the table so our little ones wouldn't break it, but we were told that we pay and order extras from there. Our server never came back to ask us for dessert or give us our check. We had to figure it out ourselves after waiting a while.

Also, our waitress had a stick up her butt; do your job and stop talking to your friends about your weekend.  Food: sub par...should have gone to Dennys.  Worst restaurant ever. Seriously, don't even waste your time here. I wish there was an option to give this place 0 stars. For starters, the waitress had a bad attitude from the moment she took our drink order...two iced waters. Then after she dropped off our appetizer, we didn't see her again for 45 mins. No popping in to check on us, nothing.  The water was the worst part. Nasty water. I get that it's tap water but it tasted like something died in it. It was revolting. When I mentioned this to our waitress, she just gave me a dirty look and asked if I wanted to order something else. So I got a soda....same thing. The water used to make the soda was the same nasty tasting crap. I didn't drink it after one sip.  The appetizer, spinach and artichoke dip, was okay but the chips tasted like someone dipped the bucket of chips in a salt bath. It made us thirsty but we couldn't drink the water! The food finally arrived almost 50 mins later....I had enough.  I spoke with the manager, Mike, about the issues. He acknowledged that they were having an issue with their water ALL DAY. Wtf. If you knew this, why expose your customers to it without compensating or offering bottled water?! For all I know, I could have been exposed to some nasty mold or God forbid E. coli in the water!  Seriously, do businesses not give a shit anymore?  Worst experience ever. The manager comped our dinner, but the damage was done. This place didn't squeeze a penny out of us, and for good reason.  Get your shit together, people.

103,Saint E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",41,49,9.0,1.0,2014-10-13,"The only reason I am giving this review one star is because the food was decent. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything good about the service at this particular restaurant. The server (Ernie) was either having a very bad night, or he was brand new at his job.  His service was extremely poor and very disappointing. He was drenched with sweat when he first introduced himself to us. After we got our food, it took him FOREVER to come back to our table to check on us before we were able to ask him for a side of ranch dressing. My wife ordered a second drink and the drink took so long that she did not get it until after she finished her meal.  When Ernie brought us the check, he placed it facedown on a small puddle of water, rendering the check soggy and hardly legible. To top it off, he forgot to return my credit card to me, which I did not realize until I left the restaurant. When I return to the restaurant to retrieve my credit card, Ernie had a bit of an attitude with me, even though it was his fault and not mine. Furthermore, Ernie said his manager (whom the hostess identified as ""Mike"") had the credit card, as Ernie walked to the kitchen to summon the manager to return my card. Moments later, Ernie came back with my card and handed it to me without saying a word of apology. I stood there expecting the manager to come and talk to me but he never showed up. I decided that it was a lost cause and left the establishment. If you're going to dine at a Chili's, go to a different one and not this one on Summit. Better yet, go to Applebee's on Sierra Lakes Parkway where the service is 10 times better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=80,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.404,2.84

At the peak lunch hour it was completely packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.

Taste-wise the rolls in the triple dipper were good whereas the wings seemed stale and tasteless. The chicken and steak fajita was delivered to the table sizzling, but it lacked any pazzazz. At least it was properly seasoned and edible. Surprisingly the best thing served to us was the salmon in the combination entree. It was cooked just right ensuring a moist and juicy bite but the chicken in the combo was dry from being overcooked. The chocolate molten cake was Blahh.  Service was a bit slow but it always feels that way when you are hungry. Pricewise also it was not too bad for a sit down meal. What would sum up this experience would be boring.

I'm not one to call for a manager, but I had to in this case. The manager, Namsah (hope I spelled her name correctly ) addressed the issue with great service, and an even greater apology. She gave us tableside homemade guacamole on the house, and she even prepared it!!  She had Melissa, our server, come and take care of us afterwards. She was very attentive, kind, and also apologetic.

Someway or another, we'd always end up ""forgotten"" when this hostess was the one seating us. Fortunately, she is no longer working here, but the service is, sadly, not as consistent as it should be.  The food has never been an issue (hence the OKness). I really enjoy their chips and guacamole, and they have several entrees that I am a fan of. I like the tex-mex pairing menu, as well as the fajitas. Can't go wrong with those. They also used to have this amazingly delicious watermelon lemonade, but I'm not sure where that went.  The place itself can be really dirty at times. Tables not clean for a while, etc. You never really know what you're going to get on any given day.  My best advice, cross your fingers before you walk in and hope it's a good visit!

We checked in online and only had to wait about 10 minutes once we arrived.  We were seated at the crappiest table in the entire restaurant. Right next to the kitchen and the bathrooms. Literally my view was of a wall. When the host sat us, there wasn't even enough chairs for my entire family. So he had to go round them up. You'd think that this would be done prior to us being seated. We ordered the chips and guacamole to start. Most of the chips were soggy and oily. Not even remotely crispy. We were hungry, so we ate them anyway. My husband and I split the fajita trio which was mostly vegetables for $17.99. The steak was poor quality and very fatty. The chicken had zero flavor and there were only 5 tiny shrimp. Beans were cold and some of the shredded cheese had mold. My son ordered the club sandwich that was literally falling apart when brought to the table. The top of the sandwich bread had slid off and nobody bothered to think ""Hey, this looks like somebody's leftovers, we should remake it properly."" Nope. Just served it to us anyway. The lettuce was wilted and fries were cold.  Service was okay. Nothing spectacular, but the food and ambience were so shitty it really wouldn't have mattered. $67 for food that was one step above cafeteria slop. I would have had a better meal at In-N-Out for $15. I guess I value my money more than most, but I am really tired of restaurants serving shit food for nearly $100. Completely ridiculous.

26,Danielle M.,"Ontario, CA",0,11,,1.0,2018-01-06,i walked into chilis with my husband and 2 children around 9pm today . the restaurant was very empty only the bar was occupied . several servers walked past us and none of them spoke to us or tried to help seat us . we stood in the front of the restaurant for about 20 minutes with a baby and a 4 year old and all the employees could care less . so we left . i will never be back and i would never give my hard earned money to a crap establishment like this location .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana,2.92,2.65,2.65,,2.758
