Sarah T.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",70,138,251,3.0,4/24/2016,"One of my friends and I used to come here a lot over the years though we don;t as much anymore. There are so many more exciting places to eat now in Glasgow and when I think burger I don't immediately think 'TGI Fridays'. Anyway, she wanted to go and since it was her pick, I was happy to go along. It's not a bad place!  For a Sunday late afternoon/early evening it was pretty busy and really loud for that time of day (are we getting old? Perhaps!). It was just louder than normal and our initial reaction was to run and never look back. Then the drunken table of six next to us left and all was well again. Thank goodness for that.  I was really in the mood for a cheeseburger which was okay. Not the best burger in the world, but yummy enough. The fries were pretty good and the burger sauce is yummy. Decent meal but nothing exciting.  Service was okay. I do like the cocktails here so I'd come back for that and maybe some nibbles, but there are so many better burger places in Glasgow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Becca W.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",55,31,28,2.0,4/7/2016,"Tried TGI's for a few drinks a week or so ago due to other people's choice... given the choice I wouldn't choose to go back in a rush.  Firstly I'm not too keen on how they work when you want to go in just for a drink. We waited in a small queue (which was fine and quick) to ask if we could be seated just for a couple of cocktails. Then, before anything else was said we were immediately ID'd. That's fine to ID people, especially as I'm aware it's 'think 25' and places have to ID, but we weren't 16 year olds trying to get in to get drunk. One of us was 26... anyway. That was fine but a bit odd before we even got to the bar. Then as soon as we got to the bar, which was about 30 seconds away, we got asked to show it again. After saying we just got asked, we still had to show again and the guy was annoyed that we said that. He then stared at them all for ages. Again, felt like 16 year olds so wasn't keen on that whole set up but if that's how they operate then fair enough. Now the drinks themselves: they're pretty cheap, around £6 for a small and some of them come in a large, which arrive in massive round glasses for around £8 which is pretty darn good. Unfortunately they taste cheap. I tried 3 different ones and they all just tasted like juice. Watered down juice as well. One of my friend's that I tasted (the lime daiquiri) was so weak but the only taste was weak alcohol, and next to no lime. Weird and not great. I wasn't there to get drunk but if you get a cocktail you don't expect it to be tasteless or taste like watery juice. All in all they were okay for what they were, and I'm aware it's a chain (a fairly cheap one) but I'm just giving my opinion on them as everyone raves about the drinks, so I expected them to be a bit better! I'm not really commenting about the food because I didn't eat that time, and haven't for a while, but from what I remember last time I don't think the food is anything to rave about either.  It's just basic, mostly not very exciting food. Basically if I wanted a burger, there's so many amazing burger joints in Glasgow now that I wouldn't recommend here. As goes for steak etc. as well unfortunately!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Alison M.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",122,317,600,5.0,1/12/2016,"Always a delight to eat here: ample portions served with excellent customer service and due attention; even those with a limited appetite are not made to feel different when ordering a starter while a guest orders a Warrior burger, love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Mara M.,"Newton Mearns, United Kingdom",11,37,3,2.0,1/19/2016,"It has been years since I was in a Fridays and now I remember why: The same old microwaved food, over fried chicken fingers, and tasteless everything else. We stopped in for a quick bite before a concert and left wishing we had opted for something else. It's funny to see so many good reviews for what is basically a has-been US chain. It's true that you can buy everything Fridays serves in the frozen food section of the supermarket. Pretty much all the food comes out of a microwave. Twenty years ago Fridays was a novelty, now there are better choices.  Two stars because the wait staff were friendly.  Never again, TGIF's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland

Sophie K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",88,150,757,3.0,6/30/2015,"I have to admit, I was extremely apprehensive about coming to this place. We were a group of previous American studies masters students and myself (or, easier describable as a group of friends) and we seated at a booth table in the corner, under a huge red and white lamp. Walking in, it distinctly reminded me of the Hard Rock Café, but not so in your face.  We sat down, and personally I didn't think the seats were very comfortable and immediately my arm was stuck to the table -  ew, sticky tables.  While looking through the menus, our waitress whom I thought to be very brash and slightly rude, eventually took our drink orders (two of us had already received their bottomless cokes, but us girls ordered a big glass of rose for the Belgian friend, one large frozen strawberry margarita for my American friend, something the waitress loved to point out and a frozen raspberry daiquiri for myself, the German). My daiquiri turned out to be large as well, and my goodness, it was Large. To be honest, the drinks were expensive, even considering the size of them - not that this is something to complain about, but if I am spending £8 on a drink, I like there to be a hint of alcohol in it.  A long while passed, and she came back to take our orders. We ordered: a veggie burger, a well-done steak, a BLT chicken finger sandwich, a Jack Daniels chicken finger sandwich, and I opted for the classic cheeseburger sans tomato. Now, it was lucky that we had lots to chat about around the table because the food took at least 40 odd minutes to get to us. It also meant that by the time the food arrived, we were all actually hungry. My plate came with some sort of dipping sauce that looked like a cheesesauce. Turns out it was some sort of honey mustard, but not really but maybe something mustardy - but not awful. The fries were delightful. They were salty and fluffy and crispy and very, very tasty. The cheeseburger, arriving as requested sans tomato (big thumbs up for that), was good. It was dripping said honeymustard (?) sauce but it was not over powering. The patty slid around quite a bit so I cut the burger in half to keep some sort of dignity while eating it. The patty to brioche bun ratio was indeed acceptable, the meat was cooked well and all in all, I enjoyed my meal. The others also seemed to enjoy their dishes.  The bill came to just over £90, so I deem this place rather expensive. There was also quite a painful moment at the table beside ours, when the girl had to stand up, hold a plate when brash Glaswegian waitress shouted and clapped happy birthday at her. It was an undeniable case of Fremdschämen to me - I was awfully embarrassed for her. Brash waitress seemed to not realise that we wanted change and took her time bringing it back to us. On the whole, we saw very little of her - and that makes me think that paying £2.85 for bottomless soft drinks does not work (it does at other places, or in the states where people are usually are attentive or you are in control of your own drinks).  One thing I like about this place, although it's loud, I enjoy the music, it's a great combination of old school and classic tunes that reminded me of my past (in a good way).  In summary, I will say that I think I enjoyed my evening here mainly due to the company and being able to catch up with friends. I shan't not recommend (double negatives... oh no!) coming here, but I won't be rushing back mainly because Glasgow has places that offer better fayre for a lot less money too (student budget, people!), but I can't say I wasn't pleasantly surprised by the food (not the waiting staff or the random shouting and clapping of Happy Birthday. The poor girl).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Donald M.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",161,976,2534,3.0,1/14/2014,"I've been to TGI Fridays in the states on many occasions when l lived there and when you compare what we have in the UK to the states they are at opposite ends. I find the food not quite right but l suppose if you have not been to an original TGI Fridays you would not know any better. I took my partner with me on a week day for a late lunch, there was not a server designated to our table as we had three servers coming back and forth to our table, I think there was a shift change of staff.

Mera F.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",19,48,32,4.0,6/8/2015,"Always been a TGI's fan, it's a fancier version of fast food. It's higher on the scale than pizza hut but not hitting the special occasion dining.  Service is always good, happy staff that are always happy to help.

Emilia T.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",26,43,46,1.0,12/1/2015,"Definitely not going to be rushing back. I had a meal with my family here, picked by my mom as she remembers TGIs to be nice from experiences in the past. I couldn't believe how much the quality had fallen! My mom had nachos as a starter and we found a sauce sticker inside. When my burger came basically it looked and tasted like a McDonald's burger... not worth the £12 price tag. We also had the full rack of ribs - small portion but otherwise okay. The service was also pretty bad. We asked for a black coffee and got a latte, when we raised it they didn't want to change it immediately. Overall a negative experience and wouldn't recommend visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Eleanor H.,"Perth, United Kingdom",16,18,3,2.0,1/18/2016,"Overrated. Food tends to be a bit average and predictable for me.

Martyn M.,"London, United Kingdom",356,380,250,3.0,8/10/2013,"The other night was the first time I ever went to TGI's, because I'd never really fancied it and this specific one is always absolutely mobbed. With promise of large tasty cocktails though, I managed to head along.  It's absolutely huge inside, with two floors of seating and a giant bar you can chill at, and the cocktails are glorious, but I can't really find much else good to say about it. The staff, on the most part, are incompetent and incredibly slow, apart from one waitress we had who was great. The food was meh, and the atmosphere is a bit chaotic when it's full.  If I was going back here it would definitely be for the cocktails. The large ones come in huge fishbowl glasses and are only about £8.

Matt F.,"Manchester, CT",4,13,1,3.0,10/24/2014,"All right, time for the American to write another review of an American establishment in Glasgow.  This is one of the few American sit-in chains in the UK, let alone Glasgow.  It's MOSTLY similar. TGIF's prides itself on starters.  You can find them in any stateside supermarket's frozen aisle.  They're great here as well.  My favourite would be the soft pretzels and cheese dip.  The cheese has a sharpness to it that puts it a cut above your typical nacho cheese, and the pretzels are salty and greasy enough to satisfy your cravings.  The buffalo wings are on point, too.  Still not REAL buffalo wings, but the sauce is proper. The menu is unsurprisingly small compared to its counterpart across the pond.  You'll find a good selection, but I honestly haven't been thrilled with anything other than burgers/sandwiches and the ribs.  And even those aren't quite as good as the ones I've had in the US. As its name would imply, Friday's also attempts to be the ""party night spot"" for drinks and such.  The drink menu is bigger than the food menu, and it's filled with a lot of tasty cocktails and such.  Some are unique to the UK, as you'd expect.  You can get a giant glass for £7-8, but drink it fast because they usually put a lot of ice in there!  There's your excuse to order more.  You're welcome. All in all, I don't think it's quite as good as the Friday's in America food-wise, but everything else is on par.  It's a great spot for a few drinks, but they don't take bookings so be prepared to wait on busier nights.  Not as bad as Hard Rock in that regard, though. No sense in promoting this place as it's hard to miss, but it's a pretty good ""we're picky"" or ""everyone keeps asking 'I dunno where do YOU want to go?'"" choice for lunch or dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Barbara H.,"London, United Kingdom",82,37,24,4.0,11/14/2014,"As far as chain restaurants go, this was an excellent one. I hit upon it for lunch because it looked nice and bright. Interior is very similar to Hard Rock. The staff was excellent, from the time we entered the door until departure. Food was well prepared even if I did choose a messy burger. I was a wee bit disappointed in the choice of beers. Nothing exotic or exciting. I was really looking for a local IPA. Nonetheless , a good experience and I'd go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland

Laura P.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",191,120,427,4.0,6/6/2014,"I know chain restaurants like this are not for everyone but personally I've always quite enjoyed TGIs over the years.  The restaurant is bright and airy and on this visit we managed to wangle a booth style seat looking out to Buchanan Street. The servers are all super smiley American style and our waitress, Jill actually was American, so that added to the experience! Sometimes I've found the music a bit loud in here but on this occasion it was nice having some cheery tunes in the background.  The menu is focused around a variety of burgers, sandwiches, fajita dishes, ribs and other American classics. The burgers are now all served in brioche style buns and come with a choice of fries/ sweet potato fries or salad.  I opted for the veggie sandwich with salad and balsamic dressing hold the cheese! For some reason they call it a sandwich but it was just a veggie burger really, all be it a pretty tasty one with beans and spices. The brioche bun was sweet and tasty and the salad was pretty big with a pot of dressing on the side.  I noticed that my dressing didn't look like balsamic but was too busy with the ketchup to bother, but our lovely server Jill noticed on the way past and quickly swapped it for balsamic.  My dining companion opted for a chicken sandwich (burger :)) with fries and really enjoyed it, although she did say the fries were nothing special.  Now you can't go to TGIs without getting a dessert and the classic one I love which has remained unchanged for years is the chocolate fudge cake. Two spoons, don't bother with the icecream please and we were in sweet chocolate heaven. This isn't just any chocolate cake. This is TGIs chocolate fudge fixation cake - three layers of chocolate cake sandwiched with chocolate sauce and chocolate runny fudgy yumminess with more chocolate ganache sauce yumminess round the sides. I'll stop now - anyway it was good! The service was fast although it was only a mid- week night. I would say I always fine that TGIs is slightly overpriced- roughly £10 for a burger and accompaniment and about £6 for dessert (but desserts easily would do two people). Cocktails aren't really my thing but I know a lot of people who love them and from a quick look at the menu there's some unusual and tasty sounding ones to choose from.  Overall a tasty meal and great service and somewhere I'll definitely continue to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Stefanie L.,"London, United Kingdom",6,18,5,2.0,9/9/2013,"I'm not so sure about this place... The floor was sticky. Like, my feet stuck to the floor. The table was sticky as well; very unpleasant. I had one of the cooler summer drinks, which tasted pretty much only like ice infused with a sad bit of fruit syrup. The whiskey (I think?) sauce that came with the chicken wings was amazing; the wings didn't blow me away. The dessert - toffee popcorn brownie sundae - was spectacular. Overall, everything seemed a bit overpriced. The service was ridiculously bad - we had to wait ages for some drinks; and we were trying to catch the staff's attention for about 15 minutes straight while three of them were standing at the bar having a nice chat with each other... Overall, you pay more for the brand than anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Leia M.,United Kingdom,0,14,,4.0,10/27/2013,"TGI Fridays is right on the corner of Buchanan Street. As you are walking up the street you can see the big red and white sign that says 'TGI Fridays'. It is easy to spot. As you walk in the first thing you see is the glass doors leading in to the restaurant. The walls are decorated with pictures. The place is quite dark and there isn't much lighting apart from the windows. I ordered the 'Classic American' burger with chips and an Oreo Milkshake. My food and drink both arrived quickly (Within 10-15 minutes). It was delicious. My burger was topped with tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese and Fridays trademark mayo. This was all served on a toasted crispy sesame seed bun. The burger was juicy, the lettuce was crisp, the tomato was fresh and the mayo was sensational. I definitely recommend it. The fries were really nice too. They were thin, crispy and nicely seasoned with salt and pepper. The Oreo Milkshake is definitely the best I've ever had. It was thick and extremely creamy. Overall, the meal was fantastic and very filling too.  The service was good and very cheery. The staff were all friendly. The toilets were very clean. The price though, is a little too much. Another negative point is that if you aren't ordering burgers, steaks or ribs (Grilled foods) then the food quality isn't as good. Overall, TGI Fridays is clean, offers great food, great service and I would give it 4/5. As the Fridays motto says 'In here, It's always Friday!'",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
James N.,"Houston, United Kingdom",12,54,,4.0,8/27/2013,"So my friend had £180.00 worth of vouchers for TGI and being the generously, selfless soul that he is he decided to let his friends abuse his hospitality.  Que extravagant cocktail order: ""Yes I would like to make all 10 of those cocktails ultimate"" or buying enough food to feed a small country. I don't love TGIs and this review is definitely biased owing to the fact that I paid £10.00 for two courses lots of drinks and that still left a generous tip.  Lets be fair it's not TGI's fault that my friend has more money than sense.  It was a busy Friday night so we were split between two medium sized table that were beside each other.  Not ideal but we were a walk in on a Friday night so I can't really fault them for that.   Four of us shared the times square plater.  Despite the fact that this said serves 2-3 people it more than filled a hole and gave us a delicious variety of things filled with cheese, not so great if you're on a diet, and a heap load of chicken wings and other things.  Everything on this giant plate was delicious and they didn't scrimp on the portions, if you fancy a good greasy eat this is for you. So what do guys order when there being treated to pretty much free food?  Monster burgers apparently: ""A 12oz* burger heaped with crispy bacon, sliced Colby cheese, Cajun-battered onion rings and Friday's® mayo on a toasted seeded bun, with fresh cos lettuce, red onion and beef tomato. Served with extra Friday's® mayo""  Please don't sue me for copyright Mr TGI's lawyer. Sounds good, tasted great again the only fault I can make of this monstrosity was that either it or the starter was too big as I couldn't finish the beast, which was literally the size of my face.  As I said before not the biggest fan of TGI's but in general terms I think their chips could be up there with the best around, the saltiness, the crispyness and the little bit of skin left on makes them a real force to be reckoned with. Had several ultimate cocktails which certainly did the job as I stumbled out the place when we were done, they were delicious, not sure what they were but they were all different and all nice. All in all a great evening, we even tricked them into thinking it was one of our birthdays which lead to one slice of free cake and a long protracted happy birthday, followed by three cheers, followed by for he's a jolly good fellow, followed by some more cheering. The atmosphere in TGI's is great as dinners eat, drink and be merry.  While I think the food is overpriced, it is delicious and I think it is nice to come here every once in a while just to be reminded how a good chain works.  Those opposed to restaurant chains need not apply.   I definitely think the TGI's in Glasgow is the best in Scotland, but I can't claim to say that I've been in all the TGI's in Scotland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland
Nicola B.,"Fresno, CA",656,517,1232,3.0,12/9/2009,"In a nutshell, it's a poor man's Hard Rock Café. Very American dinery, with the ubiquitous bric-a-brac splashed across the walls and all the usual menu items. Burgers, bigger burgers, even bigger burgers, lots of plates with chips. Although the menu is actually quite extensive, I seem to find it impossible to order right. Everything is just a little bit more expensive than you'd like to pay, and never quite lives up to your expectations. If you're looking for the overpriced American-ish vibe, it's quite vibrant I suppose. They have a huge range of cocktails, which sound quite appealing but I've never quite trusted that they'd be better than any other bar in the area.

Let's start with the good first which was we got a table yay, everyone will know they are constantly busy and your lucky if you can walk up for a table. It took a while before we got asked for our drink request bit this was only an issue as I had a train to catch and didn't want a long winded affair. The longest wait was for our mains, none of us had ordered starters but for some reason it took ages. Once we got it my cheeseburger was cremated inc the cheese on top. I had two small pieces of onion and some white stuff under the cheese which I think was sour cream hmmm random. It was very dry and wouldn't get again. My mums meal was supposed to have mozzarella and she had two fingernail size pieces and that was it.

The food is only ever ok never excellent and the service can be slow. We waited 20 odd minutes to receive beers to the table on the last visit.  They have a large cocktail menu that seems quite overpriced. With the 2 sizes not exactly giving much value for money.  The service can be very hit and miss it depends who serves you. One visit the girl was lovely efficient and had a great attitude. The next visit the guy we had was terrible very disorganised slow and not particularly good at getting the right things to the right people.

Gavin M.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",112,1090,547,5.0,1/25/2010,"When looking for a place to review as a fitting end to my Yelp scouting odyssey, a restaurant that's seen as a tacky and faceless money machine may not be the obvious choice. However, I absolutely love TGI's, and will give it 5 stars any day of the week. It's the kind of place that won't often get glowing reviews, but usually just because people are afraid to admit they love it. I've eaten in plenty of good restaurants in different cities and countries, but quite simply, there are few meals in the world more satisfying than a half rack of ribs along with some blackened cajun chicken and a side of onion rings.  As someone with a penchant for late 80s / early 90s nostalgia, I wasn't too enthusiastic when I heard of it's recent refurbishment, but ended up pleasantly surprised by the (marginally) more understated look. They've also toned down the the all-singing all-dancing customer service ethos that was a bit old hat. I didn't mind it too much, but it did feel a bit awkward seeing the permanent forced smiles when deep down I knew that the next morning they'd wake up ashen-faced in their bedsits, up to their arses in final reminders. Anyway, along with the softening of the wackiness, they've returned the menu to it's vast and varied former glory, and to be honest I can't wait to work my way through it. From the potato skins to the milkshakes, it never fails to deliver, so sod what the neighbours think and give Fridays a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20

Devin M.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",41,65,12,2.0,8/17/2011,"""Meh"" sums up TGI Friday's for me perfectly.  I went here today to celebrate a friend's birthday and left just as underwhelmed as the last time I went to TGI's here.  My friend and I split a plate of chicken nachos which were nice, but nothing special, especially not for a tenner.  Ditto for the cajun chicken salad we shared; the lettuce was boring iceberg variety, there were far too many onions to cover up for the lack of flavor elsewhere and the presentation was rather dull - it just didn't feel like a dish that was worth £10. The service was friendly when we got it, but it felt like all the staff were stretched a bit thin today and it was hard to get the server's attention sometimes. TGI's isn't a HORRIBLE place, but it would never be my first choice when going out.  The reason I didn't give it three stars is because of the vast disparity between the price and quality of the food.  If the food were either better or cheaper, I might be more inclined to add on that third star.

Paige K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",39,52,,3.0,11/22/2011,"I get the feeling that TGI Fridays tries harder in the UK than it does in the US. Probably this is because it's one of a wide variety of similar chain venues Stateside, rather than a bit more iconic and representational of the dining genre as it is here. There's far cheerier waitstaff, somewhat better food, and I've managed not make jokes about 'flair'. Though our waiter had a LOT of 'flair'. But still, it's nothing new and for a higher price than I'd like to see--almost as if they converted dollar pricing into pounds and ran with it from there. Maybe that's because I've eaten at restaurants like this for my entire life, but it doesn't thrill me, and having to pay through the nose for it thrills me even less. If I want American food, there are better places to go with a bit less processed character and possibly even cheaper. They do have a good cocktail menu, though, if that is Your Thing.

Very Americana, with good music and ambience and lively waiting staff who in in this particular visit were great with my friends kid, making balloon animals and chatting everytime he walked past. My Mummy friend remarked when she used to live here she came here quite alot as they are one of the most family friendly joints in town.  The food came surprisingly quick relative to how busy it was, and we all lapped down every conceivable bite where I would have licked the plate if I was at home. My only qualm, is that some of the dishes are a little overpriced, where I would make comparisons to Frankie and Bennie's and Hard Rock Cafe once more, where the portions also rank in between those two joints as well (key = from smallest to largest). All things considered, the stellar service and visual eye candy all combine to form a great overall experience which I am happy to pay for. Get's busy, and is a better romp in the evening I suspect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
Em C.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",206,1185,783,4.0,7/5/2011,"After being at uni I have run out of words, so this will be a zingy literary experience, I'm sure. Didn't venture into TGI's that much until recently, which is surprising since it has existed on this street corner since the fourth of FOREVER. It's almost as old as me. Which brings me to my magical point... For people born in the year it was founded (1986), TGI's recently offered out 20 squidding quid's worth of chunky American grub. CHOW DOWN! I got a free flubbing burger the size of my face caked in guacamole, chewy bits of bacon, a tomato (slice of, not a whole one), melted cheeze and a light sprinkling of chilli's. Thank you, sir.  Rammed it down my throat and bloody enjoyed it. Makes turning 25 more bearable, I suppose. I could see the sea of almost ""auld yins"" around me, crying into cocktails served in what can only be described as fish bowls.  I am here to deliver the good news that yes, there is such a thing as a quarterlife crisis. Thankfully, TGI's not only have the remedy (in the form of burgers and free booze), but also have managed to steer clear of the disease. When they're not giving out a ridonkulous amount of free food they are the kind of overblown Americana establishment that makes me nostalgic for when me and mother used to go to Fatty Arbuckles. It's remained solidly 90s (to the point they were playing Nirvana and Skunk Anansie yesterday), with its crazy wooden walls, Tom Cruise barmen, guitars on the walls and shamelessly fast food. It's pays homage to the days before Mad Cow Disease, faddy eating and five a day, so for that level of escapism I can only be thankful. Good, honest burgers, tasty milkshakes and friendly staff, don't see the problem, myself!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
Darryl R.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",19,415,435,3.0,10/1/2009,"I don't know what happened to TGI's. It used to be an amazing place - or so it seemed. It's an old haunt of family meals - once a year, my sister's godparents take us shopping and then for a meal, and we always have, and always will come here. The number of times when we were younger that my parents made us pop the complimentary balloons for kids before getting in the car (they always skewed my dad's view... oopsie) is countless. We've lost  2 coats and a bag to this particular branch (plastic zippers on children's coats don't mix well with turned up/on radiators). I will always remember it fondly. Nowadays however, it doesn't seem to be all that amazing. Maybe the staff are less motivated, I don't know. It just seems to have lost its energy (again, this may have been from my age/lack of understanding). The food is still decent, if not a little expensive (the burgers and ribs are excellent), and now being old enough (har har) I can enjoy the wide selection of cocktails, which I can't really complain about (Strawberry Daiquiris.... yum!). It's busy so they're obviously still doing something right - yum yum yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
Maureen M.,"West Dunbartonshire, United Kingdom",6,414,403,3.0,3/12/2010,"TGI Friday is where me and my friends would go when were underage and couldn't get served alcohol anywhere else. It is pretty cheesy; the waiters' uniform consists of braces and baseball bats covered in badges. The food is really good American diner stuff, even if it is not cheap. TGIs is the perfect place for families so I have to applaud them for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
Paul C.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",4,700,747,2.0,4/2/2010,"In the twenty seven years I have lived in Glasgow I have set foot in this place maybe twice. I can see what TGI Friday's is trying to do but it is just not my cup of tea; too contrived ""wackiness"". Okay, it is good for families but there are plenty of eateries in Glasgow which are good for families and don't charge £15 for a burger.  Don't call me a snob because I have been known to be partial to a Hard Rock Cafe. But, like a previous reviewer said, TGI Friday's is a poor man's Hard Rock Cafe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
Adele R.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",75,451,1006,3.0,1/26/2010,"TGI's is full of super friendly waiting staff that are full of smiles and songs for their customers, which diners will either lap up gladly as they munch on burgers and sip on cocktails, however for some it's all a bit too much contrived cheer. What I do like about this place is their impressive cocktail and dessert menus, which offer a gorgeous selection of each and at times they are even combined! On my eighteenth birthday all those years ago, I enjoyed a big ice cream cocktail here that could easily have served three people and was a tipsy and tasty treat. What I did not enjoy was the fact that the staff and surrounding diners took it upon themselves to sing Happy Birthday to me very loudly, since my not so marvellous mother informed them that it was my birthday. Mortifying for me, but entertaining when it happens to someone at another table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
S T.,"North Lanarkshire, United Kingdom",89,1198,1191,4.0,4/21/2010,"You realise what a hit or a miss this place is if you visit it more than once in a 3 or 4 month time scale.  I really, really love TGI's and when it's good, it's exceptionally good. There is nothing better than a TGI lunch after a big night out on the lash, it's so filling and tasty, but for a romantic meal, it's pretty much out of the question. I usually get the mozzarella melts which come with a delicious tomatoey sauce and they have yet to disappoint me. Then I normally have the Jack Daniel's chicken with cheesy mash and broccoli which is simply divine. You can't get JD sauce like this anywhere else, and I would kill for that recipe. We are usually too full for dessert, I have had the popcorn and brownie sharing sundae which was lovely. It's always pricey, but we usually don't mind. The servers are bubbly and sometimes borderline irritating, but they probably get forced to be like that. I will also mention the huuuuge glasses of cocktails for around £7-8, a couple of those and it's bedtime for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
John M.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",0,79,2,1.0,11/20/2008,"I was a kid when this branch of TGI Fridays opened, in what is now an absolute prime location, on the corner of Gordon Street and Buchanan Street.  Though at the time Buchanan Street was a bit of a wilderness and half the buildings were empty, what is now Borders across the road from it was an office for RBS, however it has now evolved into Glasgow's main shopping thoroughfare.  When it opened it was a huge novelty, more of a proper restaurant than a McDonalds, of which there weren't that many at the time, and all that crazy crap hanging up on the walls what can I say and it probably helped that at the time I wasn't paying.  However as my cynical late twenties self would now say to the young Gohn, this place sucks.  The novelty can only take things so far; the American number plates and surfboards bolted to the wall only have so much appeal.  The last time I was there I had a burger and chips, sorry fries in the lingo, and it was unimpressive, dry and pretty poor quality for the price.  If you're an adult and want a good burger in a proper city center bar, go to Nice'n'Sleazys and have the sleazy burger. :oP",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
John M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",7,62,2,2.0,10/21/2008,"I always love the food here, however its over priced and the service is terrible.  I really want to like it since its in a decent location and do great ribs!  Unfortunately I have to advise people to avoid this place as the service completely ruins it (expect to be ignored for 30 minutes at a time). It took me 25 minutes last time to get my bill after asking for it twice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scotland?start=20
