Alexis S.,"Middleburg, FL",116,11,2,3.0,12/23/2016,"Love how late this place is open! Food is very average but always come here after dinner to get cheesecake to-go. Hershey's chocolate cheesecake is my go-to, soooo good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
Christine A.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,2.0,1/6/2017,I just left from the Cheesecake Factory and I'm very fair when it comes to writing a review. But I was very disappointed in my experience. We were sat right away which was awesome for a Friday night. Our waitress was nice but very very slow...drink refills had to be asked and then were even forgotten. Our meals were good and came out in a timely fashion but my alcohol drink was very weak. It was disappointing because the drink was actually tasty. There was just way to many waiters and waitress standing around together talking verse doing their job. The floors were extremely slippery as usual but with the rain I would of expected them to try and make it more safe. Sorry to write a crappy review but this place just isn't worth the money!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
Lisa G.,"Jacksonville, FL",80,12,29,5.0,4/27/2016,"I hadn't been here in a few years because last time I went the food was mediocre for a not so mediocre price. We got giftcard for my birthday so we figured we'd give it another shot. Suprisingly - EVERYTHING we had was good!! I had the crabcake balls for appetizer and, for entree, an Asian salad (forget the name), my husband had steak and we were very satisfied.. our waiter was amaaaaaazing!!!... definitely changed my mind!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
Laytan G.,"Jacksonville, FL",22,14,35,2.0,4/16/2016,"I'll start off by saying that I only ever go to the Cheesecake Factory if someone I'm with suggests it. Their menu is way too long and the food is very basic. I've been here several times and I've never been thrilled at the food or the service. It's all just ok... This time I got a Cesar salad and a margarita pizza. Neither were very good and both tasted bland.   The lighting is dim and the decor is very wannabe-fancy. People do come here a lot for special occasions so there's a lot of people dressed up but there's also plenty of people in cutoff jean shorts as well so I wouldn't say it's very classy.  The cheesecake is really good, and they're open really late at night so that's a plus. But honestly the food, wine and drinks are just so overpriced and not very good that I don't really like coming here. It's always really busy on the weekends and parking is a nightmare at the town center unless you wanna walk far or use the valet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
Kathleene C.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",3,27,21,4.0,10/13/2016,"OK I've eaten at the cheesecake factory before and I'm not impressed. The food is American cuisine  so they have most of people's favorites. I like the  strawberry cheesecake best. When I'm in the mood to adventure I try,  different flavors.

Cathrine C.,"Newport News, VA",389,343,506,4.0,1/29/2015,"I came here for my wedding reception and it was kind of a pain getting it set up, but they made it happen. We did their ""call ahead"" seating, which doesn't work like a reservation and you need at least 15 people in your party to be seated in a big space. WELL, in this case we had 25 and they made it work for us on a Saturday at 430pm (THANKS GUYS!!!!).  Everyone we said that was going to come, came. And it was wonderful. The customer service was great and they kept our tables full of food and our glasses of water, soda, and wine full. Appetizers and food came very fast. They may have been trying to get us to go, but we took our time, after all, my family did spend a lot of money there for everyone to eat.  I think heading OUT of the restaurant was the WORST. It's so packed and everyone is just standing inside waiting to get seated. It's a pretty noisy restaurant too, but it's because it's so open. I had a great time with good people and yummy food. I ordered the calamari, the BangBang Chicken and Shrimp (HUGE PORTION, good for like 3-4 people), and a pina colada - DELICIOUS. ALL OF IT, DELICIOUS.  I have never been let down by Cheescake Factory. Worth the wait for sure. Just shop around while you're waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
Patty G.,"Saint Johns, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/31/2016,"They make fantastic cheesecake but boy they make you work for it!  Can't find the line to stand in at the walk in counter to buy a slice or whole cake. Cashier just shouting for ""next customer"" and thereso many people waiting to be seated and waiting for "" to go orders"" there is zero organization to any form of a line.  Get your act together Cheesecake Factory. Your cake may be good but it's $7+ dollars a slice AND you have to fight your way through the line and pushed and shoved .  Maybe do your customers a favor and buy a stanchion or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
Ana N.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,31,14,2.0,9/20/2016,"I like the Cheesecake Factory but haven't been since I witnessed one of planet earth's oldest inhabitant (read: cockroach) crawl on the wall next to my table.

Lisa P.,"Jacksonville, FL",191,75,11,3.0,9/17/2016,"Had two polar opposite lunches here this past week. One on a non-busy Tuesday and the other on a much busier Friday. No problems with the first lunch, except maybe a while to get the check if I'm nitpicking. Food was delicious, full of flavor. Loved the ratatouille and broccoli sides specifically which had lots of garlic. Yum-o! They have a big healthy menu called Skinnylicious and mom I both had salads the vegetable one for me and the chopped Cobb for her. Both were really good and full of vegetables and toppings abd almost more stuff in the salad the lettuce. On Friday I ordered the same thing and noticed there were very little vegetables in my vegetable salad mostly lettuce. When I told the waitress she said ""oh I can bring you some on the side"". Also had the salad drenched in salad dressing which I had clearly ordered on side and the waitress had repeated it back to me. When I asked the waitress to take it back she rolled her eyes at me. Sorry that would warrant a 1 star rating from me automatically but based on the great lunch Tuesday I averaged the stars. Maybe it was an off day, but I don't really think being busy is an excuse for bad service. Also noticed how the broccoli came out almost raw Friday and completely plain with no garlic nothing. It didn't taste very good and almost broke a tooth trying to chew it. I hate sending food back so I ate it, but come on some constancy would be great. I think it's more of a kitchen issue then waitress issue, but rolling eyes is a big no no.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
James G.,"Jacksonville, FL",21,70,91,3.0,2/2/2016,"An exceeding average and commercialized restaurant. My partner and I decided this would be a great last minute supper location. We were seated quickly, but at the smallest table for two I've ever seen. With less than two feet between tables, it was very awkward sitting down. The other side effect of packing in customers is the noise level makes it hard to have conversations. It was disappointing. It took awhile using their weird lengthy menu, flipping through alternating advertisements and menu items. I feel the ""healthy"" items are unnecessary, no one comes to The Cheese Cake Factory to eat healthy. The extra dishes just bloat the menu even more. I suppose they couldn't cram as many customers in if they didn't try to appeal to everyone. Not even going to comment on the décor. Ordered Buffalo Blasts®, which is blobs of buffalo chicken dip battered and fried. They were actually very good and plenty for two people. For my main dish, Pasta With Chicken And Scampi Sauce, it was delicious. Garlic, cream, and pasta! I was hooked as soon as I read it.  Although I admit the food is good, it doesn't make up for a disappointing dining experience. The dinning room was clean, as well the restroom. The staff friendly and efficient. This could have been great, but they sacrifice customer experience for profits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
Liz C.,"Honolulu, HI",2,41,,2.0,2/29/2016,"There was a lot wrong with our visit. For a 100$ minimum meal for 2 people this place was so lame considering you can go to Moxie. Seating: They at first sat us at the smallest tiniest table width wise, and really far length wise. I couldn't hear what my bf was saying across from me, and I was closer to the person next to me than I was to him. I'd rather talk to my date than a random stranger at a nice dinner, so we asked to move. Drinks: We ordered an extra dirty martini. When it arrived, it didn't have any olives in it, so I sent it back to get olives. I feel that this is just common bartending knowledge. I've never gotten a dirty martini that didn't come with olives! Was it just that the bartender didn't care? When it came back I found that it wasn't dirty at all. I sent it back again and it was barely dirty but I didn't feel like sending it back a third time. I feel that to a restaurant that is this expensive and claims to have a bar that an extra dirty martini shouldn't be this complicated. I could have made it better myself and gotten it right the first time. An extra dirty martini shouldn't have to be sent back three times. It is a very simple drink to make. Food: My food, the farfalle pasta with chicken, tasted exactly like the premade frozen bags of pasta in the freezer section. The pasta was undercooked and hard. The sauce came out of a bag. I didn't even want the leftovers. My bf wanted something that wasn't on the menu exactly which threw the kitchen into a loop. We wanted pasta, but wanted some steak chopped on top of it. We were willing to pay for both the pasta dish and the steak separately. Our waiter asked the kitchen if they could do this, but they were too corporate. They couldn't present the dish other than it usually made because it would mess up the plating. To me, that's stupid. So they gave us the steak separate and we had to cut it up ourselves and put it on top of the pasta. I feel that the kitchen could have done this. It wasn't that complicated. Not a big deal but still. Service: Our server was great, two stars are for him! He was only hindered but the lack of drink making skills of the bartender. And the cheesecake was delicious as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80
M O.,"Bellingham, WA",0,9,2,1.0,5/28/2017,"I have never had a bad experience at this place, and I have been to Vegas, Seattle, and many more along the way. This had to have been the WORST experience with out to eat I have had, and mainly because of how the issue was handled. I ordered salmon, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Very simple. My husband had the same with chicken. We assumed that waiting for his chicken, they sat out asparagus and potatoes aside, with my fish, and then finally got his chicken ready. My potatoes were stiff to the point that my fork kind of stuck. I thought it was pretty cold but said oh well let's try the fish. It was also-cold! Not just like warm, cold. I politely asked the server about this and said it was really cold, no problem, just wanted it hot. He brought it back with a scalding hot plate, and mildly luke fish. Potatoes were Luke, and still the same now reheated old mash. How hard would a new scoop of mash have been? I said no I didn't want anything else as it was late and he said ok, left, and hardly offered a piece of bread. Coming by later, asked again about how things were and I thought really? I just sat and watched my husband eat...you could have offered a cracker! I asked my husband to pay while I spoke to the manager, as I did not want a free meal or coupon, and the manager clearly is not going to do anything other than listen to my gripe. I ordered my cheesecake and went on my way, which again, dissatisfaction. Melted merengue! What a joke. I have never been so insulted and quite frankly have never had to return a dish of food. Very insulted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=80

The waiter/waitress are normally pretty good.  I know they don't take reservation,  but the earlier you go the better chance you have not to wait. Like I mention earlier in normally go at lunch which the prices are decent, because you can get lunch size portions.  Dinner in would recommend you bring your wallet/ purse.

Obviously, have to try the cheesecakes.  I've tried a number of different ones and they are pretty darn tasty.  I love the fact that they have the skinnylicious menu because it doesn't have as much fat, butter, etc...and I know exactly how many calories I'm sucking down before I can get dessert ;) The staff has been friendly and the servers as well, although they do take a bit of time to bring your drinks and orders, even when it's not busy.  I've been to this location approximately 4 times and it's always the same.

Danielle C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",478,233,88,3.0,8/24/2014,"I hae been to this location a couple of times now when I go to visit friends in Jax.  The first time I went I sat at the bar and just add some small bites. I also downed about 2 delicious frozen bellinis. Service was decent. They were pretty dead that afternoon. I think the staff was pretty bored, so they weren't too attentive. But my water got filled up every time it was half full!  I did go here for brunch on Father's Day. Why? Well, because I wasn't home for Father's Day, and we were hungover and wanted foooooood! This trip was less enjoyable.  We had to wait to be seated for about 15 minutes--which was fine. We got there right there right when they opened, so the got a bit rushed. Once seated, however, we had to wait for about 30 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order. He was nice, but couldn't handle the amount of tables he had and seemed completely overwhelmed.  We got our drinks, but it was difficult to get refills. After ordering, our food took awhile. So we gobbled down 2 servings of bread. I had just ordered some eggs, bacon, and potatoes. It was decent, but the potatoes were TOTALLY overcooked.  Basically, getting anything extra from our waiter was incredibly difficult and after awhile we just gave up.  I understand it was a Holiday and they were busy, but a chain like this should plan better for these instances. I have gone to better locations in Miami (shocker). Also, the restaurant was not very clean. The floors looked like they hadn't been swept or mopped all weekend.....which is strange because they had just opened when we got there.

Kimberly M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,6/7/2015,"I experienced some terrible service from this bartender at the Jacksonville, FL,  Town Center location named Wagner.  He was rude and insisted that I  pay for an unfinished drink prior to going to the restroom,  as me and the 20+ members of my family waited to be seated...just because I am an African American male. Ironically enough, the white guy sitting next to me left and returned from the restroom and nothing was said. The manager condoned his behavior by confirming that this is their practice, but does this practice only apply to Blacks? If my twin niece and nephew hadn't been celebrating their high school graduation and so many family members weren't there, not only would I have lost my cool on this Wagner dude, but I would've refused to eat there.

I never choose to dine here, but if someone else chooses to go here, I will go along. We tried the meatloaf which was great but the mashed potatoes and gravy was the clear winner on the plate.

Erik C.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,35,3,2.0,3/23/2015,"My wife and I have been here twice and both times, we have not been impressed. First off the menu, decor and cheese cake are great. The problems are elsewhere.  Don't bother coming here on a Friday or Saturday because you will wait hours for a seat. The place is as loud as a school cafeteria on these nights so conversation is not a easy thing.  Service is a little slow (Monday) and dispute them messing up my drink, the waiter laugh without even asking to fix it.  The food is not all that good, at least what we ordered both times were not and my steak was burnt black on the outside and underdone on the inside. I asked if they had sauce like cream of mushroom or brandy sauce to top my steak with and the waiter snarled and said ""properly cook steaks don't need a sauce to make them taste good"". Strange, most high end restaurants with chefs cooking, prepare steak with sauces!  My ribbye was served with single side of French fries.... Nothing screams classy, like fries with your steak and no other sides. I substituted them for mash and was charged 3$ without them telling me. Mash was blane with no flavor at all.  I ordered a few drinks at 12.50 each which my same drink at a high end place only cost 10.50.  Tab came out to 105.00 in the end.

And I got the Steak Diane. It was cooked perfectly to my liking and the sauce it comes with is amazing! Definitely recommend this dish!

The last 2 times, we were given the wrong food completely.  This last time we ordered 3 meals and some cheesecake  to go and a salad while we waited.  The salad was great. The food on the other hand was misplaced and took over 30 mins to come out after 2 different people went to check on it. I think management needs to step it up on this. A manager walked by us 6 times stopping to watch the football game on the tv. Maybe they should have been doing a little more to make sure the right food or any food got to the customers.  The food ended up being cooked wrong.

After our young son ate some of his macaroni and cheese we found what appeared to be blue chewing gum in his food. We alerted the waitress who got the attention of the manager on staff this evening. He came to our table and said that hey had nothing of that texture in his restaurant and that perhaps our children had candy at the table that might have gotten into his food. After explaining to him that that was definitely not the case, he insisted that no one in his kitchen would have been chewing gum and that he was dumbfounded at what we found in our the food. He suggested that perhaps it was the packaging plant for the pasta even, anything to avoid taking responsibility for what was clearly the fault of someone in his kitchen. After taking my son's meal off the check, I paid the balance and left in literal disgust. We have eaten many times at this same establishment and cannot believe what we just experienced.

My Steak Diane was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I have a great deal of respect for any chef who can season *AND* cook meat to such a high degree of accuracy (As a scientist, I was hypothesizing how I might be able to measure the concentration ratio of salt to meat to achieve such a perfect balance, and then if that formula could be extrapolated to ANY meat, or just with beef???)  I tasted the ""Chicken and Biscuits"" that my companion ordered and it was served with the most savory and delicious gravy I've ever had in my life.

The waitress pushed for us to eat or take home the restaurant's legendary cheesecake, which we didn't, but I cannot blame her for trying. On a different day, I went to this cheesecake factory and bought a cheesecake and it was wonderful.

My favorite is the shrimp scampi, it's garlicky heaven with a side of angel hair pasta.   Our waitress was attentive but very busy...it was jam packed in there.  What I appreciated was that although they were really busy, all of the wait staff and bus boys were smiling and seemed to enjoy doing their jobs.  Usually a sign of a well run restaurant.  And although it was busy and the wait was long, we did not feel rushed to get through our meal.

Matt S.,"St. Augustine, FL",63,515,58,5.0,4/27/2010,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. It seems that every time you bring up the name of the place to any of your friends or relatives, they all just gasp with excitement at the thought of eating at this delicious restaurant. This particular TCF is located at the St. Johns Town Center, and there is usually plenty of parking within the immediate area, although since it is in a mall, if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to walk for a bit, unless you go with the valet parking. The decor of the place is great, and I love how the restaurant is WIDE OPEN, although the tables and booths are somewhat close together, but it feels very relaxed and inviting. You can sit inside, at the bar, or they have tables outside, usually with large tiki torches lit and heaters above your tables for chilly nights. The few times I have been here, I did not have to wait to get a table, but if you do show up on busier nights / afternoons, be prepared to wait, and wait a little while. The service is actually fantastic here. The servers here only have 3-4 tables max at one time, so that ensures that they will be at your table more often than not, making sure your food comes out at a good pace, that your drinks are filled, and that you have everything you need. I legitimately have not had bad service at a Cheesecake Factory, EVER, which is quite an accomplishment. Now we get to the food.... Wow. It does seem like a lot of the menu items are hit or miss. The great thing is that there is such a diversity in what you can order, whatever you're in the mood for, it's there. Feeling like a thick, juicy burger? Check. Seafood or pasta? Check. Classic comfort food? Check. It's all here. Some of the items on the menu just won't suit everyone's taste buds, so be sure to thoroughly look over the menu to decide what you really want, and you will walk away a winner. There are so many fantastic dishes, it's really hard to decide. Last time I was in I had a black and bleu burger and it flat-out kicked ass. With such great service and great food, what else could you ask for? Oh yeah, CHEESECAKE! I always liked Jimmy's line on ""Yes, Dear"", when he expected to walk in and see Cheesecakes being built and traveling around on conveyer belts, which you won't see here. But it is the first thing you will notice walking in, a HUGE case filled with delicious cheesecakes right next to the seats in the lobby. I believe it takes up two pages in the menu, if I'm not mistaken... There are so many unbelievably delicious choices, it is near impossible to choose. I also usually order so much food I can never have room at the end. Well I'm telling you- MAKE ROOM. The key lime was un-f'n-believable. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake will bring you to your knees.  Overall, I really enjoy this place... I don't know too many people, if any, who DON'T like eating here. I highly recommend it to anyone, it's a great family place, or great to take a date.

Christina S.,"New Orleans, LA",2,27,3,5.0,3/25/2011,"I'm pretty sure that The Cheesecake Factory is in my top 3 for the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. The interior is so unique and lovely that it almost makes you feel like you are in an art museum. It makes for a really fun atmosphere. I usually like to start off with some of their great drinks. The strawberry lemonade is excellent, but I don't order it very often because anyone can easily succumb to a sugar coma after a glass or two. The passion fruit tea is pretty good, too, with a hint of fruit in it. I think you can purchase it from them, but I'm not sure on that. It's good enough to make at home in my opinion.  If you are ordering an appetizer, order the avocado eggrolls. They are amazing, AMAZING. It can easily be served as an entree. Trust me, I will not steer you wrong. The sauce that comes with it is so good. Try them! Entrees I have tried recently are: Fish tacos- They are ok, nothing that I would order again. I'm not that crazy about corn tortillas, though. If you like them, you may like these. Miso salmon- Out of this world! I've tried to duplicate it at home, and it never turns out like theirs. It's a bit expensive, so it usually becomes the ""birthday meal"" for me when I go around that time. Roasted vegetables and goat cheese pizza- It's great to order when you are in the mood for pizza. I recommend! Obviously, most people go for their desserts...cheescake! I have tried a bunch of them over the years, and I recommend all of them. My favorite would have to be a 3-way tie between tiramisu, chocolate raspberry, and Godiva chocolate. Trying a slice of cheesecake is pretty mandatory there. It's the only time I ever actually order dessert from any restaurant. Oh yeah, the whipped cream that they dollop beside every cheesecake is the best I have ever had, ever.

Eugene P.,"Santa Clara, CA",15,216,144,4.0,4/23/2010,"We typically go here here a few times especially if we are craving cheesecake or desserts.  It seems that their menu has changed since we were last there.  They added quite a bit more and can get a bit overwhelming.  You really have to make reservations or give yourself 30-45 mins ahead of time, especially during peak hours.  We usually drop our name and then go shopping.  We went during lunch about 30 mins before noon so we got a seat in 10 mins. The inside is quiet large and several table where you can line up to accommodate a large party.  They also have outdoor seating which unfortunately can be extremely bright during lunch.  Typically outdoor seating is faster than indoor but I'm sure you can guess why. We started with the tex mex eggrolls.  To be honest it isn't AS good as the bang bang chicken and shrimp but close.  If you can't take spicy then this is a great appetizer to get. For an entree I got the cashew chicken salad which a decent size.  It can come in both lunch and dinner portions.  The lunch size was plenty for me.  I was going to get the tostada salad but unfortunately they do not serve lunch portions.  The grilled chicken tostada salad is HUGE by the way.  The other entree was the chicken enchilada.  The sauce was really good.  I can't remember if this comes as a lunch special/portion but it was the same price as the salad. We finished off with the mango key lime and Stefanies red velvet cheesecake.   To be honest the red velvet cheesecake is a little overrated because the cake is slightly stiff.  The trick is to order it take out and let it sit for 15-30 mins.  It melts in your mouth after you do that. The food is good, the desserts are good, the drinks are good, the price is a little on the higher side (but expected), and its at a good location.  The only downside is the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=240

Alen L.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,25,,5.0,2/21/2009,"I'm shocked no one had reviewed The Cheesecake Factory yet. Located in the heart of the St. John's Town Center, it's a very popular spot to stop by for dinner and/or dessert and is typically extremely busy in the evening. Though I've had their cheesecake before, tonight was the first time I ate dinner there. We ate outside, where it was certainly less noisy and busy than inside. Though it was a bit chilly, the patio was heated, which was definitely a nice touch. The service was solid, especially when you consider that the waiter was obviously having a very long time and seemed ready to collapse at any moment. What amazes me about Cheesecake Factory is the sheer size of its menu. In addition to their beers, wines, and cocktails (which I didn't even look at since I don't drink), they serve a variety of dishes, ranging from hamburgers and pizza to your typical Italian fare, oriental pasta, seafood, and steak. With such a hodgepodge menu, I wasn't sure what to expect about the quality of the food. But my misgivings were soon alleviated. For the appetizer, we ordered the Crispy Crab Wantons (you might know this as crab rangoon). This dish absolutely blew me away. The breading was delicate and fluffy, the crab meat was creamy and practically melted in your mouth, and the accompanying sauce was a perfect compliment to the meat. As hard as it was to choose a main course, I decided to stick with another oriental dish and ordered the Thai Chicken Pasta. Again, I'd say that I made a good choice. It consisted of linguini tossed with sauteed chicken and topped with plenty of vegetables and a hot peanut sauce. The pasta was of the perfect consistency and the chicken was delicious. There was also plenty of it; I took home a little less than half of the dish and will be having it for lunch tomorrow. For desert, I got the Tiramisu Cheesecake. This blend of a traditional Italian custard and fluffy cheesecake served with whipped cream on the side was wonderful and a nice deviation from the norm. Overall, a wonderful experience. An appetizer, dinner for 2, desserts, tax and tip came out to $70.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=240

I also ordered coffee and a diet coke. Coffee came, no coke. I didn't even bother asking because they think they're ssooo with it by not writing anything down. Asked for salt - don't bother- it's like they poured water in there with it. It all comes down to management not  being on top of things.

They brought me just a plain burger on a buttered bun (really? why do I need butter with a hamburger? America, man.) and plain salad.

Incredibly GINORMOUS menu with a 4-5 star twist on your favorites.  Altho this is a chain store you will find no matter what state you're in the Cheesecake factory has high standards, great service and a very courteous staff. We've been to ones in Oklahoma City and near Dayton and have not been disappointed at all.  Try the ahi carpaccio for an appetizer. It's a thinly sliced ahi tartar with a wasabi pesto, creamy avocado and togarashi aiolo. Mmmmmm!!! One of our favs is the fried macaroni and cheese - a crunchy fried breading on the outside with a creamy mac & cheese center  4 larger than golfball sized delights sitting on top of a light tomato saucy pesto. The Kobe burgers are soooo tender! Daughter and I have ordered the fried mac & cheese and kobe burgers and split both so we'd have enough room left for cheesecake later.  The miso salmon is my fav - sweet miso glazed salmon placed on top of an island of white rice decorated with snow peas and dots of miso sauce circling another creamy pool of white sauce. Awesome and light! Ask for a lunch portion. Or if you're famished ask for the dinner portion. Hubby ordered a seared tuna tataki salad  which is seared albacore tuna served rare with avocado, tomatoes and mixed greens  with a wasabi vinegarette. Mmmmmm!   Always a pleasure to rubberneck as wait staff quickly sweep by with armfulls of piled high salads and meals and ""just rub on your thigh"" cheesecakes topped with billowy whipped cream. And speaking of cheesecake, take your pick of 35 spectacular flavors! Favs are Godiva cheesecake, tuxedo, white choco macadamia and Choco peanut butter cookie dough!

I'm not a big fan of TCF but I will endure it for her. So we get there and park nowhere near the enterance, but maybe a 15 minute walk away which is not bad for the Town Center. We finally fight our way to the hostess booth (like salmon fighting to get upstream) and are told its a 45 minute wait. Now I usually don't hardly ever wait but ""somebody"" who shall remain nameless gave me a look that said ""Were Waiting"" so we waited. Went into the bar area and actually found 2 seats at the bar next to each olther and ordered drinks, A Mai Tai for the missus and a craft beer for me. I was then informed that TCF doesn't have any craft beers on tap or anywhere. The bartender said that the closet they had was a Sierra Nevada which didn't taste too bad, but still not what I really wanted. The tab for that was $17 which to me is ridiculous for 1 Mai Tai and an average bottled beer. Finally 1/2 hr later our pager goes off and were lead to a really small table in the back and wait for our server, (who was fantastic BTW) and ordered 2 iced teas and an order of Onion rings to munch on. Along with my wifes Chicken Maderia  and my (server recommended) Mahi Mediterrainian, The Onion rings arrived and truth be told they were the best Onion Rings I have ever eaten, I just wish they had some/any sauce that accompanied them other than catsup, like most other places do. The food arrives in a timely manner and it's, it's uasual great tasting self. Then my wife gets a Vanilla Bean slice of Cheesecake and some hot fudge on the side and immediately slips into her ""I am now officially happy mode"" and everything is all right with the world in general.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=200

This location was nestled in to a high end shopping center with a nice patio. It was an amazing 74 degrees on this October day when a friend and I enjoyed our lunch outside. The Good --- Hostess was friendly and was spot on for how long of a wait we had. She told us 8 mins tops and well I kinda laughed with my buddy and ...8 mins later we were seated. Nothing worse than walking into a place and being told it will only be a couple mins....20 mins later your still waiting. So very good job Cheesecake factory. Food is always great. I have ordered many things and I still have not found anything I dont like. This day I had the Steak Diane and Shrimp scampi combo and my friend had the chicken medeira. Both meals were Hot and tasty.  The OK ---- Waitress was friendly, but with that said... we hardly ever saw her. My buddy could of used a refill a couple times and I was drinking  a Large Blue Moon, so I decided to sip slowly because I didnt want to be out of a drink. Maybe it was because we were on the patio...Not sure. Also, when the food came ....the little extras that one would request were not able to....for at least 5mins into having the food. It was dropped off my kitchen helper? waitress was MIA. The Bad---- Only thing I think is bad about this place is the temptation to have some cheesecake...lol God knows Its not in my diet....got 10lbs more to lose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=200

Unfortantely, I just cannot get a decent entree at CF. My wife waited over 30 minutes for a burger! We were informed it was overcooked, but  once her's arrived it was super rare. The accompanying fries and my New Orleans shrimp entree must have sat waiting under heat lamps while the cook attempted to fail at making a freaking burger.

The new restaurants haven't taken a toll on business at Cheesecake- business is still booming. I ordered an appetizer of fried zucchini with ranch dipping sauce. Extraordinary in every way. The zucchini was hot and fresh, and the ranch has a hint of garlic- yum. At $6.50, they are a bargain. They have a new Korean cauliflower app we were excited to try but they were out of it unfortunately. I settled with the Santa Fe salad with chicken, black beans, cheese, corn, tomatoes, fresh cilantro, romaine and tortilla strips. It comes with a cilantro peanut vinaigrette. I'm glad I got it on the side- definitely not to my liking. I opted for more of that yummy garlic ranch and- boom! Outstanding salad!

We went on a Wednesday night @6. 20 min wait, which is not unusual. When we were seated I was a little taken back by all the empty seats.  Then we are seated almost on top of a family with kids.  Now it's not the restaurants fault that the kids were unruly, jumping around and kept hitting us, but there were plenty of other open tables we could have been seated at. When the waitress finally came, which took a while, we were ready to order drinks. When she came back we ordered fried mac and cheese. The appetizer came before the drinks. The mac and cheese is always good. I ordered the sweet corn tamales, which were ok.  Corn flavor but not much else. My daughter ordered the steak and cheese, which she enjoyed. I normally love the miso salmon but I decided to try something else this time and wouldn't order it again. There are a lot of other restaurants in the area that I would try before coming back.

The second time I went expecting the same thing it was absolutely horrible and I sent it back which I never do. I didn't have a big problem with our waiter but my daughter had to ask for things multiple times and that was a little frustrating as she won't need it until it's exactly the way she wants it.

We ordered a cheese pizza for our son and I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club while my husband ordered the regular club.  They brought our son's pizza first which I appreciated. More restaurants should do this. Kids aren't patient and they also eat slower from my experience than adults. I took a bite of the pizza and it was very good.

Quality has to suffer somewhere - Menu provides calories for each meal - kinda makes you feel guilty to order anything to eat. I saw some menu items with close to 2000 calories - that's a day's worth of food - They do have a skinny menu and that's a good thing - better portion control - Location/parking - being that I'm not a big fan of the Town Center set up - I get it, I'm not their target demographic - I don't really enjoy coming any where near this shopping center. - The biggest issue I have is they don't take reservations! I get it as this place doesn't need to. For a random Tuesday evening, this place was steadily full. Our quoted 20 minute wait ended up being 5 minutes so that was a big plus.

She loves cheesecakes so this was the place she picked for her birthday dinner.  When I did carryout, it was usually in the late evenings and I thought to myself, when I this place never packed? Apparently around 5 pm. We were able to get a table with no problems. Even when we left at 6 something, it wasn't busy. Probably avoid late evenings or weekends to avoid the crowd. Their menu is large, perhaps too big. It's hard for an indecisive person like myself to pick. I ended up ordering the Santa Fe salad. It was good and huge. I was only able to eat half of it. Wished I had requested the dressing on the side bc everything was coated with the vinaigrette. My oldest ordered the pasta carbonara and hubby ordered the shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo. Both were delicious. The birthday girl ordered a spaghetti and meatball from the kids menu but barely touched it, she was probably only there for the dessert.  Their cheesecakes are good but can be super rich. Their red velvet, original with strawberry, and white chocolate and raspberry truffle are probably my favorites. My daughter picked the oreo dream extreme cheesecake and that was way too rich. They do not offer complimentary birthday desserts, but did write Happy Birthday on the cheesecake, put a candle on it and sang to which was nice.  I purchased a $25 giftcard during the Holidays and received two ""slice of joy"" certificates for cheesecakes which was a really good deal considering the cost of cheesecake is around $8. Seems like they run this promo annually.  Prices are moderate but portions are fairly large depending on what you order. Service was really good. I didn't realize they have a brunch menu and would go back to give it a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville
Jeff W.,"Jacksonville, FL",63,144,369,4.0,1/15/2017,Not bad we come here often and really don't have any issues most the time. I usually stick with several options here the chicken parm sandwich or the Louisiana chicken pasta. My wife tried the chicken carbonara which was good the chicken in it was bland but the rest of the dish will make you feel like you ate a bulb of garlic. That and the bacon over powered the dish itself I would say less garlic and bacon and season the chicken better.      Service is never a problem they are attentive. This place is always an option for lunch or dinner. But I'll stick to what I know is good here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville

Make sure your entire party is present or they will just leave them out all together. Most of the staff is helpful and friendly. However, there is a female working the hostess station that is unpleasant. I've had a run in with her before and she did a good job of keeping her name out of the mix. Asked for a manager only to be given a business card. If you have a terrible experience before getting seated, then it's not going to be a good time. I left with my family because she refused to seat us. We were meeting a large group for a birthday. We specifically told them we would join them for dessert. The party made room for us, but the hostess insisted that we cannot be seated or served along with them. She didn't offer a solution even though the table next to our party even watched the event and offered us their table as they were finished. Being thoroughly upset, we opted to leave in which she was more than happy to smile and say bye in the most condicending way.  I will not return to this location. They really do not care for your business as there are people lined up out the door anyway. It's sad really, because my son really likes it there. I've been to other locations where we've had a wonderful time and the staff has been amazing. Luckily there are tons of other options. No one should be treated like this anywhere.

The menu is absolutely gigantic so there is bound to be something for everyone which is great. I have never had the cheesecake as I am lactose intolerant but it of course always looks amazing and hurts my stomach just thinking of it.  They have a bar area which really needs to be larger but has an extensive offering just like the menu and desserts.  The service had been good each time. If you go for dinner though, expect a wait. Sometimes you can get seated faster if you want to sit outside. On colder nights they do have the heaters on which on a night like my last visit (it was in he 50's) it made it nicer but hot tea was still required!

Alexandra M.,"Jacksonville, FL",60,104,494,3.0,10/2/2016,"I rarely come here just because of the crowds. The atmosphere is great, the waitress and waiters are normally very nice and helpful. My last experience here wasn't as great.  We got seated in a tiny nook at the back of the restaurant, which normally would be great but not this time.  Our waiter started the evening by stating he was leaving soon and someone would be taking his place, then proceeded to try to rush us to order, maybe so he wouldn't have to come back?  We placed our drinks and ordered two apps, the fried mushrooms turned into an argument- he said just mushrooms and not avocado and zucchini with it wasn't allowed. You had to get a mix of all three. Well my friend had ordered just the mushrooms multiple times before with no issue.  A whole later or drinks came out and there was something floating in mine, we had to wait about 15 minutes for him to come back.  At this time we managed to order with him and beg for bread for about the 3rd time. (Normally it's brought out)  FINALLY his relief came, she was awesome. Continuously checked on us, packed our food up and brought cheesecake. All in a timely manner.  I understand you're getting off work and you won't be receiving a tip from the tables around us, BUT you choose to be a waiter- suck it up and work like you would be receiving a tip until your relief shows up. Otherwise change jobs... The fried cheese was delicious and so was the fried mushrooms!  I had the orange chicken, I wasn't a fan of honestly and my friend had the crusted chicken breast with mashed potatoes.

If the review was based strictly on the cheesecake itself than yes I would give at least 4 stars because it is delish! Pricey but delish! As far as the food, I have yet to leave impressed. The last time I came to Cheesecake Factory I ordered buffalo chicken strips off the appetizers for $10 and they tasted like frozen, heavily breaded chicken tenders. I also got an angry orchard cider and with tip it was right over $20. Just seems pricey for the quality of food you receive. I have also had several of the specialty cocktails which are also very good but again expect to pay $10-$12.  For two people, with an appetizer, 2 entrees, a dessert and a few cocktails be prepared to spend well over $100.

Ralph S.,"Miramar Beach, FL",33,342,542,4.0,6/18/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant. I have eaten in them from one side of the country to the other. The menus are not unique in each restaurant so when going to one of their locations, one can be quite certain the dishes that will be available. So, while there is less drama or concern about a restaurant one may have when going to a mom and pop restaurant in a strip shopping mall, the chain is successful for a reason. The food is very good, there is a long menu and their desserts are hard to resist. On our latest visit to a Cheesecake Factory in Jacksonville, FL, I opted for a pasta dish with angel hair pasta, shrimp with garlic and on a bed of asparagus. The pasta was perfect. The shrimp were very flavorful and also cooked perfectly. I even liked the asparagus which is not often a dish that I favor.  My dining companion has a flatbread margherita dish that would pass for a margherita pizza in many restaurants but it is not as thick. I was not offered any of the dish so I cannot speak from personal experience but my lack of tasting opportunity was due to the fact it was very good and she wanted to eat all of it herself. I like the low calorie menu options that are available for those who care about such things while eating at a restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory. Options are good and I usually order off of this menu although sometimes I will finish the meal with a piece of the red velvet cheesecake. If I were in therapy, no doubt the psychologist would make something out of this foible. There are about 40 different flavors of cheesecake that will either appeal to everyone or generate stomach problems when thinking about the possibility of consuming so many calories at one meal.  I have never had a piece of any of the options that I did not like. Enjoy the dessert and plan on hitting the gym shortly. There is a good wine list at the Cheesecake Factory as well. It is not one that would put a good Italian restaurant to shame but still there are plenty of choices and the prices are reasonable. I like the restaurant. I still do not understand the decor. It looks like a large bar and dining area sitting inside of an Egyptian pyramid. Interesting and good conversation piece with no apparent reason for the selection. Anyone eating here could be forgiven for thinking they are on a movie set playing the role of a movie extra chowing down a large meal topped off with a large piece of cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is worth a trip. Not very expensive for the quality of the food and portion sizes served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=40

My key dish at this place has been the Hibachi steak for quite some time.  I've had it in so many places now I've lost count.  It's made just as good here as just about any other place I've had it.   The service again just like all the other restaurants in this golden standard of chains is just as good.  I can't say I've ever been disappointed at the food or service at any Cheesecake Factory, this one included. Being in the Town Center there's a lot of choices to eat here but to me, TCF is one of those staples that I'm happy to have at just about every higher end shopping center in every city (Tyson's Corner VA, Aventura FL, Galleria in Buffalo NY, John Hancock Center in Chicago etc). While the bread is good, it's a trap.  Don't get full from it.  The appetizers are huge so share if you even consider getting it.  Don't be greedy on your main because you can take it with you if you want to leave room for dessert and if you don't leave room just get a slice of one of the many cheesecakes to go.  Options... use them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=20

Some of my favorite dishes are the jambalaya over rice and the steak Diane / chicken Madeira combination entree. I have dabbled into other dishes from time to time like the enchiladas or the meatloaf, but the ones I mentioned before are my go to meals. The entrees all range from not so great to really freakin good, but because of that broad range of quality between dishes I sometimes leave unsatisfied. Now this isn't saying you can't find your perfect entree among the 20 page menu, I would be impressed if you can't find something you like.  The menu is the standout feature of cheesecake just because there is almost too much to choose from and if you end up getting past their massive entrees, you have two pages of cheesecake flavors to choose from. The cheesecake is also perfect every time. I'm not a big sweets type of guy, but their cheesecake is actually a great way to end a meal.  The decor is really nice with a huge painted ceiling and romantic lighting. The service is mostly top notch and I can't recall a bad experience.

While on the pricey side I would definitely say that The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite go to restaurant. Whether I want comfort food or healthier options I know they have what I'm looking for. It may take you a while to find parking or some time to get seated but once you're in it'll all be worth it.  They may be famous for their nice and creamy Cheesecake but I must admit the cooks know their way around a bacon cheese burger. That first bite just melts away all cares in the world and your only focus is savoring the flavor of their juicy burger.  Don't even get me started on their Steaks. Regardless of how you like your steaks cooked I would definitely say that you won't be disappointed. Every bite is like a party on your taste buds.  My favorite Cheesecake will have to be the original and of course the Turtle Cheesecake. Every bite melts away all worries and doesn't make you feel bad about those extra pounds you're trying to work off.

I don't understand why he was even stopped, we were all waiting together and he walked in with me when we put our name on the list. It was extremely unprofessional. Our server was great and attentive even with them being extremely busy. The appetizer was amazing and our food came out hot and was delicious. Our server topped our dishes off with fresh cheese. He kept our drinks topped off and we got our cheesecake slices in a timely manner to go with our checks.  The Cheesecake Factory is my boyfriend's favorite restaurant and we really were taken aback by the manager stopping our friend on the way to be seated, we have never experienced something like this when going out with friends and having an odd number.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=20
Your Worst Nightmare ..,"Jacksonville, FL",10,59,7,5.0,7/9/2017,Its been a couple of years since we've been to cheesecake factory.   We decided to give it a try today since there were no lines waiting outside the door.   I had the lunch portion of the four cheese pasta which tasted amazing.  I hate to see what the dinner portion looked like because I couldn't finish what i had.  The sauce with the ricotta cheese in the center was right the amount and when mixed in with parmesan cheese on top made this dish a hit.  Next I had the Adams peanutbutter  cheesecake....YUMMY.  I'm a big peanut butter fan and this didn't last long at the table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=20

Service was great, we were seated right away & our server was very attentive. I could say otherwise for my meal. One of our favorites from the restaurant is their bread. We had 3 rounds of bread, they were either burnt or hard. I ordered my usual, fettuccini alfredo with shrimp. The alfredo sauce was runny and the shrimp was dry & I found some that were stuck together. Not sure how that happens but I was surely disappointed. My husband's order, on the other hand, tasted 10x better than what I had and it was spaghetti and meatballs.

Skye K.,"Jacksonville, FL",48,3,,1.0,6/19/2017,"my wife and I just left the Cheesecake Factory thats located at 10260 midtown parkway Jacksonville Florida. we both ordered alcohol beverages, as my wife orders a mai Thai. It was very good at first but when she got to the middle of the drink it was very unbearable and she had me take a sip. it took everything in me to not spit it out on the table. I asked the server if she could take the drink back because my wife wasn't satisfied. so the the server went to take it back and came back out to see what was so bad about it. while she was inside she told the manage, Kenny, that she didn't like the drink and he came outside to talk to her about it. and asked what was wrong with the drink, proceeded to say that my wife asked him to take it off the bill, which she never said. and then he said that he can't because it was more than half way gone, which it wasn't. and she looked at him saying I never said that, all I wanted was it to be taken back. he said that he will take it off anyways, while he was giving her attitude. so she wanted to leave as we didn't finish our food because he was very rude to her. as he was leaving she asked if we can get to go boxes and as he was walking back in he said under his breath that he isn't going to bring us boxes that he will get someone else to do it because he said that he felt very uncomfortable.  as he approached us in the beginning not asking about our food, I could tell that he already started off on the wrong foot, he was being judgmental to us before the situation occurred because I took my wife out for dinner, which might I add I am also a woman and in a bi-racial relationship. his customer service skills were very poor. on our way home my wife decided to call them and asked to speak to him again. so she could understand what he said to her as he was walking away. and he responded with I felt very uncomfortable, as he interrupted her. and then he said that I am not staying on this phone to argue with you and then he hung up on her.  I will never be eating there again. besides the issues that I stated above my wife asked for her burger medium well and it came out well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=60
Rob C.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,4,4,4.0,10/17/2016,"I went on a Monday night to watch football at the bar and to have dinner. The atmosphere was very pleasant and professional. The lighting and music levels were spot on. They both complimented my experience. For dinner, I had the pasta Carbonara. It was perfect.  The egg sauce was delicious. The pasta was al dente. The peas were firm. The amount of bacon was nice and subtle. I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake for desert. The cheesecake was very nice.  After the healthy portion size of the pasta I did not want a huge slice of cheesecake. The size of the slice was just what I wanted, reasonable and not gargantuan. The lemon and raspberry flavors worked very well together neither overpowered the other. The ladyfingers cookie crust was a very pleasant surprise. The price of my Beefeater martini was the only disappointment of my evening. The $12 price was a little steep but not a deal breaker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=60
Maya C.,"Jacksonville, FL",208,525,2100,4.0,10/27/2015,"Some friends were in town and both of them liked cheesecake but had never been to ""The Factory"". Mom and I decided to meet them one Sunday morning for brunch. Now I've been to the Town Center that early before so I knew where I could find a parking spot easily. (Nope, not sharing hahaha). We all met up and walked inside. It's about 11:45-Noon and there was no wait. Thank god. We sat in a booth on the side near the front. The ""Jags in London"" game was on and the bar area was full and glued to the TVs. Not interested. We spent most of the time gabbing but we did over food, eventually. I got a Strawberry Lemonade to drink and it was good but sweet. Most of the syrup was on the bottom. And the glasses it came in were huge! Wow. I spent most of the time stuck on the brunch and eggs & omelettes menu inserts since it was still that time and settled on the Crab Hash: Sauteed Crab, Red, Yellow, and Green Peppers, Onions and Potatoes, and topped with two Poached Eggs with Hollandaise Sauce. My dining companions were skeptical about that dish like, how much crab, is it real crab, is there a lot of hash, etc. But I bit the bullet, it sounded good and I was gonna get it. Our server was very attentive and brought us bread service and oh my goodness. I loved that the bread was of different varieties and the butter, while packaged, tasted freshly churned. It was about 15-20 mins before our food came out and I tore into it, after my family inspected it. It was delicious! Everything was great. I couldn't eat the toast that also came with it or all the potatoes. But that's ok. I was saving room for dessert I'd been told beforehand that they had Mango Key Lime Cheesecake so I only focused on that one and got it. The cheesecake was good but I really wasn't feeling the layer of shredded coconut on top of the crust. That's just my preference though.

After a lengthy wait they brought out food that was just as good as anything you might find in a Chef Boy R Dee can. The pasta was undercooked and hard. The chicken was cold and dry. You really have to work hard to ruin spaghetti but in this effort they succeeded. Upon calling out the disinterested manager I was still presented with a bill for $100.00.

Apparently since root beer was flat, I would want water, other options weren't even offered yet he still charged us for our sodas. .  Our food was decent for the most part once it finally arrived except that the steak sandwich was poor quality meat. The eggplant Parmesan is delicious but served with a pesto pasta that was dry (most likely from sitting).

But it's consistently delicious and that wins big in my book. On one of our recent trips to the Town Center we decided to pop in to an old stand by; we opted to grab a seat at the bar rather than wait for a table.   We ordered the salmon firecracker rolls to start. They are one of the highlighted items on the 'lighter options' menu. Definitely a tasty option and I loved that they weren't rolled in a heavy wrapper. Just the thinnest of wrappers that provided just the right amount of crunch. It's perfect for two people to share because you each get two pieces.  For my entree, I went with the Eggplant Parm Sandwich. Definitely a knife and fork kind of sandwich as it is top heavy with eggplant. My only complaint about the meal would be the preparation on the eggplant. I've learned to salt my eggplant (multiple times) at home to pull out all the excess water. It helps it not be as spongy in cooking. While I still ate every bite, the eggplant was approaching spongy. The sammie is so large, I had enough leftover to repurpose half my sandwich into a whole second sandwich the next day for lunch. Pressed eggplant held up very well.  We skipped on the cheesecake this time, but it didn't stop us from drooling over the menu. One day I will play it smart and order a small appetizer and a piece of cheesecake.

I do understand the uncertainty of never predicting how business will be in a restaurant but a fair judgment of giving wait times is only common curtesy.  When we were sat we noticed that we were sat in a section that a large party just got up so the poor server got quadruple sat with four two top tables. I completely felt for how he was feeling because I know how it is as a server to be in this position. He definitely didn't let the challenge stop him from delivering great service. We ordered both our favorite dirty martinis that are always delicious with fresh Blue cheese olives. We also ordered our favorite appetizer the shrimp spring rolls with a delicious peanut and ginger dipping sauce. My husband always gets his favorite pasta Da Vinci and I decided to try something new the luau salad which was absolutely phenomenal! The salad was enormous it could've fed four! With excellent flavors of mango, macadamia nuts thin sliced chicken all layered on crisp wontons with a sesame drizzle and green onions and green beans it was all so fresh and delicious. I will definitely order it again! Not to mention it will be lunch tomorrow! Overall the dinner was great and like any other dinner at cheesecake that leaves you very full and no room for cheesecake lol I guess you always have to expect this place to be super busy because obviously they're doing something right there food is always great and the services as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=100

Stewart P.,"Birmingham, AL",120,269,79,2.0,6/23/2015,"There is really only one reason to go to The Cheesecake Factory, and that is for cheesecake. I've never really understood why people choose to frequent this place when it is overpriced and the food is poor to mediocre in quality and flavor. However, the cheesecake is great (because all cheesecake is great)!  The only reason I actually stopped in for lunch was because a very gracious student gave me a gift card for the restaurant after I mentored her for a month. I've been to a few other locations in different cities throughout the nation and have had a similar experience (hey, at least they're consistent). I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (a horridly bland thing that I later found out has over 2000 calories!! - how!? The stuff tasted like nothing) that was aggravatingly disappointing. I love Louisiana and I love pasta so surely some sort of magic should have happened... but lets just say that it was très ennuyeux. It was an insult to one of the most vibrant areas of the country.  As far as service was concerned, it was pretty poor too. Our server was working way too many tables for his skill level and wasn't managing very well. Service was slow and not all that impressive.  The only thing that was great was the cheesecake... and let's face it, that's because it combines two of the greatest things known to man: cheese and cake. Voila! Ecstasy! Cheesecake factory is not the best cheesecake in the world but it is good and probably one of the better ones you'll find in Jax (although I can't be sure because I've never had cheesecake at any other restaurant in Jax so don't believe a word of that statement - I just assume that Jax isn't teeming with cheesecakeries).  Anyways, go here for the dessert. Get your dinner or lunch elsewhere.

My advice, tell your party to arrive earlier than you actually want to sit, be sure the majority of your party is present before putting your name on the list. They'll back list you otherwise. Here's what I ordered: passion fruit monitor (amazing), tomato basil pasta (too much garlic, not enough mozzarella), chicken picatta (decent), limoncello cheesecake (yummo, my fave), and tiramisu cheesecake (not bad). Now to the good, our server, Brent, was fantastic. Very patient and polite with a sense of humor. My drinks were always full and the food was timed great - even my take out meal.

Athena C.,"Jacksonville, FL",423,179,788,5.0,1/24/2014,"I'm finally writing this review now (a few months after my visit) because my dumb phone was in service at the Sprint in the town center.  My boyfriend and I were enjoying our day of errands and I begged him to let us go to Cheesecake Factory because I've been dying to go. I love cheesecake and apparently they also have regular meals here, too. Whodathought?! So, after trying to find parking in a very full Town Center we were the first people there. They open right at 11 am and we were seated right away in this big whopping table. I felt so tiny in the booth.  We started off with the parmesan-garlic cheese bread with the marinara sauce for dipping and a tortilla soup. The tortilla soup had a spicy little kick to it, but not enough to make the mouth burn too much. The bread was delicious, aside from the original bread they usually provide to snack on while you're waiting on your food. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich with French fries. I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The portions were generous, and by generous I mean there was no way I finishing that AND eating a piece of their fabulous cheesecake, too.  The chicken parmesan was perfectly cooked on the most deliciously toasted French bread. The French fries were on and nothing spectacular, but still filling. The sandwich was delicious.  My salmon was cooked to flaky perfection and the zesty lemon sauce made for a perfect complement to the herbs it was seasoned with. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes because I like the chunks of potatoes and the skins mixed into the creamy goodness. I thoroughly enjoyed my food and will be looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu.  I, of course, being the cheesecake fan that I am HAD to order some. I mean, it is, after all, the cheesecake factory, right? So after perusing the long list of over 30 flavors of cheesecake I finally decided on the White Chocolate and Macadamia Nut cheesecake.  *drools* it was the most decadent cheesecake with a delicious flavor I've ever had. I was floored and definitely ate EVERY bite of that delicious dessert.  The server was very nice and she suggested a lot of great choices when I had trouble choosing my lunch and my dessert, and I went with both of her suggestions. She was right on the money.  I will definitely be coming back because the service, The food, and the environment were absolutely top notch for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=120

RoverTreks T.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",2,129,52,3.0,12/16/2014,"5-Star cheesecake and 3-star dining experience I've thought about what rating to issue this place for 7-years.   And I've always struggled with my decision.   That's because there's a stark difference between the ""cheesecake experience"" and the ""rest of the restaurant"" experience. In short, if you go for the cheesecake, you'll experience is a 5.   Otherwise, this is just an average restaurant.   Details Seven years ago, I ate at this restaurant and left feeling something was not quite right about the experience.  Off and on since then, I've visited when in the area.  I've always come away with the same feeling.   This has been my experience every time I eat at this restaurant.   And I keep going back thinking that my next experience will be different.   Partly, that's because my experience with this chain has been good elsewhere. We've all been there.  At one time or another in our lives, we've eaten at a restaurant  and left with that ""something is not quite right"" feeling.   Either the food is tasteless, or ""off"", not fresh,  --- but not quite right.   And sometimes it is difficult to pin down what exactly is wrong or where improvements can be made. This raises a question:  how does one rate a place that is ""not quite right""?  An experience between 1 and 5 is average.  Hence, my 3-star rating.  I ordered a cup of coffee and a club sandwich with a salad as a side recently.  The coffee was burnt and I sent it back.  That was an easy call.  Either coffee is burnt or it isn't.   Foul tasting coffee usually stems from unclean brewers (white vinegar folks!) or leaving a pot coffee too long on a heating element. The club sandwich was beautiful.  The toast was just right.  Each section was chock full of meat and veggies with a skewer through the middle.  But they were tasteless.  My immediate thought was, ""why do I keep coming back?"" The salad was OK but there was something off about it too.  It was drenched in blue cheese dressing.  Perhaps this was the problem?  I can't say.    My wife ordered the lettuce Mexican tacos for lunch.  She reports they were OK, not great.  The good news?  The Peppermint Cheesecake was excellent.   When we left the restaurant my wife said, ""well, that was a waste of $40.  The only reason to go there is for the cheesecake"". And that's what we've resolved to do in the future.  I want to give this restaurant a 5-star rating -- truly I do.   I've written my consistent, visceral reaction here for the first time after visits over many years.    Usually, when I write less than stellar reviews, I try to leave tips for the restaurant to consider.  I wish I could be more specific here.  Go for the Cheesecake and you'll get a 5-star experience.  With all else, lower your expectations.  To be fair, I haven't tried all 200+ offerings.  Those I have tried, spanning salads, pizzas, heavier dinner-like entrees, to breakfasts are just OK at best.   I'm resolved.  This is a 3-star dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=120
Susan P.,"Jacksonville, FL",312,354,3051,3.0,3/29/2014,"This is my third or fourth visit to the cheesecake factory. They originally put us in this itty-bitty table right near the doorway but the waitress was very astute and noticed that we didn't really fit in there so she moved us to a booth. It was a Friday night at perhaps 9 o'clock so it was crowded but there was no wait. We ordered the fried avocado, zucchini and Portobello appetizer which was shockingly good. It's so simple but I never thought to fry avocado and it just explodes in your mouth with flavor. I also ordered the crab dip which was not so good. There was a good amount of crabmeat in the dip however it was probably overcooked so it was crab and cheese and possibly mayonnaise and it was very greasy. It was served with a handful of basically homemade croutons   This could have been so much better if executed correctly. We ordered two frozen drinks which turned out to be $10 apiece which is kind of expensive for Jacksonville for not really high-level alcohol brands. For dinner I ordered the Thai shrimp and chicken. The taste was quite good although they poured a ton of pepper on the shrimp which made it distracting. The presentation was nice and the food was good but probably because it was so late it appeared that the cooks were just on autopilot.  We also ordered a shrimp pasta which was supposed to have fried shrimp and a lemon cream sauce with Fettuccini noodles, mushrooms, and asparagus.  This also appears to be a victim of a tired cook. The flavor of the sauce was okay but the noodles were very dry and the shrimp appeared to be dunked in a batter and then sautéed in a pan. The results of that is that one side was crispy brown the other side was basically still soft batter   The waitress noticed that I could not eat the shrimp from my Thai  chicken and shrimp because it was just way too spicy completely covered with pepper, and she offered to take it back but I didn't want to get any ""special sauce""...  For dessert we ordered blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate and the DuLce de Leche cheesecake. Both were exceptionally delicious.  I also ordered the double chocolate cheesecake to bring home to my son and he said it was excellent also it was thick and rich and chocolatey.  All in all it was an adequate dining experience but the waitress was great. I might come back there but I would not order the menu items we ordered except for the fried zucchini avocado appetizer. Price for 2 drinks 2 apps 2 entrees and 3 cheesecakes was $110 before tip.

Jamie V.,"Jacksonville, FL",113,197,308,3.0,7/11/2013,"For a chain restaurant it's pretty decent.  I'm a big fan of the sweet corn tamale cakes - even found a copycat recipe and tried it.  Portions at this place are outrageous and I always end up taking at last half my meal home.   The addition of small plates to the menu was a nice touch.  My last visit was during a hot summer day and I didn't want anything too heavy.  My friend and I shared the kale salad, tamale cakes and lettuce wraps.  The kale salad was kale, cranberries, apples, almonds and green beans in a creamy dressing  We both really liked it.  The tamale cakes were fabulous as always.  And we barely touched the lettuce wraps.  I took the rest home for later.  I was tempted by the caramel macadamia nut white chocolate cheesecake but resisted.  Frankly I find many of the cheesecakes too rich and can only have a few bites. The restaurant was busy as usual but just a few minutes wait so quicker than normal.  Service was particularly slow.  I don't know if our server was overloaded or if we were a ""cheap"" check and got ignored.  I waited way longer than I like to get a to-go box and the check.    I'll also give this warning - be careful when paying with a credit card.  Both my mother and I had card numbers skimmed months apart from each other immediately after using them at Cheescake.  And both cards were higher limit credit cards that had not been used for a couple weeks prior to usage at Cheesecake.  My mom's card was duplicated and fraudulent charges made within two hours of paying.  My card was used within three days in Europe to buy about $2k worth of airplane tickets.  Both of us never had card numbers stolen before nor have we had an issues after.  Frankly, I think it's too similar to have been a coincidence and while I have absolutely no proof, I believe some servers were involved in a skimming ring.   I called management both times and was brushed off.  Obviously I've continued to go to the restaurant since I was there a couple weeks ago, but now I always use cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=120

And they were all wrong. Daughter ordered chicken quesadilla, she got cheese only. Some order buffalo chicken sandwich ONLY buffalo sauce same with everything on it BUT the buffalo sauce. My chicken was cold and tasteless (I ended up uses some ketchup to dip it in so it at least tasted like something) along with the side items being wrong as well. Husband order was delayed as they ran out or mashed potatoes.  This is not what we have experienced any other time we have gone to this establishment and quite shocked. The waitress was nice apologized over and over (kitchen screw up after screw up clearly not her fault) she asked her manager to come over to talk to us (we didn't ask for it she told us she had) Manager came over and said she was sorry.

Even after hearing me say we would lot return she just let us walk out not saying a word.  The manager on duty tonight needs some serious retraining so she can properly address customer concerns and assist her Staff.  Again not the waitress but the kitchen staff and manager that really blew it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=180

CJ S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,60,5,3.0,9/10/2015,"Located in the heart of the Town Center, Cheesecake Factory os your basic chain. I have eaten in this chain in NY, Jacksonville etc as a safe place when I did not know where to eat. However, the cheesecake is not New York Cheesecake by any standard. True New York Cheesecake is creamy, melt in your mouth and made with quality cream cheese and sour cream. Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake is simply ok. They cover their lack of quality ingredients (such as premium cheese) by utilizing half of the ""cheesecake"" disguised by peanut butter or cookie dough, red velvet et cetera. Those things should accentuate not make up half of the cheesecake. As for the dinners as Cheesecake Factory, they are your basic chain menu. They do not stand out as exceptional. However they are good in a pinch when other options are unavailable. I do not see where all the lines and excitement come from. Except perhaps because of the varieties of cheesecake.

Could have not shared...but it was plenty for 4 people. Chicken madeira is delish! My husband got the pork chop and was disappointed in the mashed potato ( too dry).

Jenny Mai D.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,36,46,2.0,4/16/2015,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory and I got to say this one does not live up to the restaurant's reputation. My family (cousin and her kid) and I had the Bang Bang Shrimp, fish tacos, and chicken enchiladas. I wasn't impressed with the Bang Bang shrimp at all, presentation wise and taste. The sauce was too tangy and not enought shrimp. The fish taco was the most depressing. I've had many fish tacos in my life and I got to say that was one of the worst. The taco wrap fell apart after one bit because the fish was probably placed there right of the grill without letting it drip away the water. The garnish for it was sadly not fresh. I mean my avacado looked lit it was cooked which is never good on a taco. I can say the enchiladas were the only thing I thought was decent because the cheesecake did not live up to expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=160

I was disgusted and informed the waitress. The manager came out after a few min to apologize, and stated that she did some research and found that it was a piece of plastic from the bag that the pasta came in.

Tanya B.,"Jacksonville, FL",13,52,50,1.0,10/19/2015,"I normally dont go out of my way to make a complaint but this just ticked me of through the roof. My husband and I FINALLY went on a date. We have a new baby (5 months) and its incredibly hard to get out of the house. We went all out, asked for the table we wanted. Waited 40 min specifically for it. (outside area) We needed a particular spot because we did have a stroller. We sat down, our waitress was very nice and all was good. After we ordered, 4 people sat down next to us. And they started smoking. And not just smoking, CHAIN SMOKING!!! Did I mention, I was with a 5 month baby? I politely asked one of the waiters (not our girl) if this was even allowed. She questioned it for a second and told me she would double check. She came back and told me they had full right to smoke and I kinda had to deal with it. She asked if we wanted to be moved inside and I said no. We waited 40 min to get this particular table. Our night was officially done! The 2 couples next to us over heard this and on purpose smoked away. Even when there food arrived. I was so upset and couldnt believe it! Didnt I go to a family restaurant or to a bar?!  When our food came, I honestly had no appetite. All I could smell is smoke. I barely ate it. It was disgusting to me. My husband finished eating and we were out! We left so fast! I couldnt believe we just paid for an evening out and we absolutely hated it! I couldnt believe the waitress couldnt tell them not to smoke or step out. I really want Cheesecake Factory to consider this situation and really do something about it.  I wasted an evening and around $50 bucks on a night that went from great to disaster!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=160

Craig E.,"Jacksonville, FL",47,58,5,3.0,7/5/2013,"I have eaten at a couple of Cheesecake Factory locations between NY and Florida, and they are all pretty consistent.  Food quality is always good, although often unremarkable.  That said, I have to admit I am not one to frequent what I call restaurant ""factories"" - large corporate chains where there is always a wait of some length, too many noisy people, etc.  On this particular outing, we arrived for dinner around 6 and had to wait a short time - 5 -10 minutes.  We got crammed into a very small table for 2 in a row of small tables with constant traffic behind us in the aisle.  One of the reasons I don't like these huge restaurant factories....... Drinks and appetizer course were delivered promptly, and we enjoyed the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls - although it was hard to find any shrimp in them.  We've had much better at our local Thai restaurant. Dinners were Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice, and Fish Tacos with cilantro rice and black beans on the side.  Both dishes were cooked right and the portions were generous.  The tacos were in soft corn tortillas, with a fairly substantial piece of fried fish in each.  A little lacking in seasoning, but good quality.  The brown rice made the Bang Bang plate more interesting, better texture than plain white rice and the sauce had a good balance of seasoning and mild heat.  However, if you have sampled the Bang Bang shrimp at a Bonefish Grill restaurant then Cheesecake Factory doesn't quite make the grade.  The Bonefish version is killer, Cheesecake Factory is just ok.  Of course, if you are eating at Cheesecake Factory - what do you have for dessert?  We had a piece of Reece's Peanut Butter and a piece of Lemon Raspberry Cream.  Hard to beat - they were everything we expected.  Then again, $7.50 for a slice of cheesecake?  We're not going to do that very often.  Bill with tax and tap went over $80. So, overall we enjoyed the food but think it is overpriced for what it is.  You can get better quality at independent local restaurants for less - except for the cheesecake.  If you like to spend too much in a crowded noisy restaurant for food that is decent but not exceptional (once again, excepting the cheesecake) - by all means go ahead.  Its not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jacksonville?start=160
Don L.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",451,210,13,2.0,10/19/2013,"Unlike our experience in Orlando, this location was NOT good.  My wife made the mistake of ordering a bone-in pork chop and it was the most horrible pork chop in the history of dining out!  So tough and absolutely tasteless!  Please take this thing off your menu - it would take a blind person without taste buds to enjoy this. My meatloaf was good.  The veggies that came with it were obviously frozen or canned as they turned into mushy grit the instant you put them in your mouth.  That absolute lack of texture was disgusting! The red velvet cheesecake was very good but the only highlight of the visit.  Service?  Not so great.  We told the waiter that the pork chop was horrible.  He apologized and left.  The pork chop was left uneaten and picked up with the dirty dishes.  Unfortunately, no manager ever came by to follow-up as should have been the case.
