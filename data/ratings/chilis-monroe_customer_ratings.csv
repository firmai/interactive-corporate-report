19,Jen W.,"Monroe, NC",30,11,,5.0,2013-03-30,"We went to Chili's on Friday for a belated anniversary dinner. It has been awhile sine I went to Chili's, but I realized Friday what I had been missing. The burger was very juicy came out pretty quickly. Andrew was our server and he was very nice and made sure we always had what we needed. The Texas Cheese Fries are to die for in my opinion. I wish you could have that on the side instead of their regular fries. I would actually pay a $1 more for the meal if they offered that with the entree. I will be back very soon. Maybe I will try their new pizza next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
14,Stephen M.,"Monroe, NC",14,13,,2.0,2014-03-20,"This Chili's has been a mainstay in our family's dining options ever since our youngest found their ribs.   Tonight we went to celebrate his report card and he of course ordered the ribs. I ordered the Rib Eye and a side of grilled shrimp.  I have ordered these grilled shrimp before and they are usually large and nice.  The waiter, who announced to us that this was his last night of training, brought us our food, sans the shrimp.  I was told that it was just taking a little longer.   Another 5 minutes later, and they presented me with a plate with 5-6 TINY and I mean TINY shrimp.  Nothing else.  No rice, no skewer, though these were so small they would never had fit on a skewer.  These were popcorn shrimp, and they wanted to charge me $3.75 for half a dozen of them.   When I complained, the other waitress merely smiled and informed us that they had ""switched to the smaller ones"" and that they would take it off the bill.  It is do disappointing to see a restaurant that already charges $2.50 for a glass of tea, cut costs by turning a side item into a total joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
21,Brittany P.,"Indian Trail, NC",104,4,,1.0,2014-07-22,"I've been in the industry for almost 10 years and this was by far the worst service I have ever received. I was in the area and wanted to cure my hangover, so I was looking for a Bloody Mary and a cheeseburger. My spouse and I sat at the bar and ordered our drinks. The bartender took about 20 minutes to make two bloody Mary's. They were filled with mostly vodka (it was 2pm, I don't want to get drunk) and a splash of mix. It was served with no garnishes. When she handed it to us, she asked if we wanted celery. After saying yes and asking for limes, she handed us a stick with limes on it and a basket of celery. I asked for mine spicy and after I had had my drink in front of me for 10 minutes, she then asked if I wanted some hot sauce for my drink. I might as well have made my own drink at this point. Then we ordered two medium rare burgers and after about 20 minutes with no food, we started getting pissy. It wasn't long before my spouse (who is a chef) and I realized that she had forgotten to ring our food in. At the end of our horrible experience, she ended it with a snide comment. ""I mean, it IS a Saturday. We are busy."" I will never step foot in that chilis again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe?start=20,,,,,
17,Shannon M.,"Matthews, NC",0,13,11.0,3.0,2015-01-22,"So, went here for lunch and got the chipotle chicken mex bowl, which was ok. You have a choice of side salad (fresco or house), I got house (iceberg lettuce) and my husband chose the ""fresco"" which I specifically asked the girl what was in it- it was new as she explained and she pointed out it's pic on the menu insert. As she explained and the pic clearly illustrated; it was sort of a ""spring leaf"" mix with a vinaigrette. My husband recvd a bowl of iceberg lettuce with couple of sprigs of ""spring leaf mix"" on top and it was DRENCHED in vinaigrette- take a look at the bottom of his bowl (pic is posted here). As well, the plastic drink mugs were disgusting - scratched and gross on the bottom underside. You can do better Chilis, I've seen it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
16,John B.,"Indian Trail, NC",6,4,3.0,1.0,2015-01-27,"It's been better but tonight they had empty tables and no one to clean them. Then she sat us at a table for two that was empty when we first walked in, ugh. Not happy tonight",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
15,Jeff F.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,6,2.0,1.0,2015-04-19,"Worst  chili's  I have  ever been  to . bartender  with  a gotee is a total  douche  bag,and tried to  hit on me while  I'm clearly  straight? Wtf",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
9,Kristen M.,"Waxhaw, NC",3,36,21.0,2.0,2015-09-20,"This has always been our go to restaurants, because out of all of them we could count on great food and great service.  This time something was just ""a little off "". The Chips & Spinach n Artichoke Dip seemed different, not at all what I am used to. Not good, not bad, just ""different"", and it's usually amazing!  The fall off the bone ribs weren't falling off the bones (our ribs at home are MUCH Better!) and the atmosphere was unusually quiet, too quiet and I felt out of place.  Maybe it's the time of day..?  We usually go at night and will only go for dinner from now on. We've always been satisfied in the past and I'm hoping there hasn't been a change in ownership that is to blame..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
11,C M.,"Monroe, NC",24,21,5.0,2.0,2015-11-08,"Dirty floors, seated me (alone) near tables with screaming kids.  Waited 20 minutes so far for a flatbread pizza   Tea is all but tasteless.  Flatbread is goo but greasy. My waiter however was excellent and very gracious",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
13,Cindy T.,"Monroe, NC",11,4,,2.0,2016-01-02,"Chili's has been one of our go to places.  Tonight has changed that.  We arrived before the evening rush and were seated immediately.  We placed our order and got our drinks quickly.  It was downhill all the way from here.  It took an hour to get our food.  During that time the waitress didn't stop by to let us know what was taking so long, nor did the manager who passed our table several times.  When we finally got our food, my sirloin was covered with the garlic butter even though I had ordered it with no seasonings at all.  My husband's Chicken Crispers had been reheated, his corn on the cob was nearly cold and he had to wait on the fries.  He had to ask a second time for the fries and when received they were covered in salt which he specifically asked for no salt.   We noticed that very few meals were coming out of the kitchen and not many appetizers either.  We can only imagine what was going on.  I watched groups of people wait for tables nearly as long as we waited for food.   The manager did deduct $8.00 from the cost of my meal.  While I appreciate it, I would much rather have received my food on time and prepared as requested.  If that wasn't possible, then I would have appreciated being acknowledged that things were slow in the kitchen.   If you have small children I wouldn't recommend Chili's.  The waiting time could be more than they could handle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
12,Sherri B.,"Matthews, NC",0,5,,2.0,2016-04-27,"Waitstaff was great. All else was par.  I should have known that Chili's (in general) is ""upscal-ish"" Tex-Mex food. My daughter ordered from the kid's menu. She got the gross KRAFT mac-n-cheese. She couldn't even finish it. I ordered an expensive bar item (meh) but for food opted for the chicken soup. It was OK but I was given a plastic spoon b/c they were ""out"" of silverware. I am not a snob, but I am not paying for ANYTHING to be given plastic ""silverware."" Really?! NOT the sever's fault (I worked in many restaurants so I get it). I darned sure didn't appreciate that. But beware of the kids menu. I tasted my daughter's mac-n-cheese and it was NASTY. Had a great server but something was terribly off that night. I saw other tables leaving (at first now knowing what was up) but they must have had an off night. BTW...no more of this chain for us. If we want Mexican, we know where to go. Applebees in so much more appealing to families. Sorry, Chilis, but I really tried to give every benefit of the doubt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
10,Cathleen S.,"Cape Elizabeth, ME",0,9,,2.0,2016-07-15,"Way too much fat, saturated and trans, in the burger.  Fries tasted funny.  What was in that cooking oil?  Redneck atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
5,Teresa O.,"Monroe, NC",0,5,,1.0,2016-07-21,Why is it that this Chili's Sanitation grade continues to go down?  Today it is 87 ...bad...bad.  Does management not know how to fix the problem?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
6,Brandon P.,"Crouse, NC",0,6,,4.0,2016-09-19,"I ordered the honey chipotle chicken tenders, corn on the cob, and broccoli. It was all cooked perfectly and tasted great. Service was great also. I sat at the bar top And the bartender had the entire bar area by herself so it was a little hectic, but typical for a bar. All around had a good experience. I'll go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
8,James B.,"Monroe, NC",0,14,,1.0,2016-11-10,I agree on the bad service!!! the last 2 times have been BAD! I got up and left the last time. The problem I have is that I sent in to them recent a concern about this and the poor food and never got a reply from them We use to eat there 2 or more times a week,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
7,Jennifer H.,"Charlotte, NC",0,14,,1.0,2017-03-20,"My husband and I decided to give Chili's another shot last night for dinner. We were seated immediately, but after 13 minutes of waiting on for the waitstaff to acknowledge us, we got up and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
3,Kris M.,"Charlotte, NC",12,64,16.0,5.0,2017-04-13,"Just moved to the area and we love this Chilis! Where we lived before, we had 3 Chilis' to choose from and never really enjoyed any over the other. It was refreshing to have quick service on a Friday night along with friendly servers!! We will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
0,Ashley B.,"Indian Trail, NC",50,12,6.0,5.0,2017-05-20,We come here at least 1x a week and had had little to no issues. They do get very busy on weekends and it could be a long wait. This is my husbands favorite restraunt!! Always delicious food!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
4,Andy S.,"Harleston Village, Charleston, SC",5,5,,1.0,2017-06-09,"Worst dinner experience in a long time. Took 10 min to be seated and then waited for 15 min to order. No teamwork with the waiters. Food ok, wife's order was wrong. Will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
2,Joe E.,"Monroe, NC",0,4,5.0,2.0,2017-08-20,"We have been long time fans of chilis in general. We were thrilled to see a chilis in our new hometown. We came on the Fourth of July and the experience was pretty crummy- long wait for food, and food that didn't taste well. We assumed it was due to holiday. So- here we are again today- same thing. Food slow to come out. Clearly had been sitting under a warmer waiting. Food taste was sub-par. Beef enchiladas tasted awful!!!!!! I wouldn't feed them to our dogs. Very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
1,Cassie M.,"Monroe, NC",0,1,1.0,1.0,2017-12-28,Terrible!!  The server was rude! I had to ask for plates for our appetizers and believe it or not our plates were hotter than the food. The wings had most likely been sitting back here on the warmer for awhile. The cheese on them was not even melted. It was 2:00pm on a Thursday afternoon; it's not like they were slammed with customers. We won't be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monroe,,,,,
