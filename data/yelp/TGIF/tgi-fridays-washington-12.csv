Tiegan Y.,"Washington, DC",122,62,3,2.0,1/8/2018,"A friend and I wanted lunch, just to simply get out of the house and some how we ended up here and an experience it was, wow!  I'm not sure what happened, January 7, 2018 however, it was a twilight zone. No heat or staff. I wanted to leave moments after entering simply because of the very few employees that were there, never acknowledged us and it was so cold that my feet were hurting. When someone finally [noticed] us after walking by several times, she complained the entire time while seating us.  Took over 30 minutes for someone to wait on us after being seated and another 20 plus minutes for our food to arrive. I ordered the jack Daniels chicken sandwich and assuming that that they were trying to improvise, I literally had a half of a chicken breast. Who saved the day however, an extremely sweet and kind server named Joshua. I stayed because of him and he didn't not express and/or show any signs of frustration or complain.  Anyone who was there yesterday, I'm sure can attest and feel my pain. The experience was horrid and down right shocking. 2 stars because of Joshua and I am so grateful for people like him to make a bad situation not so bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12
Farah C.,"Riverdale Park, MD",119,40,19,1.0,10/2/2017,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had with any establishment. My fiancé and I were not greeted by anyone for about 5 minutes while we waited at the front with another customer. When the hostess finally came, she told us all to wait to be seated if not interested at sitting at the bar. The restaurant was mostly empty, but it still took 10 minutes for the hostess to come back to seat the 1st customer. I was surprised when the hostess barely came to the door where we were all seated and from about 6 feet from the girl waiting, said ""hey, come on"", and made a hand gesture for the girl to come to her. I was thinking ""wow... no excuse me or anything.""  About 10 more minutes went by as we waited to be seated and two groups came in after us. When the hostess came back, it seemed like she forgot we were there and proceeded to seat the other group of people, until my fiancé stood up from where we were to remind her we were still waiting. The hostess barely acknowledged us and as we approached she said (as if she just remembered us) ""oh, ya'll can go sit up there"" and pointed. I saw my fiancé look at her confused and said ""What? Where?"" She pointed again from the front of the restaurant and said ""that booth right back there"". As we walked back to the booth she pointed out, we both laughed frustratingly, wondering if this was really happening. We sat in the booth and looked at each other, watched waiters walk by, and bartenders making eye contact with us, but no one checked on our table or was even kind enough to smile, say ""hello"" or ""are you being helped"".  After about 5 minutes of looking around, being passed, etc. I began to laugh when I realized we weren't even seated with menus. We'd just been sitting there the whole time. No one had come by. My fiancé walked to the bar and requested the manager. We were informed the manager would come and speak to us. The manager NEVER came. For about 25 minutes, we reminded at least 4 employees that we were waiting to speak to the manager, each apparently going back and delivering the message. We even saw the same hostess point another group of people to the back booth instead of walking them back there. A lady in the group said ""can you show us? I don't know where I'm going"". While we were waiting, we saw 2 employees hugging and making out towards the back of the restaurant (not in the back- like where guests can't see), in plain view of guests. Bartender cleaning the drink prep area and bar, left dirty soap water in a little red bucket right on the bar where we were waiting to talk to the manager.  Finally, after one employee passed us for about the 4th time, my fiancé stopped her and asked her to assist us with getting the manager out. She stopped behind me and I was in the middle of them. As she began talking to him, I became uncomfortable as she was literally talking to the back of my head, like I was not there. So I moved and said ""I'm sorry. I don't like people standing behind me, talking to the back of my head."" (Side note: I really don't. I tell my child this all the time.) She informed us that she was the shift supervisor and asked what the problem was. As we began to explain the problem, the lady who we saw seated about 5 minutes earlier walked up to her asking if they could have menus. We had just prior informed the supervisor that we were not seated with menus. In the most unprofessional way, she yelled from the bar to the front of the restaurant to the hostess, in front of guests, ""why are you seating people without menus?"" Ummm... ma'am that's neither here nor there. You just lost 2 customers and are about to lose another set of customers, now is not the time to discipline your employee.  After asking for the general and district manager's info, we received it. No one ever apologized for our experience or even attempted to offer and make it right. Again, the manager NEVER came out and spoke to us. That's unheard of. This place needs to be shut down. Terrible representation of the TGIFriday's brand. We drove out to the Virginia location right after we left and received much better service than at this DC location. Shameful... I was raised in DC and lived here my whole life and never had such a poor experience in an establishment. I would advise, some go out to this site and do a thorough evaluation of their health and service standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12
C W.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced in any restaurant. I read the reviews online and they all have the same review; awful service. I should have went with what was posted,but decided to give it a try anyways as everyone has an opinion and I love Friday's everywhere else. For starters the hostess needs to be fired. Acted like she doesn't even work for the company. Once seated, waited 25 mins before we were greeted. Then once we ordered it came out 45 mins later and was wrong. Asked for the sloppy manager and he came out as if he was in the back watching television and we interrupted him. Basically the food was cold and service was awful. I will never visit Fridays again as this was the worst experience EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12

Adam P.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,,1.0,12/15/2017,"As a local, I'm extremely disappointed in this store. This has been the worst possible experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  It took over an hour for an Arnold Palmer and a beer to get to the table.  The food came out cold and 45 minutes after it was ordered. This isn't a high traffic restaurant either.  My colleague ordered 3 beers and it took over 20+ minutes each time one was ordered. STAY AWAY AND AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE. You can tell these waitresses pray on out of towners who will never be back again. We asked for the manager who never came and we waited 30 minutes to speak with him.

Jasmine R.,"Alexandria, VA",243,35,31,1.0,9/15/2017,"Some of the worst service I've ever had. My server was excellent but it took over five minutes to be seated. It felt like it was over a hundred degrees in the restaurant. The food took forever to come out, and while we waited for it, two guests at the bar had a very explicit yelling competition (conversation) that only stopped after we requested to speak to the manager and had him go over and ask them to speak more quietly. Manager was also very rude and seemed to have limited customer service skills. Eat at any other location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12
David S.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,15,,1.0,6/11/2017,"Horrible experience. Told 20 minutes on arrival, ended up being 50. Half the restaurant was empty because they simply didn't have staff. And they all seemed to be trainees. Ordered my sirloin medium rare, and it was served medium well. Slow getting drinks and refills. Waitress never asked how things were.  Probably because she was too busy arguing with other staff or flirting with other staff and customers. In fact, most of the staff seemed to be more interested in hooking up than working. Couple of arguments between staff right next to our table. Drunk woman that appeared to be a friend or off-work coworker that the staff was more interested in joking with.  Loudly and filthy. Never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12

Rob C.,"Alexandria, VA",26,24,43,4.0,1/2/2017,"Bar Experience Only: I always sit at the bar so thats all i can speak to that experience. It is hit or miss with the service and by hit or miss i mean decent to great.  I have seen a few people not satisfied with their bar experience but I have realistic expectstions.  Bad: When there's a shift change the new bartender is more comcerned with stocking the bar than attending to the guests (there should be an overlap so the bar can get stocked and customer service isnt sacrificed.) When it's packed the bartender tends to pick favorites, like regulars and friends. When this happens it takes a little more effort on the customer to get the attention of the bartender (bar backs should be allowed to pour water and soft drinks) At certain times of the day the music is too loud. I completely understand that during the school year they cater to young students and young urban locals but lowering the music would not negatively affect the atmosphere. Good: Bartenders are rather nice and know their drinks and like unusual drink requests. They love sports. - Pleasantly Inconsistent: Meals like cajun shrimp and chicken pasta are plesantly inconsistent. Its not always as creamy but it is always good.  The salmon and burgers are always made to order as requested. Drinks aren't always exactly the same but always good and the proces are some of if not the best in town. I don't frequent here as often as I used to but i enjoy 98% of my visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12

Closed out my tab and left after listening to him cry several times about being understaffed and having to make x amount of drinks blah blah blah....

About 30-40 minutes passed until our entree came out and would you believe it? 5 out of the 6 meals were wrong. Totally off. I understand it was her first day but only getting one meal right? Cmon. We had to wait another 30 minutes for the right orders to come out. 3 of the orders were steak which were asked to be cooked Medium but were cooked Well. The manager took our food back and gave us 20% off the bill. But the biggest disaster of the night was the women's rest room. The counters are smashed and being held up by 2 2x4's. There's a door missing in one of the stalls and all around it looked like this bathroom belonged in an abandoned building somewhere. We ended up paying $91 for that mediocre dining experience which I felt was too much given only 2 people ended up eating there and we didn't have any alcoholic beverages but I didn't fight it because after 2+ hours I was more than ready to get out of there.

Mind you there's only three of us, we passed several empty tables and booths to be seated there..with two other black families in the back room that was beyond dingy and suspect. I had flashbacks to the 1950's and I was born in the 90's. I chose to overlook this until I opened the menu he had just handed us and the pages began to fall out of the booklet. I'm sorry but does TGI Fridays not fund them??? I looked at both of my family members and said ""Let's leave."" As we walked back I noticed several things yet again, empty tables and booths, well dressed people of Caucasian decent sitting in the booths and tables, as well as African Americans to be fair (most likely all at lunch). I believe they were sitting people according to who they thought would be less disturbing according to how they looked.

So i waited. While i waited, i had to use the restroom, GROSS. Bathroom looks like it's falling apart, toilets were nasty, one sink was broken. Needs maintenance.  After that, the man came with my order and I left, because i was on lunch break, I was rushing. I get to work and open the chicken app, and see some little quarter size pieces of chicken , I was about to take a pic but I was like no..its ok.. it may be a good enough amount for me. Tasted really good. I dipped the chicken in the sauce and at the last piece of chicken, after dipping, as im about to put the fork to my mouth, there is a long piece of hair hanging off.

Jeanna M.,"Washington, DC",5,40,93,2.0,11/9/2015,I am curious to know how this TGI Friday's location is still open?? Is it the amount of revenue they bring in each week or each month....it must be. Because the service there is crappy. I've been to this location a total of 4 different times for 4 different events. All 4 times the service is unnecessarily slow. Even when the restaurant is not crowded...practically empty & the service is still slow. Yes the staff is polite but politeness will not stop my food from being cold when they bring it to the table. Politeness does not seem to prevent them from making us  wait 5-7 minutes before providing a menu or a glass of water or utensils to eat with. What exactly could be causing the staff of this popular restaurant to move soooo unnecessarily slow? Could this be the result of the staff gossiping amongst each other too much in between the customer service being provided? Or are the cooks continuously falling behind on the grill? I would really like to know. I'm all for giving a restaurant a chance to improve themselves but it's obvious this restaurant has no interest in doing so.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=120

Usually when I find myself at TGIF, it's not b/c I purposefully want to go there but bc I've exhausted my usual options in the Foggy Bottom area.  The other night, that was the exact situation I found myself in. The menus in general remind me a bit of the ones at Silver Diner, Apple Bee's, etc. But unlike Silver Diner, which offers breakfast options at all times of the day, and lower calorie options, TGIF doesn't. They have a few scattered ""lower calorie good price"" (or some variation) options but really not too many.  I got the Korean tacos, which come wrapped in corn tortillas.  It looks like the tacos were grilled or something b/c the veggies/lettuce in the tortillas were also brown.  They tasted okay but weren't hugely filling.  Frankly, I wasn't sure what exactly made these tacos ""Korean"" except that they came with sriracha sauce. Our waiter was friendly but he didn't seem to know the menu too well, specifically the drinks menu.  He had no clue what the Long Island Iced Tea cost but to be fair, at least he readily owned up to not knowing it, asked, and came back quickly with an answer.   All in all though, TGIF will likely remain a place I go to only when I've tired of the other options in Foggy Bottom.  It rings average time and time again and there's no specific reason to return promptly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=120

Mary Grace C.,"Oakton, VA",0,3,,1.0,6/11/2015,"To Whom It May Concern: Last night my friends and I had a lecture last night in Foggy Bottom DC that ended around 8:15 PM. We stopped into TGI Fridays because it was relatively empty and we had heard great things about your establishment. We were a party of 9 and I know that it's a lot for one server to handle but we were her only table and the place wasn't crowded by any means. We ordered our drinks and waited around for them to show up. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to bring out 3 waters, and 30 minutes for her to tell us that the restaurant was out of most of the drinks that we had ordered in the first place.  One of my friends received a coke that was extremely watered down, and it took forever for her to get ahold of someone to fix that. The waitress just kept apologizing, saying that the bar was extremely backed up and that she can only serve drinks as fast as they are made, which is understandable. Two people at my table ended up going to the bar and getting their own drinks, which took them 5 minutes in total so was the bar tender really all that busy? You tell me. Some of us ordered apps and others entrees, and we were informed that the apps would come out before the entrees. I have been a server for the past two years and I know that if the situation arises where food will come out at different times, you send the tickets at different times to ensure that everyone will be eating together. The apps came out THIRTY minutes after they were ordered, and we added four more people to our party. They ordered some drinks and apps and we told them that we would probably be here for a while due to extremely slow service.  Their drinks came with everyone's main meals, except for mine.  This was about FOURTY FIVE minutes into our visit and the only thing I had in front of me was a glass of water. You'd think that a place like TGI Fridays would have people in and out in forty-five minutes, but I was way wrong there. The apps of the latecomers came five minutes later and I decided to ask the waitress if she had just simply forgotten about my meal, and this was her response: ""oh honey, we are just so busy back there in the kitchen tonight. You see, I can only put in a meal ticket and wait for it to come out. Don't worry baby, we'll get it out to you soon."" Okay, hold up. After two different customer service training programs, I have been taught that it is NEVER okay to call your customer's baby or honey, especially when their simple needs have not been met. The waitress could see that I was very upset and without hearing me out, immediately rushed to get the manager. I didn't want to have to deal with the manager if I didn't have to because I know that bringing a manager is the last resort in a situation, according to basic customer service principles. When the manager came over to speak with me, I had hoped to just explain the problem to him because the waitress had cut me off. I started to talk to him and he cut me off just like our waitress had, and immediately said don't worry- your meal is on us. To a normal customer, that might be just what they were looking for, but not for me. Having been in the restaurant business, I know that it is always important to listen to your customers and hear out their problems, which both the waitress and manager failed to do. I would have been more than happy to pay for my meal if I had been given the opportunity to explain why I was upset and try to prevent this problem for next time. Finally, a whole SIXTY minutes later, my food came out. I had originally ordered a half rack of ribs, and a side of mac & cheese. My plate came with fries, not the side I had ordered. The manager came and brought me my side, which was probably the only speedy service any of us had received that night. I had hoped that after one hour that I would be receiving the best rack of ribs that DC had to offer, but I was wrong- yet again. The food was very mediocre and I don't think anyone would ever be willing to pay full price for it.  After getting to your establishment at 8:20 PM, we would have never guessed that we would still be sitting there, come 10 PM. My friends and I are flabbergasted at the service we received last night and will not be returning to your establishment under any circumstances.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=120
Miriam S.,"Washington, DC",8,7,,1.0,5/12/2014,"Disappointing, to say the least. I went in with my Dad for a late dinner (9:30-10ish), so we figured that since we'd pretty much beat the dinner crowd that we'd have no problem getting service.  I'll start out with the positive: they got my order right, even in asking for things like sauce on the side, etc. I ordered the 6 oz. sirloin with the lemon butter on the side, and they did indeed remember. Now, for the things that didn't quite feel right: Another couple, while waiting for their table to be cleaned off, hovered near ours and started having a loud conversation. It was awkward and kind of killed our mood. Their table also wasn't cleared off till we were almost done with our meal, which was inexcusable since the restaurant wasn't even packed at 10 at night. Also, the music was way too loud and our food took way too long to come out. The waiter was pleasant, but didn't come around often enough. I went home that night after eating the sirloin and my stomach didn't quite feel right, either. Overall, while the food was alright when it got there it was not worth waiting for.

M W.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,7/15/2016,"It's unfortunate that I have to write this message, but after our experience, it would be advisable that this restaurant hire new bartenders and maybe management. Simply bad service and questionable staff integrity.  We decided to leave after an hour of torture, we told the manager that we did not desire to wait for our entrees.  Below are a few excerpts from me and my partner's conversation: 1. ""How is it that half of the tables in the restaurant empty but there is a 15 minute wait?"" We were quoted at 15 but it was closer to 25 before we decided to move to the bar. 2.""How can 20 minutes pass without a bartender acknowledging a new guest?""  There were three visible bartenders behind the bar and not one spoke to us over the hour that we sat there. A manager ended up taking our food and drink order. Guest that sat next to us expressed that that was their experience too. 3.""At what point is it okay for a bartender to blatantly ignore a customer?"" We asked a young lady-bartender with braids for two waters, after 15 minutes we noticed that she was still engaging employees and referring to a recipe book. We tried to get her attention several times and she ignored us. 4.""How do you visibly serve guests next to us and not engage us to make sure that we are ok?""  One bartender, she had a pony tail, did just that. Several times over the course of the hour that we were sitting at the bar. She told guest next to us that they didn't have to pay...for whatever reason. 5.""Are staff supposed to be dismissive when voicing concerned over quality?"" The manager/waiter (Daryn?) was very defiant when I voiced concern over the quality of my drink.  It was a Jack Daniels on the rocks, that tasted like it had been mixed with a rail bourbon. He basically told me that there was nothing that he could do about it. He assured that it came out the bottle and did not offer any consolation.  6.""Are non staff members allowed to engage bartenders behind the bar?"" A young lady, who appeared to be dressed in pajamas with a head wrap had an extended discussion with another bartender behind the bar. The bartender was wearing a latex glove and had a shoulder length hair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=120

Still, a recent trip (12/1/10) inspired me to review it. I graduated from GW in 2000. Over the course of my time there, I ate at that Fridays and the Bertucci's across the street only about a thousand times. I make no apologies, its what you do at GW.  But this Friday's has something special: The backroom.  It says to college underclassmen, ""This is a good time with friends!"" Apparently it says that to high school students as well. I'll get to that shortly. A student group I was a member of at GW would get the Friday's backroom from time to time. As a college underclassman, these occasions felt like big events.  If I'm looking objectively, the backroom is not anything special if you're not a GW student. An old-school standard definition TV and dated wood cabinets adorn the space. There is an illuminated GW logo that gives the room some gravitas if you're a youngin'. I will post pictures when I return home.  I am a chaperone for a high school field trip. The first night, the group decided to go to the backroom of Friday's. They had done it in the past. It was like they drawn there like a magnet. It was nice to remember my college occasions there ten plus years ago now.  The Friday's menu is decent. I'm actually trying to cut back so I got the tropical salad with shrimp but forgot to ask for the calorie cutting measure of having the dressing on the side. Good salad.

A group of six each ordered an entree 2. 25min later 3 of the entrees came out 3. 15min later 3 of us were still waiting on our food Now the first 2 entrees were cold (one was a salad)' 4. When the last 3 meals came out they were the WRONG orders 5. Food went back, manager came to apologize etc. 6. 20min later they delivered revised versions of the food. It was terribly underwhelming in terms of service and the food was just OK. The manager gave each of us gift cards for $5 to compensate for the issues. It was a pretty awful experience and now that I see our experience wasn't an isolated one it's clear that there are management issues at this location.  Poorly trained servers, and a management team that would rather throw away corporate $ by handing out gift cards than educating their staff. That is not a recipe for success.

My friends and I have been here quite a few times. I am also a college student, so when we have received not so great service or mistakes, we've gotten things free, which makes EVERYTHING [well everything we've experienced] better. When looking for a place to hang out and grab something to eat, I see nothing wrong with this Friday's. Since it is near GW, there is sometimes a wait, especially on Friday and Saturdays. Their late night happy hour is pretty good. I think like half off appetizers and 3 or 4 dollar drinks? I think it's from 9 or 10 until close. And they make them really strong, which I appreciate as a struggling-to-make-ends-meet college student. [that doesn't go to GW, because if you do you can just your meal dollars or whatever they call them] I'm a senior in college and have been to this Friday's countless times since my freshman year. With that being said, I have never had bad food from here.  If you're looking for the dining experience of a TGI Friday's, go to this TGI Friday's.

The manager was nice and gave us an appetizer because the temperature was pretty unbearable.  + The service could have been better. It took one of my friends like a good half hour to get her food, after all our food was delivered. Apparently, her meal was sitting out on the counter for 20 mins and the waiter never brought it.

Kara K.,"Washington, DC",0,6,,1.0,3/12/2016,"Okay so, this is the place where the Antichrist was born. First, we called ahead for a table for 11 people. When we got to the table, there were 10 chairs.  Next, it took our waiter 20 minutes to take our drink and food order. We figured by the rate of slow service that it would be better to order food and drink together. How the hell fucking ever, we were wrong. It then took our waiter 20 minutes later to even bring our drinks. We had our drinks for about 3 minutes before he brought us refills of all of our drinks, joking that we were drinking them too slowly. The waiter spilled water on one of my friends. It then took forty minutes for half of the food to arrive. The rest of the food came twenty minutes later, while the rest of us had already finished eating. The final plate of food came out as we were asking for the checks and leaving. Some people received charcoal burgers, and my friend asked for a cup of ranch dressing and then received a cup of mayonnaise instead. The waiter finally came back with real ranch, after she had consumed her wings. Finally, once our checks came some of us were charged for two drinks and the waiter was very disorganized in taking our payment methods and receipts. My friend joked that the waiter must not have even worked there, because he was so under qualified and slow. We were very disappointed for my birthday dinner, and do not plan on going back any time soon.  If you want your intestines to fall out of your anal cavity, and die of low blood sugar while you're waiting for your soot coated ""Jack Daniels"" burger, I highly recommend this extravagant TGI fridays institution.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=60

We literally sat there for 15 minutes NO LIE and never received any service. Servers walked by but no one stopped, no one said anything. Idk why, bc they barely had any customers! Finally some guy walks pass and he keeps walking until my colleague yells out ""hello? Can we get some service??"" And he just replies back ""One minute man m'am. Then say says ""No one has come to take yalls order?"" We are all like ""no!"" And he says let me go get someone. FORREAL?! He could hv at least taken our drink orders or asked if everyone was okay to hv water right now while he goes and finds our waiter. Ugh. We waited five more minutes and literally walked out.

Worst experience ever.  I wish I could give this place a negative star. We took a trip to DC for my birthday and the first night there we decided to eat somewhere close by. Since I've been to Friday's a million times I thought it was a safe bet since we were familiar with them-boy were we wrong.  We walked in and passed a 2 people outside gossiping really loud. After standing inside the doorway for a few minutes we see them stroll in and realize they were actually the hostess and the waiter. We were so confused as we walked by and they did not even acknowledge us or even pause their conversation to greet us. We ask for a table for 2 and the hostess said Yea.... not sure what the yea meant . few minutes later a waiter walking by asks what we need and we tell him a booth for two and he asks us to follow him. We do and he leads us to a filthy table with the plates still there and he goes "" oh my bad. Stand here I'll be back"". The restaurant is basically empty so why do we have to wait until you clean this table? So after about 5 minutes we sit down. Now it's the day before my birthday and we've been travelling all day so we kinda want to let lose.. but there's no music or anything just the TV on. We ask for drink and app specials and the waiter  said there are none. I have been to multiple Fridays in multiple states and countries- there are always drinks specials. So i decide to look it up on my phone myself and order the drinks I saw.  AS we are ordering drinks and apps I look at the waiter only to realize he is watching the TV over our heads and not even pretending to write our orders down. I stop talking and stare at him and after a few moments he snaps back and say "" oh yea so you want what again?"" Seriously? After we finally get that part of the order in, he tries to take the menu from us. I explain we actually want to order entrees and requests he leaves them. He puts our order in and disappears for a little while. He then drops off everything and as i reach to grab the menu to place the entree order, he basically runs away and I watch him as he goes and sit down, puts up his feet and watch the game. He doesn't check on us or ask if ok-I couldn't believe he was on the clock and just watching TV. We ended up ordering our entrees 20 mins after our apps when the game finally ended.

We were seated back in the corner ""away"" from the rowdy tables that were knocking over drinks (literally), kids jumping from the upstairs bar  to the seating area level below - right in front of our table. Took more than five minutes for anyone to come by out table, even though I counted no fewer than five different servers tending to the neighboring two tables.  Finally, drink orders in and I was ready to order Mac and Cheese (no soup, but the mac and cheese also doesn't require chewing). That was the plan except we sat for 10 minutes without drinks delivered or a return visit from any of the five+ servers wandering around. So we left. And I went to bed hungry. Thanks, TGI Friday's.

Cody S.,"Sumter, SC",1,1,,2.0,8/15/2013,"By far the worst restaurant experience ever.  The general lack of service is the worst part.  The staff were outside hanging out while we were waiting to be seated (~10 min).  Throughout the night there seemed to be no rush to serve anyone.  You could hear several tables trying to order things as the staff walked away.   Once we had our seats, I started with a beer and a spinach artichoke dip.  The beer took 15-20 minutes to arrive (this was average for the night) and the dip was shortly after.  The dip was good but the chips were stale.  As far a the main course went, I had a sirloin and shrimp.  The main course was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=180

Holly W.,"Wichita, KS",45,18,,1.0,7/31/2011,"As first-time visitors to Washington DC, my husband and I were looking for a good spot to get dinner after a long flight. We found TGI Friday's was within walking distance from our hotel - so off we went. We both enjoy eating at TGI Friday's and we were anxious to get some of the good cooking we had enjoyed in the past.  We got to the restaurant about 7:30pm - the seating hostess was pleasant and put us right at a table. Let me go back a little because the moment we set foot inside the establishment we were greeted with eardrum-shattering rap music - apparently it was some kind of happy hour/karaoke night (on a Wednesday night). As we sat at the table waiting for our server to come by, we couldn't even hear each other across the table - the music was absolutely deafening!!! After looking through the menu and deciding what we wanted to eat, we twiddled our thumbs waiting for our server stop at our table. She seemed to go to every single table - but ours. In the 15 minutes we sat there - never once she she stop at our table or even look at us... let alone bring us any water or silverware. We couldn't flag her down because she never even looked our way!!  We decided to place an order to go since we both already had horrible headaches from the music and it was obvious that our server was not interested in helping us whatsoever. We were told we could place an order to go at the ""carry-out window"" at the back of the restaurant. So we headed back there and stood there for a few minutes before we were told that after 8pm, to-go orders must be placed at the bar. Fine. So we went up to the bar and again - every single bartender ignored us and helped others. It was so bad that the security guard in the restaurant actually went up to one of the bartenders - TWICE - and told him we had been standing there wanting to place an order. We waited another 15 minutes for a bartender to - reluctantly - come help us, and eventually had to CHASE them around the bar in order to get their attention. RIDICULOUS! I guess because we weren't spending money on booze and because I wasn't wearing a low-cut top or willing to flirt with the bartender - we were not worth his time. We waited ANOTHER 20 minutes for our food to be done before getting the heck out of there. The restaurant was disgustingly dirty with trash and spilled drinks on the floor. The bar itself reeked of urine as if people were just peeing where they sat.  In my entire life - I've never been treated like this in any restaurant I've ever gone to - it was horrible. We would've gone elsewhere - but it was already so late, most places nearby were already closed. If you have the choice - DO NOT go to this restaurant. Go somewhere else!

rachel w.,"Kissimmee, FL",3,212,2,1.0,7/20/2013,"Went to this restaurant just last night. Walked in, watched several employees walk by while we waited for host/hostess to come to the front. No, someone will be right with you, no nothing. Ok. When the host showed up we asked for a booth and were walked into the crowded bar and seated in the back. I said it was way too loud and asked to be moved to the mostly empty restaurant. We ended up almost at the front door again and were seated in a booth there. Ok. We sat there for a good 10 minutes before a young man came by, introduced himself as our waiter and said he would be right with us. No prob. The guy must be really busy! Only two minutes later I saw him standing near the beverage dispenser chatting it up with 4 waitresses. I watched him for a few minutes and discovered that all 5 employees were busy socializing. Niiiiice. We got up and walked out. Nobody cared except for the fact that then the waiter complained to the host he had another table to clean up. Since we did not even get water I doubted there was much to clean up. I guess the folks working here are here to socialize and are not worried about working or making money.

I live across the street from this restaurant so I desperately want to like it but no matter how hard I try I can't force myself to stomach the food. Literally everything in this place is COATED with butter and grease. Just about every item on the menu is deep fried (even the bread!), and you never leave feeling even remotely good about yourself.  The quality of the food is appalling - it tastes (and usually looks) as if it has come straight from a microwave.  The service is not particularly fast, but it is friendly and helpful. Meals are typically under $20, but considering the quality of the food anything more than the price of a $4 microwave dinner is too much to pay for a meal here.  The one thing that you must admire about Fridays is its consistency.

T H.,"Falls Church, VA",145,151,1,4.0,12/5/2008,"I am absolutely NOT ashamed to admit that I love this Friday's. Sure, service is a little slow (very slow) and unenthusiastic, and true, portions are a tad smaller than you'd expect at a low-end chain restaurant, but that's just water under the bridge to obesity and heart failure. The food is cheap and delicious, and for a poor grad student, that is so much more important than good service. Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp -- Chicken + Shrimp sitting in a pool of melted cheese and grease? Sounds gross, but is actually quite delightful. I'd never have paired seafood and cheese myself, but somehow it works. I loved the slightly burnt, crispy cheese on the edges. Also, the mashed potatoes are ridiculously good. Chicken Club Sandwich -- Chicken + Avocados + Pesto Mayo + Toasted Bread = winning combination every time. The chicken can be a little dry, but the mushy avocados and oily mayo easily compensate for it. I just wish the slices of lettuce and tomato were a little bigger. Cheesy Bacon Cheeseburger -- Bacon + American Cheese + Provolone Cheese + Dead Cow = my new favorite food. The Provolone is DEEP FRIED. I thought at first that there was a McDonald's-style hashbrown topping my burger until I bit into it and realized it was a gooey fried patty of cheese. They weren't kidding when they said the burger was ""cheesy"" -- every bite had me pulling away thick strings of cheese (and wiping away the grease that dripped down my chin). YUM. Girly drinks -- Try the tropical mojito or the berry caipirinha. So sweet, so delicious, so potent.

And yeah, it's often a mostly black crowd at the bar and if you can't deal, then you're a racist and you can go live on another planet, bye. This place is really more of a ""local hang-out"" than what I would normally consider a franchise restaurant. If you go there frequently, you learn which bartenders are going to dump half a bottle of vodka in your drink and which ones are going to skimp. (Hint: if you're not at the bar, they'll skimp.) I go because my co-workers know everybody here and even though I am a pretty hardcore introvert, I love hanging out, grabbing a drink, and being able to make small talk with strangers (or just sit by myself while my co-workers are hobnobbing with everyone else). I went here for my birthday and it was rather disappointing. We had a table as it was too crowded at the bar, meaning my drinks were skimpy, and my Jack and Coke watered down. A friend with a vertical ID wasn't allowed to buy alcohol, which is silly. (For the record, I have my ABRA license, and it just doesn't make sense for someone underage to spend the cash to get a fake ID that ISN'T horizontal--so you're more likely to be turning down a legitimate vertical ID from someone who can't easily go home and renew their ID after they turn 21, being in college away from home.) I ordered some sort of nacho dish, and the nachos were actually fried potato chips. They were yummy, but it wasn't what I was expecting.

Chris P.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,1.0,5/11/2014,"I went to GW, I love to go back from time to time. Still live in the area, and I find my myself in Foggy Bottom every now and again. I'm an open-minded person; I'm not from the ""Greatest Generation"", people are people are people to me, AND I still wait tables part-time, so I know what to look for in service.  There's no way to say this but to say it: In ten years in and around DC, this Friday's is the only place I've truly experienced reverse discrimination. Not just tonight, but the last few times I've been in this place. It was clearly upsetting/angering enough that I (who almost never writes Yelp reviews) thought I'd share this. I took a girl out on a date tonight, and since Froggy Bottom is closed Sundays, we stumbled across TGI Friday's on our way to Tonic. Sat down at the bar, and I ran to the bathroom where I found a drunk guy passed out on the floor and helped him up. Ten minutes later I came back, and she still hadn't been helped. FINALLY the bartender came up to us, I got a beer and she a glass of wine. I got the beer instantly (we could see the taps), but it was at least ten more until she got her wine. Ok. You couldn't find a wine key. It happens. We sat there and chatted for awhile, granted drinking slowly, so no need for helicopter attention. She got a second glass, no problem. Then my beer ran out. I kid you not, I made eye contact with the bartender multiple times trying to get her attention. She ignored me. I asked a second bartender for a beer, he said ""No problem"" and walked away. I could SEE the taps from my chair! Meanwhile, my date SLOWLY finishes her glass of wine, and as she took the last sip (15 minutes later) my beer arrives. Ok, maybe the keg kicked. And you had to drive to Pennsylvania to get some fresh Yuengling. It happens. What bothered me was this: As we were sitting there getting TERRIBLE service, staring at empty glasses, everyone else at the bar was getting served left and right, full drinks and living it up. At least four times the bartenders walked past my ten-minute-old empty glass to refill someone's who still had a sip left. Thank God I was on a date and trying to impress this girl, because my blood was boiling, and in her absence I would've made a horrific scene... And you know what the crying shame is? I paid my way through college waiting tables, still do it part-time, and I'm the kind of guy who leaves a $50 tip on a $50 tab. Even with DECENT service! The ""waiter"" in me still wouldn't allow me to tip less than 20%, but these bartenders made a huge (and costly) mistake ignoring us because we weren't of the same ethnicity as everyone else at the bar.  Bottom line: Give everyone good service, because you never know who's gonna leave you a massive tip. And if you don't, you never know who's gonna call you out on Yelp ;) ...To her credit (the bartender's), she comped one of my beers for her ineptitude. I appreciated this somewhat, but I was (and am) seeing red. Band-Aid on a broken leg.  The atmosphere is ""chain"". The service is horrendous. The staff is racist.

When I'm dining as a party of 2, I usually get seated quickly, and served quickly, but with larger groups you can expect a wait, during high volume times like, lunch, happy hour, game days, and the weekend. It's Fridays! and everyone loves Friday.  From the fun, hypnotizing red and white stripes and quirky wall decorations, to the Stripes rewards and savings card! My favorite menu items are: Jack Daniel's Salmon & Grilled Shrimp Scampi, Friday's Shrimp, Oreo Madness, Vanilla Bean Cheeecake, Fried Mozarella, fried green beans and broccoli cheddar soup. I truly believe that it's Friday, no matter what day I'm dining, because that's just the feel in the atmosphere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=140
Edward L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/22/2014,"To be completely honest, I was quite shocked when I saw that this place only had two stars.  As a incoming sophomore from gwu who's been here four times, the place seems to have drastically improved its service and the time it takes to get food to the table. Although my freshman year I did see staff just chatting and not taking the job seriously, the two times I came here, both waiters were friendly, knowledgeable and especially accommodating, giving us a wide variety of recommendations and patience at my nagging (I always ask a lot of questions regarding what to pick). The server actually had the courteousness to ask me to check for myself whether my flat iron steak was cooked correctly. Fast and good service, decent food. Seems like this place has turned around from what it used to be based on the reviews I see here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=140

As much as GW costs, one isn't wrong for expecting the servers to float around on a cloud of money.  I've been here twice in the past two weeks. We were seated right away. The first time they put us next to the DJ who was setting up. We didn't notice that's what he was doing until his voice of God soundsystem burst our eardrums. The food was good, but then again they say that when you lose a sense the other ones become stronger. The service was pretty slow for a Wednesday afternoon. I got there 20 minutes after my party had ordered. Some of them got their food after I got mine. Go figure. The burger and fries that I had were on par with what you'd expect at a Fridays.  The second time I went was much better. Everyone was very friendly and courteous. The food came quickly and everything was good. This time I only got appetizers because they were half price during happy hour. The tostado nachos and spinach dip tasted exactly the same as they do at every other location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=100

I can't comment on their food because I never got an opportunity to order anything.  We thought we would play it safe and stopped in after walking around the city. What a mistake. First impressions are everything so as soon as we stepped foot in the door, I suggested we find somewhere else to go.  The music that was playing was some weird mix of 90's and hip hop. The ""hostess"" didn't even turn around until we said something to her. She then proceeded to turn her back on us and continue to stack up the menus before walking away abruptly. We stood there for a few minutes, confused as to what was going on. She finally came back to seat us.  Walking through the restaurant, I noticed that this did not look like any other TGI Friday's that I've ever been in. It was so dirty and old. I went into the bathroom to wash my hands and that was a BIG mistake. They were just awful.  Pages were falling out of the menus. People who appeared to work there passed by our table several times. We even flagged one woman down to let her know that no one has taken our order yet.  After waiting for 15 minutes without anyone acknowledging us, we got up and left.

Daniel D.,"Washington, DC",0,5,,1.0,5/18/2016,"TL;DR: (Possibly) Poor Management Bored ""Hostess"" Very Slow Service Wrong Order Steak Cooked Wrong Understaffed The hostesses were chatting as we walked up to the and continued to until we asked for their attention. We were sat after a long journey to the back of the restaurant where our hostess gave us contradicting menus - one had obsolete information on many items. Our server visited us after about ten minutes, apologizing in advance for his poor service as it was his first day at this restaurant. This was excusable to us and we actually really enjoyed our interactions with him. He was nice to us and casual in his conversation with us. We ordered two waters and one Angry Orchard - something that should arrive relatively quick. The waters took approximately ten more minutes. The Angry Orchard another ten minutes. He then left before taking our orders, but returned after about five more minutes. We ordered both a 10 oz. Sirloin with Langoustine Lobster topping with a side of Fries & a Salad and a Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. The food came after about fifteen minutes (which is actually pretty good). Our steak however was completely wrong. We asked for the 10 oz. steak to be split between two of us. The steaks (which were cooked to two completely different temperatures - medium rare and well somehow) were two 3 oz. steaks. We had received the petite sirloin (6 oz.) split into two. The lobster topping was most likely cooked from cheap and frozen lobster meat. The sauce was pretty good. The pasta, however was good. We had no silverware or salt & pepper and had to get them ourselves. After we got our silverware, our server brought us three spoons. Very unhelpful. At least the meal ended up somewhat cheap, as we were charged just for the petite sirloin instead of the 10 oz.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=100
Elijah H.,"Washington, DC",0,4,1,2.0,6/25/2015,This TGI Fridays has probably the worst customer service I have ever experienced and I'll tell you why.  I knew right off the bat that the service was going to be lousy not long after I walked in. As soon as I came in I expected a host to be waiting there to greet me and no one was there. I then decided I was suppose to seat myself and as I was going to find a booth I saw the host. It was a woman who was crouched down in a booth on her phone texting or doing whatever on her phone leaving the entrance unattended. I was shocked.  Next thing I was seated and ordered my drink and then my entree. As I had finished my entree I decided to order desert. That didn't happened for awhile as the waitress didn't check up on me for at least 10-20mins. Not only that but the place was almost empty and not even that many people were there. Talk about bad customer service!  The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the food I ordered was decent.

The food was fresh, came out in no time, she offered us a great drink, and all this after working 13 hours.  She was so great, and we were so glad we came here instead.  Please choose Friday's over Tonic every time.  It is well worth your time and money to come here at Fridays.

I stand up to look for her and no one to be found.

Wound up sitting at the bar for another 15-20 mins, with TWO bartenders now serving, and neither asking if I wanted to order or have anything to drink. I was planning to go in, have a drink while waiting for my food, and eating at home, but I wound up waiting for 30mins with no water or any friendliness. This is not my only bad experience but it is by far the worst! Also wanted a salad with chicken, and got no chicken, and asked for feta instead of goat cheese, only to be told AFTER receiving the salad that they were out of feta... the food was lacking, with undercheesed, salty sticks, and a boring salad I could have made better myself.

For lunch, we had a large party of 8 during the middle of GW's graduation weekend. Surprisingly, the restaurant was not that busy. We all enjoyed our food at a reasonable price and had a very funny server. On another Saturday at dinner time, our party of 4 enjoyed a lovely feast of appetizers, cocktails, and dinners, all prepared to perfection. The food isn't gourmet, but it's good, high-calorie cuisine. For the drinks, we ordered off the 7 day a week happy hour menu and I got a rum and pineapple cocktail. He poured it on the other side of the bar so I didn't watch how much of what went in to it, but it was the single strongest drink I've ever had. I told him that that was way too strong, but when he didn't offer to make another one immediately, I just asked him to bring me a half glass of pineapple juice and I'd pour it and mix it myself. I made quite a soggy mess of the bartop and napkins there, and really wish he'd just made a better drink to begin with.

Brian B.,"Washington, DC",129,192,190,4.0,9/6/2016,"When I heard that TGI Friday's had a special of unlimited appetizers for $10 I immediately called this location to find out if they were participating. Turns out, they were. Now before the dirty laundry Yelp elites trash this place (I can see they've already started), let's establish something first- No reasonable restaurant in their right mind would offer a deal this good. But TGIF had the plumbs to present what I would argue to be one of the boldest appetizer specials in sit-down family food chain history (your move, Applebee's). .  .  . . . After Drew bribed the host with five dollars to put us in a better, less overly air conditioned (and easily forgotten) part of the restaurant, we were attended to by a very spry and fun waitress named Jenay. She hooked us up and just brought us basically every appetizer on the menu so that we didn't have to keep specifying which we wanted next. She kept them coming! She also made us aware of the drink special of the night which was Long Island ice teas for $5. The drinks were stiff! It was also refreshing to see a woman as our waitress considering that, fun fact, TGIF only let men be waiters as late as 1975!!  I'm going to say three words that are going to blow your mind: Sriracha Buffalo Wings. Ever had them ? Didn't think so. They were toppest of knotch. I would have gotten a second order if I didn't feel the need to explore the entire pallet of TGIFs appetizer menu. Some mad scientist through trial and error figured out that combing these two beloved flavors would actually work in unison. The result was pure MDMA. They were the perfect amount of spicy and the chicken was tender. Kevin thought they were too hot but it's obvs that his Irish taste buds were just not prepared for it.  In conclusion, this place is far from perfect. Their potato skins, for instance looked like they were the same frozen TGIF potato skins you get at the grocery store and had just survived a grease-infused stroked while being heated up in the microwave. Their wontons were also less than perfect and had a stale-ish wrapping. They were ultimately not a total disappointment because the pork itself was on point and it's what's on the inside that matters most. But overall, their appetizer menu is strong and that makes for a great restaurant. I hope that TGIF will consider doing more promotions that keep their competitors honest and keep them at the forefront of chain-dining greatness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20
Brooke 'Elle' H.,"Manhattan, NY",89,20,16,1.0,1/13/2017,"Bullet points because it was a lot.  1. Tried to sit at the bar (we came in as party of 3). But there were no clean places at the bar. Literally, plates of food everywhere.  2. Stood at the front for about 5-7 minutes waiting to be seated. Never saw a host to come and help us (or the other 3 parties waiting). Finally when the host arrived, be walked through the door smelling like cigarettes and joking. Happy he's in a great mood, but he could be more apologetic about the wait. And if he was on break, someone else should've covered the front. (Have experience for years as a server and hostess. So, I get the business.) 3. Phone is ringing nonstop. Host comes back and jokingly asks why we didn't answer. I've been waiting for a while to be seated as I'm hungry, I'm not in the mood to joke about doing someone else's job.  4. Finally sat us at a ridiculously huge table. A table that could sit about 5-6. And we had no menus. And the table was sticky. We moved elsewhere to a clean table. (Not sure why we didn't get a right size of a table initially when they were clearly available.) 5. After moving, we finally got menus. But no word from a server. So, we moved to the bar as some seats became available.  6. Moved to a table that was dirty (as mentioned earlier that everything was messy and not bussed). Asked if we could sit there, female bartender mumbled to another bartender that we couldn't. Something about a low bartending staff. But Drea (yay! Drea!!!!!) volunteered to work our table.  7. We ordered drinks (there was already a happy hour menu on the table). Tried to get margaritas, but a bartender warned us that everyone sends them back because there's something wrong with their margarita mix. 8. There is no sense of urgency with hardly anybody. We're 60 minutes in of being there and there were still dirty dishes sitting around the bar. (They finally cleaned it up after 1.5 hours.) 9. Bartender comes to our booth to explain why she said we couldn't sit at the table. Didn't apologize but just wanted to clear the air.  10. Other bartender (male) has been so into setting of the music, he forgot to pour our drinks. (15 minutes after ordering -- I had been watching the clock.) 11. Got our drinks. Well, I just got mine. The other two in my party didn't get theirs. I got a beer in a can...no glass. (They get their drinks about 5 minutes later.) 12. 35 minutes after sitting, still no food menus. Table still hasn't been cleaned. (At this point we stay because we feel like we're doing a service for Yelpers.) 13. I ask for a menu because I wanted more than happy hour food. They bring ONE menu. None for the other two in my party.  14. Server didn't come back after 15-20 minutes. Female bartender came to take our order. Recommended a meal for one of us in our party. Buuuttttt she couldn't find it in the menu. Apparently, some of the menus are missing pages.  15. After sitting for an hour, still no water. No silverware. My friend had an appetizer. Annndddd nothing to eat with.

Josh L.,"Washington, DC",167,7,,1.0,11/8/2017,"This Friday's location turned me completely off from the minute I walked in the door. My partner and I walked in and waited nearly 10 minutes for the host, who was no where to be found. We even thought the restaurant might be closed until we saw other people eating at the bar. I had to walk around the restaurant to find someone, at which point no one showed up until a few minutes later. The icing on the cake was when a group of loud, rude and obnoxious young girls began to irritate us, and we were seated directly next to them. The waiter then waited on their table first and began to flirt with them and completely ignored the fact that we were there nearly 10 minutes before they were! I will not be back to this location! To add insult to injury, I paid nearly $5 for parking only to get so pissed off and leave, and completely waste money in the parking meter. This location has to do better!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20
Dave R.,"Oak Brook, IL",0,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,"Sat down and were greeted by a waitress who spent the entire time socializing with her family members at the table behind us. We ordered our drinks with the hostess (4 people), none of us got iced teas for over 25 minutes. Ordered food when we got our drinks finally, another 25 minutes go by and the waitress doesn't even return to check on us. We left money for our drinks and walked out. Do not go. Not worth the headache",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20
Yojary M.,"Silver Spring, MD",83,1,,1.0,5/2/2017,Literally the worst Fridays I ever been too. The waiter had the biggest attitude like he didn't want to be there it took him 15 mins to show up Brought out some drinks and not others (drinks took about 20mins to arrive) put it food order after about 35 mins the first plate arrived no other food arrived we ended up leaving the worst customer service and place I have ever been too,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20
Matt S.,"Hebron, KY",0,4,1,1.0,6/26/2017,The service is horrible. We waited over an hour for an appetizer. Finally gave up and left. This is a prime example of poor management. If I could give this negative stars I would.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20

Mia K.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,4,,1.0,4/9/2017,No stars should be possible. Worst service ever! I have never walked out before but the rudest servers left us no choice. The manager came by after an alarm and was so great and professional that we felt bad he's stuck with surely hostesses and waitresses.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20
Lia S.,"Danbury, CT",1,15,12,1.0,4/15/2017,"Service is terrible. Place is dirty with empty tables waiting to be cleaned all the while people are waiting in line for a table. Be prepared, service is really slow. I don't know what is going on with management at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-washington-12?start=20
